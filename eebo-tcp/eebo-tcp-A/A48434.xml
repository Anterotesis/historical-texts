            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Shall not trouble the Reader with any long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scourse to shew how the Scripture abounds with transposition of stories; how the holy Ghost doth eminently hereby shew, the Majesty of his style and Divine wisdome; how this is equally used in both Testaments; what need the student of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture hath, carefully to observe those dislocations; and what profit he may reape, by reducing them to their proper time and order. I shall only in brief give account of what I have done in the ensuing Treatise, which refers to that way of study of the New Testament.</p>
            <p>Some years ago I published <hi>The Harmony, Chronicle and Order of the Old Testament,</hi> observing what transpositions may be observed there, the reason of their dislocating, and where, in Chronicall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, is their proper time and place: and accordingly manifesting the genuine Order of the Books, Chapters, Stories and Prophesies through the whole Book. The New Testament being Written and Composed after the very same manner of texture, requireth the like observation, and having made the Assay upon the one, I could not but do the like by the other. I have therefore first observed the proper Time and Order of the Texts of the Evangelists, and how all the four may be reduced into the current of one Story, and thereby evidences ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of them themselves. I could willingly have published the Text it self in that Order, for so I have transcribed it from end to end, and so I offered it to the Press, but found its passage difficult: So that I have been forced to give directions for the so reading of it only by naming Chapters and verses. It would have been both more easie and more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to the Reader, had the Text of the four been laid before him in seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Columes, but his examining and ordering it in his own Bible by the intimations given, will cost more labour indeed, but will better confirm memory and understanding.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> do not much scruple the Reader with disloca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but the taking up of the times of the Stories, is not of little diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and yet in some particulars, of some necessity: These are observed where most materiall, according to what light and evidence may be had for them, either in the Text it self there, or elswhere. Especially I have indeavoured to observe the times of the writing of <hi>The Epistles,</hi> both
<pb facs="tcp:59067:7"/>
those that fall in, in those times that the Story of <hi>The Acts of the Apostles</hi> handleth, and those that were written afterward. For the fixing of some there is so plain ground from the Text that the time is determined cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly; for others, we are put to probability and conjecture, yet such ground to build conjecture on, that I hope there hath not been much roving from the mark. I must stand at the Readers censure.</p>
            <p>I was unwilling to have medled with <hi>The Revelation,</hi> partly because I have no minde to be bold in things of that nature [I see too much daring with that Book already] and partly, because I could not go along with the common stating of the times, and matters there: yet being necessita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the nature of the task, that I had undertaken, I could not but deal with the Times and Order of things spoken of in that Book: and that could not be done neither, without some speaking to the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: which I have conjectured at [referring all to better Judgements] by the best propriety of the Language and Dialect used, I could observe: where literally, and where allusively to be understood.</p>
            <p>Now because it would have been but a tedious task for the Reader, only to study upon the meer dislocations, and the ordering of them, or only to be pondering how to lay all in their right current, I have not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gone the way before him, but have shewed his way all along with variety of observations; as not obvious [for such would have but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded one tediousness to another] so I hope not unprofitable, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his delight.</p>
            <p>I have not set my self to Comment, but in a tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sient way to hint the clearing of some of the most conspicuous difficulties, and that partly from the Text it self, and partly from Talmudicall collections. Of which later I have alleadged very many, and the most of them I hope not impertinently, but for usefull illustration. For though it is true indeed that there are no greater enemies to <hi>Christ,</hi> nor greater deniers of the Doctrine of the Gospel, then the Hebrew Writers; yet as <hi>Cerah</hi>'s Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers, and the spoils of <hi>David</hi>'s enemies, were dedicated to the Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary service, so may the Records, to be met with in these men, be of most excellent use and improvement to the explication of a world of pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in the New Testament: Nay multitudes of passages not possibly to be explained, but from these Records. For since the scene of the most actings in it, was among the Jews, the speeches of Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles were to the Jews, and they Jews by birth and education that wrote the Gospels and Epistles, it is no wonder if it speak the Jews Dialect throughout, and glanceth at their Traditions, Opinions and Customs at every step. What Author in the world but he is best to be understood from the Writers and Dialect of his own Nation? What one <hi>Roman</hi> Writer can a man understandingly reade, unless he be well acquainted with their History, Customs, Propriety of phrases and common speech? So doth the New Testament, <hi>loquitur cum vulgo:</hi> Though it be penned in Greek, it speaks in the phrase of the Jewish Nation among whom it was penned all along, and there are multitudes of expressions in it which are not to be found but there and in the Jews Writings in all the vvorld. They are very much deceived that think the New Testament so very easie to be understood, because of the familiar doctrine it containeth, Faith and Repentance. It is true indeed, it is plainer as to the matter it
<pb facs="tcp:59067:7"/>
handleth, then the Old, because it is an unfolding of the Old: but for the attaining of the understanding of the expressions that it useth in these explications, you must go two steps further then you do about the Old, namely to observe vvhere and how it useth the <hi>Septuagints Greek,</hi> as it doth very commonly, and when it useth the Jews Idiome, or reference thereunto, which indeed it doth continually: A Student well versed in their Language and Writings would finde it no great difficulty to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate the New Testament into Talmudick language, almost from verse to verse, so close doth it speak all along to their common speech. The allegations that I have produced of this nature in this present Tract, I have done but cursorily, as not writing a Comment, but a running Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the Times, Order and History of the whole New Testament: So that it may be many of them may not speak to every Reader that full intent for which they are produced, and which, would I have spent time to have been their Interpreter [but I was willing to avoid prolixity] I could have made them to have spoken plainly. What I might have done in this kinde I shall shew but by one instance [which let not the Reader think tedious here, since I have avoided tediousness in this kinde all along hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter] and this is by a Comment in the way we have been speaking of but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one verse, and that is the 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> verse of the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> which I have picked out the rather, to make an exercitation upon, because it is generally held by all Expositors, that in it there is a plain reference to something in the Jewish Customs, which is the thing we have been mentioning.</p>
            <q>Whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger of Iudgement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>The sense which is ordinarily given of this verse in the construction of many Expositors, is made to referre unto the three sorts of Judicatories among the Jews: the lowest consisting of three Judges, the middle of twenty three, and the supream of seventy one. With which allusion and explication I cannot close, upon these three Reasons: 1. Because the lowest Judicatory to which they apply the word <hi>The Iudgement,</hi> had nothing to do in capitall matters: and so the conclusion of the verse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be understood in this verse, <hi>The murderer shall be in danger of being judged by the Iudicatory of three,</hi> for they judged no such thing; and answerably the first clause in this verse, where the same word <hi>The Iudgement</hi> is reserved, cannot have the same application. 2. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is used only in the second clause, and it will be hard to give a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why the middle <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> should only be so called [as that interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation makes it to be] when all the three, and most eminently the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, did bear that name. 3. To apply <hi>Gehenna ignis</hi> to penalty inflicted by the highest <hi>Sanhedrins,</hi> as divers do, doth cause so hard straining [as may be observed in the severall allusions that are framed of it] that it is very farre from an easily digested and current sense. I deny not indeed that <hi>Christ</hi> in the verse alluded to something of the Jews practises, in some point of Judicature, but unto what, I shall defer to conjecture, till its course come, in the method, in which it seemeth most genuine to take the unfolding of the verse up, and that is 1. To consider of three words in it; which also are to be met in other places, and so carry a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall

concernment with them, then to be confined unto this verse, and those are, <hi>Brother,</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, and <hi>Gehenna.</hi> 2. To consider of the three degrees of offences that are spoken of, namely <hi>causeless anger,</hi> saying <hi>Raka,</hi> and calling <hi>Thou fool.</hi> And 3. to consider of the three penalties denounced upon these offences, viz. <hi>Iudgement, The Councill,</hi> and <hi>Hell fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The word <hi>Brother,</hi> which doth so constantly wrap up all professors of the Name of <hi>Christ,</hi> in the signification of it, in the New Testament, may not unfitly be looked upon, by reflexion upon the sense of the word <hi>Neighbour</hi> in the Old Testament, as that was commonly interpreted and understood by the Jews: <hi>By using the word Neighbour</hi> [saith <hi>Rabbi Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than] he excludeth all the Heathen,</hi> Aruch. in <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And let this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of <hi>Maymony</hi> be well weighed: <hi>It is all one</hi> [saith he] <hi>to slay an Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite and to slay a Canaanite servant: he that doth either must be put to death for it: An Israelite that slayeth a stranger sojourner is not put to death by the Sanhedrin for it, because it is said, If a man come presumptuously upon his neighbour</hi> [Exod. 21.14.] <hi>and it is needless to say, he is not to be put to death for a Heathen. And it is all one for a man to kill another mans servant, or to kill his own servant, for he must die for either, because a servant hath taken upon him the Commandments, and is added to the possession of the Lord.</hi> In <hi>Rotseahh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>per.</hi> 2. By which it is apparent that they accounted all of their own Religion, and them only, to come under the title <hi>Neighbour</hi>; to which opinion how our Saviour speaketh you may observe in <hi>Luke</hi> 10.29, 30. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that in the Jewish Church there were those that went un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notion of <hi>Brethren,</hi> that is, <hi>Israelites,</hi> who were all of one blood; and those that went under the name of <hi>Neighbours,</hi> and those were they that came in from other Nations to their Religion: <hi>They shall no more teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother,</hi> Jer. 31.34, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now under the Gospel, where there is no distinction of Tribes and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reds, the word <hi>Brother</hi> is ordinarily used to signifie in the same lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude that <hi>Neighbour</hi> had done: namely all that come into the profession of the Gospel, and it is so taken also, as that had been, in contradistin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to a <hi>Heathen: Any man that is called a Brother,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.11. If <hi>thy brother</hi> offend thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let him be as <hi>a Heathen,</hi> Mat. 18.15, 17.</p>

               <hi>The valley of Hinnom,</hi> of which, and of the filthiness and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minableness of which place, there is so much spoken in Scripture. There was the horrid Idol <hi>Molech</hi> to which they burnt their children in the fire: <hi>And thither,</hi> as <hi>D.

            <p>From hence the Jews borrowed the word, and used it in their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry language, to betoken <hi>Hell:</hi> And the Text from which they especially translated the construction, seemeth to have been the last verse of the Prophesie of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> which by some of them is glossed thus, <hi>And they

See the phrase, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.33.</p>
            <p>And now we have done with words, let us come to sentences, and consider the offences that are prohibited, which are easily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be graduall, or one above another. About the first, <hi>viz. Causelesse anger,</hi> there needeth no explanation, the words and matter are plain enough.</p>
            <p>The second is, <hi>Whosoever shall say to his brother Racha.</hi> A nickname or scornfull title usuall which they disdainfully put one upon another, and very commonly: and therefore our Saviour hath specified in this word, the rather because it was of so common use among them, and they made no bones at it. Take these few examples, <hi>A certain man sought to betake himself to repentance</hi> [and restitution.] <hi>His wife said to him</hi> Rekah <hi>if thou make restitution, even thy girdle about thee is not thine own,</hi> &amp;c. Tanchum fol. 5. <hi>Rabbi Iochanan was teaching concerning the building of Ierusalem with Saphires and Diamonds,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>One of his scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars laughed him to scorn. But afterward being convinced of the truth of the thing, he saith to him, Rabbi, Do thou expound, for it is fit for thee to expound: as thou saidest so have I seen it: He saith to him</hi> Rekah, <hi>Hadst thou not seen thou wouldest not have beleeved,</hi> &amp;c. Midras Tillin. fol. 38. col. 4. <hi>To what is the thing like? To a King of flesh and blood who took to wife a Kings daughter: he saith to her, Wait and fill me a cup, but she would not: whereupon he was angry and put her away: She went and was married to a sordid fellow: and he saith to her, Wait and fill me a cup: She said unto him, Rekah, I am a Kings daughter,</hi> &amp;c. Idem in <hi>Psal.</hi> 137. <hi>A Gentile saith to an Israelite, I have a dainty dish, for thee to eat of. He saith What is it? He answers Swines flesh. He saith to him, Rekah, even what you kill of clean beasts is forbidden us, much more this.</hi> Tanch. fol. 18. col. 4.</p>
            <p>The third offence is to say to a brother, <hi>Thou fool,</hi> which how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish from <hi>Racha,</hi> which signifies <hi>an empty fellow,</hi> were some difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but that <hi>Solomon</hi> is a good Dictionary here for us, who takes the term continually for a wicked wretch and reprobate, and in oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to spirituall wisdom: So that in the first clause is condemned <hi>cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse anger</hi>; in the second, <hi>scornfull taunting and reproaching of a brother:</hi> and in the last, <hi>calling him a reprobate and wicked,</hi> or uncharitably censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb facs="tcp:59067:9"/>
his spirituall and eternall estate. And this last doth more especially hit the Scribes and Pharisees, who arrogated to themselves only to be called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Wisemen,</hi> but of all others had this scornfull and uncharitable opinion, <hi>This people that knoweth not the Law is cursed, Ioh.</hi> 7.49.</p>
            <p>And now for the penalties denounced upon these offences, let us look upon them, taking notice of these two traditions of the Jews, which our Saviour seemeth to face and to contradict. 1. That they accounted the command <hi>Thou shalt not kill,</hi> to aim only at actuall mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. So in their collecting of the 613 precepts out of the Law, they understand that command to mean but this, <hi>That one should not kill an Israelite:</hi> Vid. <hi>trip. Targ. ibid. Sepher Chinnuch ibid. Maym. in Rotseah: per.</hi> 1. And accordingly they allotted this only violation of it to judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Against this wilde glosse and practise he speaketh in the first clause: Ye have heard it said, <hi>Thou shalt not kill,</hi> and he that killeth or committeth actuall murder, is liable to judgement, and ye extend the violation of that Command no further; but I say to you, that cause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse anger against thy brother is a violation of that Command, and even that maketh a man liable to judgement. 2. They allotted only that murder to be judged by the Councill or <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by a man in <hi>propriâ personâ.</hi> Let them speak their own sense: <hi>A murderer is he that kils his neighbour with a stone, or with Iron: or that thrusts him into water or fire out of which it is not possible to get out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, if the man die he is guilty, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>.] But if he thrust him into fire or water, out of which it is possible to get out again, though he die, yet he is quit. He sets on him a dog or a serpent, he is quit: He intended to kill a stranger and kils an Israelite; To kill a little one, and kils one of stature: To hit him on the loins, and such a blow on the loins could not kill him, but it misses the loins and hits him on the heart and kils him: he is quit. He intended to hit him on the heart, and such a blow on the heart was enough to kill him, but it lights on the loins, and such a blow on the loins was not enough to kill him, yet he dies: he is quit. He intended to strike one of stature, and the blow was not enough to have killed one of stature, but it lights on a little one, and there was enough in the blow to have killed a little one, and he dies, yet he is quit, He intended to hit a little one, and there was enough in the blow to kill a little one, but it lights on one of stature, and there was not enough in the blow to kill one of stature, yet he dies: he is quit. R. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon saith, Though he intended to kill one, and kils another, he is quit,</hi> &amp;c. Talm. in Sanhedr. per. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Any one that kils his neighbour with his hand, as if he strike him with a sword, or with a stone that kils him, or strangles him till he die, or burns him in the fire, seeing that he kils him any how in his own person, lo such a one must be put to death by the Sanhedrin: But he that hires another to kill his neighbour, or that sends his servants and they kill him, or that violently thrusts him before a Lion, or the like, and the beast kils him: Any one of these is a shedder of blood, and the guilt of shedding of blood is upon him, and he is liable to death by the hand of heaven, but he is not to be put to death by the Sanhedrin. And whence is the proof that it must be thus? Because it is said,</hi> He that sheds mans blood, by man shall his blood be shed. <hi>This is he that slays a man himself, and not by the hand of another.</hi> Your
<pb facs="tcp:59067:9"/>
blood of your lives will I require: <hi>This is he that slays himself.</hi> At the hand of every beast will I require it: <hi>This is he that delivers up his neighbour before a beast to be rent in pieces.</hi> At the hand of man, even at the hand of every mans brother will I require the life of man: <hi>This is he that hires others to kill his neighbour: In this interpretation</hi> requiring <hi>is spoken of all the three,</hi> behold <hi>their judgement is delivered over to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> [or God.] <hi>And all these manslayers and the like, who are not liable to death by the Sanhedrin; if the King of Israel will slay them by the Iudgement of the Kingdom and the Law of Nations, he may,</hi> &amp;c. Maym. <hi>ubi supr.</hi> per. 2.</p>
            <p>You may observe in these wretched traditions a twofold killing, and a twofold judgement: a mans killing another in his own person and with his own hand, and such a one liable to the judgement of the <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin,</hi> to be put to death by them as a murderer: And a man that kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led another by proxy; not with his own hand, but hiring another to kill him, or turning a beast or serpent upon him to kill him. This man not to be judged and executed by the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> but referred and reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved only to the judgement of God. So that from hence we see plainly, in what sense the word <hi>Iudgement</hi> is used in the later end of the preceding verse, and the first clause of this, namely not for the Judgement of any of the <hi>Sanhedrins,</hi> as it is commonly understood, but for <hi>the Iudgement of God.</hi> In the former verse <hi>Christ</hi> speaks their sense, and in the first clause of this, his own, in application to it. Ye have heard it said, that any man that kils is liable to the Judgement of God; But I say in you that he that is but angry with his brother without a cause, is liable to the Judgement of God. You have heard it said, That he only that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits murder with his own hand, is to be judged by the Councill or <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedrin</hi> as a murderer; But I say to you, that he that but cals his brother <hi>Racha,</hi> as common a word as ye make it, and a thing of nothing, he is liable to be judged by the <hi>Sanhedrin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, He that saith to his brother, <hi>Thou fool,</hi> wicked one, or cast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away, <hi>shall be in danger of hell fire.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. There are two observable things in the words. The first is the change of case from what was before: there it was said, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but here <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. And hereupon <hi>S. Petit</hi> in his <hi>variae Lectiones</hi> lib. 1. cap. 1. professeth that he cannot wonder enough, that Expositors should not observe this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation: and what he himself maketh of the observation of it I shall not insist upon, but referre the Reader to his own words. Surely he little mindes the <hi>Greek</hi> Text that sees not this in it, and there needs not any farre fetched Exposition to satisfie about it: It is but an Emphaticall raising of the sense, to make it the more feeling and to speak home: He that saith to his brother <hi>Raka</hi> shall be in danger of the Councill, but he that saies <hi>Thou fool,</hi> he shall be in danger of a penalty even to hell fire. And thus our Saviour doth equall the sin and penalty in a very just parallel. Injust anger, with Gods just anger and judgement: Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick reproach; with publick correction by the Councill: And censu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for a childe of hell, to the fire of hell. 2. It is no said <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>To the fire of hell,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>To a hell of fire:</hi> in which expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion he doth still set the Emphasis higher: And besides the reference to the <hi>valley of Hinnom,</hi> he seemeth to referre to that penalty used by the
<pb facs="tcp:59067:10"/>
               <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> of burning: the most bitter death that they used to put men unto: the manner of which was thus: <hi>They set the malefactor in a dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill up to the knees: and they put a towell about his neck, and one pul'd one way, and another another, till by thus strangling him they forced him to open his mouth. Then did they pour scalding lead into his mouth, which went down into his belly and so burnt his bowels.</hi> Talm. in Sanhed. per. 7. Now having spoken in the clause before of being judged by the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin,</hi> whose terriblest penalty was this burning, he doth in this clause raise the penalty higher, namely of burning, but in hell: not a little scal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding lead, but even with <hi>a Hell of fire,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The greatest part of the New Testament might be observed to speak in such reference to something or other commonly known, or used or spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken among the Jews, and even the difficultest passages in it might be brought to farre more facility then they be, if these references were well observed.

               </gap>re divers places where Commentators, not able to clear the sense for want of this, have been bold to say the Text is corrupt, and to frame a Text of their own heads; whereas the matter skilfully handled in this way, might have been made plain: As we have given experiment in this kinde in some as we have gone along, and divers others might have been instanced, but our work was not now to write a Comment.</p>

                  </gap>eering. The preceding; gave an intimation of <hi>Christs</hi> forerunner, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.6. and this begins to tell his story to the full.</p>
               <p>HEROD <hi>the Great,</hi> by descent an <hi>Edomite,</hi> and placed by the <hi>Romanes</hi> King of <hi>Iudea,</hi> [compare <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.40.] among divers other plagues, in his uneven, and rugged reign, had slain the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> Joseph. Ant. l. 14. c. 17. and to plaster the businesse again, by the counsell of <hi>Bava ben Bara</hi> repaired the Temple, and made it incomparably more sumptuous then it was before, <hi>Iucas. fol.</hi> 19. He began this work in the 18<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of his reign, and it cost him eight years to finish it, <hi>Ios. Ant. lib.</hi> 15. <hi>c.</hi> 14. So that this new fabrick was but eight or nine years old at this year that we are upon.</p>
               <p>In this Temple, <hi>Zacharias</hi> a Priest of the course of <hi>Abia,</hi> was offering incense in the holy place, as was used daily; and hath tidings brought him of a son, that should be forerunner to the <hi>Messias.</hi> Although <hi>Zacharias</hi> be said to have been <hi>of the course of Abia,</hi> yet can it hardly be thought that he was of his seed and posterity: for we finde mention but of four of the courses that returned out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>Abias</hi> was none of them, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2.36, 37, 38, 39. But the whole number of those Priests that did return of those four courses, being about 4290, were cast by lot into 24 courses, according to the Primitive institution, and <hi>Zacharias</hi> was of the eight, as <hi>Abias</hi> course had been before the captivity, and which yet bare his name, as the other did their names, who had denominated the courses from their first originall. Of this ordering of the courses after the captivity, both <hi>Talmuds</hi> speak largely, in the Treatise <hi>Taanith cap.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Whether <hi>Zacharias</hi> were of the seed of <hi>Abia</hi> or no, it is apparent by his serving in <hi>Abias</hi> course, that he was not high-Priest, but one of the ordinary Priests, that served by course as their turn came, and that had their particular imployment in the service, by lot. The manner of their lottery for this purpose, is mentioned at large in <hi>Tamid cap.</hi> 3. in <hi>Ioma cap.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>The Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> who about 456 years ago, had given account to <hi>Daniel</hi> of the time of <hi>Messias</hi> his sufferings, doth now when that time is drawing neer, first bring tidings of his forerunners birth, and then of his own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Ierusalem Gemara in Ioma fol.</hi> 42. <hi>col.</hi> 3. relates a story very parallel to this of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary,</hi> both of his seeing an Angel in the Temple, and of his stay there longer then was used at offering Incense. <hi>Simeon the just,</hi> say they, <hi>served</hi> Israel <hi>in the high-Priesthood four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years: And on the last year he saith unto them, This year I must die. They say to him, How knowest thou that? He answered. Every year hitherto, when I went into the most holy place</hi> [on the day of expiation] <hi>one like an old man cloathed in white, and vailed in white, went in with me, and came out with me. Now this year he went in with me, but came not out with me.</hi> And instantly after, <hi>The high-Priest might not stay praying in the most holy place long, lest he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:59067:11"/>
should put the people into a fear. One once staid long, and they were about to go in after him. Some say it was</hi> Simeon <hi>the Iust. They said to him, Why didst thou stay so long? He answered, I was praying for the Sanctuary of your God, that it should not be destroyed. They say to him, Though thou diddest so, yet shouldest thou not have stayed so long.</hi>

               <p>Five moneths were not the whole time of her retiring for that, that urged her to keep close so long, had the same tie upon her all the time she went with childe; but five moneths are only named, by way of introduction to the story, and occurrence in the sixth moneth mentioned instantly after.</p>
               <p>In the sixth moneth the same Angel appeareth to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and telleth her of the birth of the <hi>Messias,</hi> to be of her: which she beleeving, though by the course of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture so impossible, she presently goeth to her Cosen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> into the hill-countrey of <hi>Iudea</hi> [to <hi>Hebron,</hi> see <hi>Iosh.</hi> 21.11.] not only to visit her and to rejoyce with her, nor only to see the proof of those things that the Angel had told of her, but very probably, acted by the holy Ghost, that she might conceive the <hi>Messias</hi> in <hi>Hebron,</hi> where so many choice and eminent types of him, and references to him had been in ancient time.</p>
               <p>These tidings come to the Virgin at the very latter end of the year that we are upon, or the beginning of the next, and her journey to <hi>Hebron</hi> is in the middle of winter.</p>

Whose case and danger of death in that story, compare with the Virgins case and danger of divorce in this. The <hi>Talmudish</hi> Decretals do allot three moneths for such a discovery. <hi>Every woman</hi> [say they] <hi>that is divorced or become a widow, behold she may not be married, nor espoused, till she have stayed</hi> 90 <hi>daies, that it may be known whether she be with childe or no; and that there may be distinguishing betwixt the seed of the first husband, and the seed of the second.

LUKE maketh the coherence cleer, when he interposeth nothing betwixt the birth of the <hi>Baptist</hi> and the birth of <hi>Christ:</hi> and indeed there is nothing to be found in any of the Evangelists that can interpose.</p>
               <p>The four Monarchies which <hi>Daniel</hi> had told should be, and should expire, before the coming of <hi>Christ,</hi> have now run their course, and a fifth is risen far more potent and fully as cruell as all the four put together, and therefore it is pictured with the badges of all the four, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.2. compared with <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.4, 5, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A Decree of <hi>Augustus</hi> given out at <hi>Rome,</hi> becomes an occasion of accomplishing a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Lords, namely of the birth of the <hi>Messias</hi> at <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> He is born under a <hi>Roman</hi> taxation, and now that Prophesie of <hi>Chittim</hi> or <hi>Italy</hi> afflicting <hi>Heber,</hi> Numb. 24.24. beginneth livelily to take place.</p>
               <p>The time of his birth was in the moneth <hi>Tisri</hi> [which answereth to part of our <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>] and about the Feast of <hi>Tabernacles,</hi> as may be concluded upon by observing that he lived just <hi>two and thirty years old and an half,</hi> and died at <hi>Easter.</hi> That moneth was remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable for very many things. In it the World was created, the Tabernacle begun, and the Temple consecrated: and as the <hi>Ierusalem Gomarists</hi> well observe, <hi>In it were the Fathers</hi> [before the flood] <hi>born:</hi> In <hi>Resh hashavah fol.</hi> 56. <hi>cap. col.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>His birth was in the night, and attended with a Song of the whole quire of Angels [as <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. and compare <hi>Iob</hi> 38.7.] and with a glorious light about <hi>Bethlehem</hi> Shepheards, to whom this great Shepheard is first revealed.</p>
               <p>At eight dayes old he is Circumcised, and made a member of the Church of <hi>Israel:</hi> At fourty dayes old, he is presented in the Temple in the east gate of the Court of <hi>Israel,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the gate of Nicanor</hi>; and <hi>Maeries</hi> poverty is shewed by her Offering [compare <hi>ver.</hi> 24. with <hi>Lev.</hi> 12.6, 8,] yet her Childe is owned as <hi>the consolation and expectation of</hi> Israel.</p>
               <p>The first year of his age and infancy <hi>Christ</hi> spent at <hi>Bethlehem:</hi> for whereas the Lord by the Prophet had appointed his birth there, <hi>Mich,</hi> 5.2. his parents had no warrant for his

From two years old,</hi> because they had told him it was so long since the Starre appeared; And <hi>under two years old,</hi> because he would make sure work, as to that scruple that might arise, namely, whether the Star were a fore-runner, or a concomitant of the Birth of that King of the Jews that they spake of.</p>
               <p>Now that the Star appeared at the instant of his birth, cannot but be concluded upon this consideration, if there were no more, That otherwise it left the wise man so uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the time when he should be born, as that they could not tell whether he were born or no, no not when they were come to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The appearance of the Star therefore was on the night when he was born, and they having told <hi>Herod</hi> how long it was since it appeared, he accordingly slayeth all the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of two years old; for so old according to their information did he account the childe to be for whom he sought, and yet withall he slew all the children under that age, that he might be sure to hit and not fail of his design. This considered, it sheweth that <hi>Christ</hi> was in his second year at the wise mens coming, and withall it proveth the order of this Section to be proper, and that this Story is to be laid after the story of <hi>Maries</hi> Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and not before, as many have laid it.</p>
               <p>It may be objected indeed, that <hi>Luke</hi> having given the Story of his presenting in the Temple, concludeth, <hi>When they had performed all things according to the Law, they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Galilee:</hi> Now if they returned into <hi>Galilee</hi> when <hi>Christ</hi> was 40 daies old, how was he found at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> at two years old? <hi>Answ. Luke</hi> is to be understood in that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage according to the current of his own Story. He had nothing to say about this matter of the wise men, nor of Christs journey into <hi>Egypt</hi> [because <hi>Matthew</hi> had handled that to the full before] and the next thing that he hath to relate, is his coming out of <hi>Galilee</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> to one of the Festivals: having nothing therefore to insert between his presenting in the Temple at forty dayes old, and his coming again to the Temple at twelve years old, he maketh this brief transition between <hi>when they had performed all things ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Law they returned into Galilee,</hi> that he might thereby bring <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee,</hi> from whence he came when he shewed his wisedom at twelve years old.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Archelaus. </seg>10</label> IT is very easie to see the subsequence of this Section to that preceding: Since there is nothing recorded by any of the Evangelists concerning <hi>Christ</hi> from his infancy till he began to be thirty years old, but only this Story of his shewing his wisedom at twelve years old among the Doctors of some of the three <hi>Sanhedrins</hi> that sate at the Temple; for there sate one of 23. Judges in the East-gate of the Mountain of the house called the gate <hi>Shushan</hi>; Another of 23. in the gate of <hi>Nicanor,</hi> or the East-gate of the Court of <hi>Israel.</hi> And the great <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> of 71. Judges, that sate in the Room <hi>Gazith,</hi> not farre from the Altar.</p>
               <p>Though <hi>Herod</hi> had slain the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> as is related by <hi>Iosephus</hi> and divers others, yet was not that Court, nor the judiciary thereof utterly extinguisht, but revived again, and continued till many years after the destruction of the City.</p>
               <p>His Story about this matter is briefly thus given by the <hi>Babylon</hi> Talmud, in <hi>Bava Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:59067:13"/>
fol. 3. facic. 2. <hi>Herod was a servant of the Armenian Family; He set his eyes upon a girl of it. One day the man heard a voice from Heaven</hi> [Bath Kol] <hi>which said, Any servant that rebelleth this year shall prosper. He riseth up, and slayeth all his Musters: but left that girl,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And whereas it is said, Thou shalt set a King over thee from among thy brethren</hi> [which as the glosse there tells us, their Rabbies understood, <hi>of the chiefest of thy brethren] he rose up and slew all the great ones, only he left</hi> Baba ben Bora <hi>to take counsell of him.</hi> The glosse upon this again tells us: <hi>That he slew not utterly all the great ones, for he left</hi> Hillel <hi>and the sons of</hi> Betirah <hi>remaining:</hi> and <hi>Iosephus</hi> relateth also, that he spared <hi>Shammai:</hi> to which <hi>Abraham Zaccuth</hi> addeth, that <hi>Menahim</hi> and 80 gallant men of the chief of the Nation were gone over to his service and to attend upon him. So that these of themselves, and by ordination of others, did soon repair that breach that his sword had made in the <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> he not resisting its erection again, when he had now taken away the men of his displeasure.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hillel</hi> was president, and sate so fourty years, and died [by the Jews computation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Christian account] much about this twelfth year of <hi>Christ.</hi> For they say that <hi>he lived an hundred and twenty years, the last fourty of which he spent in the Presidency of the Sanhedrin, entring upon that dignity an hundred years before the destruction of the City.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Menahem</hi> was at first Vicepresident with him, but upon his going away to <hi>Herods</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>Shammai</hi> came in his room: and now two as eminent and Learned men sate in those two chairs, as ever had done since the first birth of traditions. <hi>Hillel</hi> himself was so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving a man, that whereas in the vacancy of the Presidentship, by the death of <hi>Shema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah</hi> and <hi>Abtalion, R. Iudah</hi> and <hi>R. Ieshua</hi> the sons of <hi>Betirah</hi> might have taken the chairs, they preferred <hi>Hillel</hi> as the worthier person, <hi>Talm. Ierus. in Pissachin. fol.</hi> 33. <hi>col.</hi> 1. He bred many eminent scholers, to the number of fourscore, the most renowned of which by name were, <hi>Ionathan ben Vzziel</hi> the Chaldee Paraphrast, and <hi>Rabban Iocanan ben Zaccai:</hi> both probably alive at this year of <hi>Christ,</hi> and a good while after. The latter was undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly so, for he lived to see the destruction of the City and Temple, and sate President in the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> at <hi>Iabneh</hi> afterwards. And till that time also lived the sons of <hi>Betirah</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Shammai</hi> was little inferiour to <hi>Hillel</hi> in learning or in breeding learned men: and their equall learning and schools, bred differences between them in point of learning, and determination about some things in their traditions. The two Masters controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting about a few Articles, but their Schollers about very many, and their differences ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high.</p>
               <p>This contention of the Schollers grew so very high even in the Masters time, that it is recorded that the Schollers of <hi>Shammai</hi> affronted and bandied against <hi>Hillel</hi> himself, in the Temple court. <hi>Ierus. in Iom. Tobh. fol.</hi> 61. <hi>col.</hi> 3. And the quarrellings of these Schools were so bitter, that as the same <hi>Talmud</hi> relateth, it came to effusion of blood and murdering one another, <hi>Shabb. fol.</hi> 3. <hi>col.</hi> 3. <hi>These are some of the Traditions that were made or setled in the Chamber of</hi> Hananiah <hi>the son of</hi> Ezekia, <hi>the son of</hi> Baron. <hi>The persons were numbred, and the Schollers of</hi> Shammai <hi>were more then the Schollers of</hi> Hillel. <hi>That day was a grievous day to</hi> Israel <hi>as was the day of the making of the golden Calfe. The Schollers of</hi> Shammai <hi>stood below and slew the Schollers of</hi> Hillel. Nor did these animosities cease, but they were ever crossing and jarring, till at the last the Schools of <hi>Hillel</hi> carried it, by the determination of a divine voice from Heaven, as was pretended [for to such fictions they glad to betake themselves.]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Till the divine voice</hi> [Bath Kol] <hi>came forth, it was lawfull for any one to practise accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the weighty or light things of the School of</hi> Shammai, <hi>or according to the weighty or light things of the School of</hi> Hillel. <hi>There came forth a divine voice at</hi> Jabneh <hi>and said, The words of the one and of the other are the words of the living God, but the certain determination of the thing is according to the School of</hi> Hillel. <hi>And whosever transgresseth against the words of the School of</hi> Hillel, <hi>deserveth death.</hi> Ibid. in Beracoth fol. 3. col. 2.</p>
               <p>At these times then that we are upon, their School-Learning was come to the very height, <hi>Hillel</hi> and <hi>Shammai</hi> having promoted it to a pitch incomparably transcendent above what it had been before; and accordingly now began the Titles of <hi>Rabban</hi> and <hi>Rabbi; Rabban Simeon</hi> the Son of <hi>Hillel</hi> being the first President of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> that bare a Title, for till these times their great and Learned men, had been called only by their bare proper names. So that now in a double seasonablenesse doth <hi>Christ</hi> the divine wisdome of God appear and set in among them, at twelve years old beginning, and all the
<pb facs="tcp:59067:14"/>
time of his Ministry after, going on to shew them wisdome fully, and his own Word and Doctrine the divine oracles of wisdome. In a double seasonablenesse I say, when their Learning was now come to the height, and when their Traditions had to the utmost made the word of God of no effect.</p>
               <p>This twelfth year of <hi>Christ,</hi> was the last year of the reign of <hi>Archelaus</hi> the Sonne of <hi>Herod,</hi> of whom is mention, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.22.

               <p>Now whereas it may seem strange, that upon <hi>Iohns</hi> beginning to baptize, he introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing so strange a practise and doctrine among them, yet the people should flock to him in so great multitudes, as the Evangelists shew they did, and receive his baptisme with so much readinesse: [besides that generall satisfaction that may be given to this, from the consideration of Gods speciall hand and work, providing entertainment for his Gospel, now setting forth,] these four things also may be pertinently observed.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This was the time that the Nation expected that the <hi>Messia</hi> should appear: See <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.11. <hi>Gabriels</hi> seventy in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. had so plainly and exactly pointed to this very time, that not only the pious and the studious among the Nation, could not but observe it, but it had even raised an expectation through a great part of the world, of some great Potencie to arise among the Jewish Nation about these times, which should subdue and be Ruler of all the world. <hi>Percrebuerat oriente toto vetus &amp; constans opinio, esse in fatis ut eo tempore Iudaea profecti rerum potirentur.</hi> Sueton. in Vesp. cap. 4. <hi>An old and a constant opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion had grown through the whole East, that some coming out of the East should be Master of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay so evident was the time and truth in <hi>Daniel,</hi> that the <hi>Ierusalem Gomarists</hi> that could be well content to deny that <hi>Messias</hi> was already come, as the rest of their Nation do, yet they cannot but confesse it in <hi>Beracoth. fol.</hi> 1. <hi>col.</hi> 1. in this story. <hi>Our Doctors say, the Name of King Messias is</hi> David: <hi>R. Ioshua ben Levi saith, His Name is The branch</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> [Zech. 3.8.] <hi>R. Iudah the son of R. Ibhu saith, his Name is Menahem,</hi> [the Comforter.] <hi>And this helps to prove that which R. Iudah saith, namely this example of a certain Iew: who as he was polwing, his Ox lowed: A certain Arabian passing by and observing his Ox low, said, O Iew, O Iew, loose thine Oxen, and lay by this plow, for behold your Sanctuary is destroyed. The Ox lowed a second time. He saith to him again, O Iew, O Iew, yoke thine Oxen, and tie on thy plow, for behold King Messias is born. He saith to him, What is his Name? the other answered Menahem</hi> [the Comforter:] <hi>And what is his Fathers Name? He answered, Hezekiah</hi> [the strong God.] <hi>He saith to him, Whence is he? He answered, From the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Palace of Bethlehem Iudáh. He went and sold his Oxen, and sold his plow and gears, and went about from City to City selling swadling clothes for babes. When he came to that City, all the women bought of him, but the Mother of Menahem bought not. He heard the voice of the women saying, O Mother of Menaham, thou Mother of Menahem, Bring some things sold here to thy childe. She answered, Now I pray, that all Israels enemies may be hanged, for on the day that he was born the house of the Sanctuary was destroyed. He saith to her, We hope
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:59067:15"/>
as it is destroyed at his feet, so it will be built at his feet. She saith to him, I have no money. And why, saith he, doth he suffer for that? If thou have no money now, I will come again after two dayes and receive it. After the dayes he came to the City and saith to her, How does the Childe? She answered him, Since the time that thou sawest me, there came windes and storms and took him out of my hands.</hi> A cleer confession of <hi>Christs</hi> being already come, and of the poverty of his Mother.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They expected a great change of things when <hi>Messias</hi> should come: That Promise in the Prophet of <hi>new Heavens and a new earth,</hi> to be created, raised this expectation. Hence have they this saying, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. <hi>A little one they bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize, by the appointment of the Consistory.</hi> And Maym. in Avadim. cap. 8. <hi>An Israelite that takes a little Heathen childe, or that findes an Heathen infant, and baptizeth him for a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selyte, behold he is a proselyte.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence a ready reason may be given, why there is so little mention of baptizing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants in the new Testament, that there is neither plain precept nor example for it, as some ordinarily plead: The reason is, because there needed no such mention, baptizing of Infants having been as ordinarily used in the Church of the Jews as ever it hath been in the Christian Church: It was enough to mention that <hi>Christ</hi> establisht baptism for an Ordinance under the Gospel; and then, who should be baptized, was well enough known, by the use of this Ordinance of old. Therefore it is good plea, <hi>Because there is no cleer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding of the baptizing of Infants in the Gospel,</hi> ergo <hi>they are to be baptized:</hi> for that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been in common use among the Jews, that Infants should be baptized as well as men and women, our Saviour would have given some speciall prohibition if he intended that they should have been excluded: so that silence in this case doth necessarily conclude ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation to have the practise continued which had been used of old before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohns</hi> baptism differed from that before, only in this; that whereas that admitted pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes to the Jewish religion, this admitted and translated Jews into the Gospel religion: that was a baptisme binding them over to the performance of the Law, as their Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion did, but this was <hi>a baptisme of repentance for the remission of sinnes,</hi> as was observed before.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Though some of the Nation expected that the <hi>Messias</hi> would come and redeem them, though they were impenitent, as some of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> plead in <hi>Talm. Bab. Sanhedr. cap.</hi> 10. <hi>&amp; R. Samuel in articulis fidei Iudaicae:</hi> yet was it more generally held and with good reason, that the <hi>Messias</hi> would look for a repenting generation: and thereupon others of the <hi>Gomarists</hi> in the place alledged say: <hi>If Israel repent but one day, presently the Messias cometh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the consideration of these things, it will appear the lesse strange, that the people flowed in to <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme in so great a conflux, this being the time about which the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion expected the appearing of <hi>Messias,</hi> baptisme being a thing most commonly known and used among them, and this baptisme of repentance administred preparatively toward the entertainment of <hi>Christ</hi> now ready to come, being sutable to their own apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the necessity of repentance, against his coming.</p>
               <p>Baptisme was [besides other tendencies of it] as a badge whereby those that received
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:59067:15"/>
it and stuck to it, were marked out for safety and preservation against that destruction that was to come upon the Nation for unbelief. Therefore <hi>Iohn</hi> construes their coming to be baptized, their <hi>fleeing from the wrath to come:</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> in the same sense, doth say, that <hi>baptisme doth now save,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.21. as the Ark had done in the destruction of the old world, so this from the destruction now coming. And <hi>Acts</hi> 2.40. to his admonition to <hi>Repent and be baptized,</hi> he addeth, <hi>Save your selves from this untoward genenation.</hi>

               <p>As our mother <hi>Eve</hi> was tempted by <hi>Satan</hi> to <hi>the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life,</hi> as 1 Joh. 2.16.

Forty dayes and forty nights [He being all the while, in watching, fasting and solitude, and among the wild beasts, but safe as <hi>Adam</hi> among them in innocency] the Devill tempteth him invisibly as he doth other men, namely striving to inject sinfull suggestions into him, but he could finde nothing in him to work upon, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 14.30. therefore at forty dayes end he taketh another course, and appeareth to him visibly in the shape of an Angel of light [and so had <hi>Eve</hi> been deceived by him, mistaking him for a good Angel] and trieth him by perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, by Scripture and by power, but in all is foiled, mastered and banished by sword.</p>

               <head>SECTION XIII. <hi>JOHN Chap. II.</hi> All the Chapter. Water turned into wine. CHRISTS first Passeover after his Baptisme.</head>
               <p>THe words, <hi>The third day</hi> in <hi>ver.</hi> 1. mean they, either the third day from <hi>Christs</hi> coming into <hi>Galilee,</hi> Joh. 1.43. or the third day from his conference with <hi>Nathanael,</hi> or the third day from the Disciples first following him, they give demonstration enough of the <hi>series,</hi> and connexion of this Chapter to the former.</p>
               <p>It was about the middle of our <hi>November</hi> when <hi>Christ</hi> came out of the wildernesse to <hi>Iohn</hi> at <hi>Bethabara,</hi> and then there were about four moneths to the Passeover, which time he spent in going up and down <hi>Galilee,</hi> and at last comes to his own home at <hi>Capernaum.</hi> Those two passages being laid together, <hi>The day following Iesus would go forth into Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee,</hi> Joh. 1.43. And <hi>After this he went down to Capernaum, and continued there not many dayes, and the Iews Passeover was at hand,</hi> Joh. 2.12. do make it evident that <hi>Iesus</hi> had now a perambulation of <hi>Galilee,</hi> which took up a good space of time. So that this first miracle of turning water into wine, was about the middle of our <hi>November,</hi> or little further.</p>
               <p>The Jews marriages were fixed to certain dayes of the week: <hi>For a virgin was to be married on the fourth day of the week, and a widow on the fifth,</hi> Talm. in chetub. cap. 1. [The reason why, is not pertinent to produce here.] Now if this marriage at <hi>Cana,</hi> were of a virgin, and on the fourth day of the week, or our <hi>wednesday,</hi> then <hi>Christs</hi> first shewing himself to <hi>Iohn</hi> and his Disciples at <hi>Iordan,</hi> was on the first day of the week, afterward the Christian Sabbath.</p>
               <p>These marriage feasts they held to be commanded, and thereupon they have this <hi>max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime, It is not fit for the Schollers of the wise to eat at feasts, but only at the feasts commanded, as those of espousals and of marriages,</hi> Maym. in Deah. cap. 5.</p>
               <p>At the Passeover, it is half a year since <hi>Christ</hi> was baptized: and thenceforward he hath three years to live, which <hi>Iohn</hi> reckoneth by three Passeovers more, <hi>viz. Ioh.</hi> 5.1. &amp; 6.4. &amp; 18.28. In this first half year he had gone through his forty dayes temptation, had ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered some Disciples, and had perambulated <hi>Galilee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At <hi>Ierusalem</hi> at the <hi>Passeover,</hi> in the face of all the people, he acted in the evidence of the <hi>great Prophet,</hi> and purgeth his own Temple, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1, 3. doth many miracles, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the false hearts of many, and trusteth not himself with them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He found in the Temple, those that sold Oxen and Sheep,</hi> ver. 14. For some illustration to this passage, take a story in <hi>Tal. Ierus. in Iom. tobh.</hi> fol. 61. col. 3. <hi>One day Baba ben Bota came into the Temple Court and found it solitary</hi> or destitute [that is, not having any beasts there for sacrifice.] <hi>He saith, Desolate be their houses who have desolated the house of our God. What did he? He sent and fetched in three thousand sheep of the sheep of Kedar, and searched them whether they were without blemish, and brought them into the mountain of the house</hi> [or the utmost court, the place where Christ found sheep and Oxen at this time] <hi>and saith, My brethren, the house of Israel, whosoever will bring a burnt-offering let him bring it, whosoever will bring a peace-offering let him bring it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59067:17"/>Among other things that <hi>Iesus</hi> did for the purging of his Temple, it is said, <hi>He powred out the changers money and overthrew the Tables.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and so again, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.12. Maym. in Shekalim. cap. 1. <hi>It is an affirmative precept of the Law, that every Israelite pay yearly half a shekel: yea even the poor, that lives on almes, is bound to this, either begging so much money that he may give it, or selling his coat to get so much.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Talm. in Shekalim. cap. 1, <hi>&amp;c. On the first day of the moneth Adar, proclamation was made about this half shekel, that they should get it ready. On the fifteenth day of that moneth, the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors sate in every City for the receiving of it; and as yet they forced none to pay. But on the five and twentieth day they began to sit in the Temple</hi> [this was some eighteen or nineteen dayes before the Passeover] <hi>and then they forced men to pay, and if any refused they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained. They sate with two Chests before them, into the one of which they put the money of the present year, and into the other the money that should have been paid the year before. Every one must have half a shekel to pay for himself. Therefore when he brought a shekel to change for two half shekels, he was to pay <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, some profit to the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And when a shekel was brought for two, there was a double profit to be paid for the change.</hi>

               <p>BEfore our Saviours departure from <hi>Ierusalem, Nicodemus</hi> one of the Judges of the great <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> cometh to him, and becometh his Disciple: for we cannot so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly look for a member of that great Council in any place as at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> He had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in his miracles, the dawning of the dayes of <hi>Messias,</hi> or <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> but having but grosse and erronious apprehensions concerning <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> or of the state of those dayes [as was the generall mistake of the Nation,] he is rectified about that matter, and is taught the great doctrines of regeneration and beleeving in <hi>Christ: Christ</hi> teaching regeneration by the spirit and Water, exalteth baptisme, and closely calleth to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> to be baptized. The <hi>Talmudish</hi> records make mention of a <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> in these times, who had to do about waters, to provide sufficient for the people to drink at the festivals.</p>
               <p>He is taught [against the great misprision of the Nation] that <hi>Messias</hi> should be a redeemer of the Gentiles as well as the Jews. The Jews in their common language, did title the Gentiles <gap reason="foreign">

Nicodemus</hi> very readily understood the word in this common sense, when Christ sayes, God so loved <hi>the world,</hi> that he gave his Sonne.

The Jerus.

No, saith our Saviour, God loved <hi>the world</hi> or the Gentiles, and God sent not his Sonne <hi>Messias</hi> to condemn <hi>the world</hi> or the Gentiles, but that <hi>the world</hi> through him should be saved.</p>
               <p>After this transaction with <hi>Nicodemus, Iesus</hi> departeth from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> into <hi>Iudea,</hi> and there he setteth his Disciples to baptize in his Name: that whereas <hi>Iohn</hi> had only bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in the Name of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his baptized ones did not know who <hi>Christ</hi> was, now the Disciples baptize in the Name of <hi>Iesus</hi> of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> to evidence him to be the <hi>Christ</hi> into whose Name <hi>Iohn</hi> had baptized.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iohn</hi> himself was baptizing still in <hi>Aenon</hi> in <hi>Galilee,</hi> having traversed <hi>Iudea</hi> upon the coasts of <hi>Iordan</hi>; and <hi>Peraea</hi> or beyond <hi>Iordan,</hi> and now come thither where presently his sunne is to set.</p>
               <p>This Chapter contains the story of half a year and somewhat more, namely from the Passeover [if the conference with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> were at that time] till after the feast of <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles:</hi> at which time it was a whole year since <hi>Christ</hi> was baptized, and a year and an half since <hi>Iohn</hi> began to baptize.</p>

               <p>FRom the last verse of the preceding Section and forward, we hear no more of <hi>Iohn</hi> in any of the four Evangelists, till you finde him in prison. Therefore this portion in <hi>Luke,</hi> which giveth the story of his imprisonment, is very fitly and properly to be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to what precedeth: observe how aptly the first verse of this and the last of that do joyn together. <hi>Luke</hi> indeed hath used an anticipation here, laying down the story of <hi>Iohns</hi> imprisonment, before the story of <hi>Christs</hi> being baptized, because he would shew the effects of <hi>Iohns</hi> doctrine altogether. With Pharisees, Sadduces, Publicans, Souldiers, and the rest of the people, he found entertainment of his doctrine when he told them their faults, and taught them their duty; but when he reproved <hi>Herod,</hi> he would not be so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant, but imprisoned him. The time of his commitment may be guessed, by what time it was that <hi>Christ</hi> slipped aside for his own safety upon the hearing how the case went with <hi>Iohn,</hi> which will appear to be about the middle of our <hi>November,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to preach and baptize at spring was twelve moneth before, about some eighteen or nineteen moneths ago.</p>

The <hi>Pharisees</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> would soon hear what was become of <hi>Iohn</hi> their eye-sore, and what <hi>Herod</hi> laid to his charge, namely the dangerousnesse of his gathering so many disciples. Now our Saviour understanding that they looked upon him, as one that had more Disciples then <hi>Iohn,</hi> and so was in equall danger from them upon that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, he getteth out of <hi>Iudea</hi> out of their reach and goeth to <hi>Galilee.</hi> But was not <hi>Galilee</hi> within their reach too?</p>
               <p>From <hi>ver.</hi> 35. may be computed the time of this journey into <hi>Galilee,</hi> namely when it was <hi>now four moneths to harvest</hi>; that is, to the Passeover, for from the second day in the Passeover week their Harvest began, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.11, &amp;c.

               <p>THus is CHRIST come up to <hi>Galilee</hi> again from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and out of <hi>Iudea</hi> where he had staid a good space. The Reader may observe here what a <hi>chasma</hi> [if I may so call it] there is in the story of <hi>Luke,</hi> who hath stepped from the story of <hi>Christs</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation in the wildernesse, to this his coming to <hi>Galilee,</hi> and hath laid nothing between, whereas there was a whole years history intercurrent; and so we observed such another <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.39.</p>
               <p>At his first coming up into <hi>Galilee</hi> in this voyage, he avoideth his own Town <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> because he knew a Prophet hath no honour in his own Country, but now having gone up and down the country some space, and a renown being gone of him all over those parts, he cometh at last to see what entertainment he can finde in his own Town. There he is admitted [as a member of that Synagogue] to be <hi>Maphtir,</hi> or publike reader of the second Lesson in the Prophets for that day. But preaching upon what he had read, and hinting the calling of the Gentiles, from the dealing of <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Elisha</hi> with some Heathens, and withall pinching close upon the wickednesse of <hi>Nazaret</hi> by that compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, he is in danger of his life, but delivers himself in some miraculous manner.</p>
               <p>He preacheth thus in the Synagogues, in the authority and demonstration of a Prophet, and as he evidenced that authority elsewhere by his miracles, so doth he here in <hi>Nazaret,</hi> by reading of the Lesson in the Prophet, which being to be read in the <hi>originall Hebrew,</hi> which Language was now lost among them and only attained to by study, he sheweth his Propheticall spirit in this skill in the language, having had no education to such a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. The reader in the Law and Prophets both, had an Interpreter, that rendred what was read out of the Hebrew text into the vulgar language, and the Interpreter sometime took liberty to paraphrase upon the Text [as the Chaldee Paraphrast had done, especially upon the Prophets,] and kept not alwayes <hi>verbatim</hi> to it. The <hi>Ierusalem Gomarists</hi> give an instance of such a thing, in Sanhedr. fol. 20. col. 3. <hi>Ioseph the Maonite interpreted in the Synagogue in Tiberias these words,</hi> Hear ye this all ye people, <hi>Why do not ye labour in the Law? have not I given the Sanhedrin to you for a gift?</hi> And hearken O house of <hi>Israel, Why do you not give the Sanhedrin the gift I appointed you at Sinai?</hi> And hearken O house of the King, for the judgement is to you; <hi>I speak it to you, but the judgement is to the Priests: I will come and sit with them in judgement, and end and destroy them out of this world.</hi> So <hi>Christ</hi> in reading the Lesson out of the Prophet, becomes his own Interpreter and Paraphrast both.</p>

               </head>
               <p>WHereas <hi>Matthew</hi> in the beginning of this Section, telleth that <hi>Christ</hi> left <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, Luke</hi> in the end of the preceding, shewes the reason why, namely because he was in hazard of his life there, and so the connexion is made plain.</p>
               <p>In the coasts of <hi>Zebulon</hi> and <hi>Nepthali</hi> captivity had first begun, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 15.29. and there <hi>Christ</hi> first beginneth, more publikely and evidently to preach the neer approach of <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> and redemption. In the first plantation of the Land after the captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Galilee</hi> escaped from being <hi>Samaritan,</hi> and was reserved for this happy priviledge, of being the first scene of <hi>Christs</hi> preaching the Gospel. And as that country was inhabited by a good part of the ten Tribes before their captity, so upon the return out of <hi>Babel</hi> in the times of <hi>Zorobabel</hi> and <hi>Ezra,</hi> it may well be held to have been planted with some of the ten Tribes again. For 1. Observe in <hi>Ezra</hi> 1. that there is a Proclamation from <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> that any of the blood of the Jews wheresoever within his dominions, should have
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:59067:18"/>
liberty to go up to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> ver. 3, 4, 5. Now undoudtedly the ten Tribes were then residing within his dominions, and it is harsh to conceive that they had all so far utterly forgot God and their country, as none of them to desire to go to their own Land again when permitted. 2. There is a <hi>summa totalis</hi> in <hi>Ezra</hi> 2. of fourty two thousand, three hundred and threescore, <hi>ver.</hi> 64. that returned out of captivity upon that Proclamation, and there are the number of severall families reckoned, as making up that summe: whereas if the totall of these particulars be summed up, it reacheth not, by sixteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sond or thereabout, to that number of fourty two thousand, three hundred and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score. Where then must we finde those sixteen thousand, since they arise not in the number of the families there named? The families there named are of <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> and then certainly those sixteen thousand can hardly be imagined any other then o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the ten Tribes. And 3. Whereas it is apparent that the returned of <hi>Iuda</hi> and <hi>Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> planted <hi>Iudaea,</hi> whom can we imagin, but some of the ten Tribes to have planted <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lilee?</hi> And hence their difference in language from the Jews of <hi>Iudaea,</hi> and in severall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms. And hence the reducing of some after the captivity, to the line of some of the ten Tribes: as <hi>Hannah</hi> to the Tribe of <hi>Asher,</hi> Luk. 2.36. <hi>Ben Cobisin of the line of Ahab.</hi> Talm. Jerus. in Taanith fol. 68. col. 1.</p>
               <p>And here is the first returning of the ten Tribes, to be supposed, and it carrieth fair probability, that the most of the twelve Apostles, and many of the rest of the Disciples that were of <hi>Christs</hi> most constant retinue, were of the progeny of some of the ten Tribes returned.</p>

                  <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew,</hi> &amp;c. called to be fishers of men.</head>
               <p>THe method and <hi>series</hi> is confirmed by the transition of <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark:</hi> but in the order of <hi>Luke</hi> there is some difficulty. 1. He relateth the calling of these Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples differently from the relation given by the other: for they say <hi>Christ</hi> called <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi> as he walked by the sea side, but he storieth their call when <hi>Christ</hi> was with them in the ship: they say he called <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> at some distance beyond <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew,</hi> but he carrieth it as if he called them all together. But this is not contrariety, but for the more illustration; they all speak the same truth, but one helps to explain another. The story at full in them all is thus: As <hi>Iesus</hi> walked by the sea of <hi>Genezareth,</hi> he saw two ships standing there, the one whereof belonged to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew,</hi> and the other to <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn.</hi> All these men, being partners, had been fishing all night, but had caught nothing, and were now stepped down out of their ships to wash their nets. <hi>Christ</hi> pressed with multitude on the shore, entreth into <hi>Peters</hi> ship and thence teacheth the people. And thence putting off a little into the main, he helpeth <hi>Peter</hi> to a miraculous draught of fishes, which was so unwieldy that he was glad to becken up <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> from the shore to come and help them. The draught of fishes was got up and boated, and then <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> return to the shore again, and fall to mending their net which was rent with helping at so great a draught. <hi>Peter</hi> seeing what was done, adoreth <hi>Christ,</hi> and he and <hi>Andrew</hi> being yet at sea, are called by him for fishers of men, and bringing their ship to shore, they leave all and follow him. <hi>Christ</hi> and they coasting a little further along the shore, came to <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and he calleth them. And thus lieth the story at the full.</p>
               <p n="2">2. A second scruple in the order of <hi>Luke</hi> is this, that he hath laid the two miracles of casting out a Devill in <hi>Capernaum</hi> Synagogue, and the healing of <hi>Petrs</hi> mother in law, before the calling of these Disciples, which apparently by this Evangelist were after. But the reason hereof may be conceived to be, especially this. In <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 30, 31. he had related that <hi>Iesus</hi> escaping from <hi>Nazaret,</hi> came down to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> and being now in the mention of his being there, he recordeth these two miracles that he did there [though not at that very time that he hath brought them in] having an eye in that his relation, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the place then to the time. And so we shall observe elsewhere, that the very men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a place, doth sometimes occasion these holy penmen, to produce stories out of their proper time, to affix them to that their proper place.</p>
               <p>These Disciples hitherto, were only as private men, following <hi>Christ,</hi> and here is the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:59067:19"/>
first time that they are but mentioned to the Ministeriall function, to be <hi>fishers of men:</hi> How then did they baptize before? <hi>Ioh.</hi> 3.22. with <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.2. And the starting of this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, calleth to remembrance that saying of the Apostle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel:</hi> Is baptisme administrable by private men, and is there any inconsistency betwixt baptizing and preaching? <hi>Answ.</hi> As baptism was in use among the Jewes for admission of proselytes under the Law, these two things were required to it, 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>He that was baptized must be baptized before three:</hi> 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>The thing required a consessus,</hi> or to be done by the allowing of some eldership. And <hi>because it required this</hi> [saith <hi>Maymony,</hi> whose words the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are also] <hi>therefore they baptized not on the Sabbath, nor on the holy dayes, nor in the night. A man that baptized himself, and proselyted himself, although it were before two witnesses; or that came and said, I was proselyted in such a mans consessus and they baptized me, he is not permitted to come into the Congregation, till he bring witnesse.</hi> Maym. in Issure. biah. par. 13. The reason of this strictnesse was, because of their strict nicenesse about conversing or matching with a Heathen, till they were sure he was fully Israelited.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christ</hi> and the Apostles in the administration of baptisme, followed or forsook their custom as they saw cause. In the case alledged, he followes it, he preacheth and calleth in Disciples, and they are baptized by these Disciples, but <hi>Christ</hi> chief in the action: and therefore one text tells us that he baptized, though we are taught by another text, that he baptized not. Now the Disciples are not to be looked upon as private men, since they were men of such privacy with the <hi>Messias,</hi> and not only converted by him, but called to be with him, and intended by him to be solemnly inducted into the ministeriall function when he should see time.</p>
               <p>And answerably in that saying of the Apostle, <hi>I came not to baptize, but to preach,</hi> he set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not an inconsistency between these two, which were joyned by <hi>Christ</hi> in <hi>Pauls</hi> and all Ministers Commission, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. but he speaketh according to this custome that we have mentioned, which the Apostles followed when disciples came in to be baptized, by multitudes, they themselves preaching and bringing in disciples to be baptized, and others baptizing them, and they not private men neither, but fellow-labourers with them in the Gospel, and Ministers of it.</p>

A Devill cast out in <hi>Capernaum</hi> Synagoge. <hi>Peters</hi> wives Mother and divers more healed.</head>
               <p>IF the transition of <hi>Mark</hi> from the preceding story to this, be observed, it cleereth the order: For having declared there how <hi>Christ</hi> had called his Disciples; <hi>And they,</hi> saith he, that is <hi>Christ</hi> and his new called Disciples <hi>went into</hi> Capernaum; his own City.</p>
               <p>There on the Sabbath day he casteth out a devill in the Synagogue, who by confessing <hi>Christ</hi> for the <hi>Messias,</hi> would have terrified the people with the dread of him, that they might not dare to entertain him. From the Synagogue they go to dinner to <hi>Peters</hi> house, and there he raiseth his wives Mother in law from a Feaver: And after Sun-set when the Sabbath was done, many more are brought to him and are healed. They began their Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath from Sun-set, and at the same time of the day they ended it. <hi>Talm. Hierosolm. in Sheviith. fol.</hi> 33. <hi>col.</hi> 1. And their manner of observing it, briefly was thus: for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of such a thing may be of some use, in some places of the Gospel as we go along, since there is so frequent mention there about their Sabbath.</p>
               <p>The Eve of the Sabbath, or the day before, was called <hi>the day of the preparation</hi> for the Sabbath, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23.54. and from the time of the evening sacrifice and forward, they began to fit themselves for the Sabbath, and to cease from their works, so as not to go to the barbor, not to sit in Judgment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nay not to eat thenceforward till the Sabbath came in. Nay thenceforward they would not set things on working, which being set awork would complete their businesse of themselves, unlesse it would be completed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sabbath came. As, <hi>they would not put Galls and Coperas to steep to make Ink, unlesse they would be steeped while it was yet day, before the evening of the Sabbath was entred. Nor
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:59067:19"/>
put wooll to dying, unlesse it would take colour whilest it was yet day: Nor put Flax into the oven, unlesse it would be dried whilest it was yet day,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Talm. in Sab. par.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>They washed their face, and hands, and feet in warm water, to make them neat against they met the Sabbath; and the ancient wise men used to gather their scholers together and to say, <hi>Come let us go meet King Sabbath,</hi> Maym. in Sab. par. 36.</p>
               <p>Towards Sun-setting, when the Sabbath was now approaching, they lighted up their Sabbath candle. <hi>Men and women were bound to have a candle lighted up in their houses on the Sabbath, though they were never so poor, nay though they were forced to go a begging for Oyl for this purpose: and the lighting up of this candle was a part of making the Sabbath a delight: and women were especially commanded to look to this businesse,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They accounted it a matter of speciall import and command, <hi>to hallow the Sabbath with some words,</hi> because it is said, <hi>Remember the Sabbath day to hallow it:</hi> and accordingly they used a two-fold action to this purpose, namely a solemn form of words in the way of hallowing it at its coming it, and this they called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Kiddush,</hi> and another solemn form of words in way of parting with it at its going forth, and this they called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Habdalah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The solemnity accompanying the hallowing of it at its coming in was thus. They spred and furnished the table with provision, and had the Sabbath candle burning by; and the master of the house took a cup of wine, and first rehearsed that portion of Scripture in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 3. and then blessed over the wine, and then pronounced the hallowing blessing of the Sabbath, and so drank off the wine, and the rest of the company drank after him, and so they washed their hands and fell to eat. This helps to understand those verses of <hi>Persius</hi> in Satyr. 5.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>—At cum</l>
                  <l>Haeredis venere dies, unct áque fenestris</l>
                  <l>Dispositae pinguem nebulam vomuere lucernae</l>
                  <l>Portantes violas, rubrumque amplexa catinum</l>
                  <l>Cauda natat thyuni, tumet alba fidelia vino:</l>
                  <l>Labra moves tacitus recutitaque Sabbata palles.</l>
               </q>
               <p>They used to eat their meals on the Sabbath, and thought they were bound to it in honour of the day, the first of which was this that they ate at the very entrance of it over night. Yea the poor that lived of alms were to eat three meals that day: and those that were of ability were to get choice provision, and alwayes better, at the least not the same that they used on the week dayes.</p>
               <p>The morning being come, and up, they went to morning prayer in the Synagogue, and when they had done there, they went home and ate their second meal: and when they had done that, they went to some <hi>Beth Midrash,</hi> or Divinity Lecture, and there spent the time till the afternoon was well come on; and then went home and ate their third meal, and so continued eating and drinking till the Sabbath went out.</p>
               <p>At the going out of the Sabbath, which was about Sun-setting, the master of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly again gave thanks over a cup of wine; then over his candle [for he set up a parting candle too,] and then over some spices which they used for the refreshing or reviving of any person that should faint for sorrow to part with the Sabbath [this is the reason they give themselves;] And then he pronounced the <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>separation blessing,</hi> by way of separating between the Sabbath that was now going out, and the working day that was coming in. And so he and the company drank off a cup of wine and fell to their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuals again.</p>
               <p>But to return again to our Evangelists. The retrograde course of <hi>Lukes</hi> method at this place, appeareth more conspicuous then before. For in the beginning of the fifth Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter he giveth the relation of the Disciples calling, and in the latter end of the fourth, this story of casting out the Devill in <hi>Capernaum</hi> Synagogue, which was after their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. Which he hath so placed, the rather [besides what was said upon this matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore] because in the last verse of that fourth Chapter, he speaketh of <hi>Christs</hi> preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all about in their Synagogues, and therefore beginneth the fifth Chapter with the story of the calling of the Disciples, that he might shew how <hi>Christ</hi> went attended with them in that perambulation. And in the same manner <hi>Matthew</hi> hath laid their call and that voyage close together for the very same intimation. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.22, 23. although other occurrences came between which he hath laid a great way off: As the story of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:59067:20"/>
                  <hi>Peters</hi> wives mother, which is brought in in this Section. He had said <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.23. <hi>That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> went about all the Synagogues of</hi> Galilee, <hi>teaching in their Synagogues and preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom, and healing all manner of sicknesse.</hi> He therefore beginneth first with his Doctrine, and layeth down the Sermon in the Mount, and then beginneth to speak of his Miracles at <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. and first giveth the story of healing a Leper, which was the first Miracle he wrought in that perambulation: and then the healing of the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions servant, which was the first Miracle he wrought after the Sermon in the Mount: and there being come into mention of one Miracle done in <hi>Capernaum,</hi> he also bringeth in another [though not done at the same time, but before] that he might dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch the works done in that place together. And thus the scope of his method is plain: and here again we see an example of what was said before, namely that the mention of a place doth oftentimes occasion these holy pen-men, to speak of stories out of their proper time, because they would take up the whole story of that place all at once or together.</p>

A Leper healed.</head>
               <p>MARK and <hi>Luke</hi> do assure the order: the reason why <hi>Matthew</hi> hath placed this story, as he hath done, hath been observed instantly before: which some not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken notice of, have supposed the story in <hi>Matthew,</hi> and in the other two Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists not to have been the same<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but conceive they speak of two severall Lepers healed at two severall times: whereas the words of the Leper, and the words and action of <hi>Christ</hi> in all the three, do assert it plainly for one story; and had the reason of <hi>Matthews</hi> dislo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it been observed, it would never have been apprehended otherwise.</p>
               <p>Lepers in <hi>Israel</hi> might not come into the Cities, till the Priests had pronounced them clean, and so restored them again to the Congregation: for the Priests could not heal, but only judge of the malady: and whom they pronounced clean, were not healed wholly of the disease, but were enlarged only from their separation: The leprosie conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued still, though they were absolved from their uncleannesse by the Priest [a very pregnant emblem of originall sinne,] but the danger of infection was over, and so they were restored again to humane society. If this Leper had not yet been under the Priests absolution, his faith, or his earnest desire of his recovery, or both, enforceth him to break those bounds that were set him, and he straineth courtesy to come to <hi>Christ</hi> in a City, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.12. If he were absolved by the Priests already from his uncleannesse, yet

seeketh he to <hi>Christ</hi> to make him clean from his disease, which the Priests could only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him clean from: the Priests could only pronounce him clean to the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <hi>Christ</hi> makes him clean to himself.</p>

For the cleering of which, let us first begin at the very conclusion of this Section, and make good the order there in the end, and that will illustrate the propriety of it here in the beginning: We have parted the story of the calling of <hi>Levi,</hi> from the story of the feast that he made for <hi>Christ</hi> after his call, although all the Evangelists that handle his story have laid them close together: The warrant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which we have parted them, although they be so neerly joyned in the text, is from these two things: 1. From undoubted evidence, by the current of the history, and the progresse of the Evangelists hitherto, which makes it plain, that <hi>Levies</hi> calling was at that time that we are now upon, or as it is laid in the end of this Section. 2. From this evidence, that his feast was not of a good while after his call, in that <hi>Matthew</hi> saith, <hi>while he was speaking,</hi> namely about fasting, and putting new cloth into an old garment, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> [which speech both the other Evangelists place at <hi>Levies</hi> feast or presently upon it:] <hi>Iairus</hi> came unto him. <hi>See</hi> Matth. 9.18. <hi>Mark</hi> 2.15, 18, 19. <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.29, 33, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now it is plain by the processe of the history of <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> that very many things, and a good space of time intercurred between the calling of <hi>Matthew</hi> or <hi>Levi,</hi> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Iairus:</hi> for <hi>Levies</hi> call is in <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.14. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.27. and the story of <hi>Iairus</hi> his coming is not till <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.22. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.41. Now in that these words that <hi>Christ</hi> was in speaking when <hi>Iairus</hi> came to him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.18. were spoken at <hi>Levies</hi> feast, <hi>Luk.</hi> 5.29, 33. it is apparent that his feast was a good space of time after his call: and hence have we warrant for the putting of those stories in the harmonizing of the Evangelists. The three indeed that speak of these stories do handle them together, because they would dispatch <hi>Levies</hi> story at once: and <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> do mention what occurred at his feet, but when they have done that, they return to the story and time, that properly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in order after his calling.</p>
               <p>Here therefore is the reason of <hi>Matthews</hi> so farre dislocating the story of the palsie man that is before us as he hath done: namely because in that ninth Chapter he pitcheth upon the time of <hi>Levies</hi> feast, and from that time goes on forward with the story suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding it: And so having pitched upon the time of his feast, he also brings in the story of his call, because he would take up his whole story in one place, as the other Evangelists have also done: and with the story of his call, he hath likewise brought in the story of the palsie man because it occurred at the same time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Matthew</hi> is not ashamed to proclaim the basenesse of his own profession before he was called, that that grace might be magnified that had called him. He was a Publican [and as it seemeth] at the Custom-house of <hi>Capernaum,</hi> to gather custom and tribute of those that passed over the water, or that had to deal on that sea of <hi>Galilee</hi> The <hi>Ierus.

                  </gap>: <hi>A Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risee</hi> [or one of the religion] <hi>that turns Publican, they turn him out of his order, but doth he leave his Publicanisme? they restore him to his order again:</hi> so unconsistent did they repute this profession and religion. <hi>Maym. in Gezelah. par.</hi> 5. <hi>Men of whom it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed that they are robbers, and of whom it may be presumed that all their wealth is gotten of rapine, because their trade is a trade of robbers, as Publicans and theeves, it is unlawfull to use their wealth,</hi> &amp;c. He becomes an Apostle and a penman of the Gospel: He wrote his Gospell first of all the four; and wrote it in <hi>Greek,</hi> though he wrote it more particularly for <hi>Hebrews:</hi> for the Hebrew tongue was so lost, that it was not ordinarily to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood; and the Greek Bible was the readiest in the hands of the unlearned, to examine the quotations from the old Testament, that he or any other of the divine Penmen should alledge: The Prophets had been but very lately before <hi>Matthews</hi> time turned into the <hi>Chaldee</hi> tongue by <hi>Ionathan ben Vzziel,</hi> and the Law by <hi>Onkeles</hi> a little after; and the

And in the reading of the Law and Prophets in the Synagogues, they had Interpreters that rendred it into the <hi>Syriack</hi> as was said a little before, because they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not the Originall; therefore it were unreasonable that <hi>Matthew</hi> should write in Hebrew, a Language then to the most unknown.</p>

               </head>
               <p>FOr the justifying and cleering of the order in this place, these things are to be taken into consideration. 1. That the first thing that the two Evangelists <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> who are most exact for order, have placed after the calling of <hi>Levi,</hi> is, the Disciples plucking the ears of Corn. They have indeed interserted <hi>Levies</hi> first, and <hi>Iohns</hi> disciples questioning about fasting, but that was more for the dispatching of <hi>Levies</hi> story altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, then for the propriety of their subsequence each to other, as hath been shewed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready. 2. In that the story of the Disciples plucking the ears of Corn, is joyned by them next, we are to look for a Passeover between, for till the Passeover was over, and the first-fruits sheaf offered the second day after, it was not lawfull to meddle with any Corn, to use, or to eat it, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.14. 3. <hi>Christ</hi> had said in the field of <hi>Sichem,</hi> that it was <hi>then four moneths to harvest,</hi> Joh. 4.35. that is, to the Passeover, at what time their Barley harvest began, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.11, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now, casting up the time from that place and speech, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up in the current of the story from thence hither, we cannot but conclude the four moneths to be now up, and this to be the Passeover, then thought upon in those words. And we may conceive that the Evangel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>st hath the rather omitted to call it by its proper name, or to speak it expresly, that this feast was the Passeover, because in that speech he had given fair intimation, how to understand the next <hi>feast of the Iews</hi> that he should speak of. He mentioneth indeed a Passeover in <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.4. but we shall finde by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gresse of the story in the other Evangelists, that that was yet so farre yet to come, that it cannot in the least wise be supposed to be that which was to come within four moneths after <hi>Christs</hi> being in the field of <hi>Sichem. The feast of the Iews</hi> therefore that he speaketh of in the first verse of this Chapter, must needs be that Passeover referred to <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.35. and this considered doth cleer the order.</p>
               <p>At this Passeover a man is healed at <hi>Bethesda,</hi> who had been diseased from seaven years before <hi>Christ</hi> was born. This was a pool first laid up by <hi>Solomon,</hi> as may be conjectured from <hi>Iosephus de Bel. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. compared with <hi>Nehem.</hi> 3. and at first called <hi>Solomons Pool,</hi> but now <hi>Bethesda,</hi> or <hi>the place of mercy</hi> from its beneficiall virtue. It was supplied with water from the fountain <hi>Sileam,</hi> which represented <hi>Davids</hi> and <hi>Christs</hi> Kingdom, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8 6.</p>

And this he doth so plainly, that he leaveth their unbelief henceforward without excuse.</p>
               <p>The Jews speak of divers ominous things that occurred fourty years before the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the City; As, <hi>It is a tradition that fourty years before the Sanctuary was destroyed the western Lamp went out, and the scarlet list kept its rednesse, and the Lords lot came up on the left hand.

occurred this year that we are upon.

The Disciples plucking ears of Corn. A withered hand healed on the Sabbath.</head>
               <p>THe words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which <hi>Luke</hi> hath used <hi>ver.</hi> 1. being rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, will help to cleer the order of this Section, and to confirm the order of the preceding.</p>
               <p>The Law enjoyned that the next morrow after the eating of the Passeover, should be kept holy like a Sabbath, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.16. and accordingly it is called a Sabbath, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.7, 11. And there the Law also enjoyns, that the next day after that Sabbaticall day, they shall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the sheaf of first-fruits to the Lord: and from that day they should count seaven Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths to <hi>Pentecost,</hi> which was their solemn festivall, and thanksgiving for that half harvest, <hi>viz.</hi> Barley harvest which they had then inned, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.15, 16, 17. That day therefore that they offered their first Barley sheaf, and from which they were to count the seaven Sabbaths or weeks forward, being the <hi>second day in the Passeover week,</hi> the Sabbaths that followed, did carry a memoriall of that day in their name till the seaven were run out: as the first was called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the first second-day Sabbath</hi>; The next <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the second second-day Sabbath:</hi> the next <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the third second-day Sabbath,</hi> and so the rest all the seaven through. Now let it be observed, 1. That no Corn, no not ears of Corn might be eaten till the first-fruits sheaf was offered and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before the Lord, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.14. 2. That it was waved <hi>the second day of the Passeover week.</hi> 3. That this was the first Sabbath after that second day, when the Disciples pluckt the ears of Corn, and it will plainly evince that we must look for a Passeover before this story, and so it will shew the warranty and justnesse of taking in the fifth of <hi>Iohn</hi> next before it.</p>
               <p>But the order of <hi>Matthew</hi> may breed some scruple, and that the rather, because that though he hath placed this story after divers occurrences that are yet to come, yet he hath prefaced it with this circumstance, <hi>At that time:</hi> Now this expression doth not alwayes center stories in the same point of time, but sometimes it hath made a transition betwixt two stories, whose times were at a good distance asunder: as <hi>Gen.</hi> 38.1. <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.8. and so likewise the phrase, <hi>In these dayes,</hi> Mat. 3.1.</p>
               <p>The latter story about healing the man with the withered hand, is so unanimously or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by all the three, after the other, that there is no doubt of the method of it.</p>
               <p>It was a speciall part of religion which the Jews used on the Sabbath, to eat good meat, and better then they did on the week dayes: yea they thought themselves bound to eat three meals on that day [as was said before,] and for this they alledge, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58.13. <hi>Nid. Kimch. ibid. &amp; Tamh. fol.</hi> 1. <hi>Talm. &amp; Maym. in Shab,</hi> &amp;c. compare <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19.</p>
               <p>Observe how farre the Disciples are from such an observance, and from such provision, when a few ears of Barley [for that was the Corn plucked] must make a dinner.</p>
               <p>The plucking of ears of Corn on the Sabbath was forbidden by their Canons <hi>verbatim.</hi> Talm. in Shab. par. 7. &amp; Maymon. Shab. par. 7, &amp; 8. <hi>He that reapeth Corn on the Sabbath, to the quantity of a fig, is guilty. And plucking Corn is as reaping: And whosoever plucketh up any thing from it growing, is guilty, under the notion of reaping.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Christ before his healing the withered hand, is questioned by them; <hi>Is it lawfull to heal on the Sabbath day?</hi> Their decretals allowed it in some cases. <hi>Tanch. fol.</hi> 9. <hi>col.</hi> 2. <hi>our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors teach the danger of life dispenseth with the Sabbath. And so doth Circumcision and the healing of that.</hi> But <hi>this is rule saith Rabbi Akibah, that that which may be done on the eve of the Sabbath, dispenseth not with the Sabbath.</hi> Talm. in Shabb. par. 19. Such was this case. Compare <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.14. They accounted that this might have been done any other day.</p>

The twelve Apostles chosen.</head>
               <p>LUKE and <hi>Mark</hi> do methodize and fix the time of the Sermon in the Mount; which <hi>Matthew</hi> hath laid very early in his Gospel, because he would first treat of <hi>Christs</hi> Doctrine, and then of his Miracles.</p>
               <p>In a mount neer <hi>Capernaum,</hi> he ordaineth a Ministry for the Church of the Gospel, and delivereth the doctrine of the Gospel, as <hi>Moses</hi> at <hi>Sinai</hi> had done the like for the Law. The number of the present Ministers appointed, whom he calleth <hi>Apostles,</hi> was twelve, agreeable to the twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel:</hi> that as they were the beginning of the Church of the Jews, so are these of the Gentiles: and to both these numbers of twelve joyned together, the number of the <hi>four and twenty Elders,</hi> the representative of the whole Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 4. &amp; 5, &amp;c. hath relation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.12, 14.</p>
               <p>The text allotteth these ends of their appointment: 1. <hi>That they might be with Christ,</hi> to see his glory, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.14. and to be witnesses of all things that he did, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.39, 41. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.48. 2. That he might send them forth to preach. 3. To heal diseases and cast out Devils.</p>
               <p>Before they were completed in all their divine endowments, they grew on by degrees; They were auditors a good while, and learning the doctrine of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, that they were to preach, before they set upon that work: for though <hi>Christ</hi> chose them now, yet it is well towards a twelve moneth, before he send them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad a preaching, as will appear in the processe of the story. So that besides the time that they had spent before this their choosing, they also spent that in hearing and learning from the mouth of their Master, what they were to teach when he should employ them: So that <hi>even the Apostles themselves at the first setting forth into the Ministry, did not preach by the Spirit, but what they had learned and gotten by hearing, study, conference and meditation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As the Lord under the Law, and from the first founding of that Church, did set apart a peculiar order and function of men for the service of the Sanctuary, so did he under the Gospel, a peculiar order and function for the Ministry of the Gospel; and this no more to be usurped upon, then that: Now as under the Law there were severall sorts of men within that function, as High-Priests, Chief-Priests, ordinary Priests and Levites, but all paled in with that peculiarity that no other might meddle with their function: so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise at the first rising of the Gospel, there were Apostles, Evangelists, Prophets, Pastors, Teachers, according to the necessity of those present times, but all hedged in with a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctive ministeriall calling, that none other might nor may break in upon. All the Titles and Names that Ministers are called by throughout the new Testament, are such as denote peculiarity and distinctivenesse of order; as, <hi>Wise men</hi> and <hi>Scribes,</hi> Mat. 23.34. Now the Jews knew not, nor ever had heard of <hi>Wise men</hi> and <hi>Scribes,</hi>

               <p n="2">2. He proceedeth laying out the latitude of the Law, according to its full extent and intention, and sheweth the wretchednesse of their traditionall glosses, that had made the Law of no effect. They understood the Law, <hi>Thou shalt not kill,</hi> only of actuall murder, and that, committed by a mans own hand; for <hi>if he hired another to kill him, or turned a wilde beast upon him, which slew him, this they accounted not murder for which to be questioned by the Sanhedrin,</hi> though it deserved the judgement of God, <hi>Talm. in Sanhedr. per.</hi> 9. <hi>Maym. in Rets<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They construed the command, <hi>Thou shalt not commit adultery,</hi> barely of the act of adultery, and that with another mans wife. <hi>Trip. targ. in marg. ad Exod.</hi> 20. but he tells, that it prohibits, lustfull thoughts and looks, and that looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a woman to lust after her, is adultery in heart. <hi>Rabban Simeon delighted to look upon fair women, that he might take occasion by the sight of their beauty, to blesse God.</hi> [A fair excuse.] <hi>Tal.

               <p>The Law had permitted divorces, only in case of fornication, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.1. but they had extended it to any cause, and to so loose an extent, that <hi>R. Ahibah</hi> said, <hi>A man may put away his wife, if he see another woman that pleaseth him better then she.</hi> Gittin par. 9. The Law had forbidden <hi>forswearing,</hi> or swearing falsly, thereupon they had made bold to take liberty of <hi>vain</hi> swearing at pleasure, so that, what they swore were not false; as see <hi>Tal. &amp; Maym. in Shevnoth.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. He prescribeth Christian duties, and especially rules of piety, charity and sincerity, and condemneth the hypocriticall vainglory of the Pharisees about these things. They used when they gave almes in the Synagogue, to have it openly proclaimed and publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what they gave, as if a Trumpet had been sounded for every one to take notice of their charity, <hi>Ierus. in Demai, fol.</hi> 23. <hi>col.</hi> 2.

They used to pray those prayers often, and often other prayers, in the Synagogue, apart and distinct from the prayers or service that the Synagogue was then upon, and so their particular devotion was the more subject to be observed, <hi>Ib. fol.</hi> 8. <hi>col.</hi> 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They used on their fasting dayes to use such a carriage and demeanour in face and garb, that all might observe that it was fasting day with them, <hi>Piske.

               <p>Throughout all this Sermon, this great oracle of divine truth, doth not only shew and hold out the sacred doctrines of faith, manners, duty and eternall life, but he evidenceth throughout, that he was throughly acquainted with all the learning, doctrines and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of those times. And to the explication of this divine Sermon, is required quick and ready versednesse in the Jews Records, for <hi>Christ</hi> hath an eyed and reference to their language, doctrines, customes, traditions an opinions almost in every line.</p>

               <p>LUKES transition, <hi>When he had ended all his sayings,</hi> doth prove the order. The four verses that speak about the Leper in <hi>Matthew,</hi> were taken up before, and their order spoken to then.</p>
               <p>A proselyte Captain that had so far affected the Jews religion that he had built a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue in <hi>Capernaum,</hi> having seen and heard the works and words of <hi>Christ,</hi> beleeveth him for the <hi>Messias,</hi> and beggeth of him the healing of his servant. Which that <hi>Christ</hi> could do, he concludeth from a comparison of the power of his own word and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand among his souldiers: for since they were ready to come, and go, or run at his command, much more doth he conclude, was the word of Christ of power to command away the disease of his servant if he pleased. Christ had often in his sermon on the Mount, asserted the authority of his own word, against and above the words of their traditiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and equalized it with that word that gave the Law. And here is a very high and seasonable confession of the authority of that word, made by this Centurion, and an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the power of it by the healing of his servant at distance. The mans faith is justly extolled though he were a Gentile, and the casting off the Jews is cleerly foretold, which Christ had not so plainly spoken out hitherto.</p>

They received a full answer to their question by the miracles they saw wrought, which abundantly proved that he was he that was to come. But as to their expectation of his miraculous enlargement of <hi>Iohn,</hi> his answer was, that his work was to preach the Gospel, and that it was a blessed thing not to take any offence at him, but to yeeld and submit to his wise dispensations. And accordingly when the messengers of <hi>Iohn</hi> were returned, he giveth a glorious testimony concerning him to the people, but yet sheweth how far one truly and fully acquainted and stated in the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> went beyond him in judging of it, who looked for temporall redemption by it.</p>
               <p>The Method of <hi>Matthew</hi> is somewhat difficult here, but he seemeth purposely to have joyned the mission of <hi>Christs</hi> Disciples and <hi>Iohns</hi> disciples together.

               </head>
               <p>THe continuation of this portion in <hi>Luke</hi> to that in Sect. 31. will plead for its order: and the reader will easily observe, that the interposition of the preceding Section in <hi>Matthew,</hi> is so farre from interrupting the story, that it is necessarily to be taken in there, and is an illustration of it. The actings of the two severall parties in this Section, the Pharisee that invited <hi>Christ</hi> to eat with him, and the woman sinner that comes and weeps at his feet for mercy, may seem to have had some rise from, or some occasionall refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the speech of <hi>Christ</hi> in the two Sections next preceding. In the former he had said, <hi>The sonne of man came eating and drinking,</hi> and this possibly might induce the Pharisee to his invitation: and in the latter he had said, <hi>Come unto me ye that are weary and heavy laden,</hi> and that might invite the woman to her addresse.</p>
               <p>This woman was <hi>Mary the sister of Lazarus, who was also called Mary Magdalen</hi>; of whom there is mention in the very beginning of the next Chapter. That she was <hi>Mary</hi> the sister of <hi>Lazarus, Iohn</hi> giveth us ground to assert, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.2. as we shall shew when we come there: where we shall evidence, that these words, <hi>It was that Mary which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed the Lord with oyntment, and wiped his feet with her hair,</hi> can properly be referred to no story but this before us: And that <hi>Mary the sister of Lazarus was called Mary Magdalen,</hi> we shall prove in the next Section: Christ in the story in <hi>Sect.</hi> 31. when <hi>Iohns</hi> disciples came to him we supposed to be at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and answerably it may be conceived that this passage occurred at <hi>Bethany,</hi> where <hi>Simon</hi> the Pharisee may not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probably be held to be the same with <hi>Simon the Leper,</hi> Matth. 26.6. where this very woman again annointed him.</p>

               <p>LUKE again is the warrant for the order. In the former story he had spoken of one woman that had found healing and mercy with <hi>Christ,</hi> and he speaks here of divers, and among them <hi>Mary Magdalen.</hi> Now that she was <hi>Mary the sister of Lazarus,</hi> let but these two arguments be weighed, not to insist upon more. The first is this: If <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> were not <hi>Mary</hi> the sister of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> then <hi>Mary</hi> the sister of <hi>Lazarus</hi> gave no attendance at <hi>Christs</hi> death, nor had any thing to do about his buriall [or at least is not mentioned as an agent at either] which is a thing so incredible to conceive, that it needs not much discourse to set forth the incredibility of it. There is mention of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> the mother of <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Salom,</hi> Mark. 15.40. and <hi>Ioanna,</hi> Luk. 24.10. but not a word of <hi>Mary the sister of Lazarus.</hi> She had twice annointed <hi>Christ</hi> in the compasse of that very week, she had ever been as neer and as zealous a woman disciple as any that followed him, and her residence was at <hi>Bethany</hi> hard by <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and what is now become of her in these two great occasions of attending upon <hi>Christs</hi> death and imbalming? Had she left <hi>Christ,</hi> and neglected her attendance on him, at this time above all others? or have the Evangelists, whilest they mention the other that attended, left her out? It is so unreasonable to beleeve either of these, that even necessity inforceth us to conclude, that when they name <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> they mean <hi>Mary the sister of Lazarus.</hi> And Secondly take this argument of <hi>Baronius,</hi> which hath more weight in it then at first sight it doth seem to have, who in his <hi>Annals ad Annum Christi</hi> 32, goes about to prove this thing that we assert, and he shews how it also was the opinion of the Fathers, and those in former times. His words are these: <hi>We say upon the testimony of</hi> John <hi>the Evangelist, nay of Christ himself, that it plainly appears, that</hi> Mary <hi>the sister of</hi> Lazarus, <hi>and</hi> Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len <hi>was but one and the same person. For when in</hi> Bethany <hi>the same sister of</hi> Lazarus <hi>annointed the feet of</hi> Jesus, <hi>and</hi> Judas <hi>did thereupon take offence,</hi> Jesus <hi>himself checking the boldnesse of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:59067:24"/>
the furious Disciple, said, Let her alone, that she may keep it against the day of my buriall: Now that she that brought the oyntment to the sepulcher for the annointing of the body of</hi> Jesus, <hi>was</hi> Mary Magdalen, <hi>is affirmed by</hi> Mark, <hi>and that she with</hi> Mary <hi>the mother of</hi> James <hi>and</hi> Salome <hi>did that office. When therefore neither in him, nor in any other of the Evangelists there is any mention of</hi> Mary <hi>the sister of</hi> Lazarus, <hi>who was foretold by our Saviour that she should do that office, it may easily be known that both these</hi> Maries <hi>were but one and the same.</hi> At <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.7. we shall shew that that speech must be construed to such a sense, as he hath put on it, save only that following the vulgar Latin, he reads <hi>sine ut servet,</hi> which indeed makes his sense the fuller, but though not so read, yet will that sense be full enough.</p>

               <p>THe <hi>series</hi> and consequence of this Section will require some cleering. 1. The reader here seeth that <hi>Mark</hi> hath nor mentioned any thing from the ordaining of the twelve Apostles unto this place: for the holy Ghost that held all their pens, did so dispose them, that sometimes one should speak the story, sometimes another, and sometimes more or all of them together. Now though the first clause of this Section in <hi>Mark, And they went into an house,</hi> be joyned so close to the Apostles ordaining, as if that were the next
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:59067:25"/>
thing done; yet the current of the story in the rest of the Evangelists, doth shew that it is not to be taken in, at that instant: and indeed the progresse of the story even in <hi>Mark</hi> himself, doth shew that this is the proper place of it, as will appear to him that shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely observe it. 2. <hi>Matthew</hi> hath laid this story of casting out a Devil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> next after two stories that occurred before the Sermon in the Mount, as hath appeared in its place: the reason of which may be supposed to be, because he would take up the exceptions of the Scribes and Pharisees together: That this story in <hi>Matthew</hi> lieth in juncture to these next succeeding will readily appear in them. 3. There is a story in <hi>Luk.</hi> 11. so like this, that one would think it were the very same; for there is mention of the same miracle, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting out a Devil, and the same cavill of the Pharisees, and the same answer to Christ: and yet the progresse of the history of <hi>Luke</hi> thither, and especially the coming off from that story, do perswade that it was another story. For <hi>Luke</hi> chaineth such following pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages to it, that cannot possibly be brought in concurrent with the current of these Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists now before us. And we shall observe hereafter, that Christ in his latter time did repeat over again very many of those things that he had spoken a good while before: as <hi>Moses</hi> his <hi>Deuteronomy</hi> was but a rehearsall of things that had been acted and spoken in his former time. The same devilishnesse was in the Scribes and Pharisees in all places, and it was accordingly to be met withall by Christ in more places then one: They had taken up a consent to beat down the dignity and authority of his miracles, by asserting that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he did, he did by the power of Magick, and this corrupt blood ran up in their veins every where wheresoever he met them, and therefore it is no wonder if the same words be in their mouthes here and there, when the same rotten principle was every where in their hearts. Observe how scornfully they require a sign from Heaven, when they had but newly seen a most heavenly sign.</p>
               <p>The word <hi>Beelzebul</hi> was taken up for the more detestation, as importing, <hi>The god of a dunghill,</hi> and the sacrificing to Idols they called <hi>dunging to an Idoll,</hi> R. Jose, ben R. Ben saith, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>He that seeth them dunging to an Idoll, must say, He that sacrificeth to other gods must be destroyed.</hi> Talm. Jerus. Baracoth, fol. 12. col. 2.</p>
               <p>What <hi>Christ</hi> speaketh about the unpardonablenesse of blasphemy against the holy Ghost, is in direct facing of their Tenet; which held, that blasphemy was attoned for by death though by nothing else. <hi>He</hi> [say they] <hi>by whom the name of Heaven is blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, repentance hath no power to save him from punishment, nor the day of expiation to attone for him, nor chastisements of the Iudges to acquit him. But repentance and the day of expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion attone for a third part, and chastisements a third part, and death a third part. And of such it is said, If this iniquity be purged till you die: Behold we learn that death acquitteth.</hi> Talm. Jerus. Sanhed. fol. 27. col. 3.</p>
               <p>The Jews defamed the miracles done by <hi>Christ</hi> as done by Magick, as appeareth not only by this and other places in the Gospel, but even in <hi>Talm. Bab. Schabb. fol.</hi> 104. <hi>col.</hi> 2. <hi>R. Eliezer said to the wise men, Did not</hi> Ben Sarda <hi>[this is a blasphemous name they give to Iesus of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>as was said a little before] bring inchantments out of</hi> Egypt <hi>in incisions in his flesh?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when they saw they were not able to contradict and decry the credit of the great miracles that he did, and they saw that this would not serve their turn, to say he did them by the power of the Devill; the Devill taught them to betake themselves to another shift clean contrary, and that was, to say and maintain, that when <hi>Messias</hi> came, he should do no miracles at all: which they assert in <hi>Sanhedr. per Helek. and Maym. in Melachim. per. ult.</hi>

The Parable of the Sower: and divers other Parables.</head>
               <p>MATTHEWS transition doth again cleer the order here. <hi>The same day went Iesus, &amp;c.</hi> The same day that his Mother and brethren came to him, as is apparent in the twelfth Chapter. So that this consideration helpeth to methodize the order of <hi>Luke:</hi> for whereas the other two have set the coming of <hi>Christs</hi> mother and brethren before his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of the Parable of the Sower, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he hath set it after; and that without contrariety though with diversity.

               <p>CHRISTS speaking of Parables, which he doth so exceeding much through the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, was according to the stile and manner of that Nation, which were exceedingly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed to this manner of Rhetorick.

               </head>
               <p>THe story of CHRISTS preparing to go over the water, is evidenced by <hi>Mark,</hi> to come in here in its proper place; for he saith, <hi>The same day at even,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matthews</hi> laying it where he hath done, may seem to be because of its neernesse to <hi>Matthews</hi> or <hi>Levies</hi> feast, as will appear in the following current of the story; which feast he hath laid at <hi>Matthews</hi> call, and so hath accordingly brought here divers stories together, though farre distinct in time; as some being neer the time of his call, some neer the time of his feast. But a greater scruple ariseth, namely, Whether this story in <hi>Matthew,</hi> of two that would follow <hi>Christ,</hi> and that in <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.57, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of three that would do so, be one and the same story, or two occurrences at severall times? It is well the matter is of no more chronologicall import, for it is hard to resolve which way to take it. The words of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:59067:26"/>
persons to <hi>Christ,</hi> and his answer to them, are so much the same, that it is hard to think two severall stories should run so parallel in all circumstances: And yet <hi>Lukes</hi> laying it so far out of its place, might perswade that it is not the same story. It would be more tiresome then profitable to dispute the matter at large; therefore to make sure and quick work, both the stories may be taken in at both places. I should rather hold them to be two sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries: In both of them where it is said, by those that should follow <hi>Christ, Let me first go and bury my father,</hi> It argues not that their father was dead or very sick; but that they thought themselves bound not to leave their father whilest he was living.</p>

               <p>It might be answered, as to this story, that it may be that these two that <hi>Matthew</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of were not alike furious, but that the impetuousnesse of the one was more then the other: and that <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> speak of him only that was in the worse case. Or for ought that <hi>Matthews</hi> Greek prohibiteth, the two might be understood for man and wife, whom the two other Evangelists treat of as one person. But by the other examples ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, where <hi>Matthew</hi> speaking of two, <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> speak but of one, it is plain and satisfactory, that these two latter, writing after <hi>Matthew,</hi> and he having given the story before them, numbring the persons concerned in it, they have not been curious so much to specifie the number of persons on whom the miracles were wrought, which he had done before, as carefull to record the miracle done, that none of Christs workings might be left unrecorded, as to the nature of the thing done.</p>
               <p>The Evangelists describe the condition of these poor possessed ones, much in the same colours that the Jews do him that they call <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>It is of some scrupulousnesse to cast, how so many swine should be in those parts, since swines flesh was such an abomination among the Jews, and those that kept and bred swine little lesse abominated. <hi>Their wise men said, Cursed be he that brings up dogs and swine,</hi> Maymon. in Niz. Mammon per. 5.

Shekalim fol. 47. col. 3. But even <hi>Pliny</hi> may help us to an Answer and resolution in this doubt, who tells us how rare dainties swines flesh is accounted of by the <hi>Romans, Neque alio ex animali numerosior materia ganiae,: quinqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginta prope sapores, cum caeteris singuli.

Why <hi>Levies,</hi> or <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thews</hi> Call and Feast are set together by all the Evangelists that speak of them, we have observed before, namely because they would dispatch the whole story of that man at once or alltogether: And that his call was at the place where we have laid it, the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the story thither confirmeth past deniall.

A bloody issue healed: <hi>Jairus daughter raised.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>MATTHEW assures the order, for he saith, <hi>While Iesus was speaking:</hi> those things that are recorded in the preceding Section, concerning Fasting, and not put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting new wine into old bottles, <hi>&amp;c. Iairus</hi> came to him to beg the recovery of his now dying daughter.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Iairus</hi> was one of the Rulers of <hi>Capernaum</hi> Synagogue, and had seen so many miracles done by <hi>Christ</hi> there, that if he were not a Disciple already, yet he beleeves that <hi>Christ</hi> can easily recover her, though when he came away from her she was giving up the ghost. As <hi>Iesus</hi> goeth with him in <hi>Capernaum</hi> streets, a woman with a bloody issue of twelve years continuance cometh behind him and toucheth him: Her disease and <hi>Iairus</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were born in one and the same year, for they were both twelve years old, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 42, 43.</p>
               <p>The malady of this woman was not only of a sad languishing, but it was also of a great uncleannesse, according to the uncleannesse mentioned in the Law. The Talmudich trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise <hi>Zavim,</hi> and <hi>Maymony in Issurei biah,</hi> cap. 4.5, 6. would read a dolefull Lecture upon her disease, as to this point of uncleannesse. And this it may be was one main cause that made the woman to come trembling and fearing to <hi>Christ</hi> when she saw she could not be hid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.33. because she had been so bold as to touch <hi>Christ</hi> in her uncleannesse.</p>
               <p>The story of the Pictures of <hi>Christ</hi> and this woman touching him, both made in brasse
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:59067:27"/>
of which the Papists have made no small ado towards their worshipping of Images] hath spoken exceeding wide and far from hitting upon the right place where this woman and <hi>Christ</hi> met. The story as it is related by <hi>Eusebius, Baronius,</hi> and others, is this. <hi>That in</hi> Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saria Philippi <hi>called otherwise</hi> Paneas, <hi>the house of this woman was to be seen: and before the door of the house, a brazen Image of a woman kneeling, and before her the brazen statue of a man, in a garment down to the feet, and stretching out his hand to the woman: And that there grew there a certain strange herbe, which when it grew up to touch the brazen hemme of his garment, it had the medicinall virtue of healing any disease.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But why all this at <hi>Caesaria Philippi?</hi> whereas this occurrence of the womans healing by the touch of the hemme of his garment was in <hi>Capernaum:</hi> for <hi>Matthew</hi> tells, that when <hi>Iesus</hi> came back out of the Country of the <hi>Gadarens, he came into his own City,</hi> Matth. 9.1. which was <hi>Capernaum:</hi> and there was <hi>Matthews</hi> house, in which he was when <hi>Iairus</hi> came to him. <hi>See</hi> Sect. 23.</p>
               <p>Before he comes to <hi>Iairus</hi> his house, his daughter is dead, and there he findes minstrels and piping in a mournfull tone, for the bewailing of her. This was the custom of the Jews in such cases, as is to be seen in <hi>Talm. Ierus. in Beracoth. fol.</hi> 5. <hi>col.</hi> 4. <hi>Maymony in</hi>

               <p>A good while ago he had denounced a sad doom against <hi>Capernaum,</hi> Matth. 11.23. at Sect. 32. <hi>O thou Capernaum which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be brought down to hell,</hi> &amp;c. which was spoken as to the generality of the City, who for the things they had heard and seen, as that being <hi>Christs</hi> own City, or the place of his habitation, yet they beleeved not. And this may be some reason, why when he had raised this dead girle, he bids her parents keep the matter close: for that City had justly forfeited all such revelations of him: Yet for all the denouncing of that sad fate against her, he oft resorteth thither, and forsaketh not his habitation there; partly because he had some there, who for all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief of the generality, belonged to him, and beleeved in him; and partly because he had no reason to remove his habitation for their unbelief, nor to passe off his dwelling for other mens wickednesse; for where could he go to reside, but he should reside among some of the same temper?</p>

The twelve Apostles sent out to preach.</head>
               <p>THe order in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> shews and cleers it self.</p>
               <p>The twelve had been ordained for Apostles a great while since, and all that while, had been with <hi>Christ</hi> as probationers, to see his works and to learn his Doctrine: and since their pointing out to be Apostles it is observable, how much <hi>Christ</hi> hath applied himself to Doctrine, that they might learn the Gospel of the Kingdom, and be stored with what to preach, when he should send them forth. Hitherto they had been learners, and as for the gifts of the Spirit they as yet differed nothing from the rest that followed him, but now he gives them power of healing and casting out devils, [and now is the power of miracles restored.] So that they cured diseases by the Spirit, but they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not by the Spirit, but taught that only which they had learned from the mouth of <hi>Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He sendeth them out <hi>by two and two,</hi> and so it is like the twelve spies divided themselves when they went to search the Land. It may be the Apostles went in these couples that <hi>Matthew</hi> had reckoned them in.</p>
               <p>What <hi>Christ</hi> forbiddeth them to take with them for their journey, was 1. to inure them to depend upon his protection and not upon their own carefulnesse: And 2. He hereby intimates that they should finde such good entertainment in their Ministry, that they should finde safety and maintenance wheresoever they came. Therefore when in <hi>Luke</hi> 22.6. <hi>Now take purse and scrip,</hi> &amp;c. he thereby would not signifie that his care of them was any whit abated of what it was now, but that they should meet with worse times and worse entertainment then they had had now.</p>
               <p>Whereas in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> they are forbidden to take staves, in <hi>Mark</hi> it is said, <hi>they should take nothing for their journey save a staff only:</hi> not staves for weapons or for their defence, but a staff for their resting on for their ease in the journey: as <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10.</p>
               <p>They are confined to preach to <hi>Israel</hi> only, [though many Gentiles dwelt intermix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly with them in their Cities] because the Lord would own the peculiarity of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the first preaching of the Gospel, as he had done all along in the Oeconomy of the Law: when they had forfeited their priviledge of being a peculiar people, by crucifying him that sent the Gospel amongst them, then is the Apostles commission inlarged to go to the Gentiles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.</p>

               <p>MARK and <hi>Luke</hi> do justifie the order, for both of them have laid this story next to the story of <hi>Christs</hi> sending forth his Disciples. <hi>Matthew</hi> when he saith <hi>At that time,</hi> he useth the word in its latitude, as it is often used in Scripture, not precisely or determinately for the very day or season when a thing was done, but in the current of time then in being. And yet in this expression he seemeth also to have respect to the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that he had related next before, though that were some reasonable space of time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this: For there he had told that <hi>Christ</hi> coming into his own Country, was sleighted and undervalued, and they were offended in him, yet <hi>Herod</hi> was amazed at the wonders that he heard of him.</p>
               <p>Here are two times regardable in this Section, namely the time of <hi>Iohn Baptists</hi> death, and the time of <hi>Herods</hi> hearing of the fame of <hi>Iesus</hi>: And the juncture of the stories is very close. As the Disciples were preaching up and down according to <hi>Christs</hi> mission, <hi>Herod</hi> beheaded the Baptist: and by their preaching in the name of <hi>Iesus,</hi> the fame of <hi>Iesus</hi> cometh to <hi>Herods</hi> hearing; and the Disciples again hearing of the murder of <hi>Iohn,</hi> get in to their master. So that the story of <hi>Iohns</hi> death, is related here in the proper place and time when it did occurre. And from one passage of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangelist in the next following Section, there is the ground of a fair conjecture of the time of his beheading: For we shall see in the beginning of the next Section, that all the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>our do speak of <hi>Christ</hi> departing privately into a desert place: <hi>Matthew</hi> particularly gives the reason, namely because he had newly heard, by <hi>Iohns</hi> Disciples, of the death of their Master. Now <hi>Iohn</hi> the Evangelist in giving that story of <hi>Christs</hi> retiring, hath inserted this passage, <hi>And the Iews Passeover was nigh,</hi> whereby we may conclude that the <hi>Baptists</hi> death was a little before the time of the Passeover. And from hence we may take up the whole space of his Ministry and imprisonment. He began to Preach and Baptize in the year of Christ 29, at the spring of that year or about <hi>Easter.</hi> Half a year after <hi>Iesus</hi> is baptized by him, about the Feast of <hi>Tabernacles.</hi> Till after the Feast of Tabernacles come twelve moneth, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Year of <hi>Christ</hi> 30, he is still abroad baptizing in <hi>Bethabara</hi> and <hi>Aenon:</hi> About <hi>October</hi> in that Year he is imprisoned, and so lieth in restraint till almost <hi>Easter</hi> twelve moneth, which was in the Year of Christ 32. And so his story is of three years space, the better half of which he preached at liberty, and the other half he lay in prison.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herod</hi> upon the hearing of the fame of <hi>Iesus,</hi> is struck with horrour of conscience upon thought of the murder of <hi>Iohn:</hi> and if the <hi>leaven of Herod</hi> was <hi>Sadduceism,</hi> his horrour makes him deny his <hi>Sadducaicall</hi> principles, and to think that <hi>Iohn</hi> was Risen from the dead.</p>

Five thousand fed miraculously: Christ walketh on the Sea.</head>
               <p>ALl the four speak the same story of <hi>Christs</hi> miraculous feeding many thousands in a Desert: <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Matthew</hi> do plainly link this story to the preceding, as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous to the eye of whosoever shall view in them the last verse of the foregoing Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the first of this.</p>

                  <hi>Iohns</hi> Disciples with the tidings of their Masters death, and <hi>Iesus</hi> Disciples from their Preaching abroad, came in to <hi>Iesus</hi> much about the same time: and it may be <hi>Iohns</hi> Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples cleave to him and depart no more from him.

                  <hi>Iohn</hi> in this story hath made mention of the Passeover neer at hand, <hi>vers.</hi> 4. because he only of all the four hath undertaken to give account of all the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>overs, betwixt <hi>Christs</hi> Baptism and his death,<note place="margin">

               <head>SECTION XLVIII. <hi>JOHN Chap. VI.</hi> from <hi>Ver. 22.</hi> to the end of the Chapter. Iesus teacheth in Capernaum Synagogue, concerning eating his flesh, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>THe first words in the Section, <hi>The day following,</hi> asserts the order.</p>
               <p>Divers of those that had been fed by <hi>Christ</hi> miraculously in the Desert of <hi>Bethsaida,</hi> remained upon that ground all night, expecting <hi>Iesus</hi> to come again among them, who was departed away from them, but, as they saw, not with his Disciples; therefore they the next morning follow him to <hi>Capernaum,</hi> and there finde him. It was Synagogue day there, namely either the second or fifth day of the week, and in the Synagogue <hi>Christ</hi> speaketh of eating his flesh and drinking his blood, which seemeth a Doctrine so mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous to many, that divers that had followed him, do now depart from him.</p>
               <p>What would these people have? They had been fed miraculously yesterday, and yet to day they say to him, <hi>What sign shewest thou that we may see and beleeve?</hi> ver. 30. <hi>Our fathers did eat manna in the desert,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 31. They looked for a continued miraculous feeding as <hi>Moses</hi> fed <hi>Israel</hi> with <hi>Manna</hi> in the wildernesse: and to that the words of <hi>Christ</hi> referre, <hi>ver.</hi> 26. <hi>Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye ate of the loaves.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is said, <hi>When they had seen the miracle that Iesus did, they said, This is of a truth the Prophet that should come into the world, and they went about to make him King,</hi> ver. 14, 15. They thought they saw in this miracle the sign of the <hi>Messias</hi> they looked for, who should feed his people miraculously as <hi>Moses</hi> had done, and therefore when they now require a sign to be still shewed in that nature, <hi>Christ</hi> tels them they must expect no other food to be provided for them by him, then his own flesh and blood: which sounds so coldly in some of their ears, that they will follow him no more.</p>

               <head>SECTION XLIX. JOHN Chap. VII. Ver. 1. After these things Iesus walked in Galilee, for he would not walk in Iury, because the Iews sought to kill him.</head>
               <p>BEtween the time of this Section and that preceding, we are to imagine the Passeover to have passed, of which there is mention, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.4. So that after this passage in <hi>Capernaum</hi> Synagogue, <hi>Christ</hi> goeth up to the Passeover at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and there <hi>the Iews,</hi> that is the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> sought to kill him. At the Passeover the last year they convented him before them, to answer for his violation of the Sabbath in healing the man at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thesda,</hi> Joh. 5. and he plainly affirms and proves himself to be the <hi>Messias,</hi> and he comes off with safety, but after what manner is not expressed.</p>
               <p>But now the increase of his Disciples, the spreading of his fame and Doctrine by the preaching of the twelve, and it may be the example of the murdering of <hi>the Baptist,</hi> had so stirred them up to seek his life, that he perceiving it, gets away from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> into <hi>Galilee,</hi> and will not yet come into <hi>Iudea</hi> again.</p>

               <p>Certain Scribes and Pharisees that were sent purposely from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> [as may be conjectured, because the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> there fought to destroy <hi>Iesus</hi>] seeking to intrap and oppose him, and to make a party against him, quarrell his Disciples for not wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before meat.

               <p>How they prized this and other traditions of the Elders above the Word of God, and so by and for them made that of no weight, may be read too numerously in them, in such like blasphemous passages as these: <hi>The words of the Scribes are more lovely then the words of the Law, and more weighty then the words of the Prophets.</hi>

               <p>Our Saviour damning these cursed Traditions, doth instance only in that unnaturall tenet of theirs, that extinguisheth all filiall assistance to needy Parents: as if a son said to his father or mother, <hi>It is Corban,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>His resolving the case about meats not defiling the man, overthrew a great part of <hi>Pharisaism:</hi> for this washing before meat was meerly out of their Traditions, and it was a great part of their sanctimony. <hi>Moses</hi> indeed had forbidden divers things as unclean

So that the Ordination of one to that Function which was more properly Ministeriall, or to teach the people their duty, as what was lawfull, what not, what they were to do, and what not to do, was to such a purpose, or in such a tenour as this, <hi>Take thou power to binde and loose, or to teach what is bound and loose,</hi> for they use both the expressions <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>By this vulgar and onely sense of this phrase in the nation, the meaning of <hi>Christ</hi> using it thus to his Disciples, is easily understood; namely that he first doth instate them in a Ministeriall capacity to teach, what bound and loose, what to be done and what not, and this as Ministers, and thus all Ministers successively to the end of the world. But as they were Apostles of that singular and unparalleled order, as the like never in the Church again, he gives them power <hi>to binde and loose</hi> in a degree above all Ministers that were to follow: namely, that whereas some part of <hi>Moses</hi> Law was now to stand in practise, and some to be laid aside, some things under the Law prohibited, were now to be permitted, and some things then permitted, to be now prohibited, he promiseth the Apostles such assistance of his Spirit, and giveth them such power, that what they allowed to stand in practise should stand, and what to fall should fall: what they <hi>bound in earth should be bound in heaven,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

A Prophet,</hi> that is, a succession of Prophets till <hi>the great Prophet</hi> should come who should seal Vision and Prophesie.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christ</hi> had been sealed for <hi>the great Priest</hi> at his Baptisme, when entring into his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry at the same age that the Priests entered into their Office, he is attested from heaven, <hi>This is my wellbeloved Son in whom I am well pleased.</hi> He is sealed for <hi>the great Prophet</hi> here, by the like attestation from heaven, with the same words, <hi>This is my wellbeloved Son in whom I am well pleased,</hi> but withall it is added <hi>Hear him,</hi> answerable to those words, <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever will not hearken,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> the first Prophet had all his Oracles out of a Cloud: and the Cloud of Glory that lead <hi>Israel</hi> in the Wildernesse, departed at his death: think of that when you see a cloud here overshadowing and a Divine Oracle given out of it, at the sealing of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet greater then he.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> was the first Prophet of the Jews, and <hi>Elias</hi> the first Prophet of the Gentiles, and they both now appear to attend their Master. <hi>Christ</hi> and the three Disciples were in this mount of his Transfiguration all night: for <hi>Luke</hi> saith, <hi>It came to passe the next day when they were come down,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 37. Compare Christ transfigured and his face shining with the shining of <hi>Moses</hi> his face, and so compare that first Prophet and this great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet again together.</p>
               <p>The Disciples that had authority and power given them over all devils, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.1. are not able here to cast one out: and their Master sheweth a double reason why, namely, because of their unbelief, and because that kinde went not out but by Fasting and Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Now, that their unbelief should be any more then it had been before [for they had cast out devils before this, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.13.] it might seem strange, but that here were some concurrents towards that, more then they had met with before now: and that we may observe especially in these two things: 1. There were divers diseases, which in their own nature, were but naturall diseases, which yet the Jews did commonly repute as seizure and possessing by the devil, especially those that distempered the minde, or did in more speciall manner convulse the body: and according to this common language and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the Nation, the language of the Gospel doth speak exceeding frequently: Examples of this kinde of Dialect among the Jews we might produce divers: as that in <hi>Maym. in Gerushin.</hi> per. 2. <hi>A man which is troubled with an evil spirit, and saith when the sicknesse [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>] begins upon him, Write a bill of Divorcement to my wife, he saith as good as nothing, because he is not</hi> compos sui: <hi>And so likewise, a drunken man, when he comes neer the drunkennesse of</hi> Lot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He calls this evil spirit [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or] a sicknesse, and by it he means Lunacy or Distractednesse that had its <hi>lucida intervalla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So the Jews speak of a man <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>that is possessed by Cordicus:</hi> which they interpret to be <hi>a spirit that seizeth on him that drinketh too much wine out of the winepresse. Talm in Gittin. per.</hi> 7. <hi>Vid. R. Sol.</hi> and <hi>Nissim ibi.</hi> And to spare more, because the story in hand is of a child, take but this example of an evil spirit which they conceived did seize upon children: <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Shibta,</hi> say they, <hi>is an evil spirit that seizeth upon children by the neck, even upon the sinews behinde the neck, and drieth them up from their use and strength till it kill him. And the time of it is from the childes being two moneths old, and the danger of it is till the childe be seven years old.</hi> Aruch. in <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> Which seemeth to mean no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else but Convulsion fits or shrinking of sinews, or some such like thing, a naturall malady.</p>
               <p>Now in this childe there were not only these fits of Convulsions or the Falling sickness and the like, but he was really possessed with the devil indeed. So that though the Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples had healed severall persons of maladies, which the Jews in their language and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions called possessings with evil spirits, and the Evangelists speak their language, yet this is a subject to work upon of a further difficulty by far, the devil being bodily in this childe indeed. 2. Granting [for we dare not deny] that they had cast out devils in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed before, yet this case carried some extraordinary matter in it above other times. They were then preaching up and down, and their Commission gave them power to cast out devils to confirm their Doctrine, but now they were not in that imployment. They were also now set upon by the Scribes and Pharisees, with a possessed person of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:59067:31"/>
example, as being possessed from an Infant, purposely that they might puzzle them, and that in the fairer opportunity, when their Master and three of the chief of their company, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> were absent. Therefore if by all these concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of disadvantage, their faith were somewhat shaken, it is to be the lesse wondered at, by how much the more the case was more strange and unusuall to them, and they had not been put to such a triall before.</p>

                  </gap> shekel that every <hi>Israelite</hi> paid yearly, went to the repair of the Temple, and to the buying of things needfull for the service there; <hi>Christ paies his Church Duties,</hi> therefore here, though, as his own words argue, he being the Son of the great King for whom that Tribute was demanded, might have pleaded immunity: for Kings take Tribute of strangers, not of their own children. His paying it by a miraculous compassing of it out of a fishes mouth, sheweth at once his Divine power that could make all things serve his ends, and his great care to discharge his due paiments and to avoid offence; and withall, his poverty, when he is put to a Miracle for such a little summe of money, for he would not work Miracles where there was not need. His paying for <hi>Peter</hi> with him, was because he was of the same Town, and so was under the same demand of payment, and he knew that he was in the same want of money.

A dispute who greatest: One casting out Devils, and yet not following Christ: <hi>Dic Ecclesiae,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
               <p>THe order needeth no demonstration: The seeming difference between <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> in the beginning of the Section needeth animadversion rather: <hi>Mark</hi> saith their dispute who should be greatest, was as they went in the way towards <hi>Caperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> and when <hi>Christ</hi> asked them at <hi>Aapernaum</hi> what their discourse had been, they held their peace. But <hi>Matthew</hi> saith, <hi>At the same time,</hi> namely while <hi>Christ</hi> was at <hi>Caper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naum,</hi> the Disciples came to him and asked him, <hi>Who is the greatest,</hi> &amp;c. in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation he briefly coucheth the two stories that <hi>Mark</hi> speaketh of into one, namely, their talking by the way who should be greatest, and this question coming before <hi>Christ.</hi>

               <p>It may be <hi>Christs</hi> so lately taking <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> into the mount apart from the rest, gave occasion to this debate, which he determineth by setting a childe in the middest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> They that have held this childe to have been <hi>Ignatius</hi> in his infancy, who was afterward the Martyr, [as see <hi>Nicoph. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 3. <hi>Baron. ad Annum Christi</hi> 71. <hi>Marg. de la Bign. in Ignat. in Biblioth.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:59067:31"/>
but I saw him in the flesh after his resurrection.</hi> For so the Latine renders it, <hi>Vidi cum in carne:</hi> or be it, <hi>I knew him in the flesh after his resurrection,</hi> it may seem very strange, that he that was so very a childe as Christ to take him in his arms this year al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most at the feast of Tabernacles, and the next year at <hi>Easter,</hi> which was but within half a years space, to become so intelligent as to take notice of his being risen.</p>
               <p>Upon Christs speaking of receiving those that come in his name, <hi>Iohn</hi> propounds a dubious case, of one that they had met with that went about indeed in his Name, and in his Name cast out devils, and yet would not own himself his Disciple, nor follow him: which raiseth to us a further scruple, How this man came to this miraculous power? for that it was so, and not Magicall exorcizing in the Name of Jesus, as divers enemies of the Gospel used afterward, may be gathered by Christs answer, who cals it doing a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle in his Name, and speaks of this man as not being against him but for him. Whether he did these Miracles in the Name of <hi>Messias</hi> or of <hi>Iesus</hi> we will not question: the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of this power to him, we may resolve much into the same principle from whence <hi>Caiaphas</hi> prophesied, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.51. <hi>This he spake, not of himself, but being Highpriest that year he prophecied:</hi> There is an emphasis in <hi>That year:</hi> For now was the fulnesse of time, the year of expectation, and accomplishment of Vision and Prophesie, and the time of the powring out of the Spirit as never before: and if in that full meal of this provision that Christ had made for his own, some crums fell besides the table that others gathered up, or were partakers of, it doth the more magnifie the diffusion, and doth so much the more point out and give notice to observe the time. For Christ did so little leave himself without witnesse, and did give so clear evidence that this was the great and signall time spoken of by the Prophets in all generations, that Miracles wrought not only by himself and his Disciples, but even by the Jews own children, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.27. give abundant testimony to it.</p>

               <p>The number of a hundred divided into <hi>ninety nine and one, ver.</hi> 12. is according to the usuall and ordinary manner of the Jews speech, with whom this very division is very common.</p>
               <p>Talm. in Peah. per. 4. halac. 1. &amp; 2. <hi>When a man is dividing nuts among the poor, though ninety nine call on him to divide them, and one call on him to scatter them, to him they must hearken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> With grapes and dates it is not so, though ninety nine call on him to scatter them, and one to divide them, to him they must hearken,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Jerus. in Shab. fol. 14. col. 3. <hi>Rabh, and R. Chaiish Rabbah, both of them said, If ninety nine dye by an evil eye, and one by the hand of heaven. R. Chaninah and Samuel both of them said, If ninety nine die by cold and one by the hand of heaven,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The rules that <hi>Christ</hi> giveth about dealing with an offending brother, were very well known in the Nation, and such as were practised, at least prescribed in their own Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scipline.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Admonition privately</hi> betwixt the party offended and the party offending. Of such <hi>Maymony</hi> speaks in his Treatise Deah. <hi>per.</hi> 6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Admonition, two witnesses being present.</hi> Jerus. in Joma fol. 45. col. 3. <hi>He that sinneth against his fellow, it is necessary that he say unto him, I have offended against thee. If he receive him, well: If not, he must bring two men and appease him before them,</hi> &amp;c. Only <hi>Christ</hi> rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his lesson to a higher charity, namely for the offended party to try the amendment of the offending. So the jealous husband admonisht his wife before two. <hi>Setah. per.</hi> 1. and the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> by two Scholars of the wife admonished an <hi>Israelitish</hi> City that fell to Idolatry, before they made warre upon it. <hi>Maym. in Avedah Zarah. per.</hi> 4.</p>

               <p>THat this journey of <hi>Christ</hi> toward <hi>Ierusalem</hi> that <hi>Luke</hi> speaketh of in this Section, is the same with this in <hi>Iohn,</hi> namely his going up to the <hi>Feast of Tabernacles,</hi> is plain by this, that <hi>Luke</hi> mentioneth two journeys of his to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> more; namely in <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.22. which was to the <hi>Feast of Dedication,</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.11. which was to the Passeover and his Passion.</p>
               <p>The words of <hi>Luke</hi> then, <hi>When the time was come that he should be received up, he sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly set his face to go to Hierusalem,</hi> mean, that now being come within half a year of the time of his death, he resolved to be more constant at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> then he had been; having avoided the place and country, once and again, because the Jews sought to kill him.</p>

               <p>AS to the order of this story, First, It is to be observed, that <hi>Luke</hi> saith, It was <hi>after these things</hi> mentioned in the former Section; that is, after <hi>Christ</hi> was set out from <hi>Galilee</hi> towards the feast of Tabernacles. Secondly, that it is said <hi>Ioh.</hi> 7.10. <hi>That Iesus went up to that Feast, not openly, but as it were in secret,</hi> whereupon it may be concluded, that he had dispatched the seventy Disciples away before he came there. He giveth them the same instructions that he had given the twelve, and the same power to heal the sick: only whereas the twelve went at large to any of the Cities of <hi>Israel,</hi> these were to go to those places where <hi>Christ</hi> himself should come, to make way for him, and to prepare the places for the receiving of him against he came: so that now <hi>Christ</hi> disposeth for the full reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of himself for the <hi>Messias,</hi> the Seventy beforehand proclaiming him and preaching in his Name, and he afterward coming and shewing himself to be he of whom they preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The numbers 12, and 70, cannot but recall to minde the twelve Tribes and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Elders of <hi>Israel.</hi> These Seventy were but a little while abroad [for thirty five couples would soon dispatch a great deal of work:] and they return again to their

Master before he departs from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Luk. 10.17, 38.</p>
               <p>He again accuseth <hi>Chorazin, Bethsaida</hi> and <hi>Capernaum,</hi> which he had done before at <hi>Sect.</hi> 32. for having at any time occasion to speak of contempt of the Gospel, they may justly be introduced as having the most tender of it, and yet despised it.</p>

               <p>THe pregnancy of the order here, speaks it self: In the two preceding Sections, <hi>Iesus</hi> was in the way up to the Feast, and now he is come there.</p>
               <p>Now is the year of the World 3960, and the year of <hi>Christ</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 33 begun: both entring in this very moneth in which the Feast of Tabernacles was. The great year of the world, the fullnesse of time, the year of redemption and powring down of the Spirit. It was indeed the year of Jubilee, however the Jews would jumble their account [as see <hi>Maymon. in Shemittah veiobel. per.</hi> 10.] whether ignorantly or wilfully let them look to it. For count from the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of the rule of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> when the warres of <hi>Canaan</hi> ended, and Jubilees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and you have 1400 years to this present year that we are upon, just eight and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Jubilees: this year the last that <hi>Israel</hi> must ever see. It is the confession of <hi>Zohar</hi> in <hi>Lev.</hi> 25. <hi>that the Divine glory should be freedom and redemption in a year of Iubilee.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the sending out of the seventy Disciples neer upon the very instant when this Jubilee began, with the sounding of the Trumpet for the proclaiming of the Jubilee, <hi>Lev.</hi> 25.9. and there is a fair equity and unanswerablenesse to that type, in that very thing.</p>
               <p>From this Feast of Tabernacles to the Passeover at which time <hi>Christ</hi> suffered, was that last half year, of the last half seven mentioned <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. which compare with the last half year of <hi>Israels</hi> being in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in which time <hi>Moses</hi> did his miracles, and which ended also at the Passeover.</p>
               <p>Among the many varieties of solemnity and festivity used at the Feast of Tabernacles, of which we have given account at large in another volume, there was the powring out of water fetched out of the fountain <hi>Siloam,</hi> with the wine of the drink-offering, and at night their most transportant joyfulnesse, expressed by their singing, dancing and the like jocund gestures, for that powring out of water: which by some, <hi>in Ierus. succah, fol.</hi> 55. <hi>col.</hi> 1. is interpreted to signifie <hi>the powring out of the holy Ghost:</hi> The consideration of this illustrates <hi>ver.</hi> 37, 38. where it is said, that <hi>on the last and great day of the Feast, Iesus cried, If any thirst,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>He that beleeveth on me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of water,</hi> &amp;c. Upon which words many beleeved him, because they had seen already so fair evidence of the gifts of the Spirit, in the powerfull works of himself and his Disciples: and yet the text saith here, <hi>The holy Ghost was not yet given, because Iesus was not yet glorified:</hi> a far greater gift of that being yet behind.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> would fain have been medling with him to have tried him for a false Prophet, as may be gathered from their words <hi>ver.</hi> 52. but his hour was not yet come.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>IT is said in the conclusion of the former Chapter, that <hi>every one</hi> [of the <hi>Sanhedrin] went home,</hi> and here, <hi>Iesus went into the mount of Olives:</hi> which joyns the story plain enough. Not that he lodged in mount <hi>Olivet</hi> in the open fields, but that he went to <hi>Bethany,</hi> and lodged in the house of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> of which we shall finde confirmation in the next Section.</p>
                  <p>In the morning he comes to the Temple, and in the treasury, or the Court of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, he sitteth down, and teacheth the people: For it was the custom for the Teachers of the people to sit when they taught, and those that were taught to stand about them.

The

snare that they laid for him in this matter, was various. That he should condemn the adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teresse, but where was the adulterer? why brought they not him too? If he condemned her, he seemed to assume Judiciall power: if he condemned her not, he seemed a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Law. But he in his divine wisdom used such a mean, as condemned their base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and confounded their machination against him. His writing with his finger upon the ground, may rather be construed from allusion to <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.23. or from <hi>Ier.</hi> 17.13. or from a passage in <hi>Tal. Ierus. in Megillah. fol.</hi> 74. <hi>col.</hi> 2. or from severall other illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then for that action toughly and rudely to deny the authenticknesse of the story. The censuring and judging of this woman, belonged to a Judiciall bench at the least of twenty three Judges, and it would have carried a fair accusation against him, had he gone about to judge in such a matter. The woman was espoused and not yet married, as see <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.24. for their Judicials punished him that lay with an espoused maid, with <hi>sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Sanhedr. per.</hi> 7 <hi>halac.</hi> 4. but him that lay with a married wife, with <hi>strangling, Ibid. per.</hi> 11. <hi>halac.</hi> 1.</p>

               <p>THe observing of the beginning and end of this Section, will cleer the subsequence of this to the preceding, and the order of all the stories comprehended in it. It begins with the seventy Disciples returning from the imployment upon which their Master had sent them. Now that they returned to him at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> whither he was gone to the Feast of Tabernacles, appears by this, that after they are come up to him, he is in <hi>Bethany</hi> in the house of <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha,</hi> Luk. 10.38, 39.</p>
               <p>The Section ends with this relation, <hi>And he went through the Cities and villages teaching and journeying towards Ierusalem,</hi> Luk. 13.22. So that in <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.17. he is at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> having come thither to the <hi>Feast of Tabernacles,</hi> And in <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.22. He hath been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad and is now travelling up to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> again to <hi>the Feast of Dedication.</hi> Therefore this whole Section is the story of his actions from the one Feast to the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> X. Upon the Disciples relating that the Devils were subject to them in his Name, he answers, <hi>I saw Satan fall from heaven like lightening.</hi> Which referreth partly to his death shortly to be, by which <hi>Satan</hi> was overthrown, and partly [if <hi>Heaven</hi> mean the Church of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and the state of Religion there as it means not seldome] to the power of the Gospel this very year and forward, among them, casting him out. With these words of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the consideration of the time they refer to, we may fitly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare severall places which give and receive light mutually with it: As <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.45. where <hi>Satan</hi> cast out of this nation returns again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.9. &amp; <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>Unto a Lawyer <hi>Christ</hi> defineth who is <hi>a Neighbour,</hi> by the Parable of the wounded man and the good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> vastly differing from the doctrine of the Pharisees in that case. Take these two or three assertions of their own Schools for some illustration of this Parable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. They accounted none under the terme <hi>Brother,</hi> but an Israelite by blood, and none under the terme <hi>Neighbour,</hi> but those that were come in to their Religion. <hi>Aruch in voce <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. By using the word Neighbour are excluded all the Heathen.</hi> Maym. in Retseah per. 2. <hi>An Israelite that slayeth a stranger sojourning among them, is not to be put to death by the Sanhedrin for it, because it is said, If a man come presumptuously upon his Neighbour:</hi> By which it is apparent they accounted not such a one <hi>a Neighbour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. They have this bloody and desperate tenet: <hi>Hereticks, that is, Israelites that follow Idolatry, or such as commit provoking transgressions, as to eat a carcasse, or to wear linsey-woolsey for provocation, this is an Heretick. And Epicureans, which are such Israelites as
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:59067:33"/>
deny the Law and Prophets, it is commanded that a man kill them if he have power in his hand to kill them; and he may boldly kill them with the sword: but if he cannot, he shall subtilly come about them till he can compasse their death. As if he see one of them fallen into a well, and there was a ladder in the well before, let him take it up and say, I must needs use it to fetch my sonne from the top of the house, and then I will bring it thee again. But Heathens betwixt whom and us there is not warre, as also the feeders of small cattell of</hi> Israel, <hi>and such like, we may not compasse their death; but it is forbidden to deliver them, if they be in danger of death.</hi> [Observe this] <hi>As if one see one of them fall into the Sea, he shall not fetch him up, for it is said, Thou shalt not stand up against the blood of thy Neighbour. But such a one is not thy Neighbour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Of all other people of the world they abhorred <hi>Samaritans,</hi> as appeareth by <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.9 &amp; 8.43. and by exceeding many expressions to that purpose in their own writings: and therefore our Saviour urging for cleer and free charity in this Parable, exemplifieth in a <hi>Samaritan</hi> the unlikeliest man in the world to do any charitable office for a Jew: and he <hi>a neighbour,</hi> though so remo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Christ</hi> is at <hi>Bethany,</hi> ver. 30. in the house of <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha.

               <p>
                  <hi>Chap.</hi> XI. ver. 2. The Lords prayer rehearsed: <hi>Christ</hi> had taught it, almost a year and a half ago, in his Sermon in the mount, and now being desired to teach them to pray, he gives the same again. They that deny this for a form of prayer to be used, either know not, or consider not, what kind of prayers the eminent men among the Jews taught them: <hi>Iohn</hi> had taught his to pray, after the same manner and use of the nation; and <hi>Christ</hi> being desired to teach his Disciples as <hi>Iohn</hi> had taught his, rehearseth this form which he had given before. They that again deny this Prayer is to be used by any but reall Saints, because, as they say, none but such can call God <hi>Our father</hi>; either know not or consider not, how usuall this compellation was among the nation in their devotions, and <hi>Christ</hi> speaketh constantly according to the common and most usuall language of the country.</p>
               <p>At <hi>ver.</hi> 14. and forward, there is a story of casting out a Devil, so like that in <hi>Sect.</hi> 35. the Jews cavill, and our Saviours words about it are the very same: and yet the current of the history evinceth them for two severall stories: for as the Jews alwayes carried the same malicious construction of his miracles, so doth he justly alwayes return them the same answer, as hath been observed already.</p>

               <p>Maladies of children that were extraordinary, the Jews did very much ascribe to some sinne of the parents: and the traditionaries used this conceit as a means to awe men to the observance of their traditions.

               <p>The man upon whom the miracle is wrought taketh Jesus to be a Prophet upon it, but as yet doth not know him for <hi>Messias.</hi> ver. 17.

                  <hi>It was at Ierusalem the feast of the Dedication,</hi> ver. 22. <hi>Vnder the second Temple when the Grecian Kings decreed decrees against</hi> Israel, <hi>and abolished their Law, and suffered them not to practise the Law and Commandments, and laid their hands upon their goods and upon their daughters, and went into the Temple and made breaches in it, and defiled the pure things, and</hi> Israel <hi>was in exceeding great straits because of them, and they afflicted them with great affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, until the Lord God of their fathers had pitty on them, and delivered them out of their hand: and the Asmenian high Priests prevailed against them, and slew them, and delivered</hi> Israel <hi>out of their hands: and set up a King of the Priests, and the Kingdom returned to</hi> Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael <hi>more then two hundred years, even to the second destruction: And when</hi> Israel <hi>prevailed against their enemies and slew them, it was the five and twentieth day of the moneth Cisleu: and they went into the Temple, and found not of pure oyl in the Sanctuary but only one bottle, and there was not in it so much as to light above one day: yet they lighted the lamps with it for eight dayes, until they had beaten their Olives and got pure oyl. And because of this, the wise men that were in that generation, ordained that those eight dayes, beginning from the</hi> 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>of Cisleu, should be dayes of rejoycing and thankesgiving: and they light up candles on them in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the doors of their houses, every night of the eight, for the declaring and setting forth of that miracle: and those dayes are called The Dedication,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Maym. in Chanuchah. per.</hi> 1.

               <p>THe order here is somewhat obscure, and that especially from these two things. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the first verse of all the Section, which may seem to be linked to the time of the verse preceding it in <hi>Luke. He went thorow the Cities and villages teaching and journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards Ierusalem. Then said one to him,</hi> &amp;c. 2. Because of that passage in <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.11. <hi>And it came to passe as he went to Ierusalem, he passed thorow the mids of Samaria and Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee,</hi> which might seem to be the same journey with that <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.22. and that all the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences in these Chapters were in that journey.</p>
               <p>But for the proof and cleering of the order, to be as we have laid it, these things are to be observed. 1. That this story wherewithall this Section beginneth, <hi>One said to him Lord, Are few to be saved?</hi> &amp;c. was on the same day that he crieth out, <hi>O Ierusalem, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 31, 34. Now that this was when <hi>Christ</hi> was no more to come up to <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> till his last coming up thither, is evident from his words, <hi>ver.</hi> 35. <hi>Ye shall no more see me till the time when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the Name of the Lord:</hi> So that this was after his coming up to the <hi>Feast of Dedication.</hi> And those words were spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, whilest he was yet at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> before he went away thence from that Feast to go beyond <hi>Iordan:</hi> The word <hi>Then</hi> therefore wherewith this Section beginneth in our Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish tran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That <hi>as he went to Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, he passed through Samaria and Galilee,</hi> it is to be understood of his last journey thither: and the manner of expression doth help to confirm our order, as we shall see there. <hi>Herod</hi> was now at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as compare <hi>ver.</hi> 31, &amp; 34. and it may be, he being Ruler of <hi>Galilee,</hi> had helped forward the death of these <hi>Galileans</hi> whom <hi>Pilate</hi> had slain as they were sacrificing: and an intimation of such like danger from him is given <hi>Iesus:</hi> And this may be conceived one cause that sets him out of the City, and to go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond <hi>Iordan,</hi> which is recorded in the last verses of the preceding Section, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 10.40. and how the order of story is to be cast in the readers thoughts it is easie to see. <hi>Christ</hi> being at the Feast of Dedication at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> one comes and asks him, <hi>Lord, are few to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi> Luk. 13.23. And <hi>the same day,</hi> ver. 31. some Pharisees tell him of danger from <hi>Herod.</hi> He answers, that it was true indeed that he was to die at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> for a Prophet could not be tried but by the great Council there [<hi>Talm. in Sanhedr. per.</hi> 11.] but he had yet some time to walk and work miracles before, and so he goes away from <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>

               <p>MATTHEW saith, <hi>When Iesus had finished these sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of Iudea beyond Iordan.</hi> Which sayings that he speaketh of, were finished a long while ago, at <hi>Sect.</hi> 55. but because he setteth down nothing betwixt that time and this journey over <hi>Iordan,</hi> therefore he thus joyneth their stories together: The time and actions that he hath omitted, we have seen how <hi>Luke</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
               <p>Were there any <hi>Coasts of Iudea beyond Iordan?</hi> Either the conjunction <hi>And</hi> is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, <hi>He came into the coasts of Iudea and beyond Iordan,</hi> as it is understood <hi>Psal.</hi> 133.3. <hi>Acts</hi> 7.16, &amp;c. or by <hi>Fines Iudaeae trans Iordanem,</hi> is meant <hi>Fines Iudaeorum,</hi> because the <hi>Syrians</hi> also dwelt in the coasts beyond <hi>Iordan.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Moses</hi> at the very same instant of time gave a Law to put an adulterous wife to death, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.22. and a Law to divorce her, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.1. in the former shewing the desert of the fact, in the latter permitting to mitigate of the rigour of that Law, and as our Saviour here interprets it, to prevent those cruel effects that their hardnesse of heart might have produced, had there been no mitigation. They brag of that Law of divorce as if favoured them as a peculiar priviledge. <hi>Ierus. kiddushen fol.</hi> 58.3. <hi>R. Chaijah Rabbah said, Divorces are not granted to the nations of the world,</hi> meaning not to the Gentiles as they were to the Jews: whereas truth here informs us, that it was permitted only because of the hardnesse of their hearts and to avoid greater mischief. When permission of divorce was given, after a Law to punish adultery with death, for a mitigation of it, it requires most serious weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether a Law to punish adultery with death should be undispensable now, after the Law of divorce given, and continued by our Saviour in case of fornication.</p>

The workmen repined and said, We have laboured all the day and this man laboured but two hours, and thou hast given him full wages with us: The King said to them, This man hath laboured more in two hours then you have done all day.

               <p>AT Sect. 63. <hi>Christ</hi> goeth beyond <hi>Iordan:</hi> the occasion of his coming back, was the message of <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha</hi> to him, to desire his help to their sick brother: The story of this therefore is necessary to be related before the story of his coming thence, which is the next thing that the other three Evangelists fall upon, after they have done with what is set down in the preceding Sections.</p>
               <p>The words of the second verse, <hi>It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and wiped his feet with her hair,</hi> are most generally construed as pointing to that story in the next Chapter, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12.3. Then <hi>took Mary a pound of oyntment of Spikenard very costly, and anointed the feet of Iesus, and wiped his feet with her hair</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Which seemeth very improper and unconsonant upon these reasons. 1. To what purpose should <hi>Iohn</hi> use such an anticipation? It was neither materiall to the story that he was entring on, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. to tell that <hi>Mary</hi> anoynted <hi>Christs</hi> feet a good while after he had raised her brother:
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:59067:36"/>
nor was it any other then needlesse to bring in the mention of it here, since he was to give the full story of it in the next Chapter. 2. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> is of such a tense as doth properly denote an action past, and is so to be rendred, if it be rendred in its just propriety, It was <hi>Mary which had anointed.</hi> 3. Whereas no reason can be given why <hi>Iohn</hi> should anticipate it here, if he meant it of an anointing that was yet to come, a plain and satisfactory reason may be given, why he speaks of it here, as referring to an anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting past, namely because he would shew what acquaintance and interest <hi>Mary</hi> had with <hi>Christ,</hi> which did imbolden her to send to him about her sick brother, for she had wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and anointed his feet heretofore. The words of <hi>Iohn</hi> therefore point at an action past, and indeed they point at that story of the woman-sinner washing the feet of <hi>Christ</hi> with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is true indeed that <hi>Iohn</hi> who useth these words that we are upon, had not spoken of any such anointing before, whereunto to refer you in his own Gospel, but the passage was so well and renownedly known and recorded by <hi>Luke</hi> before, that he relateth to it as to a thing of most famous notice and memoriall.</p>

               <p>THe order is plain of it self: and yet the connexion is somewhat strange: for in the last words before, <hi>Christ</hi> had foretold of his death, yet the sons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to sit on his right hand and left in his Kingdom. <hi>Galatius</hi> resolves it thus, <hi>Discipuli in errore aliquando fuerunt, credentes Christum illicò post resurrectionem terreni regni sceptro potiturum: unde &amp; quidam eorum, super caeteros primatum ambientes,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Disciples sometimes were mistaken, conceiving that Christ presently after his resurrection should obtain the scepter of an earthly Kingdom, whereupon some of them ambitious of priority above the rest, desired to sit on his right hand and left,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.

Therefore it cannot well be imagined, that the wife and sons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> thought of <hi>Christs</hi> resurrection in this their request, but conceived of his temporall Kingdom according to the notions of the rest of the Nation about it: What therefore our Saviour had spoken instantly before of his being scourged, crucified, killed, and Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing again, they understood in some figurative sense or other; but the Evangelists plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell us, they understood it not in the sense that he spake it. It may be his naming these two <hi>The sons of thunder,</hi> gave them some blinde incouragement to such a request. <hi>Christ</hi> foretels his own death and their suffering Martyrdom under the title of <hi>Baptism,</hi> in which sense the Apostle also useth the word 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.29. The Jewish baptizings or dippings in their purifications, was a very sharp piece of Religion, when in frost and snow and wind and weather they must over head ears in cold water, from which, the phrase was used to signifie death and the bitterest sufferings. The <hi>Ierusalem Gomarists</hi> do tell us, that the women of <hi>Galilee</hi> grew barren, by reason of the cold in their purifyings. <hi>R. Aba</hi> in the

                     <hi>JOHN Chap. XII.</hi> from begin. to <hi>Ver. 12.</hi> A Supper at Bethany: Iesus his feet anointed.</head>
                  <p>THe connexion of this story to the preceding Chapter, is plainly made by the Evangelist himself: Compare <hi>ver.</hi> 55. of <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. and <hi>ver.</hi> 1. of this.</p>
                  <p>Though there were a Proclamation out against Jesus for his life, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.57. yet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he for <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> at <hi>Bethany</hi> is not afraid to entertain him He may well venture his life for him who had received it from him. It was their Sabbath day at night when he had this Supper, a time that they used to have extraordinary cheer. <hi>Mary</hi> who had anointed his feet before, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.38. doth the like again.</p>
                  <p>There is a groundlesse and a strange opinion of some, that the Supper in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.6, 7. and <hi>Mark</hi> 14.3. was the same with this Supper in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. An imagination, that I cannot enough admire at, seeing there are so many things plainly to gainsay it: but the discussi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it shall be deferred till we come to those Chapters. Only one particular here may not be omitted without observation, and which will make something at present toward the confutation of that opinion, and that is our Saviours answer in the vindication of <hi>Maries</hi> act, <hi>Let her alone, against the day of my buriall hath she kept this:</hi> or rather, <hi>She hath kept it:</hi> Not that he meaneth that this anointing of his feet, was her anointing him against his buriall, but that she had kept some of this oyntment yet for that purpose here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. <hi>Iudas</hi> repined at the expence of the oyntment that she used for the anointing of his feet, and pleaded that it had been better bestowed upon charitable uses on the poor: Why? saith <hi>Christ,</hi> she hath kept it yet and not spent all, that she may bestow it upon a charitable use, the anointing of my body to its buriall. For 1. neither the text doth any whit assert that she spent the whole pound that she brought, nor indeed in reason was so great a quantity needfull. 2. It was not so proper to apply it to his buriall now, when as he was to ride in triumph to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to morrow, as it was two daies before the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over [when the other Supper and anointing was] which was the very night when <hi>Iudas</hi> compacted for his betraying. 3. Then <hi>Christ</hi> saith she poured it <hi>upon his body,</hi> Mat. 26.12. which cannot be of the same sense with pouring it upon his feet only. She therefore six daies before the Passeover anointed his feet, which was an ordinary use among the Jews to have their feet anointed, and the Talmudists give some rules about it in <hi>Talm. Ierus. Sanhedr. fol.</hi> 21. <hi>col.</hi> 1. and this she doth in dear love and affection to him: But two daies before the Passeover, she doth not so much anoint his head, as pour the ointment upon his head that it might run all over his body, and this she did towards his buriall, not only in his construction, but in her own intention: she being the first we reade of that beleeved his death, as she was the first that law him after his resurrection. Her faith and fact he foresaw, and therefore saith now at the anointing of his feet, that she <hi>yet kept it</hi> for the anointing of his body, which when she did, he extols the fact with this <hi>encomion,</hi> that wheresoever the Gospel should be preached, that action of her, the example of the first faith in his death, should be published in memoriall of her. Thus did this <hi>Mary,</hi> [who as hath been shewed was <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>] anoint <hi>Christ</hi> three severall times, his feet at her first conversion, and his feet again at this time, six daies before the Passeover, and his head and body two daies before the Passeover, even that night that <hi>Iudas</hi> first went about to make his bargain for betraying him.</p>

               <p>Talm. Bab. Pesachin fol. 63. fac. 2. <hi>He that slayes a Thanksgiving Sacrifice within, while the bread belonging to it is without the wall, the bread is not holy.</hi> What means <hi>without the wall? R. Iochanan</hi> saith, <hi>Without the wall of Bethpage.</hi> The Glosse there saith, <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page was an outer place of Ierusalem.</hi> And the same Glosse useth the very same words again upon the same Tract, fol. 91. fac. 1. And again in the same Treatise, fol. 95. fac. 2. the <hi>Mishnah</hi> saith thus, <hi>The two loaves and the shewbread are allowable in the Temple Court, and they are allowable in Bethpage.</hi> Nay the Glosse in <hi>Sanhedr. fol.</hi> 14. <hi>fac.</hi> 1. saith, <hi>Bethpage was a place which was accounted as Ierusalem for all things.</hi> So that the place so called, began from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and went onwards to and upon mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> for the space of a Sabbath daies journey or thereabout, and then began the coast that was called <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thany.</hi> And hence it is that <hi>Luke</hi> saith that <hi>Christ</hi> when he ascended into heaven, led forth his Disciples as farre as <hi>Bethany,</hi> Luke 24.50. which elsewhere he sheweth was the space of <hi>a Sabbath daies journey,</hi> Acts 1.12. which cannot be understood of the Town <hi>Bethany,</hi> for that was fifteen furlongs, or very near two Sabbath daies jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> but that he led them over that space of ground which was called <hi>Bethpage,</hi> to that part of <hi>Olivet</hi> where it began to be called <hi>Bethany,</hi> and at that place it was where <hi>Christ</hi> began his triumphant riding into the City at this time.</p>
               <p>It is very observable that he is entertained with <hi>the solemnity of the Feast of Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles:</hi> for carrying of Palm branches and crying <hi>Hosanna</hi> was never used but only at that Feast, but now translated to this occasion: which may help somewhat to the explaining of <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.16.</p>
               <p>Count from hence the daies to the Passeover, as the Evangelists have reckoned them, and you will finde that this was the first day of the week [the Lords day afterward] and this day seven night he rose from the dead.</p>
               <p>In the midst of his triumph he weepeth over the City, though he knew that within five daies she would be his death.</p>

               <p>THe order is clear in <hi>Mark</hi> v.11.12.</p>
               <p>Christ after his riding into <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> having spent all the day there, goeth at even to lodge at <hi>Bethany:</hi> and in the morning going for <hi>Ierusalem</hi> again and hungring seeth a figtree, and finding no figs on it curseth it, and yet the Evangelist telleth that <hi>the time of figs was not yet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why then should <hi>Christ</hi> look for figs, when he knew the time of the year was not yet for them?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> He looked not for any figs that he thought could be grown ripe and fit to eat, that spring, it being now at the furthest but about our <hi>April,</hi> but he looked for those that grew the last summer, and had hung on the trees all winter. It is true indeed that some trees had shot forth their fruit by Passeover time, for so <hi>Maymony</hi> tels us in <hi>Kiadush Hhodesh</hi> per. 4. but neither to ripenesse; nor was the figtree any of them. For to those words of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.32. <hi>When the figtree putteth forth her leaves ye know sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is nigh,</hi> lay these of <hi>Ierus. in Sheviith fol.</hi> 35. <hi>col.</hi> 4. <hi>Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel</hi> saith, <hi>From the putting forth of the figtree leaf to the green figs appearing are fifty daies: and from the first appearing of the fig to the fall of the blossom fifty daies, and from thence to the ripe figs fifty daies more:</hi> five moneths in all.</p>
               <p>There were severall kinds of figtrees in that Land, as the Jews tell us in the Treatises <hi>Demai</hi> and <hi>Sheviith,</hi> where they have speciall occasion to treat of that matter, [besides those figtrees that were in their Orchards and Vineyards.] As 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which they say were <hi>figs of the wildernesse.</hi> 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which were baser figs likewise. 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> figtrees that brought their fruit to ripenesse but once in two years. And 4. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> which they say, grew in the fields and bare white figs <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> from three years to three years. The <hi>Gomarists</hi> dispute, <hi>What? Do they bear their fruit every year, or only once in three years? They bear their fruit every year, but it is not ripe till three years end. How doth a man know its time,</hi> or what year it is with it? <hi>R. Ionah</hi> saith, <hi>by binding a list about it. It is a tradition of Samuel, that he hung some pendants upon it.</hi> The meaning of the matter is this: There was a figtree growing in the fields of this nature, that the figs that it shot forth one summer, it was two summers more before they came to ripenesse, so that they hung upon the tree [unless hands or winde hindered] three summers and two winters before their maturity: Now because the strange nature of this tree, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from others, caused that the seventh year, or year of release could not so easily be remembred and observed concerning it as concerning other trees, therefore they tied some coards or lists about it, or hung something upon it, that might give notice, and keep in remembrance what year it was with it, and whether the fruit, if any, were of the first, second or third years growth. So likewise the figtrees mentioned before, called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> were two summers in ripening their fruit. So that of such a tree as one of
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:59067:38"/>
these <hi>Christ</hi> might well look for figs of the last years growth, old figs under new leaves, if so be the leaves were new. Yet could not this properly be called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> [as there are that would change the reading of the originall, and instead of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>for the time of figs was not yet,</hi> would have it read (but I question whether with the consent of any one copy in the world) <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>For where he was, was the time of figs.</hi>] For that phrase, <hi>The time of figs,</hi> meaneth the common time that generally figs were ripe, which was ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and commonly known, and which was not of well near five moneths after Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christ</hi> cometh to the Temple and casteth out buyers and sellers as he had done three years before: this was four daies before the Passeover. At Even he goeth and lodgeth in <hi>Bethany.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the morning he cometh again to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> This was three daies before the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over. As they came, the Disciples observe the figtree withered, whereupon he saith, <hi>Have faith in God, for verily I say unto you, that whosoever shall say to this mountain, Be thou removed and he cast into the sea, and shall not doubt in his heart but beleeve that those things which he saith shall come to passe, he shall have whatsoever he saith.</hi> In which words he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther warranteth nor encourageth any to look for a faith that should remove mountains; but 1. He speaketh Hyperbolically for the magnifying of the power and excellency of faith, as <hi>Mark</hi> 9.23. <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> with which the Scripture abounds, are not to be taken according to the letter, but the thing intended is to be taken at the higher pitch. As to instance but in one example, and that about this very mountain that <hi>Christ</hi> pointed at, <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.4. which meaneth not literally <hi>Olivets</hi> cleaving indeed or removing, but great concussions to the people, and open way made for the enemy. 2. <hi>Christ</hi> in this expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion speaks the Jews own language, and by the very phrase that they ordinarily used to magnifie their own abilities by, he magnifieth faith. When they would speak of the high parts and qualities of their great ones, they used to say, <hi>He is a remover of mountains,</hi> Tal. Bab. Beracoth. fol. 64. fac. 1. <hi>Sinai and the Remover of mountains, whether of them sent first,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Now Rabh Ioseph was Sinai, and Rabbah was The remover of mountains.</hi> Why so named? The Glosse upon the place resolves us thus, <hi>They called Rabh Ioseph Sinai, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was most expert in deep explications. And they called Rabbah bar Nachmani A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mover of mountains, because he was most acutely learned,</hi> &amp;c. The same Talmud also in Erubhin fol. 29. saith thus, <hi>Rabba saith, Behold I am like ben Azzai in the streets of Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias.</hi> The Glosse thereupon saith thus, <hi>Ben Azzai taught profoundly in the streets of Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias, and there was no man in his daies that was a remover of mountains like him.</hi> By <hi>remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of mountains</hi> meaning how able men they were, and how they could overcome the greatest difficulties in Divinity. Which common phrase <hi>Christ</hi> useth to face that wretched boasting of theirs of their own parts and worth, and to set up faith in its proper dignity, as that that is only able for all things.</p>

               <p>The question proposed, Whether it were lawfull to give tribute to <hi>Cesar,</hi> proceeded from that old <hi>maxime</hi> among them, upon mistake of <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.15. <hi>that they ought not to be subject to any power or potentate, which was not of their own blood or Religion:</hi> the holding to which <hi>maxime,</hi> cost them the ruine of their City and Nation.</p>

               <p>He concludeth his speech with the intimation of what shame and guilt lay upon them for the blood of the former Prophets slain by their fathers, filled up by their own wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse in persecuting those that he did or should send to them.

He doomes all the Prophets to be required of that generation, because they by their transcendent abuse of those whom God sent, even of <hi>Messias</hi> himself, did justifie and exceed all the evil their fathers had done against the Prophets: Yea all the blood shed before the blood of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charias,</hi> and his, though they held that to have been satisfied for, by the destruction, slaughter and captivity by the Babylonians, <hi>Ierus. in Taanith fol.</hi> 69. <hi>col.</hi> 2.

And after these <hi>MATTH. Chap. XXV.</hi> all the Chapter. <hi>CHRIST</hi> foretelleth the destruction of Ierusalem, the signes and miseries preceding and accompanying it.</head>
               <p>THe <hi>Talmud</hi> tells us that there was a place upon mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> just in the face of the Temple, where the Priest slew and burnt the red Cow into the ashes of purification, and as he sprinkled the blood, he looked directly upon the Temple door. <hi>Middeth Per.</hi> 1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This was the last Sermon that Christ made upon mount <hi>Olivet,</hi> and he makes it as he sits upon that mount, just facing the Temple, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.3. And that text that he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in tears but two or three dayes ago, weeping over the City and foretelling the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.44. he now preacheth upon at large, declaring the misery and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewing the forerunners of that destruction.</p>
               <p>The aim of his speech, or, to what time and purpose it refers, may be discerned by the question of the Disciples, to which it is an answer. <hi>When shall these things be,</hi> viz. that one stone stone of the Temple shall not be left upon another? <hi>Mark.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.7. and so it relates plainly to the destruction of the Temple and City. But <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> hath added; <hi>And what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world?</hi> from whence it is conceived by some, that the speech doth aim at the end of the world, and <hi>Christs</hi> last coming unto judgment. It is true indeed that the close of his speech in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. doth speak plainly of the last judgment, and that many of those terrible things men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. may very well typifie the terrours of the last day, but the prime and proper scope of the speech in that 24<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, is to set forth the destruction of <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and the rejection and misery of the Jewish nation; as may be observed by these particulers.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because in <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.15, 16. He points directly to time and place, when and where these things shall be, <hi>viz.</hi> when the Temple shall be profaned, then these things come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Especiall consider <hi>ver.</hi> 34. <hi>Verily I say unto you; This generation shall not passe till all these things be fulfilled. This generation,</hi> not meaning <hi>Generatio Evangelica,</hi> as some do harshly interpret it, but as it means in <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.36. <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.31, 32. and abundance of other places in the new Testament, <hi>the generation then in being.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. The destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> is phrased in Scripture as the destruction of the whole world, <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.23. <hi>Isa.</hi> 65.17. and <hi>Christs coming</hi> to her in judgment, as his <hi>coming</hi> to the last judgment, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.28. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 21.22. <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.28. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore those dreadfull things spoken of in <hi>ver.</hi> 29.30, 31. are but borrowed expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions to set forth the terrors of that judgment the more. <hi>Ver.</hi> 29. <hi>The Sun shall be darken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> &amp;c. shews the decay of all glory, excellency and prosperity in that nation, and the coming in of all sadnesse, misery and confusion: as <hi>Isa.</hi> 13.10. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.10. <hi>Ver.</hi> 30. <hi>Then shall they see the sign of the Sonne of man,</hi> &amp;c. Not any visible appearance of <hi>Christ,</hi> or of the crosse in the clouds [as some have imagined,] but whereas the Jews would not own <hi>Christ</hi> before for <hi>the Sonne of man,</hi> or for the <hi>Messias,</hi> then by the vengeance that he should execute upon them, they and all the world should see an evident signe, that he was so. This therefore is called <hi>his coming,</hi> and <hi>his coming in his kingdom,</hi> Matth. 17.28. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this did first declare his power, glory and victory on that nation that had despised him. <hi>Ver.</hi> 31. <hi>He shall send his Angels with a great sound of a Trumpet,</hi> &amp;c. that is, his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters with the Trumpet of the Gospel, to fetch in his elect from among the Gentiles when the Jews were now destroyed and cast off. And the false Christs, and false Prophets that should arise, <hi>ver.</hi> 5.24. arose in that nation in those <hi>last dayes</hi> of it, as is abundantly evident both in the new Testament, and in <hi>Iosephus:</hi> And those <hi>warres and rumours of warres, and nation rising against nation,</hi> &amp;c. ver. 6, 7. were accomplished not only in the horrid civil warres among the Jews, but also in the great concussions in the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, in the warres betwixt <hi>Otho</hi> and <hi>Vitellius,</hi> and betwixt <hi>Vitellius</hi> and <hi>Vespasian,</hi> [of which the Romane Historians, especially <hi>Tacitus</hi> is very large] the like to which, there had not been before, even to the sacking of <hi>Rome</hi> it self, and the burning of the <hi>Capitoll.</hi>

And after these portions read <hi>JOHN Chap. XIII.</hi> from the beginning to <hi>Ver. 27. CHRISTS</hi> head annointed at a supper at <hi>Bethany</hi> two nights before the Passeover: At the same supper he washeth his Disciples feet: giveth <hi>Judas</hi> the sop and the Devil entreth into him.</head>
               <p>THe proof of the proper order here will require some dispute, not so much in regard of any obscurity or difficulty of the order it self, but in regard of needlesse and groundlesse difficulties that are put upon it. There are two strange opinions we meet with here: The one is, that holdeth that this supper mentioned by <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> was the same supper which is mentioned in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. which was <hi>six dayes before the Passeover.</hi> And the other is, that holdeth, that this supper in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. was the supper on the Passeover night: so that for the shewing and asserting of the order as we have laid it, these three things are to be done.</p>
               <p>First, It is to be proved, that the supper in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. and the supper in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. and <hi>Mark</hi> 14. were not one and the same supper, but two suppers at some dayes distance. Secondly, That the supper in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. was not on the Passeover night, but before the Passe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over night. And thirdly, That the supper in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. was the same supper with that in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.6. and <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.3. two dayes before the Passeover.</p>
               <p>First, That the supper in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. and the supper in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. and <hi>Mark</hi> 14. were two different suppers [to which something hath been said before,] appears by these observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. 1. The supper in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. was in the house of <hi>Lazarus</hi> [unlesse we will unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably strain the construction of the story,] but the supper in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. and <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. was in the house of <hi>Simon the Leper.</hi> 2. At the supper in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 12. <hi>Christs</hi> feet were annointed, but his head was annointed at the supper in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. and <hi>Mark</hi> 14.3. The supper in <hi>Ion.</hi> 12. was <hi>six dayes</hi> before the Passeover, but the supper in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. and <hi>Mark</hi> 14. was but <hi>two dayes</hi> before: For observe <hi>Mark</hi> 14.1. <hi>After two dayes was the feast of the Passeover</hi>: and then <hi>ver.</hi> 3. <hi>And Iesus being at Bethany, &amp;c.</hi> Here they that hold the opinion that we are confuting, will not acknowledge the order of the Evangelists direct, but say there is a dislocation, so that though <hi>two dayes</hi> be mentioned before, yet the story following was six dayes before the Passeover. But the method of <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> hath been so direct hither through the story of <hi>Christs</hi> actions, since his last coming to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> that no reason possible can be given why they should invert the order here. They had punctually mentioned his actions, five, four, three dayes before the Passeover, and now they come to speak of two dayes before, and under that account bring in this supper, and what sense or reason can there be to surmise that it was six dayes before? They had shewed you <hi>Christ</hi> five dayes before the Passeover, at <hi>Bethany,</hi> Joh. 12.1, 12. <hi>Mark</hi> 11.1, 11. And four dayes before the Passeover, at <hi>Bethany,</hi> Mark 11.12, 15, 19, 20. And three dayes before the Passeover, at <hi>Bethany,</hi> Mark 11.20, 27. &amp; 13.3. And then they come and speak of two dayes before the Passeover, and they speak also of <hi>Christs</hi> being at <hi>Bethany,</hi> and yet would the opinion under confutation apply the reckoning of the <hi>two dayes</hi> only to point at the high-Priests assembling: and <hi>Christs</hi> being at <hi>Bethany,</hi> to be jumped backward over all the story before, even to beyond <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. <hi>Mark.</hi> 11. An opinion that by its improbability is confutation enough to it self.</p>
               <p>A second think to be cleered is, that the supper in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. was not on the Passeover night but before: which may be evidenced by these arguments instead of more. 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Iohn</hi> saith expresly <hi>ver.</hi> 1. that it was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>before the festivall of the Passeover,</hi> for so the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> constantly signifies, not the meal of the Paschal, as some would construe it here, but the whole festivall. 2. The Disciples when <hi>Iesus</hi> said to <hi>Iudas, What thou doest, do quickly,</hi> thought he spake about buying something against the feast, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. by which it appears that the feast was not yet come.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Luke</hi> sheweth, that the entring of <hi>Satan</hi> into <hi>Iudas</hi> [which was at the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.] was before the Passeover day came: for observe his order, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.3. <hi>Then entred Satan into Iudas, and he went and communed with the chief Priests,</hi> &amp;c. and then <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Then came the day of unleavened bread:</hi> Upon all which considerations, it is apparent, that this supper in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. at which <hi>Satan</hi> entred into <hi>Iudas</hi> [whereupon he
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:59067:41"/>
went and compacted for his Masters betraying] was not on the Passeover night, but some space before the Passeover day came. There is indeed a passage in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.38. which may seem to bring that supper to the Passeover night, which is, when <hi>Christ</hi> saith at the supper to <hi>Peter, The Cock shall not crow till thou hast denied me thrice,</hi> which seemeth to carry it, as if this supper were on that very night when <hi>Peter</hi> denied him. For answer to which, let it be observed: 1. That <hi>Peter</hi> denied <hi>Christ</hi> but once before the Cock crew. <hi>Mark</hi> 14.68, 69, 70. and it will teach us to expound the words of <hi>Christ, Ioh.</hi> 13.38. &amp; <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.24. not as meaning that he should deny him three times over before any Cock crew, but that he should deny him thrice in the time of Cocks crowing, which time was a fourth part of the night, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.34. And that it meaneth in such a sense is yet more apparent by <hi>Mark</hi> 14.30. where he utters it, <hi>The Cock shall not crow twice.</hi> 2. Let it be observed, that in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.38. it is only said, <hi>The Cock shall not crow,</hi> but in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>Mark.</hi> 14. when the speech refers to the very night when his deniall was, it is said, <hi>This night,</hi> before the Cock crow; And, <hi>This day, even this night</hi> before the Cock crow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And so it is to be understood that <hi>Christ</hi> used that speech to <hi>Peter</hi> twice over, and in it he doth twice refute his presuming upon his own strength which <hi>Peter</hi> twice shewed: First at the supper in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. which was two dayes before the Passeover, and there the <hi>emphasis</hi> of the speech lieth especially in the word <hi>Thrice;</hi> as if he had said to him, Art thou so confident of thy strength and standing for me? I tell thee the time will be, when thou shalt deny me <hi>thrice</hi> in the time of Cocks crowing. The second was at the Passeover supper, and then Christ puts the <hi>emphasis</hi> upon the word <hi>This night:</hi> Art thou so confident? I tell thee <hi>this night</hi> thou shalt deny me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus having shewed that that supper in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. was not on the Passeover night, but before; a third thing is to shew, that it was two dayes before the Passeover, and the same with that supper mentioned by <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> in <hi>Bethany:</hi> And for the proof of this we need go no further then this observation: That both the Evangelists <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> do begin the treason of <hi>Iudas</hi> from that supper in <hi>Bethany,</hi> Matth. 26.13, 14. Mark 14.9, 10. for as soon as they have related the story of that supper, they presently tell, <hi>Then one of the twelve called Iudas went to the chief Prists,</hi> &amp;c. Now it is apparent that he began the acting of his treason from the time of <hi>Satans</hi> entring into him with the sop which was at that supper <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. and so it concludeth that to be the same supper with that in <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.6.</p>
               <p>The texture of the story then lieth thus: Six dayes before the Passeover <hi>Christ</hi> suppeth and lodgeth in <hi>Bethany:</hi> five dayes before the Passeover he rideth in triumph to <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and at even cometh and lodgeth in <hi>Bethany</hi> again, four dayes before the Passeover he goeth to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> again, and at night cometh to <hi>Bethany</hi> again to lodge. The third day before the Passeover he goeth again into the City; and at even cometh to <hi>Bethany</hi> again: And that night he suppeth in the house of <hi>Simon the Leper,</hi> it being now two dayes to the Passeover: As he sits at supper, <hi>Mary the sister of Lazarus,</hi> called also <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> annoints his head, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he before the table was taken away, ariseth from the table and washeth the Disciples feet, and after sits down and gives <hi>Iudas</hi> the sop.</p>

               <p>THe continuation of the story in <hi>Iohn</hi> cleareth the connexion. <hi>He dipped the sop and gave it to Iudas, And after the sop Satan entred into him.</hi> This was at a supper in <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thany</hi> two dayes before the Passeover, as hath been shewed: From thence, though it were night, <hi>Iudas</hi> trudgeth to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> acted intirely by <hi>Satan,</hi> and agreeth with the <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin</hi> for his Masters betraying. They had met purposely to contrive the apprehension and death of <hi>Christ,</hi> but had resolved, that it must not be at the feast, for fear of tumult: but <hi>Iudas</hi> coming in, undertakes to deliver him up, though at the feast, yet quietly enough in the absence of the people: And they bargain to give him thirty pieces of silver; the price of a servant, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.22.

For the better judging of the time of this speech [besides the connexion which joyns it to <hi>Iudas</hi> his going forth upon the devils entring into him with the sop] these two things are observable. 1. That the last words of the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                  <hi>Chapter</hi> are, <hi>Arise, let us go hence,</hi> by which it is plain, that the speech contained in this present Section, and the speech in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 15, &amp; 16, and 17. were spoken at two severall times and in two severall places. That, at the Passeover supper, for <hi>Iohn</hi> tells, <hi>Chap.</hi> 18.1. that when Jesus had finished that speech, he went over the brook <hi>Kidron:</hi> but this, before, and in another place, because upon the ending of it it is plain Jesus removed to another place, by his saying, <hi>Arise let us go hence.</hi> 2. That <hi>Christ</hi> saith, <hi>Yet a little time I am with you,</hi> Chap. 13. ver. 33. <hi>Yet a little while and the world seeth me no more,</hi> Chap. 14. ver. 19. <hi>Hereafter I shall not talk much with you,</hi> ver. 30. which intimate some space of time yet to come, and not so suddain a parting, as the space was betwixt his rising from his last supper, and his apprehension. This speech therefore was spoken at <hi>Bethany</hi> after <hi>Iudas</hi> his going out: and the Section contains the summe of Christs discourse with his Disciples, while he staid there, which was the night that <hi>Iudas</hi> received the sop, and the next day and night, and till towards the evening of the day after: And the last words, <hi>Arise, let us go hence,</hi> intimate his removall from <hi>Bethany</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> on the Passeover day. <hi>Iudas</hi> either that night that he had received the sop, or the next day, layeth the plot with the high-Priests for the delivering up of his Master at the feast, and having so done, he returneth to his Master to <hi>Bethany</hi> again. And the next day which was the Passeover day, <hi>Christ</hi> sendeth <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> from thence to prepare the Passeover for him, and when he saw time, he calls, <hi>Arise, let us go hence,</hi> and so he setteth for <hi>Ierusalem</hi> with the rest of the Disciples and <hi>Iudas</hi> in the company.</p>

               </head>
               <p>PETER and <hi>Iohn</hi> who were sent to prepare the Passeover, had this work to do. They were to get a room fitting; to that their Master directs them by a sign. They were to get a Lamb, and to bring him into the Temple, and there to have him killed and his blood sprinkled, under the name of a Paschall for thirteen persons. For no Lamb could be eaten for a Paschall, whose blood was not first sprinkled at the Altar, and that <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the name of a Paschall, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> by count for such a number of persons as had agreed to be at the eating of him. <hi>Talm. in Pesachin.</hi> per. 5. [as Christ died but for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number.] Which shews [had not the Evangelists done it otherwise] that <hi>Christ</hi> ate his Passeover on the same day that the Jews did theirs [which some, upon misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of <hi>Ioh.</hi> 18.28. have denied] nay that it was not possible otherwise, for how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible was it to get the Priests to kill a Paschall for any, upon a wrong day?</p>
               <p>Having got the Lamb thus slain at the Temple, they were to bring him home to the house where he was to be eaten, to get him roasted, and to get bread and wine ready, and what other provision was usuall and requisite for that meal.</p>
               <p>At Even <hi>Iesus</hi> cometh and sitteth down <hi>with the twelve:</hi> and as he ate, he gave inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Traitour, who was now at the table and eating with him. Which might seem to make this story the same with that in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13.21, 22. and so might argue, that this and that were but one and the same Supper. But herein is an apparent difference in the stories. 1. At the Supper in <hi>Ioh.</hi> 13. <hi>Christ</hi> giveth only a private signification of the Traitour by a token given secretly to <hi>Iohn,</hi> but here he points him out openly. 2. There
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:59067:42"/>
he gives him a sop, here he only speaks of dipping with him in the dish. Only there is some diversity in the Evangelists, in relating this story: <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> have laid this taxation and discovery of the Traytour before the administration of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but <hi>Luke</hi> after.</p>
               <p>And there is the like variety in their relating the time of these words of <hi>Christ, I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine,</hi> &amp;c. for <hi>Luke</hi> hath brought them in as spoken before the Sacrament, but the other two after. In both which, first the main intent of the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be looked after, and then may we better state the time. The intent in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, is to shew <hi>Iudas</hi> at the Table, and at the Table all the time both of the Paschall and the Lords Supper, those symboles of love and communion, yet he such a wretch as to communicate in both, and yet a Traitour. The two, <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> would shew that he was at the Table, and so the mention of that they bring in upon <hi>Christs</hi> first sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down and beginning to eat: And <hi>Luke</hi> makes the story full, and shews that he was at the Table all the time, both at Passeover and Sacrament, and the words of <hi>Christ</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the delivering of the Cup, <hi>But behold the hand of him that betrays me,</hi> &amp;c. cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be mitigated from such a construction. As to the later, the meaning of <hi>Christ</hi> in the words, <hi>I will no more drink of the fruit of the vine,</hi> &amp;c. is, that the Kingdom of God was now so near, that this was the last meat and drink, or the last meal that he was to have, before that came. By <hi>the Kingdom of God,</hi> meaning his resurrection and forward, when God by him had conquered death, <hi>Satan</hi> and hell. And whereas he saith, <hi>Till I drink it n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>w with you in the Kingdom of God,</hi> he did so, eating and drinking with them after his resurrection. This therefore being the aim of his speech, it was seasonable to say so, any time of the meal, <hi>This is the last meal I must eat with you till I be risen again from the dead.</hi> And hereupon the Evangelists have left the time of his uttering of it at that indifferency, that they have done. And indeed these two passages had such reference one to another, that the one might bring on the other, and both of them might very well be spoken by <hi>Christ</hi> twice: The observing of the direct order of <hi>Christs</hi> actions at this meal, which the Evangelists have related, will help to clear this matter.</p>
               <p>When he was set down with them, he first saith, <hi>I have desired to eat this Passeover with you before I suffer,</hi> for this is the last I must eat with you before the Kingdom of God be come. And thereupon he taketh the first cup of wine that was to be drunk at that meal, and drinks of it and gives it them, and bids, <hi>Divide it among your selves, for I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine,</hi> &amp;c. meaning, this is the last time I shall eat and drink with you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this speech properly brought in the other, <hi>One of you shall betray me:</hi> as paraphrased, speaking thus, I shall no more eat with you, for there is one now at the table with me, hath compassed my death. Hereupon they question who it should be, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After this passage they eat the Paschall Lamb after its rite, and after it, he ordaineth the Lords Supper: Bread to be <hi>his Body</hi> henceforward, in the same sense that the <hi>Paschall Lamb had been his Body</hi> hitherto, and <hi>the Cup to be the New Testament in his Blood</hi> now under the Gospel, as <hi>the blood of Bullocks had been the Old Testament in his Blood,</hi> Exod. 24. And after the administring of the Cup, he tels them again, that that was the last that he must drink, for the hand of him that betrayed him was at the Table.</p>

               <p>LUKE himself is a clear warrant for the order. And withall, the joynt consideration of the story before will help to confirm it. The question among themselves about the traitour, helpeth to draw on this other question about priority: An unseasonable and a very unreasonable quarrell: To which their Master giveth closely this twofold an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, besides proposing his own example of humility. 1. That let not them stand upon priority, for he would equally honour them in his Kingdom, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2. That this was not a time to stand upon such businesse as seeking to be preferred one before another, for this was a time of sifting, and a time when all the care they could take for their safety should be little enough: therefore they had now something else to do then to look after precedency.</p>

At their Passeover Suppers they used large discourses seasonable and agreeable to the occasion: and especially in commemorating what God had done for that people.

                  <hi>CHRISTS</hi> Apprehension, Arraignment, Death and Buriall.</head>
               <p>THere is no difficulty in the connexion of the beginning of this Section to the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, but only this, that the rest of the Evangelists make mention of <hi>Christs</hi> singing of <hi>an hymn,</hi> as the last thing he did, before his setting out for the mount of <hi>Olives</hi>; but <hi>Iohn</hi> maketh his speech and prayer to be last, and speaketh not of his singing of a hymn at all. Which indeed is neither contrariety nor diversity of story, but only variety of relation for the holding out of the story more compleat. The three former Evangelists have recorded how <hi>Christ</hi> did celebrate the Passeover and ordain the Sacrament at the end of it, and therefore they properly speak of his singing an hymn, for that was ever an unseparable piece of service at the Passeover Supper, and constantly used at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of that meal: But <hi>Iohn</hi> had made no mention of the Passeover Supper or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at all, and therefore it was not only not needfull, but also not proper, that he should mention the singing of any hymn at all: But he relateth the last speech and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Christ,</hi> which the other had omitted. And whether this speech recorded by him, or the hymn mentioned by them, were last done by <hi>Christ,</hi> is not much materiall to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the story. I suppose the speech was later. The hymn that they sung was <hi>Psal.</hi> 115. &amp; 116. &amp; 117. &amp; 118. which was the later part of <hi>the great Hallel</hi> as they called it, which was constantly sung at the Passeover and their other great Solemnities, and with this later part was this Solemnity concluded.</p>

                  <head>His Prayer in the Garden.</head>
                  <p>CHRIST rising from Supper, goeth forth of the City over the brook <hi>Kidron</hi> to the mount of <hi>Olives.</hi> [Compare <hi>Davids</hi> case and journey, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.23.] <hi>Iudas</hi> when they rose from the table, slips away into the City, and there hath his cut-throats laid ready by the chief Priests, for the cursed design that they had compacted about. As <hi>Christ</hi> goeth along he telleth the eleven that were with him, of their trouble that night by his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, and their scattering from him: but he would be in <hi>Galilee</hi> before them, and there they should meet again. And so he directeth them which way to betake themselves after the Feast, and what to do when their Master should be taken from them by death. He foretelleth <hi>Peter</hi> again of his deniall of him that night: which <hi>Peter</hi> now armed with a sword cannot hear of, but promiseth great matters.</p>
                  <p>He cometh to <hi>Gethsemany, A place of Oyl presses,</hi> at the foot of <hi>Olivet,</hi> into a Garden. The <hi>Talmudists</hi> speak of the Gardens here, and tell how the Gardiners used to fatten their grounds with the scouring of the sink that carried the blood and filth of the Temple Court into that valley. Leaving eight Disciples behinde, he taketh <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> with him, and imparteth to them the fears and sorrows that now seized upon him, and leaving them also about a stones cast behinde, charging them to watch and pray: He prayes thrice for the removall of this Cup if possible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in an Agony he sweats
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:59067:43"/>
drops like blood. [Remember <hi>Adams</hi> fall in a Garden, and the first doom, <hi>In the sweat of thy brows,</hi> &amp;c.] Now was <hi>the power of darknesse,</hi> Luke 22.23. all the power of hell being let loose against <hi>Christ,</hi> as it never was against person upon earth before or since, and that from the pitching of this field of old, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Thou shalt bruise his heel.</hi> So that it was not so much for any p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

His desiring the removall of the Cup was <hi>purae humanitatis,</hi> but his submitting to the will of God <hi>purae sanctitatis:</hi> As when a gangrened member is to be cut off, <hi>pura natura</hi> relucts against it, but right reason yields to it. He prayed thrice, and after every time came to his three Disciples, and still found them sleeping.</p>

                  <p>He had scarce awakened them at the third time, when the Traytour and his Assasines are upon him to apprehend him. At their first approach <hi>Iudas</hi> according to the sign gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that his fellow-villains might know <hi>Iesus</hi> from the rest, steppeth to him and kisseth him. And thereupon the rest draw up near him. <hi>Iesus</hi> steppeth forward to meet them, and asketh, <hi>Whom seek ye?</hi> They say, <hi>Iesus of Nazareth:</hi> he saith <hi>I am he:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon they went backward and fell to the ground: And his thus confounding them with a word, shewed, that none could take his life from him, unless he laid it down of himself. While they lie on the ground, and he hath them thus under him, he indents for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission of his Disciples, and having agreed for their safety and discharge, he yields him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. So up they got, and lay hold upon him: and <hi>Peter</hi> to shew some of his promised stoutness cuts off <hi>Malchus</hi> ear, but <hi>Christ</hi> heals the wound. With this wretched crue that apprehended him, there were some of their Masters that set them on, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.52. To all together he telleth, that it was plain it was now their <hi>hour and the power of darknesse,</hi> for that they had him so oft among them in the Temple, that they were never able to lay hands on him till now: Upon these words the Disciples think it time to shift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: And one flees away naked.</p>

as it were, force them to agree with him that it was so, when his garments had paid so dear, for the confirming of it.

In the space between, the Highpriest is questioning <hi>Iesus</hi> of his Disciples and Doctrine, and because he answers, <hi>Ask them that have heard me,</hi> &amp;c. an officious Officer smites him, as if he had not answered with reverence enough. <hi>Peter</hi> this while was in the porch, where he was when the Cock crew after his first deniall: and there another maid sees him and brings him to the company that stood by the fire, and challenges him for one of his Disciples, and now he denies with an oath. And about an hour after, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.59. [which space of time the Bench took up in examining <hi>Christ</hi> about his Disciples and Doctrine] a kinsman of <hi>Malchus</hi> challengeth him, and tels the company he saw him with <hi>Iesus</hi> in the Garden, and he pleading the contrary, is discovered to all the company to be a Galilean by his Dialect, but he denies with execrations: and presently the second Cock crew: And Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus looking back upon him, he remembers what he had done and goes out and weeps bitterly. And so presently after the second Cock the Bench riseth and leaveth <hi>Iesus</hi> in the hands of their Officers, by whom he is taunted, stricken and shamefully used.</p>

                     <hi>Pilate</hi> conceives him brought to him as a common malefactor, and therefore he bids them take him back and Judge him by their own Bench and Law: and in these words he meant really and according as the truth was, that it was in their power to judge and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute him, and needed not to trouble him with him. And when they answer, <hi>We may not put any man to death,</hi> Joh. 18.31.

                  <p>The words then of these men to <hi>Pilate</hi> are true indeed, <hi>That they could put no man to death,</hi> but this was not, as if the <hi>Romans</hi> had deprived the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> of its power, but
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:59067:44"/>
because theeves, murderers and malefactors of their own Nation were grown so nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, strong and heady that they had overpowred the <hi>Sanhedrins</hi> power, that it could not, it durst not execute capitall penalties upon offenders as it should have done. And this their own Writings witnesse. Juchasin fol. 21. <hi>The Sanhedrin flitted fourty years before the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of the Temple, namely from that time that the Temple doors opened of their own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and Rabban Iochanan ben Zaccai rebuked them and said, O Temple, Temple, Zechary of old prophecied of thee saying, Open thy doors O Lebanon that the fire may enter,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And also because that murderers increased, and they were unwilling to judge Capitall matters, they flitted from place to place, even to Iabneh,</hi> &amp;c. which also is asserted in <hi>Shabb. fol.</hi> 51. <hi>Avo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah Zarah. fol.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>When they perceive that <hi>Pilate</hi> no more received the impression of their accusation of him as a malefactor like others, they then accuse him of Treason, as forbidding to pay Tribute to <hi>Cesar,</hi> and as saying that he himself was a King: and this they thought would do the businesse. <hi>Pilate</hi> hereupon takes him in into his Judgement Hall [for hitherto the Jews conference and his had been at his gate] and questions him upon this point, and <hi>Iesus</hi> plainly confesseth that he was a King, but his Kingdom not of this world [and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he needed not from him to fear any prejudice to the <hi>Romane</hi> power] and so well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies <hi>Pilate,</hi> that he brings him out to the gate again, where the Jews stood, and profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that he found no fault in him at all.

This day was a very high day, of their appearance in Temple and their <hi>Chagigah</hi> [as we touched before] and in the morning they durst not go into <hi>Pilates</hi> Palace for fear of defiling, and lest they should be prevented of these great devotions, and yet the day is thus farre spent, and nothing done but only they have purchased the shedding of so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent blood.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Iohn</hi> in this passage laies two visible scruples before us: <hi>Quest.</hi> 1. How is it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reconcile him and <hi>Mark</hi> together, when <hi>Mark</hi> saith, <hi>It was the third hour and they crucified him,</hi> Mark 15.25. whereas he tels us, <hi>It was the sixth hour when Pilate deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him up?

If we cast up in our thoughts how many things were done this day before his nailing to his Crosse, it cannot be imaginable that they were all done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>third hour</hi> of the day. The <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> meet, sit in Counsell, examine the Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and vote him guilty; Bring him to <hi>Pilates</hi> Palace, there have manifold canvasses with <hi>Pilate pro</hi> and <hi>contra</hi> about him; Bring him to <hi>Herod,</hi> where he is questioned about many things: his garments changed and gorgeous Robes put upon him, and sent back to <hi>Pilate</hi> again. Then a fresh canvasse about him or <hi>Barabbas</hi> to be released, and <hi>Pilate</hi> puts them to a three-times deliberation upon it. Then overcome with their importunity, washeth his hands, scourgeth him, and delivers him up to them to be abused. The souldiers lead him into the Hall, make a Crown of thorns, divest and vest him anew, and make sport with him at pleasure. <hi>Pilate</hi> again brings him forth, and anew seeks and labours his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease: brings him in again and enters a new serious examination of him, hearing men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his being <hi>the Son of God:</hi> Goes out again and labours all he can for his deliverance, but being taxed that then he could not be <hi>Cesars</hi> friend, he goes to the Bench and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally passeth sentence upon him, writes the title of his Crosse, the Jews in the mean while abusing him.

And much after the same manner of account that our Saviours six hours sufferings, from <hi>Pilates</hi> first giving him up, to his dying, are reckoned: So the 430 years of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing of the children of <hi>Israel</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> Exod. 12. are computed, namely, the one half before they came into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the other half after. <hi>Quest.</hi> 2. But it may justly move a second <hi>quaere,</hi> How <hi>Christ</hi> could be on his Crosse and darknesse begun from the sixth hour, as the other Evangelists record it, when <hi>Iohn</hi> saith that it was but <hi>about the sixth hour</hi> when <hi>Pilate</hi> delivered him up? Which words of <hi>Iohn</hi> as they raise the scruple, so they may give the answer: For it might very properly be said, and that according to the usuall speech of the Nation, that it was <hi>about the sixth hour,</hi> when the sixth hour was but now beginning, and by the time that it was compleated all that might be dispatched, that passed betwixt his sentencing and his being raised upon the Crosse.</p>

                  <p>Over his head was his cause written, in the expression of which the variety of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists shews their stile, and how where one speaks short another inlargeth, and what need of taking all together to make up the full story. <hi>Mark</hi> hath it, <hi>The King of the Iews. Luke, This is the King of the Iews. Matthew, This is Iesus the King of the Iews. Iohn, Iesus of Nazareth the King of the Iews:</hi> Where the main thing regarded is, that he was condemned for taking on him to be <hi>King of the Iews</hi> as they pretended, which was also pretended to be Treason against <hi>Cesar:</hi> and to this point all the Evangelists speak alike, and their variety is only in wording this for the readers understanding: and he that spake shortest spake enough to expresse the matter of his accusation: and the rest that speak larger are but a comment upon the same thing. The three tongues in which this was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Hebrew, Greek and Latine,</hi> are thus spoken of in Midras Tillin fol. 25. col. 4. <hi>R. Iocha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nan saith, There are three tongues. The Latine tongue for warre, The Greek tongue for speech, and the Hebrew for prayer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All sorts of people had followed him to the execution: Some openly wept for him and bewailed him, which was not a thing usuall in such cases. In the Talmudich Tract last cited <hi>fol.</hi> 46.2. there is this strange doctrine, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>They bewailed not him that went to be executed, but only mourned inwardly for him.</hi> And what think you was the reason? The Glosse tels you thus, <hi>They bewailed him not, because his disgrace might be his expiation:</hi> meaning, that whereas they accounted, that the more shame and punishment a condemned person suffered, the more these tended to his expiation, they therefore would not openly bewail him, for that would have been some honour to him, and so would have abated of his expiation; but none lamenting for him, it was the greater disgrace, and the greater the disgrace the better was his sinne [as they thought] expiated, and atoned for. This strange custom and opinion, doth set forth
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:59067:46"/>
this publick bewailing of <hi>Christ</hi> the more remarkably.</p>
                  <p>Others, when he was now raised upon his Crosse reviled him, among whom were the chief Priests, Scribes, and Elders: who had so little to do, or rather their malice so much as to attend the execution. They were at first in some hesitancy whether he would not deliver himself by miracle: but when they saw he did not, then they triumph and insult at no measure. Nay, the theeves that were crucified with him spared him not, for so <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> tell us, but at last one of them becomes a convert and receives assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of being that day with him in Paradise. [<gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>It may be, the darknesse now begun, in an extraordinary and dreadfull manner, was some means of working upon this thief for his conviction that <hi>Iesus</hi> was the <hi>Messias:</hi> For instantly upon his raising upon his Crosse, it was now <hi>the sixth hour</hi> or high Noon compleat; and the darknesse began, and continued till three a clock afternoon: the very space of time of the day that <hi>Adam</hi> lay in darknesse without the promise, from the time of his Fall till God came and revealed <hi>Christ</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p>By the Crosse stood the mother of <hi>Iesus</hi> now a widow, and as it seemeth, destitute of maintenance, therefore he commendeth her to the care and charge of his beloved Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>Iohn. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>About the ninth hour Jesus crieth out, <hi>Eli, Eli lama sabachthani,</hi> that is, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou left me?</hi> Not <hi>forsaken</hi> him, as to the feeling of any spirituall deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but why <hi>left</hi> to such hands and to such cruel usage? Some said hereupon <hi>he called Elias:</hi> but was this said in mockery? or indeed did they think his words <hi>Eli, Eli</hi> meant <hi>Elias?</hi> Two things might make them really think so: the unusualnesse of the word <hi>Eli</hi> or <hi>Elohi</hi> in their Syriack tongue, the word <hi>Mari</hi> being it by which they commonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed the sense of that. And 2. the common opinion and legends that they had of <hi>Elias</hi> his coming to comfort and resolve men in distresse and perplexity, of which their <hi>Talmuds</hi> give not a few examples.</p>
                  <p>Complaining of thirst he had vinegar given him, which having tasted, and feeling the pangs of death come upon him, he saith, <hi>It is finished,</hi> and giving up a great cry, and committing his spirit to God, he dieth [at the time of the evening sacrifice.] At which instant there was an earthquake which rent the rocks: and the vail of the Temple was then also rent in the middle: The Priest that offered incense that evening sacrifice time, could bring an amazed testimony of this, when he came forth. The renting of the rocks light in such a place as where were the graves of many Saints hewen out, which now were opened [and shewed the conquest over the grave] and at another earthquake at which <hi>Christs</hi> grave was opened on the morning of his resurrection, the mouldred bodies of these graves revived, and after his rising they came out of the graves also and came into <hi>the holy City.</hi> Observe that <hi>Matthew</hi> cals <hi>Ierusalem The holy City,</hi> when it hath now murdered <hi>Christ,</hi> chap. 27.53. How great a matter must it be that must unchurch a Nation?</p>
                  <p>The Centurion and the company present, at the sight of what strange things had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, return much affected and full of thoughts about what was done: As the evening grew on, the Jews desire and obtain that the legs of them might be broken so to hasten their end, that they might not hang on the Crosse all night. This dispatcheth the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent thief [howsoever it did the other] as we may conclude from the words of <hi>Christ</hi> that told him of being that day in Paradise: But <hi>Christ</hi> being dead already they brake no bone of him, but one with a spear pierceth him, and out of his side cometh water and blood distinct and discernable the one from the other.</p>

               <p>AS for the subsequence of this Section to the preceding, there can be no scruple, but it requires some heedfulnesse, to lay the story in it, in its proper currency, because of some seeming diversities in the four in their relating the story of it.</p>
               <p>The Lord of life was under death about 36 hours: and so long was that day wherein the Sun stood still in the time of <hi>Ioshua:</hi> as <hi>Kimchi</hi> saith, it is the acknowledgement of the Jews: on <hi>Iosh.</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christ</hi> himself calleth this space three daies and three nights, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.40. whereas it was but two nights and one whole day, and two small parts of two more. And yet herein he speaketh warrantably even by the known and allowed Dialect of the Nation. Both the <hi>Talmuds</hi> in the Treatise <hi>Shabbah per.</hi> 9. do dispute about the <hi>three daies</hi> that <hi>Israel</hi> separated from their wives before the giving of the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.15. and among other things they have these passages: <hi>R. Akibah made the day a <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> And so did R. Ismael. But this is a tradition, R. Eliezer ben Azariah saith, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is accounted as the whole.</hi> Observe these last words to the purpose that we are upon: Three naturall daies by this rule were three <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and any part of any of these, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as the whole of it.</p>
               <p>The Evangelists seem to differ somewhat in the mention of the time of the womens coming to the sepulcher. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> came <hi>while it was yet dark.</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew, <hi>when it began to dawn:</hi> whereas <hi>Mark</hi> saith, she and the other women came thither <hi>at Sunrising:</hi> All which together speak the story to the full to this tenour. That at the dawning, and while it was yet dark, the women as soon as they could see [at the least <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>] set out to go to the Sepulchre: and that was at the very instant of <hi>Christs</hi> rising, when there was a great earthquake and an Angel came and rolled away the stone. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> came from <hi>Bethany,</hi> from her brother <hi>Lazarus</hi> his house [if she came from her own home] and the other women were at their severall lodgings, and to get them all together [for they were to go about this work all together] would spend some time: so that though <hi>Mary</hi> were so early stirring, yet before they were all got together to the Sepulchre it was Sunrising. These women little knew of the watch that was set over the grave, and the sealing of the stone [which was done on the morning of the Sabbath] for all their care is how to get the stone rolled away. When they come there, they finde that done already [and the watch was fled] and the Angel that had rolled it away sitting on it on the right hand of the entring in, and when they were entred in they saw another Angel, which both told them of his being risen. And thus <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> that men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but one Angel, are to be reconciled to <hi>Luke</hi> who speaketh of two.</p>
               <p>The women return and tell the Disciples what they had seen, <hi>but their words seemed to them as idle tales:</hi> yea <hi>Mary</hi> her self yet beleeved not that he was risen: It is worth stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dying upon the faith of the Disciples: it was a saving faith in <hi>Christ,</hi> and yet they belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not that he should die till he was dead, nor beleeved that he should rise again, no not when he was now risen.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> runne to the Sepulchre, and <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> follows them: They see the body gone and the clothes lying there [and <hi>Iohn</hi> proves the first that beleeves his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection] and they return home, but <hi>Mary</hi> staies there weeping still: And looking in, she sees two Angels, the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body had lain [like the two <hi>Cherubins</hi> at either end of the Ark:] And looking behinde her she seeth <hi>Iesus,</hi> and thought it had been the Gardiner, but presently knew him, and comes away to bring the Disciples word. Here <hi>Matthew</hi> speaks short: for he mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but one journey of the women to the grave and back, and saith that as they came back <hi>Iesus</hi> met them. Whereas <hi>Mary</hi> had two journeys, and it was she alone that met
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:59067:47"/>
him, and that in her second return. As she returned now the watchmen are come into the City, and bribed to deny that he was risen, and so the chief Priests and Elders give money to hire the Nation into unbelief.</p>

Because all they if they had not seen the thunders and lightnings and fire, and the mountains trembling, and the sound of the Trumpet, they would not have received the Law: but a proselyte though he see none of these things, yet he comes and gives up himself to God, and takes upon him the Kingdom of heaven.</hi>

               <p>CHRIST before his death had told them of his meeting with them in <hi>Galilee</hi> after his resurrection: and when he was risen, he appoints them to a mountain there. They are now come up into the Countrey, and while they wait the time of his appointment, <hi>Peter</hi> and six other of the Apostles go a fishing: not as their trade now, for they never had been all of them fishers before, but either for a present supply of provision for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or for present imployment till their Master should dispose of them. He had at first revealed himself to three of these seven [nay four, if <hi>Andrew</hi> were here] by a miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous draught of fishes, and so he doth to them all now: and who can tell whether they had not some thoughts of that, and some expectation of the like appearing now, which did the rather urge them to this work?</p>
               <p>At sea he helpeth them to a marvailous draught of 153 great fishes [so many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands were the proselytes that wrought for the Temple, only 600 over, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 2.17.] and at land he had provided them a dinner against they came ashore, and dines with them. And <hi>this,</hi> saith <hi>Iohn, was the third time that he shewed himself to his Disciples:</hi> which asserts the order of this Section, and sheweth that this was before his appearing to the whole number at the mountain where he had appointed them: The two times that he had appeared to them before this, this Evangelist giveth account of before, namely one time when <hi>Thomas</hi> was not present, and another time when he was.</p>
               <p>After dinner he putteth <hi>Peter</hi> to a threefold confession, answerable to his threefold deniall, and foretelleth his Martyrdom, but telleth that <hi>Iohn</hi> should live <hi>till he should come:</hi> meaning in that sense, as his coming and coming in glory is oft used in the Gospel, namely his coming to take vengeance of the unbelieving Jewish Nation: <hi>Peter</hi> should be Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred by them, but <hi>Iohn</hi> should live to see them receive their deserts.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Discipling</hi> was not of persons already taught, but to that end that they should be taught, and if the Disciples understood this word in <hi>Christs</hi> command after any other sense, it was different from the sense of the word, which the Nation had ever used and only used: For in their Schools a person was made <gap reason="foreign">

That sense there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that many put upon these words, <hi>viz.</hi> that none are to be baptized but those that are throughly taught, is such a one as the Apostles and all the Jewish Nation had never known or heard of before.</p>
               <p>That wretched and horrid opinion that denieth the Godhead of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of <hi>the holy Ghost,</hi> little observeth, or at least will not see why the administration of Baptism among the Gentiles must be in the Name of <hi>the Father, Sonne and holy Ghost,</hi> whereas among the Jews it was only in the Name of <hi>Iesus,</hi> Act. 2.38. namely for this reason, that as by that among the Jews, <hi>Iesus</hi> was to be professed for the true <hi>Messias</hi> against all other, so by this among the Gentiles who had worshipped false Gods, <hi>The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Sonne and holy Ghost</hi> should be professed the only true God. And it would be but a wild, as well as an irreligious Paraphrase that that opinion would make of this passage, <hi>Go preach the Gospel to every creature,</hi> and Baptize them in the Name of the Son a creature, and the holy Ghost a creature.</p>
               <p>He promiseth the miraculous gifts of the holy Ghost to them that should beleeve: [not to all, but to some for the confirmation of the Doctrine:] and chargeth the Disciples to return to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and there to stay till he should pour down the holy Ghost upon them,

                  <p>After the appearing to above five hundred Brethren at once, which we suppose and not without ground to have been that last mentioned, the Apostle relateth that <hi>he was seen of Iames,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.7. <hi>and then of all the Apostles:</hi> which doth plainly rank this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance to <hi>Iames</hi> between that to the five hundred Brethren on the mountain in <hi>Galilee,</hi> and his coming to all the Apostles when they were come again to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Which <hi>Iames</hi> this was, <hi>Paul</hi> is silent of, as all the Evangelists are, of any such particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. It is most like he means <hi>Iames the lesse,</hi> of whom he speaks oft elsewhere, and so doth the story of the Acts of the Apostles as one of specialler note in the time of <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching among the Gentiles. We reade oft in the Gospels, of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> three Disciples of singular eminency in regard of the privacy that <hi>Christ</hi> vouchsafed to them at some speciall times, more then to the other Apostles, and in that he badged them with a peculiar mark of changing their names, and did not so by any of the other. But that <hi>Iames</hi> was the sonne of <hi>Zebedee:</hi> Now when he was Martyred, <hi>Act.</hi> 12. you finde that <hi>Iames the sonne of Alpheus</hi> called <hi>Iames the lesse,</hi> came to be ranked in the like dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> and was Minister of the Circumcision, in speciall manner with them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.9. they to the Jews scattered abroad, and he residentiary in <hi>Iudea.</hi> See <hi>Act.</hi> 15.13. &amp; 21.18. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.13. If we question how he of all the rest of the Apostles came in, to make up that triumvirate when the other <hi>Iames</hi> was gone, we cannot tell where so pregnantly to give an answer as from hence; in that <hi>Christ</hi> vouchsafed thus par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to appear to him, which was not only an argument, but might carry the virtue of a command, to bring him into that rank, Office and Imployment, when the other <hi>Iames</hi> had run his course.</p>

The <hi>Ierus.

                  <p>As the confusion of tongues at <hi>Babel</hi> had caused the casting off of the Gentiles, by severing them from the participation of the true Religion [which was only professed and known in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue] so was the gift of tongues, to be a needfull means, to bring them in to Religion again; when every one may hear of the things of God in his own language. The Disciples were doubly indowed by this gift, as to the matter of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; for they were hereby inabled to speak to every Nation in their own tongue; and not that only, but they were inabled to understand the <hi>Originals</hi> of Scripture, which they understood not before. Their birth and breeding had not allowed them so much learning as to understand any Bible that was then extant, either <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Greek,</hi> but here is the first operation of this gift of the Spirit upon them, that they are first made able to understand the Originals of Scripture, and then able to unlock them to any one in their own tongue. And here should they begin that take on them to expound the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures by the Spirit, namely to unlock the difficulties of the Originall languages, [for therein the mainest difficulty of the Scripture lodgeth] according as was the method of the Spirits operation in the Apostles.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pentecost</hi> was a time of rejoycing, and at all such festivities the Jews had ever good store of wine stirring: so that these men conclude that they had drunk too much and spake as men distract: which <hi>Peter</hi> confutes by telling them it was <hi>not yet the third hour of the day,</hi> or nine a clock. For upon their Sabbaths and holidaies they used not to eat or drink till their Synagogue service was done. <hi>Maym. in Schab.</hi> per. 30. which was not of a good while after nine a clock.</p>
                  <p>His alleadging of <hi>Ioel, In the last daies I will pour out my Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. teacheth us how to construe the phrase, <hi>The last daies,</hi> in exceeding many places both of the Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the New, as <hi>Isa.</hi> 2.1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. &amp; 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.7. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 2.19, &amp;c.

For the form of Baptism in those first daies of the Gospel, of which the New Testament giveth the story, may be considered under a threefold condition. 1. <hi>Iohn the Baptist</hi> baptized in the Name of <hi>Messias,</hi> or <hi>Christ</hi> that was then ready to come, but that <hi>Iesus of Nazareth</hi> was he, he himself knew not till he had run a good part of his course, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.31. as was observed before. 2. The Disciples baptizing the Jews, baptized them <hi>in the Name of Iesus:</hi> upon this reason, because the great point of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie then in the Nation about <hi>Messias</hi> was, Whether <hi>Iesus of Nazareth</hi> were he or no. All the Nation acknowledged a <hi>Messias,</hi> but the most of them abominated that <hi>Iesus of Nazareth</hi> should be thought to be he: therefore those that by the preaching of the Gospel came to acknowledge him to be <hi>Messias,</hi> were baptized into his Name, as the criticall badge of their imbracing the true <hi>Messias.</hi> But 3. among the Gentiles where that question was not afoot, they baptized <hi>in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost.</hi> And so that baptizing <hi>in the Name of Iesus,</hi> was for a season for the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the evidence of his being <hi>Messias,</hi> and when that was throughly established, then it was used no more, but Baptism was in the Name <hi>of the Father, and Son,</hi> &amp;c. Of the same cognizance were those extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, evidences of <hi>Iesus</hi> his being the <hi>Messias,</hi> and means of conveying the Gospel through the world, and when both these were well established, then those gifts ceased for ever.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All that beleeved were together and had all things common,</hi> ver. 46. The children of those that beleeved, must come under the title of <hi>Beleevers</hi> too, or they must famish. For this community of goods being for the relief of the poor, as we shall shew at the fourth Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, the children, babes and infants of beleeving parents that were poor, must be taken in under this expression, <hi>All that beleeved,</hi> &amp;c. or how did they for support? If the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of goods reacht them as well as their parents, the title must reach them too: When a Master of a family was baptized, his children were they never so young were baptized with him, and hence the mention of baptizing <hi>whole housholds,</hi> Act. 16.15.33. They that pleading against Infants Baptism, do cavill, that it may be, there were no Infants in those families that are mentioned, bewray that they little understand the manner of administring Baptism in its first use. For the stress of the business lies not in this; whether it can be proved that there were Infants in those families, where it is recorded, that <hi>whole housholds were baptized,</hi> but the case is this, that in all families whatsoever, were there never so many Infants, they were all baptized, when their parents were baptized. Thus was the constant custom among the Jews for admission of Proselytes, and thence this Canon, <hi>That a woman proselyted and baptized when she was great with child, her childe need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not then to be baptized when it was born.</hi> Maym. in Issure biah per. 13. For if he had been born before she was baptized, he must have been baptized with her. And the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament gives so little evidence of the altering this custom, at those first baptizings under the Gospel, that it plainly on the contrary shews the continuance of it, when it speaketh of the Apostles baptizing <hi>whole housholds.</hi>

Why? What could be added to them they having been so filled with the holy Ghost before? In their prayer they petitioned these two things, That God would give them boldnesse to speak his Word, and that Healings and Signes and Wonders might be done in the Name of <hi>Iesus:</hi> And the power of both these fals now upon them: and especially, it may be conceived that Wonder of Wonders, upon the twelve, power to bestow the holy Ghost.</p>

                     <hi>The community of goods,</hi> with the mention of which the second and the fourth Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pters conclude, may be considered under these two animadversions: 1. That although persecution as yet for the Gospel, had brought none to poverty, yet it is manifest that there were poor amongst them. And some come to the more poverty for the Gospel sake too. For if they were poor before they received the Gospel, then the Synagogue of which they were provided for them: but now they were destitute of that provision, they having forsaken the Synagogue; or at the least the Synagogue them, because of their forsaking of their Judaism. For the Evangelicall Church therefore, that was now begun, to provide for her poor, it had not only the Synagogue for an example, but would have had it for a reproach, if they had neglected so needfull a duty, which that took care for so constantly and tenderly. 2. This having of all things common therefore, was not an extinction of propriety and of <hi>meum &amp; tuum,</hi> as if one rich man should have as good interest in another rich mans estate as himself, but it was intended mainly for the relief of the poor: Not to bring any that had estates to voluntary poverty, nor to levell estates, but to releeve those which stood in need. <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.45. &amp; 4.35.

Now the sinne of this couple was first coveteousnesse, but especially presuming to play false, and yet thinking to go undiscovered of that Spirit which wrought so powerfully in the Apostles. That cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed opinion that denies the Godhead of the holy Ghost, runs parallel with this sinne of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> to a hair.</p>

                     <hi>Peters</hi> warrant for this execution we may reade in that passage, <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.22, 23. <hi>He breathed on them and said, Receive ye the holy Ghost, whose sins ye remit they are remitted, and whose sins ye retain they are retained.</hi> How? To forgive sins absolutely? this belongs only to God. Was it to forgive them declaratively? This seems too low a construction, and too re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained: It seemeth therefore the most proper meaning of this donation, that he now indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with power, to avenge what sins the holy Ghost [now received] should direct them, to avenge, with bodily plagues, giving up to Satan, or with death: and again to remit such penalties as they should be directed to remit, and they should be remitted. The holy Ghost whom they had received then with so peculiar a power, <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> do here plainly vilifie, and affront directly; therefore an execution of such power upon them was as proper and direct. But be it whether it will, that <hi>Peter</hi> took his warrant originally from thence, or had it instantly by some immediate revelation, as the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:59067:51"/>
was fearfull, so his executing of it was remarkable, shewing at once his assurance of the pardon of his own lying against his Master, when he can and dare thus avenge a lye against the holy Ghost: and also his just zeal and activity for the honour of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster whom he had denied.</p>
                  <p>It is said in <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>They were all in Solomons porch,</hi> which was the East cloister of the mount of the Temple, and in part of it did the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> now sit, and the Apostles not afraid to act so near them: But at last they are apprehended and imprisoned, but mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously inlarged, and preaching in the Temple again: and thereupon convented before the Councill. <hi>Gamaliel, Pauls</hi> master was now President, and continued in this dignity till within eighteen years of the destruction of the City.

even miraculously, before he pleadeth his own cause, by his face shining like the face of <hi>Moses,</hi> and bearing an Angelicall aspect and Majesty; for indeed he spake but what was spoken by the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> Dan. 9.26, 27.</p>
                  <p>In his Apology, he speaketh to the heads of his accusation, but somewhat abstrusely; yet so as to them to whom he spake to be well understood, his discourse being according to their own Rhetorick and Logick: To what was laid to his charge, for vilifying <hi>Moses,</hi> and saying, his customs should be changed, he rehearseth in brief the whole history of <hi>Moses,</hi> and shews he was Orthodox to him; but yet he driveth all to this, that as the times before <hi>Moses</hi> were still moving and growing on to settlement in <hi>Moses,</hi> so when <hi>Moses</hi> himself had setled all he had to do, yet he pointed them to a Prophet yet to come, to whom they should hearken as the ultimate Oracle, which was this <hi>Iesus</hi> that he preached to them.

As, that their fathers had persecuted those that fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told of <hi>Christ,</hi> as they did him for now preaching him, and they followed their fathers steps; nay went further, for they had murdered <hi>Christ,</hi> whereas their fathers had but murdered his Prophets. And whereas they were so punctuall, about the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious rites given by <hi>Moses,</hi> they neglected the morall Law, which was given by the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of Angels.</p>
                  <p>This cuts them to the heart, that they passe a rancourous and furious sentence of death upon him: but he hath a sight of the high bench of heaven, God and Christ at his right hand, their judge and his: A most fit prospect for the first Martyr.</p>

Rabban Gamaliel saith, All the Ordinances that the Cuthaeans use, they are more punctuall in them then Israel is.</hi> It is an unhappy obscurity that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Writers have put upon the word <hi>Cuthaeans,</hi> for though it most properly signifie <hi>Samaritans,</hi> yet have they so commonly given this name to <hi>Christians,</hi> as the most odious name they could invent to give them, that in the most places that you meet with it, you cannot tell whether they mean the one or the other. In the place cited, it seemeth indeed most likely that it means the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it speaks of their keeping the feast of unleavened bread, and using the Ordinances of <hi>Israel:</hi> unlesse it speak of those Jews that had received the Gospel and become Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and were fallen to their Judaism again, and joyned that with their Christianity, which very many did, as we shall have occasion to observe hereafter.</p>

                  <p>We finde all along this Book, that the chief Priests are not only the busiest men in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuting of the Gospel, but in many places it is related so, as if they were the only men and had intire power in their own hands, as a peculiar Court, to give Commissions, to judge, condemn and execute: as it hath been and is the opinion of some, that there was an Ecclesiasticall <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> distinct from the Civil.</p>
                  <p>It is true indeed that there was in the Temple a Consistory only of Priests, which sat in the room called <hi>Parhedrin,</hi> and <hi>Liscath Bulente, The Chamber of the Council:</hi> but these sate not there, as Magistrates over the people, but only as a Consistory, to take care of the service and affairs of the Temple, that nothing should be wanting, nor no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing slacked that was required about it, or that conduced to the promoting of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of it, and their power extended not beyond that virge. Any other <hi>Concessus</hi> or Consistory of <hi>Priests alone,</hi> then this, I beleeve cannot be shewed in any records of that Nation, and this is far from the power and constitution of a <hi>Sanhedrin.</hi> The Talmud in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in <hi>Chetuhboth per.</hi> 1. <hi>Halac.</hi> 5. speaketh of a <hi>Beth din, or Consistory of the Priests which required</hi> 400 <hi>zuzims in dower or joynture for a virgin:</hi> Which seemeth to assert this as a peculiar Court, invested with distinct power from the other. But the <hi>Gomarists,</hi> espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the <hi>Babylonian</hi> do make it plain, that no such thing can be inferred from this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for they tell us that the Priests determined this businesse of 400 <hi>zuzims dower to their own daughters,</hi> only for the honour of their Tribe and blood: So that this was not any act of judiciall power binding others, but an act of consent among themselves to keep up the credit of their Function and Families. But here is not time and place to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusse this point [a matter of no small Controversie] further then what may give illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration to the subject before us.</p>
                  <p>How to understand therefore this judiciall activity of the <hi>chief Priests</hi> throughout this book, the Evangelist hath given us a rule betime in the story, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 5. Where he shews that the whole <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> is to be understood, of which the Priests were a great, if not the greatest part, and were in this cause the busiest men. In case of necessity, there might be a <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> though never a Priest or Levite was of it, for so is their own Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, namely if fit men of either rank were not to be found; but in common carriage, and experience they were the greatest and most potent number, as whose profession and Function bespake studiousnesse and pleaded honour.

And <hi>Lod</hi> or <hi>Lydda</hi> they speak exceeding frequently of, and produce remarkable stories and memorials of it. And indeed the quarters of <hi>Peters</hi> present walk, compared with the Hebrews records concerning these places, may well claim some observation. For when he is at <hi>Ioppa</hi> he is in the middle, as it were, of those places which in a little time after this [nay it may be at this very time] were two of their greatest and eminentest Schools.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Iabneh</hi> on the one hand of <hi>Ioppa</hi> did the great <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> sit long: both before the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and after: for when it began to be unsetled and to flit up and down fourty years before the destruction of the City, its first removall from <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was hither: and here sat <hi>Gamaliel, Pauls</hi> Master, with his <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> a good space of time, and for ought can be said to the contrary, it might very well be there at this time when <hi>Peter</hi> was at <hi>Ioppa.</hi>

                  <p>Now as the Jews called that place <hi>Iabneh</hi> so the Gentiles called it <hi>Iamnia,</hi> and how neer it was to <hi>Ioppa</hi> you may guesse from these words of <hi>Strabo,</hi> lib. 16. <hi>This place</hi> [speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Ioppa] was so populous that out of the neighbour Town Iamnia, and other places there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>about, it was able to raise</hi> 40000 <hi>men.</hi>

For they might not intercalate the year but in <hi>Iudea,</hi> Maym. in Kiddush Hedesh per. 4. but upon this mischance they removed that businesse into <hi>Galilee.</hi> Here it seems the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> sat also sometimes, or at least they had a great Bench of their own, for there is mention of <hi>stoning ben Satda at Lydda on the eve of the Passeover,</hi> Ibid. fol. 25.4. To reckon the stories and eminent men belonging to this place were endlesse, at the least it is needlesse here.</p>
                  <p>But the mention and gender of <hi>Saron</hi> which is also named with <hi>Lydda,</hi> Act. 9.35. may plead excuse if we alledge one or two Talmudich passages for the clearing of it, Jerus. in Sheviith fol. 38.4. <hi>From Bethoron to Emmaus was hilly: from Emmaus to Lydda plain, and from Lydda to the sea vale.</hi>

And those that spake with Tongues in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. For to what purpose was it for them to speak there with Tongues where they all understood the same Language? It was not to gibber and talk in strange Language that men might admire but not understand, but it was for edification of others, yea and for edifying of himself that so spake, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.4. <hi>He that speaketh a tongue edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth himself</hi>: How? what could he speak in any strange Language to his own edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he might not as much edifie himself by, had he spoken it in his own native tongue? But only that this is meant, his ability by the gift of tongues, to understand and speak the Originall language of the Scripture, was both for his own edification and the edification of others. Suppose one in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> could speak <hi>Persick, Arabick, Ethiopick,</hi> &amp;c. and did chatter these Languages among them; he could not possibly speak any thing in those Tongues [though interpreted] that could edifie the people any more, then if he spake it in his mother tongue: But if he spake and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood and uttered the Originall language of Scripture, that if interpreted, would edifie: and he could not speak in his mother tongue, unlesse taken from thence, what he might speak thence.</p>

But about this we need not much to trouble our selves: since as to the understanding of the stories themselves, there can be little illustration taken from their time: save only as to this, that the publick Fast in the Church of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch,</hi> may seem to have some relation to some of the sad stories mentioned before, as coincident with them, or near to them; namely, either the famine through the world, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.28. or the Persecution in the Church, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. We shall not therefore offer to dislocate the order of the stories, from that wherein they he, the Holy Ghost by the intertexture of them rather teaching us, that some of them were contemporary; then any way incouraging us to invert their order. Only these things cannot passe unmenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, toward the stating of their time and place, partly of coincidency, and partly of their succeeding one the other, and which may help us better to understand both.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That whereas <hi>Dion</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Historian <hi>lib.</hi> 60. hath placed a sore famine [at least at <hi>Rome</hi>] in the time of <hi>Claudius,</hi> in his second year: <hi>Iosephus</hi> carries it, <hi>Antiq. lib.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. as if the bitternesse of it at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> were in his fourth, which <hi>Euseb. in Chron.</hi> determines positively; both may be true; for, for famines to last severall years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is no strange thing in History, Divine or Humane, nor in experience in our own age.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That <hi>Herod Agrippa</hi>'s murdering of <hi>Iames,</hi> and imprisoning of <hi>Peter</hi> could not be before the third year of <hi>Claudius:</hi> for <hi>Iosephus</hi> a witnesse impartiall enough in this case, informs us, that <hi>Claudius</hi> in his second Consulship, which was indeed the second year of his reign, made an Edict in behalf of the Jews, and sent it through the world, and after that sent <hi>Agrippa</hi> away into his own Kingdom: Now his Consulship beginning the first of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> it was so next impossible that those things should be done at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Agrippa</hi> provide for his journey and travell it, and come to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and murder <hi>Iames</hi> and apprehend <hi>Peter,</hi> and all before the Passeove, unlesse he hasted as it had been for a wager, that he that can believe <hi>Peter</hi> to have been imprisoned in <hi>Claudius</hi> his second year of Consulship and reign, must exceedingly straiten the time of these occurrences, to make room for his belief.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the third year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> therefore, are those stories in <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. to be repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; only the last, about <hi>Herods</hi> death, in the beginning of his fourth, for a Passeover in his fourth <hi>Herod</hi> lived not to see.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It may be observed that <hi>Luke</hi> hath placed the going up of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> with the alms of the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> to the poor of <hi>Iudea,</hi> before the murder of <hi>Iames, Chap.</hi> 11.30. but their return thence, not till after that, and <hi>Herods</hi> death, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.25. not that thereupon we are necessarily to think that they staid there so long, as while all those things in <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. were acting, but that by that relation the story of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> is begun again, and we may very well conceive, for all that <hi>postscript</hi> of <hi>Luke</hi> after the story of <hi>Iames</hi> his Martyrdom, <hi>Peters</hi> imprisonment, and <hi>Agrippa</hi>'s death, their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>Antioch,</hi> and going from thence among the Gentiles, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. to have been at that time while some of the things in <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. occurred.</p>

                  <p>There were now in the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> five men which were both <hi>Prophets and Teachers,</hi> or which did not only instruct the people and expound the Scriptures, but had also the Prophetick spirit and were partakers of Revelations: For though <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> were indeed of a distinct notion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.11. and their abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to teach were accordingly of a distinct originall, namely the former by revelation, and the latter by study, yet <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, [which phrase may not passe without observation] according to the state of the Church then being, they not only had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Teachers, but there was a kinde of necessity they should have such, till time and study had inabled others to be Teachers, which as yet they could not have attained unto, the Gospel having been so lately brought among them.</p>
                  <p>Among these five, the names of <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul</hi> are no strangers to the Reader, but the other three are more unknown.</p>

                  <p>As these holy men were at the publick ministration with fasting and prayer, the Holy Ghost gives them advertisement of the separating of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry among the Gentiles.

                  <p>The Romish glossaries would fain strain <hi>the Masse</hi> out of the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and the <hi>Rhemists</hi> think they have done us a courtesie, that they have not translated it to that sense: whereas, besides that the word naturally signifieth any publick ministration, the Holy Ghost by the use of it seemeth to have a speciall aim, namely to intimate to us, that this was a publick fast, as well as another publick ministration. Publick fasts were not ordinary services, and they were not taken up but upon extraordinary occasions, and what the present occasion might be, had been a great deal better worth studying upon, then how to make the Greek word speak <hi>the Masse</hi> which it never meant.</p>
                  <p>How publick fastings and daies of humiliation were used by the Jews, and upon what occasions, there is a speciall Treatise in the <hi>Talmud</hi> upon that subject, called <hi>Taanith,</hi> and the like in <hi>Maymony,</hi> that beareth witnesse: and it was no whit unsutable to the Gospel, upon the like exigencies to use the like kinde of service and devotion: And the present famine that was upon all Countries might very well minister occasion to this Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> at this present for such a work, for we cannot but suppose that the famine was now in being.</p>
                  <p>Whatsoever the occasion was, the Lord, in the midst of their humiliation, pointeth out <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> for an imployment of his own, who were but a while ago re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from an imployment of the Churches: And so the other three <hi>Simeon, Lucius,</hi> and <hi>Menaen,</hi> understanding what the Lord meant, and having used another solemn day in fasting in prayer, lay their hands upon them and set them apart by Ordination. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as the ordaining of Elders among the Jews was by a <hi>Triumvirate,</hi> or by <hi>three Elders.</hi> Sanhedr. per. 1. halac. 3.</p>
                  <p>This is the second Imposition of hands since the Gospel began, which did not confer the Holy Ghost with it [for these two were full of the Holy Ghost before:] and this is the first Ordination of Elders since the Gospel, that was used out of the Land of <hi>Israel.</hi> Which rite the Jewish Canons would confine only to that Land. <hi>Maym.</hi> Sanhedr. per. 4. Which circumstances well considered, with the imployment that these two were to go about, and this manner of their sending forth, no better reason I suppose can be given of this present action, then that the Lord hereby did set down a platform of ordaining Ministers in the Church of the Gentiles to future times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> thus designed by the Lord and ordained and sent forth by this <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirate</hi> and guided by the Holy Ghost, they first go to <hi>Seleucia:</hi> most likely <hi>Seleucia Pieriae,</hi> of which <hi>Strabo</hi> saith, that <hi>it is the first City of Syria from Cilicia,</hi> Geogr. lib. 14. to which <hi>Pliny</hi> assenteth, when he measureth <hi>the breadth of Syria, from Seleucia Pieriae to Zeugma upon Euphrates,</hi> Nat. hist. lib. 5. cap. 12. The reason of their going thither may be judged to be, that they might take ship for <hi>Cyprus,</hi> whither they intended, for that this was a Port, appeareth by what follows in <hi>Strabo,</hi> when he saith, <hi>That from Seleucia to Soli is about a thousand furlongs sail:</hi> and so it is plain in <hi>Lukes</hi> text when he saith, <hi>they departed unto Seleucin, and from thence they sailed to Cyprus</hi>: where let us now follow them.</p>

                  <p>From thence they travailed preaching up and down in the Iland, till they come to <hi>Paphos</hi> which was at the very further part of it, toward the Southwest Angle.

It may be answered, By former converse with them in the City, and it is very like that the Rulers themselves had drunk in some affection to the Gospel by converse with them, which made them so ready to urge them to preach: For it is not imaginable that this was the first time that they had seen them: nor that they came to Town that very day, but that they had had some converse before.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">CLAVDIVS. </seg>X</label> WE are now come up to the Council at <hi>Hierusalem.</hi> The occasion of which was the busie stirring of some, who would have brought the yoke of <hi>Mosaick</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servances upon the neck of the converted Gentiles. Multitudes of the Jews that beleeved, yet were zealous of the Law, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.20. and it was hard to get them off from those Rites, in which they had been ever trained up, and which had been as it were an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to them from their fathers: This bred this disturbance at the present, and in time an Apostacy from the Gospel of exceeding many. Antiquity hath held that <hi>Cerinthus</hi> was the chief stickler in this businesse; but whosoever it was that kindled it, it was a spark enough to have fired all had it not been timely prevented.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> who had chiefly to deal in the ministration to the Gentiles, are sent from <hi>Antioch</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to consult the Apostles about this matter. This is the same journey and occasion that is spoken of <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. <hi>Then fourteen years after I went up again to Ierusalem with Barnabas and took Titus with me. And I went up by revelation,</hi> &amp;c. Not but that he was sent by the Church as <hi>Luke</hi> hath asserted here, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. but that the Church was directed by revelation to take this course for the setling of the question, namely to send up to the Apostles at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> And hence we may fix the time of this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, if it be resolved from whence the beginning of these fourteen years is to be dated, namely whether he mean fourteen years after his first conversion, or fourteen after his former journey to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> mentioned <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.18. which he took three years after his conversion. The later is the more undoubted, upon these two observations. 1. It were
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:59067:59"/>
exceeding obscure, and is exceeding unagreeable to Scripture accounting, to reckon the later summe of fourteen years from the time of his conversion, and not from the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or time that went next before, which was his being at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> three years after he was converted. 2. His scope in that his discourse is, not to shew barely what journeys he took to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> after his conversion, but to shew how long he preached among the Gentiles and abroad out of <hi>Iudea</hi> time after time, and yet when he came to the Apostles to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> they found no fault with him, nor with the course he took in his Ministry. After I was converted I went not to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to consult the Apostles, but went into <hi>Arabia,</hi> and back again to <hi>Damascus,</hi> and so preached up and down, one utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known by face to the Apostles; yet when after three years thus doing I came up to <hi>Peter</hi> the Minister of the Circumcision, he was so farre from contrarying the course that I had gone, that he gave me fifteen daies entertainment. And after that time I went through <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Cilicia,</hi> and abroad among the Gentiles, yet after fourteen years imployment in this kinde, when I went up to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> again, I found fair respect with the Apostles and they gave me the right hand of fellowship. This drift of the Apostle being observed in that place, which cannot be denied, if his main purpose through the whole Epistle be observed, it evidently stateth the time of this journey to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to be seventeen years after his conversion.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> came to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> they applied themselves <note n="*" place="margin">

And this they did that they might clear themselves of all false rumours, that might be laid to their charge [as if they crossed the doctrine and minde of the Apostles] and that they might have their judgement and concurrence along with them. With <hi>Paul</hi> there was <hi>Titus,</hi> who hitherto had been uncircumcised, all along in his attending and accompanying <hi>Paul:</hi> and even now at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> though he were before the Apostles of the Circumcision, yet was he not forced to be circumcised there neither; because there were some false brethren who lay upon the catch to observe and scandall the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Gospel that the Apostles used, and they were unwilling to give way to them in any such condescension, least they should have wronged the Gospel. For though <hi>Paul</hi> allowed the Circumcision of <hi>Timothy,</hi> and though even these Apostles perswaded <hi>Paul</hi> to use some of the <hi>Mosaick</hi> ceremonies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Act.</hi> 21.24. for avoiding offence to the weak, and for the more winning of those that were well satisfied, yet would they not yield an inch in any such thing to these catchpoles that lay upon the lurch, to spy out something if it might have been whereby they might have disgraced the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>Well: the result of the Apostles conference is, that the three of the Circumsion, neither detracted from what the two of the uncircumsion had done already, nor added any more things to be done by them hereafter: But they agree that <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> should go to the Heathen, and they themselves to the Circumcision: desiring only that though they went among the Gentiles, yet they would remember the poor of the Circumcision, which they consented to, and all was well concluded betwixt them.</p>
                  <p>But they that urged for the imposition of <hi>Moses</hi> his yoke would not be so satisfied, but the matter must come to a publick canvasse, and so the Elders also met together with those Apostles to consider of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Peter</hi> would have none of <hi>Moses</hi> burdens laid upon the Gentiles, because he himself had seen them to have been partakers of the holy Ghost, in as free and full a measure, as they had been that had been most <hi>Mosaicall. Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> affirmed that they had seen the like, and therefore what needed the Gentiles to be troubled with these observan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, seeing they were so eminent in gifts of the Spirit as well as they of the Circumcision and what could these adde to them. But <hi>Iames</hi> findeth out a temper betwixt those that would have all these yokes imposed, and those that would have none, that so the Jews might have the lesse offence, and the Gentiles no burden neither. And that was, that the Gentiles might be required to refrain from eating things offered to Idols, and strangled, and blood, and fornication. The three first were now become things indifferent [how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever strictly they had been imposed by the Law before] <hi>Christ</hi> having by his death done down the partition wall, and laid these things aside as uselesse when there was to be no distinction of meats or Nations any more: yet because the Jews were so glewed to these things that the tearing of them away suddenly, would in a manner have fetched up skin
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:59067:59"/>
and flesh and all, therefore the whole Councill upon the motion of <hi>Iames</hi> think it fit that the Gentiles should thus farre Judaize, till time and fuller acquaintance with the Gospel might make both Jews and Gentiles to lay these now needlesse niceties aside.</p>
                  <p>The Jews about these things had these Canons among many others.</p>

Not because it was indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as well as they: Nor because it was so very offensive to the Jews as were the other: for they made but little of fornication themselves, according to the common taking of the word <hi>fornication:</hi> but <hi>fornication</hi> here seemeth to translate their word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Before we part from this Councill, as it is commonly called, we may thus farre take notice of the nature of it as to observe, that it was not a convention premeditated, and solemnly summoned, but only occasionall and emergent, and that it was only of those Apostles and Elders that were at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> at the instant when the matter from <hi>Antioch</hi> was brought thither, and the other Apostles that were abroad were not fetched in, nor indeed needed any such thing: for the message from <hi>Antioch</hi> required not so much the number of voices, as the resolves of those Apostles that had especially to deal with the Circumcision: and whom the <hi>Antiochian</hi> Church doubted not to finde ready at <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The matter being determined, Letters are dispatched, with the Decrees, unto the Churches by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Silas:</hi> they come to <hi>Antioch</hi> and there abide a while: and at last go their severall waies, <hi>Iudas</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and <hi>Paul, Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> away among the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>It was the agreement between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> on the one party, and <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> on the other, that those two should go among the Gentiles, and these three

                  <p>They set forth and travell <hi>Phrygia</hi> and <hi>Galatia,</hi> and when they would have gone into <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Bithynia</hi> the Spirit forbad them, because the Lord would hasten them into <hi>Macedonia</hi> unto a new work, and such a one as they had not medled withall till now, and that was to preach to a <hi>Roman</hi> plantation, for so the text doth intimate that <hi>Philippi</hi> was, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. and <hi>ver.</hi> 21. and so saith <hi>Pliny,</hi> lib. 4. cap. 11. He had indeed been alwaies in the <hi>Roman</hi> dominions, but still among other Nations, as Jews, Greeks, Syrians and the like, but we reade not that he was in any City of Romans till here. And his going to preach to that people is so remarkable, that the text seemeth to have set two or three notable badges upon it. For that Nation lieth under so many sad brands in Scripture, and lay under so great an abominating by the Jews, that the Gospels entring among them, hath these three singular circumstances to advertise of it. 1. That the Spirit diverted <hi>Paul</hi> from <hi>Asia</hi> and <hi>Bithynia</hi> to hasten him thither. 2. That he was called thither by a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall vision, the like invitation to which he had not in all his travels to any other place. 3. The Penman doth not joyn himself in the story till this very time. For hitherto ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving spoken in the third person, <hi>he</hi> and <hi>they,</hi> as <hi>He came to Derbe,</hi> ver. 1. <hi>They went through the Cities,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he cometh now to joyn himself, and to use the word <hi>We</hi> and <hi>Vs.</hi> After he had seen the vision immediatly <hi>we</hi> indeavoured to go into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> assuredly gathering that the Lord had called <hi>us,</hi> ver. 10.</p>
                  <p>Yet was this City mixed also of abundance of <hi>Iews</hi> living among them, as that people was now dispersed and sowed in the most places of the Empire, from <hi>Rome</hi> it self Eastward, however it was on this side: On the Sabbath, by a river side where the women it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed used their bathings for purification, and where was a Synagogue, they preach and convert <hi>Lydia</hi> a proselytesse, and she is instantly baptized and her houshold before she go home, for ought can be found otherwise in the text: from whence we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve what beleeving gave admission to Baptism to whole housholds.

The time of its writing therefore was when <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> with him returned from <hi>Macedonia</hi> and came to <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Corinth,</hi> Act. 18.5. and <hi>Timothy</hi> who had been sent thither purposely, gives a comfortable account of their faith and constancy.

               <p>Besides outward molestation and affliction of their bodies, there were false teachers that troubled their mindes, and especially with these two puzzles. 1. To make them to doubt what became of them that died in the faith and profession of <hi>Iesus:</hi> for whereas the Apostle handles the matter of the resurrection in the former Epistle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.14. I cannot suppose that he doth it to them as to men of the <hi>Sadducee</hi> opinion, denying the resurrection, or as to men that had never heard of the resurrection before, for all the Jews, set the <hi>Sadduces</hi> aside, did assuredly believe it: but because that the opposers of the Gospel had buzzed to them their lost condition after death, for their revolting from the Jewish Religion, and becoming Apostates [as they reputed it] to the Gospel. The tenth Chapter of the Treatise <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> that names certain sorts of people that must not inherit the world to come, gives us good cause to suppose that this was no small terrour that those envious opposers would perplex the mindes of those withall, who had forsaken the Jewish Religion, and betaken themselves to the profession of Christ. The Talmudich place cited speaketh thus, <hi>All Israel hath a share in the world to come, as it is said, Thy people shall all of them be righteous: But these have no share in the world to come, He that saith, The resurrection is not taught in the Law, and that the Law is not from God, and Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus.</hi> Now by <hi>Epicurus</hi> they mean not <hi>luxurious one,</hi> as the word <hi>Epicure</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly used by us, but as the <hi>Gemara</hi> explains it there <gap reason="foreign">

The aim in this terrour was to amaze the new beleevers and to puzzle them about what to hold, and what to do in that sad time, which they pretended was ready to fall upon their heads.

                  <hi>He shall destroy the wicked Roman:</hi> And so the Apostle puts an <hi>Emphasis</hi> upon it, and translates it <hi>the Man of sin:</hi> And in that <hi>Christ</hi> is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the Prophet, as having a speciall quarrell and vengeance against him, he is called <hi>the son of perdition,</hi> or he that is so certainly and remarkably to be destroyed. It is true, this meaneth the <hi>Roman,</hi> as the <hi>Chaldee,</hi> and our Protestant Divines by the warrant of <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Revelation</hi> do interpret it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but in the first place and sense it meaneth the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Nation, which proved <hi>Antichrist,</hi> as well as <hi>Rome</hi> ever did, and as far as <hi>Rome</hi> ever did, and before <hi>Rome</hi> ever did, and as long and longer then <hi>Rome</hi> hath yet done. As <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Rome</hi> joyned in the murder of <hi>Christ,</hi> so are they joyned in this character of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> but the Jews to be understood first: See <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>the mystery of iniquity was already working</hi> when the Apostle wrote this Epistle, which cannot possibly be understood but of the Jewish Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so it is explained again and again, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.18. &amp; 4.3. &amp; 2 <hi>Ioh. v.</hi> 7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The severall characters that the Apostle gives of <hi>the Man of sinne,</hi> agree most throughly to that generation and Nation, and so the Scripture plainly applies them to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There was <hi>a falling away</hi> in that Nation of multitudes that had imbraced the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.12. <hi>Christ</hi> foretelling it, and <hi>Paul</hi> from thence, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. by <hi>the later times</hi> that he there speaks of, meaning the last daies of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and the Jewish state, as the phrase is used in that sense abundantly. Such apostacy may be observed hinted in the Epistle to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> to the <hi>Hebrews, Colossians, Rev.</hi> 2.4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. and to spare more, observe the conclusion of that Parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.43, 44, 45. <hi>So shall it be with this wicked generation.</hi> The devil once cast out of it by the Gospel, but returned by their Apostacy.</p>

But how they exalted themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst every thing <hi>called</hi> God, or the Magistracy and those that were set over them, we may observe in such passages as these, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10. <hi>They despise government,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iude</hi> v.8. <hi>They despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities,</hi> &amp;c. and in their own stories to endlesse examples.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As for the fourth mark mentioned, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. namely his <hi>coming after the working of Satan</hi> with all Magicall power and delusion, our Saviour had foretold is of that genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. compared with <hi>ver.</hi> 34. of that Chapter: and it is abundantly asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Scripture, by <hi>Iosephus,</hi> and other of their own Writers, as we have given some examples before.</p>
               <p>Now what the Apostle meaneth when he speaketh of one <hi>that letted [ver.</hi> 6. <hi>And now ye know what withholdeth,</hi> and <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>He who now letteth will let</hi>] is of some obscurity; we may without offence give this conjecture. As the term <hi>The day of the Lord,</hi> is taken in Scripture especially in this double sense, for <hi>his day of judging the Iewish Nation,</hi> and for <hi>his day of judging all the world</hi>; so are we to understand <hi>a falling away,</hi> and <hi>a Man of sin</hi> of the Jewish Nation before the former, and <hi>a falling away</hi> and <hi>Antichrist,</hi> betwixt the former and the later. This last is readily concluded upon, to be the Papacy, and <hi>he that letted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> to mean the Imperiall power: but what was he that letted in the former, that the <hi>Antichrist</hi> among the Jews was not revealed sooner? I should divide this stake betwixt <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour [who by his decree against the Jews in <hi>Rome,</hi> Act. 18.2. give a check by the appearance of his displeasure, to all the Jews elsewhere that they durst not tyrannize against the Gospel whilest he lived as they had done.] And <hi>Paul</hi> himself who by his uncessant travelling in the Gospel, and combatting by the truth every where against the Jews, did keep down very much their delusions and Apostacy whilest he was at liberty and abroad, but when he was once laid up, then all went to ruine, as see <hi>Act.</hi> 20.29. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <hi>Paul</hi> when he departs from <hi>Corinth,</hi> leaves a Church fairly planted there, but how soon and how miserably it grew degenerate, we shall meet vvith cause to observe before it be long.

                  <p>OThers at <hi>Ephesus</hi> there were, that were no further gone in Christianity neither, then the knowledge of the Baptisme of <hi>Iohn: Paul</hi> asks them, <hi>Have ye received the holy Ghost?</hi> they answer, <hi>We have not yet so much as heard whether the holy Ghost be:</hi> In which words they refer to a common and a true tenet of the Nation, which was, that <hi>after the death of</hi> Ezra, Haggai, Zachary <hi>and</hi> Malachy, <hi>the holy Ghost departed from</hi> Israel <hi>and went up: Iuchas. fol.</hi> 15. and they professe they had never yet heard of his restoring. And it is very probable, that they had never heard of <hi>Iesus</hi>; whom when <hi>Paul</hi> had preached to them, they imbrace; and the text saith, <hi>they were then baptized in the Name of the Lord Iesus.</hi> Not that they were rebaptized, but that now coming to the knowledge of the proper end of <hi>Iohns</hi> baptisme, namely to beleeve in <hi>Iesus</hi> as <hi>ver.</hi> 4. they own their baptisme to such an end and construction. For 1. What need had they to be rebaptized, when in that first baptisme they had had taken, they had come in to the profession of the Gospel and of <hi>Christ,</hi> as farre as the doctrine that had brought them in could teach them? It was the change of their profession from <hi>Iudaisme</hi> to <hi>Evangelisme,</hi> that required their being bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and not the degrees of their growth in the knowledge of the Gospel, into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of which they had been baptized already. How many baptismes must the Apostles have undergone, if every signall degree of their coming on to the perfect knowledge of the mystery of <hi>Christ,</hi> might have required, nay might have admitted a new baptizing? 2. If these men were rebaptized, then must the same be concluded of all that had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the baptisme of <hi>Iohn,</hi> when they came to the knowledge of <hi>Iesus:</hi> which as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible, because there is not the least tittle of mention of such a thing, so is it unimagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the case of those of the Apostles that were baptized by <hi>Iohn</hi>; for who should bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them again in the name of <hi>Iesus,</hi> since <hi>Iesus</hi> himself baptized none? <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.3. 3. These men had taken on them <hi>the baptisme of repentance,</hi> and the profession of <hi>Christ,</hi> in the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme of <hi>Iohn,</hi> that they had received: therefore unlesse we will suppose a baptisme of faith, different from the baptisme of repentance, and a baptisme in the name of <hi>Iesus</hi> diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the baptisme in the name of <hi>Christ,</hi> it will be hard to finde a reason, why these men should undergo a new baptizing.</p>
                  <p>And if it should be granted [which is against reason to grant,] that these men were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally rebaptized, yet were not this a warrantable ground for rebaptization now, in regard of these main differences betwixt the case then and now. 1. That great controversie then on foot, about, <hi>Whether Iesus were the true Messias or no,</hi> which caused their rebaptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they were rebaptized. 2. The visible conferring of the holy Ghost upon them, upon their baptisme if they were rebaptized: as being a main induction of such a thing, if such a thing were, that the name of <hi>Iesus</hi> might be so apparently glorified, upon their being baptized in the name of <hi>Iesus:</hi> which indeed was equally glorified, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived those gifts upon their acknowledging of <hi>Iesus,</hi> and owning their baptisme that they had of old been baptized with, as a badge of that acknowledgment, though not baptized again.</p>

THe Apostle hath a long time to stay at <hi>Ephesus:</hi> in which he first begins for the space of a quarter of a year to dispute in the Synagogue: and then when divers were har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened and beleeved not, he separated the Disciples, and disputed daily in the School of <hi>Tyrannus:</hi> Hitherto what converts there were to the Gospel, they resorted still to the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:59067:63"/>
publick service in the Synagogue, where <hi>Paul</hi> reasoned daily for the truth of the Gospel: but finding dangerous opposition, he gets away the Disciples from thence, and in the School of one <hi>Tyrannus</hi> they are a particular Congregation.</p>
                  <p>In these great Towns where there were many Jews, both in <hi>Iudea</hi> and elswhere, they had a Synagogue and a Divinity-School: This Divinity-School they called <hi>Beth Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drash,</hi> and thither they used to go every Sabbath day, after they had been at the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue: whereupon they had this for a common proverb, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>: <hi>From the Synagogue to the Divinity-School.</hi> In the Synagogue they had prayers and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Law, and plain Sermons of Doctrine, exhortation and comfort: In the Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-School were discussed and taught, dogmaticall and controversall points concerning the difficulties of the Law, and other high matters. And hence it be those different titles and administrations of <hi>Pastor</hi> and <hi>Teacher,</hi> Ephes. 4.11. and <hi>He that teacheth, and he that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth,</hi> Rom. 12.7, 8. took their pattern: if <hi>Pastor</hi> mean one of the Ministerial function.</p>
                  <p>In the time of this stay of <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Ephesus, He fought with beasts there after the manner of men,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.32. which seemeth to be understood, of a proper <gap reason="foreign">

Observe in the hubbub of <hi>Demetrius, Pauls</hi> compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are haled presently into the Theater, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. as if there the people had that that would take a course with them. 2. Observe that the <hi>Asiarchae</hi> or <hi>Theater-Officers</hi> are <hi>Pauls</hi> friends, as having knowledge and acquaintance of him and with him before. 3. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius</hi> his uproar which was the greatest danger that <hi>Luke</hi> hath mentioned of him, was not till after he had written his Epistle to <hi>Corinth,</hi> in which, he speaks of fighting with beasts, and therefore that could not be meant. 4. The phrase <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

The trouble that befell him in <hi>Asia,</hi> by which he was pressed above measure, and even despaired of life, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.8, 9. cannot be understood so well of the tumult of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> for we read not of any hand laid upon <hi>Paul</hi> in it, as of some other danger neerer dearth.</p>
                  <p>In the latter year of these two above written, which was part of <hi>Pauls</hi> last year at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> on the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>October</hi> of that year, <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour dieth, and <hi>Nero</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth him: a wretch whose memory is not worth looking after, unlesse it be for dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation: yet must we in our further progresse of viewing the actions of <hi>Paul,</hi> and rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Epistles, be beholden to the Chronicall observation of his years.</p>

Some Postscripts have named <hi>Timothy</hi> for the bearer, antedating his journey to <hi>Corinth,</hi> which was not in his going to <hi>Mecedon,</hi> but in his return back, and when this Epistle had already given them notice of his coming that way, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Apollos</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Epistle was with him at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and was desired by <hi>Paul</hi> to have gone along with the brethren to <hi>Corinth,</hi> but he would not, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.11. it may be because he would not countenance a faction there by his presence, which was begun under his name. The Church was exceedingly broken into divisions, which produced very dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full effects among them. These severall enormities raged in that Church, though so late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and so nobly planted, and all originally derived from this first mischief of faction and schisme.</p>
               <p n="1">1. A member of the Church had married his fathers wife, yea as it seemeth 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.12. his father yet living: which crime by their own Law and Canons deserved death: <hi>For he that went in to his fathers wife was doubly liable to be stoned, both because she was his fathers wife, and because she was another mans wife, whether he lay with her in his fathers life time, or after his death,</hi> Talm. in Sanhed. per. 7. &amp; Maym, in Issure biah. per 1. &amp; 2. And yet they in the height of the contestings they had among themselves, did not only, not take away such a wreth from among them, nor mourn for the miscarriage, but he had got a party that bolstered him up and abetted him: and so while they should have mourned they were puffed up. His own party in triumph that they could bear him out against the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, and the other in rejoycing that in the contrary faction there was befallen such a scandall. Or both as taking this Libertinism as a new liberty of the Gospel. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle adviseth his giving up to Satan, by a power of miracles which was then in being. So likewise did he give up <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.20. The derivation of this power we conceived at <hi>Act</hi> 5. [in the case of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi>] to be from that passage of Christ to the Disciples, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 20.22. <hi>He breathed on them and said, whose sinnes ye retain they are retained,</hi> &amp;c. and so were the Apostles indued with a miraculous power
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:59067:64"/>
of a contrary effect or operation. They could heal diseases and bestow the holy Ghost, and they could inflict death or diseases, and give up to Satan. Now though it may be questioned, whether any in the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> had this power, yet when <hi>Pauls spirit with the power of the Lord Iesus Christ</hi> went along in the action, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.4. there can be no doubt of the effect.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Their animosities were so great, that they not only instigated them to common suits at Law, but to suits before the tribunals of the Heathen, which as it was contrary to the peace and honour of the doctrine of the Gospel, so was it even contrary to their Judaick traditions: which required their subjection and appeals, only to men of their own blood, or of their own Religion. The Apostle to rectifie this misdemeanour, first cals them to remember, that <hi>the Saints should judge the world,</hi> and this he mentioneth as a thing known to them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.2. and it was known to them from <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.18, 27. <hi>And the Kingdom and Dominion, and the greatnesse of the Kingdom shall be given to the people of the Saints of the most high.</hi> How miserably this is misconstrued by too many of a fifth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, when Saints shall only Rule, is to be read in too many miseries that have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that opinion. The Apostles meaning is no more but this, <hi>Do you not know that there shall be a Christian Magistracy?</hi> or that Christians shall be Rulers and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> matters? Observe in what sense he had taken the word <hi>Saints</hi> in the former verse, name<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly for <hi>Christians</hi> in the largest sense, as set in opposition to the Heathen. And he speaks in the tenour of <hi>Daniel</hi> from whence his words are taken, that though the world and Church had been ruled and judged and domineered over, by the four Monarchies which were Heathen, yet under the Kingdom of Christ under the Gospel, they should be ruled and judged by Christian Kings, Magistrates and Rulers. Secondly, he minds them, <hi>Know ye not that we shall judge Angels?</hi> ver. 3. Observe that he saies not as before, Know ye not that <hi>the Saints</hi> shall judge Angels? but <hi>we.</hi> By Angels it is uncontrovertedly granted that he meaneth evil Angels the Devils: Now <hi>the Saints,</hi> that is all Christians that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed the Gospel were not to judge Devils, but <hi>we,</hi> saith he, that is the Apostles and Preachers of the Gospel; who by the power of their Ministry ruined his Oracles, Idols, delusions and worship, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore he argueth, since there is to be a Gospel Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracy to rule and judge the world, and a Gospel Ministry that should judge and destroy the Devils, they should not account themselves so utterly uncapable of judging in things of their civil converse, as upon every controversie to go to the Bench of the Heathens to the great dishonour of the Gospel. And withall adviseth them, <hi>to set them to judge who were lesse esteemed in the Church,</hi> ver. 4. Not that he denieth subjection to the Heathen Magistrate which now was over them, or incourageth them to the usurpation of his power: but that he asserteth the profession of the Gospel, capable of judging in such things, and by improving of that capacity, as farre as fell within their line, he would have them provide for their own peace, and the Gospels credit. We observed before, that though the Jews were under the Roman power, yet they permitted them to live in their own Religion, and by their own Laws to maintain their Religion: and it may not be impertinent to take up and inlarge that matter a little here. As the Jews under the <hi>Roman</hi> subjection had their great <hi>Sanhedrin,</hi> and their lesse of three and twenty Judges, as appears both in Scripture, and in their Records, so were not these bare names, or civil bodies without a foul, but they were inlivened by their juridicall, executive power, in which they were instated of old: So that though they were at the disposall of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Power, and Religion, and Laws, and all went to wrack when the Emperour was offended at them, as it was in the time of <hi>Caligula,</hi> yet for the most part, from the time of the <hi>Romans</hi> power first coming over them, to the time of their own last Rebellion, which was their ruine, the authority of their <hi>Sanhedrins</hi> and Judicatories was preserved in a good measure intire, and they had administration of justice of their own Magistracy, as they injoyed their own Religion. And this both within the Land and without, yea even after <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was destroyed, as we shall shew in its due place. And as it was thus in the free actings of their <hi>Sanhedrins,</hi> so also was it in the actings of their Synagogues, both in matters of Religion and of civil interest: For in every Synagogue as there were Rulers of the Synagogue in reference to matters of Religion and Divine worship, so were there Rulers or Magistrates in reference to Civil affairs, which judged in such matters. Every Synagogue had <hi>Beth din shel sheleshah,</hi> a Consistory or Judicatory, or what you will call it, of three Rulers or Magistrates, to whom belonged to judge between party
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:59067:64"/>
and party in matters of money, stealth, damage, restitution, penalties, and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things which are mentioned and handled in both <hi>Talmuds</hi> in the Treatise <hi>Sanhedrin per.</hi> 1. Who had not power indeed of capitall punishments, but they had of corporall, namely of scourging to fourty stripes save one. Hence it is that Christ foretels his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>In the Synagogues you shall be beaten,</hi> Mark 13.9. and hence had <hi>Paul</hi> his five scourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.24. So that in every Synagogue there were <hi>Elders that ruled</hi> in Civil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and <hi>Elders that laboured in the Word and Doctrine.</hi> And all things well considered, it may not be so monstrous, as it seems to some, to say it might very well be so in those times in Christian Congregations. For since, as it might be shewed, that Christ and his Apostles in platforming of the modell of Christian Churches in those times, did keep very close to the platform of the Synagogues: and since the <hi>Romans</hi> in those times made no difference betwixt Jews in Judaism, and Jews that were turned Christians, nor betwixt those Religions: for as yet there was no persecution raised against Christianity, why might not Christian Congregations have and exercise that double Function of Ministry and Magistracy in them as well as the Jewish Synagogues? And if that much controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted place, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. should be interpreted according to such a sense, it were neither irrationall, nor improbable. Nor to interpret <hi>Paul</hi> speaking to such a tenour here. Only his appointing of <gap reason="foreign">

It was the old Jewish garb, when they went to pray, to hide head and face, with a vail, to betoken their ashamednesse and confusion of face wherewithall they appeared before God: And hence is the conjunction of these two words so common in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>Now in this Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the men retained the Jewish custom that they prayed vailed, or with their head and face covered, but the women transgressed their Jewish Law, for they went unvailed and bare faced into the publick Congregation, and their reason was, as it seemeth by the Apostles discourse, because they, in regard of their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and comely feature, needed lesse to be ashamed before God in his worship then the men. The Apostle reproves both, and argues that if the man pray vailed, who is the Image and glory of God, then much more should the woman, who is but the glory of the man. But he cries down the mans praying vailed, as dishonouring his head; and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts that <hi>the woman have power on her head, because of the Angels,</hi> cap. 11.10. The word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> which we observed instantly before, out of <hi>Maymony</hi> signified a <hi>womans vail,</hi> doth also signifie <hi>power</hi> or <hi>dominion:</hi> and accordingly the Apostle speaketh, Let the woman have <hi>power</hi> on her head: But what means he by, <hi>Because of the Angels?</hi> I should answer, <hi>Because of the devils:</hi> for these he had called <hi>Angels</hi> also, a few Chapters before, <hi>viz. Chap.</hi> 6.3. And his words may be construed to this sense, that women should not expose their faces openly in the Congregation, lest the devil make a bait of their beauty, and thereby intangle the eyes and hearts of the men, who should be then better imployed, then gazing and longing after beauty. There are, that by <hi>Angels</hi> understand the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and interpret it, that women should be vailed lest the Ministers eyes should be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled by their faces: which exposition if it be admitted, it may speak for the admission of that also which we give, which provides for the eyes of the whole Congregation as well as of the Ministers.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the same eleventh Chapter he also blameth their disorder in receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Lords Supper in the height of their heats and contestations. Wherein they
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:59067:65"/>
did not only not discern the Lords Body, a Symbole and tie of communion, but they even transgressed that rule now Christians, which those of them that were Jews would not have done in their Judaism. It was then a Canon current, and binding amongst them, <hi>that none should eat and drink in their Synagogues, and none should sleep,</hi> Jerus. in Megilla fol. 74. col. 1. <hi>Maym.</hi> in Tephillah per. 11. and Gloss. in <hi>Maym.</hi> in Shabb. 30. But now as they ate and drank the Bread and the Cup in the Sacrament, in their Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and that warrantably, so did they also presume unwarrantably to eat their own common suppers there, and that only in defiance one of another, the rich to outface the poor, and one party another with their good commons; some banketing and feasting to the full, whilest others sat hungry by and looked on. [See how <gap reason="foreign">

Much like surfeting <hi>Nabals</hi> case and end.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And as the people were thus irregular in this part of worship in their publick assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, so were their Ministers faulty in others, namely about the managing of spirituall gifts there. The pretence to the spirit [where indeed it was not] hath alwaies been the great usherer in of all errour and delusion: And to this the very unbeleeving Jews pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and often backed their pretences with magicall impostures: and of this the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle speaks, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.3. <hi>No man speaking by the Spirit of God,</hi> as these men took on them to do, <hi>can call Iesus accursed,</hi> as they called him. And on the other hand, some that had spirituall gifts indeed, failed in the using of them to the edification of the Church, but put them forth sometime for their own vainglory: and such was their miscarriage which he taxeth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. They that from that Chapter would ground a preaching by the Spirit now, sure do little observe what they do to build upon an example which the Apostle reproveth: and they inferre from a place much mistaken.</p>
               <p>There were indeed the extraordinary gifts of tongues and prophecying in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> but who had them, and what had they in having them, and how used they them? 1. It was not every or indeed any <hi>private</hi> member of the Congregation that had them, but the Ministers only, and by these very gifts and imposition of the Apostles hands by which these gifts were conferred, they were inducted into the Ministry and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to it. The learned Reader will observe the difference that in <hi>ver.</hi> 16. is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him that spake with the tongues, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>A private man,</hi> that sat by. 2. It was not to gabble with any tongue that is called <hi>speaking with a tongue</hi> [for to what edification possible could it be for any Minister in <hi>Corinth</hi> to speak Persick, Coptick, Gallick or any other strange language in that Congregation where all of them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood one and the same language?] but it was to understand and speak the Originals of Scriptures, as was touched before, and to be able to unfold them, and so to prophesie or preach to the people. Observe these passages in the Chapter: <hi>He that speaketh with a strange tongue edifieth himself,</hi> ver. 4. And, <hi>I would you all spake with tongues:</hi> Now how could a man edifie himself by speaking in some strange remote language, when he might speak or understand the very same thing in his own mother tongue? And what were they better, if they all so spake, unlesse it were, that thereby they were the fitter to look into all humane learning? But he or all of them that were able to understand and speak the originall language of Scripture, might thereby edifie themselves, and therein speak and understand what they could not in their mother tongue. 3. It appears by the Apostles discourse that these men used these gifts irregularly, confusedly and for their own vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, which he rebukes and rectifies.</p>
               <p n="6">6. There were also in or crept into this Church, those that were either down right Sadduces in denying the resurrection, or that though with the Pharisees they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged it, yet denied it of those that had forsaken their Judaisme, and so would exclude all Christians from it: Upon this the fifteenth Chapter discourseth so fully and divinely that nothing can be more.</p>
               <p>Those that this Church sent to visit <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> brought with them a Letter from the Church, in the which they desired to be resolved about some doubts: as</p>

reckon the first command of the 613. <hi>Vid. marg. ad tripl. Targ. ad Gen.</hi> 1. And this their Canons did so strictly binde on as a duty, that they say that <hi>he that lives to such an age and marries not transgresseth, a preceptive Law.</hi> Maym. in <gap reason="foreign">

In this case the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle saith, <hi>Praeceptum non habeo</hi>; that he accounted it no such command, but every one was left to his liberty: according as he could contain, or not contain. And in his stating this case, how he speaks the language of his Nation, and how far he comes towards their opinions, or goes from them, the learned may observe, by comparing the beginning of this Chapter, with <hi>Maymony</hi> in his Treatise <gap reason="foreign">

He speaketh of all <hi>Israels</hi> being baptized unto <hi>Moses</hi> in the cloud and sea, and so separate from all <hi>Egyptian</hi> and other Idolatry and prophannesse; and our baptism speaks the like separation. The Jews say <hi>Moses was sanctified by the cloud,</hi> Jerus. in Joma fol. 38. col. 2. and <hi>Paul</hi> speaks here the same of all <hi>Israel,</hi> Chap. 10.2.</p>

               </p>
               <p>He concludes the Epistle with a sad execration upon <hi>Whosoever loveth not the Lord Iesus Christ, let such a one be Anathema Maran Atha,</hi> Chap. 16.22. that is, <hi>let him be accursed</hi> or destroyed: <hi>Our Lord cometh.</hi> In which that he in the first aim and intention meaneth the unbelieving Jews, may be observed upon these four considerations. 1. Because the Jews of all men under heaven were and are the greatest haters of <hi>Christ. Pagans</hi> indeed do not love the Lord <hi>Iesus,</hi> because they know him not, but again because they know him not they hate him not. The <hi>Turks</hi> love not <hi>Christ</hi> as Christians love him, but again they hate not <hi>Christ</hi> as the Jews hate him. The word <hi>Iesus</hi> here carries the <hi>Emphasis</hi> to levell this execration at them: they pretended to love <hi>Messias</hi> or a <hi>Christ,</hi> but openly professe hatred of <hi>Iesus.</hi> 2. Because the Apostle here useth such Dialect, as that he speaketh in the very Jews language in the words <hi>Maran atha.</hi> He had spoken in Greek all along the Epistle, and Greek all along his Epistles, and that here alone he should use a Syriack phrase and not translate it, it doth evidently shew, that his speech referreth more especially to the Jewish Nation. So <hi>Ieremy</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>v.</hi> 11. threatning and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Idolatry, doth it in the <hi>Chaldean</hi> language; one clause of which he useth not throughout his Prophesie beside. 3. The Jews of all men did chiefly or only call Jesus <hi>Anathema,</hi> as <hi>Chap.</hi> 12<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>3. and as they are not ashamed openly to confesse in their <hi>Talmud</hi>; therefore against them of all men first and chiefly is this <hi>Anathema</hi> aimed. 4. This is agreeable to what the Scripture speaks copiously in other places: as <hi>Isa.</hi> 65.15. <hi>You shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Malac.</hi> 4.6. <hi>Lest I come and smite the Land with a curse,</hi> &amp;c. The most pious and charitable Apostle could wish himself to be <hi>Anathema</hi> for that Nation, on condition that they might beleeve and be saved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3. but since they will not beleeve, and do refuse salvation, and hate the Saviour, he forgets consanguinity for the love of <hi>Christ,</hi> and dooming and devoting all whomsoever, that loved not the Lord <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> to destruction, he intends them in the first place who were his chief haters.</p>
               <p>The words <hi>Maran-atha</hi> are held by some to be of the form of the highest excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication; <hi>Sic signatur,</hi> say they, <hi>species extremi Anathematis, ac si diceretur, Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictus esto ad adventum &amp; in adventu Domini:</hi> And withall that <hi>Maran atha</hi> is the same in sense with <hi>Shammatha:</hi> but this utterly without the warrant of any Jewish antiquity [whose language it is] at all. I beleeve it is impossible to shew <hi>Maran atha</hi> for a form of Excommunication or execration in any of their Writings, nay very hard if not next
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:59067:66"/>
impossible to shew the words <hi>Maran atha</hi> in their Writings at all in any sense.</p>
               <p>The phrase in the Apostle refers first to <hi>Christs</hi> coming in vengeance against <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and the Jewish Nation, as the execration is first to be pitched upon them: <hi>Maran atha, Our Lord cometh.</hi> Many and dreadfull things are spoken of this his coming in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, of which we have spoken in severall places as we have come along. So that in this sentence he doth both justly doom this unbelieving and wretched Nation to their deserved curse, and doth withall in this phrase intimate that the doomed curse was near approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the Lords coming in vengeance against them. Now though we construe the words in such an application to the Jews, it is not exclusively, but that their sense reacheth also to every one that loveth not the Lord <hi>Iesus</hi> of what Nation soever, and the Lord will come in time to make him an <hi>Anathema.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is some obscurity in a passage in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.9. both of sense and history: <hi>I wrote unto you in an Epistle not to company with fornicators:</hi> 10. <hi>Yet not altogether with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicators of this world,</hi> &amp;c. Where first we have to inquire what it is that the Apostle doth here forbid them, and then, when it was that he wrote this Epistle that he speaketh of. There are two things that are here prohibited; one, when he wrote that which he speaketh of, namely, that they should <hi>not company with fornicators</hi>; and the other now when he writes this Epistle, <hi>viz.</hi> that they should <hi>not eat with such:</hi> the later he had permitted till now, though he prohibited the former, which let them well observe that understand by <hi>eating</hi> the receiving of the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>Besides what communion was among the Jews <hi>in sacris,</hi> there was a twofold compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying or communicating among them in civil things; the one more common, the other more neer and peculiar: Their more common was, eating together at the same common table: For even such eating they accounted of, as of a communion, under a rule: and hence no eating with Gentiles for any Jew, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.3. nor with Publicans and sinners for any that were of the stricter sort of Religions: therefore <hi>Christ</hi> is cavilled at for it so oft in the Gospel. The other was that communion or associating, which they called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> the former of which comprehended their near joyning in partnership, deputations and the like, of the which the triple Talmudick, Tract <hi>Bava,</hi> and <hi>Maymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> of <hi>Shittuphin</hi> and <hi>Shilluchin,</hi> do treat at large. The later comprehended their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bining in joynt interest and association, in the use of any common Court or Cloister where many dwelt together: of which the Treatise <hi>Erubhin</hi> is a large discourse and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure enough. Now the Apostle in the former prohibition <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, seems to forbid this nearer communion: that if any that is called <hi>a brother</hi> or a Christian, be a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicator, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they should not associate with him in any such conjunction as partnership, deputation, imployment, cohabitation or common interest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But upon the hearing of this horrid fact and example of the incestuous person, he heightens his prohibition, and now forbids, that they should not use so much as that common society with them, as to eat with them at common tables: which was to set them at the utmost distance, even at the same that the Jews did the very Heathens, for with them they might not eat.</p>
               <p>Now how to understand <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, is of some difficulty. Some conceive it means an Epistle, which was sent before this, and which was lost. Which is an expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition somewhat hard to digest. Certainly it is gentler and more warrantable, yea even by the rules of grammar to render <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> to such a sense as this, I wrote, or had written, or was writing in this Epistle that you should not company with fornicators, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but now hearing and weighing this high offence of the incestuous person, and the danger of such an example, I sharpen my style, and now forbid not only your near associating with such, but even the common fellowship of eating together at common tables, which was as much as that which is spoken, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17. <hi>Let him be to thee as an heathen man.</hi>

                  <p>The great Temple was reputed one of the seven wonderous fabricks of the world: It was hundreds of years in building at the charge of all <hi>Asia,</hi> before it came to its last ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency and perfection.

And as from hence it may be gathered how great a work it was to plant the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in this center of Idolatry, so doth <hi>Demetrius</hi> readily observe, how great a detriment is like to accrew to him and his fellows by the Gospels destroying that Idolatry, as daily it did. Hereupon they raise a tumult against <hi>Paul,</hi> which is not only promoted by the Idolatrous Heathen, but by the Jews also, though upon another score. In the hubbub there is mention of <hi>Alexander, whom they drew out of the multitude the Iews putting him forward. And he beckened with the hand and would have made his defence unto the people, but when they knew he was a Iew, they would not hear him,</hi> ver. 33, 34. And <hi>Paul</hi> in his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> who was at <hi>Ephesus</hi> when he wrote to him, saith, <hi>Alexander the Coppersmith did me much evil,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.14.

pledges of their tendernesse and love towards himself, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.15, 16. that he is not only resolved to venture himself again amongst them, but he holds himself ingaged to revisit them, and to bestow his pains again among them for their further proficiency in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. At his departure from <hi>Ephesus</hi> he leaveth <hi>Timothy</hi> there behinde him, though in a dangerous place and time, yet necessity by reason of false teachers that were ready to break out, so requiring it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3, 4.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the way as he goes he makes some stay at <hi>Troas:</hi> where though he had fair suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in his Ministry, yet not finding <hi>Titus</hi> whom he expected to have met withall from <hi>Corinth,</hi> he makes not long stay there, but sets away again speedily for <hi>Macedonia,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.12, 13.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It was in his thoughts whilest he was at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> to have touched at <hi>Corinth</hi> in this his journey, and to have made some stay there, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.15, 16. but thus missing of <hi>Titus</hi> at <hi>Troas,</hi> and neither from him, nor yet from any other receiving intelligence how his Epistle that he had written thither took with them, he thought it best to go by, and not to call there at this time, because he doubted he should have a heavy and comfortlesse meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.1, 2.</p>
                  <p n="4">4.

               <p n="6">as may be concluded upon these observations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is apparent from 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.3. &amp; 3.15. that that Epistle was written after <hi>Pauls</hi> setting out from <hi>Ephesus</hi> for <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and yet when he was in some thoughts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning shortly for <hi>Ephesus</hi> again.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Now it cannot be conceived to have been written when he was going towards <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia,</hi> for then was he but newly parted from <hi>Timothy,</hi> and it is not likely he would so write to him when he was but newly come from him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Nor can it be conceived to be written when he was coming back again from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia</hi> into <hi>Greece,</hi> for then he was going to <hi>Ephesus</hi> in his own determination, and might have been his own messenger, and had needed no Epistle sending at all. And besides he intimates in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.16. that it might be, he might stay a little long before he came to him: Therefore it cannot but be concluded that this Epistle was written whilest he was in <hi>Macedonia</hi> or the parts thereabouts, at this time that we are upon.</p>
               <p>It is something strange that there should be so various and roving conjectures about the time and place of the writing of this Epistle where there is so plain a demonstration thereof in the Epistle it self, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Arabick</hi> dateth it from <hi>Athens:</hi> supposing it, belike, at the time of his perambulation of <hi>Greece,</hi> of which there is mention in <hi>ver.</hi> 3. of this Chapter: the Syriack <hi>from Laodicea:</hi> some Greek copies adde from <hi>Laodicea Paca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiana:</hi> which mistake belike grew, because there is mention of an Epistle from <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea,</hi> Coloss. 4.16. of which we shall speak and shew the mistake when we come to the time of that Epistle. The <hi>Rhemists</hi> suppose this Epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> was written at <hi>Pauls</hi> first imprisonment in <hi>Rome,</hi> when he was dismissed and set at liberty, but how erroniously, will appear when we come to observe the time of the second Epistle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> had bestowed much pains and a long time with the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi> being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with it: and he takes much care of it now he is gone thence: partly because of the eminency of the place, and partly because of the ficklenesse of some, who were ready to warp from the sound truth and doctrine received, to heresie and foolish opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. For the keeping down of these therefore that they should not overgrow the

               <p>He had two works to do in that City: first to prevent rising Error<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and Heterodoxies, and secondly to direct and order the Orthodox aright in Worship and Discipline: not as any Diocesan Bishop [for he staid but a while there, and what he did, he did but by the Apostles direction,] but as one that <hi>Paul</hi> had found sound, bold, blamelesse, painfull and faithfull.</p>
               <p>Among the Jewish Churches that received the Gospel, there grew in time a very epidemicall and dangerous Apostacy, either totally from the Doctrine of the Gospel, or partially from the purity of it, as we have frequent occasion to observe upon seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall passages that we meet withall as we go along: And this backsliding from the Doctrine and Profession of Christ once received, was the topping up of the iniquity of that Nation, and was a forerunner and a hastener of their destruction and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting off.</p>
               <p>The first principles whereby their false teachers did poison them toward this recidiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were, puzzling them with idle fables, intricate genealogies, and especially nice curiosities, and needlesse obligations of the Law: Their fables that were likeliest to serve their turn for this purpose [as near as one may guesse upon view of the whole heap in their Talmudick records] may be supposed to have been those strange legends that they related of the wondrous sanctity, devotion and facts of some of their Pharisai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and legall righteous ones, and the wondrous gallantry and golden daies that they conceited in a carnall construction of the times of <hi>Messias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their endlesse genealogies which the Apostle speaketh of <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.9. and mentioneth together with these fables, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.4. were not any of the genealogies of Scripture, holy and divine, but their long and intricate pedigrees that they stood upon, to prove themselves Jews, Levites, Priests and the like, thereby to interest themselves in chain to all those brave things that they perswaded themselves belonged to a Jew as a Jew, upon that very account: And to these we may adde the long genealogy and pedigree of their traditions which they derived by a long line of succession through the hands of I know not how many Doctors: of which the Talmudick Treatise <hi>Avoth,</hi> is as a Herald. And if we will construe the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </p>
               <p>And as for their making their baits of the Law for the catching and withdrawing of simple souls either totally from the acknowledging, or at least from the simplicity of the Gospel, it is very obvious in the Epistles of <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Epistles how they wrought, and how they prevailed: the witchery of old customs and long use, and the gawdinesse of a Ceremonious Religion, helping them to speed in their designes, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding their deceivings.</p>
               <p>Such canker began to break out in the Church of <hi>Ephesus:</hi> whose creeping and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting, it is the first and great work of <hi>Timothy</hi> to prevent, and to fill the ears of his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with sound doctrine and admonitions, which might keep such deceit and infection out. And answerably it must be his care to settle the Church in such a salubrious consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Worship, Ministry and Government, as that it should not be ready to sway and incline to such dangerous seductions. Hereupon doth the Apostle lay a divine Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectory before him, concerning their manner of praying, choosing and ordaining Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, approving Deacons, admitting widows, and regulating the people, that nothing could be wanting to the healthfull temper of that Church if they receive and imbrace these applications: In the most of which prescriptions he useth exceeding much of their Synagogue language, that he may be the better understood, and reflecteth upon divers of their own Laws and customs, that what he prescribeth may imprint upon them with the more conviction. He calleth the Minister <hi>Episcopus,</hi> from the common and known title <hi>The Chazan</hi> or <hi>Overseer</hi> in the Synagogue: Aruch in <gap reason="foreign">

he had spoken of in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi> Both these in the common language then best known, were called <hi>Elders,</hi> and both owned as <hi>Rulers.</hi> Yea the very title that they usually tearmed <hi>Deacons</hi> by [<hi>Parnasin</hi>] was the common word that was used to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie <hi>a Ruler.</hi> The <hi>Ierusalem</hi> Talmud in Peah. <hi>fol.</hi> 21.1. speaking of the three <hi>Parnasin</hi> or Deacons that were in every Synagogue, hath these two passages, which may be some illustration to two passages in this Epistle. <hi>They appoint not lesse then three Parnasin in the Congregation: for if matters of money were judged by three, matters of life much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire three to manage them.</hi> Observe that the Deacons Office was accounted as an Office that concerned this life, namely in taking care for the subsistence of the poor. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this may that in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.12. be understood. <hi>For they that have used the Office of a Deacon well, purchase to themselves a good degree.</hi> A good degree towards being intrusted with souls, when they have been faithfull in discharge of their trust concerning the life of the body. The other passage is this, <hi>R. Haggai whensoever he appointed Parnasin</hi> [Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons] <hi>he urged the Law upon the people, saying, All rule that is given, is given from the Law, &amp;c.</hi> And here you may likewise observe, that Deaconship is called Rule.</p>
               <p>We observed before, that it were not so monstrous as it might seem, if by <hi>Elders that ruled only</hi> we should understand a Civil Magistracy or Bench in every Congregation, as there was in every Synagogue; but since the Apostle nameth only <hi>Bishops and D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>It is not much materiall to controvert whether he sent this Epistle in the way as he went towards <hi>Macedonia,</hi> or when he was come up into <hi>Macedonia</hi>; it is enough to know, that it was in this scantling of time, either in his journey thither, or instantly upon his coming there.

                  <hi>There</hi> I have determined to winter: as if he were not yet come thither.</p>
               <p>Who first planted the Gospel in <hi>Creete</hi> may he an endlesse inquiry: certain it is that some <hi>Cretans</hi> were present at the first powring out of the holy Ghost in the gift of tongues, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.8. but whether they embraced the Gospel and returned with it into their own Country, is an inquiry as endlesse: Whether <hi>Barnabas</hi> ever preached there we may question also, but when we have done all we can never resolve. It is more then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that <hi>Paul</hi> was there himself, from that expression <hi>I left thee in Creete,</hi> but his stay there when he left <hi>Titus</hi> could not be long, as is easily cleared from the time of his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys lately mentioned.</p>
               <p>Whether he had been there some time before, or whether he had sent the Gospel thither by some of his Ministers, or however it came there, there wanted something to the constituting of the Church, which he leaveth <hi>Titus</hi> to accomplish: And his work is just the same that he left <hi>Timothy</hi> at <hi>Ephesus</hi> for, as is easily seen by laying together the two Epistles, <hi>viz.</hi> to stop the mouth of the Heterodox, and to direct and advise the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox in Doctrine and Discipline, and to ordain Elders or Ministers in the Churches.</p>
               <p>This matter of ordaining Elders hath made the <hi>postscripts</hi> of the Epistles to these two men to intitle them Bishops, the one of <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and the other of <hi>Creete,</hi> who how little they stayed or setled in either of these places, he readeth but dimly that seeth not.</p>
               <p>The Apostle in this Epistle urgeth him to dispatch the businesse that lay before him, that upon notice from him, he might be ready to come up to him to <hi>Nicopolis:</hi> a City that bare the name and badge of the victory that <hi>Augustus</hi> obtained against <hi>Antony.</hi> Dion.

               <head>THE SECOND EPISTLE TO THE <hi>CORINTHIANS.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>The proof that it was written and sent at this time and in this manner, is plain by these places and passages in it: <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.2, 3, 4. <hi>I know the forwardnesse of your minde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia: Yet have I sent the brethren, lest our boasting of you should be in vain; left haply they of Macedonia come with me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Behold the third time I am coming to you.</hi> Chap. 13.1. <hi>This is the third time I am coming to you.</hi> And <hi>Chap.</hi> 8.16. <hi>But thanks be unto God who put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you.</hi> 17. <hi>Being more forward of his own accord he went unto you.</hi> 18. <hi>And with him we have sent the brother whose praise is in the Gospel.</hi> 22. <hi>And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Who these two namelesse persons should be, will require some inquiry. The later I suppose was <hi>Erastus,</hi> both because his diligence had been approved before, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.22, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and also because it is said <hi>Erastus abode at Corinth,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. yet he not named among <hi>Pauls</hi> retinue when he set out for <hi>Asia,</hi> Act. 20.4. because he was gone to <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> before.</p>
               <p>As for the other brother <hi>whose praise</hi> is said to be <hi>in the Gospel,</hi> that very phrase and expression hath caused many to conceive, that it was <hi>Luke,</hi> and that the words mean, <hi>Who is famous in all the Churches for the Gospel he hath written:</hi> whereas [besides that groundlesse strictnesse that is put upon the words, limiting them to the writing of a Gospel, which according to that most usuall manner of speech, are rather to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of his renown <hi>in preaching the Gospel</hi>] it is apparent by the words of <hi>Luke</hi> himself, that he went not either before <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Corinth,</hi> as this brother spoken of did, nor did he go before <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Troas</hi> as the rest that are named by him did, but he went in <hi>Pauls</hi> company: for observe his speech, <hi>These tarried for us at Troas: And we sailed away from Philippi,</hi> &amp;c. The words <hi>Vs</hi> and <hi>We</hi> do plainly associate the penman himself with <hi>Paul</hi> at his setting out, and shew that he was none of those that were sent before.</p>
               <p>Others therefore do guesse that this brother that went along with <hi>Titus,</hi> was <hi>Silas,</hi> because it is said, <hi>Who also was chosen by the Churches to travell with us,</hi> &amp;c. Which very thing which they use for an argument to prove it <hi>Silas,</hi> proves against it, for <hi>Silas</hi> was not chosen <hi>by the Churches</hi> to go with <hi>Paul,</hi> any more then <hi>Timothy</hi> or <hi>Titus</hi> were; but he was chosen by <hi>Paul</hi> alone, as they also were. <hi>See</hi> Act. 15.40.</p>
               <p>That clause then, <hi>Who was also chosen of the Churches to travell with us,</hi> doth deal the matter betwixt <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> for none other can be named, to whom the words can be so properly applied as to one of them: and of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>wo, most properly to <hi>Mark</hi>; and he I doubt not, is the man that is here intended: For 1. the words <hi>with us,</hi> joyn <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> together in their travell, and the third man who was chosen to travell with them was none but <hi>Mark.</hi> For 2. he was chosen by the Church at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for that purpose, <hi>Act.</hi> 12.25. and by the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> Act. 13 5. as these words <hi>he was chosen by the Churches</hi> do well explain those verses. 3. It is true indeed that <hi>Paul</hi> had taken distast at <hi>Mark,</hi> and so bitter, that <hi>Barnabas</hi> and he had parted upon it, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.39. yet in his second Epistle to <hi>Timothy</hi> he desires <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>bring Mark to him, for that he is profitable to him for the Ministry,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. by which it appears that he was not only reconciled to him, but also that he had made use of him and found him usefull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When it was that they knit into amity and imployment again, is not discoverable, but that they had done so, the passage newly alledged, doth make past deniall; and if his imployment of <hi>Mark</hi> were not now, or before, he can no more imploy him, before he himself become a prisoner. When we come to the time and order of the second Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> we shall have occasion to speak to this matter again, and shall finde something
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:59067:69"/>
there to help the confirmation of this assertion, nay to raise it higher then yet it hath spoken, namely, that <hi>Mark</hi> was not only sent by <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Corinth</hi> at this time, but also that he was at <hi>Corinth</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> sent for him to come to him to <hi>Rome.</hi> And thus if these words, <hi>Whose praise is in the Gospel,</hi> were to be understood of one that had written a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, here is a subject to apply them to in that sense, for this <hi>Mark</hi> wrote a Gospel as well as <hi>Luke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Apostle in this second Epistle to <hi>Corinth,</hi> doth first excuse his not coming to them according as he had promised in his first Epistle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.5. clearing himself from all lightnesse in making, and from all unfaithfulnesse in breaking that promise, and pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the main reason upon themselves and their present condition: because he had not yet intelligence when he went first into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> of any reformation among them of those enormities that he had reproved in his first Epistle, therefore he was unwilling to come to them in heavinesse, and with a scourge. This his failing to come according to his promise, had opened the mouths of divers in his disgrace, and false teachers took any other occasion to vilifie him, which he copiously satisfies and vindicates himself all along the Epistle.</p>
               <p>His exceeding zealous plainnesse with them, and dealing so home and throughly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their misdemeanours as he did, was one advantage that false teachers and his ill-willers took to open their mouth against him, and to withdraw hearts from him: and withall and mainly, because he was so urgent against the works of the Law as to Justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and those rites which the Jews, even the most that were converted to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, too much doted on. About the former, their taunt and scorn against him was, <hi>His Letters are weighty and powerfull, but his bodily presence is weak and speech contemptible, Chap.</hi> 10.10. A poor contemptible fellow [say they] to be so sharp and supercilious in his Letters, this is more then he durst speak if he were here! <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But let such know, saies he, that what I am by Letters in absence, I will be by words and in deed in presence. Concerning both this and the latter named, they passed <hi>Festus</hi> his censure upon him, as <hi>Act.</hi> 26.24. <hi>that he was besides himself.</hi> This he mentions and answers, <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.13. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are besides our selves it is for God, or whether we be sober it is for your cause. For the love of Christ constraineth us, because we thus judge: that if one died for all, then were all dead,</hi> &amp;c. Since <hi>Christ</hi> died for all, that is, for Jews and Gentiles both, he could not but conclude that all were dead, the Jew as well as the Gentile; therefore he could not but so urgently call upon the Jew to look off his own righteousnesse, and the works of the Law, and to look for Justification by faith in <hi>Christ.</hi> Another scandalous opinion and reproach they also took up of him, <hi>That he walked after the flesh</hi> [a strange slander of <hi>Paul] Chap.</hi> 10.2. but this was but an appendix to that before: because he was not Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risaically precise about their triviall rites of the Law [which too many of them mixed with the Gospel,] but cried them down, therefore they cried him up for carnall. His answer to this is, that his Ministry may witnesse the contrary for him, <hi>ver.</hi> 3.4, 5. the end of which and the abundant effect of which was to beat down such carnall affections and actions as were such indeed: His expression of the weapons of his warfare being strong to pull down strong holds, expounds that <hi>Num.</hi> 24.17. <hi>of Christ smiting the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Moab, and destroying all the sons of Seth.</hi> And he gives this for a second answer, that if they would be but obedient, they should see how his Apostolick power was ready to avenge disobedience.</p>
               <p>Since he hath such back friends and open enemies in this Church, it is no wonder if he write so doubtingly of them how he should finde them: and that he staid no longer with them when he came to them, as his stay was very little. His former Epistle, as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent by severall passages in this, had wrought them into a reasonable good temper: but mischief now was crept on them again, at least there were some that were tampering to bring it on. In regard therefore of that vilifying that these false teachers, enemies of him and God, did set him at, and sought to make him odious and contemptible in the eyes of the Church, he is put to it to make his vindication, and that, as the matter requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with much largenesse and earnestnesse. He therefore copiously discourseth, what God had done by him, what he had suffered for God, and what he had done for the Churches; in any of which things let any of these that reviled him, come near him if they could. In relating the passages of his life, he mentioneth many things, of which there is no mention in his story in the Acts of the Apostles: and frequenly in his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, he speaketh of his folly in boasting, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Bear with me a little in my

folly,</hi> and see <hi>ver.</hi> 16, 17. because indeed mans boasting of himself is folly, and they would be ready to censure his so, therefore he styles his by that title, though it were not folly in him, but a needfull and an holy vindication of himself and of his Ministry.</p>
               <p>After he had sent away this Epistle, by <hi>Titus, Erastus</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> if our conjecture fail not, and had given notice to the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of his speedy coming to them, and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to get their collections ready against he came, he provideth for his journey into <hi>Syria,</hi> which he had intended so long: partly to visit the Churches in these parts, and partly to bring up the collections that he had got for the poor of <hi>Iudea:</hi> which he had promised to the three Ministers of the Circumision, <hi>Peter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> that he would be carefull of, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.10.</p>

Therefore we have superscribed it, The 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>Nero,</hi> and of <hi>Christ</hi> the 56<hi rend="sup">th</hi>.</p>
                  <p>When we come to speak of the Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> which we shall meet with in our way very shortly, we shall say something of the names of these men [for many of them will meet us there:] only we cannot misse <hi>Timotheus</hi> here without some notice taken of him, and some <hi>quaere</hi> how he came here. The last year <hi>Paul</hi> left him at <hi>Ephesus</hi> when himself came thence, and being come thence into <hi>Macedonia</hi> he sends him an Epistle with his earnest desire in it, that he would stay there still upon that needfull imployment upon which he was left, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. how then is <hi>Timothy</hi> now got to him into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> so that he is with him at his setting away from <hi>Philippi?</hi> We have not indeed any intimation that <hi>Paul</hi> sent for him away, as we have of his sending for <hi>Titus</hi> whom he left in <hi>Creete,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendedly for a longer time: but it is very probable that <hi>Paul</hi> designing to have sailed for <hi>Syria,</hi> came near to him: and there discovering the danger that was laid in his way by the Jews, which might also have infolded <hi>Timothy,</hi> he brought him away back again with him, and so both returned into <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and now winter is over, they are setting for <hi>Asia</hi> again.</p>
                  <p>But when <hi>Paul</hi> and this his company are all going for <hi>Asia</hi> together, why should they not set out together, but these go before and tarry at <hi>Troas,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> and some other of his company come after? Nay they were all to meet at <hi>Troas</hi> as it appeareth, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. why might they not then have gone all together to <hi>Troas?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reason of this was, because <hi>Paul</hi> himself was to go by <hi>Corinth:</hi> and not minding to stay there but very little, because he hastened to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> he would not take his whole train thither, but sends them away the next way they could go to <hi>Troas,</hi> himself promising and resolving to be speedily with them there. He had promised a long time to the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> to come unto them, and he had newly sent word in that Epistle that he had lately sent, that now his coming would be speedy, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Behold the third time I am ready to come to you:</hi> and <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.1. <hi>This is the third time that I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you:</hi> Not that he had been there twice before, for since his first departing thence [when he had staied there a long time together, at his first planting of the Gospel in that place] there is neither mention nor probability of his being there again, but this was the third time <hi>that he was in coming,</hi> having promised and intended a journey thither once before, but was prevented, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.15, 16, 17. But now he not only promiseth by the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle that he will come, but staketh the three Brethren that he had sent thither, for witnesses and sureties of that promise, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1, 2. that in the mouth of those witnesses his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise might be established and assured.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:59067:70"/>Now the time is come that he makes good his promise, and whilest the rest of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany go directly the next cut to <hi>Troas,</hi> he himself and <hi>Luke,</hi> and whom else he thought good to retain with him, go about by <hi>Corinth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now to look a little further into the reason of their thus parting company, and of <hi>Pauls</hi> short stay at <hi>Corinth</hi> when he came there, we may take into thoughts [besides how much he hastned to <hi>Ierusalem</hi>] the jealousie that he had that he should not finde all things at <hi>Corinth</hi> so comfortable to himself, and so creditable to them, before those that should come with him, as he desired. He hath many passages in the second Epistle that he wrote to them, that glance that way: For though as to the generall there was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation wrought among them upon the receiving of his first Epistle, and thereupon he speaketh very excellent things of them, yet were there not a few that thought basely of him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.1, 2. and traduced him and his Doctrine, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11. &amp; 12. and gave him cause to suspect that his boasting of that Church to the Churches of <hi>Macedonia</hi> might come off but indifferently, if the <hi>Macedonians</hi> should come with him to see how all things were there, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.4. And therefore it was but the good policy of just fear, grief, and prudence to send them by another way, and he had very just cause to stay but a while when he came there.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Corinth</hi> in his short stay there, he writeth</p>

               <head>THE EPISTLE TO THE <hi>ROMANS,</hi>
               </head>
               <p>as hath been well supposed by some of the Ancients, is asserted by the <hi>postscript,</hi> and may be concluded from these observations.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he saith, that he is now going to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to bring to the Saints that benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that they of <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Achaia</hi> had collected for them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.26. The word <hi>Achaia</hi> tels us that he now was sure of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> contribution, which he was not sure of, till he came there.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That he commendeth to the Romans, <hi>Phaebe</hi> a servant of the Church of <hi>Cenchraea, Rom.</hi> 16.1. which <hi>Cenchraea</hi> was a place belonging to <hi>Corinth,</hi> as was observed before, though at some few miles distance.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That he calleth <hi>Erastus, Chamberlain of the City,</hi> Rom. 16.23. of whom it is said <hi>Erastus abode at Corinth,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.</p>
               <p n="4">4. That he calleth <hi>Gaius his host,</hi> or the man with whom he lodged, and <hi>the host of the whole Church,</hi> or in whose house strangers had their intertainment, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.23. who was a <hi>Corinthian,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.14. And hence it appeareth that <hi>Gaius</hi> of <hi>Derbe,</hi> who was one of those that were gone before to <hi>Troas,</hi> was one man, and <hi>Gaius</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> was another.</p>
               <p>It is true indeed that the greetings of some men were sent in this Epistle which were not with <hi>Paul</hi> at this present in <hi>Corinth,</hi> as <hi>Timothies,</hi> Rom. 16.20. who was gone to <hi>Troas:</hi> and <hi>Sosipaters,</hi> who was gone thither also [for he I suppose is the same with <hi>Sopater</hi> of <hi>Berea,</hi> Act. 20.4.] and this might seem to infringe the truth of this opinion that holdeth that this Epistle was written from <hi>Corinth:</hi> But when it is considered how lately <hi>Paul</hi> and these men parted, and that it is past doubt that he would acquaint them before their parting of his intentions to send to <hi>Rome,</hi> it is no difficulty to conceive how their saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions inserted into that Epistle.</p>
               <p>There are indeed some that confesse that it was written from <hi>Corinth,</hi> but not at this time but at another, namely in that time when <hi>Paul</hi> travelled <hi>Greece,</hi> of which journey there is mention <hi>Act.</hi> 20. in which time, among other places, they conceive he came to <hi>Corinth</hi> and there wrote this Epistle. But 1. it may very well be questioned whether he were at <hi>Corinth</hi> in these three moneths travels or no. For whereas he had promised to call on them as he went to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> 1 Cor. 16.7. [which he intended when he travelled those three moneths, but that he discovered that the Jews lay in wait for him] he excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth himself for not coming according to that promise, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.16, 17. And if it were granted that he was at <hi>Corinth</hi> at that time, yet 2. he could not write this Epistle at that time, because when he wrote it, he knew the contribution of the <hi>Corinthian</hi> Church was then ready, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.26. which when he travelled <hi>Greece,</hi> either indeed was not so, or at least he knew not that it was, as appeareth copiously in his second Epistle to that Church.</p>
               <p>The Apostle in this most sublime Epistle, clears fully and divinely, the two great my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of the Gospel, <hi>Righteousnesse by faith, and the calling of the Gentiles.</hi> And in the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:59067:71"/>
handling of these he handles the great points Originall sin, Election, and casting off of the Jews. He laies this position down concerning the first, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.17. That in <hi>the Gospel is revealed the Righteousnesse of God [justifying,</hi> as in the Law was revealed his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse or justice <hi>condemning</hi>] and that <hi>from faith</hi> [of immediate innixion upon God as was <hi>Adams</hi> before his fall, and as was that which the Jews owned in God] <hi>to faith,</hi> in the righteousnesse of another: namely <hi>Christ.</hi> This way of justification he proveth first by shewing how far all men both by nature and action are from possibility of being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified of or by themselves, which he cleareth by the horrid sinfulnesse of the heathen, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. [a large proof of which might be read at <hi>Rome</hi> at that very instant:] and little lesse sinfulnesse of the Jews though they had the Law, <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. &amp; 3. and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.30. that God justifieth the circumcision <hi>by faith</hi> [and not by works, as they stood upon it] and the uncircumcision <hi>through faith</hi> [for all their works that had been so abominable, and that seemed so contrary to justification.] In <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. he taketh up the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom the Jews reputed most highly justified by his works, for they had this saying of him <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Abraham perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the Law every whit:</hi> but he proveth that he found nothing by his own works, but by beleeving he found all. In <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. he proves the imputation of <hi>Christs</hi> righteousnesse for Justification, by the parallel of the imputation of <hi>Adams</hi> sin for condemnation: Not at all intending to assert that as many as were condemned by <hi>Adam,</hi> were freed from that condemnation by the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> but purposely and only to prove the one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation by the other.</p>
               <p>It was a strange doctrine in the ears of a Jew to hear of being justified by the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse of another, therefore he proves it by the like, mens being condemned for and by the unrighteousnesse of another. Two close couched passages clear what he aimeth at: The first is in <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, &amp;c. <hi>Wherefore as by one man sinne entred into the world, &amp;c.</hi> The word <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>As,</hi> properly requireth a <hi>So</hi> to follow it, as you may observe it doth, in <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 18, 19. but here there is no such thing expressed, therefore it is so to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood: and the Apostles words to be construed to this sense. <hi>Wherefore it is,</hi> or the case is here as it was in <hi>Adam, as by one man sin entered into the world,</hi> &amp;c. there imputation, so here. The second is <hi>ver.</hi> 18. in the Originall <hi>verbatim</hi> thus. <hi>As by the transgression of one, upon all men to condemnation, so by the righteousnesse of one, upon all men to justification of life.</hi> What, upon all men? Our Translation hath added some words to clear the sense, but the shortnesse of the Apostles style doth better clear his intent: namely to intimate imputation: as speaking to this purpose, <hi>As by the transgression of one there was that that redounded to all to condemnation, so by the righteousnesse of one there is that that redoundeth to all to justification of life:</hi> And to clear that he meaneth not that all that were condemned by <hi>Adams</hi> Fall were redeemed by <hi>Christ,</hi> he at once sheweth the descent of Originall sin, and the descent of it for all the death and righteousnesse of <hi>Christ, Quae tamen profuerunt antequam fuerunt.</hi> Ver. 13. <hi>For till the Law sinne was in the world: but sinne is not impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted where there is no Law. Neverthelesse death reigned from Adam to Moses.</hi> By what Law was sinne sinne and did death reign, when the Law was not yet given? Namely by that Law that was given to <hi>Adam,</hi> and he brake, the guilt of which violation descends to all.</p>
               <p>Having to the end of the fifth Chapter stated and proved Justification by faith, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 6, &amp; 7, &amp; 8. he speaks of the state of persons justified, which though they be not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sinne, yet their state compared with <hi>Adams,</hi> even whilest he was sinnelesse, it is farre better then his: He invested in a created, finite, changeable humane righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; they in the righteousnesse of God uncreate, infinite, unchangeable. He having the principles of his holinesse and righteousnesse in his own nature, they theirs conveyed from <hi>Christ:</hi> He having neither <hi>Christ</hi> nor the Spirit, but left to himself and his naturall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; they having both. <hi>See</hi> Chap. 8.1, 2, 9, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the nineteenth verse of <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. he begins upon the second mystery that he hath to treat upon, the calling of the Gentiles, whom he cals <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:59067:71"/>
their Ordinances were according to child-like age of the Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the stature of the fulnesse of <hi>Christs</hi> mysticall Body, was in the bringing in of the Gentiles. Being to handle this great point of the Calling of the Gentiles and Rejection of the Jews, he begins at the bottome, at the great doctrine of Predestination, which he handles from <hi>ver.</hi> 29. of <hi>Chap</hi> 8. to <hi>Chap.</hi> 9.24. and then he fals upon the other.

And in this unbelief must they lie till the fulnesse of the Gentiles be come in, and then all Gods <hi>Israel</hi> is compleated.</p>
               <p>The most that he salutes in the last Chapter, appear to have been of the Jewish Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the most of them [though now at <hi>Rome</hi>] yet sometime to have been of <hi>Pauls</hi> company and acquaintance in some other place. The expulsion of the Jews out of <hi>Rome</hi> by <hi>Claudius</hi> Decree, might very well bring many of them into his converse, as well as it did <hi>Priscilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila</hi> whom he names first among them. <hi>Epenetus</hi> was one of his own converts of <hi>Achaia; Mary</hi> had bestowed much labour on him, yet he hitherto had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been near <hi>Rome.</hi> He that would dispute the point of the first planter of the Gospel at <hi>Rome,</hi> might do well to make the first muster of his thoughts here: And whereas the Apostle speaks of the saith of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church as spoken of throughout the world, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. it is very questionable whether he look to the times before the Decree of <hi>Claudius,</hi> or those since <hi>Claudius</hi> death, when all the scattered were returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and many of those that had come out unbeleeving Jews had returned Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans thither; as I beleeve the case was of <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla:</hi> and some converted in other places had now taken up their residence there, as <hi>Epenetus, Andronicus,</hi> and <hi>Iunia,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Those whose salutations he sendeth thither, may be the better judged of, who they were, by observing who were of his retinue at this time, which are named, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.4. as 1. <hi>Timothy.</hi> 2. <hi>Lucius,</hi> who seemeth to be <hi>Luke,</hi> called now by a Latine name, in an Epistle to the Latines.

It may be observed from hence, that strangers and travellers were intertained in a place near the Synagogue [compare <hi>Act.</hi> 18.7.] which was as a publick Xenodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chion or receptacle of strangers, at the charge of the Congregation: which laudable cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome is almost apparent was transplanted into the Christian Churches in those times: as compare such passages as those, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.4.

Out of which how <hi>Baronius</hi> can bring the beginning of <hi>Florus</hi> his Government to be in the tenth of <hi>Nero,</hi> as he doth, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand not: for if the twelfth Year of <hi>Nero</hi> were <hi>Florus</hi> his second, then the eleventh was his first.</p>
                  <p>And now let us take in some things more, which we must apply to these times mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to help us in the inquest we are about.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith, that <hi>when Portius Festus came into Felix room in the Government of Iudea, the chief of the Iews of Caesarea went to Rome to accuse Felix; and he had been cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly punished for his unjust dealing with the Iews, had not Nero been very favourable to him, at the intreaty of his brother Pallas, who was then very much in Caesars esteem.</hi> Antiq. lib. 20 cap. 7.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The same <hi>Iosephus</hi> also speaking of the Government of <hi>Festus</hi> in <hi>Iudea,</hi> he first mentioneth how he found the Country infested with rebels and robbers whom he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw: then he relateth how King <hi>Agrippa</hi> built his Palace so at <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> as that it overtopt the Temple Courts: which the Jews disliking built a counterwall to hinder the prospect, that it should not view their service and actions in the Temple. At this <hi>Agrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa</hi> and <hi>Festus</hi> took distast, and <hi>Festus</hi> commanded that the wall should be pulled down: but the Jews desired they might send Agents to <hi>Rome</hi> about this matter, which they did. And when <hi>Nero</hi> heard the case, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. <hi>He did not only pardon the thing done: but he also consented to suffer the building so to stand: vouchsafing this at the intreaty of his wife Poppaea, for she was devout,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Antiq.</hi> lib. 20. cap. 8. Observe the last words, <hi>At the intreaty of his wife Poppaea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The same <hi>Iosephus</hi> again relateth a journey of his own to <hi>Rome</hi> in these words: <hi>When I was six and twenty years old I went to Rome upon this occasion. When Felix was Governour of Iudea, he sent certain Priests my neer acquaintance, and very good men for a small cause to Rome to appear before Caesar. For whose deliverance I desiring to finde some means went to Rome, and there by the means of a certain Iew, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. I came to be known to Poppaea Caesars Wife.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Baronius</hi> doth revile <hi>Iosephus</hi> here as if he had forgot his own age: <hi>Videas in his</hi> [saith he] <hi>quae suae aetatis sunt, suo ipsius testimonio convinci, annorum sex turpiter errant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m.</hi> And wherein? <hi>Quia affirmat se agentem suum supra vigesimum sextum sub Faelice Iudaeae praeside Romam venisse.</hi> But <hi>Iosephus</hi> saith no such word. He saith indeed that he went to <hi>Rome</hi> to labour the deliverance of some men that <hi>Felix</hi> had sent thither in the time of his Government, but that <hi>Felix</hi> was in his Government when he went thither he saith not at all.</p>
                  <p>And now to take up what we have to observe upon these things that have been spoken.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is true indeed, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> witnesseth, that <hi>Pallas</hi> the brother of <hi>Felix,</hi> who had been <hi>Claudius</hi> his great favourite, and so <hi>Nero</hi>'s also in <hi>Claudius</hi> time, did wane and decrease somewhat in his favour in a very short time after his entrance into his reign: but he was not utterly laid flat, and out at all, till after <hi>Poppaea</hi> came into favour and amorousnesse, who forwarded the death of <hi>Agrippina,</hi> and the bringing down of those that were of her party as <hi>Pallas</hi> was. Therefore the power of <hi>Pallas</hi> with the Emperour seemeth to be expired in <hi>Nero</hi>'s fifth year, in which <hi>Agrippina</hi> was slain. And by this account we cannot extend <hi>Felix</hi> his escape for his brother <hi>Pallas</hi> his sake, beyond <hi>Nero</hi>'s fourth Year. For considering <hi>Poppaeas</hi> prevalency with the Emperour, when once she became his Paramour, and considering her detestation of <hi>Agrippina</hi> and her faction of which <hi>Pallas</hi> was the chief, we cannot cast <hi>Felix</hi> his discharge for <hi>Pallas</hi> his sake, beyond <hi>Nero</hi>'s fourth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Paul</hi> lay two years prisoner at <hi>Caesarea</hi> under <hi>Felix:</hi> Act. 24.27. <hi>After two years Porti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>me into Felix room.</hi> Many are the conjectures about these two years. <hi>Baronius</hi> saith, it was <hi>Expleto biennio Neronis. Magister Historiae Scholasticae,</hi> saith it was <hi>Biennium ab accusatione Felicis a Iudaeis. A Lapide</hi> cares not to think that <hi>Biennium hoc
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:59067:73"/>
inchoandum a praefectura Felicis in Iudea, nam ante illud praefuerat Trachonitidi Batanaeae &amp; Gandanitidi,</hi> &amp;c. But it is most proper to hold, that these <hi>two years</hi> mean the time of <hi>Pauls</hi> being a prisoner under <hi>Felix</hi> from the time of his apprehension under <hi>Lysias</hi> the chief Captain, till <hi>Felix</hi> his going out of his Government: and so it is held by <hi>Beda, Beza, Salmeron, Onuphrius</hi> and others. And this is so proper and sutable to the intent and discourse of <hi>Luke,</hi> that it needeth no illustration or proof of it: and it is most agreeable to the Scriptures manner of accounting in all other places.</p>
                  <p>These two things then being thus concluded on, it will follow that <hi>Pauls</hi> apprehension was in <hi>Nero</hi>'s second, and <hi>Felix</hi> went out of Office in <hi>Nero</hi>'s fourth, before <hi>Poppaea</hi> was yet got into her potency. And the accounting of <hi>Pauls</hi> to years imprisonment under <hi>Felix</hi> to be thus. At <hi>Pentecost</hi> in <hi>Nero</hi>'s second he is apprehended, and at <hi>Pentecost</hi> in <hi>Nero</hi>'s third he had been a year prisoner: and at <hi>Peneecost</hi> in <hi>Nero</hi>'s fourth his two years are up: and that spring it was that <hi>Felix</hi> went out of Office, and went to <hi>Rome</hi> to make his answer, and <hi>Pallas</hi> his brother not yet utterly out of favour makes his peace. And now let us draw up the Chronology of <hi>Nero</hi>'s time to the full, according to these eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and as referreth to our occasion.</p>

                     <hi>ACTS CHAP. XXI.</hi> from <hi>Ver. 17.</hi> to the end of the Chapter.</head>
                  <p>PAul cometh to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> at the feast of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> when the City was now full of conflux to that festivall. He resorteth instantly to <hi>Iames</hi> the residentiary Apostle of the Circumcision, for holding correspondency sake; and there he shews him the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and fruit of his Ministry among the Gentiles. Which both by <hi>Iames</hi> and the Elders that were with him is well approved of, as to the thing it self: but they certifie him of what complaints they heard from the Jews against him, for crying down of the rites of <hi>Moses,</hi> especially Circumcision, <hi>That thou teachest all the Iews which are among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to forsake Moses, saying, that they ought not to circumcise their children,</hi> ver. 21. Now because thousands of the Jews which beleeved were yet zealous of the Law, this gave much offence. But did <hi>Paul</hi> teach thus or not? No doubt he did, and it behoved him so to do: nor does, nor can <hi>Iames</hi> except against the doctrine: for though it is true that he and <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apostles permitted compliance with some of the Jewish rites for peace sake for a while, as there is an example in this very place, yea <hi>Paul</hi> himself cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:59067:74"/>
                     <hi>Timothy</hi> upon that reason; yet the use of Circumcision, as these that stood upon it, used it, was utterly inconsistent with the Gospel. Hear this Apostles Doctrine, <hi>Behold I Paul say unto you, that if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing. For I testifie again to every man that is circumcised, that he is a debtour to the whole Law,</hi> Gal. 5.2. A converted Jew would have his sonne circumcised: <hi>Paul</hi> asks him a reason; what can he answer, but it looks after some justification by it? as their own Authors speak their thoughts: <hi>He that is circumcised is perfect.</hi> And, <hi>He that is circumcised shall not go to Gehinnom.</hi> And, <hi>I said unto thee, in thy blood live, Ezek.</hi> 16.6. <hi>This is the blood of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision,</hi> &amp;c. Tanchum. in <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. &amp; 18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They looked indeed upon Circumcision notion as an admission into the Covenant: and thereupon the father of the child at his Circumcision constantly used these words, <hi>Blessed be thou O Lord our God who hast sanctified us by his Commandments, and commanded us to bring the child into the Covenant of our father Abraham. And they that stood by said, As thou hast brought him into the Covenant, so bring him into the Law and into the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber.</hi> Jerus. in Beracoth. fol. 13. col. 1. But withall they looked upon this Covenant as a Covenant of works, for, as we observed before, they reputed <hi>Abraham</hi> himself so justified. Good cause therefore had <hi>Paul</hi> to stand out against the convert Jews circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising their children, as whereby the Doctrine of Justification by faith was utterly ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and made of no effect. And here by the way let us conceive we heard <hi>Paul</hi> and one of these parents disputing upon this point. Circumcise not thy child, saith <hi>Paul,</hi> for if thou doest thou laiest an obligation upon him to observe the whole Law: and this may note to us that the Sacrament carried an obligation with it, and obliged an Infant, though he knew not what Law or obligation meant: Baptism is for obligation as well as this, and a childe capable of the obligation though he understand not what it means. I, but saies the Parent, I will not look upon it, as in way to Justification, I will only use it for the childes admission into the Covenant of grace. If Infants Baptism were not now in use for such a purpose, let one that denies it, tell me, what <hi>Paul</hi> had to answer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iames</hi> urgeth not <hi>Paul</hi> at all to any publick recantation of his Doctrine, but adviseth him, by purifying himself and Judaizing a little in the Temple, to give some publick te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony for their satisfaction, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>at he was not such an enemy to <hi>Moses</hi> as he was repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: which he agreeth to. For the Temple rites might have better plea, while the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple stood, then Circumcision, which was none of them. On the second or third day of his Purification, some <hi>Asian</hi> Jews raise a tumult against him. It is not so properly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, <hi>And when the seven daies were almost ended,</hi> ver. 27. as rather, <hi>And as the seven daies were to have been accomplished,</hi> the computing of these twelve daies mentioned <hi>chap.</hi> 24.11. inforce that they should be so interpreted.</p>
                  <p>They found him in the second Court of the Temple <hi>the Court of the women,</hi> whither no Heathen came [though they might come into the outer Court, called <hi>the mountain of the House</hi>] and thither they supposed and pretended that he had brought a Gentile, <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phimus an Ephesian:</hi> For which he is fallen upon with that they called <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>The rebels beaten,</hi> stripes without number, the people falling pell mell upon him. Which was the way [as the Jews records inform us] that the Priests were dealt withall, that came into the next court above this, when any of them was deprehended there in their uncleannesse: they never stood upon it, to bring him to judiciall triall, but his fellows fell upon him, with the fagot sticks of the Altar, or what came to hand, and mawled him with blows without measure even unto death: And so had <hi>Paul</hi> been served now had not the <hi>Roman</hi> Commander come and been his rescue. Yet did he suppose him an offender, and questions him whether he were not that <hi>Egyptian</hi> that not long before that time had made an insurrection. <hi>Iosephus</hi> giveth his story, Antiq. <hi>lib.</hi> 20. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. thus. <hi>At that time there cometh one to Ierusalem out of Aegypt, pretending himself to be a Prophet: and he counselled the common people, that they should go with him to Mount Olivet, and that there he would shew them how at his command the walls of Ierusalem would fall: But</hi> Felix <hi>understanding this, sent some horse and foot against them, and slew</hi> 400 <hi>of them</hi> [our text here saies 4000] <hi>and took two hundred prisoners.</hi>

The <hi>postscript</hi> of this Epistle both in the <hi>Greek, Syriack, Arabick,</hi> and divers other Translations, doth generally date it from <hi>Rome: Beza</hi> from <hi>Antioch: Erasmus</hi> from <hi>Ephesus,</hi> but all upon conjecture: for there is no intimation in the Epistle it self of the time or place of its writing: <hi>Beza</hi> upon these words in <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 2. <hi>And all the brethren which are with me,</hi> saith thus, <hi>Puto sic totum Antiochenae Ecclesiae Presbyterium significari, &amp; inde scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptam

hanc Epistolam,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I think by this he meaneth the whole Presbytery of the Church of Antioch, and that this Epistle was written from thence, at that time that passed between Paul and Barnabas their return into Asia from their first journey forth, and the coming of those troubles to Antioch,</hi> Acts 14.28. But that Apostacy in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es which the Apostle crieth out against in this Epistle and in others, was not then begun; and moreover it may well be questioned whether the Churches of <hi>Galatia</hi> were then planted. And the former answer, may likewise be given to the opinion that this Epistle was written from <hi>Ephesus:</hi> namely that at the time of <hi>Pauls</hi> being at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> the Apostacy which ere long did sorely and almost Epidemically in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest the Churches, was but then beginning. And this is one reason why I suppose it written from <hi>Rome,</hi> at this time that we are upon, because that gangrene in the Eastern Churches was now come to ripenesse, as it appears by the second Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> which was written this same year: See 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15.</p>
               <p>False teachers had brought back the <hi>Galatians</hi> from the simplicity of the Gospel, to their old Ceremonious performances again, and to reliance upon the works of the Law for Justification: which miscarriage the Apostle taketh sharply to task in this Epistle. And first he vindicates his Apostleship as no whit inferiour to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> the Ministers of the Circumcision, and those that chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seemed to be pillars, and he shews how these approved of him and it: And then he most divinely states the nature of the Law, at which was the great stumbling; and especially speaks to that point that they most stood upon, their <hi>living in it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Lord had laid a stone in <hi>Sion,</hi> which the Jews could not step over, but stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at, even to this day: and that is that which is said in <hi>Levit.</hi> 18.5. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.11. and in other places, which the Apostle also toucheth in this Epistle, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.12. from whence they concluded that no living, no justification but by the works of the Law. The Apostle in the third Chapter of this Epistle laies down two conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions that determine the case, and resolves all into faith. The first is in <hi>ver.</hi> 17. namely that the Law was not given to crosse the Covenant of grace, but to be subservient to it. The second in <hi>ver.</hi> 10. that the Law did plainly shew of it self that no man could perform it, but it left a man under the curse. Observe that he saith not, As many <hi>as fail</hi> of the works of the Law, but As many <hi>as are</hi> of the works of the Law: shewing that the Law did not only denounce a curse upon all that performed it not, but plainly demonstrated that none could perform it, and so left all under a curse: and these words, <hi>Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things,</hi> &amp;c. conclude both. So that the Law was not given for justification, but to be subservient to the Covenant of Justification: not to crosse the Covenant but to serve it, not purposely to leave under the curse, but to shew the curse, and to drive men to get from under it. So that men might live <hi>in it,</hi> but not <hi>by it.</hi> It was the way in which men were to go to seek for Justification, but it was not the cause or means whereby they were justified. See <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.5. The Jews made the Morall Law crosse to the Covenant of grace, whilest they sought to be justified by works: and they made the Ceremoniall Law crosse the Morall, whilest they resolved all duty into Ceremony: and so the Law which in it self was holy and pure and good, they turned to death unto themselves by their abuse. They might have lived <hi>in</hi> the Morall Law [had they used it aright,] though not <hi>by</hi> it: for the more a man sets himself to the exact performance of it, the more he sees he cannot perform it, and therefore he is driven the more to Christ: But they resolved all into Ceremonious performance, and so lost sincerity toward the Morall, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Ceremoniall Law good in it self, became to them <hi>Statutes not good, and Iudgements wherein they could not live,</hi> Ezek. 20.25.</p>

kindled. <hi>Abolendo rumori Nero subdidit reos, &amp; quaesitissimis paenis affecit, quos per flagitia invisos, vulgus Christianos appellat. Nero to stop that report, brought in as guilty those who were called Christians, and tortured them with exquisite torments. The author of that name was Christ, who in the reign of Tiberius was put to death by Pontius Pilate. Repressaque in praesens exitiabilis superstitio, rursus erumpebat, non modo per Iudaeam, originem ejus mali, sed per urbem etiam; quò cuncta undique a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocia aut pudenda confluunt, celebranturque.

For the Englishing of this, the words <hi>repressa in praesens</hi> will breed some dispute; as doubtfull, whether they mean that the Christian Religion was suppressed by <hi>Nero</hi> at that time when he inflicted those tortures upon them, pretending them guilty for firing the City, which was in his tenth year, but it brake out again after, for all that suppression; or that they mean, that that Religion had been suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in former time, but now by that tenth year of <hi>Nero</hi> was broken out again, and he fals upon it anew. The words you may winde to whether construction you will, construing them either, That dangerous superstition <hi>suppressed for the present broke out again:</hi> or That dangerous superstition <hi>having been suppressed for a time, was broke out again</hi>; or, <hi>that had been suppressed till the present:</hi> Now though there be this dubiousnesse in that phrase, yet the observation of these things may state it, that there was some such suppression of Christianity before that open persecution that broke out in his tenth year. 1.

There is mention of <hi>Pomponia Graecina</hi> tried for her life, about the beginning of <hi>Nero</hi>'s reign, for matter of Religion as we mentioned before. 3. This imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Epaphras,</hi> and it may be of <hi>Aristarchus,</hi> at this time, and certainly of <hi>Timothy</hi> presently after, may also confirm it: for what should these men be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned for but for Religion? It is very probable therefore that <hi>Nero</hi> had by some Act or Edict suppressed Christianity, not only at <hi>Rome,</hi> but also in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> as it seemeth by that clause in <hi>Tacitus, Rursus erumpebat non modò per Iudaeam,</hi> &amp;c. and if so, that might be a forwarder of that defection that was so generall in the Churches of the Jews that had received the Gospel; they falling to <hi>Moses</hi> again, or joyning the adhesion to the Law with the profession of the Gospel: for thus hiding their Christianity, they might retain their liberty of their Christianity such as it was, the Religion of the Jews not being at all suppressed by him: However, if there were such a suppression at <hi>Rome,</hi> as it is very like there was, <hi>Pauls</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from the Lions mouth, was the more remarkable, since he was to answer not only to his accusers about his profession, but before a judge that was prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced against it so deeply.</p>
               <p>But since we have heard of no stirring at <hi>Rome</hi> of all this time to such a time, nor any mention of any imprisoning but only of <hi>Paul,</hi> how comes the matter to wax so hot now, since <hi>Nero</hi>'s heat against Christianity seemeth to have been some years, or at least a good while ago? Here we cannot but remember that passage in the Epistle to the <hi>Philippians</hi> so lately written: <hi>Philip</hi> 1.15, 16. <hi>Some preach Christ even of envy and strife, and some also of good will. The one preach Christ of contention not sincerity, supposing to adde affliction to my bonds.</hi> By which it may be conjectured, that some enemies of <hi>Pauls</hi> and his companies, taking oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of <hi>Nero</hi>'s declaration against Christianity did bussle and make ado in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gospel, aiming at nothing more then this, that hereby the ringleaders in the Gospel <hi>Paul</hi> and his company [as no doubt they were noted so to be] might be the more narrowly looked after: and this might well be some occasion of the imprisonment of <hi>Epaphras</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> at this time, and of <hi>Aristarchus,</hi> if so be he were not a prisoner before.</p>

THis year is <hi>Timothy</hi> a prisoner, and <hi>Paul</hi> himself at liberty, for his two years imprisonment expired the later end of the last year or the beginning of this. You have intimation of this, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.23. where he saith, <hi>Know ye, that our bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Timothy is set at liberty: with whom if he come shortly I will see you:</hi> For I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not interpret the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> otherwise then in reference to restraint; and then we may out of this passage observe that <hi>Timothy</hi> had been a prisoner, and that the <hi>Hebrews</hi> had known of his imprisonment, but now he was at liberty, and <hi>Paul</hi> too, ready to come away with him when he should come. He had written to the <hi>Philippians</hi> that he hoped shortly to send <hi>Timothy</hi> to them, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.19. and to <hi>Philemon</hi> to provide a lodging for him, for he hoped ere long to come into those parts, <hi>Philem. ver.</hi> 22. By which we may conclude, that upon his inlargement he intended not to have staied long at <hi>Rome,</hi> or that <hi>Timothy</hi> at the least should not have been long from them, but that his imprisonment, as it proved, hindred them both. Therefore we may not cast his commitment beyound this year; but how long he lay under restraint we cannot tell, only we may conceive him at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty the next, for in that year we suppose the writing of <hi>the Epistle to the Hebrews</hi> which speaks of his inlargement.</p>
               <p>In our thoughts about <hi>Nero</hi>'s suppressing Christianity, and these mens bonds thereabout, we may also look with admiration at the wondrous workings of God: observe, that even at these times there was Christianity in <hi>Nero</hi>'s houshold, <hi>Philip.</hi> 4.22.</p>
               <p>This year some occurrences befalling in this our own Country of <hi>England,</hi> though they are besides the argument that we are upon, yet may they not unfitly be taken into mention for Countries sake. <hi>Suetonius Paulinus</hi> was now Generall for the <hi>Romans</hi> here. He assails to take the <hi>Ile of Man, Incolis validam &amp; recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum perfugarum,</hi> saith <hi>Tacitus: Strong in the inhabitants and a refuge for fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</hi> He bringing on his men near the shore, findes an Army guarding and ready to forbid his landing. Among the men, there were women running up and down; <hi>In modum furiarum, veste ferali, crinibus dejectis faces praeferebant. Like furies in a dreery garb, with their hair about their ears, and they carried torches.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> souldiers for a while stood amazed at such a sight, but at last falling on, they enter and destroy them, and possesse and Garrison the Iland. <hi>Excisique luci saevis superstitionibus sacri; Nam cruore captivo adolere aras, &amp; fibris hominum con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulere Deo fas habebant. And they cut down the groves that were devoted to bloody su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition: For they used to sacrifice captives at their Altars, and to look into their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by way of auguration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is a remarkable and true saying of <hi>Pliny</hi> concerning <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> That it was a Country <hi>Quae sparsa congregaret imperia, ritusque molliret, &amp; tot populorum discordes ferasque linguas sermonis commercio contraheret ad colloquia, &amp; humanita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem homini daret.</hi> Nat. Hist. <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. which in short is this, <hi>that it civilized the world, and taught barbarous Nations humanity.</hi> A strange assertion, if we consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the barbarous bloudinesse and superstitions of the <hi>Romans</hi> themselves; yet if we look upon the thing it self, it is very true, they being a people of Learning, Discipline and Education, and planting these wheresoever they got footing. And this was one means in the Lords providence, whose waies are past finding out, to harrow the worlds ruggednesse, and to fit it the better for the sowing of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel. In what temper our Land of <hi>Brittain</hi> was, as to civility, before they came in, may be guessed by this garb of the <hi>Ile of Man,</hi> so near relating to it, if we had no more evidence.</p>
               <p>Whilest <hi>Suetonius</hi> was thus busied here, he hears of a revolt and rebellion in <hi>Brittain,</hi> caused partly by the cruell exaction of <hi>Decimus Catus</hi> the Governour, who revived some impositions that <hi>Claudius</hi> the Emperour had remitted, partly by the grinding usury and exaction of <hi>Seneca,</hi> who having put them, even unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:59067:80"/>
to take vast summes of money of his, to most unsufferable usury, he now called it and the use in, with all extremity and mercilesnesse: And partly by an unhappy obsequiousnesse of <hi>Prasutagus</hi> King of the <hi>Iceni,</hi> or at least by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy abusing of his obsequiousnesse: For he dying, and leaving <hi>Nero</hi> and his own two daughters his heirs by Will, the <hi>Roman</hi> Centurions as in claim to <hi>Nero</hi>'s Legacy, ransack and catch all they can, and pull his Kingdom all to pieces, and abuse his wife and two daughters barbarously and inhumanely: and spare not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his friends, kindred or Nobles. This stirres all to commotion, which is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly prosecuted by <hi>Bondicea</hi> or <hi>Bunduica</hi> the widow of the King deceased, in so much that they destroy the Colony at <hi>Camalodunum,</hi> the <hi>Roman</hi> Garrison and asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates at <hi>London,</hi> and the like at <hi>Verulam:</hi> in all to the number of 70000 persons: <hi>Suetonius</hi> at last comes in, and fights them, they being near upon 230000 in armes under <hi>Bunduica,</hi> he routeth them, slayes upon 80000 of them: <hi>Bunduica</hi> for vexation poisons her self: and the <hi>Roman</hi> destroyes with fire and sword all the Towns before him that were of the adverse party, or adhered to it: Divers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degies are mentioned by the Historians, that relate these bloody occurrences as presages of it: as the sea bloody, strange voices and howlings heard, sights seen in the <hi>Thames,</hi> of houses under water, as a Colony overturned, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>and that he having delivered it where <hi>Paul</hi> had appointed him, went away to <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>Chaldaea,</hi> because <hi>Peter</hi> there, mentioneth <hi>Mark</hi> now with him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. And this Epistle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15.</p>
               <p>It is observable that these two great Apostles <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> the severall Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of the Circumcision and Uncircumcision, had their interchanged agents: <hi>Sylvanus</hi> or <hi>Silas, Pauls</hi> Minister, residen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Although we dare not punctually assert either the bearer of this Epistle, or the exact time of its writing, yet that it was written and sent about these times that we are upon, may be observed by these two boundaries that shut it up within some reasonable compasse of the time hereabout. First, <hi>A parte ante,</hi> or that it could not be written much sooner then this, may be concluded by this, that <hi>Timothy</hi> had gone through his imprisonment and was now inlarged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore its writing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.23. And secondly, <hi>A parte post,</hi> or that it could not be written much after this time, may be observed from that passage <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.4. <hi>Ye have not yet resisted unto blood.</hi> For presently after this bloody times came on.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:59067:80"/>That it was written by <hi>Paul,</hi> hath not only the concurrent consent of all Copies and Translations, but even this proof for it, That none can be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>A prisoner,</hi> Chap. 10.34. and <hi>in Italy,</hi> Chap. 13.24. and in so near con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse with <hi>Timothy,</hi> Chap. 13.25. [as the Authour of this Epistle was] so likely as <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His not affixing his name to this, as he had done to his other Epistles, doth no more deny it to be his, then the first Epistle of <hi>Iohns</hi> is denied to be <hi>Iohns</hi> upon the same account: especially considering that the name of the Apostle of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumcision, would not sound so well before an Epistle to the Circumcised: and yet the more still, because he sent it by <hi>Mark</hi> [for so we cannot but suppose] who was a Minister of the Minister of the Circumcision, and who could easily inform them of the Writer.</p>
               <p>Unto what part of the Jewish Nation he sendeth the Epistle under the indorse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>To the Hebrews,</hi> and why that indorsement <hi>To the Hebrews</hi> rather then <hi>To the Iews,</hi> may be a usefull and a needfull <hi>Quaere.</hi> It cannot be imagined but that he sendeth it to be delivered at a certain place within some reasonable compasse, because it was impossible for the bearer, whosoever he was, to deliver it to all the Jews dispersion, and because in <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.23. he saith that when <hi>Timothy</hi> came, he would come with him, and see them. Therefore the title <hi>The Hebrews</hi> must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the place, since there is nothing else to determine it. A double reason may be given why he so stileth them rather then <hi>Iews:</hi> namely, either because the name <hi>Iew</hi> was now beginning to become odious; or rather because he would point out the Jews that dwelt in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> or the Land of <hi>Israel.</hi> And this sense doth the holy Ghost put upon the title <hi>the Hebrews,</hi> Act. 6.1. where it is said, <hi>There was a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews:</hi> By <hi>The Hellenists</hi> meaning the Jews that dwelt in forreign Countries among the Greeks, and by <hi>The Hebrews</hi> those that dwelt in <hi>Iudea.</hi> And so it is most proper to understand the inscription of this Epistle, namely that <hi>Paul</hi> directs, and sends it to the beleeving Jews of <hi>Iudea:</hi> a people that had been much ingaged to him for his care of their poor, getting collections for them all along his travels, and <hi>Mark</hi> [whom we suppose the bearer of this Epistle] had come in to his attendance, and to the attendance of his Uncle <hi>Barnabas,</hi> when they had been in <hi>Iudea</hi> to bring almes unto those Churches, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. &amp; 12.</p>
               <p>It is not to be doubted indeed that he intendeth the discourse and matter of this Epistle to all the Jews throughout all their dispersion [and therefore <hi>Peter</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Jews of <hi>Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> applies it as written to them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15.] yet doth he indorse it, and send it chiefly to <hi>The Hebrews</hi> or the Jews of <hi>Iudaea,</hi> the principall seat of the Circumcision, as the properest center whither to direct it, and from whence it might best diffuse in time to the whole cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of their dispersion.</p>
               <p>He hath to deal in it mainly with those things that the Jewish writers commonly call <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Unto that doubtfulnesse that some have taken up about the Originall tongue of this Epistle, as thinking it very improper that he should write in the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> especially to the <hi>Hebrews in Iudaea,</hi> we need no better sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction then what the Hebrews themselves, yea the <hi>Hebrews of Iudaea</hi> may give to us, I mean the <hi>Ierusalem Gomarists,</hi> from severall-passages that they have about the Greek language.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Megillah, fol.</hi> 71. <hi>col.</hi> 2. they say thus, <hi>There is a tradition from ben Kaphra, God shall inlarge Iaphet, and he shall dwell in the tents of Sem: For they shall speak the language of Iaphet in the tents of Sem.</hi> The <hi>Babylon Gomara</hi> on the same Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise <hi>fol.</hi> 9. <hi>col.</hi> 2. resolves us, what tongue of <hi>Iaphet</hi> is meant; for having spoken all

               </p>
               <p>Our men first named, say further thus: <hi>Rabbi Ionathan of Beth Gubrin saith, There are four Languages brave for the world to use, and they are these: The Vulgar, the Roman, the Syrian, and the Hebrew, and some also add the Assyrian:</hi> Now the question is, What Tongue he means by <hi>the Vulgar?</hi> Reason will name the <hi>Greek</hi> as soon as any; and <hi>Midras Tillin,</hi> makes it plain that this is meant; for <hi>fol.</hi> 25. <hi>col.</hi> 4. speaking of this very passage [but alledging it in somewhat different termes] he nameth the <hi>Greek</hi> which is not here named. Observe then that the Hebrews call the Greek <hi>the Vulgar tongue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They proceed, <hi>ibid. col.</hi> 3. <hi>It is a tradition. Rabban Simeon ben Gamaliel saith, In books they permitted not, that they should write, but only in Greek. They searched, and found. that the Law cannot be interpreted compleatly but only in the Greek. One once expounded to them, in the Syriack, out of the Greek R. Ieremiah in the name of R. Chaiith ben Ba saith, Aquila the proselyte interpreted the Law, before R. Eliezer and before R. Ioshua. And they extolled him and said, Thou art fairer then the children of men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the same <hi>Talmud in Sotah fol.</hi> 21. <hi>col.</hi> 2. hath this record. <hi>Rabbi Levi went to Caesarea, and heard them <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> rehearsing their Phylacteries Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenisticè,</hi> or, in the <hi>Greek</hi> tongue. A passage very well worth observing: For if in <hi>Caesarea</hi> were as learned Schools as any were in the Nation; And if their Phyla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteries [pickt sentences out of the Law] might above all things have challenged their rehearsall in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue, as their own writers shew, yet they say them over in Greek, <hi>Paul</hi> might very well write to the Hebrews in <hi>Iudaea</hi> in the Greek tongue, when that tongue was in so common a use even in an University of <hi>Iudaea</hi> it self.</p>
               <p>To these testimonies for the Greek tongue, might be added, that which is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Treatise <hi>Shekalin, per.</hi> 3. <hi>halac.</hi> 2. <hi>Vpon the three Treasure Chests of the Temple were written Aleph, Beth, Gimel. But Rabbi Ismael saith, It was written upon them in Greek, Alpha, Beta, Gamma:</hi> They that hold that this Epistle, and the Gospel of <hi>Matthew</hi> were written in Hebrew, should consider how that tongue was now a stranger to all but Scholers, and how God in his providence had dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persed and planted the Greek tongue throughout all the world, by the conquest of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and the <hi>Grecian</hi> Monarchy; and had brought the old Testament into <hi>Greek</hi> by the <hi>Septuagint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As this Apostle in all his Epistles useth exceeding much of the Jews Dialect, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, Learning, allusion and reference to their opinions, traditions and customs; so doth he more singularly in this, and he doth moreover in a more peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner apply himself, to their manner of argumentation and discourse. For his intent is, if he can, to argue them into establishment, against that grievous Apostacy that was now afoot: so many revolting from the purity of the Gospel, either to a totall betaking themselves to <hi>Moses</hi> again, or at least mixing the Ceremonious rites of the Law with the profession of the Gospel. Comparing his style here, with his style of discourse and arguing in the <hi>Talmuds, Zohar</hi> and <hi>Rabboth,</hi> and such like older writings of the Jews, you might easily tell with whom he is dealing though the Epistle were not inscribed in syllables, <hi>To the Hebrews:</hi> and the very stile of it may argue a Scholer of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> but now better taught and better improving his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then that master could teach him,</p>

To which a Jew would be ready to answer, I but this is to be understood of God the Father; and how could this objection be answered? Yes, even by their own concessions, upon which he argueth in this place. For they understood that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. <hi>The Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters,</hi> of the Spirit of <hi>Christ,</hi> and so do they interpret it <gap reason="foreign">

And the Apostle doth set forth the horrid impiety of accounting the blood of the Covenant a common thing, by this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause even the Sonne of God himself was sanctified by it or set apart as Mediator: And so should I understand the words, He hath trodden under foot that Sonne of God, and counted the blood of the Covenant by which he the Sonne of God was sanctified, an unholy thing. He magnifieth faith, against those works that they stood upon and sought to be justified by, and sheweth that this was the all in all with all the holy men both before the Law and under it. When he gives them cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Lest there be any fornicatour or profane person as Esau,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.16. he doth not only speak according to the common tenet of the Nation, that <hi>Esau</hi> was a fornicator, as see <hi>Targ. Ierus. in Gen.</hi> 25. but he seemeth to have his eye upon the <hi>Nicolaitan</hi> doctrine that was now rife, that taught fornication: to which he seemeth also to refer, in those words, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.4. <hi>Marriage is honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And now henceforward you have no more story of this Apostle: what became of him after the writing of this Epistle it is impossible to finde out, by any light that the Scripture holdeth out in this matter. The two last verses but one of this Epistle, trace him as far forward as we can any way else see him, and that is but a little way neither. <hi>Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty, with whom if he come shortly I will see you.</hi> By which words these things may be conjectured. 1. That after his inlargement out of bonds, he left <hi>Rome,</hi> and preached in <hi>Italy.</hi> He men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioneth in his Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> his desire and intent to go preach in <hi>Spain, Rom,</hi> 15.24. but that was so long ago, that he had now found some just cause [so much time intervening] to steer his course another way. For 2. It appears that when he wrote this Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> he intended very shortly to set for <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea,</hi> if so be he sent the Epistle to the Jews of <hi>Iudaea</hi> as hath been shewed most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable he did.

to go to <hi>Philippi,</hi> Phil. 2.23, 24. Nay yet further, to <hi>Colosse,</hi> Philem. ver. 22. Nay yet further into <hi>Iudaea.</hi> It is like that the Apostacy and wavering that he heard of in the Eastern Churches, shewed him more need to hasten thither then to go westward. 3. He waited a little to see whether <hi>Timothy</hi> now inlarged would come to him in that place of <hi>Italy</hi> where he now was: which if he did, he intended to bring him along with him: but whether they met and travelled together, or what further became of either of them, we shall not go about to trace, lest seeking after them we lose our selves.</p>

               </head>
               <p> Although therefore, the certain time of his writing this Epistle cannot be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, yet since he died in the year that we are upon, we may, not unproperly, look upon it as written not very long before his death. And that the rather, because by an expression or two he intimates the vengeance of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> drawing very near. Chap. 5.8, 9. <hi>The coming of the Lord draweth nigh</hi>; and, <hi>Behold the Iudge standeth before the door.</hi> He being the Apostle residentiary of the Circumcision in <hi>Iudea,</hi> could not but of all others be chiefly in the eyes of those that maliced the Gospel there, and the Ministers of it: So it could not but be in his eye, to observe those tokens growing on apace that his Master had spoken of, as the forerunners and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warders of that destruction coming: False Prophets, Iniquity abounding, Love waxing cold, betraying and undoing one another, that he could not but very sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude, that the Judge and judgement was not far from the door.</p>
               <p>Among other things that our Saviour foretelleth should precede that destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, this was one. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.14. <hi>This Gospel of the Kingdom shall be preached in all the world, for a witnesse unto all Nations, and then shall the end come.</hi> And so did the Gospel reach all the twelve Tribes, as well as other Nations, even the ten Tribes, as well as the other two. Therefore <hi>Iames</hi> a Minister of the Circumcision, doth properly direct this Epistle <hi>to all the twelve Tribes scattered abroad.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The whole Nation was at this time, some at the very height of unbelief and crossenesse against the Gospel, and others at the very depth of suffering for it: therefore he comforts the one, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. and denounceth their just doom against the other, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4, and 5. He striveth to beat down four things especially, which
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:59067:82"/>
were not only unbecoming the <hi>Christian</hi> profession, but even enemies against it. The first was, estimating men according to their gorgeous outside, and so the poor preachers and professors of the Gospel were contemned. Secondly, Their having many masters or teachers, whereby errours and schismes were easily scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered and planted among them, and much mischief done by unbridled tongues. Thirdly, Their reliance upon their historicall faith, they thinking that enough, and neglecting to bring forth the fruits of a faith saving and lively. And lastly, Their common and vain oaths, to which the Jewish nation, and that by the lenity, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration of their own Canons, was exceeding loose.</p>
               <p>In the close of the Epistle, he speaketh of <hi>the Elders anointing the sick with oyl, Chap.</hi> 5.14. which may receive some explication from these things observed in their own writings.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That anointing with oyl was an ordinary medicinall application to the sick. Talm. Jerus. in Baracoth. fol. 3. col. 1. <hi>R. Simeon the sonne of Eleazar permitted R. Meir to mingle wine and oyl, and to anoint the sick on the Sabbath. And he was once sick, and we sought to do so to him, but he suffered us not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Id. in Maasar Sheni. fol. 53. col. 3. <hi>A tradition. Anointing on the Sabbath is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. If his headake, or if a scall come upon it, he anoints with oyl.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Talm. Bab. in Joma fol. 77.2. <hi>If he be sick, or scall be upon his head, he anoints ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his manner,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now if we take the Apostles counsell as referring to this medicinall practice, we may construe it, that he would have this Physicall administration to be improved to the best advantage, namely that whereas <hi>Anointing with oyl</hi> was ordinarily used to the sick, by way of Physick, he adviseth that they should send for the Elders of the Church to do it; not that the anointing was any more in their hand then in anothers, as to the thing it self, for it was still but a Physicall application, but that they with the applying of this corporall Physick, might also pray with and for the patient, and apply the spirituall Physick of good admonition and comforts to him. Which is much the same, as if in our Nation, where this physicall anointing is not so in use, a sick person should send for the Minister at taking of any Physick, that he might pray with him and counsell and comfort him: Or</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was very common among the Jews to use charming and anointing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, of persons that were sick of certain maladies: of this the <hi>Ierus. Talm.</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in Schab. fol. 14. col. 3. <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>A man that one charmeth, he putteth oyl upon his head and charmeth.</hi> And a little after, is related what they charmed for, as <hi>for an evil eye, serpents, scorpions,</hi> &amp;c. And in col. 4. is mentioned how <hi>one charmed over a sick person in the name of Iesu Pandira.</hi> Now this being a common wretched custom to anoint some that were sick and to use charming with the anointing, this Apostle [seeing anointing was an ordinary and good Physick, and the good use of it not to be extinguisht for that abuse] directs them better, namely to get the Elders or Ministers of the Church to come to the sick, and to adde to the medicinall anointing of him, their godly and fervent prayers for him, far more available and comfortable then all charming and inchanting, as well a far more warrantable and Christian.</p>

THis year [<hi>C. Lecanius</hi> and <hi>M. Licinius</hi> being Consuls] befell that sore fire in <hi>Rome,</hi> [of which some touch was given before] the forest that ever had befallen the City, and which made such desolation, <hi>That whereas the City was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into fourteen great Wards</hi> [they are the words of <hi>Tacitus] only four of the fourteen stood sound: For three were clean burnt down to the ground: and as for the other seven they were all tattered and half consumed, and but a few reliques of houses remained.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was commonly thought and talked, that <hi>Nero</hi> himself had the chief hand in
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:59067:83"/>
kindling and carrying on of this mischief; instigated thereunto either by his own inhumane and barbarous temper, which delighted in nothing more, then in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying; or by a tickling humour he had, to build the City anew, that it might bear his name. He to stop the mouth of the clamour, and to salve his credit, brought the <hi>Christians</hi> that were in the City, to examination and execution, as if they had been the only, and the all, in the breeding of this mishap. <hi>Igitur primò correpti qui fatebantur, deinde indicio eorum, haut perinde in crimine incendii, quam odio humani generis, convicti sunt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Therefore they were first laid hold on, that confessed themselves Christians: and then by their discovery a vast multitude was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed, not so much for reall guilt of kindling that fire, as because of the generall hate of men against them. And moreover there were scorns added to their deaths, for they were cast, wrapped in beasts skins to be devoured of dogs, or they were crucified, or burnt, and served for lights by night, when the day was gone. Whereupon they were pitied, seeing that they were thus destroyed, not for the publick benefit, but only for one mans cruelty.</hi> Thus <hi>Tacitus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What havock may we think this dolefull persecution made? as among other Christians at <hi>Rome,</hi> so particularly among those eminent ones, that <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epistle thither, saluteth by name, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. of whom many, no doubt, were alive till now, and now dispatched. He himself, and <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> with other of his retinue, may well be supposed to have been got away before this storm came, because in severall places of his Epistles written a good while ago, as we have observed, he speaketh of his setting away with what speed possible and convenient. How escaped <hi>Peter</hi> if he now sate Bishop at <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Rome</hi> asserteth?</p>
               <p>Whether this persecution were circumscribed within the bounds of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Italy,</hi> or whether it was carried by the command of the tyrant through all other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries [as <hi>Vid.</hi> Euseb. <hi>Eccles. Hist. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 24. Oros. <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] we need not to be much solicitous to go about to decide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> certainly, though it were not inforced by any Edict or command, yet such a copy would be taken for a warrant, especially by those that without either command or copy, had been forward enough to do mischief to the professors of the Gospel already, and had taken, nay had made any occasion to undo, or destroy them. The Jews at this mastery were the busiest men of any, and that <hi>mystery of iniquity</hi> was ever working, but could not strike their full stroke, because something hindred, 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.6, 7. If he that hindred were <hi>Claudius,</hi> who by his expulsion of the Jews out of <hi>Rome,</hi> shewed a frown upon the whole Nation, and suffered them not to rage as they would have done, he was taken away about ten years ago; and they felt their chain much slackned at the coming in of <hi>Nero:</hi> who in his best years, though he broke not out to destroy all before him, as he did afterward, yet was he destructive enough to Christianity, as we have observed, and loose and carelesse of the administration of affairs, and regarded not how things went, so that he might have his ease, luxury and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, which his Tutors <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Burrhus</hi> made but unworthy advantage of. But now that he himself hath given so visible, bloody and cursed an example, the Jews that stood barking at their chain-end all this while, finding themselves so far let loose as such an example might loose them, which was too farre, would fall on without mercy. They had been mischievous enough alwaies against the profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors of the Gospel, but from hence forward they exceeded, and the more they grew toward their desolation, the more did the devil make them bestirre themselves, knowing the shortnesse of his time there.</p>
               <p>This tenth of <hi>Nero</hi> there was a blazing starre, horrid lightnings and thunders, and divers monstrous births.</p>

THis year [the eleventh of <hi>Nero, Silius Nerva</hi> and <hi>Atticus Vestinus,</hi> being Consuls] very many eminent and gallant men of <hi>Rome</hi> were cut off by the Tyrant, as the last year he had cut off many eminent and worthy Christians. The Christians he destroyed, by a plot laid against them by himself; the <hi>Romans</hi> for a plot laid by them against him. The names of those that perished, now best known among us, were <hi>Seneca the Philosopher, Nero</hi>'s Tutor, and his nephew <hi>the Poet Lucan.</hi> Both of them very renowned for their Writings, but both of them very ignominious for a severall miscarriage. <hi>Seneca</hi> for unparalleled covetousnesse, usury and oppression mentioned before: and <hi>Lucan</hi> for betraying his own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Let him bear <hi>Tacitus</hi> his brand: <hi>Lucanus, Quinctianus, &amp; Senecio diu ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuere. Post, promissa impunitate corrupti, quo tarditatem excusarent, Lucanus Atil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam matrem suam,</hi> [observe that] <hi>Quinctianus Glicium Gallum, Senecio Annium Pollionem amicorum praecipuos nominavere. Lucan, Quinctianus &amp; Senecio, were long before they would confesse any thing: But at last, being corrupted by the promise of impunity, that they might make amends for their slownesse, Lucan accused his mother Atilla,</hi> &amp;c. Hereupon <hi>Atilla</hi> was wracked one day; and would confesse no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: and the next day being carried to the wrack again [for she was so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joynted that she could not go] she made a shift as she sate in the cart to strangle her self: choosing so to dye rather then either to endure the wrack again, or to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach any. An indeleble blot to her son <hi>Lucan</hi> for ever. Nor did his base shift serve his turn, for he suffered death too, by having his veins cut and so bleeding to death; which was the end of his Uncle <hi>Seneca</hi> also.</p>
               <p>The Warres of the Jews are now drawing on apace [for they began the next year] and the horrid Civil Warres of the <hi>Romans</hi> are not farre off. So that here we may properly take notice of that prediction ready now to take place. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.7, 8, 9. <hi>Nation shall rise against Nation, and Kingdom against Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>All these are the beginnings of sorrows.

               <p>A fitter period of time whence to begin the punctuall taking place of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, we can hardly point out, then this very year that we are upon, a center between two criticall years: the year before beginning the persecution of Christians at <hi>Rome,</hi> and the year following beginning the Warres of the Jews in <hi>Iudaea.</hi>

               <p>He magnifieth <hi>Baptism</hi> as a badge and pledge of preservation of those that had received it, and stuck to it, from that vengeance that was coming upon that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Nation, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.21. It is something a strange recoyling that he makes, leaping back from mention of the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> ver. 18. over all the story of the Old Testament, and lighteth on the generation that was swept away by the flood: and sheweth how <hi>Christs</hi> spirit preached unto them. Why? had not the same spirit preached in all the times between? Why are not those times named then as well as these? Because the Apostle doth purposely intend to compare that old world then destroyed, with the destruction of the Jewish Nation shortly coming: and to shew that as <hi>Noah</hi> and his family were then saved by water, <hi>ver.</hi> 20. so, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they that had received Baptism were the Antitype to that, and Baptism was a pledge and means of their deliverance <hi>now,</hi> they sticking closely to it. And this very thing <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> taught in that question, <hi>Who hath forewarned you to flee from the wrath to come?</hi> Therefore when he cals <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. <hi>An asking of a good Conscience towards or after God,</hi> he makes not this its definition, as if none but those so qualified were to be baptized, but he characters its difference from Circumcision, which put away the filth of the flesh in one sense; and Legall and Pharisaicall washings, which did it in another. His whole comparison runnes to this tenour: The old world was disobedient to the spirit of <hi>Christ</hi> preaching in the mouth of <hi>Noah,</hi> and therefore they perished. The Jews [whose state the Scripture also calleth <hi>an old world</hi>] were disobedient to <hi>Christ</hi> preaching by his
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:59067:84"/>
Spirit in the mouth of his Apostles, and even visibly and audibly in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, therefore they must needs perish: But <hi>Noah</hi> and his family that hearkeneth after God [whilest others said to the Lord <hi>Depart from us,</hi> Job 22.16, 17.] were preserved by water: Even <hi>so doth Baptism now preserve us, the Antitype of that figure.</hi> For Baptism was not barely a washing of the body from filth, as the common Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall washings were, but it was an owning and asking after God, conscienciously, out from a perverse and wicked generation: and therefore not to be started or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from. This then being one end of Baptism, and that end taught to them that assumed it, <hi>viz.</hi> to badge and mark to safety from the approaching vengeance, it may very well raise an argument for Infants Baptism [whereas this text is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly produced against it:] for if these parents that came in to be baptized, sought hereby to <hi>flee from the wrath to come,</hi> they would be carefull to bring their children under the same badge of security.</p>
               <p>When he judgeth those that perished in the waters of <hi>Noah</hi> to be now <hi>in prison, ver.</hi> 19. he knew he had the consent of his Nation in it: for thus they say in <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedr.</hi> per. 10. halac. 3. <hi>The generation of the flood have no portion in the world to come: neither shall they stand up in Iudgement; for it is said, My spirit shall no more judge with man,</hi> Gen. 6.3. <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth us that the Spirit that strove with the old world, was the Spirit of <hi>Messias.</hi>

In regard that the appearance of the <hi>Messias</hi> was expected to be about the time that <hi>Christ</hi> appeared indeed, very many taking advantage of the time and of that expectation, took upon them, some to be <hi>Christ,</hi> others to be Prophets attending, and relating to his coming, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. Upon which <hi>Iosephus</hi> and other Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of that Nation will give us a very full commentary of experiences. 2. There were multitudes of the <hi>Zelotae,</hi> and of the sect of <hi>Iudas the Galilean,</hi> which would not yield any homage or subjection to be due to the <hi>Roman</hi> power which was now over them: and neither would they now themselves, nor would they suffer others,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:59067:85"/>
as farre as they could hinder, to submit unto them. 3. The unbeleeving Jews were generally sworn enemies and persecutors of those that beleeved. And 4. which we have observed before, multitudes of those that had beleeved and imbraced the Gospel fell away, and became either seduced or the greatest sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and brought in horrid heresies and pollutions. So that in these various and malignant distempers of men, there had been continuall confusions, tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, firings, murderings and plunderings among them for many years, and they had been the unquietest and most tumultuous Nation that had been under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and they had often provoked the <hi>Roman</hi> power against themselves, yet till this year had they never so visibly and professedly taken up Arms and open Warre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst that power.</p>
               <p>The first spark kindled in <hi>Caesarea</hi> upon the sea, about an incroachment that a Gentile there made upon the way that went to the Jews Synagogue; and from thence it grew into a flame so fast through the whole Country [<hi>Florus</hi> the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour helping it on] that by the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> day of <hi>May,</hi> his souldiers by his Commission have plundered <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> slain 3600 persons: and even <hi>Berenice</hi> sister to King <hi>Agrippa</hi> escaped very narrowly with her life.</p>
               <p>The Jews and Romans have divers skirmishes: <hi>Massada</hi> Castle taken and the <hi>Roman</hi> Garrison put to the sword. The Temple and severall parts of the Cities made Garrisons for severall parties, and suffer much by fire and battery. Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thousand Jews slain in <hi>Caesarea</hi> on a Sabbath: whereupon all the Nation rise all about to avenge this slaughter, and in <hi>Syria, Phaenicia, Samaria, Peraea</hi> and all round about, destroy Towns, Cities and persons all before them. <hi>Cestius</hi> the Governour of <hi>Syria</hi> rises with his forces, and destroys the Jews again, and their Towns all before him, and on the 30<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>October</hi> enters <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and fires a good part of the City.</p>
               <p>Yet do the Jews give him a brush upon his march away, and cut off above 4000 of his men: with which successe they are so fleshed, that they resolve to fight it out, and accordingly platform themselves into the modell and posture of a long Warre: and the Country is only full of Fire, Sword, Warre and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The abomination of desolation</hi> had now begun to stand in the holy place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.15. when the Temple is made a Garrison, and filled with slaughter; <hi>Antonia,</hi> the Castle of the Temple, besieged, taken, and the <hi>Roman</hi> Garrison put to the sword.

He therefore in <hi>Babylon,</hi>

understanding how affairs went in <hi>Iudaea</hi> and with the Jewish Nation all thereabout, and reading therein, from the words of his Master, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. that the desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was drawing on apace, concludes that his time was not long: and therefore improves the time he hath remaining the best he can, not only in teaching those amongst whom he was, but by writing this Epistle instructeth those that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and at distance from him; in which he doth more especially give them cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against false teachers: and characters the terrour of the judgement coming, and exhorts to vigilancy and holinesse.</p>
               <p>The first character that he gives of the false teachers is, that <hi>they bring in dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Heresies, denying the Lord that bought them,</hi> Chap. 2.1. which he speaketh from <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. from whence also he useth other expressions, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>Is not he thy Father that hath bought thee?</hi> not meaning that these wretches were redeemed by <hi>Christ,</hi> yet became such wretches, as some would interpret it; but by <hi>buying</hi> is meant his buying out of <hi>Egypt</hi> this people for a peculiar people: which these wretches boasted and stood upon, yet by their introducing and practising the prophane principles they did, of fornication and communicating with Idols, they denied the true God which bought that people for his peculiar. He cals them <hi>spots, ver.</hi> 13. from <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.5. and parallels them with the old world, <hi>Sodom, Balaam,</hi> nay the very fallen Angels.</p>
               <p>He sets forth the destruction of that cursed Nation and their City in those terms that <hi>Christ</hi> had done, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. and that the Scripture doth elsewhere, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.22, 23, 24. <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.23. namely as the destruction of the whole world, <hi>The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens passing away, the elements melting, and the earth burnt up,</hi> &amp;c. And according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he speaks of <hi>a new heaven and a new earth,</hi> from <hi>Isa.</hi> 65.17. a new state of the Church under the Gospel among the Gentiles, when this old world of the Jews state should be dissolved.</p>
               <p>He citeth <hi>Pauls Epistle to the Hebrews,</hi> and giveth an honourable testimony to that, and to the rest of his Epistles: but acknowledgeth that in some places they are hard to be understood, and were misconstrued by some unlearned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable ones to their own ruine; yet neither doth he, nor <hi>Paul</hi> who was yet alive, and well knew of this wresting of his Epistles, clear or amend those difficulties, but let them alone as they were: for the holy Ghost hath so penned Scripture as to set men to study.</p>
               <p>And here is the last that we hear in Scripture of this great Apostle <hi>Peter.</hi> His Martyrdom he apprehends to be near, and it was to be before <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, which was not now full four years to come. We may well conceive him to have been put to death by the Jews in <hi>Babylonia</hi> where he now was: a madnesse having come upon that Nation in all parts: and a singular raging a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Gospel, the devil bestirring himself in them, now he knew their time was so short.</p>

               <p>As the second Epistle of <hi>Peter</hi> and this of <hi>Iude</hi> are very near akin, in style, matter and subject, so it is fairly conjecturable in them that they were not farre removed in time, speaking both of wicked ones and wickednesse at the same height and ripenesse. They are one to another as the Prophesie of <hi>Obadiah,</hi> and <hi>Ierem.</hi> 49.14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> speaking the same thing, using the same manner of arguing, and oftentimes almost the same words.

               <p>In citing the story of <hi>Michael the Archangel contending with the devil about the body of Moses,</hi> ver. 9. he doth but the same that <hi>Paul</hi> doth in naming <hi>Iannes and Iambres,</hi> namely alledge a story which was current and owned among the Nation, though there were no such thing in Scripture; and so he argueth with them from their own Authors and concessions. It is harsh to strain <hi>Zech.</hi> 3.1, 2. to speak
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:59067:86"/>
such a story; when neither the name <hi>Michael</hi> is mentioned, nor any thing like the body of <hi>Moses</hi> or akin to it.

               <p>His alledging the Prophesie of <hi>Enoch,</hi> is an arguing of the very like nature, as citing and referring to some known and common tradition that they had among them to this purpose. [The Book <hi>Sepher Iesher</hi> an Hebrew Writer speaketh of <hi>Enoch</hi> after such a tenour.] And in both these he useth their own testimonies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst themselves: as if he should thus have spoken at large: <hi>These men speak evil of dignities,</hi> whereas they have and own a story for current, that even <hi>Michael the Archangel</hi> did not speak evil of the devil, when he was striving with him about the body of <hi>Moses,</hi> &amp;c. And whereas they shew and own a Prophesie of <hi>Enoch,</hi> of God coming in judgement, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> why these are the very men to whom such a matter is to be applied, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is no strange thing in the New Testament, for <hi>Christ</hi> and the Apostles to deal and argue with the Jews upon their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions.</p>

               <p>Among all the Apostolick Epistles there is none about whose time of writing we are so farre to seek as we are about these. And it is neither satisfactory to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move their place, nor is it satisfactory to take their time according to their place; or to conceive them to be written after the Epistles of <hi>Peter,</hi> because they are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced after them. Any conjecture that is to be had of them may best be taken from the third Epistle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gaius,</hi> to whom that Epistle is directed, by that encomiastick character that <hi>Iohn</hi> giveth of him, seemeth to be <hi>Gaius the Corinthian, the host of the whole Church, Rom.</hi> 16.23. for since he is commended for entertainment and charity both to the Church and strangers, particularly to those who had preached among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, taking nothing of them, we know not where to finde any other <hi>Gaius</hi> to whom to affix this character but only this, and we have no reason to look after any other. And upon this probability we may observe these other.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That that third Epistle was written when those that preached to the Gentiles and took nothing of them, were still abroad upon that imployment, for he ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth him to bring them forward on their journey, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. Now under that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression, of <hi>taking nothing of the Gentiles,</hi> we can understand none but <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and those that were of their severall companies, for the Scripture hath named none other. And if it referre to <hi>Paul</hi> and his company [for we finde not that <hi>Barnabas</hi> had any thing to do with <hi>Gaius</hi>] then we must conclude that it was written a good while before this time that we are upon: unlesse we will suppose <hi>Paul</hi> after his freedom from imprisonment at <hi>Rome,</hi> was got travelling and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in those parts again. But I should rather suppose that <hi>Iohn</hi> sent this third Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to <hi>Gaius</hi> to <hi>Corinth,</hi> by <hi>Timothy</hi> from <hi>Ephesus,</hi> who was setting away thence for <hi>Rome,</hi> upon <hi>Pauls</hi> sending for him to come to him thither, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.9, 11, 21. In which journey as we have shewed before, he was to call at <hi>Corinth,</hi> and to take <hi>Mark</hi> along with him, who was there. And of them may <hi>Iohns</hi> advice to <hi>Gaius</hi> be well understood, <hi>Whom if thou bring forward on their journey thou shalt do well: For for his sake they went out taking nothing of the Gentiles; Mark</hi> with <hi>Barnabas,</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> with <hi>Paul.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. Before <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote this Epistle to <hi>Gaius,</hi> he had written another Epistle, to some Church, it may be that of <hi>Corinth,</hi> of which <hi>Gaius</hi> was. <hi>I wrote,</hi> saith he, <hi>unto the Church, but Diotrephes who loveth to have the preminence, receiveth us not.</hi> This must needs be understood of <hi>The first Epistle of Iohn:</hi> unlesse we will conceive, <hi>unwarrantably</hi> [that I may say no worse,] that any of <hi>Iohns</hi> Writings are lost.</p>

               <head>THE REVELATION OF JOHN.</head>
               <p>AS it will be easily admitted to place this Book last of all the New Testament, because it stands so in all Bibles, so on the other hand it will be cavilled at, that I have brought in the writing of it so soon, as before the fall of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> since it hath been of old and commonly held, that it was penned in the reign of <hi>Domitian,</hi> farre after these times that we are upon: But the reasons by which I have been induced thereunto, will appear out of some passages in the Book it self as we go through it.</p>
               <p>As God revealed to <hi>Daniel the man greatly beloved,</hi> the state of his people, and the Monarchies that afflicted them, from his own time, till the coming of <hi>Christ</hi>; so doth <hi>Christ</hi> to <hi>Iohn the beloved Disciple,</hi> the state of the Church, and story in brief of her chief afflicters, from thence to the end of the world. So that <hi>where Daniel ends the Revelation begins,</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> hath nothing to do with any of the four Monarchies that he speaketh of, but deals with a fifth [the <hi>Roman</hi>] that rose as it were out of the ashes of those four, and swallowed them all up.</p>
               <p>The composure of the Book is much like <hi>Daniels</hi> in this, that it repeats one story over and over again, in varied and inlarged expressions: and exceeding like <hi>Ezekiel's</hi> in method and things spoken. The style is very Propheticall, as to the
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:59067:87"/>
things spoken; and very Hebraizing, as to the speaking of them. Exceeding much of the old Prophets language and matter adduced to intimate new stories<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and exceeding much of the Jews language, and allusion to their customs and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, thereby to speak the things more familiarly to be understood. And as <hi>Ezekiel</hi> wrote concerning the ruine of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> when the ruining of it was now begun, so I suppose doth <hi>Iohn</hi> of the finall destruction of it, when the Warres and miseries were now begun, which bred its destruction.</p>

And here is one reason that induceth me to suppose this Book written, before that City was destroyed.</p>
                  <p>Coming to reade the present condition of these <hi>Asian</hi> Churches in the Epistles written to them, we may pertinently think of that saying of <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.15. <hi>This thou knowest that all they that are in Asia are turned from me:</hi> A great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacy: of which there is too much evidence in these Churches, as also mention of some sad fruits of it, and means and instruments inducing to it. As 1. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleeving Jews which the holy Ghost all along cals <hi>A Synagogue of Satan:</hi> with these the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> was pestered, and more especially <hi>Pergamus,</hi> where their mischievousnesse is stiled the very throne or <hi>seat of Satan:</hi> and where they had murdered <hi>Antipas</hi> a faithfull Martyr already. 2.

                  <p>The scene of <hi>Iohns</hi> visions said to be <hi>in heaven,</hi> is according to the scheme of <hi>the Temple</hi> and the Divine glory there. And hence you have mention of the Altar, Candlesticks, Sea of glasse [the brazen laver made of the womens looking glasses] the Ark of the Covenant, and the like. And as at the opening of the Temple doors, a Trumpet sounded, so is the allusion here. The door in Heaven opened, and a Trumpet cals <hi>Iohn</hi> to come in and see what there. <hi>And immediatly he was in the Spirit,</hi> ver. 2. Why? was he not in the Spirit before? <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.10. and was he not in the Spirit, in seeing the door in heaven opened? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve a double degree in rapture: as inspired men may be considered under a double notion: <hi>viz.</hi> Those that were inspired with Prophesie or to be Prophets and to preach, and those that were inspired to be Penmen of Divine Writ, which was higher. <hi>Iohn</hi> hath both inspirations or revelations to both ends, both in the Vision before, and this: then he was in the Spirit and saw the vision, and was in the Spirit and inspired to pen what he saw, and what to be sent to the Churches. And in the first verse of this Chapter he is in the Spirit or hath a revelation, and in <hi>ver.</hi> 2. he is in the Spirit, he is inspired so as to take impression and remembrance of these things to write them also.</p>
                  <p>He seeth <hi>Christ</hi> inthroned in the middle of his Church, in the same Prophetick and visionary Embleme that <hi>Ezekiel</hi> had seen, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. &amp; 10. and this is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary and fulfilling of that scene that <hi>Daniel</hi> speaketh of, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.9, 10, 22. In <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> the Lord, when <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was now to be destroyed, and the glory of the Lord that used to be there, and the people were to flit into another Land, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth so inthroned, as sitting in Judgement and flitting away by degrees to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place: as compare <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. &amp; 10. well together. So <hi>Christ</hi> here; when the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was now near at hand, and his glory and presence to remove from that Nation, now given up to unbelief and obduration, to reside among the Gentiles, he is seated upon his throne as Judge and King with glorious attendance, to judge that Nation for their sinnes and unbelief, and stating the affairs of his Church whither his glory was now removing.</p>
                  <p>The scheme is platformed according to the modell of <hi>Israels</hi> Camp. 1. The Tabernacle was in the middle there, so is the throne here. 2. There the four squadrons of the Camp of <hi>Levi</hi> next the Tabernacle, so here the four living creatures. 3. Then the whole Camp of <hi>Israel,</hi> so here twenty four Elders Representatives of the whole Church, built from twelve Tribes and twelve Apostles.</p>
                  <p>In the hand of him that sate on the Throne was a Book sealed which no creature could open. This justly cals us back to <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>where words are shut up and a Book sealed unto the time of the end:</hi> and now that that is near drawing on, the Book is here opened.</p>

                  <p>THe opening of the six Seals in this Chapter, speaks the ruine and rejection of the Jewish Nation, and the desolation of their City; which is now very near at hand.</p>
                  <p>The first Seal opened <hi>ver.</hi> 2. shews <hi>Christ</hi> setting forth in Battell array and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengement against them, as <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.4, 5. And this the New Testament speaketh very much and very highly of, one while calling it <hi>his coming in clouds,</hi> another while his <hi>coming in his Kingdome,</hi> and sometime his <hi>coming in Power and great Glory,</hi> and the like. Because his plagueing and destroying of the Nation that cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him, and that so much opposed and wrought mischief against the Gospel, was the first evidence that he gave in sight of all the world of his being <hi>Christ:</hi> for till then, he and his Gospel had been in humility, as I may say, as to the eyes of men, he persecuted whilest he was on earth, and they persecuted after him, and no course taken with them that so used both, but now he awakes, shews himself, and makes himself known by the Judgement that he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth.</p>
                  <p>The three next Seals opening, shew the means by which he did destroy, namely those three sad plagues that had been threatned so oft and so sore by the Prophets, <hi>Sword, Famine and Pestilence.</hi> For</p>
                  <p>The second Seal opened sends out one upon a red Horse to take Peace from the earth, and that men should destroy one another; he carried <hi>a great Sword, ver.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p>The third Seals opening speaks of Famine, when Corn for scarcity should be weighed like spicery in a pair of ballances, <hi>ver.</hi> 5, 6.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Seal sends out one on a pale Horse whose name was <hi>Death</hi> [the Chaldee very often expresseth the <hi>Plague</hi> or <hi>Pestilence</hi> by that word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The opening of the fifth Seal reveals a main cause of the vengeance, namely the blood of the Saints which had been shed, crying, and which was to be requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of that generation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.35, 36. These souls are said to cry from under the Altar, either in allusion to the blood of creatures sacrificed, poured at the foot of the Altar, or according to the Jews tenet, that <hi>all just soules depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted are under the Throne of Glory.</hi> Answer to their cry is given, that the number of their Brethren that were to be slain was not yet fulfilled, and they must rest till that should be, and then avengement in their behalf should come. This speakes sutable to that which we observed lately, that now times were begun of bitter persecution, an hour of temptation, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10. &amp; 3.10. the Jews and devil raging, till the Lord should something cool that fury by the ruine of that people.</p>
                  <p>The opening of the sixth Seal, <hi>ver.</hi> 12, 13. shews the destruction it self in those borrowed termes that the Scripture useth to expresse it by, namely as if it were the destruction of the whole world: as <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.29, 30. The sunne darkened, the starres falling, the heaven departing and the earth dissolved: and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion <hi>ver.</hi> 16. <hi>They shall say to the rocks fall on us,</hi> &amp;c. doth not only warrant, but even inforce us to understand and construe these things in the sense that we do: for Christ applies these very words to the very same thing, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.30. And here is another, and, to me, a very satisfactory reason, why to place the shewing of these visions to <hi>Iohn,</hi> and his wring of this Book before the desolation of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>

                  <p>THe opening of the seventh Seal lands us upon a new scene: as a new world began when <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was destroyed and the Jews cast off. The six Seals in the two former Chapters, have shewed their ruine, and the appearing of the Church of the Gentiles, and now the seven Trumpets under the seventh Seal give us a prospect in generall of the times thence forward to the end of all things. I say <hi>in generall,</hi> for from the beginning of the twelfth Chapter and forward to the end of the nineteenth they are handled more particularly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Silence in heaven for a while,</hi> and seven Angels with seven Trumpets may call our thoughts to <hi>Ioshua</hi> 6.4, 10. and intimate that the Prophetick story is now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred upon a new <hi>Canaan,</hi> or a new stage of the Church, as that businesse at <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>richo</hi> was at <hi>Israels</hi> first entring on the old: Or it may very properly be looked upon as referring and alluding to the carriage of things at the Temple, since this Book doth represent things so much according to the scheme and scene of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple all along.</p>
                  <p>And in this very place there is mention of the Altar and Incense and Trumpets, which were all Temple appurtenances. It was therefore the custom at the Temple that when the Priest went in to the Holy place, the people drew downward from the Porch of the Temple, and there was<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a silence whilest he was there, [yea though the people were then praying] incomparably beyond what there was at other times of the service, for the Priests were blowing with Trumpets or the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites singing: The allusion then here is plain. When the sacrifice was laid on the Altar, a Priest took coals from the Altar, went in to the Holy place, and offered incense upon the Golden Altar that stood before vail, that was before the Ark, and this being done, the Trumpets sounded over the sacrifice. Here then is first intimation of <hi>Christs</hi> being offered upon the Altar; then his going into the Holy place as Mediatour for his people: and then the Trumpets sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and declaring his disposals in the world. His taking fire off the Altar and casting it upon the earth, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. is a thing not used at the Temple, but spoken from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 10.2. which betokeneth the sending of judgement, which the Trumpets speak out.</p>
                  <p>These seven Trumpets, and the seven Vials in <hi>Chap.</hi> 16. in many things runne very parallel, how farre they Synchronize, will be best considered when we come there.</p>
                  <p>The first Trumpet sounding, brings hail and fire and blood upon the earth, and destroys grasse and trees a third part of them. <hi>Fire and hail was the plague of Egypt,</hi> Exod. 9.23. but <hi>fire and blood,</hi> with hail, is a new plague. By these seemeth to be intimated what plagues should be brought upon the world, by fire, sword, dreadfull tempest, unnaturall seasons and the like.</p>
                  <p>The second Trumpet sounds, and a great burning mountain is cast into the sea, and the third part of it becomes blood. <hi>The sea</hi> in the Prophetick lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, doth signifie multitudes of people: as <hi>Ierem.</hi> 51.36.42. And <hi>Babylon</hi> that was Monarch was <hi>a burning mountain</hi> in the same Chapter, <hi>ver.</hi> 35. So that the Imperiall power seemeth to be the mountain here; which made bloody and mischievous work, not only by the persecution of <hi>Christians,</hi> but even among their own people. As <hi>Nero</hi> at present, <hi>Vitellius</hi> instantly after, <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, Commodus,</hi> and indeed generally all of them either bloodily destroy their
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:59067:89"/>
own people, or at least for their covetousnesse, ambition, revenge or humour, bring disquietnesse, oppression, misery, Warres and blood, upon all the world, in one place or other.</p>
                  <p>The third Trumpet, brings the starre <hi>Wormwood</hi> upon the rivers and fountains of waters: which seemeth to denote the grievous Heresies that should be in the Church, which should corrupt and imbitter the pure springs of the Scripture and fountains of Truth. <hi>A starre</hi> in the language of this Book is a Church-man, <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.20. [<hi>Ben Cochab</hi> was such a <hi>Wormwood starre</hi> among the Jews, called most properly <hi>Ben cozba the lier.</hi>] And the phrase, <hi>A starre falling from heaven,</hi> alludes to <hi>Isa.</hi> 14.12. <hi>How art thou fallen from heaven O Lucifer!</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Trumpet shews the darkning of the Sunne and Moon and Starres for a third part.</p>
                  <p>By which seems to be understood the wane and decay, both in the glory of the Church, by superstition, and of the Empire, by its divisions within, and enemies from without, and this before the rising of the Papacy, which appears under the next Trumpet: and these things were great advantages to its rising. The dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the heavenly luminaries in the Prophets language signifieth the eclipsing of the glory and prosperity of a Kingdom or people, <hi>Isa.</hi> 13.9, 10. <hi>Ioel</hi> 2.10. How it was with the Church and Empire in these respects, before that time that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy appeared, he is a stranger to History, both Ecclesiasticall and Civil, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreth not upon this very hint.</p>
                  <p>The three Trumpets coming are the Trumpets of <hi>Wo, wo, wo:</hi> though these things past were very wofull; but those much more that are to come.</p>

Another starre falling from heaven, and that a notable one indeed, the <hi>He</hi> that hath <hi>the Key of the bottomlesse pit</hi> committed to him. A vast difference from the Keys given <hi>Peter, The Keys of the Kingdom of heaven:</hi> The setting of these in their just distance and opposition will illustrate the matter before us. When the world is to come out of darknesse and Heathenism to the knowledge of the Gospel, <hi>Christ</hi> gives <hi>Peter the Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> to open the door and let light come in among them: for he first preached to the Gentiles, <hi>Act.</hi> 10. &amp; 15.7. The world under the Papacy returns, as it were, to Heathenism again [and not undeservedly for its contempt of the Gospel and unproficiency under it] which is very fitly descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by hell opened, by the Keys of the bottomlesse pit, and darknesse coming and clouding all. The <hi>Claviger</hi> or Turnkey is <hi>The childe of perdition, Abaddon and Apollyon,</hi> a destroyer and one that is surely and sorely to be destroyed. <hi>Chittim [Italy</hi> or <hi>Rome] afflicting and perishing for ever,</hi> Num. 24.24. <hi>Antichrist</hi> of the second edition, much augmented and inlarged. The Jews the first, as we observed at the second Epistle to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> and this the second, <hi>Antichrist</hi> at his full stature. It is true indeed that <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen is one part of him, but observe how little a part reputed in comparison of <hi>Rome</hi> Papish, <hi>the starre fallen from heaven.</hi> So that though that did wofull things, yet you see the <hi>first wo</hi> is fixed here.</p>
                  <p>The way of his bringing wo upon the earth, is by filling the world with smoke and darknesse of ignorance and humane traditions and inventions: and out of this smoke come his locusts, of his votary orders. The locusts described much like those in <hi>Ioel</hi> 1. for their terrour and destroying: only their having the faces of men speaks them men-caterpillers: and their <hi>Nazarite</hi>-like hair long as the hair of women, speaks them votaries; or such as take on them vowed Religion. Their trading is not with grasse or the green things of the earth as other locusts do, but with men, and they are locusts in name, but scorpions in action, wounding with the sting of their tailes [the teacher of lies is the tail, <hi>Isa.</hi> 9.15.] but not killing: leaving men indeed in a Religion and a profession of <hi>Christ,</hi> but no better then a venomed and dying one. The time of their tormenting is five moneths, the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:59067:89"/>
time of locusts ravening ordinarily, from the spring well shot forth, to harvest.</p>
                  <p>This is the first wo.</p>
                  <p>These locusts stings, minde me of a story or two in the <hi>Roman</hi> History: which let me mention here, though I cannot apply them hither. <hi>Dion,</hi> in his story of the life of <hi>Domitian</hi> saith thus, <hi>About that time divers began to prick many whom they pleased, with poysoned needles, whereof many died, hardly feeling what was done to them. And this was practised not only at Rome, but almost through all the world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And again in the life of <hi>Commodus. About that time,</hi> saith he, <hi>there was so great a mortality, that oft times there died two thousand in Rome in one day. And many, not only in the City, but also through the whole Roman Empire, were killed by mischievous men, who poysoning needles pricked others with them: as also it had been in Domiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans time, and so innumerable people died by this means. But there was no greater plague then Commodus himself,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The sounding of the sixth Trumpet begins another wo. Four Angels loosed, which were bound in <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and come with a terrible Army, and horses breathing fire and smoke and brimstone, and having stings in their tailes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Mahumetans</hi> coming as a plague upon the Eastern part of the world, as the <hi>Papacy</hi> on the Western. These hurt with their tailes [false doctrine] as well as the other did in the former Trumpet: but these have also heads in their tailes, which the other had not, for these hold out another Head and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Mahomet.</hi>

                  <p>A Little Book in the hand of <hi>Christ,</hi> speaketh the restoring of Religion, and Truth, after all the darknesse and confusions mentioned before. The words in <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7. do help to state the intent of this Vision. <hi>He sware by him that liveth for ever, that there should be delay of time no longer, but in the daies of the seventh Trumpet the mystery of God should be fulfilled. The mystery of God</hi> is his gathering in of his Elect, more especially of the Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25, 26. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 3.5, 6. and hitherto there had been great hinderance by <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen, by Heresies, <hi>Papacy, Turcism,</hi> but at last <hi>Christ</hi> swears, that there should be <hi>no more delay:</hi> the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> must be taken so here: and not unconsonant to the signification of the word, and very consonant to the context, and to the place from whence this verse is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: That is <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.7. where the Angel is brought in swearing, as here, that the trouble of <hi>Antiochus</hi> and his persecution and hindrance should be so long, and there should be no delay further, but there should be a restoring. That place laid to this, and <hi>Antiochus</hi> looked upon as a figure of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> the construction of this place is easie. Only the great Angel would have the speech of the seven thunders, which referre to these times, to be concealed. The Prophesie in generall intimates the restoring of the Gospel in these later times, which is handled in the next Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, but very generally, and very briefly. <hi>Iohns</hi> eating of the little Book, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 2.8. and the words to him, <hi>Thou must Prophesie again before many Peoples and Nations and Tongues and Kings,</hi> do not so much inferre <hi>Iohns</hi> going abroad after this to preach to many Nations himself, as it doth the progresse of the truth that he preached, through Nations and People, which had been supprest so long: aiming at these times when the Gospel last broke out from under <hi>Popery.</hi> The passage is parallel to the last words in the Book of <hi>Daniel, Go thy way till the end be, for thou shalt rest, and stand in the lot, at the end of daies.</hi> Not that <hi>Daniel</hi> should live till the end of those miseries by <hi>Antiochus,</hi> but that his doctrine, and the truth should stand up and be restored in those times. The phrase is such another as when <hi>Christ</hi> telleth his Disciples that they should sit on twelve Thrones judging the twelve Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> which is not meant of their personall sitting to judge, but that their doctrine should judge and condemn that unbeleeving Nation.</p>

                  <head>REVEL. CHAP. XI.</head>
                  <p>THe Vision of this Chapter is in order to the accomplishing of the <hi>mystery of God,</hi> which was spoken of <hi>Chap.</hi> 10.7. As <hi>Ezekiels</hi> measuring of a new Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, shewed the restoring of Religion and of the Lords people, and foretold of the new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and calling of the Gentiles: To the same purpose is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring of the Temple here. The Church was under the mysticall <hi>Babylon,</hi> Chap. 9. as the Jews were under the Eastern, when <hi>Ezekiel</hi> wrote those things; now as that description of the measures of the Temple, was a prediction and pledge of their coming forth, so this speaketh to the same tenour. <hi>Iohn</hi> is commanded to leave the Court which is without the Temple, forth, and not to measure it, <hi>Because it was given to the Gentiles, and they should tread the holy City fourty and two moneths.</hi> Not in an hostile way, but as the flock of the Lord tread his Courts, there wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping him: as see the phrase, <hi>Isa.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Psal.</hi> 122.2. and the meaning seemeth to be this; <hi>Measure not the Court of the Gentiles, for their multitudes that come to attend upon the Lord shall be boundlesse and numberlesse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>two and fourty moneths:</hi> and a <hi>thousand two hundred and sixty daies,</hi> ver. 3. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.6. <hi>and a time and times and half a time,</hi> Chap. 12.14. are but bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed phrases from <hi>Daniel:</hi> who so expresseth <hi>the three years and an half of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus his persecution,</hi> and treading down Religion, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.25. &amp; 12.7, 11. and they mean times of trouble, and are used to expresse that, but not any fixed time. The Jews themselves have learned to make the same construction of it, when they say <hi>Advianus besieged Bitter three years and an half,</hi> Jerus. Taanith fol. 68. col. 4. And this also [that comfort might stand up against misery] was the time of our Saviours Ministry, when he restored decaied and ruined Religion, in so happy a manner, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.27. And this the Jews also have observed in that saying we have mentioned before, <hi>The divine glory shall stand upon mount Olivet three years and an half, and shall preach,</hi> &amp;c. So that according to this interpretation of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, the things they are applied unto are facil. The Gentiles shall tread the Lords Courts fourty two moneths, and the two Witnesses shall Prophesie a thousand two hundred and sixty daies clothed in sackcloth: Meaning that the Gentiles shall worship God and attend upon him in a Gospel Ministry [and for that, allusion is made to the space of time that <hi>Christ</hi> administred the Gospel] but this ministring and attending shall not be without persecution and trouble [and for intimation of that, allusion is made to the bitter times of <hi>Antiochus.</hi>]</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Two Witnesses,</hi> is a phrase taken from the Law. [<hi>In the mouth of two or of three witnesses every word shall stand</hi>] and it means all that should bear witnesse to the truth in the times spoken of. But more especially the Ministry, which is character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the picture of <hi>Moses and Elias,</hi> the two great Reformers in their severall times: the former, the first Minister of the Jews, the later of the Gentiles. These are <hi>two Olive trees</hi> [See <hi>Zech.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17, 24.] and <hi>two Candlesticks</hi> [See <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.20.] gracious in themselves, and having light, and holding it out to others. They must finish and accomplish their work that they had to do, and then be overcome by Antichrist and slain.</p>
                  <p>Their case is clearly paralleled with <hi>Christ</hi> their Masters; by comparing it with which, it is best understood: He preached three years and six moneths in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and sorrow, so they in sackcloth: He having finished his Ministry was slain, so they. He revived and ascended, so they likewise. Now this that especially states the case, and the counting of the progresse of procedings intended here, is this: That as <hi>Christ</hi> laid the foundation of the Gospel, and when he having finished his Ministry was slain, risen and ascended, the Gospel was not extinct with him, but increased more and more by the Ministry that followed after: So seems this that alludes thereunto to be understood: As, that the two Witnesses should mean the first Ministry, and bearing witnesse to the truth at the first breaking of it out of Popery, which was followed with horrid persecutions and multitudes of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdoms: but these first Witnesses having so done their Testimony, and vast numbers of them having sealed it with their blood, and being gone to heaven,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:59067:90"/>
yet the Gospel increased and shook down a part of <hi>Rome</hi> even at these first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Their dead bodies must be cast in the streets of the great City where our Lord was crucified.</hi> The term <hi>The great City</hi> resolves that <hi>Rome</hi> is meant, if there were no other evidence: which see explained, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.18. And by her power and sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence our Lord was crucified, and for a quarrell of hers, being accused and condemned by <hi>Pilate</hi> as a traytour to the <hi>Roman</hi> power, for saying he was a King. This is the rather mentioned, now there is speech of <hi>Romes</hi> last bloodinesse against <hi>Christs</hi> Witnesses: that it might be shewed that it perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the same, to his, that it had been to him, and that to the last, and that these Witnesses drunk but of the same cup that their Master had drunk before them.</p>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> as the Jews speak] <hi>Sodom and Egypt: Sodom</hi> for filthinesse: and <hi>Egypt</hi> for Idolatry and mercilesnesse, Never did place under heaven wallow in fleshly filthinesse, and particularly in the Sodomitick bestiality, as <hi>Rome</hi> did about those times that <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote: and how little it hath been mended under the Papacy there are Records plain enough that speak to her shame. He that reades <hi>Martiall</hi> and <hi>Iuvenal</hi> [to name no more] may stand and wonder that men should become such beasts: and it had been better that those Books had been for ever smothered in obscurity then that they should have come to light, were it not only for this, that they and others of the like stamp, do give that place her due character, and help us the better to understand her description. It is obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable what <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.21, 22, 23, 24. that because the Heathen had brutish conceptions concerning God, abasing him, he gave them over to brutish abasing their own bodies by bestiality, or indeed by what was above bestiall. And so he shews plainly, that Gods giving up men to such filthinesse, especially <hi>Sodomy,</hi> was a direct plague for their Idolatrous conceptions of God, and their Idolatry. And to this purpose it may be observed that when the Holy Ghost hath given the story of the worlds becoming Heathenish at <hi>Babel</hi> for and by Idolatry, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. he is not long before he brings in mention of this sin among the Heathen, and fearfull vengeance upon it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19. Apply this matter to the case of <hi>Rome</hi> and it may be of good information.</p>
                  <p>The casting their dead bodies in the streets, speaks the higher spite and dete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>station against them: and in this particular they are described different from their Master. And as they had prophesied three years and an half, so they lay unbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried three daies and an half: till there was no apparent possibility of their recovery. But they revive and go to heaven: and a tenth part of the City fals by an Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, and seven thousand perish: but the rest of that part of the City that fell, who perished not, gave glory to God. Nine parts of the City left standing still: whose ruine is working still from henceforward, by the Gospel that these Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses had set on foot: which brings in the Kingdomes to become the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes of Christ, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>AS <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chap. 2. giveth a generall view of the times, from his own daies, to the coming of <hi>Christ,</hi> in the mention of the four Monarchies [in the four parts of <hi>Nebuchadnezzers</hi> Visionary Image] which should runne their date and decay, and come to nothing, before his coming: and then in <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles the very same thing again in another kinde of scheme, and something plainer: And then in <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. &amp; 10. &amp; 11. &amp; 12. doth explain at large, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, some of the most materiall things that he had touched in those generals: So doth our Apocalyptick here, and forward. He hath hitherto given a generall survey of the times from his own daies to the end: and now he goes over some of the chief heads again with explanation.</p>
                  <p>And first he begins with the birth of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Christian Church: and the machination of the devil to destroy both. The Church of the Jews bringeth
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:59067:91"/>
forth her chief childe, and the devil seeketh to destroy him. He is pictured 1. <hi>A great red Dragon.</hi> Old <hi>Pharaoh</hi> who sought to devour new born <hi>Israel</hi> is much of the like character, <hi>Isa.</hi> 27.7. <hi>Psal.</hi> 74.13, &amp;c. 2. <hi>With seven heads:</hi> So many had the persecuting Monarchies, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. the Lion one, the Bear one, the Leopard four, and the fourth beast one. 3. <hi>And ten horns,</hi> Parallel to the <hi>Syrogrecian</hi> persecutors, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.7, &amp;c. 4. <hi>With his tayl he drew and cast down the third part of the starres;</hi> As the Tyrant <hi>Antiochus</hi> had done, <hi>Dan.</hi> 8.10. So that by these allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive descriptions, phrases of old stories fetched to expresse new, is shewed the acting of the devil now, by his mischievous and tyrannicall instruments, with as much bitternesse and bloody-mindednesse as he had done in those. The womans fleeing into the wildernesse, alludes to <hi>Israels</hi> getting away into the wildernesse from the Dragon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. 14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And her nourishing there a thousand two hundred and sixty daies, speaks <hi>Christs</hi> preservation of that Church in the bitterest danger and daies, like the daies of <hi>Antiochus.</hi> This Vision aims at the great opposition and oppression the Church and Gospel underwent from the first rising of it, to the ruine of <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> and their preservation in all that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity.</p>
                  <p>The battel betwixt <hi>Michael</hi> and the <hi>Dragon,</hi> is of the same aim and time with the former; but it speaks thus much further, that the Church is not only preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but the Dragon conquered and cast to the earth. <hi>Heaven</hi> all along in this Book is the Church, the earth therefore may be properly understood of the world, and here more especially of that part of worldly ones, the unbeleeving Jews; and that the rather, because the Gentiles here are called <hi>the wildernesse,</hi> as they be also in severall other places in Scripture. The devil therefore is cast out of the Church by the power of <hi>Michael,</hi> the Lord <hi>Christ,</hi> that he cannot nestle there, and he goes into the rest of the Nation that did not beleeve: much like the tenour of that parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.43, 44, 45. The Woman hath Eagles wings [alluding to <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.4.] and gets into the wildernesse, the persecuted Church and Gospel gets among the Gentiles: The devil casts venom as a flood after the Woman-Church, and <hi>the earth swallows it up:</hi> the unbeleeving Jews do as it were drink up all the poyson of the devil, and together with raging against the Church they grow inraged one against another, and against the <hi>Romans,</hi> till they become their own destroyers. And indeed though it were a most bitter time with the Church while she was among the combustions that that Nation had within it self, yet their raging one against another the more is increased in their particular quarrels, the more it avenged her quarrell, and turned their edge from off her, upon themselves. The devil seeing this, betakes himself to fight against the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans seed, the Church of the Gentiles: and the Treatise of that begins in the next Chapter.</p>

                  <p>When <hi>Rome</hi> hath slain <hi>Christ,</hi> and destroyed <hi>Ierusalem, Satan</hi> gives up his Power and Throne to it; and that deservedly, as to one most like to be his chief and most able agent to act his fury. She is described here, a Beast bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the shape of all the four bloody Monarchies, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. in power and cruelty matching, nay incomparably exceeding them all. There is but little reason to take <hi>Rome</hi> for the fourth Monarchy in <hi>Daniel</hi>; and the so taking it, bringeth much disjoynting and confusion, into the interpreting of that Book and this, and into the stating of affairs and times spoken of in them. The Jews like such a glosse well, as whereby they do conclude, that the <hi>Messias</hi> is not yet come, because the fourth Monarchy the <hi>Romane,</hi> say they, is not yet utterly destroyed. And truly I see not how they can conclude lesse, upon such a concession. For it is plain in <hi>Daniel,</hi> that the four Kingdoms there spoken of, must come to nothing before the first appearing of <hi>Messias</hi>; and that the <hi>Romane</hi> is not, is most plain, since this Book makes <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen and Papal but as one.</p>
                  <p>The Holy Ghost by <hi>Daniel</hi> shews the four Monarchies, the afflicters of the

Church of the Jews<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> till <hi>Messias</hi> his first coming, The <hi>Babylonian,</hi> The <hi>Mede-Persian,</hi> The <hi>Grecian,</hi> and The <hi>Syrogrecian:</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> now takes at him, and shews a fifth Monarchy the afflicter of the Church of Jews and Gentiles till his second coming. <hi>Daniel</hi> indeed gives a hint of the <hi>Romane,</hi> but he clearly distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guisheth him from the other four, when he cals him <hi>the Prince that was to come, Dan</hi> 9.26. beyond and after those four that he had spoken of before. Him <hi>Iohn</hi> describes here, as carrying the character of all those four. <hi>A Beast with ten horns,</hi> such a one had been the <hi>Syrogrecian,</hi> Dan. 7.7. <hi>like a Leopard,</hi> as the <hi>Grecian</hi> was, <hi>ver.</hi> 6. <hi>his feet as a Bears,</hi> such the <hi>Persian,</hi> ver. 5. <hi>his mouth like a Lion,</hi> such the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> ver. 4. This therefore could not be any of those, when it was all: and by this description of it by characters of them all, it shews the vast power and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable cruelty and oppression of it equalling them all: nay it infinitely went beyond them put all together, in extent of Dominions, Power, Continuance and Cruelty, both to the Church and to the world: <hi>Balaam</hi> long before <hi>Rome</hi> was in being doth set it out for the great afflicter, <hi>Num.</hi> 24.24. <hi>Ships shall come from the coasts of Chittim, and shall afflict Assur, and shall afflict Eber:</hi> That <hi>Chittim</hi> means <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> is granted even by some <hi>Romanists</hi> themselves, it is asserted by the Jews, and confirmed by other places of Scripture, and even proved by the very sense and truth of that place. It afflicts both the afflicted and the afflicter <hi>Eber</hi> and <hi>Assur:</hi> and that hath been the garb of it since its first being. How may this be read in her own stories? in her bloody Conquests over all the world: in the titles of honour [but which speak oppression] <hi>Britannicus, Germanicus, Africanus,</hi> and the like? And to take up all in <hi>Epitome,</hi> and that you may conjecture <hi>ex un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue Leonem,</hi> what whole <hi>Rome</hi> hath done in all her time for slaughter, oppression and destroying, take but the brief of one of her Commanders <hi>Pompey the Great</hi>; of whom <hi>Pliny</hi> speaks to this purpose, Nat. Hist. <hi>lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 26. <hi>He recovered Sicily, subdued Africk: subjected</hi> 876 <hi>Towns about the Alpes and coasts of Spain: routed and slew</hi> 2183000 <hi>men.

                  <p>One of his heads had been wounded to death, but his deadly wound was healed: This seemeth to mean her Monarchicall or Kingly power, which was extinguisht with the <hi>Tarquins,</hi> but revived in the <hi>Caesars:</hi> and hereby is given intimation from whence to account the beginning of this fifth Monarchy: namely from <hi>Romes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning again to be Monarchicall: and we may well take a hint of this from <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. where at the birth of <hi>Christ</hi> all the world is taxed by <hi>Caesar Augustus.</hi> Not that Monarchicall Government is therefore the worse because thus abused by <hi>Rome</hi> Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, no more then Religion is the worse for being abused by <hi>Rome</hi> Papall.</p>
                  <p>Another Beast ariseth, like this for power and cruelty, but farre beyond him in consonage and delusion. <hi>Rome Heathen</hi> dealt alwaies openly and in down right tearms of bloodinesse; professedly setting it self to destroy Religion: But <hi>Rome Papall</hi> is <hi>a mystery of iniquity:</hi> it goes to work by deceiving, and carrying fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences: therefore it is said that it spake as a Dragon, but had horns like a Lamb. It revives the tyranny of <hi>Rome</hi> Heathen and Imperiall, and none must thrive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it that will not bear its badge: either some mark, or its name, or the number of its name: which number was the number of a man, and his number is 666. In Hebrew numerals, <hi>Sethur</hi> the name of a man in <hi>Num.</hi> 13.13. comes just to this number: and which being interpreted signifies <hi>Hidden</hi> or <hi>Mystery:</hi> the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of <hi>Rome</hi> it self, <hi>Chap.</hi> 17.5.

                  <p>THe warring twixt <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels, and the Dragon and his Angels, and the Dragons making warre with seed of the Woman, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. receiveth illustration in the thirteenth Chapter, and in the beginning of this. For in <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. he resignes his Power and Throne to the Beast <hi>Rome,</hi> and makes him chief leader in his Warres; and his Angels are men that receive his mark. Here the Lamb upon mount <hi>Zion</hi> is <hi>Michael,</hi> and his Angels and followers are marked with his Fathers Name in their foreheads, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>And now as in the eight, ninth, tenth and eleventh Chapters the relation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning those things that should be against the Church, from henceforth the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie is more especially of things that make for the Church, and against her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. As 1. The preaching of the Gospel to the Gentiles, <hi>ver.</hi> 6, 7. 2. The proclaiming of the ruine of the mysticall <hi>Babylon:</hi> proclaimed even from its first rising up a persecutor: as <hi>Isaiah</hi> did Prophesie against the Eastern, even before its tyrannicall being. 3. The Ministry of the Word giving caution, against joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the Beast and his Image, and the danger and damnation that should fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low upon joyning with him, and the torments described, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10, 11. Here the patience of the Saints tried, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. and <hi>Iohn</hi> by a voice from heaven commanded to write them blessed that die in the Lord from thenceforth, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. at once shewing the bitternesse of the persecution caused by the Beast, that even death should be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable to deliver the Saints from that trouble; and incouraging to stand out against the Beast and his Image even to the death.</p>
                  <p>These bitter dealings against the Church, ripen the sinnes of the world ready for cutting down: and thereupon <hi>Christ</hi> is described coming as against <hi>Egypt, Isa.</hi> 19.1. riding upon a cloud, and with a sickle in his hand to reap the earth. As <hi>Ioel</hi> 3.13. betokening his vengeance against his enemies: So the earth is reaped Harvest and Vintage and all: This is a generall intimation of Gods judgement and vengeance, which is more particularly handled in the pouring out of the Vials, <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>It is observable that the word for reaping of the earth comes out from the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: yea though <hi>Christ</hi> have the sickle in his hand, yet an Angel out of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cals to him to reap: and another Angel comes out of the Temple with a sickle, and a third out of the Temple cals to him to reap: As this may be understood to Doctrinall information, that the cries and urgencies of the Church to <hi>Christ</hi> stirre him up to avenge them on their enemies, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.7. so the expressions may be explained by allusive application. The putting in of the first sickle, to reap the first corn in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> was by the word and warrant of the Priests and Rulers sitting in the Temple, and they that were to reap, when they were come to the corn, put not in the sickle, till the word was given, <hi>Reap.</hi> The manner and managing of this businesse, <hi>viz.</hi> the reaping of the first sheaf is recorded and related by the Talmud: <hi>Menachoth per.</hi> 10. and in <hi>Tosaphta. ibid. These three men,</hi> say they, <hi>that were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Sanhedrin to reap, went out into the valley of Kidron, with a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany following them on the first day of the Passeover week when now it grew towards evening, with three sickles and three baskets. One when they came to the place said to them, On this Sabbath, on this Sabbath, on this Sabbath, In this basket, in this basket, in this basket, With this sickle, with this sickle, with this sickle, Reap: to whom the three answer, Well, well, well, I will reap. The other saies, Reap then. Then they reap,</hi> &amp;c. Thus phrases taken from known customs, do speak the plainer.</p>
                  <p>And so is the expression taken from common speech and opinion, when it is said in <hi>ver.</hi> 30. <hi>The wine-presse was troden without the City, and blood came out of the wine-presse even to the horse bridles.</hi> Here is treading a wine presse of blood, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>WHat was spoken in generall, in the conclusion of the preceding Chapter, concerning the treading of the wine presse of Gods wrath, is here more particularly prosecuted in the story of the seven Vials. At the beginning of which <hi>Iohn</hi> again cals us to reflect upon the scheme of the Temple in heaven: which all along speaks according to the platform of the Temple at <hi>Hierusalem. Here is a sea of glasse mingled with fire, and harpers harping by it,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>singing the song of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:</hi> which as it cals to minde <hi>Moses</hi> and the peoples singing upon the red sea shore upon their delivery from <hi>Egypt,</hi> Exod. 15. so doth it plainly allude to the musick at the Temple, by the laver or sea, and which standing near the Altar was as <hi>a sea of glasse mingled with fire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> sing after the destruction of <hi>Egypt</hi>; for their deliverance was by her destruction, but those here that have got victory over the Beast, sing before he is destroyed, for they are delivered from him and prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him though he stand in his strength, and his destruction be not yet come. The Gospel grew, and <hi>Sanguis Martyrum</hi> was <hi>semen Ecclesiae,</hi> do <hi>Satan</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ</hi> what they can.</p>
                  <p>After this song <hi>The Temple of the Tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> ver. 5. All the whole building upon <hi>Mount Moriah</hi> was called the Temple, the Courts and Cloisters and Chambers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but the very house it self, <hi>The Holy and Holy of Holies</hi> was only and properly <hi>The Temple of the Tabernacle of Testimony:</hi> And the song mentioned before, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. is represented as being in the Court, near the Altar and laver, but now the very House it self is opened: Parallel to what is spoken <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.19. <hi>The Temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen in his Temple, the Ark of his Covenant:</hi> The Lord in pouring out vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Antichrist,</hi> will manifest his judgements, as <hi>ver.</hi> 4. and open his Counsels and Covenant: for while the enemy raged, and raved, and destroyed those that would not worship him, and when even all the world in a manner did worship him, the Lords judgements were hid, and his Covenant with his people, as it were out of sight, or as if no such thing had been, but when this vengeance shall come, then all will be plain.</p>
                  <p>The seven Angels that pour out the seven Vials are charactered in the garb of Priests, coming out of the Temple, in white linen, and girded over the breasts, as the Priests were. One of the living creatures gives the Vials into their hands: the very same sense and carriage with that <hi>Ezek.</hi> 10.7.</p>

                  <p>WEre the Stage where the things of this Book were to be acted, and the time of their acting of as little compasse as was that of the things of <hi>Daniel,</hi> one might with more probability allot the severall things mentioned, to their severall times, as the things in him may be done: But since the scene here is as large as all the world where the Gospel was to come, and the time as long as time shall be; [1600 years past already, and how much behinde none knoweth] to undertake to apply every thing in this Book to its particular time, place and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, is to runne a hazardous undertaking. In some places indeed the things are so plain, that they speak themselves, but in many so obscure that he that will venture to bring them to particular application, doth it more upon his own ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:59067:93"/>
then upon any good textuall warrant: And amongst those obscurities, these Vials are not the least. Take them in a generall interpretation [as I beleeve they are intended] and their meaning is easie to be understood, but to come to allot them severally to this or that time or place, is but to do that, that when ye have done all you can, will come to no surer bottom to rest upon, then your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and supposall.</p>
                  <p>The matter of them is expressed as to the most part, by allusion to the plagues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as boils, blood, darknesse, and so it clears the thing intended, namely in generall to shew how the mysticall <hi>Egypt,</hi> Chap. 11.8. after all her oppression and persecution of the <hi>Israel</hi> of God, should at last come to receive her just re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, as old <hi>Egypt</hi> had done: and that God would follow her with plagues till he had destroyed her. They are somewhat like the plagues of the seven Trumpets, some of which, as we observed, did in generall speak the state of the world till the rising of <hi>Antichrist:</hi> and those Vials may be understood as the generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of his plagues and ruine. We observed in <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. and that upon good Scripture ground, that the six Seals did all but speak one effect, namely the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Jewish Nation, but brought to passe by severall judgements; and the like interpretation may be made here.</p>
                  <p>The first Viall brings a noisom Boyl upon the worshippers of the Beast: this was the sixth plague of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but here the first: for that plague in <hi>Egypt</hi> came home to <hi>Iannes and Iambers</hi> the Magicians, that they could not stand before <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> Exod. 9.11. And that both this and all the rest might be shewed to reach home, even to the veriest deceivers and ringleaders of mischief in <hi>Antichristian Egypt,</hi> this is justly set in the first rank.</p>
                  <p>The second and third here, referre to the one plague of blood in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and these exceed that: For there all the rivers and ponds were indeed turned into blood, but the <hi>Egyptians</hi> digged for water about the river to drink, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.24. and found it and it was not turned into blood: The question and answer of <hi>Aben Ezra</hi> is pertinent. It is said, <hi>there was blood throughout all the Land of Egypt: And the Magicians did so with their inchantments. Now how could the Magicians turn water into blood, when there was no water left, but all was blood?</hi> And he answers, <hi>Aaron only turned the waters that were above ground into blood, not those that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ground:</hi> but here sea and rivers and fountains, and all are become blood: still to shew how throughly the plagues should come home.</p>
                  <p>At these plagues there is mention of <hi>the Angel of the waters,</hi> ver. 5. which, since all the Angels here are characted in the garb of Priests, as hath been said, may also be understood as alluding to that Priest whose office it was to have care of the waters, and to look that there should be water enough and fitting for the people to drink, that came up to the three Festivals: Among the offices of the Priests at the Temple this was one. <hi>Maym. in Kele Mikdash per.</hi> 7. and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> whom the <hi>Talmud</hi> speaks of was of this office, <hi>Aboth R. Nathan per.</hi> 6.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Viall poured into the sunne brings scorching heat; this seems to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude to <hi>Ioshua</hi>'s or <hi>Deborah</hi>'s day, when the starres from heaven fought: the sunne standing still so long did not only give light to <hi>Israel,</hi> but probably heat and faintnesse to the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and <hi>Psal.</hi> 121 6 seems to referre thither, <hi>The sun shall not smite thee by day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As in the fourth they are plagued by the sun, so in the fifth, by want of it. The seat of the Beast darkened as <hi>Pharoahs</hi> Throne and Kingdome was: and this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse bringing horrour and pains; as <hi>Egypts</hi> did through dreadfull apparitions in the dark.</p>
                  <p>The drying up of <hi>Euphrates</hi> for the Kings of the East, under the sixth Viall, seems to speak much to the tenour of the sixth Trumpet, the loosing of the four Angels which were bound at <hi>Euphrates.</hi> Those we conceived the <hi>Turks</hi> to plague Christendom; these we may conceive enemies to plague <hi>Antichrist.</hi> The allusion in the former seems to be to the four Kings from beyond <hi>Euphrates,</hi> that came to scourge <hi>Canaan,</hi> Gen. 14. this to the draining of <hi>Euphrates</hi> for <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> to take <hi>Babylon.</hi> For having to treat here of a <hi>Babylon,</hi> as <hi>ver.</hi> 19. the scene is best represented, as being laid at the old <hi>Babylon.</hi> Now the Historians that mention the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:59067:93"/>
taking of <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> tell us it was by draining the great stream of <hi>Euphrates,</hi> by cutting it into many little channels.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Egyptian</hi> plague of frogs is here translated into another tenour, and that more dangerous; three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, Beast, and false Prophet: spirits of devils working miracles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med betwixt the sixth and seventh Viall [though the acting of the delusions by miracles were all the time of the Beast and false Prophet] because of the judgement now coming: for though all deluders and deluded received their judgements in their severall ages, yet being here speaking of the last judgements of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> they are all summed together. He is here called <hi>the false Prophet,</hi> as being the great deluder of all. The fruit of all these delusions is to set men to fight against God: whose end is set forth by allusion to the Army of <hi>Iabin King of Canaan, Iudg.</hi> 5.19. broken at <hi>the waters of Megiddo.</hi> The word <hi>Armageddon</hi> signifies <hi>a mountain of men cut in pieces.</hi> Here that solemn caution is inserted, <hi>Behold I come as a thief: Blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his garments:</hi> The Priest that walked the round of the Temple guards by night, had torches born before him, and if he found any asleep upon the guard he burnt his cloathes with the torches, <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doth per.</hi> 1. <hi>halac.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>The seventh Viall concludes the Beasts destruction. The great City is said to be divided into three parts: either as <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 5.11, 12. a third part to pestilence, a third part to the sword, and a third part to dispersion, and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in it: or because there is mention of an Earthquake, this speaks its ruining in generall, as <hi>Zech.</hi> 14.4, 5. A tenth part of it fell before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 11.13. and now the nine parts remaining fall in a tripartite ruine.</p>

He is the eight and he of the seven: They that hold <hi>Rome</hi> to be the fourth Monarchy in <hi>Daniel,</hi> cannot but also hold from this place, that that Monarchy is not yet extinct. The ten horns upon the Beast in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.24. are ten Kings arising and succeeding one another in the same Kingdom: but here at <hi>ver.</hi> 12. they are ten severall Kingdoms, all subject to the Beasts both Imperiall and Papall, but at last shall rise up against the mysticall Whore and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy her.

Observe what is said in <hi>ver.</hi> 19. <hi>I saw the Beast, and the Kings of the earth, and their Armies gathered together to make war against him that sate on the horse, and against his Army:</hi> and observe withall, that there is the story of the destruction of the Beast before <hi>Chap.</hi> 18. and of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and marriage Supper of the Lamb before, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.7, 8, 9. therefore the things mentioned here cannot be thought to occurre after those: this there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is a brief rehearsall of what he had spoken from the twelfth Chapter hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, about the battell of <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels with the Dragon and his Angels.</p>

                  <p>THe preceding Section spake what <hi>Christ</hi> did with the Beast and those that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his mark: he fought against them alwaies, and when he saw his time, destroyed them: here the holy Ghost tels us what he did with the devil that set them on: You heard of <hi>Christ</hi> fighting with the Dragon, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. and the Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon foiled and cast out, sets to prosecute the Womans seed: but what course takes he for that? He resignes his Throne, and Power, and Authority, to the Beast <hi>Rome,</hi> and it must do, and it did his businesse for him, <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.3. and how through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it did its masters work, is shewed all along from that place forward. But what becomes of the old Dragon the master of mischief? He sits by, as it were, and looks on while his game is played, and hisses on his Deputy <hi>Rome,</hi> first Imperiall, then Papall. They at the last receive their due wages for their work, Imperiall and Papall go to perdition. But what must become of the Dragon that set them on? It would be very improper to tell so largely of the fearfull vengeance and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction upon the agents, and to say nothing of the principall and chief mover. That therefore is done here, and this Chapter takes at <hi>Chap.</hi> 13.3. and tels you what became of the old Dragon after the resigning of his Throne to the Beast: namely that he sate not at his own quiet as if <hi>Michael</hi> had nothing to do with him, or let him alone, having so much to do with his instruments, but that he curbed and destroyed both principal and agent, and cast them both together into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomlesse pit.</p>
                  <p>The Devil had two waies of undoing men; the Church by persecution, the world by delusion of Oracles, Idolatry, false miracles, and the like. His mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the former by his Deputies the former Chapters have related, and how
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:59067:94"/>
they sped in his service: and this comes to tell how he speeds about the other. The great Angel <hi>Michael,</hi> the Lord Christ, who hath the key of the bottomlesse pit in his hand, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 1.18. chains him by the power of the Gospel, <hi>that he should no more deceive the Nations for a thousand years:</hi> Weigh the phrase, <hi>Not deceive the Nations:</hi> it is not <hi>not persecute,</hi> but <hi>not deceive</hi>; nor is it <hi>the Church,</hi> but <hi>the Nations.</hi> His persecuting of the Church hath been storied before: and here is told how he is curbed for deceiving the Nations, and indeed when he deputed <hi>Rome,</hi> and let that loose for the former, he was chained up as for the later. It is easily construed how Satan <hi>deceived the Nations,</hi> by Idols which are called <hi>a lie, Isa.</hi> 44.20. <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.25. by his Oracles in which was no light, <hi>Isa.</hi> 8.20. and by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicall miracles, which were meer delusion. Hence the world for the time of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenism, is said to be in his Kingdom of darknesse, <hi>Act.</hi> 26.18. <hi>Colos.</hi> 1.13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now the spreading of the Gospel through the world ruined all these before it, and dissolved those cursed spels and charms of delusion, and did as it were chain up <hi>Satan</hi> that he could no more <hi>Deceive the Nations <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> The Heathen</hi> as he had done, by these deceits: so that the words speak the ending of <hi>Satans</hi> power in Heathen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism, and the bringing in of the Gentiles to the knowledge of the truth, out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and delusion.</p>
                  <p>The date of this his chaining up was <hi>a thousand years:</hi> Now the Jews counted the daies of the <hi>Messias, a thousand years,</hi> as we touched before. The <hi>Babylon Talmud in Sanhedrin</hi> in the Chapter <hi>Helek</hi> doth shew their full opinion about the daies of Messias, and amongst other things they say thus: as <hi>Aruch</hi> speaks their words in <hi>voce <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap> It is a tradition of the house of Elijah, that the righteous ones that the blessed God shall raise from the dead, they shall no more return to their dust, but those thousand years that the holy blessed God is to renew the world, he will give them wings as Eagles, and they shall flee upon the waters.</hi> The place in the <hi>Talmud</hi> is in <hi>Sanhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drin fol.</hi> 92. where the text indeed hath not the word <hi>thousand,</hi> but the marginall glosse hath it, and shews how to understand <hi>the thousand years.</hi> And <hi>Aruch</hi> speaks it as a thing of undeniable knowledge and intertainment.

                  </p>
                  <p>As <hi>Iohn</hi> all along this Book doth intimate new stories by remembring old ones, and useth not only the Old Testament phrase to expresse them by, but much allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to customs, language and opinions of the Jews, that he might speak, as it were, closer to them and nearer their apprehensions, so doth he here and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. This later end of his Book remembers the later end of the Book of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> There is a resurrection <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. <hi>Gog and Magog,</hi> Ezek. 38. &amp; 39. and <hi>a new Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> Ezek. 40. and forward. So here a resurrection, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <hi>Gog and Magog,</hi> ver. 8. and <hi>a new Ierusalem,</hi> Chap. 21. &amp; 22.</p>
                  <p>There a resurrection, not of bodies out of the grave, but of <hi>Israel</hi> out of a low captived condition in <hi>Babel.</hi> There a <hi>Gog and Magog,</hi> the <hi>Syrogrecian</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secutors, <hi>Antiochus</hi> and his house: and then the description of the new <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which as to the place and situation was a promise of their restoring to their own Land, and to have <hi>Ierusalem</hi> built again, as it was indeed in the daies of <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah:</hi> but by the glory and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Now the Jews according to their allegoricall vein, applied these things to the daies of <hi>Christ</hi> thus: that first there should be a resurrection caused by <hi>Messias</hi> of righteous ones, then he to conquer <hi>Gog and Magog,</hi> and then there must come <gap reason="foreign">

Megillah fol.</hi> 73. <hi>col.</hi> 1. They are applying particular parts of the great <hi>Hallel</hi> to particular times [what the great <hi>Hallel</hi> was, we shewed a little before.] <hi>And that part,</hi> say they, <hi>I love the Lord because he hath heard me, refers to the daies of Messias: that part, Tye the sacrifice with cords; to the daies of Gog and Magog. And that, Thou art my God and I will praise thee: refers to the world to come.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="170" facs="tcp:59067:95"/>Our Divine Apocalyptick follows <hi>Ezekiel</hi> with an Allegory too, and in some of his expressions alludes to some of theirs, not as approving them, but as speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the plainer to them by them: Here is a resurrection too, but not of bodies neither, for not a word of mention of them, but of souls. <hi>The souls of those that were beheaded for the witnesse of Iesus, lived and reigned,</hi> ver. 4. and yet this is called <hi>The first resurrection,</hi> ver. 5.</p>
                  <p>The meaning of the whole let us take up in parts. There are two main things here intended. First, to shew the ruine of the Kingdom of <hi>Satan,</hi> and secondly, the nature of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ.</hi> The Scripture speaks much of <hi>Christs</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and his conquering <hi>Satan,</hi> and his Saints reigning with him; that common place is briefly handled here: That Kingdom was to be especially among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, they called in unto the Gospel. Now among the Gentiles had been <hi>Satans</hi> Kingdom most setled and potent, but here <hi>Christ</hi> binds him and casts him into the bottomlesse pit that he should deceive no more [as a great cheater and seducer cast into prison] and this done by the coming in of the Gospel among them. Then as for <hi>Christs</hi> Kingdom <hi>I saw Thrones,</hi> saith <hi>Iohn, and they sate upon them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. here is <hi>Christ</hi> and his inthroned and reigning. But how do they reign with him? Here <hi>Iohn</hi> faceth the foolish opinion of the Jews of their reigning with the <hi>Messias</hi> in an earthly pomp; and shews that the matter is of a farre different te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: that <hi>they that suffer with him shall reign with him,</hi> they that stick to him, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse for him, dye for him, these shall sit inthroned with him. And he nameth <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heading</hi> only of all kindes of deaths, as being the most common: used both by Jews and Romans alike, as we have observed before at <hi>Acts</hi> 12. out of <hi>Sanhedr. per.</hi> 7. <hi>halac.</hi> 3. And the first witnesse for Christ, <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> died this death. He saith that such live and reign with <hi>Christ</hi> the thousand years, not as if they were all raised from the dead at the beginning of the 1000 years, and so reign all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him those years out, as is the conceit of some [as absolute Judaism as any is, for matter of opinion] but that this must be expected to be the garb of <hi>Christs</hi> Kingdom all along, suffering and standing out against sinne, and the mark of the Beast and the like: whereas they held it to be a thousand years of earthly bravery and pompousnesse.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the rest of the dead lived not again untill the thousand years were finished: This is the first resurrection:</hi> Not that they lived again when the thousand years were finished, but it means that they lived not in this time which was the time of living, when <hi>Satan</hi> was bound, and truth and life came into the world: The Gentiles, before the Gospel came among them, were <hi>dead,</hi> in Scripture phrase, very copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously: <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.1, 2. &amp; 4.18, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but that revived them, <hi>Ioh</hi> 5.25. <hi>This is the first resurrection,</hi> in and to <hi>Christs</hi> Kingdom: the second is spoken of at the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>verse</hi> of this Chapter that we are upon. <hi>Paul</hi> useth the same expression to signifie the same thing, namely a raising from darknesse and sin by the power of the Gospel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.15. Now when this quickning came among the Gentiles, <hi>Satan</hi> going down, and <hi>Christs</hi> Kingdom advanced, and the Gospel bringing in life and light, as <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1.4. those that did not come and stick close to <hi>Christ</hi> and bear witnesse to him, but closed with the mark of the Beast, sin and sinfull men, these were dead still and lived not again till the thousand years were finished, that is, while they lasted, though that were a time of receiving life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Blessed therefore and holy are they that have part in this first resurrection, for on them the second death hath no power,</hi> ver. 6. The <hi>second death</hi> is a phrase used by the Jews. <hi>Onkelos</hi> renders <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.6. thus, <hi>Let Reuben live and not die the second death.</hi> And <hi>Ionathan,</hi> Isa. 65.6. thus, <hi>Behold it is written before me, I will not grant them long life, but I will pay them vengeance for their sins, and deliver their carcases to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 15. <hi>The Lord will slay them with the second death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Observe in the Prophet that these verses speak of the ruine and rejection of the Jews, now a cursed people, and given up to the second death: and in Chapter 66. <hi>ver.</hi> 29, 30, 31. is told how the Lord would send and gather the Gentiles to be his people, and would make them his Priests and Levites: And then see how fitly this verse answers those. In stead of these cursed people, these are blessed and holy, and might not see the second death, and <hi>Christ</hi> makes them Priests to himself and his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:59067:95"/>In this passage of <hi>Iohn</hi> scorn is put again upon the Jews wild interpretation of the resurrection in <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> They take it litterally, think some dead were really raised out of their graves, came into the Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> begat children, and died a second time: Nay they stick not to tell who these men were, and who were their children. <hi>Talm. Babyl. in Sanhedr. ubi supra.</hi>

                  <p>After the thousand years are expired, Satan is let loose again, and fals to his old trade of the deceiving the Nations again, ver. 8. <hi>Zohar. fol.</hi> 72. <hi>col.</hi> 286. hath this saying: <hi>It is a tradition, that in the day when judgement is upon the world, and the holy blessed God sits upon the Throne of judgement, then it is found that Satan that deceives high and low, he is found destroying the world, and taking away souls.</hi> When the Papacy began, then Heathenism came over the world again, and <hi>Satan</hi> as loose and deceiving as ever: then Idolatry, blindnesse, deluding oracularities and miracles as fresh and plenteous as before: from the rising of the Gospel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Gentiles these had been beating down, and <hi>Satan</hi> fettered and imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deeper and deeper every day: and though his agent <hi>Rome</hi> bestird it self hard to hold up his Kingdom, by the horrid persecutions it raised, yet still <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he Gospel prevailed and laid all flat. But when the Papacy came, then he was loose again, and his cheatings prevailed and the world became again no better then Heathen. And if you should take the thousand years fixedly and literally, and begin to count either from the beginning of the Gospel in the preaching of <hi>Iohn,</hi> or of <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Cornelius</hi> the first inlet to the Gentiles, or of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> their being sent among them, the expiring of them will be in the very depth of Popery; especially begin them from the fall of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where the date of the Gentiles more pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly begins, and they will end upon the times of Pope <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> when if the devil were not let loose, when was he?</p>
                  <p>He cals the enemies of the Church, especially <hi>Antichrist, Gog</hi> and <hi>Magog:</hi> the title of the <hi>Syrogrecian</hi> Monarchy, the great persecutor, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 38. &amp; 39.

The destruction of which is set down, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. by fire from heaven, in allusion to <hi>Sodom,</hi> or to 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1.10, 12. and it is set close to the end of the world: the Devil and the Beast [<hi>Rome</hi> imperiall] and the false Prophet [<hi>Rome</hi> Papall] are cast into fire and brimstone, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. where <hi>Iohn</hi> speaks so, as to shew his method, which we have spoken of. <hi>The devill was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the Beast and the false Prophet are:</hi> He had given the story of the beast and false Prophet, the devils agents, and what became of them, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19. <hi>v.</hi> 20.

                     <hi>Ezekiels Ierusalem,</hi> as we observed, was of a double signification, namely as
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:59067:96"/>
promising the rebuilding of the City after the Captivity, and foretelling of the spirituall <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the Church under the Gospel, and that most especially: At that <hi>Iohn</hi> taketh at here, and that is the <hi>Ierusalem</hi> that he describeth. And from <hi>Isa.</hi> 65.17, 18. joyneth the creating new heavens and a new earth; and so stateth the time of building this new <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> namely at the coming in of the Gospel, when all things are made new, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. A new people, new Ordinances, new Oeconomy, and the old world of <hi>Israel</hi> dissolved. Though the description of this new City be placed last in the Book, yet the building of it was contemporary with the first things mentioned in it about the calling of the Gentiles. When God pitched his Tabernacle amongst them, as he had done in the midst of <hi>Israel,</hi> Levit. 26.11, 12. That Tabernacle is pitched in the fourth and fifth Chapters of this Book: And now all tears wiped away and no more sorrow, death nor pain, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. which if taken litterally could referre to nothing but the happy estate in heaven [of which the glory of this <hi>Ierusalem</hi> may indeed be a figure] but here, as the other things are, it is to be taken mystically or spiritually, to mean the taking away the curse of the Law, and the sting of death and sinne, <hi>&amp;c.

He concludeth, <hi>These sayings are faithfull and true,</hi> so he had said before at the marriage of the Lamb, <hi>Chap.</hi> 19.9. and again at his begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the story of the new <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> Chap. 21.5. referring to the severall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies that had been of these things, and now all those sayings and Prophecies
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:59067:96"/>
were come home in truth and faithfulnesse. He is commanded not to seal his Book, as <hi>Daniel</hi> was, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.4. because the time of these things was instantly beginning, and <hi>Christs</hi> coming to reveal his glory in avengement upon the Jewish Nation and casting them off, and to take in the Gentiles in their stead was now at the door, within three and an half or thereabout to come, if we have conjectured the writing of this Book to its proper year. There are two years more of <hi>Nero,</hi> and one of confusion in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in the Warres of <hi>Otho, Vitellius</hi> and <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and the next year after <hi>Ierusalem</hi> fals.</p>
                  <p>And thus if this Book of the <hi>Revelation</hi> were written last of the Books of the new Testament, as by the consent of all it was, then may we say, Now was the whole will of God revealed and committed to writing, and from henceforth must Vision and Prophesie and Inspiration cease for ever. These had been used and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted all along for the drawing up of the minde of God into writing, as also the appearing of Angels had been used, for the further and further still revealing of his will, and when the full revelation of that was compleated, their appearing, and revelations to men must be no more. So that this <hi>Revelation</hi> to <hi>Iohn</hi> was the topping up and finishing of all revelations. The Lord had promised that <hi>in the last daies</hi> [of <hi>Ierusalem] he would pour down of his Spirit upon all flesh,</hi> Act. 2.17. And <hi>Christ</hi> promised to his Apostles, that he would lead them into <hi>all</hi> truth, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 16.12.13. To look for therefore the giving of those extraordinary gifts of the Spirit beyond the fall of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> there is no warrant; and there is no need, since when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired penmen had written all that the holy Ghost directed to write, <hi>All truth</hi> was written.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be denied indeed, that those that had these extraordinary gifts before the fall of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> if they lived after, had them after, for the promoting of these ends for which they were given, but there is neither ground nor reason whereupon to beleeve, that they were restored to the next generation, or were or are to be imparted to any generation for ever. For as it was in <hi>Israel</hi> at the first setling of their Church, so was it in this case in the first setling of the Gospel. The first fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> in the wildernesse, were indued with Divine gifts, such as we are speaking of, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.25. but when that generation was expired, those that were to succeed in that Function and imployment, were such as were qualified for it by education, study and parts acquired. So was it with this first age of the Gospel and the ages succeeding. At the first dispersing of the Gospel, it was absolutely needfull that the first planters should be furnished with such extraordinary gifts, or else it was not possible it should be planted. As this may appear by a plain instance. <hi>Paul</hi> comes to a place where the Gospel had never come: he staies a moneth or two and begets a Church, and then he is to go his way and to leave them: Who now in this Church is fit to be their Minister? they being all alike but very children in the Gospel: but <hi>Paul</hi> is directed by the holy Ghost to lay his hands upon such and such of them, and that bestows upon them the gift of tongues and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sying, and now they are able to be Ministers and to teach the Congregation. But after that generation, when the Gospel was setled in all the world, and committed to writing, and written to be read and studied: then was study of the Scriptures the way to inable men to unfold the Scriptures and fit them to be Ministers to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct others: and Revelations and Inspirations neither needfull nor safe to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after, nor hopefull to be attained unto. And this was the reason why <hi>Paul</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but newly out of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Crete,</hi> when he could have ordained and qualified Ministers with abilities by the imposition of his hands, would not do it, but left <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> to Ordain, though they could not bestow those gifts: because he knew the way that the Lord had appointed Ministers thence forward to be inabled for the Ministry, not by extraordinary infusions of the Spirit, but by serious study of the Scriptures, not by a miraculous, but by an ordinary Ordination. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he gives <hi>Timothy</hi> himself counsell to study, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13. though he were plentifully indued with these extraordinary indowments, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. And <hi>Paul</hi> himself had his Books for study, or he had them to no purpose, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13.</p>
                  <p>And indeed it hath been the way of God, he hath instructed his people by a
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:59067:97"/>
studious and learned Ministry, ever since he gave a written word to instruct them in. 1. Who were the standing Ministry of <hi>Israel</hi> all the time from the giving of the Law to the Captivity into <hi>Babel?</hi> Not Prophets, or those inspired men [for they were but occasionall Teachers, and there were often long spaces of time wherein no Prophet appeared] but the Priests and Levites that became Learned in the Law by study, <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.10. <hi>Hos.</hi> 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 6. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. And for this end as hath been touched, they were disposed into 48 Cities of their own, as so many Universities, where they studied the Law together, and from thence were sent out into the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Synagogues to teach the people: and had the Tithes paid them for their main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance whilest they studied in the Universities, and for their preaching in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues. And it may be observed that even they that had the prophetick spirit did not only study the Scriptures themselves, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.1. but sent the people for instruction to the Priests who were students and the standing Ministry, <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. 2. If you consider the times under the second Temple, then it was utterly impossible that the people should be taught but by a studious and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Ministry; for the spirit of Prophesie was departed, and the Scriptures were then in an unknown tongue, to all but Students. And hence they had an interpreter in every Synagogue to render into the Vulgar, what was read in the Law and the Prophets in the Originall. So that the Spirit of God inspired certain persons whom he pleased to be the revealers of his will till he had imparted and committed to wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting what he thought fit to reveal under the Old Testament, and when he had compleated that, the holy Ghost departed, and such inspirations ceased. And when the Gospel was to come in, then the Spirit was restored again, and bestowed upon severall persons for the revealing further of the minde of God, and compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work he had to do, for the setling of the Gospel, and penning of the New Testament, and that being done, these gifts and inspirations cease, and may no more be expected then we may expect some other Gospel yet to come.</p>

IN this thirteenth Year of <hi>Nero</hi> therefore, <hi>Vespasian</hi> cometh Generall into <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,</hi> to undertake that Warre: A second <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>; an instrument of the Lord raised up to execute his vengeance upon that Nation, now the Nation of his curse, and to destroy their City and Temple as the other had done. And as severall strange occurrences befell that destroyer, recorded in the Book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> so did divers strange things also befall this, recorded by the <hi>Roman</hi> Historians with one consent. As <hi>Nilus</hi> flowing a handfull higher on that day that he came into <hi>Alexandria,</hi> then ever it did in one day before. A Vision that he had in the Temple of <hi>Serapis,</hi> of his servant <hi>Basilides,</hi> who was known to be at that instant fourscore miles off sick. And especially his healing of a blinde mans eyes by anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them with his spittle, and curing a lame mans hand, by treading upon it with his foot: To which may be added those that were accounted the presages of his reigning, as a cypresse tree in his ground, clean rooted up by the windes over night, grew strait up again, and well in the morning. An Ox came and laid him down at his feet, and laid his neck under his feet, at one time as he sat at meat;
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:59067:98"/>
and a dog came and brought him a dead mans hand, at another. Now not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute whether <hi>all</hi> these things were true or no, nor by what power they were wrought: certainly they set the man in the eyes of men, as a man of rarity: and as he was designed by God for a singular work, so did these things make him to be a man looked upon as one of some singular <hi>omen</hi> and fortune.</p>
            <p>His work in the Jewish Warres this year was more especially in <hi>Galilee:</hi> where first coming to <hi>Ptolemais,</hi> the men of <hi>Sipphoris,</hi> the greatest City there, come peaceably and yieldingly to him; and they had done so indeed before to <hi>Cestius Gallus. Iosephus</hi> who afterward wrote the History of these Warres, was now a great party in them, having fortified many Cities and places in <hi>Galilee,</hi> and being the chiefest that in those parts stood against the <hi>Romanes.</hi> First he findes them work at <hi>Iotepata,</hi> which indures a very sharp siege, and puts the <hi>Romanes</hi> to very sharp service before it be taken: At last after about fifty daies siege <hi>Vespasian</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it, <hi>Iuly</hi> 1.

VESPASIAN therefore having subjected, and setled <hi>Galilee,</hi> he fals this year to work in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> and indeed there the Jews fall to bitter work among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. For all the unquiet spirits whom the Warre had prosecuted and hunted from other parts, or whose turbulency desired to be in action, were flocked hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; so that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Iudaea</hi> were filled full of men and trouble: and quickly full of famine, blood and all manner of misery. The dolefull story <hi>Iosephus</hi> gives at large, as also what the <hi>Romanes</hi> did among them this year, <hi>de Bello lib.</hi> 4. whither the reader may have recourse.</p>
            <p>This year <hi>Nero</hi> died by his own hand, to escape publick and more shamefull execution. In him ended the Blood and Family of the <hi>Caesars:</hi> And now that mystery of State was discovered, <hi>That an Emperour could be made, though not of that Blood, and elsewhere then at Rome:</hi> and the misery of the State accrewed by that discovery, when the longest sword did make the Emperour, and the trying which was the longest, undid the Empire. The souldiery in <hi>Spain</hi> proclaimed <hi>Galba</hi> to succeed him: against whom riseth up <hi>Otho,</hi> and cuts him off when he was now reigning, but in his seventh moneth, having only brought the Royalty into his family; and himself to misery and ruine by it. When he was slain a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon souldier cut off his head, and putting his finger into his mouth [for he was bald, and therefore he could not bear it by the hair] he carried it to <hi>Otho,</hi> who gave it to the scum and black guard of the Camp, and they fixing it upon a pole, carried it up and down in derision.</p>

OTHO was scarce set in the Throne, when <hi>Vitellius</hi> riseth up against him: and the determination of this competition was not so speedy and unsensible as was that betwixt <hi>Galba</hi> and <hi>Otho:</hi> For <hi>Otho</hi> slew <hi>Galba</hi> without any noise, and when himself had but three and twenty associates at his first conspiring against him: But the present quarrell shook a good part of the Empire, with sidings and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations;
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:59067:98"/>
and came to a pitcht battell before it came to an end. <hi>Otho</hi>'s men lost the field, and when tidings of his defeat came to him, he resolved to strive no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, but to render up his Empire and life together, and so slew himself. He reigned, if it may be called a reign, but 95 daies.</p>

VITELLIUS is now Lord of all; who indeed is not Master of himself. A man of that untemperance and luxury, that few equalled him: and divers that did follow him and his course, died of surfets. Divers men and Cities were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by his riotous excesses, and the souldiers became effeminate by his example. In the time of his reign which ended before this year was out, there were divers prodigies: A Comet: Two Suns at the same time, one in the East, another in the West. The Moon twice eclipsed unnaturally. In the Capitol the footsteps seen of many and great <hi>Daemones</hi> coming down from thence. And <hi>Iupiters</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple opened of its own accord with horrid noise. And let this be reckoned for a prodigy too, <hi>Maricus</hi> a man of an ordinary extraction among the <hi>Boii,</hi> raised a considerable number of men, and proclaimed himself a God. He was soon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown and thrown to the wilde beasts, whom when they rent not in pieces, it heightened the peoples opinion in thoughts that he was a God indeed; but <hi>Vitellius</hi> found another way to put him to death, and so his Godship was spoiled.</p>
            <p>There were divers petty mutinies of the Armies, and destroying of Towns in <hi>Italy</hi> and other parts before <hi>Vespasian</hi> stird: but when he stood up, there were concussions that made all the Empire to shake, as it had hardly ever done before. He was then in the East about the Warres of the Jews, as we have touched instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly before: And there the Armies in <hi>Egypt, Iudaea</hi> and <hi>Syria</hi> swear fealty to him in the moneth of <hi>Iuly.</hi> And in a short time all the Provinces even to <hi>Achaia</hi> did the like. The Legions in <hi>Maesia, Illyricum, Pannonia</hi> fall to him, and letters are sent into <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> to move them to the like, and they prevail with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vitellius</hi> this while, follows his riotous courses: and marches towards <hi>Rome</hi> with 60000 men in Arms, but in no discipline: and a rabble of Ruffians that were of his roaring humour, exceeding that number. And these numbers were made numberlesse, by the conflux of all sorts of people, out of the City to meet him. Corn was trod down, the souldiers quarrelled: the people was abused wounded and slain, and they had the face of a Warre among themselves. In such a confused march they come into the City, and there take up their quarters, but in all looseness, luxury and security.</p>
            <p>At last <hi>Vespasians</hi> party breaks into <hi>Italy,</hi> and gives them a through Alarm: in a short time they come to a battell at <hi>Cremona,</hi> where that poor Town is ruined, and left as a monument of those combustions: and another memoriall not to be omitted, A sonne on the one party, killed his father on the other, and perceived and deplored what he had done, as soon as he had done it. And thus these tumults grew on to that height, that in fine they fight it out in <hi>Rome</hi> it self, fire the Capitol, plunder the City, slay <hi>Vitellius,</hi> subdue his party, and <hi>Vespasian</hi> becomes conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and Emperour. Think here of <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.7.</p>

VESPASIAN all this while was in <hi>Egypt:</hi> at <hi>Alexandria</hi> he receives tydings of his parties successe, and thither is such conflux of Friends, Ambassadors, and Allies, to congratulate and homage him, that that City, though the second in the Empire, was little enough to intertain the company gathered thither. <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius</hi> his fall was in <hi>December,</hi> the later end of the last year: and <hi>Vespasian</hi> did
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:59067:99"/>
wait in the beginning of this, but till he could settle affairs there where he was, and till he might have good weather at sea, and then he sets for <hi>Italy:</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> his son parting with him at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> sets for <hi>Iudea,</hi> to make some end of those Warres.</p>
            <p>And here we cannot but take in two passages for Chronology sake, which help well to measure the time that we are just now upon. The one is this of <hi>Dion Cas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius,</hi> in the life of <hi>Vespasian. From the death of Nero to the reign of Vespasian, there intercurred but one year and two and twenty daies. And I write this, least any should misreckon; giving the whole time to every one that reigned. For they did not succeed one another, but one reigned in the time of another: So that their years are not to be counted, by their succeeding one another, but according to the exact course of the time it self.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The other is out of <hi>Iosephus,</hi> who once and again tels that the fall of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was <hi>in the second year of Vespasian. De Bell. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 47<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And yet in recording the story and times of the sacking of it, he doth plainly place it in that year, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Annals write <hi>Vespasians first:</hi> as it will be obvious to observe, to any that peruseth them and him. His computation therefore must be cast by his own counters: for he accounteth the beginning of his reign from the time that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in the East proclaimed him, and swore fealty to him: which was in <hi>Iuly:</hi> and in <hi>September</hi> twelvemoneth after <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was taken; at which time <hi>Vespasian</hi> was entred indeed upon a second year from the time of his proclaiming; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this calculation it is that <hi>Iosephus</hi> reckoneth: whereas <hi>Vitellius</hi> was alive and fought it out many moneths after <hi>Vespasian</hi> was proclaimed: therefore the <hi>Roman Fasti</hi> do very properly begin his first year from the beginning of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> this year that we are upon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Titus</hi> coming into <hi>Iudaea,</hi> and there gathering all his forces together, marcheth against <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and pitcheth his siege against it, when now the Passeover festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vall had called all the people of the Country in thither: For as the turbulencies and intestine commotions in the bowels of the Empire it self the last year, had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Jews some respite from the <hi>Roman</hi> Armies, so had they given them some boldnesse and security, seeing <hi>Vespasian</hi> and his Forces were now forced to turn their faces another way; and they hoped they would hardly have turned towards them again. How much they were deceived, <hi>Titus</hi> without, and Famine and all miseries within did soon shew them. What were the passages in this siege, and what Famine, Pestilence, Civil slaughters, and various kindes of death the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged suffered in it, are so largely described by <hi>Iosephus,</hi> that it were but a need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse rehearsall to speak of them: The end was, that the Temple and City were raked up in ashes: eleven hundred thousand perished in the siege; almost an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand taken prisoners, and the Nation ruined from what they had been. That this desolation is phrased in Scripture as the desolating of the whole world, [as we have had occasion to observe divers times by severall passages that we have met withall referring thereunto] it will appear no wonder, if we consider that it was the destroying of the old peculiar Covenanted people; of the Lords own ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, Ordinances, and place chosen by him above, nay alone of all the places of the world, to put his Name there. A people once highest in his favour, now deepest in his displeasure: once blessed with his greatest dignations, above any, nay above all the people under heaven, and now fallen under his heaviest indignation. A people of his curse, and who have left their name for a curse to his chosen. And a new world [as it were] now created, a new people made the Church, a new Oeconomy, and <hi>Old things past, and all things become new,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17.</p>
            <p>We are now upon a very remarkable and eminent Period; where should I write an Ecclesiasticall History, I should begin, as at the beginning of a new world: not but that the Calling of the Gentiles had begun before, for the Gospel was now gone through all the world: and the Jews were also given up before as to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of them, when the holy Ghost cals them <hi>dogs,</hi> and a <hi>Synagogue of Satan:</hi> but their State and Oeconomy was not till now rooted up, nor the Divine Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances once planted among them till now extinguished: and their casting off sealed by the ruine of their City, dispersion of their Nation, and their finall obduration.</p>

               <head>§. I. The Desolation of the Temple and City.</head>
               <p>THe Temple was burnt down, as <hi>Iosephus</hi> a spectator setteth the time, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>On the tenth day of the moneth Lous:</hi> which he saith was a fatall day to the Temple, for it had been burnt down by the <hi>Babylonians</hi> before on that day, <hi>De Bell. lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 27. And yet his Countrimen that write in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew tongue, fix both these fatalities to the ninth day of that moneth which they call the moneth <hi>Ab</hi>; and they account that day fatall for three other sad occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences besides: <hi>On the ninth day of the moneth Ab,</hi> say they, <hi>the decree came out against Israel in the wildernesse that they should not enter into the Land: On it was the destruction of the first Temple, and on it was the destruction of the second. On it the great City Bitter was taken, where there were thousands and ten thousands of Israel, who had a great King over them</hi> [Ben Cozba] <hi>whom all Israel, even their greatest wise men thought to have been Messias: But he fell into the hands of the Heathen, and there was great affliction, as there was at the destruction of the Sanctuary. And on that day, a day allotted for vengeance, The wicked Turnus Rufus plowed up the place of the Temple, and the places about it, to accomplish what is said, Sion shall become a plowed field.</hi> Talm. in Taanith. per. 4. halac. 6. Maymon. in Taanith per. 5.</p>
               <p>It is strange men of the same Nation, and in a thing so signall, and of which both parties were spectators, should be at such a difference: and yet not a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence neither, if we take <hi>Iosephus</hi> his report of the whole story, and the other Jews construction of the time. He records that the Cloister walks commonly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>The Porches of the Temple,</hi> were fired on the eight day, and were burning on the ninth, but that day <hi>Titus</hi> called a Council of Warre, and carried it by three voices, that the Temple should be spared: but a new busling of the Jews caused it to be fired, though against his will, on the next day: <hi>Ioseph. ubi supr. cap.</hi> 22, 23, 24. Now their Kalendar reckons, from the middle day of the three that fire was at it as from a Center: and they state the time thus: <hi>It was the time of the evening, when fire was put to the Temple, and it burnt till the going down of the Sunne of the next day. And behold what Rabban Iochanan ben Zaccai saith: If I had not been in that generation I should not have pitched it upon any other day but the tenth, because the most of the Temple was burnt that day. And in the Ierusalem Talmud it is related that Rabbi, and Ioshua ben Levi fasted for it the ninth and tenth daies both.</hi> Gloss. in Maym. in Taanith per. 5.</p>
               <p>Such another discrepancy about the time of the firing of the first Temple by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> may be observed in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 25.8, 9. where it is said, that <hi>In the fifth moneth, on the seventh day of the moneth, came Nebuzaradan Captain of the guard, and burnt the House of the Lord.</hi> And yet in <hi>Ierem.</hi> 52.12. it is said to have been <hi>In the fifth moneth, on the tenth day of the moneth.</hi> Which the <hi>Goma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rists</hi> in the <hi>Babylon</hi> Talmud reconcile thus: <hi>It cannot be said on the seventh day, because it is said On the tenth: Nor can it be said, On the tenth day, because it is said On the seventh. How is it then? On the seventh the aliens came into the Temple, and ate there and defiled it, the seventh, eight and ninth daies, and that day towards night they set it on fire: and it burnt all the tenth day, and was the case also with the second Temple.</hi> Taanith fol. 29.</p>
               <p>The ninth and tenth daies of the moneth <hi>Ab</hi> on which the Temple was burnt down, was about the two and three and twentieth of our <hi>Iuly:</hi> and the City was taken and sacked the eight day of <hi>September</hi> following: <hi>Ioseph. ubi supr. cap.</hi> 47. That day being their Sabbath day, <hi>Dion fol.</hi> 748.</p>
               <p>After eleven hundred thousand destroyed and perished in the siege and sacking, and ninety seven thousand taken prisoners, <hi>Titus</hi> commanded City and Temple to be razed to the ground, only three of the highest Towers left standing, <hi>Phasaelus, Hippicus</hi> and <hi>Mariamme,</hi> and the Western Wall of the City: those, that they might remain as monuments of the strength of the place, and thereby of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown

of the <hi>Roman</hi> Conquest: and this, that it might be of some use to the <hi>Roman</hi> Garrison that was left there, which was the tenth Legion. Their chief Captain was <hi>Terentius Rufus,</hi> a man of exceeding frequent mention in the Hebrew Writers, but his former name a little shortened, yet a little added which makes it long enough, for they constantly call him <gap reason="foreign">

Of this <hi>Ananias Sagan</hi> there is mention in the Talmud text severall times: we will take but one instance, <hi>Shekalim</hi> per. 6. halac. 1. <hi>There were thirteen worshippings or bowings in the Temple, but the house of Rabban Gamaliel, and the house of Ananias Sagan made fourteen.</hi> The <hi>Sagan</hi> was, as it were, Vice-Highpriest, the next to him in Dignity and Office, and is sometimes called <hi>the Highpriest,</hi> as <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.2. And it may be this was the man, and bare that title, <hi>Act.</hi> 23.2, 4. the enemy of <hi>Paul,</hi> and whose character and doom he reads, that he was a whited wall, and God would smite him: accomplished when he perished in the fall of the City.</p>
               <p>We may not omit the calculation of the time that the Jews make further, of the Temples burning: <hi>When the first Temple was destroyed,</hi> say they, <hi>it was the evening on the ninth of Ab, it was the going out of the year of release, and it was the going out of the Sabbath: And so was it with the second Temple.</hi> Tal. Bab. <hi>ubi supr.</hi> Observe, by their confession the Temple was burnt down upon the Lords day, or on the Christian Sabbath. Fire put to it upon their Sabbath, and it burnt all ours: And so the City fell upon their Sabbath, as was mentioned out of <hi>Dion</hi> even now.</p>

               <p>It appears by the constant and copious testimony of the Jews, that the City and Temple were not only laid flat by fire, ruine, and demolishment, but that <hi>Turnus
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:59067:100"/>
Rufus</hi> brought a plow over them to make good that Prophesie, <hi>Zion shall be plowed as a field:</hi> The plowman would finde but rugged work: They allot it, as observed before, to have been on the same day of the year, and so a twelvemoneth at the least must intercede.</p>
               <p>What the beauty of the place had been, needs no Rhetorick to set it forth, nor what the populousnesse; the Temple, if there had been no other goodly stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, was enough to speak the one, and the multitude of their Synagogues the other: their own records summe them up to four hundred and threescore. <hi>R. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nehas in the name of R. Hoshaiah saith there were</hi> 460 <hi>Synagogues in Ierusalem, and every one had a house for the Book of the Law for the publick reading of that, and a house for the publick teaching and explaining the traditions.</hi> Jerus. Chetub. fol. 35. col. 3. which in <hi>Megillah</hi> fol. 73. col. 4. and in <hi>R. Solomon</hi> upon the first of <hi>Isaiah</hi> are reckoned up to four hundred and fourscore. But now not one relick left, of Temple, Synagogue, Midrash, House, or any thing else but rubbish and desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Her people used this custom while she stood, that <hi>on all other daies of the year the unclean walked in the middle of the street, and the clean by the houses sides, and the unclean said unto them, Keep off: But on the daies of the festivals, the clean walked in the middle of the street, and the unclean by the house sides, and then the clean bid Keep off.</hi> Jerus. Shekalin fol. 51. col. 1. But now where is that company, that nicenesse, nay where are the streets? <hi>Titus</hi> himself some time after the deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, coming that way, could not but bemoan the fall of so brave a City, and cursed the Rebels that had occasioned so fatall a destruction: <hi>Ioseph. De Bell. lib.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 15.</p>
               <p>How the Country neer about was wasted with so long and terrible a siege, and indeed the whole Country with so dreadfull a Warre, it is easier conceived then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. <hi>Iosephus</hi> tels particularly much of it, and this thing for one, That all the timber twelve miles about the City was cut down, and brought in to make forts and engines for the siege, <hi>lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 40.</p>
               <p>We may take a view of the whole Country as to the surface and situation of it in this prospective of their own: <hi>The Land</hi> [say they] <hi>that Israel possessed that came out of Babylon, was these three Countries, Iudaea, Galilee and Beyond Iordan, and these were severally tripartite again. There was Galilee the upper, and Galilee the neather, and the Vale. From Caphar Hananiah upward, all that bears not Syca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores, is Galilee the upper, and from Caphar Hananiah downward all that doth bear Sycamores is Galilee the lower, and the border of Tiberias is the Vale. And in Iudaea, there is the Mountanous, and the Plain, and the Vale. And the plain of Lydda is as the plain of the South, and the mountanous thereof as the mountain royall: From Bethoron to the sea is one Region:</hi> Sheviith per. 9. halac. 2. The <hi>Ierusalem</hi> Gomarists do adde thus, <hi>What is the vale in Galilee? The vale of Genezareth and the adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. What is the mountanous in Iudaea? This is the mountain royall; and the plain thereof is the plain of the South, and the vale is from Engedi to Iericho. And what is the mountanous beyond Iordan? R. Simeon ben Eleazar saith, The hills of Macvar, and Gedor: And the plain thereof Heshbon and all her Cities, Dibon, Bamoth Baal, and Beth Baal Meon. And the vale is Beth Haran, and Beth Nimrah.</hi> Sheviith fol. 38. col. 4.</p>

               <p>Though therefore the Country were extreamly wasted, with so long and so fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a Warre, yet was it not utterly waste, nor the Nation destroyed from being a people, though it were destroyed from being what it had been. Those places and persons that had quietly submitted to the <hi>Roman</hi> power, if they had escaped

the fury of their own seditions ones, were permitted to live in quiet, yea to injoy their own Religion and Laws, they in the mean while demeaning themselves as peaceable subjects, to that power that had brought them under. And for one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of that subjection, they were injoyned to pay that <hi>Didrachma</hi> or half shekel that they usually paid to the Temple for their lives, to <hi>Iupiter Capitolinus, Xiphil. apud Dionem.</hi> pag. 748.</p>
               <p>Their <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> continued in the same lustre and state, as it had done for many years before the City fell: and their Synagogues in the same posture, and their Religion in the same condition, save only those parts of it, which were confined to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which was now in the dust. And generally the places and people that had escaped the Warre, if they would live quiet, did injoy their quietnesse, as well as men could do in a Land in such a condition as into which it was now brought.</p>

He spake and acted for <hi>Caesar</hi> as much and as long as he durst, and when he saw he could no longer be in safety in the City, he caused his Scholars <hi>R. Ioshua</hi> and <hi>R. Eliezer</hi> to carry him forth upon a Bier as a dead corps [for a dead corps might not rest in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> all night, and so he escaped and was brought to <hi>Caesar.</hi>] Thus <hi>R. Nathan</hi> tels the story, <hi>Avoth</hi> per. 4. This <hi>Rabban Iochanan</hi> fourty years ago, when the Temple doors flew open of their own accord, foresaw its ruine in that presage, and accordingly applied that saying of the Prophet <hi>Zechary, Open thy doors O Lebanon that the fire may devour thy Cedars.</hi> Therefore when he saw the enemy now so straitly besieging the City, and such forerunners of ruine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, it is no wonder if he used all perswasion to the people to yield and to save their City, as the same Author also tels us he did, and if he went and gave himself up to him that he knew should be Conquerour. Nor needed he any Prophetick spirit to foresee these things, but the very sickly condition and distemper of the Nation might plainly enough tell him, that her death could not be farre off.</p>
               <p>He finding favour with <hi>Caesar,</hi> petitioned of him, that the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to its old place <hi>Iabneh,</hi> and there settle, and he obtained it. <hi>Iabneh</hi> was near unto <hi>Ioppa</hi> upon the sea coast: there is mention of it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.6.

               <p>WHen <hi>Rabban Iochanan</hi> died, <hi>Rabban Gamaliel</hi> succeeded him in the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency seven years. He is commonly called by the Hebrew Writers <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>Rabban Gamaliel of Iabneh.</hi> But for the right stating of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidency there, two things are to be observed. The first is mentioned in <hi>Babyl. in Rosh hashanah</hi> fol. 31.1, 2. where all the flittings of the <hi>Sanhedrin</hi> are reckoned in the <hi>Gomara</hi> thus: <hi>From the room Gazith it flitted to the Taberna</hi> [in the mountain of the Temple] <hi>from the Taberna into Hierusalem, from Hierusalem to Iabneh, from Iabneh to Osha or Vsha, from Osha to Shepharaam, from Shepharaam to Beth Shaaraim, from Beth Shaaraim to Tsipporis, and from Tsipporis to Tiberias.</hi> Now the marginall Glosse teacheth us how to understand these removes. <hi>When the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident was in any of these places,</hi> saith it, <hi>the Sanhedrin was with him, and when he or his sonne w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nt to another place, it went after him. It was at Iabneh in the daies of Rabban Iochanan, at Vsha in the daies of Rabban Gamaliel, but they returned from Vsha to Iabneh again: but in the daies of Rabban Simeon his sonne it went back again [to Vsha.]</hi> So that the time that <hi>Rabban Gamaliel</hi> sate at <hi>Iabneh</hi> instantly upon <hi>Rabban Iochanans</hi> death, was not long, but he went to <hi>Vsha,</hi> and his time at <hi>Vsha</hi> was not long neither, but to <hi>Iabneh</hi> again. And as we are to observe thus about his time and place, so there is a second thing to be taken notice about him, and that is the mixture of his Presidency.</p>

                  <hi>Of placing R. Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ezer the sonne of Azariah in the Presidency. Tsemach David</hi> speaks it out thus: <hi>R. Eliezer ben Azariah was a Priest, and was exceeding rich: he was made President in the room of Rabban Gamaliel, but afterward they were joyned in the Presidency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether:</hi> which is still obscure enough; but the <hi>Ierusalem Gomarists</hi> give the full story in <hi>Taanith fol.</hi> 67. <hi>col.</hi> 4. in these words: <hi>A certain scholar came and asked R. Ioshua, What is evening prayer? He answered, A thing arbitrary. The same scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar came and asked Rabban Gamaliel, What is evening prayer? and he said, A boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den duty. He saith to him, But R. Ioshua saith it is a thing arbitrary. He saith to him, To morrow when I come into the Congregation, stand forth and ask this question: So the scholar did ask Rabban Gamaliel, What is evening prayer? He answered, A bounden duty. How then, saith the scholar, doth R. Ioshua say it is a thing arbitrary? Rabban Gamaliel saith to R. Ioshua, Art thou he that saith it is a thing arbitrary? He answered, No. He saies to him, Stand upon thy feet that they may bear witnesse against thee. R. Ioshua stood upon his feet, whilest Rabban sate and was expounding, so that all the Congregation repined at him</hi> [for making him to stand so.] <hi>And they said to R. Hotspith the Interpreter, Dismisse the people, and they said to R. Zinnun the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster say Begin, and they said all Begin, and stood upon their feet too. And they said to him</hi> [Rabban Gamaliel] <hi>Against whom hath not thy mischief passed continually? They went presently and made R. Eliezer ben Azaria President, who was but sixteen years old, but very grave. R.

How many benches of scholars were there sitting there then? R. Iacob bar Susi saith Fourscore besides the people that stood behind them. R. Iosi ben R. Bon saith Three hundred.

               <p>Whence their first tumultuating took its rise, is of some obscurity, only it may be resolved into Gods just judgement upon them to stirre to their own ruine.

that they committed in <hi>Cyrene, Egypt</hi> and <hi>Cyprus</hi> might be looked upon as a just judgement for his persecution of Christianity, if multitudes of Christians did not also perish in those slaughters, if <hi>Ben Coziba</hi> were ringleader in them: For <hi>Iustin Martyr,</hi> Apol. 2. saith, that <hi>Barchochebas brought Christians only to torture, unlesse they would deny Christ and blashheme him.</hi> And <hi>Euseb.</hi> in Chron. <hi>Chochebas the ringleader of the Iews, put to death with all exquisite torture those Christians that would not assist him against the Romanes.</hi> That is worth observing which is spoken by <hi>Ierus.

               </p>
               <p>In these times also [of <hi>Trajane</hi> I suppose] there was an Edict against the Jews Ordination upon pain of death to him that did Ordain, and him that was Ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ruine of the place where any Ordination should be. <hi>Talm. Bab. Avodah Zarah</hi> fol. 8.2.</p>
               <p>And from the time of these tumults forward that began to take place which is spoken in <hi>Ierus. Sanhed.</hi> fol. 24. col. 2. <hi>That in the daies of R.

               <head>§. IX. The posture and temper of the People.</head>
               <p>HAving taken this brief account of their Scholastick and Magistratick History, as also of some generall occurrences that befell the Nation in these times, let us a little observe the carriage and temper of the men, for the better discerning of the Lords dispensing in reference to them, as a people of his curse, rejection and abhorring. They themselves little thought it, but were yet as proud and self-confident of their being the only people of God as ever; and unlesse it were in their plague by <hi>Ben Coziba,</hi> a stander by, would hardly think they lay under those cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses that had been so oft and so terribly denounced against them: and it may yet appear the more strange, when we do consider the setled way of their Religion, in which they walked with as much confidence and security as ever. The Land full of Synagogues, these frequented every Sabbath, and the second and fifth daies of the week, their paying Tithes, observing purifyings, clean and unclean meats and drinks, and in a word, all their Rites, but what unseparably belonged to the Temple, in as setled a course as they had done before the Temple fell. But in this very thing was their misery and the vengeance upon them; and that which they accounted was their happinesse, and with which they sweetned their Captivity and desolation of their City, was that very thing that was their unhappinesse and undoing.</p>
               <p>A double badge of reprobation they visibly carried, though themselves could not see it, namely their doting upon their wretched Traditions, and their rancour and enmity against the Gospel, besides what other brands of a curse may be read upon them.</p>
               <p>He that reads their <hi>Talmuds</hi> may observe this mark of perdition upon them in every page, that the generations after the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> were more mad, if possible, after their foolish and wicked Rites and Traditions, that made faith and the Word of God of no effect, then the generations before had been. A man that reades there may stand amazed to see a people of a lost and languishing condition, yet building up of those toies and trifles an airy structure, as if they were building an everlasting Kingdom. It speaks a palpable blindnesse upon them, that they took so little advertisement by the fall of their City, of the fall of their carnall and beggerly Rites, that they set them up more zealously then ever before. Let any man observe who they are that make the greatest noise in the <hi>Talmuds,</hi> and they will see this plain: This mindes me of a fancy of the great women among them, a ridiculous way that they used for the remembrance and mourning for <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> namely by wearing a golden Crown upon their heads, wrought in the fashion of a City, they called it <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>The golden City:</hi> It is spoken of in <hi>Ierus. Shabb. fol.</hi> 7. <hi>col.</hi> 4. where they are disputing whether the women might go forth with this ornament upon their heads on the Sabbath: And there they tell that <hi>R. Akibah
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:59067:104"/>
made a golden City for his wife, and when Rabban Gamaliels saw it, she was envious at it:</hi> A pretty way of mourning by pride, and to carry <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in gold on their heads, when <hi>Ierusalem</hi> lies in ashes under their feet: Much like did they by their Ceremonies and Traditions, when at the ruine of the City they should by right have been all buried in ashes with it, they inhanced them and made them more high and gallant then ever before.</p>
               <p>It is needlesse to instance their derision and detestation of <hi>Christ</hi> and Christianity, their blasphemy against his blessed name, their hatred and mischievousnesse against the professors of it: their Writings proclaim their impiety, and when many of the ancient Fathers have been put to write against the Jews, it argues they were busie and stirring as farre as they might. They had continuall opposings among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, yet they all agreed like <hi>Simeon and Levi, brethren in evil,</hi> to oppose, vilifie and blaspheam the Gospel. Hardly one of the <hi>Grandees</hi> that we have named, but he had <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>his opposite,</hi> one or other that stood out in contestation of opinion with him: Nay they went sometimes to it by the ears, as <hi>R. Eliezer</hi> and <hi>R. Iosi</hi> are so strugling together that they rent the Book of the Law betwixt them. <hi>Ierus. Shekalim</hi> fol. 47. col. 1. and as we observed before, the <hi>Shammaeans</hi> and <hi>Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelians</hi> fought it to blood and death: <hi>Rabban Gamaliel at Iabneh,</hi> deposed <hi>R. Aki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah</hi> from his Rectorship at <hi>Lydda.</hi> Rosh hashan. fol. 57. col. 1. And divers such bickerings which still ended in an unanimous consent to oppose Christianity as much as possible.</p>
               <p>We spake before of the commonnesse of <hi>Magick</hi> amongst them, one singular means whereby they kept their own in delusion, and whereby they affronted ours. The generall expectation of the Nation of <hi>Messias</hi> coming when he did, had this double and contrary effect; That it forwarded those that belonged to God, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and receive the Gospel: and those that did not, it gave incouragement to some to take upon them they were <hi>Christ</hi> or some great Prophet, and to others it gave some perswasion to be deluded by them. These deceivers dealt most of them with Magick, and that cheat ended not when <hi>Ierusalem</hi> ended, though one would have thought that had been a fair term of not further expecting <hi>Messias,</hi> but since the people were willing still to be deceived by such expectation, there rose up de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luders still that were willing to deceive them. The <hi>Ierusalem Talmud</hi> will furnish us with variety of examples in this kinde, and I cite it the oftner because it was made among these men we are speaking of, the Jews in <hi>Iudaea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To begin with dreamers and interpreters of dreams, which was a degree of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lusion with them. In <hi>Maasar Sheni fol.</hi> 45. <hi>col.</hi> 2, 3. there is mention of <hi>Rabbi Iosi ben Chalpatha,</hi> of this trade, and <hi>R. Ismael ben Rabbi Iosi,</hi> and <hi>R. Lazar,</hi> and <hi>R. Akibah</hi>; and there are many dreams recorded that they interpreted: and it seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by a passage in the place, that they taught their Scholars this trick as a piece of their learning: And finding of <hi>R. Akibah</hi> in this catalogue, we cannot but think how well <hi>Ben Coziba</hi> and he were met: for if the one were a cheater in one kinde, the other was a deceiver in another. If that of the Apostle <hi>Iude</hi> in his Epistle, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>These filthy dreamers</hi>; should be construed in this literall sense, it would finde enow in those times to make it good.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Shabb. fol.</hi> 3. <hi>col.</hi> 2. it speaks of an apparition to one of their religious men that was studying the Law.</p>
               <p>Ibid. <hi>fol.</hi> 8. <hi>col.</hi> 2, 3. and <hi>fol.</hi> 14.3. there is mention of severall charmings, as read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing some verses over a wound, laying the Book of the Law or Phylacteries upon a sick person, charming against serpents and an evil eye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And now we are speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>an evil eye,</hi> or witchery, we may take in that <hi>Sanhedr.</hi> fol. 18. col. 3. <hi>Four and twenty of the School of Rabbi Iudah came to Lydda to intercalate the year, and an evil eye came in among them and they all died.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>And to conclude all, the many stories they have of <hi>Bath kol</hi> or a voice from heaven [most commonly coming for the magnifying of some of their Doctors, as see, <hi>Sotah fol.</hi> 24. <hi>col.</hi> 2.] are either forgeries, or if there were any such seeming voices, they were forged upon the anvile of Magick: How can a Nation but carry the visible mark of perdition, when vain traditions are their standing Religion, and Magick and Inchantments a common practise?</p>
               <p>To this kinde of legerdemain, we may adde another, not altogether indeed of so deep a die, yet that which came from the same father, and that was, the loud legends they invented of their great Rabbines, thereby to awe the people to the reverence of their Persons, Memories and Doctrines: and of others devoutly zealous in their doting Religion, of whom they tell strange wonders for the magnifying of it. I shall name none for shame: these are they that do most disgrace their Writings, and make them most ridiculous.</p>
               <p>A last thing to be named that they did toward the intayling folly, unbelief and obduration upon their Nation to all posterity, is their ingaging them to their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons and Traditions, as they delivered them: especially to the <hi>Mishnah</hi> when <hi>Rabbi Iudah</hi> had published it, and to the two <hi>Talmuds</hi> when they came forth, especially the <hi>Babylonian,</hi> which stands as a Standard to all the Nation for her Rule and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion to this day: they being generally <hi>Pharisaicall,</hi> and scarce a <hi>Karaite</hi> that we hear of amongst them.</p>

               <head>§. X. How farre these Iews in the first generation of Christianity might infect or infest it.</head>
               <p>WE need not speak of their crossing the Gospel, and persecuting and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieving the professors of it, when it lay in their power; that needs no clearing: A twofold infection, more especially, they diffused into the Christian Church, which tainted many, and where it caught proved pestilentiall enough, even that which was the least dangerous: and these were, that out of this sink rose the desperate heresies of the first ages of the Gospel, and from these men came the Allegorizing of the Scriptures, which was but one degree lesse profitable, if not lesse deadly then their traditions.</p>
               <p>How damnable Heresies arose from among them in the Apostles times, we have seen copiously as we have come along through the Epistles, some unbeleeving Jews and some Apostates diffusing poyson so deadly and so affluent, that it undid mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes by backsliding. The venom was of a contrary malignity, yet both extreams met alike in this point, that they proved most deadly. The unbeleeving Jews stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the strictnesse of the Law, perverted divers to turn from the Gospel, to the precise course of their Judaism to seek Justification by works. And the Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, as farre misjudging of the liberty of the Gospel, introduced all manner of licentiousnesse and heedlesnesse of their waies, as to eat things sacrificed to Idols, and to commit fornication. These were the most notorious, as striking directly at the root of Justification by faith, and of holinesse of life: but these were not all, but other roots of gall and wormwood growing upon the same soil, as denying of the resurrection altogether, as did the <hi>Sadduces,</hi> or denying the Resurrection of those that started from Judaism, and worshipping of Angels, and whatsoever else, the Apostles speak of this gangrean in their Epistles, which though they grew and were at full ripenesse before <hi>Ierusalem</hi> fell, yet did they fade but little when she was down.</p>
               <p>As the first wretched stock of Hereticks that rose, <hi>Simon, Cerinthus, Menander, Ebion, Basilides,</hi> &amp;c. appeared either in <hi>Iudaea,</hi> or at least there where there were multitudes of Jews, as <hi>Basilides</hi> at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> so the most of those damnable opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that they sowed, and which grew for a long while after, had some root or other in Judaism, or received some cursed moisture from thence to nourish them.

                  <hi>Iudaism</hi> I here understand the body of the Jews Religions, though differing within it self, yet all contrary to Christianity. Look upon <hi>Palestine,</hi> and you have it thus stocked in the times that we are upon. 1.

And when they waned there, then did they flourish in their three Universities in <hi>Babylonia:</hi> and the succession of the Schools and names of their Learned men known there, not only till the signing of the <hi>Babylon Talmud</hi> which was about the year of <hi>Christ</hi> 500, but even till the other part of <hi>the mystery of iniquity the Papal Antichrist</hi> arose at <hi>Babylon</hi> in the West: And as these two parts make one intire body of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and as the later took at the first to do the work that they had done, to deface the truth and oppose it, and that under the colour of Religion, so did it in great measure take his Pandect of Errors from these his predecessors. Traditions, false Miracles, Legends, Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, Merit, Purgatory, implicit faith, and divers other things so derived from this source, as if left by legacy from the one to the other.</p>
               <p>A second taint we mentioned that these Primitive Jews set, not only upon their own posterity, but too much also upon the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> was the turning of the Scriptures all into Allegory: which as it is well known how it was used by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Fathers to their great losse of time, and little profiting of the Church: so is it easily to be known from whence it comes, by any that reades <hi>Philo Iudaeus,</hi> and the Jewish <hi>Derushim.</hi> The <hi>Talmuds</hi> indeed are for the most part, upon disputes, but sometimes they bring in how such or such a Doctor did <hi>Darash,</hi> [mystically expound] such or such a place of Scripture: and then you have directly such stuff as this. <hi>Philo</hi> in his discourse concerning the <hi>Therapeutae</hi> or <hi>Esseans,</hi> relateth that they had used this mysticall kinde of exposition of old.

               <p n="3">3. In every Synagogue they had a true Copy: And it was their care every where to have their Bible as purely authentick as possible, as may be seen by the curious rules that are given to that purpose in <hi>Massecheth Sophorim</hi> newly cited, and <hi>Megillah.</hi> For this they accounted their treasure and their glory: And in the reading of the Law and the Prophets in the Synagogue, it was their great care that not a tittle should be read amisse: and for this purpose the Minister stood over those that read, and oversaw that they read aright: and from this, as <hi>Aruch</hi> tels us, he was called <hi>Chazan,</hi> that is <hi>Episcopus</hi> or <hi>Overseer:</hi> In <hi>Ierus. Sotah fol.</hi> 21. <hi>col.</hi> 3. the <hi>Samaritans</hi> are blamed by the Jews for wilfully corrupting their own Penteteuch. <hi>R. Eliezer ben R. Simeon said, I said to the Scribes of the Samaritans, You have falsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied your Law, and yet reap no advantage by it: for you have written in your Law,</hi> By the plain of <hi>Moreh</hi> which is <hi>Sichem; And was it not manifest enough without that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that it was Sichem? But you construe not,</hi> a pari, <hi>as we do. It is said here,</hi> The plain of <hi>Moreh, and it is said elsewhere,</hi> The plain of <hi>Moreh: there it is no other but Sichem: no more must it be here.</hi> [The addition cavilled at, <hi>which is Sichem,</hi> is so in the <hi>Samaritan Penteteuch</hi> now extant, at <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.30.] But amongst all the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse that <hi>Christ</hi> and his Apostles laid to the charge of the Jews, yet you never finde them blamed in the least degree for this, that they went about to corrupt the letter of the Text: The sense indeed they spoiled with their glosses, and so made the Word of God of no effect, and this they hear of throughly, but not a word of their spoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the letter of the Text.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Had they been never so desirous to have imposed upon <hi>Christians,</hi> by falsifying the Text, they could not possibly do it: for 1. Every Synagogue in the world ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the purest Copy that possibly was to be got, how impossible was it such <hi>legerde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi> should be, when there were so many thousand Copies to discover it [unlesse they were all corrupt alike] and multitudes out of the Synagogues, Rulers and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were converted to the Gospel. 2. As learned men as any they had among them, and that as well understood what Text was pure, what corrupt, <hi>Ioseph of Arl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mathea, Nicodemus, Paul,</hi> and multitudes of the Priests imbraced the Gospel: and so multitudes of pure Copies were in the hands of <hi>Christians,</hi> upon the first rising of the Gospel, and multitudes that had such Copies in their hands were converted daily.</p>
               <p n="5">5. To which may be added that the same power and care of God that preserves the Church, would preserve the Scriptures pure to it: and he that did and could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve the whole, could preserve every part, so that not so much as a tittle should perish.</p>

               <p>BY what hath been spoken concerning the state of the Jews in their own Land after the fall of their City, it may be observed wherein it is that the Lords ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance upon that Nation doth especially consist, namely in his rejection of them
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:59067:108"/>
from being his people, and in their obduration. The unspeakable miseries and slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that they indured in the siege and ruine of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> speak as dreadfull punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as ever fell upon a Nation, and yet this was but short and small, in comparison of that fearfull blindnesse and hardnesse that lies upon them, and hath done for this sixteen hundred years together. Seventy years in bodily bondage in <hi>Babel,</hi> did finish the punishment of their forefathers, for all the Idolatry, bloodshed and impiety that they had committed: But these after above twenty times seventy years, under di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersion and obduration, have now as little appearance of amendment of their hearts and of their condition, as there was so many hundred years ago. The same blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, the same doting upon traditions, the same insisting upon their own works for salvation, the same blind confidence that they are Gods only beloved people, the same expectation of <hi>Messias</hi> to come, the same hatred of <hi>Messias</hi> already come, and the same opposition against the Gospel is in them still, that was in that first generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that crucified the Lord of life. That generation is plainly and often asserted by the holy Ghost in the New Testament to be <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and the very same <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian</hi> spirit hath continued in all the generations of them, ever since, even to this day.</p>
               <p>Into the thoughts therefore concerning their Calling after so long and so extream crosness against the Gospel and the Lord of it, I cannot but take these things into consideration. [For though I am unwilling to recede from that charitable opinion of most Christians that there shall once be a Calling of them home, yet see I not how that supposall of the universall Call of the whole Nation, as of one man, which some entertain, can be digested without some allay and mitigation.] 1. That all <hi>Israel,</hi> both Jews and they of the ten Tribes, have had as full an offer of the Gospel as any of the Gentiles have had, both in the time of the Apostles and since. Of the two Tribes there can be no scruple: and of the ten, almost as little, if their sin that cast them off the place of their seating when carried out of their own Land, and the carriage of the Gospel through the whole world, be well considered: Now that their refusing of the Gospel so offered to them, in that manner as they have done, should be followed with so universall a Call and Conversion, is somewhat hard to beleeve: especially when it is observed that the Gentiles despising the Gospel are doomed to the everlasting deprivation of it, and to a worse condition then <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Zidon.</hi> 2. It is true indeed that Gods Covenant with their fathers, is of speciall weight and observation in this business, and the Apostle toucheth it in this question, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.28. but how is this to be understood? God made a twofold Covenant with their fathers, <hi>viz.</hi> the Covenant of grace, and the Covenant of peculiarity; and the later was but a manner of the administration of the former. The Covenant of grace was made with <hi>Adam,</hi> and belongs to all the seed of <hi>Christ,</hi> before the Law, under it, and after it, Jews and Gentiles. Now the Oeconomy of <hi>Moses</hi> was such an administration of this Covenant of grace as made <hi>Israel</hi> a peculiar people. This effect of the Covenant with their fathers, namely that they still are and ever shall be Gods peculiar, is their conceit all along, but little warrant for us to hold it, since under the Gospel there is no distinction of Jew and Gentile: And as for the other, that many of them yet belong to Election and the Covenant of grace made with their fathers, it is not to be doubted, which yet doth little make for so generall a calling. 3. It was a good sign of the generall conversion of the Heathen once to be, in that there were mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of them proselyted daily, before the generall Call by the Gospel came [an hundred three and fifty thousand in the daies of <hi>Solomon,</hi> and that when Religion was then in a very narrow compass:] But of these, how few, in comparison have come in, in all this long time, though they have had incomparably more means and opportunity then ever those had? Their sin that cast them off, was more horrid then the sin that cast off the Heathen, and so their blindness and obduration is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond theirs. And which deserves observation, The sin of the two Tribes was beyond the sin of the ten. 4. Since the new Testament doth ordinarily stile that first gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration <hi>Antichrist:</hi> and since, as is apparent, the very same spirit is in the Nation to this day, I see not how we can look upon the conversion of the Jews under a lower notion then the conversion of a brood of <hi>Antichrist.</hi> Therefore can I no more look for the generall calling of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>m, then I look for the generall call of the <hi>Antichristian</hi>

So can I not but conceive of the Jewish Nation, That although numerous multitudes of them may at the last be brought into the Gospel as the Protestant par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath been, yet that to the end numerous multitudes also shall commo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tichristian spirit of unbelief and opposition and blaspheming: and both parts of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist, the <hi>Roman</hi> and this so to perish together. Nor doth this opinion any whit crosse any place of Scripture that is produced about the calling of the Jews, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther settle its sense and explain it: That eminent place of the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth such a limitation throughout: and the very intent of his discourse speaketh to such a tenour all along: For his drift in that Chapter is not to determine whether all the Jews should be once called, but whether all the Jews were wholly cast off: and this he states that <hi>there is a remnant,</hi> ver. 5. that <hi>the election hath obtained, but the rest are blinded,</hi> v. 7. and that <hi>blindness in part is happened to Israel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>v.</hi> 25. And this is the mystery that he there speaketh of, and not as some would wrest it, their universal conversion. A mystery indeed that God should cast off his old Covenanted people, and that they that had alwaies had the light, and only seen of all the Nations of the world, should now sit in darkness and be blind, and that the Gentiles by their blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness should come to see. It is remarkable in this place and others of the Apostles Epistles, that though the destruction of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> were the most signall time, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of Gods casting them off, yet that they were indeed cast off long before: as, to spare more allegations, may be observed in the first Epistle to the <hi>Thessalonians, Ch.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 15, 16. which was the first Epistle that the Apostle wrote. Whence punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to date their rejection, whether from the death of <hi>Christ,</hi> or from the first send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gospel among the Gentiles, is not much materiall to inquire after here: it is enough for our present purpose, to observe, that they are given for cast off so early in the dispersion of the Gospel: So that the Apostle doth clearly include their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version even at that first spreading of the Gospel, as well as their conversion in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture times. He saith, <hi>their casting off was the riches of the Gentiles, and the reconciling of the world,</hi> and their fulness should much more inrich the Gentiles, and be as life from the dead: By their <hi>fulness</hi> not meaning the whole number of their Nation, but the full number of Gods Elect of them when they should be brought in. The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting off of the Nation inriched the Gentiles, in that they came in to be the Lords people in their stead, but much more shall it be an inriching to them when the full number of them that belong to God shall come in also and be joyned to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and help to make their body up. This is apparently the drift of the Apostle in those words, which that opinion is exceedingly wide of, that holds that the calling of the Jews shall not be till the fulness of the Gentiles be come in. It is true indeed that he saith, that <hi>blindness in part is happened to Israel till that time,</hi> v. 25. and so our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our saith that <hi>Ierusalem shall be troden down of the Gentiles untill the time of the Gentile<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As we need not to go far for instance, that very place of the Apostle that is under our hands, doth hold out all along that the Gentiles and the Jews that belong to the election of grace, do make up but one Body. And that very passage that is chiefly pleaded for their universal Call, <hi>And so all Israel shall be saved,</hi> means no other. Therefore though it may be hoped that God hath multitudes of them yet to be brought in, from under their Antichristian dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and opp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
