            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN about <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> laſt I waited on you with my print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Letter to the Author of a Book, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>Some Diſcourſes upon Dr.</hi> Burnet (now Lord Biſhop of <hi>Salisbury) and Dr.</hi> Tillotſon (late Lord Arch-Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Canterbury) occaſioned by the late Funeral-Sermon of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer upon the latter:</hi> After I had paid my Duty and Service to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, you were pleaſed to take me by the Hand, and would not let me go, till I had promiſed you to publiſh to the World this following Narrative of and concerning <hi>Ann Jefferies,</hi> which I had told you about <hi>15</hi> or <hi>20</hi> Years ago, one Lord's-day at Dinner, where was alſo Mr. <hi>Will. Tom,</hi> ſometime ſince Mayor
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:50283:3"/>
of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and at this time living there, (and is Son of the Gentlewoman of that Name mentioned in this Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive) who did aver the Truth of many, if not all the Paſſages I here relate, and will alſo ſtill juſtify the ſame. I doubt not but I could bring ſeveral other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons now living to juſtify the Truth of what I here writ: Nay, ſhe her ſelf, who is at this time living in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> muſt own it, and a great deal more, if ſhe could be prevailed with to ſpeak out. My Lord, I thought I could, if any Perſon alive, have prevail'd with her, ſhe being the Servant that attended me in my Childhood; but your Lordſhip may ſee that I cannot, and therefore your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip muſt be content with what I here publiſh: And altho I was then but a Child, yet I am ſatisfied I was not, nor could not be impoſed on in this Affair, they having made ſo great am Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:50283:3"/>
on me from my Childhood hitherto. I know, my Lord, that the great Part of the World will not believe the Paſſages here related, by reaſon of the Strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them, but I cannot help their Unbelief: Your Lordſhip knows the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord where it's mentioned, <hi>That the Great God did marvelous things in the ſight of our Forefathers, but for all that they ſinned yet more, and believed not his wonderous Works:</hi> And therefore Unbelief is no new Sin crept into the World. And moreover, my Lord, if Men would give themſelves time to think, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but remember that the Great God has done as great and marvelous Works in our Age, both in Judgment and in Mercy, as he did in the days of old: By which the greateſt Atheiſt may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd, not only of the Being of a God, but alſo that his Power and his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:50283:4"/>
are as manifeſt now as of old; and therefore it's the Duty of all that do by perſonal Knowledg know any extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Works or Providences of God, which are uncommon, to publiſh them to the World, that the Great God may be glorified, and Mankind edified; which is purely and truly the Deſign of publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the following Narrative.</p>

               <hi>ANN Jefferies,</hi> (for that was her Maiden Named) of whom the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſtrange things are related, was born in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Teath</hi> in the County of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> in <hi>December,</hi> 1626. and ſhe is ſtill living, 1696. being now in the 70th Year of her Age; ſhe is married to one <hi>William Warden,</hi> formerly Hind (a Hind is one that looks after the reſt of the Servants, the Grounds, Cattel, Corn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter) to the late eminent Phyſician Dr. <hi>Richard Lower</hi> deceaſed; and now lives as Hind to Sir <hi>Andrew Slanning</hi> of <hi>Devon,</hi> Bar.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:50283:5"/>I muſt acquaint you, Sir, that I have made it my Buſineſs, but could not prevail, to get a Relation from her of what ſhe her ſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members of thoſe ſeveral ſtrange Paſſages of her Life that I here relate, or of any other that I have either forgot, or that never came to my Cognizance: but ſhe being prevail'd with by ſome of her poor ignorant Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours not to do it, and ſhe fancying that if ſhe ſhould do it, ſhe might again fall into Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble about it; I here give your Lordſhip the beſt and faithfulleſt Account I can.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1691. I wrote into <hi>Cornwall</hi> to my Siſter <hi>Mary Martyn</hi>'s Son, an Attorney, to go to the ſaid <hi>Ann,</hi> and diſcourſe her as from me, about the moſt material ſtrange Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of her Life: He anſwers my Letter, <hi>Sept.</hi> 13, 1691. and ſaith, <hi>I have been with</hi> Ann Jefferies, <hi>and ſhe can give me no particular Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her Condition, it being ſo long ſince: my Grandfather and Mother ſay, that ſhe was in</hi> Bodmyn <hi>Goal three Months, and lived ſix Months without Meat; and during her Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in that Condition, ſeveral eminent Cures were performed by her, the Particulars no one can now relate. My Mother ſaw the</hi> Fairies <hi>once, and heard one ſay, that they ſhould give ſome Meat to the Child, that ſhe might return to her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: Which is the fulleſt Relation can now be given.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I not being ſatisfied with this Anſwer, did, in the Year 1693. write into <hi>Cornwall</hi> to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:50283:5"/>
my Siſter's Husband, (Mr. <hi>Humph. Martyn)</hi> and deſired him to go to <hi>Ann Jefferies,</hi> to ſee if he could perſwade her to give me what Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſhe could remember of the many and ſtrange Paſſages of her Life. He anſwers my Letter, <hi>Jan.</hi> 31, 1693. and ſaith, <hi>As for</hi> Ann Jefferies, <hi>I have been with her the greateſt part of one day, and did read to her all that you wrote to me; but ſhe would not own any thing of it as concerning the</hi> Fairies, <hi>neither of any of the Cures ſhe then did. I endeavoured to perſwade her ſhe might receive ſome Benefit by it: She anſwered; That if her own Father were now alive, ſhe would not diſcover to him thoſe things that did then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to her. I ask'd her the Reaſon why ſhe would not do it: She reply'd, That if ſhe ſhould diſcover it to you, that you would make either Books or Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads of it: And ſhe ſaid, That ſhe would not have her Name ſpread about the Country in Books or Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lads of ſuch things, if ſhe might have five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Pounds for the doing of it: for ſhe ſaid, ſhe had been queſtioned before Juſtices, and at the Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and in Priſon, and alſo before the Judges at the Aſſizes; and ſhe doth believe, that if ſhe ſhould diſcover ſuch things now, ſhe ſhould be que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned again for it. As for the antient Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of St.</hi> Teath <hi>Church Town, there are none of them now alive but</hi> Thomas Chriſtopher <hi>a blind Man,</hi> (Note, this <hi>Tho. Chriſtopher</hi> was then a Servant in my Father's Houſe when theſe things happened) <hi>and he remembers many of the Paſſages you wrote of her. And as for my Wife,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:50283:6"/>
ſhe then being ſo little, did not mind it; but has heard her Father and Mother relate moſt of the Paſſages you wrote of her.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is all the Account I can at preſent poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly get from her, and therefore I now go on with my own Relation of the wonderful Cures, and other ſtrange things ſhe did, or hapned to her, which is the Subſtance of what I wrote to my Brother, and that he read to her.</p>
            <p>It's the Cuſtom in our County of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> for the moſt ſubſtantial People of each Pariſh to take Apprentices the Poor's Children, and to breed them up till they attain to 21 Years of Age, and for their Service to give them Meat, Drink, and Clothes. This <hi>Ann Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feries</hi> being a poor Man's Child of the Pariſh, by Providence fell into our Family, where ſhe lived ſeveral Years, being a Girl of a bold daring Spirit: She would venture at thoſe Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and Dangers that no Boy would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1645, (ſhe then being 19 Years old) ſhe being one day knitting in an Arbour in our Garden, there came over the Garden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hedg to her ſix Perſons of a ſmall Stature, all clothed in green, which ſhe call'd <hi>Fairies:</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which ſhe was ſo frighted, that ſhe fell into a kind of a Convulſion-fit: But when we found her in this Condition, we brought her into the Houſe, and put her to bed, and took
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:50283:6"/>
great Care of her. As ſoon as ſhe recovered out of her Fit, ſhe cries out, <hi>They are juſt gone out of the Window; they are juſt gone out of the Window; do you not ſee them?</hi> And thus in the height of her Sickneſs ſhe would often cry out, and that with Eagerneſs; which Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions we attributed to her Diſtemper, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing her light-headed. During the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of her Sickneſs my Father's Mother died, which was in <hi>April,</hi> 1646. but we durſt not acquaint our Maid <hi>Ann</hi> with it, for fear it might have increas'd her Diſtemper, ſhe being at that time ſo very ſick that ſhe could not go, nor ſo much as ſtand on her Feet; and alſo the Extremity of her Sickneſs, and the long Continuance of her Diſtemper, had almoſt perfectly moped her, ſo that ſhe became even as a Changeling: and as ſoon as ſhe began to recover, and to get a little Strength, ſhe in her going would ſpread her Legs as wide as ſhe could, and ſo lay hold with her Hands on Tables, Forms, Chairs, Stools, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> till ſhe had learn'd to go again: and if any thing vex'd her, ſhe would fall into her Fits, and continue in them a long time; ſo that we were afraid ſhe would have died in one of them. As ſoon as ſhe had got out of her Fit, ſhe would heartily call upon God: and then the firſt Perſon ſhe would ask for was her Child, meaning my ſelf, (becauſe ſhe before her Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs tended me) and would not be ſatisfied till I came to her. Upon which ſhe would ask
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:50283:7"/>
me, if any one had vex'd or abus'd me ſince ſhe fell into her Fit. Upon my telling her, no one had, ſhe would ſtroke me, and kiſs me, calling me her dear Chi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d; and then all her Vexation was over.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as ſhe recovered a little Strength, ſhe conſtantly went to Church to pay her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions to our great and good God, and to hear his Word read and preached. Her Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory was ſo well reſtored to her, that ſhe would repeat more of the Sermons ſhe heard than any other of our Family. She took mighty Delight in Devotion, and in hearing the Word of God read and preach'd, altho ſhe her ſelf could not read.</p>
            <p>The firſt manual Operation or Cure ſhe perform'd, was on my own Mother; the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion was as follows: One Afternoon, in the Harveſt-time, all our Family being in the Fields at work, (and my ſelf a Child at School) there was none in the Houſe but my Mother and this <hi>Ann:</hi> my Mother conſidering that Bread might be wanting for the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, if Care were not taken; and ſhe having before caus'd two Buſhels of Wheat to be ſent to the Mill to be ground, (note, our Buſhel is twenty Gallons) my Mother was reſolved that ſhe her ſelf would take a Walk to the Mill, (which was but a quarter of a Mile from our Houſe) to haſten the Miller to bring home the Meal, that ſo her Maids, as

ſoon as they came from the Fields, might make and bake the Bread; but in the mean time how to diſpoſe of her Maid <hi>Ann,</hi> was her great Care, for ſhe did not dare truſt her in the Houſe alone, for fear ſhe might do her ſelf ſome Miſchief by Fire, or ſet the Houſe on fire (for at that time ſhe was ſo weak that ſhe could hardly help her ſelf, and every ſilly withal): At laſt by much Perſwaſions my Mother prevail'd with her to walk in the Gardens and Orchards till ſhe came from the Mill; to which ſhe unwillingly conſented. Then my Mother lock'd the Doors of the Houſe, and walk'd to the Mill; but as ſhe was coming home in a very plain way, ſhe ſlipt and hurt her Leg, ſo as that ſhe could not riſe, there ſhe lay a conſiderable time in great Pain, till a Neighbour coming by on Horſeback, ſeeing my Mother in this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, lifted her up on his Horſe, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her home. As ſoon as ſhe was brought within the Doors of the Houſe, word of it was ſent into the Fields to the Reapers, who thereupon immediately left their Harveſt-work, and came home; the Houſe being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently full of People: a Man-ſervant was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to take a Horſe and ride for Mr. <hi>Lob</hi> an eminent Chyrurgeon, that then liv'd at a Market-Town call'd <hi>Bodmyn,</hi> which was eight Miles from my Father's Houſe: but whilſt the Man was getting the Horſe ready, in comes our Maid <hi>Ann,</hi> and tells my Mother
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:50283:8"/>
ſhe was heartily ſorry for the Miſchance ſhe had got in hurting of her Leg, and that ſhe did it at ſuch a Place (naming the Place); and further, ſhe deſir'd ſhe might ſee her Leg: My Mother at firſt refuſed to ſhew her her Leg, ſaying to her, what ſhould ſhe ſhew her Leg to ſo poor and ſilly a Creature as ſhe was? for ſhe could do her no good: but <hi>Ann</hi> being very importunate with my Mother to ſee her Leg, and my Mother being unwilling to vex her by denying her, for fear of her falling into her Fits, (for at all times we dealt gently, lovingly, and kindly, with her, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great Care by no means to croſs or fret her) did yield to her Requeſt, and did ſhew her, her Leg: Upon which <hi>Ann</hi> took my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Leg on her Lap, and ſtrok'd it with her Hand, and then ask'd my Mother if ſhe did not find Eaſe by her ſtroking of it. My Mother confeſs'd to her ſhe did. Upon this ſhe deſired my Mother to forbear ſending for the Chyrurgeon, for ſhe would, by the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, cure her Leg: and to ſatisfy my Mother of the Truth of it, ſhe again ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd to my Mother, whether ſhe did not find farther Eaſe upon her continued ſtroking of the Part affected; which my Mother again acknowledged ſhe did. Upon this my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther countermanded the Meſſenger for the Chyrurgeon.</p>
            <p>On this my Mother demanded of her how ſhe came to the Knowledg of her Fall. She
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:50283:8"/>
made anſwer, that <hi>half a dozen Perſons told her of it.</hi> That, reply'd my Mother, could not be, for there was none came by at that time, but my Neighbour . . . . that brought me home. <hi>Ann</hi> anſwers again, that that was Truth, and it was alſo true, that <hi>half a dozen Perſons told her ſo;</hi> for ſaid ſhe, you know I went out of the Houſe into the Gardens and Orchards very unwillingly. And now I will tell you the Truth of all Matters and Things that have befallen me.</p>
            <p>You know that this my Sickneſs and Fits came very ſuddenly upon me, which brought me very low and weak, and have made me very ſimple. Now the Cauſe of my Sickneſs was this.</p>
            <p>I was one day knitting of Stockings in the Arbour in the Garden, and there came over the Garden-hedg of a ſudden <hi>ſix ſmall People,</hi> all in green Clothes, which put me into ſuch a Fright and Conſternation that was the Cauſe of this my great Sickneſs; and they continue their Appearance to me, never leſs than 2 at a time, nor never more than 8: they always appear in even Numbers, 2, 4, 6, 8. When I ſaid often in my Sickneſs, <hi>They were juſt gone out of the Window,</hi> it was really ſo; altho you thought me light-headed. At this time when I came out into the Garden, they came to me, and ask'd me, if you had put me out of the Houſe againſt my Will: I told them I was unwilling to come out of the Houſe: Upon this they ſaid, you ſhould not fare the
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:50283:9"/>
better for it; and thereupon in that Place, and at that time, in a fair Path-way you fell, and hurt your Leg. I would not have you ſend for a Chyrurgeon, nor trouble your ſelf, for I will cure your Leg: The which ſhe did in a little time.</p>
            <p>This cure of my Mother's Leg and the Stories ſhe told of theſe <hi>Fairies,</hi> made ſuch a Noiſe over all the County of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> as that it had the ſame Effect St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s healing of <hi>Publius</hi>'s Father of a Fever and a bloody Flux, at <hi>Malta,</hi> after his Shipwrack there, as related <hi>Acts</hi> 28.8, 9, <hi>And it came to paſs that the Father of</hi> Publius <hi>lay ſick of a Favor, and of a bloody Flux: to whom</hi> Paul <hi>entred in, and prayed, and laid his Hands on him, and healed him. So when this was done, others alſo which had Diſeaſes in the Iſland, came, and were healed.</hi> That People of all Diſtempers, Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, Sores, and Ages, came not only ſo far off as the Lands-end, but alſo from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and were cured by her. She took no Monies of them, nor any Reward that ever I knew or heard of; yet had ſhe Monies at all times ſufficient to ſupply her Wants. She neither made nor bought any Medicines or Salves that ever I ſaw or heard of, yet wanted them not as ſhe had Occaſion. She forſook eating our Victuals, and was fed by theſe <hi>Fairies</hi> from that Harveſt-time to the next <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>-day; upon which Day ſhe came to our Table, and ſaid, becauſe it
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:50283:9"/>
was that Day ſhe would eat ſome Roaſt Beef with us, the which ſhe did, I my ſelf being then at table.</p>
            <p>One time (I remember it perfectly well) I had a mind to ſpeak with her, and not knowing better where to find her than in her Chamber, I went thither, and fell a knocking very earneſtly at her Chamber-door with my Foot, and calling to her ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, <hi>Ann, Ann, open the Door, and let me in:</hi> She anſwered me, <hi>My Child, have a little Patience, and I will let you in immediately.</hi> Upon which I look'd through the Key-hole of the Door, and I ſaw her eating; and when ſhe had done eating, ſhe ſtood ſtill by her Bed-ſide as long as Thanks to God might be given, and then ſhe made a Courſey, (or Bow) and opened the Chamber-door, and gave me a Piece of her Bread, which I did eat, but I think it was the moſt delicious Bread that ever I did eat either before or ſince.</p>
            <p>Another odd Paſſage which I muſt relate, was this; One Lord's day my Father with his Family being at Dinner in our Hall, comes in one of our Neighbours, whoſe Name was <hi>Francis Heathman,</hi> and ask'd where <hi>Ann</hi> was; we told him ſhe was in her Chamber: Upon this he goes into her Chamber to ſee for her; and not ſeeing her; he calls her: She not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, he feels up and down in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for her; but not finding her, comes and tells us ſhe was not in her Chamber. As ſoon
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:50283:10"/>
as he had ſaid this, ſhe comes out of her Chamber to us, as we were ſitting at Table, and tells him, ſhe was in her Chamber, and ſaw him, and heard him call her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſee him feel up and down the Chamber for her<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and had almoſt felt her, but he could not ſee her altho ſhe ſaw him, notwithſtanding ſhe was at the ſame time at the Table in her Chamber eating her Dinner.</p>
            <p>One Day theſe <hi>Fairies</hi> gave my Siſter <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> (the now Wife of Mr. <hi>Humph. Martyn)</hi> then about four Years of Age, a Silver Cup that held about a Quart, bidding her give it my Mother, and ſhe did bring it my Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but my Mother would not accept of it, but bid her carry it to them again, which ſhe did. I preſume this was the time my Siſter owns ſhe ſaw the <hi>Fairies.</hi> I confeſs to your Lordſhip, I never did ſee them. I had almoſt forgot to tell your Lordſhip, that <hi>Ann</hi> would tell what People would come to her ſeveral Days before they came, and from whence, and at what time they would come.</p>
            <p>I have ſeen <hi>Ann</hi> in the Orchard dancing among the Trees; and ſhe told me, ſhe was then dancing with the <hi>Fairies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great Noiſe of the many ſtrange Cures <hi>Ann</hi> did, and alſo her living without eating our Victuals, (ſhe being fed by theſe <hi>Fairies)</hi> caus'd both the Neighbour-Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and Miniſters to reſort to my Father's
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:50283:10"/>
Houſe, and talk with her, and ſtrictly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined her about the Matters here related; and ſhe gave them very rational Anſwers to all thoſe Queſtions they then ask'd her, (for by this time ſhe was well recovered out of her Sickneſs and Fits, and her natural Parts and Underſtanding much improv'd) my Father and all his Family affirming the Truth of all we ſaw. The <hi>Miniſters</hi> endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade her they were evil Spirits that reſorted to her, and that it was the Deluſion of the Devil, (but how could that be, when ſhe did no Hurt, but Good to all that came to her for Cure of their Diſtempers?) and adviſed her not to go to them when they call'd her. Upon theſe Admonitions of the Miniſters and Magiſtrates, our <hi>Ann</hi> was not a little trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and concerned, not well knowing what to do in this caſe. However, that Night af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> were gone, my Father with his Family ſitting at a great Fire in his Hall, <hi>Ann</hi> being alſo preſent, ſhe ſpake to my Father, and ſaith, <hi>Now they call</hi> (meaning the <hi>Fairies:)</hi> We all of us urg'd her not to go. In leſs than a half quarter of an Hour ſhe ſaith, <hi>Now they call a ſecond time.</hi> We incouraged her again not to go to them. By and by ſhe ſaith, <hi>Now they call a third time;</hi> Upon which away to her Chamber ſhe went to them (of all theſe three Calls of the <hi>Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> none heard them but <hi>Ann).</hi> After ſhe had been in her Chamber ſome time, ſhe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:50283:11"/>
came to us again with a Bible in her hand, and tells us, that whe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſhe came to the <hi>Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> they ſaid to her, Wha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, has th<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e been ſome <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> and <hi>Miniſters</hi> with you, and diſſwaded you from coming any more to us, ſaying we are evil Spirits, and that it was all the Deluſion of the Devil? Pray deſire them to read that Place of Scripture in the <hi>1ſt</hi> Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of St. <hi>John, chap.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>Dearly Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, believe not every Spirit, but try the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, whether they are of God,</hi> &amp;c. This Place of Scripture was turn'd down to in the ſaid Bible. (I told your Lordſhip before, <hi>Ann</hi> could not read.)</p>
            <p>After this one <hi>John Tregeagle</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> (who was Steward to the late <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Radnor)</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then a Juſtice of Peace in <hi>Cornwall,</hi> ſent his Warrant for <hi>Ann,</hi> and ſent her to <hi>Bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min</hi> Goal, and there kept her a long time. That Day the Conſtable came to execute his Warrant, <hi>Ann</hi> milking the Cows, the <hi>Fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> appeared to her, and told her, that a Conſtable would come that day with a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for to carry her before a Juſtice of Peace, and ſhe would be ſent to Goal. She ask'd them if ſhe ſhould abſcond and hide her ſelf: they anſwered her, No, ſhe ſhould fear nothing, but go with the Conſtable. So ſhe went with the Conſtable to the Juſtice, and he ſent her to <hi>Bodmin</hi>-Goal, and ordered the Priſon Keeper that ſhe ſhould be kept without Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als; and ſhe was ſo kept; and yet ſhe liv'd,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:50283:11"/>
and that without complaining. When the Seſſions came, the Juſtices of the Peace ſent their Warrant to one <hi>Giles Bawden,</hi> a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of ours, who was then Conſtable, for my Mother and my ſelf to appear before them at that Seſſions, to anſwer ſuch Queſtions as ſhould be demanded of us about our poor Maid <hi>Ann (Bodmin</hi> was eight Miles from my Father's, and it was the firſt time that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member I ever rode on Horſeback). When we came to the Seſſions, the firſt that was call'd in before the Juſtices was my Mother, (what Queſtions they ask'd her, I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member:) When they had done examining her, they deſired her to withdraw. As ſoon as ſhe came forth, I was brought in, and call'd to the upper end of the Table to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; and there was (I ſuppoſe him to be) the Clerk of the Peace with his Pen ready in his Hand to take my Examination (I do not remember that they did put me to my Oath). The firſt Queſtion they ask'd me was, <hi>My pritty little Child, what have you got in your Pockets?</hi> I very innocently and pertinently anſwered, <hi>Nothing, Sir, but my Cuffs,</hi> (Cuffs are worſted knit Gloves, which Children in our Country wear on their Hands to keep them warm) which I immediately pluck'd out of my Pocket, and ſhewed them. Their ſecond Queſtion to me was, <hi>If I had any Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als in my Pocket for my Maid</hi> Ann? I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>I had not.</hi> Upon this they laugh'd at my
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:50283:12"/>
childiſh Anſwers, (to ſuch Queſtions ſuch Anſwers) and ſo diſmiſs'd me as well as my Mother. But poor <hi>Ann</hi> lay in Goal for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time after; and alſo Juſtice <hi>Tregeagle,</hi> who was her great Perſecutor, kept her in his Houſe ſome time as a Priſoner, and that without Victuals. And at laſt when <hi>Ann</hi> was diſcharged out of Priſon, the Juſtices made an Order that <hi>Ann</hi> ſhould not live any more with my Father. Whereupon my Father's only Siſter, Mrs. <hi>Francis Tom,</hi> a Widow, near <hi>Padſtow,</hi> took <hi>Ann</hi> into her Family, and there ſhe liv'd a conſiderable time, and did many great Cures: but what they were, my Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Mr. <hi>Will. Tom,</hi> who then liv'd in the Houſe with his Mother, can give your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the beſt Account of any that I know li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, except <hi>Ann</hi> her ſelf. And from thence ſhe went to live with her own Brother, and in proceſs of time married as aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>And now, my Lord, if your Lordſhip ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that I ſhould give you an Account when and upon what occaſion theſe <hi>Fairies</hi> forſook our <hi>Ann,</hi> I muſt tell your Lordſhip, I am ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in that; ſhe her ſelf can beſt tell if ſhe could be prevailed with ſo to do: and the Hiſtory of it, and the reſt of the Paſſages of her Life, would be very acceptable and uſeful to the moſt curious and inquiſitive Part of Mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:50283:12"/>And now, my Lord, I think good here to put an end to my plain Relation of theſe very ſtrange Paſſages of this <hi>Ann Jefferies</hi>'s Life: It's only Matter of Fact which I have here faithfully related; I have not made any Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations nor Reflections upon any one Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. I leave your Lordſhip to your own free Thoughts and Judgment. I my ſelf cannot give one natural Reaſon for any one of theſe Paſſages that happened to this poor Woman, but muſt conclude with that great Apoſtle and Scholar St. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 11.33, 34, 35, 36. <hi>O the Depth of the Riches both of the Wiſdom and Knowledg of God! how unſearchable are his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his Ways paſt finding out! For who hath known the Mind of the Lord, or who hath been his Counſeller? Or who hath firſt given to him, and it ſhall be recompenſed unto him again? For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be Glory for ever. Amen.</hi>
