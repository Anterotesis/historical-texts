         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>IT is not the least of Man's Unhappiness, that he is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Enemy of his own Interest, having Opportunities for his own Advantage, he lets them slip, and by Brutish In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogitancy, rather than Natural Impotency, (as our Parents at first) he is soon cheated into his own Misery; his present Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment is his chiefest Atchievement, and he will have his Will tho' it be his Woe. He is apt to kill his Friends, (as the <hi>Jews</hi> did Christ) for their Endeavours to Save him, and to Court his Enemy (as <hi>Eglon</hi> did <hi>Ehud)</hi> whose Design was to Slay him. The great Controversy (between the Advocates for King <hi>Charles</hi> the First, and his wicked Favourites, and the Friends of the Parliament and People, that were necessitated to Resist him, could never have been spun out into above 40 Years length, had the dim Eyes of dull People been clear'd up to a true discerning of their Friends from their Oppressive Foes. How apt have the Idolizers of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First been, with the Army of the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> to travel to <hi>Samaria</hi> instead of <hi>Dothan,</hi> and with the <hi>Jews</hi> to gratify <hi>Caesar,</hi> in Crucifying their Saviour? Whereas heretofore they generally reputed for
<pb facs="tcp:37493:3"/>
Saints those faithful and couragious Barons, who lost their Lives in the Field, making a glorious War against Tyrants for the Common Liberty. Such as <hi>Symon de Mamfort,</hi> Earl of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> against <hi>Henry</hi> the Third; <hi>Thomas Platagenet,</hi> Earl of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> against <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot willingly ascribe the Love of Tyranny and Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, to the Natural Disposition of an <hi>English Man,</hi> but rather to two other Causes; the first is the Clergy of all Ranks, whose Pulpit Stuff from before 1640, till now, hath generally been the Doctrine, and perpetual Infusion of Servility and Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness, to their Hearers, and their Lives most commonly the Types of Worldliness, with a slender Pattern of Vertue, Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and Self-Denial, in their whole Practice. The Second is, I attribute it to the factious Inclination of most Mendivided from the Publick Interest of their Country, by several Selfish Ends and Humours of their Own; who may truly be call'd Sacrificers of the Common Welfare of Mankind, to their own private Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that they might thereby attain to their Ambitious Purposes. <hi>Dryden</hi> (as I am inform'd) gives this true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of these Sort of Men, <hi>viz. Mark those which Dote on</hi> Arbitrary Power, <hi>and you'l find them either</hi> Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brain'd-Fools, <hi>or</hi> Needy Bankrupts.</p>
            <p>'Tis a wonderful and amazing thing, to find so great a part of Mankind fondly and foolishly Doting, nay, which is more Unchristian, with a sort of Idolatry, Idolizing this Prince, when they are not capable of giving to the World a clear De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of one good Act he did designedly for the Benefit of his People: Certainly if his Virtue and Piety towards God, and his Country, had been in the least conspicuous, his mighty Adorers have been defective in their Panegerical En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiums of him; for I must with the greatest Assurance de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that neither by reading the Defences of him, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation with the greatest of his Advocates, could I find the least Cause to Esteem him a Saint, or to clear him from the
<pb facs="tcp:37493:3"/>
Tyrannical Oppression, nay, from the Blood and Misery of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> so justly laid to his Charge by the Parliament of 1640, and those worthy Patriots that join'd with them. Let the Advocates for Tyranny and Arbitrary Power say what they will to the contrary, I am confident the People of <hi>England</hi> have a great Esteem and Value for a King that Governs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Law, and, in all his Actions, aims at his People's Good equal with his own; and if at any time they betake themselves to Arms against their Prince, 'tis his, and not their Fault: Neither is it rational to believe, that the Generality of the Nobility, Gentry and Commonality of <hi>England,</hi> would, without an apparent Cause and Necessity, engage in a Bloody Civil War, and thereby run the hazard of their Lives and Fortunes: And he that shall consider impartially, in a Civil or Religious Sense, the Quality of those that espoused that King against their Native Country, will find the Parliament, and those that joined with them, did infinitely exceed, in all respects, the Party that assisted that King. For it is notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously known, that the Popish and Superstitious People through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Kingdom, were united, as one Man for the King against the Parliament; and if we consider them in a Civil respect, were not all the Pattentees, Monopolizers, Cruel Usurping Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressors, but Lords, Knights and Gentlemen, the Pillars of the Star-Chamber, Councel-Table, High Commission Court, &amp;c. were not these the great Abettors, and Supporters of that Bloody War, against the Parliament and People of <hi>England.</hi>

            <p>Were not his Clergy, for the generality of them, a wretched Parcel of Court Sycophants, that gave vent to those Plaguy-Doctrines of Non-Resistance, Absolute and Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (after the Mode of <hi>France)</hi> in Loans, Free-Quarter, Ship-money, Monopolies, &amp;c. during the Oppressive Ministery of <hi>Buckingham, Stafford,</hi> and <hi>Laud,</hi> that countenanced those two <hi>Court Parasites</hi> and Ear-Wiggs, <hi>Mountague</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waring,</hi> who poysoned the Ears of King <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>First,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:37493:4"/>
with such infectious Doctrine that proved to be fatal to the <hi>King</hi> and Kingdoms. 'Tis true indeed, both <hi>Montague</hi> and <hi>Manwaring</hi> were doom'd and condemn'd for the same in open Parliament, <hi>Sentenced</hi> and <hi>Fined,</hi> and made incapable of all <hi>Ecclesiastical Benefices</hi> and <hi>Promotions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But King <hi>Charles</hi> was so much in Love with these two wicked Levites, and their Doctrines, that soon after the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was dissolved, he punished them with two Fat Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks.</p>
            <p>That the World may know for what <hi>Manwaring</hi> was thus Rewarded by the King, I shall produce three of his pernicious Assertions out of his two Sermons before the King, Printed under the Title of Religion ond Allegiance.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That the King is not bound to observe the Laws concerning the</hi> Subjects Rights, <hi>but that his</hi> Will <hi>in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing</hi> Loans <hi>and</hi> Taxes <hi>without consent in</hi> Parliament <hi>doth oblige the</hi> Subjects <hi>Conscience,</hi> Upon Pain of Eternal Damnation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That they who refused the</hi> Loan, <hi>did offend against the</hi> Law of God, <hi>and against the</hi> Kings Supreme Authority; <hi>and thereby became</hi> Guilty <hi>of</hi> Impiety, <hi>Disloyalty, Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That</hi> Authority <hi>of</hi> Parliament <hi>is not necessary for the raising of</hi> Aids <hi>and</hi> Subsidies; <hi>and Dr.</hi> Sibthorp, Vicar <hi>of</hi> Brackley, <hi>printed a Sermon, which he Preached at the Assizes at</hi> Northampton, <hi>and Dedicated to the</hi> King, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he Poysons his Country with these vile</hi> Positions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That it is the Prince's Duty to direct and make Laws, (his Text, by the way, was</hi> Rom. 13. 7. Render therefore to all their Dues) <hi>he justified this by that Opposite Proof;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:37493:4"/>
Eccles. 8. 3, 4. He doth whatsoever pleases him.—Who may say unto him, what doest thou?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That</hi> all <hi>Antiquity is</hi> absolutely for absolute Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <hi>to Princes,</hi> in all Civil and Temporal Things.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That if Princes</hi> command any thing <hi>which Subjects</hi> may not perform, <hi>because against the Laws of God, of Nature, or Impossible,</hi> yet they are bound to undergo the Punishment, <hi>without Resistance, and</hi> so to yield a <hi>Passive Obedience,</hi> where they cannot Exhibit an Active One. <hi>P—g, Sh—k,</hi> and others, <hi>have largely since that time, obliged the World with these</hi> Enslaving Doctrines.</p>
            <p>As this King took great care to Reward such Ministers as these, so he was resolved to make Examples of those Pious and Worthy Clergy-men, that stood up against the Oppressions of those Times; for Brevities Sake, I shall instance but two of the many that might be Named. The first was, that Good Man Dr. <hi>Abbot,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> because he could not in Conscience comply with the King, who with Menaces re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him to License that abominable Sermon of <hi>Si<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>throps,</hi> (before mention'd) <hi>and thereby make that Good by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, which had been done against the Laws.</hi> And when the Lord <hi>Conway,</hi> Secretary of State, was sent with a threatning Message from the King to him, this good Old Man persisted in his Refusal, saying, with the Psalmist, <hi>I shall not be affraid of any Evil Tydings, for my heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The King instantly <hi>Suspended</hi> this Archbishop, and also <hi>confined him,</hi> and committed the <hi>Archiepiscopal Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> to <hi>five Bishops,</hi> all of the <hi>New Church of</hi> England, and <hi>Sibthorp's</hi> Patrons, <hi>viz. London, Durham, Rochester</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> and honest <hi>Laud</hi> of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:37493:5"/>
The second was Dr. <hi>Williams,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> who also felt the heavy Oppression of this <hi>Protestant King.</hi> In the first Year of his Reign, he was Lord Keeper of the <hi>reat Seal</hi> but upon his appearing in <hi>Parliament</hi> against the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms great Grievance, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> he was Disgraced und-Sequestred from the <hi>King's</hi> Presence, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Table. In his second Year, he was accused for speaking publickly against the <hi>Loan,</hi> and also for refusing to give way to proceedings in his Courts against the <hi>Puritans.</hi> The King Imprison'd him in the <hi>Tower,</hi> but this good Bishop, out-li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Imprisonment, <hi>upon the King's throwing the Gauntlet,</hi> he came to a <hi>Tryal of Skill,</hi> for the Old <hi>English</hi> Liberties, and he resolutely said, <hi>Nolumus Leges Anglia: Mutari,</hi> and took Command in the <hi>Parliament's Army,</hi> and bravely asserted his <hi>Country's</hi> Liberties with his <hi>Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I should proceed to relate how this King dealt by the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry; both Lawyers and others that stood up for the Laws of the Land, and Liberties of the People, this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Story would swell to too great a Bulk for a Preface; I shall therefore give a short Account of the matters contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the following Treatise, <hi>viz.</hi> that He Favoured, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, and was Ruled by, the worst of Men, both Clergy and Laity; <hi>Secondly,</hi> That He highly favoured Papists; <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> That He Govern'd by an Arbitrary Power, and raised Money upon his Subjects without Act of Parliament, which is directly against the Constitution of the Government of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and of a most dangerous Consequence to the People of <hi>England;</hi> for when ever such a Power is Established in these Kingdoms, the People may bid a sad farewell to all their Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, for they would soon undergood the same Miserable Fate, the poor People of <hi>France</hi> have done ever since that King vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated their <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> call'd, <hi>the Edict of</hi> Nants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is to be Taxed according to that Prince's Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That he was not that Pious Prince the mad

               <hi>To conclude,</hi> If all these and many more sad matters of Fact, already in this, and other Books produced to the World, will not be of force enough to satisfie the generality of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, that they have been most notoriously imposed upon, by the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and some of the <hi>Laity,</hi> in their <hi>Defence</hi> of <hi>King</hi> Charles <hi>I.</hi> against the <hi>Parliament</hi> of 1640. and <hi>People</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> I shall conclude, that nothing but the <hi>coming down of an Angel from Heaven,</hi> will be able to <hi>convince</hi> them of their <hi>Error;</hi> I shall, therefore leave them to God, and end all with this hearty Prayer, That he would be pleased so to open their Eyes, that they might see what will make for the Peace and Happiness of these Kingdoms, and no longer promote and keep up those Unhappy Divisions, that are yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst us, after above 40 Years Controversie on this Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly Subject.</p>

These <hi>heavy charges</hi> being made good against this <hi>Bishop,</hi> and he most <hi>righteously executed</hi> for these his notorious <hi>Evil Actions,</hi> Why are most of our <hi>Clergy,</hi> and some of our <hi>Laity</hi> so wicked, as to <hi>vindicate him,</hi> and without the <hi>least Reason,</hi> or shaddow of <hi>Truth,</hi> cry him up for a <hi>Blessed Martyr,</hi> that had <hi>violated all the Laws</hi> of the Land, and was so great <hi>a Cause of most of the Miseries of</hi> England?

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37493:13"/>
that Work, <hi>two things</hi> being with the greatest ease to be <hi>prov'd upon him.</hi> First, That he is a most <hi>Notorious Lyer,</hi> both as to his Assertions of the <hi>King's Innocency</hi> of those sad <hi>matters justly laid to his Charge,</hi> and also of his many <hi>unjust Accusations</hi> of the <hi>People of</hi> England; and secondly, That <hi>he was a Thief,</hi> and had so much <hi>Piety,</hi> as to have recourse to the famous Sir <hi>Philip Sydney</hi>'s Arcadia <hi>(a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance)</hi> in the time of his <hi>Troubles,</hi> and from thence to <hi>steal the Prayer of</hi> Pamelia (to an Heathen Diety) <hi>being under Imprisonment;</hi> not finding a suitable <hi>Form</hi> in the <hi>Liturgy, Psalms</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> or any other places of the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture.

This Noble Earl's <hi>Advertisement,</hi> or <hi>Memorandum,</hi> must have the greater Weight, for that he concealed it (for ought I can hear) from the Publick, which doubtless he would not have done, if he had had any design to carry it on by making it Publick. This <hi>Memorandum</hi> being true, the World has the Words of two <hi>Kings,</hi> that Bishop <hi>Gauden,</hi> and not King <hi>Charles, <hi>Composed this lying Book:</hi>
               </hi> For further proof, that Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> writ this Book, take a Summary Account of some Papers relating, <hi>Eicon Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silice,</hi> now, or lately in the Hands of Mr. <hi>North,</hi> Merchant, living on <hi>Tower Hill,</hi> London; whereby it appears that Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> late Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> and afterwards of <hi>Worcester,</hi> was the Author of that Book, and not King <hi>Charles</hi> I. as the World hath for above Forty Years been imposed upon to believe.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>North</hi> is a worthy Person, and a Member of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> he, and Mr. <hi>Charles Gauden</hi> (the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's Son) married two Sisters, and Mr. <hi>Gauden</hi> dying about Ten Years since, all his Papers were left with his Widow, and Mr. <hi>North</hi> having occasion to look them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, for some relating to his Sister-in-laws affairs, found these relating to the <hi>Eicon Basilice,</hi> carefully tied up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>North,</hi> by reason of his Marriage, had many years acquaintance with Bishop <hi>Gauden's</hi> Family, and knows that the Bishop's Widow, at first gave them to her Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Son, <hi>John Gauden,</hi> and upon his Death, they came to Mr. <hi>Charles Gauden.</hi> And further, that in his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years knowledge of that Family, it hath constantly, and without any manner of doubt, been declared, that the Bishop was the Author of the Book. There are seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Letters and Papers, I shall briefly give the Contents of them, for the truth of which, I shall refer to the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Papers,</hi> and to those many reverend and worthy Persons, who have Read, or been at the Reading of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:37493:15"/>
Bishop <hi>Gauden,</hi> at the time of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Restauration, was incumbent of <hi>Bocking</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> and from that fat Parsonage was promoted to the <hi>Lean Bishoprick</hi> of <hi>Exeter,</hi> which he complain'd was not sufficient to keep up the Port of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> and thought that by his Merits he might lay claim to a better; and the Death of Dr. <hi>Duppa,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> being daily expected, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd himself to the King, with great Importunity, to be translated thither; pleading his Desert, which, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the Papers I mention, could be no other than that of having written a Book which did such great Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the <hi>Royal Family,</hi> that King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d. thought himself oblig'd to promise him that Bishoprick, tho' when it became Void gave it to an other.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is Letter from Sir <hi>Edward Nicholas,</hi> Secretary of State, to Dr. <hi>Gauden,</hi> dated <hi>January</hi> 1660, wrote by the King's Command, intimating the King had received his Letter, and that he should not have Cause to complain of his removal from <hi>Bocking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In the Bishops Letter to Chancellor <hi>Hide,</hi> dated 28. <hi>December</hi> 1661, and his Petition to the King, the Bishop sets forth, That he had <hi>an high</hi> Rack [The Bishoprick of <hi>Exeter]</hi> but Empty Manger; and declares what hazards he had run of Life and Estate; and what great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage had accrued to the Crown by his Service: That what he had done was <hi>for Comforting and incouraging of the King's Friends, Exposing his Enemies,</hi> and <hi>converting,</hi> &amp;c. He pleads that <hi>what was done like a King, should have a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Retribution;</hi> and Instances in the Cases of <hi>Joseph, Mordecai,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> who were Honoured and Rewarded for the Service they did to the Respective Princes, (tho' as he observes) they were Captives in a strange Land.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Bishops Letter to the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> dated the 17th of <hi>January</hi> 1661: Strongly urges the great Services he had done, and Importunately Begs his <hi>Royal Highness,</hi> to intercede for him with the <hi>King.</hi>

4. There is an Original Letter from the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor <hi>Hide</hi> (all of his own hand writing) to the Bishop of <hi>Exeter,</hi> dated <hi>13th.</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 1661, importing, that the Chancellor had received several Letters from him: That he was uneasy under the Bishop's Importunity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses his not being yet able to serve him; Speaks of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexing a <hi>Commendum</hi> to his Bishoprick; and towards the close it hath this remarkable Expression, <hi>The Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar you mention,</hi> has indeed been imparted to me as a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret; I am sorry I ever knew it, and <hi>When it ceases to be a Secret, it will please none but Mr. Milton.</hi> This is Subscribed, <hi>Edw. Hide,</hi> C.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Mrs. <hi>Gauden</hi> after the Death of the Bishop, writes to her Son Mr. <hi>John Gauden,</hi> That she had sent him an Hogs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Cyder, and Orders some Pictures to be sent her by the same Man.</p>
            <p>In this Letter she speaks of the Book commonly call'd the <hi>Kings;</hi> she calls it the <hi>Jewel;</hi> and tells her Son, that <hi>her Husband hoped to make a Fortune by it,</hi> and wonders it should be doubted whether her Husband wrote it; but says, <hi>She has a Letter of a very Great Man's</hi> that will clear it up.</p>
            <p n="6">6. There is also a long <hi>Narrative</hi> of Mrs. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s Hand-writing, shewing, that her Husband wrote the Book. This she sent to her Son, with the Letter, wherein she said, <hi>She had sent it that she might be a</hi> Clavis <hi>to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Narrative sets forth, That after her Husband had wrote the Book, He shewed it to the Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved it, and was for the printing of it; but wished <hi>the King</hi> might have a Sight of it.</p>
            <p>That an Opportunity was taken to Convey it to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty by the Lord Marquiss of <hi>Hertford,</hi> when He went to the <hi>Treaty</hi> at the <hi>Isle of Wight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Marquiss after his Return from thence, told her Husband, that he gave the Book to the <hi>King;</hi> and his <hi>Majesty</hi> did not like it, but was for putting it out, not
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:37493:16"/>
as his own, but another's. But it being Urged, That <hi>CROMWEL,</hi> and others of the Army, <hi>having got a great Reputation with the People,</hi> for Parts and Piety, <hi>it would do best to be in the King's Name.</hi> His <hi>Majesty</hi> took time to consider of it.</p>
            <p>That the Marquiss told her Husband, <hi>He knew not what was become of the Papers;</hi> and said, <hi>God knows what will become of the King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That her Husband not hearing the King's pleasure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, and finding Danger hastening on him, he having kept a Copy by him, sent it by one Mr. <hi>Symmonds,</hi> a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted Minister, to the Press, together with a Letter. That Mr. <hi>Royston</hi> was the Painter, but did not know but the <hi>King</hi> wrote it: That part of it was seized in the Press, together with her Husband's Letter, and Mr. <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds</hi> was taken.</p>
            <p>Nevertherless the Work was carried on, and finished a few days after his Majesty's death: That when it was published, the Parliament was Enraged; and her Husband conceiving his Life and Estate to be in danger, fled to Sir <hi>John Wennworth</hi>'s, near <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> intending thence to pass the Seas: But Mr. <hi>Symmonds</hi> falling sick, and dying soon after, not having been Examin'd, and it not being discovered that her Husband was concern'd in it, (the Letter which had been taken having no Name to it) he altered his purpose, and returned home.</p>
            <p>That there was an Epistle at first intended: That the first Title was <hi>Suspisia Regalia,</hi> but changed to <hi>Eicon Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silice;</hi> and that there were two Chapters added.</p>
            <p>That the Marquiss of <hi>Hertford,</hi> the Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> Bishop <hi>Duppa,</hi> and Bishop <hi>Morley,</hi> were at first the only Persons privy to it.</p>
            <p>That after the King's Restoration, Dr. <hi>Morley</hi> told her Husband, That his Merit was such, that he could Ask nothing but he could receive it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:37493:17"/>
That <hi>Duppa,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> being very sick, her Husband went to the <hi>King,</hi> and <hi>acquainted him that He was the Author of the Book;</hi> and for the Truth thereof ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to Bishop <hi>Duppa,</hi> his Majesty's <hi>Tutor,</hi> who was yet living; and made an Apology for printing it, without his Majesty's Father's Order, or his; but pleaded the Circumstances of Time, and the King's danger.</p>
            <p>That His Majesty told her Husband, That till then, He never knew that he wrote it, but thought it was his Father's; yet wondred how he could have time: And ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served <hi>That it was wrote like a Scholar, as well as like a King;</hi> and said that if it had been published sooner, it might have saved his Fathers Life. That at the same time the King gave him a Promise of the Bishoprick of <hi>Winchester.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That when he afterwards acquainted the <hi>Duke of York</hi> That he was the Author of that Book, yet went under his Father's Name, the <hi>Duke</hi> answered, He thought his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Wrote it. That her Husband then told his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, that the <hi>King</hi> had promised him the Bishoprick of <hi>Winchester;</hi> and that his Highness assured him of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>That Bishop <hi>Duppa</hi> dying, her Husband apply'd to the <hi>King</hi> upon his Promise; but Dr. <hi>Morley,</hi> (who had told her Husband that he might have what he would ask) got it; and her Husband was made Bishop of <hi>Worcester;</hi> but having enjoy'd it but about half a Year, fell Sick and Dyed.</p>
            <p>That She Petitioned the King; setting forth. That her Husband left her a Widdow, with four Sons and a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: That it cost her Husband 200 <hi>l.</hi> to remove from <hi>Exeter</hi> to <hi>Worcester;</hi> and pray'd his Majesty to bestow the half Years Rents upon her, which he denied, and gave them to another.</p>
            <p>Reader, take Notice, This is the Substance, tho' not perhaps the Express Words of Mrs. <hi>Gaudens</hi> Papers, and it
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:37493:17"/>
could be wished, that the Papers themselves were made Publick, then this short account would be fully justified.</p>
            <p>I cannot dismish this matter without admiring the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Providence of God, in the several steps towards the Discovery thereof, which was the interest of so great a number of Men, to have for ever Concealed and Buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. Had not Dr. <hi>Gauden</hi> been disappointed of the Bisho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prick of <hi>Winchester,</hi> we should never have heard of his compiling the <hi>Icon Basilice;</hi> nor would he ever have bragg'd, <hi>That he had done like a King, if he had had a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Retribution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Had Mrs. <hi>Gauden</hi> but been made Bishop of <hi>Worcester</hi> for half an Year, she would probably have robb'd her Husband of the Glory of this Book, and suffered it to have been for ever a <hi>Jewel</hi> of the <hi>Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the World may have a further satisfaction in this matter, I shall give a short account of what the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and Pious Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> lately Rector of <hi>Feyfield</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> hath Written and Published a short time before he died, in Answer to the Ignorance and lying Impertinence of Dr. <hi>Hollingworth,</hi> Dr. <hi>Anthony Walker,</hi> in this Book call'd the <hi>True Account</hi> of the <hi>Author,</hi> of a Book Entitled, <hi>Icon Basilice,</hi> &amp;c. gives the Reason of his Writing on this Subject. It was occasion'd by Dr. <hi>Hollingworth</hi>'s Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Charge on him, for declaring, That <hi>King</hi> Charles I. <hi>was not the Author of that Book.</hi> He secondly, solemnly appeals to the Searcher of Hearts, Avenger of Falshood, and Revealer of Secrets; that he will write nothing for Truth, that he was not thoroughly perswaded of, and that by as full Evidence as he judged such a matter of Fact wanted, and at such distance of Time, is capable of. Thirdly, that he will with undisguised openness, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the means of his Knowledge, the reasons of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and the probable Arguments upon which his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is Grounded. His Word are these: <hi>Fol. 3. Sect.</hi> 11.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:37493:18"/>
               <hi>I</hi> know <hi>and</hi> believe <hi>the</hi> Book, <hi>whose Author is enquired after, was Written by Dr.</hi> Gauden, <hi>(except two Chapters Writ by Bishop</hi> Duppa) <hi>so far as the subjoined means may produce such Knowledge, and the Reasons may induce such Belief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>Dr.</hi> Gauden, <hi>sometime before the Whole was finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was pleased to acquaint me with his Design, and shewed me the Heads of divers Chapters, and some of the Discourses written of them, and after some time spent in persual, he vouchsaft to ask my Opinion concerning it, and after some consideration, I told him, I supposed, it would be much for the</hi> King's Reputation, Honour and Safety: <hi>But I expresly added,</hi> I stuck at the lawfulness of it, and modestly asked him, how he satisfyed himself, so to impose upon the World? <hi>To which he so readily replied, that I concluded he had thought on it before,</hi> viz. look on the Title, 'tis the Portraicture, <hi>&amp;c. and no Man draws his own Picture, which satisfyed himself; and that he perfectly remembers, that in the 2 Chapter of the Earl of</hi> Strafford, <hi>in the first Edition,</hi> p. 8. l. 18, 19, 20. <hi>he explain'd, that he meant Dr.</hi> Juxton, <hi>then Bishop of</hi> London, <hi>in the following passage,</hi> viz. He only hath been least vext by them, who counsel'd me, not to consent against the Vote of my own Conscience.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>That some good time after, what had passed as now related, we being both in</hi> London, <hi>and having dined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>in the Afternoon desired me to walk with him to a</hi> Friend; <hi>when we were gone part of the way, he told me he was going to the Bishop of</hi> Salisbury, <hi>Dr.</hi> Duppa <hi>(whom he had acquainted with</hi> his design) <hi>to fetch what he had left with his</hi> Lordship <hi>to be perused, or to shew him what he had further Written, desired me after a little Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to with-draw and leave them two alone, which I did, and after they had been some considerable time together, Dr.</hi> Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <hi>returned, and in the street gave me this Account of their Conference. My Lord of</hi> Salisbury <hi>told me there were</hi> two subjects more, <hi>he</hi> wished <hi>I had</hi> thought on, <hi>and propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:37493:18"/>
them to me,</hi> viz. <hi>The</hi> Ordinance <hi>against the</hi> Common Prayer Book, <hi>and the</hi> denying <hi>His Majesty the</hi> Attendance <hi>of his</hi> Chaplains <hi>(which are now the</hi> 16th. <hi>and</hi> 24th. <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the Printed Book, and desired me to Write two Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon them, which I promised, I would. But before we parted, he recalled that request, and said, I pray go you on, to finish what remains, and leave these two to me: I will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare two Chapters upon them, which accordingly he did, as Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>owned to me and others whom he had made privy to the whole, and</hi> never pretended to have Written these, as he did to have done all the rest.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Sometime after the King was Beheaded, I asked Dr.</hi> Gauden, <hi>whether the King had ever seen the Book? he gave me this Answer, I know it certainly, no more then you; but I used my best endeavours he might, for I delivered a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of it to the Marquess of</hi> Hartford, <hi>when he went to the Treaty at the Isle of</hi> Wight, <hi>and intreated his</hi> Lordship, <hi>if he could obtain any private opportunity, he would deliver it to</hi> His Majesty, <hi>and humbly desire to know</hi> His Pleasure <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. But matters running then high against the</hi> King, <hi>he had no answer by that</hi> Lord.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>After he was Lord Bishop of</hi> Worcester Elect, <hi>I asked him in private, whether that King</hi> Charles II. <hi>knew that he wrote it? He gave me this Answer; I cannot possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively and certainly say, he doth, because, he was never pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to take express notice of it to me. But, I take it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he doth; for I am sure the Duke of</hi> York <hi>doth, for he hath spoken of it to me, and</hi> own'd it as a seasonable and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable service, <hi>and he knowing it, I question not but the</hi> King <hi>also doth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Mrs.</hi> Gauden <hi>his Wife, Mr.</hi> Gifford <hi>(who, if I am not mistaken,</hi> Transcribed <hi>that</hi> Copy <hi>that was sent to the Isle of</hi> Wight) <hi>and my self, believed it as much as we could any thing, and when we spake of it in his Presence, or Absence, did it, without the least</hi> Doubt <hi>of his having</hi> Writ it; <hi>and
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37493:19"/>
we should be imposed upon to the highest degree imaginable, if Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>wrote it not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sixthly, <hi>Dr.</hi> Gauden <hi>delivered to me with his own hand, what was last sent up (after part was Printed, or at least in Mr.</hi> Royston's <hi>hand to be Printed) and after he had shew'd it me, and sealed it up, gave me strict caution, with what wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riness to carry and deliver it, and according to his Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I delivered it,</hi> Saturday <hi>December</hi> 23d. 1648. <hi>in the Evening to one</hi> Peacock <hi>(Brother to Dr.</hi> Gauden'<hi>s Steward or Bayliff) who was instructed by what hands he should trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to Mr.</hi> Royston, <hi>and in the same method, a few days after the Impression was finished,</hi> I received six Books <hi>by the hand of Mr.</hi> Peacock, <hi>as an acknowledgment of</hi> that little I contributed to that Service; <hi>one of which I have still by me, and to justifie this matter against the ignorant impudence of Dr.</hi> Hollingsworth, <hi>he Declares</hi> Fol. 15. <hi>That he is ready to</hi> confirm <hi>his</hi> Knowledge <hi>and</hi> Belief <hi>herein with a</hi> Solemn Oath.</p>
            <p>Mrs. <hi>Gauden,</hi> Widow, residing at <hi>Gloucester,</hi> and often Declaring that her Husband had writ that, call'd, the <hi>King's Book,</hi> it coming at last to the knowledge of Dr. <hi>Nicholson</hi> then Bishop of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> who desiring to be fully satisfied in that point, did put the Question to her, upon her <hi>receiving the Sacrament,</hi> and she then affirmed, that it was <hi>wrote by her Husband.</hi> This, Persons of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted credit now living in <hi>Gloucester,</hi> can affirm for a Truth; and it is not question'd, but the present Bishop of <hi>Gloucester,</hi> will acknowledge that those Persons have related this matter to him, that it is well known to Mrs. <hi>Gauden</hi>'s Brother, and several of her Relations, that Mrs. <hi>Gauden</hi> constantly in her Conversation, Declared, <hi>That her Husband was the Author of this Book.</hi> I could, if necessity requird, produce a great many Arguments more out of Doctor <hi>Walkers,</hi> or other Writings, to prove the Truth of this matter, but shall conclude it with this one
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37493:19"/>
of the <hi>Doctors,</hi> in reference to the Providence of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Though</hi> God <hi>had many Holy, Righteous and Gracious ends to serve his Providence by, in the</hi> Publication of this Book; <hi>yet as I find it expressed in this very Book,</hi> Chap. the last p. 262. of the first Edition. <hi>God's wise Providence (we know) oft permits many Events, which his revealed Word, in no sort approves.</hi> And, <hi>I confess, I have many cogent reasons to persuade me, that God was not well pleased with Dr.</hi> Gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, <hi>others, or my self; for what we contributed to it.</hi> And <hi>though for the aforesaid ends, he suffered it to succeed,</hi> yet I know not but he may have other ends now to serve, <hi>by suffering this Discovery to be Wrung, and rested from me,</hi> (I had almost said) <hi>by some Bodies (viz.</hi> Hollingworths) <hi>Impertinent Affectation, to meddle with what he understands not.</hi> Thus spake that good Man.</p>
            <p>I had not enlarged so much on this <hi>21st.</hi> Article, but that I was desirous of giving full satisfaction to the World, of the <hi>Real Author</hi> of <hi>Eicon Basilice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Posterity might not be deceived by the many Impudent, Ignorant, False, and Scandalous <hi>Assertions</hi> of most of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and too many of the <hi>Laity,</hi> who to their Eternal Shame have taken more care and pains to defend that <hi>Book,</hi> and its pretended Author King <hi>Charles</hi> I. than they done to Vindicate the <hi>Holy Bible,</hi> and the <hi>Truth of the Christian Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="22">22. That caused the <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> and <hi>High-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission-Courts</hi> to be made Use of, to the general Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the People of <hi>England,</hi> and was unwilling to part with them, till he found these Courts were highly offensive to the Parliament, and that it was not Season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to displease the Kingdom at that time, for which Reasons at last he pass'd the Bills to take them away: And indeed there were many, and great Reasons, why those abominable oppressive Courts should be pull'd down,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37493:20"/>
and taken away. For that <hi>Old Serpent</hi> Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> and divers of his Brethren, had cast off all Humanity, and were metamorphosed into <hi>Ravenous Wolves,</hi> and these <hi>Courts</hi> were under their Management. The <hi>Star-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> had abounded in Extravagant Censures, whereby the Subjects were oppress'd by Grievious Fines, Imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Stigmatizings, Mutilations, Whippings, Pillories, Gags, Banishments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the <hi>High Commission Court,</hi> was grown to such Excess of Sharpness and Severity, as was not much less than the <hi>Spanish Inquisition.</hi> To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat two or three of the many Instances of the Horrid Oppressions, and barbarous Cruelty, exercised in these <hi>Tyrannical Courts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the <hi>17th.</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> 1629. Dr. <hi>Leighton</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Black Fryers Church,</hi> (it seems then he was no Conventicler) was seized by a Warrant from the <hi>High Commission Court,</hi> and dragged to Bishop <hi>Laud</hi>'s House; from thence without any Examination, he was carried to <hi>New-gate,</hi> and there clapt into <hi>Irons,</hi> and thrust into a <hi>Nasty Hole,</hi> where he continued from <hi>Tuesday</hi> Night, till <hi>Thursday</hi> Noon, without Meat or Drink: They kept him in that loathsome Place, where Snow and Rain beat in upon him Fifteen Weeks, not permitting his Wife, or any Friend, to come near him, and <hi>denyed to give him a Copy of his Commitment;</hi> then they brought him into the <hi>Star-Chamber Court,</hi> where an <hi>Information</hi> was Exhibited a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, for Publishing a Book, call'd, <hi>Lyon's Plea against the P<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Leighton</hi> confess'd, that in 1628. He drew up the Heads of that Book, and having the approbation of five hundred Persons, under their hands, some whereof were Parliament Men. He went into <hi>Holland,</hi> and got between five and six hundred Printed for the use of the Parliament; but they being Dissolved, he returned home, not bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of them into the Land, but made it his special care
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37493:20"/>
to suppress them. In the same information, the Doctor was charged with these Words in the said Book; <hi>He do not read of greater Persecutions of God's People in any Nation professing the Gospel, then in this our Island, especially since the Death of Queen</hi> Elizabeth. He confessed the Words, and Answered, <hi>That the thing was too true, as appeared by the Prelates taking away Life and Livelihood from many Ministers and private Men;</hi> of whom, many were pined to Death in Prison, and many wandred up and down, their Families being left desolate and helpless: That besides this, <hi>the Blood of Souls</hi> had been endanger'd by the <hi>Removal</hi> of the <hi>Faithful Shepheards</hi> from the <hi>Flock;</hi> this was a cutting Truth. And</p>
            <p>Wicked <hi>Laud,</hi> being enraged, <hi>Desired the Court to put the highest Censure that could be put upon him;</hi> which they did to his Content, <hi>Condemning him to have his Ears cut, his Nose slit, to be Branded in the Face, Whipped at a Post, to stand on a Pillory, to pay Ten Thousand Pound fine (tho' they knew he was not worth so much) and to be perpetually Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned.</hi> This <hi>Hellish Sentence</hi> being past, that vile Wretch <hi>Laud</hi> was so well pleased with it, that he pull'd of his <hi>Cap,</hi> and holding up his Hands, <hi>gave thanks to God who had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him Victory over his Enemies.</hi> This Sentence being so miserably severe, the Execution thereof was little expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted. But,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laud</hi> had his design; for upon the <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> 1630. The Censure was Executed in a most cruel manner, <hi>His Ears were cut, his Nose slit, his Face Branded with burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Irons, he was tyed to a Post, and Whipped with a treble Cord, to that cruel Degree,</hi> that he himself Writing the History thereof Ten Years after, affirmed that <hi>every lash brought away the Flesh,</hi> and that he should feel it to his dying day. He was lastly, <hi>put into the Pillory,</hi> and kept there near two hours in Frost and Snow; and then, after this most barbarous Usage, not permitted to return to his Quarters
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37493:21"/>
in the <hi>Fleet Prison,</hi> in a Coach provided to carry him, but compelled in that sad Condition, and severe Season, to go by Water.</p>
            <p>After this, <hi>was kept Ten Weeks in Dirt and Mire,</hi> not being sheltered from Rain and Snow; <hi>They shut him up most closely, Twenty Two Months, and he remain'd a Prison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Ten or Eleven Years, not suffered to breath in the open Air,</hi> until that <hi>Noble Parliament</hi> of <hi>November,</hi> 1640. most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily delivered him. When he came abroad to prosecute his Petition, in that <hi>Parliament,</hi> he could neither <hi>Go, See,</hi> nor <hi>Hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>Dismal Story,</hi> will be an <hi>Eternal Blot,</hi> not only on <hi>Laud,</hi> who was the chief Instrument in that <hi>sad Oppression,</hi> but also upon the <hi>pretended Martyr King</hi> Charles, for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting such Barbarous, and inhumane Cruelties to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised on his Subjects. I shall shew you something more of this <hi>Bloody Villains Barbarity,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p>That upon the first of <hi>February, 1632. Laud</hi> procured Mr. <hi>Prin,</hi> to be sent close Prisoner to the <hi>Tower,</hi> there he lay till the <hi>21st.</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1633. when an Information (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mentioning any particular Passages in his Book) was exhibited against him, in the <hi>Star Chamber Court,</hi> for Publishing a Book concerning <hi>Interludes,</hi> intitled, <hi>Histrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mastix, which was Licensed by a Chaplain of Dr.</hi> Abbatts, Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi> Upon the <hi>17th.</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> 1633. notwithstanding his Book was Licensed, yet he had this heavy Sentence passed upon him, <hi>viz. To be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned for Life, pay Five Thousand Pounds Fine, be Expell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> Lincolns-Inn, <hi>Disabled to Exercise the Profession of a Barrister, Degraded by the University of</hi> Oxford <hi>of his Degrees there taken; and that done, to be set in the Pillory at</hi> Westminster, <hi>and have one of his Ears there cut off, and at another time, to be set in the Pillory in</hi> Cheap-side, <hi>and there to have his other Ear cut off.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:37493:21"/>
Though many of the Lords never dreamt of the Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of this Horrid Judgment, nay, though Queen <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietta Maria,</hi> (which deserves an Honourable Mention) and she shall have it, for <hi>She was the present King's Royal Grandmother, earnestly interceded with the Biggotted, Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, and Merciless King, (who was an abominable T—) to remit its Execution;</hi> yet on the <hi>7th.</hi> and <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> it was fully Executed with great Rigour, and Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> remain'd <hi>Sundry Years</hi> in the <hi>Tower</hi> upon this censure.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Burton,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Bastwrick,</hi> were also without the least just cause violently prosecuted after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; it will be too tedious to relate theirs and others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian uses; when <hi>Tyranny</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> were <hi>Rampant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="23">23. That against the <hi>Law of Nature,</hi> against the <hi>Rules of Iustice,</hi> falsely charged those Innocent Men, the Noble Lord <hi>Mandeville,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hollis,</hi> Mr. <hi>Strode,</hi> and others, with <hi>Treason,</hi> for which in the Face of the <hi>Highest Iudicature in the Kingdom,</hi> they were most unjustly Imprisoned, the King <hi>denying them the Names of their Accusers;</hi> and which was an <hi>Act of Tyranny</hi> beyond Parrallel, <hi>He accused them, and yet would produce no Witness, he confessed them clear in his own Iudgment, yet they must not profess their own Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for fear of wounding his Honour.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="1">

1. <hi>That the design of</hi> altering Religion, <hi>had been potent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly carried on, by those in greatest Authority about him; the</hi> Queen's <hi>Agent at</hi> Rome, <hi>the</hi> Pope's Nuncio <hi>here, are not only Evidences of this Design, but have been great Actors in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That the War with</hi> Scotland, <hi>was procured to make way for this Intent, and chiefly fomented by the Papists, and others Popishly affected, whereof we have many Evidences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That the Rebellion in</hi> Ireland, <hi>was framed and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved here in</hi> England; <hi>and that the</hi> English <hi>Papists should have risen about the same time:</hi> We have several Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, <hi>&amp;c. The</hi> Irish <hi>Rebels affirm, That they do nothing but by Authority from the King; they call themselves the</hi> Queen's <hi>Army; the Booty which they take from the</hi> English, <hi>they mark with the</hi> Queen's <hi>mark, and it is proved, that their purpose was to come to</hi> England, <hi>after they had done in</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The labouring to infuse into Your Majesties Subjects an evil Opinion of the</hi> Parliament, <hi>and other Symptons of a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of</hi> raising Arms, <hi>and dividing your People by a</hi> Civil War, <hi>in which Combustion,</hi> Ireland <hi>must needs be lost, and this Kingdom miserably wasted and consumed, if not wholly ruined and destroyed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>That Your Majesty sent away the Lord</hi> Digby <hi>by your own Warrant beyond Sea, after a Vote had passed in the</hi> House of Commons, <hi>Declaring, That he had appear'd in a Warlike manner at</hi> Kingston <hi>upon</hi> Thames, <hi>to the terror of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties good Subjects; that he being so got beyond Sea, he vented his traiterous Conceptions, that Your Majesty should declare your Self, and retire to a place of Strength, and inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated some service which he might do in those parts, whereby, in probability, he intended the procuring of some</hi> Foreign Force <hi>to strengthen Your Majesty, in that Condition into which he would have brought you; which malicious Counsel, we have great cause to doubt, made too deep an Impression in Your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:37493:23"/>
considering the course you are pleased to take, of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting your Self from that Parliament, <hi>and carrying the Prince with you, which seems to express a purpose in Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty to keep your Self in a readiness for the Acting of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The manifold Advertisements which we have had from</hi> Rome, Venice, Paris, <hi>and other parts,</hi> That they still ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that Your Majesty has some great design in hand, for the altering of Religion, <hi>the breaking the Neck of your Parliament, and that you will yet find means to compass that design; that the</hi> Pope's Nuncio <hi>hath sollicited the Kings of</hi> France <hi>and</hi> Spain <hi>to lend Your Majesty</hi> 4000 <hi>Men a piece, to help to maintain your Royalty against the Parliament.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>These are some of the grounds of our</hi> Fears <hi>and</hi> Jealousies, <hi>which made us so earnestly to implore your Royal Authority and Protection for our Defence, and security, in all the ways of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and Submission, which being denyed by Your Majesty,</hi> We do with sorrow apply our selves to the use of that Power <hi>[viz. the Militia]</hi> which by the Fundamental Laws of this Kingdom, resides in us; yet still resolving to keep our selves within the Bounds of Faithfullness, and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to your Sacred Person and your Crown.</p>
            <p>And as to the <hi>Fears and Iealousies</hi> which His Majesty seem'd to have Entertained of them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> thus Answered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We have according to Your Majesties desires, laid our hands upon our Hearts; we have asked our selves in the strictest Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of our Consciences; we have searched our Affections, our Thoughts; considered our Actions, and can find none that can give Your Majesty any just Occasion to absent your self from</hi> White-Hall, <hi>and the</hi> Parliament; <hi>but that you may with more Honour and Safety continue there, than in any other place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Your Majesty lays a great Charge upon Us; if you will gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously be pleased to let us know the Particulars, we shall give a clear and satisfactory Answer: But what hope can we have of ever giving Your Majesty satisfaction, when those particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars

which you have been made believe were true, yet being produced and made known to us, appeared to be false; and Your Majesty notwithstanding, will neither</hi> Punish, <hi>nor</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>the Authors: But go on to contract new Iealousies and Fears, upon general and uncertain Grounds, affording Us no means or possibility of particular Answer, to the clearing of our selves.</hi> We beseech Your Majesty to consider in what state you are, <hi>how easie and fair a way You have to Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, Honour, and Greatness, Plenty and Security, if you will joyn with the Parliament in the Defence of the Religion, and publick good of the Kingdom;</hi> this is all we expect from you. <hi>And for this we return to you, our Lives, Fortunes, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Endeavours to support Your Majesty, Your just Power and Soveraignty over us;</hi> but it is not Words that can secure us in these our humble Desires. <hi>We cannot, but too well and sorrowfully remember, what</hi> Gracious Messages <hi>we had from You this Summer, when</hi> with your Privity, <hi>the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Army was in Agitation: We cannot but with the like Affections recall to our Minds, how, not two days before your own coming to the Commons House, You sent a</hi> Gracious Message, <hi>that You would always have a care of their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, as of your own Prerogative; of the safety of their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as of your own Children: That which we expect, which will give us Assurance, that you have</hi> no thought but of Peace and Justice to your People, <hi>must be some real effect of your Goodness to them, in granting those things which your present necessity of the Kingdom do inforce us to desire; and that you will be Graciously pleased to put from you those</hi> Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous Counsellors, <hi>which have caused all these Dangers and Distractions, and to continue your own Residence and the Princes, near</hi> London <hi>and the</hi> Parliament, <hi>which we hope will be an happy beginning of Contentment and Confidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt.

Heads of the Declaration, to which the King Answered: <hi>Have I violated your Laws?</hi> To which both Houses made this pertinent Reply. <hi>We are heartily sorry We have such plentiful Matter of an Answer to that Question,</hi> Have I vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated your Laws?</p>
            <p>I must also take Notice, that in the beginning of the Year, 1642. a time when the King was in appearance transacting matters amicably with the two Houses, and we seemed to be in a deep Peace; a time when he Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>That he had received no other Carriage from his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, than what he professed himself satisfied with; and that if the Bills he had past, were again to be offered, he should cheerfully and readily Assent unto them.</hi> Even then, he dispatch'd away Letters, and an Agent to the King of <hi>Denmark,</hi> complaing of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and asking Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies from thence, <hi>AD PROPUL SANDOS HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STES,</hi> you know the English of that is, to <hi>Subdue his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,</hi> and declared himself in these Words; <hi>Ad allia Consilia Animum Convertendum Duximus:</hi> We resolve to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take our selves to new Counsels. <hi>The very Words he used to that Parliament in the Year,</hi> 1628.</p>
            <p>Further, upon the discovery of his Plot to bring up the <hi>English</hi> Army against the <hi>Parliament,</hi> he turn'd to the <hi>Scottish Army</hi> then at <hi>New Castle,</hi> and baited his Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with a rich Reward, <hi>not only to have 300000 l. in hand, and the spoil of</hi> London, <hi>but four Northern Counties to be made</hi> Scotists. Moreover, to encourage them to joyn with him, he Declared to them, <hi>That he was to have Money and Horse from</hi> Denmark, <hi>and that he would make</hi> York <hi>the place of his Residence,</hi> for the better accommodation of both Nations, or fuller Revenge upon <hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He also gathered Men in <hi>London,</hi> under pretence of raising <hi>Forces</hi> for <hi>Portugal, who were to possess themselves of the</hi> Tower. The Queen in <hi>Holland</hi> was buying Arms, and His Majesty had actually raised Forces in divers
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:37493:25"/>
Counties. The <hi>Parliament</hi> was all this time Petitioning in Peace; and for the Reasons now assigned amongst ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, <hi>They humbly besought him, that he would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to put the</hi> Tower <hi>of</hi> London, <hi>and the Militia, into the Hands of such Persons, as should be recommended unto him by both Houses of Parliament.</hi> The King seemed to comply herein, and by his Answer promised them, <hi>That the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia should be put into such Hands, as they should approve of, or recommend to him;</hi> hereupon <hi>both Houses</hi> nominated Persons of the greatest Honour, as fit for that Trust. I shall give you the Names of some of them; The Earls of <hi>Holland, Rutland, Bedford, Bullingbrook, Salisbury, War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, Pembrook, Leicester, Stamford, Essex, Clare, Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland, Lincoln, Suffolk,</hi> &amp;c. Lords, <hi>Paget, North, Strange, Roberts, Grey</hi> of <hi>Werk, Chandois, Dacres, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deville, Wharton, Spencer, Brook, Herbert, Fielding, Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleton, Lord Keeper,</hi> &amp;c. Men Eminent in all Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Honour and Sufficiency were recommended for several <hi>Counties,</hi> and the King was desired to agree there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, <hi>as he had promised;</hi> upon his delaying to give a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Answer, they again Petition, setting forth, That <hi>nothing could enable them to suppress the</hi> Rebellion <hi>in</hi> Ireland, <hi>and secure</hi> England, <hi>but the granting of their Humble Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which they find so absolutely necessary for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of the King and Common-wealth, that <hi>the Laws of God and Man injoin them to see it put in Execution.</hi> They followed him to <hi>Theobalds,</hi> and his several removes to <hi>York,</hi> but he having <hi>Abdicated</hi> the <hi>Parliament,</hi> and being deaf <hi>to all their Importunities,</hi> they declared, <hi>That there had been of late a most desperate Design upon the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which they had just cause to believe was an effect of the</hi> Bloody Councels <hi>of</hi> Papists, <hi>and other evil</hi> affected Persons, <hi>who had already raised a</hi> Rebellion <hi>in</hi> Ireland, <hi>and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of many Discoveries, They could not but fear they would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, not only to stir up the like</hi> Rebellion <hi>and</hi> Insurrection <hi>in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:37493:25"/>
this Kingdom,</hi> but also to back them with <hi>Forces from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad;</hi> and thereupon, <hi>both Houses</hi> made an <hi>Ordinance</hi> for the <hi>ordering of the Militia of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Wales, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing an urgent and inevitable necessity for putting His Majesties Subjects in a posture of Defence for the Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of both His Majesty and his People; and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, <hi>That in this Case of extream danger, and of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Refusal, the Ordinance agreed to by both Houses for the Militia, doth oblige the People, and</hi> ought to be obeyed <hi>by the Fundamental Laws of this Kingdom.</hi> They further a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that time Resolved, <hi>That the King's Absence so far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from his Parliament, was not only an</hi> Obstruction, <hi>but might be a</hi> Destruction <hi>to the Affairs of</hi> Ireland.</p>
            <p>These (and many other) Reasons that may, with the greatest ease be given, 'tis notoriously manifest, That King <hi>Charles</hi> began, and carryed on, that <hi>Bloody Civil War</hi> against his poor Subjects without the <hi>least Colour of Reason and Iustice,</hi> for which wicked Acts, God justly suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him to <hi>be brought to that shameful and untimely End.</hi> This King studdying and endeavouring by all ways imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as he lived without the Love, so he died without the Lamentation of most People, but those Villains, that had been large instruments, in bringing him, and his People, into that miserable War and Division.</p>
            <p n="25">25. That after he had taken God to Witness of his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diness to Treat at <hi>Uxbridge</hi> with the <hi>Parliament</hi> for avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Blood-shed (as pretended) he took the advantage of a Mist, the fittest Weather for <hi>Deceit</hi> and <hi>Treachery,</hi> and followed at the Heels, those <hi>Messengers</hi> of <hi>Peace,</hi> with a Train of <hi>Covert War,</hi> and with a Bloody surprise falls on the Parliaments secure Forces, which lay Quartering at <hi>Brentford,</hi> in the thoughts and expectation of a Treaty.</p>
            <p>He gives his Reason why he seemed for <hi>Peace,</hi> in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to his Queen, which was, That She must know as a certain <hi>Truth,</hi> That all, <hi>even his Party, are strongly impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:37493:26"/>
for a Peace, which oblidged him so much the more to shew on all occasions his Intentions to Peace; but tells her,</hi> no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Death shall make him do any thing unworthy of her Love. An excellent Resolution no doubt, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the <hi>Protestant Religion,</hi> made to his <hi>Popish Queen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the very instant of this <hi>Treaty,</hi> which was in 1644. the King used all imaginable meams to bring not only <hi>Foreign Forces,</hi> but the <hi>Irish Cut Throats,</hi> against the <hi>Parliament.</hi> To clear up this point, and also to shew how insincere he was in his <hi>pretended Intentions of Peace,</hi> I will briefly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent his <hi>Underhand Transactions,</hi> as well with <hi>Foreign Princes,</hi> as those <hi>Rebels;</hi> and in the first place, I shall take notice of some passages between <hi>Him</hi> and the <hi>Queen,</hi> in relation to this, and other Treaties.</p>
            <p>In a Letter to <hi>Her</hi> of <hi>January 9th.</hi> 1644. he Writes thus: The <hi>Scots</hi> Commissioners have sent to me to send a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> to their General Assembly, <hi>Which I am resolved not to do,</hi> but to the end of <hi>making some use of this occasion,</hi> by sending an honest Man to <hi>London,</hi> and that I may have the more time for a handsome Negative, I have demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Pasport for <hi>Phil. Warwick,</hi> by whom to return my Answer.</p>
            <p>At another time the same Month <hi>He</hi> tells <hi>Her,</hi> That <hi>as for my calling those a</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">He had agree to Treat with them as a Parliament, the <hi>Queen</hi> upbraided him for so doing, and he thus vindicates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</note> 
               <hi>Parliament, if there had been but</hi> Two <hi>of my Opinion, I had not done it; the calling did no ways acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge them to be a Parliament, upon which condition and construction I did it, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly it is registred in the Council Books.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing is more evident, than that the King was steered by the <hi>Queen's Council,</hi> in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this <hi>Uxbridge</hi> Treaty, and that which is call'd the Church of <hi>England <hi>[The Bishops]</hi>
               </hi> was greatly her care. By Letter in <hi>January</hi> 1644. before the beginning of that <hi>Treaty, She instructs him not to abandon those who have served
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37493:26"/>
him, lest they forsake him in his need; that</hi> She <hi>hopes he will have a care of her, and her Religion; that in Her Majesties Opinion,</hi> Religion should be the last thing upon which he should Treat; <hi>for if he do agree upon strickness against the Catholicks, it would discourage them to serve him, and if after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards there should be no Peace, he could never expect succours from</hi> Ireland, <hi>or any other</hi> Catholick Prince.</p>
            <p>In another of her Letters, we find her writing thus: <hi>January 17. 1644. It comforts me much to see the Treaty shall be at</hi> Uxbridge.—<hi>I received Yesterday Letters from the Duke of</hi> Lorrain, <hi>who sends me word, if his service be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to you, he will bring 10000 Men.—Above all, have a care not to abandon those who have served you, as well the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, as the poor Catholicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the King's Letters to the Queen in <hi>February,</hi> when the Treaty at <hi>Uxbridge</hi> was depending, <hi>He Stiles the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> Unreasonable, Stubborn, Perfidious Rebels, pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses her to hasten all possible Assistance to him, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that of the Duke of <hi>Lorrain.</hi> He tells her, That, the <hi>limitted days</hi> for treating are now almost expired, without the least Agreement upon any one Article, wherefore I send for enlargement of days, <hi>That the whole Treaty may be laid open to the whole World,</hi> and <hi>I assure thee, thou needst not doubt the Issue of this Treaty;</hi> for my <hi>Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners</hi> are so well chosen, (though I say it) that they will neither be Threatned nor Disputed from the Grounds I have given them, which <hi>(upon my Word) Is according to the little Note thou so well remembers.</hi>—Be confident, that in making Peace, I shall ever shew my <hi>Constancy in adhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Bishops, and all our Friends,</hi> (which could be meant of no other than the Catholicks; for the Queen in her Letter before mentioned, had given him Charge of both together) and not forget to put a short Period to this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Parliament.</p>

We find in another Letter, Dated the <hi>5th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing himself in these Words: <hi>I have thought of one means more to furnish Thee with my assistance, than hitherto thou hast had;</hi> it is, <hi>That I give Thee power to promise in my Name, that I will</hi>

               <hi>take away all the Penal Laws against the Roman Catholicks in</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as soon as God shall enable me to do it.</p>
            <p>In relation to <hi>Ireland,</hi> he wrote to the Marquess of <hi>Ormond</hi> to this Effect, <hi>Jan.</hi> 7.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Rebells</hi> here have agreed to <hi>Treat, and most assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one of the first</hi> and chiefest <hi>Articles</hi> they will insist on, will be, <hi>To continue the</hi> Irish <hi>War,</hi> which is a <hi>Point <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

            <p>
               <hi>Not doubting of a Peace,</hi> I must again remember you, <hi>to press the Irish</hi> for their speedy Assistance to Me here, and their Friends in <hi>Scotland.—I desire</hi> that the <hi>Irish</hi> would send as great a Body as they can, to Land about <hi>Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, which will put those</hi> Northern <hi>Counties in a brave Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the <hi>14th.

Another Letter to <hi>Her</hi> of the <hi>20th.</hi> of <hi>March,</hi> hath this Expression: <hi>I find that thou much mistakes me concerning</hi> Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, <hi>I desire nothing more than a Peace there, and ever for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid thy Commerce there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By another Letter, he commanded <hi>Ormond</hi> to <hi>Dispatch the</hi> Irish <hi>Peace out of hand,</hi> and thereby promises, that the <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> against the Roman Catholicks, <hi>Shall not be put in Execution:</hi> The <hi>Peace</hi> being made, and that when the <hi>Irish</hi> give him that Assistance which they have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for the suppression of this <hi>Rebellion,</hi> then he would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to the Repeal of them by a Law; and Concludes, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending to him again, the speedy dispatch of the Peace of</hi> Ireland.</p>
            <p>Another Letter to <hi>Ormond,</hi> upon the <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>February</hi> 1644. was, <hi>That he thought himself bound in Conscience, not to lose that assistance which he might hope from his</hi> Irish Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, <hi>for such scruples as in a less pressing condition might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably be struck at by him, and therefore Commanded him to conclude a Peace with the</hi> Irish whatever it cost; <hi>so that his Protestant Subjects there might be secured, and his Regal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority preserved.—If the present taking away the <hi>Penal Laws</hi> against Papists will do it</hi> (said he) <hi>I shall not think it a hard Bargin, so that freely and vigourously they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage themselves in my Assistance against my</hi> Rebells <hi>of</hi> England <hi>and</hi> Scotland, <hi>for which no Conditions can be too hard, not being against Conscience or Honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By another Letter to the Marquess of <hi>Ormond,</hi> in the same Month, he Writes thus: <hi>Now again, I cannot but men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the necessity of hastning the</hi> Irish Peace, <hi>for which, I hope, you are already furnished by Me, with Materials sufficient.</hi> But in case (against all Expectation and Reason) <hi>Peace cannot be had upon those Terms, you must not by any means fall to a New Rupture with them, but continue the Cessation.</hi>

                           <hi>THE</hi> Grief <hi>which obliges us to fill the Ears of Your Majesty with our</hi> Cries, <hi>and to Reiterate them so often, ought to be extream to the last</hi> Degree. <hi>Behold us now, Sir, prostrate at your Feet, to Wash them with</hi> our Tears, <hi>and God Almighty Grant, that we do not in a little time, come to</hi> Sigh <hi>out our</hi> last Breath, <hi>with the News of the</hi> Desolation <hi>of our</hi> City. <hi>We know not how, Sir, to conceal it from</hi> You, <hi>the Sence we have of Her being at Her</hi> last Gasp, <hi>puts us into Despair;</hi> seeing the Succours which Your Majesty hath made us hope would be ready, <hi>hath been deferred from</hi> day to day for many Weeks together.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>SIR, the City of</hi> Rochell <hi>did by us beg of</hi> You, <hi>with all the Humility they were capable of Expressing, to</hi> receive them <hi>into your</hi> Protection, and You as Solemnly agreed to it; <hi>since they have had at divers times,</hi> all the Assurances possible, <hi>as well from your</hi> own Month, <hi>as</hi> under the Hand of Your Majesty, <hi>that you would never</hi> abandon them: <hi>Whereupon by a</hi> Miracle of Constancy, <hi>they have held out hitherto firm a</hi> whole Year, <hi>contending with the Horrours of a most gastly</hi> Famine, <hi>that thereby they might give</hi> Your Majesty, <hi>full leisure to send them the Succours You were graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously pleased to</hi> promise them; <hi>and thus constant and unshaken were</hi> they, <hi>even when all</hi> Europe, <hi>believed they ought to have despaired, in that after they had</hi> Relief, <hi>as they</hi> thought seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days <hi>in</hi> their sight, it returned without effecting, <hi>or</hi> attempting <hi>any thing.

thence taken occasion to make them divers</hi> Overtures <hi>of</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, <hi>which their</hi> extream Necessities <hi>seemed to Counsel them to</hi> hearken unto; <hi>yet they chose rather to run the</hi> Hazzard <hi>of their utter</hi> Destruction, <hi>then to be wanting in the least to the</hi> Promises <hi>we had</hi> Sworn <hi>for them to</hi> Your Majesty, <hi>or to shew they had the least Diffidence of your</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>After all this,</hi> Sir, <hi>shall it be</hi> Recorded <hi>in the History of</hi> Your Reign; <hi>That they</hi> perished in your Hands <hi>without having reaped any other</hi> Fruit <hi>of the Good Will Your</hi> Majesty <hi>hath professed</hi> towards them, <hi>and of the Assurance they have therein relied upon; then the rendring them irrecountable to their King, from whom otherwise they might have hoped to have found Grace and Favour!</hi>

                           <hi>Pardon,</hi> Sir, <hi>this, from a People who</hi> see themselves <hi>upon the very</hi> Threshold <hi>of their Sepulchers, if they cannot avoid</hi> Sighs <hi>which may seem undecent in your</hi> Royal Presence. <hi>It is common for those that are</hi> near their End, <hi>to finish their</hi> Lives <hi>with</hi> Groans. <hi>In the</hi> Name of God, <hi>Sir, so long as there remains any</hi> Breath in us, <hi>and before we do quite</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, <hi>command your</hi> Succours <hi>to hasten to our Assistance; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that diligence be yet used, we will remain</hi> Caution <hi>to Your Majesty with the</hi> Peril <hi>of our</hi> Heads, <hi>that they will ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive time enough to</hi> save us. <hi>As to the Impossibilities that some may be willing to find in it, permit us to tell You freely,</hi> Sir, <hi>That those are only founded, either in their fear, or their very little Affection for us; and that besides the Report which some Persons unsuspected, have made to</hi> Your Majesty, <hi>we beseech You, be You judge, whether our</hi> City, <hi>which is within sight of the</hi> Digne <hi>and</hi> Pallisade, <hi>and carriage of her Cannon, would send time after time to implore</hi> Your Assistance, <hi>if they thought it would be unprofitable to them, and if having every day offers of Capitulation upon advantagious Conditions, if they would hearken to it for themselves alone, they would be so imprudent to neglect the opportunity. But we are ready if
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:37493:30"/>
it shall please Your Majesty to permit it, to take upon us the first Risques and Hazzards of the Execution, to the end that we may be justified to all the World in the sincerity of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding; and that it may not be imputed to us, that we are prodigal of the Blood of Your Majesties Subjects to ill purpose, to be sparing of our own: No,</hi> Sir, <hi>there is no such impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as</hi> what some would pretend.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The only Cause of our Fears, comes from the</hi> slowness and continual neglects <hi>from one Day to another, and one Week to another, which makes our hopes Recoil. After the Return of your Fleet, we comforted our selves with the</hi> Promise <hi>that was made us by</hi> Your Majesty, <hi>That it should depart again within</hi> fifteen days; <hi>but when after</hi> twenty <hi>were</hi> past, <hi>there were added</hi> fourteen <hi>more to them: And after that, we found divers other</hi> neglectful Disappointments, <hi>that have now</hi> taken up two Months compleat; <hi>Good God,</hi> Sir, How long has that time seemed to those miserable Wretches that have not Bread! <hi>We know very well the good Inclinations Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty hath for our Weal; as also we have had most certain Proofs of the Duke of</hi> Buckingham, <hi>your high Admiral, his passionate applying himself for us, as also the same of the Lords of your Council; but shall we not be excusable, if seeing the Effects thereof crossed, by all these Delays? We entertain Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies, that Your Majesty is not</hi> well served, <hi>and that there is some secret Hand, which clandestingly obstructs, that which the Zeal of others endeavours to advance. It is ordinary for Men in misery to be suspicious, and possibly here we are not injurious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly so; indeed we do not know any Person on whom to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine our Diffidence, nor have we any intention to call to mind any thing that is past; may that,</hi> Sir, <hi>remain</hi> buried <hi>in Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Oblivion, and for the future at least, let those to whom Your Majesty shall give your Commands, answer so well your kindness to us, with their Affection and Diligence, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any</hi> farther delay, <hi>your Fleet may</hi> put to Sea, <hi>and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us yet out of the</hi> Cruel Arms of Death.</p>

He went Post for <hi>England,</hi> to give an Account of it to his Master. After the <hi>English</hi> Fleet had been a Month in the Road without doing <hi>any thing,</hi> and without sending the <hi>Besieged Army</hi> any manner of Victuals, which were on Board: Then the poor <hi>Rochellers,</hi> who were not able to hold <hi>out no longer,</hi> saw plainly how they were Abused and Betrayed; so
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:37493:32"/>
hereupon they resolved (no more to expect the <hi>Illusory Succours</hi> of the <hi>English,</hi> and the vain Hopes of assistance from them, to deliver up the City; and whilst the Lord <hi>Montague</hi> was going for <hi>England,</hi> and to return to the <hi>French</hi> King with the Effects of his Negotiation, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve to throw themselves into the Arms of the King, their Sovereign, in hopes after all, by their Repentance for their so long Obstinancy, to obtain his Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.</p>
            <p>And about the end of <hi>October,</hi> their Agreement was made among themselves, and Signed: And the first of <hi>November,</hi> the King made Entrance into <hi>Rochell,</hi> where he found the Inhabitants more like <hi>Skeletons,</hi> than <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>Women.</hi> And this King had more compassion than the <hi>hard-hearted Oppressor of</hi> England, for he was so sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly touched with that sad Sight, that he <hi>could not refrain letting fall some Tears.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 5th. of <hi>November,</hi> the <hi>English</hi> Fleet, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been a Month and six days in the Road, and seen from thence the Reductien of <hi>Rochell</hi> to the Obedience of the King, set sail, carrying a long with them a great par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>French,</hi> as well as Victuals, they had brought from <hi>England.</hi>

            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="2">2. In denying them (the undoubted Right of all Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects) to Petition for Redress of their Grievances.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In dissolving their Synod and Parliament, Burning the Pacification made with them, by the <hi>Hangman's</hi> hands;
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:37493:32"/>
and Imprisoning the Lord's sent by them, to Petition him to perform his Sollemn Promises, and Redress their Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In levying <hi>Doctrines</hi> against them, and raising a <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War,</hi> to justify himself in the Violation of their <hi>Laws.</hi> A <hi>Civil War</hi> it was, said the Great Lord <hi>Digby,</hi> seeing we are of the same <hi>Religion,</hi> and under the same King. And</p>
            <p n="5">5. In attempting to make use of the <hi>Love and Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of the <hi>English,</hi> to Enslave and Ruin the <hi>Scotish</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is not improper here to observe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Scotish</hi> Covenant was not a new <hi>Invention or Innovation,</hi> but Established by the Law of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and taken by King <hi>James</hi> the First, seventy Years before King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second took it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Clergymen</hi> in Conjunction with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists, abetted and assisted this <hi>T—</hi>in the violation of the <hi>Laws,</hi> when the Bulk of the <hi>Nobility, Gentry,</hi> and <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of</hi> England, appeared undauntedly in Defence of the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That <hi>Popery</hi> hath greatly spred in <hi>Scotland</hi> ever since <hi>Laud</hi>'s Superstition was introduced here, the Number of Papists not exceeding 600. And therefore <hi>Presbetery</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now restored by a Law, it may be reasonably hoped, that it will reduce many who have been deluded into that <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That <hi>Princes</hi> are not always to trust to the <hi>Insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> and <hi>Suggestions</hi> of <hi>Scotish</hi> Bishops; seeing that when they instigated King <hi>Charles</hi> I. <hi>to Dissolve the Synod and Parliament,</hi> he was seduced by them into a belief, That the <hi>Scotish Covenanteers</hi> were a contemptible Number, and their Party in <hi>Scotland</hi> was sufficient to deal with them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That the <hi>Scots</hi> were not <hi>Rebells</hi> in taking Arms to Assert their <hi>Rights,</hi> and Vindicate the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Liberties</hi> of their <hi>Countrey.</hi>

That the horrid Imposition of <hi>Laud</hi>'s <hi>Popish Liturgy,</hi> did occasion the Troubles of <hi>Scotland,</hi> is very manifest from Dr. <hi>Burnet's</hi> (now Bishop of <hi>Salisbury)</hi> his Memoirs of Duke <hi>Hamilton,</hi> for he saith, <hi>Page 30.
