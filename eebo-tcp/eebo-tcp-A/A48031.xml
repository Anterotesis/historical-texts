            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>GREAT SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHen I began to write this Dedication,
my hand shook, a fear possest me, and I
trembled; my Pen fell from me, and
my whole frame grew disorder'd, as if
blasted with some sudden upstart Comet. Such Awe
and Reverence waits on Dignity, that I now find it fit
for me to wish, I had been refused the honour of my
Dedication, rather than undertake a task so much too
great for me. How shall I excuse this bold and saucie
fault? How shall my mean unworthy pen, render you
your Attributes? Now I find presumption is a sin in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.
I have given my self a wound beyond the cure of
common men: Heal me then, Great Sir, for where
Princes touch, the Cure is infallible. And now since
you so graciously have received my Farriar, who dares
say he is no Physician? When you vouch safe to call him
Doctor, he has Commenced, and from your Mouth he has
taken his Degree; for what you say, is, and ought to be:
such a power is due to you from the Greatness of your
Blood: I, and my abject Muse had perisht but for you;
and in such distress, whither should we flee for shelter,
but to him that has power to spread his wings and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb facs="tcp:61724:3"/>
us? and you have done it generously: Yet am I
not to wonder at this Vertue in you, since your high
Birth can do no less for you than to make you good, and
you are so: and may that Goodness and Humility, which
so early appears in you, increase to a full perfection:
may your Vertues prove as beautiful as your person;
may they still indeavour to out-vie each other, yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
obtain, but still walk hand in hand, till your Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
in you be reverenc'd by all Mankind, and your love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Person honoured by all Women, and so may you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
to a long and happy life. But I need not wish
this, nor the world doubt it; for already you're possest
of all those Vertues, that men hereafter may reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lly
expect from you: for being supported with Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
of one side, and with so admired and beautiful a
Mother on the other, besides her great and honourable
Birth, on such sure foundations, you cannot fail our
hopes, and that you never may, shall be for ever the
prayers of</p>

            <head>The Epistle to the Reader.</head>
            <p>GEntle Reader, (for so most Epistles begin) being
conscious of my own weakness (for so they go
on) I let thee know my own modesty had kept
me from the Press, but for the importunity of
friends, (and so they make an end.)</p>
            <p>By this you see, Poetry consists more of Fancie than truth;
so do the Poets too, or else, why should they seem ashamed
to come into the Press? when I know their Bowels languish
within them till they are there: Vain-glory being the chief
ingredient, that makes up the spirit of Poetry, and the
grand Inducement that puts us all in print. There is a kind
of Charm in Poetry, 'tis like Tobacco and Chymistry; for if
you once take the one, and undertake the other, you are fixt
to the free-hold never to be parted. So fares it with the
Dablers in the Dew of <hi>Pernassus:</hi> no revilings, no shameful
reproaches can discourage us; still we write on, still we
are fixt to the free-hold. I have observed, how much more
precious to a Poet the Issue of his Brain is than that of his
Loyns: for I have known them bury Children without grief
or trouble; but the Issue of their Brain is so dear and tender
to them, that if you go about to perswade them but to cut
a Play or Poem shorter, they are so concern'd, that every Line
you cut is valued at a Joynt, and every Speech a Limb lopt
off Without doubt there is a kind of madness in Poetry, or
else how can a man be so vainly possest as to think his own
works exceed all other mens? That there are such men is but
too true; for, I my self have thought so of my own Poetry:
and when I that am so mean an under-shurb do prove so vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
mad, the tall Cedars sure must needs be shaken with out-ragious
fits; and in those fits they write raptures, and fly to
<pb facs="tcp:61724:4"/>
the Skies, and get among the Gods, and makes such work,
that you would swear they'r all breaking up School, and
coming down amongst us. For my part, I wonder they have
not come all this while, I'm sure they have been sufficiently
provoked. I thank my incapacity I am not so far gone in
Poetry as to arrive at those fits; yet I have this to say, that I have
had my ends upon Poetry, and not Poetry upon me: for if
Poetry had gained its ends on me, it had made me mad; but
that I having my ends on it, appears in my getting money by
it, which was shewn plentifully on my Poets days; but that
I thank my friends for, and not the desert of my Plays: and I
wish, Reader, that you may prove as kind to the Printer, as
you were to me, when you were a hearer; and that my Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riar
may prove as good a servant to him, as formerly to me,
who am, Reader,</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Isa.</speaker>
               <p>But he is a famous Physician of <hi>Padua,</hi> and has retired

            <sp>
               <speaker>Soft.</speaker>
               <p>Then he is a fool and no Physician; for the wise Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors

               <p>Why you must know Sir, he exceeds the World for

               <speaker>Isa.</speaker>
               <p>Why, Sir, he is easily spoke with, but you'll find it
wonderful difficult to get him to a Patient; neither gold,
complement, nor other fair usage could ever yet work upon
him, and yet there is a way to gain him.</p>

               <speaker>Isa.</speaker>
               <p>A way that you'll think strange, but very true: he could

               <speaker>Isa.</speaker>
               <p>I marry, Sir, that will do it, and nothing else i'th'

               <p>Truly, Sir, but two days since he brought a mad wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

               <p>Sir, in short, we know you to be a famous Doctor of
<hi>Padua,</hi> and we wish you would leave these abject thoughts of
being a Farrier, and follow your own worthy profession of
Physick.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>Now you provoke me, Sir: do you think a Farrier in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
to a Physician? he is the son of a Mare that thinks a
horse has not as many diseases as a man.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Soft.</speaker>
               <p>And he is the son of a whore that thinks a Squire has
not as many diseases as a Horse: and Friend, take heed how
you make comparisons, for you'll have all the Squires i'th'
Country about your ears upon this score.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>Country Squires I shall deal well enough with, and I
shall justifie a Horse has more diseases than a Squire, and take
the honour of Knighthood to help you.</p>

               <p>Hold, hold, Sir, the latter end of a Squires argument
is still quarrelling.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Soft.</speaker>
               <p>Without quarrelling then I'll prove, that Squire and

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>I, with the diseases of their own, that Nature never

               <p>And first, I prove a Squiress, that is, a woman, may be

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>And I answer, a horse cannot speak, set that against
that: and yet I'll undertake to make a horse speak before
you shall make a woman dumb, Sir.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>Because, Sir, a woman has no tongue, they'r tongues in

            <sp>

I will first take your Mistress by the pulse, and look up grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
at the sieling all the while; then ask what she took last,
and when she'd a stool, and there's half a Doctors work; then
I'll prescribe something that will neither do hurt nor good, so
leave her to luck, and there's the other half of the Doctor;
then (to amuze the people) I'll give her the powder of a dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Dock-leaf, with Apothecaries hard name to it; and if that
will not mend her, I'll give her a drench, for women have stur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
stomachs, and why not as strong of constitution as Horses?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr.</speaker>
               <p>Why, a drench is a potion, and a potion is a drench;
only the distinction is, when you put it into a horn, then 'tis
a drench for a horse; and when you put it into a vial-glass,
'tis a potion for a man; nay, I'll discover all their cheats.</p>

               <p>Sir, I have brought my Daughter, and I beseech your

            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>Hold, Sir, people do not die so easily without the help

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>Why, Sir, according to the sence of <hi>Aristotle.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:61724:15"/>
               <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristotle</hi> was a Philosopher, Sir.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>I, and a Physician too, I know what I say. Heart! I
had like to have been gravel'd; I say again, according to the
sence of <hi>Hippocrates.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
               <p>I marry, Sir, he was a Physician indeed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>I, and a Philosopher too, therefore no matter which

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jar.</speaker>
               <p>By my troth I think so too.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>And therefore as I said at first, according to the sence
of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> women are dumb because they cannot speak.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nur.</speaker>
               <p>A sweet Doctor, I always thought so indeed.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Jar.</speaker>
               <p>Have you tasted of his sweetness you quean?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nur.</speaker>
               <p>Not yet, but I hope I shall do, you rogue.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
               <p>But, Sir, are there many reasons for dumbness in a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>Several, Sir: a woman may be dumb, when she has no
mind to speak, and she may speak when no body has a mind to
hear her; this is Natural Philosophy now.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
               <p>Why, you speak, as if it were sullenness in their Sex,
and not a defect in Nature, nor other accident.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>I do so: in some Romance perhaps you may have
read of a womans being dumb; but sure no man seriously e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
heard of a woman that could not speak.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nur.</speaker>
               <p>He is i'th' right i'faith; this is the Doctor of Doctors

               <p>Again the Doctor? I would he were hung about thy neck.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Nur.</speaker>
               <p>By my troth, so would I to determine thy jealousie.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
               <p>But pray you, Sir, why should you think a woman
cannot be dumb?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>Why, Sir, your men that has indeavour'd to find out
the perpetual motion, has come near it, I confess, with
their Clocks and Pendulas: but <hi>Aristotle</hi> says, Fix a Dya<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

there, let them never hope to find it; and if it be there, 'tis

               <p>Why, you must know, her dumbness may proceed

               <p>I grant you, Sir; but we of <hi>Padua</hi> call a lameness in
the tongue the string-holt, from that very string which you
call the greedie worm: (A pox on me, I shall betray my self a

proceeds from Stomachous fumigations which proceed from

               <p>I'm sorry for't, Sir; did you but know the sweet

               <p>Sir, I like your discourse well, only where you say,
the heart lyes on the right-side, and the liver on the left;
which is contrary to all Anatomists I ever heard of.</p>

               <p>How shall I answer this? pox on him, he makes me
sweat. Why, Sir, it is true, that in time of health the heart
lyes on the left-side, and in most diseases too: but in dumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the heart by some strong passion being turned, and
whirled to the right-side, till by art it be returned and whirled
back to the left, neither man nor woman can possibly speak;
and that is the positive cause of all dumbness.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>O, there's the point; why, there be several ways to

with too much studie, have likely a worm in our heads,
and when that worms wrigles, the mind alters; so that we
change our fashions as much in Physick, as the Court and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
do their cloaths: But come, get my Patient to her bed, and
when she's warm, give her a lusty dose of Sops and Wine.</p>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>The better, Sir; for when people are drunk, they
are apt to speak their minds: I work by Natural Causes: you
see by the vertue of Cakes and Wine how women tattle at a
Gossoping; no man ever knew a dumb woman at a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stening

have given me such strong reasons to think so well on't, that
I believe none rail at it, but such as would be glad of the
imployment themselves: And, Sir, as you call it, I will help
you to the speech of her, or befriend you, or pimp for

               <p>Why, faith you are as well qualified for
an Apothecary, as I am for a Physician; you have trusted me
with your heart, and now I'l trust you with my simplicity: I
am no Doctor, but was forc'd to own being one; why, and
how, I'l tell you hereafter; but having served a Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank,
that and my great share in impudence, has made me
famous.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lea.</speaker>
               <p>Is it possible impudence should have such vertuous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, yet some men rail at impudence, and speak it vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
when the Jest is, they that rail most at it, make most
use on't: 'tis doubtless the greatest blessing in the world,
and most men do their business by it.</p>

               <speaker>Lea.</speaker>
               <p>But if you be so ignorant, sure impudence should not
bear you out, especially in this learned Profession.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>O, Sir, it is the securest cloak for ignorance of all
Arts: other Professions are lyable to miscarriages and questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable:
but the Physician may kill from the Fool to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator,
from the Beggar to the Bloud-Royal, and ne'er be call'd
in question; the dead was never so uncivil yet, as to come
out o'th' other world to complain of the Physician.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>It needs not, for the great studie of Physick is come
to nothing now but letting Bloud; and it falls out well for
me that am a down-right Farrier.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lea.</speaker>
               <p>How, is your real Profession a Farrier?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>Yes faith, and with the same Fleams I let Horses
bloud<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I use my Patients to; and the horses drench is the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
I give to men, and I cure more than I kill; so that I am
the only Doctor that has found out horse and man to be of
one constitution.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lea.</speaker>

               <p>O, Sir, 'tis Alamode <hi>Paris;</hi> if your corn does but
ake against rain, what says the Doctor? Let him bloud: Nay,
if you be troubled in Conscience, they'l let you bloud for that

            <sp>

I'l justifie it, and a raskal, and I'll maintain it; yet, Sir, if you

            <sp>
               <speaker>Soft.</speaker>
               <p>Why, I ran after him, got my sword, and came ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably
to him again, and I drive him honourably round
the field; and all that while his boy got behind me disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably,

cudgel'd you behind, how came you thus black and blew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Why, he beat my head and shoulders so divelishly,
that it came quite through to th' other side, that my face is all
over <hi>Coventrey</hi> blew: therefore good Doctor, report I am your
patient and desperately wounded, and there's twenty pound,
and I'l have a Red Scarf with a great fringe about my arm,
methinks that looks valiantly; and here is a sword has been
up to the hilts in bloud; and if you hear <hi>Leander</hi> be kill'd,
not a word who did it on your lives.</p>

               <speaker>Lea.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, to tell you true, we came just now from dressing of
<hi>Leanders</hi> wounds; and to be plain with you, if you did it,
your life is in danger; for he cannot live above two dressings

over; go to your Daughter whilst we consult a little: we
must press to have her to your house to cure her.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>And that she may appear the more mad, let her tear
all her cloaths off; for a mad woman naked has such antick
temptations.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Sir, he must feel if he can discover of what side her
heart lies: I'l keep him in discourse the mean while.</p>

               <p>Love is certainly the cause on't, and for her cure, this

               <p>NO dear cousin, I was not dumb, nor am I mad, I
have trusted you with my love, and in that my
life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nib.</speaker>
               <p>Dear Cousin, doubt me not; when I am false to you,
may I miscarry in my own Amours: but pray you Couz, how
came you by this lover <hi>Leander?</hi> for none o'th' house knows
him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Olin.</speaker>
               <p>Truly Couz I never saw him but at Church.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nib.</speaker>
               <p>A very good place to make love in.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Olin.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed, I have found it so, the first time I saw him
was six Pews from me, the next time he sate within two, and
there he warm'd my heart: the next after he sate i'th' same
Pew with me; and 'twas so ordered betwixt him and the Pew-keeper,
that none sate with us, and there we loved, and there
we plighted troth.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nib.</speaker>
               <p>I find a Pew-keeper is a worthy friend to love, and for
sixpence you may sit with whom you please, and court whom
you please i'th' Church: It was handsomely contrived of
your Lover though, to come with the Doctor as his Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary;
but what made him perswade you to counterfeit
madness?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Olin.</speaker>
               <p>He has a design in't but had not time to tell me; my
father has turn'd the Doctor off you see, therefore Couz you
must go to him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nib.</speaker>
               <p>He'l find some stratagem to see you again, fear not; if
not, I'l go to him: but come Couz, now lets laugh at the
Duel, that the Squires foot-boy told us of his Master.</p>

               <p>No doubt on't: your father's bringing of him in to woo
you again; fall to your madness, and let me alone to dispose
of the Squire; I'l have him drawn up with an Engine, and
there he shall hang i'th' Air in a Cardle till you'r married, or

               <p>I wooed her with all the fashionable questions of the

at me; then I askt her if she would come the caster, and I'd
cover her: no man could say fairer to his Mistriss I think;
then I askt her if she could drink Burgundy, and seal Bonds,
pay the price of a Chine of Beef, for a dish of French Trotters;
and that's all I said to her.</p>

               <speaker>Othen.</speaker>
               <p>Now Doctor give me leave to be merry with you,
I studyed physick, and should have profest it, and an old Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor
gave me some rules for a young Doctor to observe.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Othen.</speaker>
               <p>First, have always a grave busie face, as if you were
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:61724:38"/>
still in great care for some great persons health, though your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations
truly known are only imployed in casting where to
eat that day: Secondly, be sure you keep the Church strictly
on Sundays; and i'th' middle o'th' Sermon, let your man
fetch you out in great haste, as if 'twere to a Patient; then
have your small Agent to hire forty Porters a day to leave
impertinent notes at your house, and let them knock as if
'twere upon life and death; these things the world takes notice
of, and you'r cryed up for a man of great practice, and there's
your business done.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Othen.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, I have more, be sure you ingratiate your self
with the Bauds, pretending to cure the poor Whores for cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
that brings good private work after it. Strike in with
Mid-wives too, that you may be in the councel for by-blows,
that secures a Patient during life; and with Apothecaries,
and Nurse-keepers go snips; but above all acquire great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence,
lest you be out of countenance at your own miscar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>I am so well stockt with that, that if ever impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
come to be worship'd as a Deity, they'l set me upon a
pedestal for their god.</p>

               <speaker>Lea.</speaker>
               <p>But to our business Doctor, you know we perswaded
the old man that we must say and do all things to humour his
seeming mad daughter, and by that only way she is to be
recover'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>Right, and the old man believes it too.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Lea.</speaker>
               <p>Therefore when we are there, you shall hold the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

manage her madness, my Brother shall marry us to the old
mans face.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>By my troth that would be impudently done indeed;
yet the old Gentleman has now so much confidence in us, that
we may do any thing.</p>

and has ever since continued so; and this he told me would
be the effect of what he then did.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>Most wonderful! what was it he gave her, Sir?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
               <p>Nay, that I know not, but I assure you, he said he
could make her speak, and told me her disease would turn
to madness, and accordingly it has proved so; nevertheless,
Gentlemen, I desire you to joyn with this Learned man, and
consider how to perfect her cure.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>1 Doct.</speaker>
               <p>Why, Sir, you tell us wonders of him; where did
he study?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
               <p>I know not, but he seems to be a great Traveller, for
he talkt of <hi>Tartar Cham,</hi> and of <hi>Padua,</hi> and <hi>Greenland.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <p>
                  <hi>Tartar Cham</hi> and <hi>Green-land?</hi> this must be a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebank

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
               <p>Upon my credit you will not find him so, for he has
seen all Universities, he is but newly come over, and his name
is Doctor <hi>Drench.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Drench?</hi> why that's a fitter name for a Farrier than a

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
               <p>Let his name be as strange as it will, he has also strange

            <sp>
               <speaker>1 Doct.</speaker>
               <p>Why I, for if he be a Chymist, his opinion and

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>2 Doct.</speaker>
               <p>I am, Sir, of your opinion, for I think it <hi>infradignitatem</hi>
to hold consultation with Mountebanks.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>3 Doct.</speaker>

               <speaker>1 Doct.</speaker>
               <p>If he be a Chymist, Sir, he is <hi>eo nomine,</hi> a declared

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>2 Doct.</speaker>
               <p>Right, Sir, <hi>contra principia negantem non est dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tandum;</hi>
he that replys but with submission to <hi>sic dixit Gale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>

            <sp>

               <p>Pardon me Gentlemen, I have known some Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
Physicians learned and rational men; and although not
strict adherers to the Galenical Method, proceed with great
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61724:40"/>
reason, and good success, which, I take it, answers all we can

            <sp>
               <speaker>2 Doct.</speaker>
               <p>I profess I think it as bad as murder to cure out of

               <p>I shall fall into the Farrier. Well, I find, Gentlemen,
you are professed Doctors of Physick, and are met to consult
the health of a distracted Ladie; therefore to the point, and
avoid your canting words, that would stick in a wise mans
throat and choak him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>2 Doct.</speaker>
               <p>But, Sir, 'tis necessary we deliver our selves in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
and learned phrases, when we discourse either of Physick
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61724:41"/>
or Distempers, <hi>In Arte artificialiter loquendum;</hi> and withal,
Sir, 'tis fit that we of the consultation should withdraw.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>No withdrawing, Sir, 'tis not my way, I love per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
concern'd should hear and see what's done, that they may
judge who are doers, and who are talkers; and if you affect
the vain-glory of learned phrases, my Operator <hi>Hurnatio,</hi> and
his man <hi>Stirquilutio</hi> shall dispute you; for with great pains
I have inabled them to argue in all tongues, because they know

            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>I shall only trouble you with one question or two my
self: First, I ask you whether you know the practice of before
behind, behind before?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>2 Doct.</speaker>
               <p>Before behind, behind before? why, that is something
belongs to a horse, a Farrier or a Blacksmith must answer that
question.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>I know where you'd be presently, in some sort 'tis
true that you say; yet in <hi>Italy</hi> both woman and boys have
their before behind, behind before, as well as your horses
have here.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Stir.</speaker>
               <p>Bravely come off Doctor.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>I know not well your way of practice, but the cost
you put the people to in that common disease, call'd the
mourning of the Chine, I do abominate you for.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>3 Doct.</speaker>
               <p>Mourning of the Chine? with your favour, Sir, that
is the disease of a Horse, and the phrase of a Farrier.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>And, Sir, I say again, I call it the mourning of the
Chine, for the word Pox is a phrase of ill manners; and
therefore I think it proper to call it the Pox in a Horse, and
civil to call it the mourning of the Chine in a man.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Stir.</speaker>
               <p>You'l have no need of Latin, Doctor.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>Look you to that Parson: and I must tell you I shall
spoil the benefit you get by that disease; for I'l advise every
man to plant a <hi>Guaicum</hi>-Tree in his Orchard, and a Leaf of
that at any time will cure infallibly, and that's one of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
I will reveal to the world, to spoil the practice of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebanks,
clap Doctors and bill men.</p>

               <speaker>2 Doct.</speaker>
               <p>But will that disease be cured with the Leaf of a

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>I, Sir, as I can order it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>1 Doct.</speaker>
               <p>Pray you, Sir, how will you order it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>Why first, Sir, I will make you a mash.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>3 Doct.</speaker>
               <p>How, Sir, that's a Farriers phrase again, what mean
you by a mash, Sir?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>Tell 'em, tell 'em <hi>Stirquilutio,</hi> and let not me be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to interpret.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Stir.</speaker>
               <p>Why, Sir, the Doctor is so much read in the <hi>Arabian</hi>
Physicians, that he often uses their terms: <hi>Masha</hi> in the <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi>
is what <hi>quinta essentia</hi> is in the Latin.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>Well helpt Parson: you wonder at my phrases, and I
at your want of <hi>Arabick.</hi> Now, Sir, when any man is troubled
with the staggers, we do not cut him and slash him in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
as you do your Horses.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>2 Doct.</speaker>
               <p>Staggers in a man? with your favour, Sir, you have
talkt all this while liker a Farrier than a Physician; and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to think you are one, Sir.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>How shall I get off now?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Stir.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, Sir, he is a Farrier, and an able Farrier too; for
if you be not good Farriers, and good Surgeons too, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
not the name of Doctors.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Hur.</speaker>
               <p>And pray you come to the point concerning our mad

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>I, there's the best tryal of our judgements, therefore
Nurse, run and fetch your young Mistresses water presently.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ger.</speaker>
               <p>I, that the Gentlemen may the better judge what to

child may find comfort from you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>3 Doct.</speaker>
               <p>Sir, you shall be sure of all the aid our Art can
shew.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>And likewise our endeavours, Sir.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>2 Doct.</speaker>
               <p>But, Sir, amongst all signs of sickness or health,
whereby the skilful Physician is led into the knowledge of
the state of the body; two above the rest are most certain,
which are the Pulse and Urin.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:61724:42"/>
               <speaker>3 Doct.</speaker>
               <p>I, whereof the Pulse shews the state of the Heart
and Arteries, and Urin the state of the Liver and Veins.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>2 Doct.</speaker>
               <p>Therefore the question is, whether of these two
severally consider'd, does give the most certain signification.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>Urin, Urin, Urin, which makes me send for her water;
still I say, <hi>Stirquilutio</hi> give 'em reasons, and let not me be
troubl'd.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Stir.</speaker>
               <p>Then I say, <hi>Montanus de excrementis</hi> says.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>I say, give them reasons in their own mother tongue.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Stir.</speaker>
               <p>Then I say, the Urin above the Pulse, gives the most
manifest, certain, and general signification of all diseases, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
with the bloud it is conveyed into all parts of the body;
and from thence returns back again in the Veins, to the Liver
and Vessels of Urin, and so brings is some note of the state and
disposition of all those parts from whence it comes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>3 Doct.</speaker>
               <p>'Tis wonderful that an under-servant to a Doctor
should have this learning.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>2 Doct.</speaker>
               <p>I doubt whether the Master understand so much.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Doct.</speaker>
               <p>Say you so, Sir, I'l be even with you: Parson, I'l tell
that Doctor he is not well, and whilst I feel his Pulse, convey
you this Cow-itch down his neck. Come hither, Sir, I pray

            <l>YOu that are Learn'd, expect honour for it;</l>
            <l>We that are unlearn'd, slight and abhor it:</l>
            <l>The Rich does look with scorn upon the Poor,</l>
            <l>But give no Alms; the Beggar scorns you more.</l>
            <l>Thus does the wretch your wealth disdain; nay worse,</l>
            <l>For each proud look, the Beggar gives a curse:</l>
            <l>But give him Alms, as I believe 'tis rare,</l>
            <l>The Beggar gratefully returns his Pray'r.</l>
            <l>So when the Vnlearn'd, by the learn'd improve,</l>
            <l>They'l give them honour for their learned Love:</l>
            <l>But stead of that, the Vnlearn'd they indite,</l>
            <l>And proudly ask us how we dare to write?</l>
            <l>We humbly answer our Inditement thus,</l>
            <l>If Poetry be Fancie, the right's in us;</l>
            <l>For you with Authors are so deeply read,</l>
            <l>Invention has no room in learned head;</l>
            <l>Borrowing what you read, and Authors citing,</l>
            <l>Is your invention, and your writing.</l>
            <l>Now th' illiterate are for fancie bent,</l>
            <l>Having no learning, they must needs invent.</l>
            <l>Thus Poetry is ours to inherit</l>
            <l>As much as yours with your learned merit;</l>
            <l>For as Quakers preach, we write, by th' spirit.</l>
