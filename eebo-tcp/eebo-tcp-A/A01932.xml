            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The verturous, and generous Spirites of reſolute Gentlemen, vnder-takers of this plantation, haue raiſed their fortunes worthie of honour; and by his Majeſties favour, their vertues rewarded with the titles of Earles, Vice-Countes Lords, Barronets, and Knights, according to their qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and his Majeſties pleaſure.

               <p>The Countrie it is called by the name of Cape Briton, now <hi>New Galloway</hi>: new, not in reſpect of the diſcoverie thereof, which to the judgment of men of knowledge and vnderſtanding is not new, but old; for the much hath been written thereof, yet new, not olde, becauſe of our new vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of that plantation. It is ſituated betwixt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of 45. and 57. an Yland within the Sea, but vpon the maine, ſevered by the diſtance of foure leagues in ſome parts, of two or three at other parts: and at others, leſſe.</p>
               <p>The Yland is in length ſome 120. myles, and in breadth 80. myles or thereby: ſtanding South-eaſt, and North-weſt to <hi>New Scotland</hi>; vvhere the great river <hi>Canada</hi> ingorgeth her ſelfe in the maine Ocean.

               <p>ſenſe, and feeling out of mine owne experience, howe I ſee the eſtate of the Kingdome.</p>
               <p>Then (Worthie Countriemen) let vs lay theſe two things in the ballance, and judge vpon them: whether it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for vs to goe there, where wee may haue to live in in a fruitfull Soyle, and wholeſome, in all commodities abounding to our contentments, beeing onlie a litle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious, and painefull? than to live heere at home as Runnagates, vnanſwerable to GOD, the King, the Lawes, to all reaſon, and conſcience: to bee captivate as ſlaves, and caſt in loathſome Priſons, to ſatiſfie with our perſons, when our goods hath failed vs: and eſpeciallie, when wee haue wronged our beſt and kindeſt friendes, who out of their loves hath engaged themſelves, to be diſtreſſed, and impriſoned for vs, which ſhoulde bee a greater griefe vnto vs, than our owne impriſonments.</p>
               <p>And then ſhall wee diſdaine plantation: which to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe is ſo honourable; to proſecute ſo poſſible: to purchaſe ſo lawfull, and when attained, ſo profitable? No, whoſoever ſhall reaſon againſt the ſame, eſpecially ſuch as are in diſtreſſe, may well bee reputed, either the Baſtard of generoſitie, or the nurſling of ſimplicitie, or the abject of frugalitie: and ſhall either become for ever, the proſtitute of infamie, or conſecrated to perpetuall oblivion: and when hee is dead, his actions, his meanes, his name and all, ſhall die with himſelfe; and if hee ſhall ever happen to bee remembred, that remembrance ſhall onelie bee in ignominie, as the Wretch of his Countrie, the Curſe of his Kinred: and an vnthriſt for himſelfe.</p>
               <p>But I ſpeake not to ſuch a crew, whoſe baſeneſſe I knowe cannot climbe to ſurmount the meaneſt imagined difficultie, that may ariſe. I ſpeake to ſuch noble Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites and generous mindes, in whom doeth ſhine the light of knowledge to diſcerne the differences betweene a baſe ſecuritie and honourable actions, vice and vertue, ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie,
<pb facs="tcp:6072:15"/>
and true worth: and who in end ſhall not miſſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the enjoying the fruits of their labours in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their names to bee honoured with a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all remembrance.</p>
               <p>And if wee would ſtudie to bee remembred in our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterities, heere is offered the occaſion to inſert vs in the bookes of memorie: for if wee would portion our ſecond children in a plantation, and ſuch as in nature wee are bound to helpe, and advance: both ſhall wee bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred in their ever-living ſucceſſions, throughout all enſueing ages: and they provyded in a competent bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and meanes for them-ſelves, and theirs, and to bee thereafter proffitable for their King and Countrie: which is better, than either to be kept at home baſelie, &amp; ſhort of that which is beſeeming their birth, and qualitie: or to bee ſent to the ſervice of the Warres of forraine Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and to bee cutted away by the ſword, and then ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more againe remembred: and for ſo ſmall meanes, as thereby yee can furniſh themſelves both in rayment, and foode.</p>
               <p>Imbrace then the honours of plantation. Doe wee dreame of difficulties? then knowe; that it is out of the greateſt difficulties, that ſpring the greateſt honours: &amp; it is that Knight-hood, which is gotten vnder the ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of a King, and in the Fieldes which is moſt honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and not that, which wee acquire by our moneyes; as the moſt part is now a-dayes. And that our actions may both renowne vs, and beget vs moneyes, wee may ſee in the examples that I haue ſette before your eyes, both of forraine nations, and of our own Countriemen, in their late plantations of <hi>Ireland,</hi> their eſtates now, their dignities, their honours, their credite, and their riches: and what they were knowne to haue beene before.</p>
               <p>But theſe I leave to your judgments: onelie now, to make an end, I muſt entreate thee <hi>(Noble and courteous</hi>
