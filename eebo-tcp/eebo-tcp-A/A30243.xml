         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>Am not diſcouraged to publiſh this plain Practical Treatiſe to the world, although it bring no Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocks from <hi>Ophyr,</hi> no ſtrange af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected words or opinions. You ſhall not come out to ſee here, <hi>A man cloathed with ſoft raiments,</hi> but rather one like that man of <hi>Jericho,</hi> greatly <hi>wounded,</hi> deſiring <hi>oyl</hi> to be poured therein. And indeed holy and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual matter hath moſt convincing Majesty, when words do not obſcure it; Painting of a Diamond hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the luſtre thereof: What <hi>Tully</hi> ſaid of the Philoſopher, is much more true of the Divine, <hi>Si af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert eloquentiam, accipio; ſi non habet, non ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modum flagitem.</hi> Therefore it being my main
<pb facs="tcp:30767:3"/>
ſcope to bring the Reader into a powerful experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Diſcovery of True Grace upon his own heart: I thought Words, Opinions, Notions and Controverſies would be like <hi>Aſahel's</hi> Carkaſs in the way, to move men to gaze on them, while they neglected more neceſſary and excellent matter. <hi>The true Work of Grace ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Counterfeit, with the aſſurance thereof,</hi> is the main Subject of this Book, and ſhould be of our conſtant thoughts and meditations; this will be uſeful, when all other things will vaniſh; As <hi>Noahs</hi> Ark continued on the Waters, when all the ſtately Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laces of the world were overwhelmed. Grace justifying is indeed the treaſure of a Chriſtian, but Grace ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying is the Key to open thereunto: Grace juſtifying is much to be preſſed, either to broken contrite hearts, or when corrupt Doctrines (as in Popery) have dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly infected; but Grace ſanctifying is conſtantly to be urged to every natural man, and all unbottomed Profeſſors: Now there is no man that knoweth how it fareth with us in theſe dayes, but muſt acknowledge this Subject very uſeful. The vitals of godlineſs muſt be in a ſpecial manner preſerved; that inward infuſed heat must not be weakned by uſeleſs evaporations: Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes: Opinions and Differences of Judgement, muſt not be ſuckers to draw away nouriſhment from the ſubſtantial parts of holineſs. Our Saviour himſelf choſe this ſubject above all other to preach to his hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; It was not their flocking after him in multitudes did content him, but upon all occaſions he instructed them in the deep, ſure and rooted work of Grace: even
<pb facs="tcp:30767:3"/>
in his Miniſtery, he ſeparated the <hi>Sheep</hi> from <hi>Goats,</hi> the <hi>Wheat</hi> from the <hi>Chaff,</hi> and the <hi>good Ground</hi> from the <hi>bad,</hi> the <hi>wiſe Virgin</hi> from the <hi>fooliſh.</hi> This then is the <hi>one neceſſary thing,</hi> and they <hi>chooſe the better part</hi> who prefer it before all controverſal matter. Oh that all would be invited to taſte and ſee how ſweet the Practical Power of Grace is above all Notional Diſcourſes! And oh that this Book, if thou vouchſafeſt to reade it, might be to thee like <hi>Eliſha's</hi> ſtretching himſelf upon the dead Childe, to bring ſpiritual life with the Operations thereof! I have alſo (the matter requiring) diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the Treatiſe Practical Arguments againſt Arminianiſm, which is not onely repugnant to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eminent pregnant places of Scripture, but (as Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> well urged againſt <hi>Grevinchovins)</hi> is contrary <hi>Communi ſenſui fidelium,</hi> The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and ſenſe all the faithfull have had of Gods gracious working upon them. It hath great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grieved me to ſee men of great Repute amongst their Diſciples at leaſt, publickly to avouch ſuch Doctrines, without any trembling or heſitation; for who will not be ready to fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the guilded Image of Error, at the ſound of ſuch Sackbuts and Pſalteries. But I hope the People of God will ſay to ſuch Teachers, <hi>Non eſt diſputandum de guſtu,</hi> That which we have ſeen and felt, as it were, upon our Souls, that we will adhere unto. I ſhall ſhut up all with <hi>Luthers</hi> Prayer, <hi>A Doctore glorioſo, Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

The <hi>Corinthians</hi> diſtaſte this ſeverity, and queſtion his Apoſtolical power and authority: Love to mens luſts, and a deſire of ſecurity in them, rather then any ſolid Arguments, make men queſtion the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of Chriſts inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Apoſtle proveth his Calling by that ſpiritual ſucceſs and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full efficacy which his Word had among them, and therefore inſtead of proving and examining him, he commands them to try their own ſelves. This very Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may the faithfull Miniſters of God in <hi>England</hi> uſe againſt many who now condemn their Calling.</p>
                  <p>In the words you have a Duty enjoyned. 2. The object matter of it, Which is illuſtrated from an abſurd conſequent, if this duty be neglected.</p>

Now becauſe, beſides the bare knowledge, there may be alſo a good end or bad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in examination, therefore in an ill ſenſe the word is applied to the devil and his inſtruments, and in a good ſenſe to God, and here in the Text to our ſelves. It is further to be obſerved, that theſe words do imply that men are great ſtrangers to themſelves, and that ſo much ſelf-love doth blinde them, that they know not themſelves. Again, Theſe words alſo imply that there are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Marks and Signs, whereby a man may come certainly to know what he is,

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is uſed in <hi>Eſther.</hi> The Popiſh Commentators to elude this place when brought by the Orthodox, to prove, That a man may be certain of true grace in him, do anſwer, That the Apoſtle ſpeaks not here of the <hi>ſaving works</hi> of the Spirit, but the <hi>miraculous works;</hi> This is made an Argument that they were the Apoſtles of the true <hi>Meſſias,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the miracles wrought among them. And <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 5. the Apoſtle proveth the true Doctrine of Chriſt to be among them, becauſe of miracles done to them; we may adde alſo <hi>Math.</hi> 11. 5. when <hi>Iohns</hi> Diſciples come to know, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he were the true Chriſt,</hi> Jeſus returneth this anſwer, <hi>The blinde receive their ſight, the lame walk,</hi> &amp;c. As if he ſhould have ſaid, Theſe wonderfull works demonſtrate me to be the <hi>Meſſias.</hi> Now though it ſhould be granted, that this were part of the meaning, when the Apoſtle cals them to an experimental proof of his Apoſtleſhip among them, yet this cannot be all, becauſe Chriſt is not ſaid to dwell in us, according to the Scripture phraſe, or to be in us by a meer mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous faith only.</p>
                  <p>The conſequent abſurdity is in thoſe words, <hi>Unleſſe ye be reprobates.

Although we do not take reprobates here as oppoſed to predeſtinated, yet I ſee not why we may not well tranſlate it Reprobates, not as taking it for ſuch who are out of hope of ſalvation; but as the Scripture cals <hi>Reprobate ſilver,</hi> Jer. 6. 30. which hath no worth or fitneſſe in it for trade. Though the Apoſtle writeth here to the whole Church, yet the duty is to be obſerved reſpectively by every believer; Neither is that true of <hi>Eſtius,</hi> who to avoid the orthodox Arguments for Aſſurance of grace, ſaith, It may be eaſilier known, Chriſt is in ſuch a Church or Congregation, then in the heart of a particular believer: for the Text ſpeaks not of Chriſts being in his Doctrine and Ordinances among them, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is eaſily diſcerned; but of his ſpiritual inhabitation by ſanctifying grace in them.</p>

affectum &amp; effectum.</hi> Words of knowledge do ſometimes ſignifie the affections in the heart, and the effects thereof in life, how well were it if they did always ſo ſignifie among Chriſtians. In former times Chriſtians did much labour after an experimental knowledge, now they luxuriate into a meer brain-knowledge; howſoever in phyſick we call that man by way of contempt an <hi>Emperick,</hi> who goeth by experience only, and hath no knowledge of the nature of things, yet to be an <hi>Emperick</hi> in Chriſtianity may have a good ſenſe. <hi>In legendis libris non quaeramus ſcientiam, ſed ſaporem,</hi> ſaid <hi>Bernard,</hi> In reading books let us not ſo much look for ſcience, as a ſavourineſs of the truth upon our hearts. Now when the Apoſtle commands us <hi>to prove and try our ſelves,</hi> it is to endeavour to feel that <hi>in actu ſecundo,</hi> as they ſay, in actual working, which we perſwade our ſelves is in us <hi>actu primo,</hi> or habitually. As for example, Every man thinketh he is a believer, he is regenerated; To prove or try our ſelves, is to apply thoſe notes and marks which the Scripture makes of ſuch, and thereby to have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental feeling of the actual exerciſe of theſe things. The Scripture <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 9. cals this <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>ſenſe</hi> or <hi>feeling,</hi> where the Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth it from <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>; <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>judgement,</hi> making it to be the inward ſavoury ſenſe and feeling of divine things upon their hearts.</p>
                  <p>Now that this practical experimental work of grace in our ſelves, whereby we are able to diſcern what is true, and what is imperfect and counterfeit, is very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, will be made manifeſt from ſeveral grounds. As</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Our Saviour did in his Sermons much preſſe this point upon his hearers.</hi> If <note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> that be true which the Heathen ſaid, <hi>Quando ſapiens loquitur, aulaea animi ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> when a wiſe man ſpeaks he openeth the rich treaſures and wardrobe as it were of his minde; This is much more true of Chriſt, in whom are <hi>the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſdom.</hi> And of all practical points in Divinity our <hi>Saviour</hi> is moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently on this, That which is conceived his firſt Parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. it is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſhew the difference of true grace from that which is like it only, and as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a matter of great concernment; it is ſaid <hi>Luke</hi> 8. 8. after the Parable was ended, <hi>Jeſus</hi> cried, <hi>He that hath ears to hear let him hear.</hi> Now that <hi>crying</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attributed unto <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſpeech, but when his affections were very earneſt, and the matter of great importance. It is alſo to be conſidered that this he ſpeaks to a multitude that thronged after him with great attention, yet to ſuch he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, That few have a good and honeſt heart to receive the Word. When therefore our Saviour himſelf ſhall thus preach, that you may in the uſe of the Ordinances finde much alteration made in your ſelves, you may have joy, faith, ſome kinde of reformation, and yet not be the good and right ſoil: what a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation ſhould this be to us never to leave, till we be truly qualified: Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour alſo ſpends another Parable to this purpoſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. of the <hi>ten Virgins,</hi> where all are <hi>Virgins,</hi> that is, ſuch who had preſerved themſelves from the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latries and groſſe vices of the world; They both had lamps, they both go with confidence to meet the Bridegroom, and there is no differencing of one from the other, till the Bridegroom come: ſo that by this Parable it ſhould ſeem, that a Profeſſour having no more then a falſe imperfect or counterfeit work of grace, may live and die with a great deal of comfort and confidence, as if his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were exceeding good, and not finde it otherwiſe till it be too late.</p>
                  <p>Again <hi>Matth. 7. 24, 25, 26, By two kinde of builders, one upon the ſand, the other upon the rock;</hi> What is repreſented, but two kinde of believers, one that hath the outward profeſſion and way of Chriſtianity, and he is alſo truly <hi>rooted upon Chriſt;</hi> but there is another who builds upon the ſand, who diggeth not deep enough; and this is the greateſt part of Chriſtians: thy faith, thy repentance, thy joy are not deep enough, now mark the conſequence, <hi>The fall thereof was great.</hi> Thy damnation will be ſo much the more terrible, when all thy religious duties, all thy external profeſſion ſhall <hi>fall to the ground.</hi> And it is a fall by way of rending, as the word ſignifieth, Oh how wofull to be rent from God, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30767:15"/>
thoſe duties which thou truſtedſt in. Therefore our Saviour at <hi>ver.</hi> 22. ſaith, <hi>Many will call to him at that day, Have not we propheſied in thy Name, eat and drunk in thy preſence?</hi> that is, offered Sacrifices and received Sacraments? but for all that <hi>Chriſt knoweth them not.</hi> By all this you ſee, how neceſſary it is we be not deceived about the work of grace, and that we ought to have both our eyes in our head, leaſt we take an whole ſpirituall eſtate in counterfeit coyn.</p>

The <hi>Papiſts</hi> indeed preſſe this too farre, as if therefore none could ever tell when they did truly love God, or had a ſincere heart; but the falſneſſe of this is in time to be ſhewed, only there is much truth in this, that there is ſo much ſelf-love and carnal confidence in us, that we eaſily perſwade our ſelvs that we are indeed ſuch as we ought to be. Ask every man one after another, who is not confident that he is regenerated, that he hath an intereſt in Chriſt, that his heart is good? and why are they ſo? but becauſe they do not faithfullycompare the notes and characters of true grace, and diligently apply them to their own ſelvs. The <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> could never be beaten out of thoſe vain hopes and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal confidences. Hence the Apoſtle uſeth an emphatical word of a Jew, <hi>Rom. 2. 17. Thou reſteſt in the law,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Thou art ſecure in the law,</hi> as in ſome admirable priviledge and ſignal teſtimony of Gods love; That which Chriſt promiſed, <hi>viz. Rest to their ſouls,</hi> they found in the law, ſo that no load of ſinne could burden them, becauſe they had reſt here. As it is thus of a Jew, ſo we may ſay of a Chriſtian, he reſteth in the Doctrine of the Goſpel, and the outward uſe of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, not feeling the weight of ſinne. Inſomuch that it were farre better to ſee people pray with fear, and eat their bread with trembling and aſtoniſhment, leſt they have gone no farther yet then hypocrites, then to be ſo carnally and falſly perſwaded of their good condition as they are. How many are indeed but <hi>Glow-worms,</hi> or white rotten trees, of baſe materials, though ſome ſhining there be in their converſation! Therefore this Text might be faſtned upon the gates of the whole world, upon every door, every poſt, <hi>Examine, prove your ſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is very dangerous to miſcarry in this matter.</hi> Oh the confuſion that fell upon the fooliſh Virgins when their want of oil was diſcovered. How wary <note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> are you to take <hi>clipt ſilver,</hi> or <hi>counterfeit coyn?</hi> but it is great danger to take <hi>counterfeit Repentance</hi> for <hi>true Repentance, counterfeit Faith</hi> for <hi>true Faith.</hi> If that praying, profeſſing of thine, be not good and ſound, thou art undone for ever. When the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> Heb. 6. had reckoned up ſeveral particulars, which many among us do not attain unto, They were <hi>enlightned,</hi> they <hi>taſted of the good word of God,</hi> they <hi>were partakers of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> yet, ſaith he, <hi>I hope better things of you, and things that accompany ſalvation.</hi> What thunder and lightnings is here? better things then illumination, then participation of the holy things, better things then taſting of the good word of God? what, are not theſe things that do accompany ſalvation? May we not cry out with the Diſciples in another caſe, <hi>This is an hard ſaying, who then can be ſaved?</hi> Yet ſo it is, we Miniſters of Gods word may ſay, Except your righteouſneſs exceed that of outward profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, of repeating of Sermons, of Family-duties, of common works of Gods Spirit, which are in temporary believers, you can never enter into the kingdom of heaven; and therefore we hope and pray for better things of you, even ſuch as will ſurely accompany ſalvation.</p>

Fourthly, <hi>This practical diſcerning is of conſequence, becauſe of the difficulty to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Reaſon 4.</note> 
                     <hi>finde out the true differences between true grace and its counterfeit.</hi> It is hard doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to lay down the bounds, wherein they differ, inſomuch that ſome Divines make the work of grace in the temporary believer to differ from that of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated perſon, gradually only, not ſpecifically, but that is falſe. If then it be thus hard by way of Doctrine to ſet the bounds, how much more is it diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for Chriſtians in their practice to mark out the right way? The <hi>hypocrite</hi> feels a joy, feels a ſorrow, feeleth a ſweetneſs in the Ordinances, and ſo doth the godly, but to ſhew how one is ſure he is not deceived, and the other is, this is hard, though indeed they do differ as much as one in a dream, or madneſs, that is really perſwaded of, and affected with ſuch great advantages, doth from him that is truly awake, and knoweth he is not in a dream. Therefore the words <hi>to try</hi> and <hi>prove,</hi> do ſuppoſe that a man muſt have knowledge of the rule: and the characters which do deſcribe ſuch a grace, he muſt alſo have skilfulneſs in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging by way of application theſe notes to himſelf, and this muſt be done out of a temptation, with much attending and perſevering thereunto. For as in doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal controverſies, that is the great Queſtion, Which is the true Church, and that which doth not erre? as alſo, What are the eſſential marks that do conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a Church? So in practicals, This is the great doubt, What is the truth of grace? Whether I be the man that have it? And what are the notes to decipher it? And as for the former Queſtion, we would fain have ſome viſible infallible Judge to determine it that there might be no more diſpute: So here, we would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ſuch a peculiar revelation from heaven that ſhould by name ſay unto us, we are thoſe Chriſtians in whom are no guile.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>It is of concernment, becauſe of the manifold advantages that will</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Reaſon</hi> 5. Advantages of this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our ſelves. I.</note> 
                     <hi>come to us, when we have attained to ſuch an experimentall knowledge of our ſelves.</hi> As</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We ſhall account all our former knowledge of divine things, and all our parts though never ſo admirable, to have been but like a tinkling cymbal. When thou comeſt to have this inward feeling of holy things upon thy heart, thou wilt bewail all thy duties, and conferences, and religious performances done by thee, as a Parrat that had no underſtanding of theſe things. If a man reade in a book, or ſee in a map ſuch and ſuch countreys, he hath indeed ſome confuſed knowledge, but if he travel himſelf into thoſe countreys, and ſee the Towns and buildings, he will ſay his former apprehenſion of them was but lame to what he hath now, or as the Queen of <hi>Sheba,</hi> who had heard rumours of <hi>Solomons</hi> wiſdom, when ſhe came to have an experimental knowledge of it, then ſhe was aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſaid, <hi>All that ſhe had heard was nothing to that which ſhe ſaw;</hi> So it is in matter of grace, if God work theſe ſavoury inward experiments in thee, thou wilt be aſtoniſhed to ſee the difference between thy ſelf now and once; all that thou haſt heard, read or preached, is nothing to that thou feeleſt; But how is it to be feared, that many have ſeen godlineſs but in the <hi>Map</hi> only, they never had experience of the thing it ſelf. How many are there that talk of converſion or repentance, as men do of bringing forth a childe, who never had the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the throbs and pains that then are endured. <hi>Paul,</hi> what a long time did he live in a road of religious duties, but when he came to have an experimental work upon him, he <hi>died,</hi> whereas he was <hi>alive before,</hi> that is, he became ſenſible of the damnable and dangerous eſtate he was in, whereas he had great confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his good life and ſalvation before. And thus it is with every man that hath gotten experimental knowledge; Alas (ſaith he) I was alive once, I thought my ſelf ſome body, when I could pray, write Sermons, diſpute ſo underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, but now I ſee I did not know what that faith was, or godlineſs was, that I did argue ſo much about, I never knew any thing of God, or of his gracious works till now, will that ſoul ſay.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Where there is this experimental knowledge, that mans heart is as it <note place="margin">II.</note>
                     <pb n="6" facs="tcp:30767:16"/>
were the Bibles counterpane. The Scripture is the original, and his heart is the copy of it, he can read over the Promiſes, the Threatnings, and can ſay, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batum eſt. David</hi> in his <hi>Pſalms, Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles, ſpeak that mans heart, feel that mans temptations, make that mans objections. Hence you have an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent expreſſion, <hi>John 3. 33. He that receiveth his teſtimony, ſetteth to his ſeal, that God is true.</hi> The Scripture ſpeaketh of Gods ſealing to us, and our ſealing to him. In this place it is a Metaphor from their civil contracts which were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and ſolemnly declared to be good by ſeals, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 10. So he that doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed receive the teſtimony of the Scripture, he doth ſolemnly declare by his life and converſation, that God is true; Therefore all thoſe who in the general ſay, they believe, yet ſhew not a practical converſation accordingly, they ſet not their ſeal that God is true.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Where this is, it will powerfully dead the heart to all humane ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies; <note place="margin">III.</note> That as in man the Philoſophers ſay, the vegetative and ſenſitive life is ſwallowed up in the rational; ſo in a Chriſtian his natural and animal life is in great meaſure turned to his ſupernatural life. In the thorny ground there did the corn and thorns come up together, but where the life of grace is in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical exerciſe of it, all ſuch ſuckers will be cut off. It is not head-notions, but heart-feelings that will exclude immoderacy of affections to other things. A man that a long while taſted of the wine of brain-knowledge, when he comes to taſte of this experimental knowledge, he will ſay The new is beſt. Hence <hi>Gal. 2. 20. Paul</hi> denieth <hi>he liveth, but Chriſt liveth in him. Omnis vita eſt propter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectationem,</hi> All life is for delight. Till therefore thou canſt take delight and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental ſweetneſs in holy things, thy tongue indeed may be often about good things, but thy heart can never be in them. Love of the world may ſtand with the former kinde of knowledge, but not with the later. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, that dogs cannot hunt where the ſent of ſweet flowers is, becauſe that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth the ſmell; ſo neither can we runne after Chriſt in the ſweetneſs of his ointments, when the ſmell of worldly delights and earthly refreſhments do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe.</p>

A ſpiritual Sermon is a <hi>Fountain ſealed up,</hi> the ſpiritual adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Sacrament, is a <hi>Garden incloſed;</hi> formal notional Chriſtians underſtand not, or perceive the full ſweetneſs thereof. There were many people in a throng and croud about our Saviour, but the infirm woman onely, felt efficacy come from him: ſo many may attend the Ordinances, frequent the Aſſemblies, but ſome few only finde the inward power of Chriſt derived unto their ſouls: As therefore <hi>Thomas,</hi> though upon an ill ground, ſaid, He would not believe Chriſt to be riſen, unleſſe he <hi>ſaw his wounds, and put his fingers into them:</hi> So neither do thou believe thy eſtate to be good and ſound, unleſſe thou mayeſt ſee and feel the efficacy of Chriſt in his Ordinances upon thee. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks <note place="margin">

The Apoſtle doth excellently deſcribe ſuch a temper, he cals it <hi>Doting about Queſtions,</hi> or as it is in the Greek, <hi>Sick and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing;</hi> Even as much fretting and vexation conſumeth the fleſh of the body, ſo do proud and vain affectations of new opinions pine away the ſoul. What is this but to think <hi>that a ſtone may become bread,</hi> and <hi>a ſerpent fiſh?</hi> As it is a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters duty to preach only thoſe things that are profitable, <hi>The ſower went out to ſow good ſeed,</hi> not poiſon, or empty chaff; ſo it is alſo required of private Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that they do think, conferre of, and ſtudy thoſe things only that may edifie and practically build up their ſouls. I would not hereby diſcourage an indeavour in Chriſtians to grow in knowledge. The Apoſtle reproveth ſome for being babes, and that he could not ſpeak unto them as ſpiritual but as carnal, only they muſt know, that faith hath efficacious purifying acts as well as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acts, and therefore our increaſe muſt be equal both <hi>quoad notitiam,</hi> and <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciam,</hi> in reſpect of knowledge and efficacy alſo. A Chriſtian may grow either <hi>Quoad amplitudinem ſcientiae</hi> or <hi>efficaciam ſcientiae,</hi> the inlargement of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge both in reſpect of the matter, he may know more things then he did, as alſo in the manner, more clearly, evidently and firmly then he did, or elſe in the efficacy of his knowledg, though he do not more things then he did, yet he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them more practically, they have a greater influence upon his heart and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30767:17"/>
they move and inflame him more then ever they did; now though the former way of increaſe be neceſſary and pleaſing to God, yet this is much more. Take heed then that we be not like <hi>Pharaohs</hi> lean Kine, that devour many Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, but yet are as ſtarved and ill-favoured as before. When one came with a curious Queſtion to our Saviour, asking him, <hi>Whether many ſhould be ſaved?</hi> How pertinently doth our Saviour anſwer him, <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate.</hi> This therefore diſcovers the neceſſity of importunate preſſing and urging practical knowledge upon people in theſe dayes, <hi>Ubi malunt homines diſputare quàm vivere,</hi> they had rather argue then live. As little boyes in ſport ſtrive who ſhall ſtrike moſt ſparks out of their iron, not intending to kindle thereby for their uſe, ſo do Chriſtians ſtrive who ſhall ſtrike out the moſt ſubtil and fineſt ſpun notions, not intending the profit of their ſouls therein.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>By this practical experience, a Chriſtian ſhall attain to the end of all</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">III. And to attain to the end of knowledge, <hi>viz.</hi> to do.</note> 
                     <hi>knowledge, which is to do. If ye know theſe things, bleſſed are you if ye do them.</hi> It was ſaid of ſome people that they had money only to tell it, they made no other uſe of it; it is as vain when we have knowledge in matters of religion only to know, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. it is called, <hi>The acknowledging of the truth after godlineſſe;</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that in the Scripture phraſe, <hi>They who have not the practical power of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, are denied to have any knowledge at all.</hi> Hence are wicked men ſo often cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>fools,</hi> and ſaid <hi>not to know God.</hi> By this means a private Chriſtian may be ſaid to know more of God, then a learned Doctor that hath nothing but orthodoxy; for you may have an orthodox learned man write and preach admirably about juſtifying faith, converſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet in regard of the practical knowledge of theſe things no wayes comparable to ſome private man or woman, who feel the power of theſe things upon their own hearts: It is diſputed, Whether Divinity be ſpeculative or practical, and it is reſolved by many upon good grounds, that it is practical, there being nothing in all Religion but what is to be improved for for practice one way or other, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. It is well done that orthodoxy and true Doctrine be defended by books, diſputations and Sermons; but above all things we are to indeavour that our life anſwer our Chriſtian profeſſion. When Chriſt looked upon the fig-tree that had only leaves on it, <hi>he curſed it.</hi> To him that knoweth how to do good, and doth it not, there is the greater ſinne; as if he ſhould have ſaid, ſaith <hi>Bernard, Sumenti cibum, &amp; non digerenti, pernicioſum eſt ei;</hi> to him that takes meat, and doth not digeſt it, it is very dangerous. There muſt be true Doctrine, and a godly life joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Cyril</hi> conſidering <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant, who gave to <hi>Rebecca ear-rings</hi> and <hi>bracelets,</hi> applieth it to Chriſt and his Church, who vouchſafeth to her both true faith that cometh by hearing, and a godly life the practice or work of our hands.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>By this experimental knowledge a man will be ſetled in the truth, and endure all perſecution rather then forſake it.</hi> He will believe no fallacies or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſms, <note place="margin">IIII.

The ſenſe of taſte and feeling do herein differ from the other ſenſes, that they are joyned really to the objects themſelves, whereas ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hearing do receive only the intentional ſpecies, and therefore cannot make ſuch a real and powerfull impreſſion, as is in taſting or feeling. <hi>Pauls</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental <hi>knowing whom he did believe,</hi> made him boldly to ſpeak: what makes men have a monethly or yearly faith, change their opinions as often as their garments, but becauſe they have not felt the power of truth upon their own ſoul?

Be not carried about with divers doctrines, for it is good to have the heart eſtabliſhed with grace;</hi> Where the Apoſtle makes grace and godlineſs to ſtabliſh and ſettle the heart; and therefore men that are led aſide into errors, are ſaid to be carried about with them, a Metaphor from chaff and ſtraw, which becauſe of its em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptineſs and lightneſs is blown this way and that way. Thus a man that is empty of grace, and not conſolidated by the power of it upon his heart, he runneth from one opinion to another, without any ſtay at all. Therefore a ſavoury in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward knowledge of divine truths, would be an excellent ballaſt in the ſoul. And as it would thus keep the heart firm to the truth, ſo it would unite the heart to holy things as the beſt and ſweeteſt, without hypocriſie, double-mindedneſs and inconſtancy, and this is much to be conſidered, thy heart is one while for good things, another while as vehemently for the world, thy heart is divided between the Creator and the creature, how cometh this about? for want of real and experimental knowledge of the goodneſs of God, <hi>He that drinketh of this water</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ſhall never thirſt more,</hi> that is, <hi>Siti totalis indigentiae,</hi> with a thirſt of total want. Now how great a mercy it is to be kept from that double-mindedneſs the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, To be like a wave that is ſometimes toſſed up high to the heavens, and then preſently ſinks down low in the ſea; or like the Graſhoppers that leap up towards heaven, but immediatly fall down to the ground: When temptations of profit and pleaſure come, how eaſily can they be repulſed by an heart who feels better things? So that till you have an inward feeling and joy about the things of God, you are not able to withſtand other temptations, but you will alwayes be ſtriving to make poſſible that which our Saviour hath pronounced ſo impoſſible, <hi>To ſerve God and Mammon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall in the next place ſhew you what impediments and deſtructive principles <note place="margin">Impediments of an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental proof in our ſelves. 1. Self-love and carnal conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</note> there are to hinder us in this experimental proof, which we are to make of our ſelves. For this duty here preſſed of <hi>examining and proving of our ſelves</hi> is like the compound that the high-Prieſt was to make, conſiſting of choice materials; Now one dangerous principle is, when we go to prove and examine our ſelves, being prepoſſeſſed with ſelf-love and carnal confidence, and where this founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is laid, its impoſſible to make any good ſuperſtruction. Hence all the pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and diſcovering Sermons which the Prophets and Chriſt made upon the Jews and Phariſees, could make no battery, give no ſhaking to their rotten foundation, and all becauſe they had carnal confidence, and vain truſt in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Therefore when thou ſetteſt upon this duty, thou muſt ſay, <q>Lord, I come not in any love of my ſelf, I can as eaſily judge and condemn my ſelf for an hypocrite (if ſuch I ſhall be found) as approve my ſelf for an upright one: O Lord, it ſhall not ſeem an hard thing to me, if I perceive that I have thus long, thus many years laboured in vain. O Lord, it ſhall be ſo farre from being matter of diſcontent, as that I ſhall rejoyce, if now at length, I

may be put into a ſound and right way of holineſs.</q> But how many go to ſearch the grounds, principles and ends of their actions with as much negligence, as ſome officers do alehouſes and unlawfull meetings? they are unwilling to ſee the <hi>hidden works of darkneſſe,</hi> Prov. 28. 26. <hi>He that truſteth in his own heart is a fool.</hi> It is deſperate folly to believe thy heart will deal truly with thee. Hence the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> calleth it <hi>deſperately wicked,</hi> or crafty, which will beguile and deceive thee without much caution, inſomuch that this duty of examination is but ridiculous, and a meer mockery, unleſs we reſolve to become impartial Judges. It is like diſputing with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> who hold the true Church cannot erre, and then that ſhe is the true Church, whereby ſhe becomes incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and without hope of healing, <hi>Prov. 16. 2. Every mans way is clean in his own eyes, but the Lord pondereth the hearts.</hi> This is one way to blinde us, but <note place="margin">Temptations to unbelief.</note> then we may runne into another extream, <hi>by temptation of unbelief;</hi> and thus when a godly ſoul ſet againſt it ſelf, and taking every thing for hypocriſie that he ſhall do, if in this caſe he goeth to examine himſelf, he will alſo draw falſe concluſions; As the carnal man fails the former way, ſo the tempted Chriſtian doth the other way; The one believeth every thing to be done with a good heart, the other nothing; But as a man that would ſee his face in the water, muſt make no commotion or trouble at all; ſo he that would rightly judge his heart, muſt take heed of carnal confidence on one ſide, and unbelief on the other ſide.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond dangerous principle is, <hi>When we conclude that action to be done well,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. An erroneous principle.</note> 
                     <hi>which is for the matter good, whatſoever the principles, ends, motives or manner be.</hi> This deſtroyeth many thouſands, <hi>Jehu</hi> did that which was according to Gods will, and this made him bold to ſay he is zealous for God, <hi>Come ſee my zeal,</hi> ſaith he; but though his actions were very great, and of high concernment to the Church of God, yet God would be avenged on him for theſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 1. 4. Who would think God would be avenged on <hi>Jehu</hi> for diſpoſſeſſing <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> killing <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, making ſo great a Reformation as he did? But becauſe he himſelf did not do theſe things with an upright heart, therefore he is threatned. The Phariſees had an external righteouſneſs, but there was a great gulf between them and true godlineſs. Hence they are called <hi>Vipers,</hi> which though they have a glorious skin, yet are full of poiſon; and how holy ſoever they appeared, yet like the Serpent they eat of the duſt of the earth, live upon earthly advantages. A man therefore had need be Eagle-eyed, or like <hi>Ezekiels</hi> living creatures full of eyes, that would ſee into the bottom of his wayes: Thy profeſſion, thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-duties, thy religious performances are plainly viſible, every one that run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth may read them; but the ends and motives are ſecret and latent, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations and roots of things lie under ground; The firſt letters in the book are garniſhed with many gaies, and we can hardly tell what they are. This made <hi>Paul</hi> diſtinguiſh between a <hi>Jew outwardly, and a Jew inwardly, circumciſion of the fleſh and circumciſion of the heart;</hi> Eſpecially the end, and motive that doth ſpecifie and diſtinguiſh moral actions; Two may be in a family, both pray, both mourn for ſinne, yet becauſe one is done upon a pure motive and principle from God and to God, therefore it is right; and the other, becauſe its defective in one of theſe, is rejected: who then is ſufficient and prepared for ſo great a duty as this is?</p>
                  <p>A third way of miſguidance is, <hi>When we try our ſelves by falſe Rules, when we weigh with falſe weights;</hi> This duty of examining and proving ſuppoſeth there is <note place="margin">3. Trying our ſelves by falſe rules.</note> ſome ſure ſtandard, which if we go by, we are ſure not to be deceived, now that rule is the word of God; but as in matter of Doctrine men have left the Scriptures the ſure rule, and taken up antiquity, univerſality, tradition, and the like for their guide, and by this means have fallen into the ditch; ſo in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of godlineſs, when we ſhould try our ſelves according to the characters and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:30767:18"/>
ſigns that the Scripture deciphers, we take up principles in the world, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of others, the converſation of moſt in the world; And thus it is with us, as men in an Hoſpital, becauſe every one is either wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or lame, or ſome way diſeaſed, therefore none are offenſive to each other.</p>
                  <p>The fourth and laſt dangerous way to miſcarriage, is, <hi>When we miſtake</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. A miſtaking about the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter of our enquiry.</note> 
                     <hi>about the object matter which is to be diſcovered, when we miſtake what godlineſſe is, and ſo think it to be in us, when it is not;</hi> And in this is the grand impoſture; men take a good nature, morality, civility, the common graces of Gods Spirit for godlineſs, and when they ſee they have theſe, they conclude all is well. This is as if a man digging for gold ſhould take lead or copper for it, and think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf rich, becauſe he hath theſe. He therefore that would not be deceived in this great matter, muſt conſider what the Scripture makes the nature and properties of godlineſs, and muſt conclude godlineſs is no leſſe or inferiour a thing then the Scripture makes it. If a man ſhall not reach up to thoſe Scripture directions, he is but a Glow-worm though he ſeem to be the Sun; but more of theſe things hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Let the Uſe be, to ſet us with all diligence, fear and trembling about this <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> work: How much better is it to eat and drink, to pray and hear with fear and trembling of heart, then to ſit down ſecure when there is no cauſe? Believe not your hearts in times of danger, or fears of death, or any ſudden fits; You ſee <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Ahab</hi> can cry out of ſinne under the judgements of God, but attend to pure motives only; In the civil law no credit is given to a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that is given by one upon the wrack, becauſe it is ſuppoſed, the torture and pain will make him ſay any thing to be eaſed. And thus in times of trouble and fear even a falſe and unſound heart will ſay any thing, hoping for ſome relief. Howſoever in this life we may ſatisfie our ſelves and others with a profeſſion and external diligence in holy duties, yet at the day of Judgement we ſhall be aſtoniſhed and ſilent before God. In the Parable, the man that was at the feaſt <hi>without a wedding Garment,</hi> when expoſtulated with, was preſently <hi>ſpeechleſſe,</hi> he pretended not poverty, or difficulty to get a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Garment, but was immediately ſpeechleſſe, even as if he had had a muzzle put on his mouth, as the word ſignifieth. At that day all the crooked and ſubtile windings, all the falſe pretexts of thy own heart, will be ſo diſcovered, that thou canſt not but ſee it, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it.</p>

                  <p>I Shall abſolve this Doctrine, in handling of one practical Queſtion, and that is, <hi>Whether Hypocrites may not attain to ſome meaſure of practical Knowledge in matters of Religion?</hi> Is that <hi>ignis,</hi> which in the godly is <hi>Calidus &amp; lucidus,</hi> in hypocrites <hi>Lucidus tantúm?</hi> Can unregenerate men go no further then to meer knowledge and illumination? may not this oil poured upon their heads fall down upon the will and affections alſo? As they have imperfect knowledge, ſo may they not have inchoate affections about good things? and if they may, wherein ſhall we be able to give ſound differences, or exact bounds and limits between the practical knowledge in the one and the other? This is a point of univerſal uſefulneſs; And for the opening of this, conſider there are three general ſorts of men who go under the name and title of Chriſtians, all pretending a right and intereſt to all the priviledges of the Covenant of Grace,</p>
                  <p>The firſt is of thoſe who have only the Name and outward Ordinances of the <note place="margin">Three ſorts of men go under the name of Chriſtians. 1.</note> Chriſtian Religion, but have not the leaſt influence or power from it, <hi>In works they deny him.</hi> Theſe are like ſome Apothecary boxes that may have the inſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome cordial, but within is deadly poiſon; They are in names Chriſtians, in actions Heathens; and the Prophet called the Rulers of the Jews for their wickedneſs, though circumciſed, <hi>Princes of Sodom and Gomorrah.</hi> Theſe are (as a Father ſaid) <hi>Sine Chriſto Christiani,</hi> yea <hi>contra Chriſtum,</hi> Chriſtians with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, yea againſt Chriſt. Howſoever in ſome reſpects they may be ſaid to be better then Heathens, in which ſenſe <hi>Arnobius</hi> ſaid, <hi>Melior invenietur ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicio Chriſtianus fornicator, quàm caſtiſſimus idololatra.</hi> A Chriſtian even in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication is better then a moſt chaſt idolater; yet in other reſpects he is far worſe: ſuch as theſe are have no real and ſaving benefit by Chriſt, for <hi>Non actibus, ſed finibus penſantur officia;</hi> They being like dead corpſes, that have ſweet fragrant flowers ſtrewed upon them, but yet are not in the leaſt degree made more ſavoury by them; and certainly it is an aggravation of the wickedneſs of ſuch, that when moral Philoſophy, and the principles of reaſon have been able to cure the outſide ungodlineſs of many men; The truths of Chriſtianity, which have a power to regenerate, and to work a new nature, ſhould not ſo much as change the skinne of men. Yet if we caſt our eye upon the greateſt number of thoſe who yet are baptized into the name of Chriſt, ſhall we not finde them in the rank of thoſe, who have only a name in Chriſtianity, and nothing elſe, who derive not the leaſt efficacy or power from Chriſt, but are as a dead hand, or a withered branch, whoſe lives are a continual blaſphemy to the Goſpel of Chriſt?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another ſort is of thoſe, who beſides the name, have alſo ſome influence <note place="margin">2.</note>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:30767:19"/>
and operations of the Spirit of God upon them, and many of them are in ſuch a way as an <hi>embryo</hi> to a childe, only they prove abortive, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. The ſecond and third kinde of hearers were in this number; Divines as they attribute to the former ſort a meer hiſtorical faith, ſuch as the devils have, though it may be thought they have no faith at all in any reſpect or notion, unleſſe it be an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane aſſent; ſo they give to theſe later a temporary faith, which they make to differ from hiſtorical thus, becauſe it is carried with ſome kinde of affections, both in <hi>revelantem,</hi> the perſon revealing it, who is God, and <hi>in rem revelatam,</hi> the matter revealed, whereas hiſtorical faith is without any affections at all; now although theſe who are in this condition, be in reſpect of their eſtate carnal and unregenerate, yet they differ from the former, as much as copper from dung, and howſoever comparatively to the godly, they are but counterfeit and falſe, yet they are as pearls and ſtarres reſpectively to prophane men, for theſe have a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical experience of ſome power of divine truths upon them (and howſoever the Spirit of Chriſt <hi>doth not dwell in them,</hi> becauſe they are not <hi>members of the body of Chriſt,</hi> and as the ſoul of a man works not as a form to any part that is not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the body; ſo neither doth the Spirit of Chriſt operate ſavingly, but to the body of Chriſt) yet the Spirit of God works as an outward efficient cauſe breathing upon them. The Spirit of God works not in them, <hi>Ut in domicilio,</hi> but <hi>ut in organo,</hi> an inſtrument, which he uſeth for the good of the Church; Now in this ſort there is a great latitude, ſome having a greater meaſure of theſe workings then others, as the third kinde of ground went beyond the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>A third ſort is of thoſe who are indeed incorporated into Chriſts body, and <note place="margin">3.</note> ſo do receive vivifical influence from him, that are in him, as a living branch in the Vine, as a living member in the body, and ſo are animated by that Spirit, though with an infinite diſproportion, which Chriſt himſelf their head is; theſe are <hi>born of God,</hi> have an <hi>immortal ſeed</hi> in them, ſhall never periſh, becauſe Chriſt will not loſe any of his myſtical members; and theſe only have a proper, clear and full experimental knowledge of Chriſts ſufferings and reſurrection upon their ſoul; and theſe do differ from the former not gradually, as ſome thought, but ſpecifically; a regenerate man though the loweſt in that kinde, differeth from the hypocrite though the higheſt in his kinde, as much as the heavens, which according to ſome Philoſophers is made of a fifth eſſence, from the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary bodies, and the works of Gods Spirit upon hypocrites, if increaſed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo high, would not come up to ſaving grace, as copper will never be gold. In the next place obſerve, That howſoever hypocrites, or temporary believers, do not attain to that which is indeed ſaving, yet great are the works of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit upon them, and they have many experimental motions of the truths in religion wrought on them. I will chooſe out ſome material ones, to awaken you, and make you tremble, leaſt you be not in a form above them, yea happily many have not come up ſo far as they.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, <hi>They have an experimental knowledge of the common gifts of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">How far hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal knowledge. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Gods Spirit; They feel what it is to have aſſiſtance from God in thoſe adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> Thus <hi>Matth. 7. Have not we propheſied and caſt out devils in thy Name?</hi> They did it by the power of Chriſt, and in virtue from him; and although we told you, this was not the whole ſcope of the Apoſtle here, to prove Chriſt was in them, by the miracles and wonderful works done amongſt them, yet this was included as part: Thus <hi>Saul</hi> had another ſpirit, not in the way of ſanctification, but political adminiſtration, whereby he had an experimental knowledge of Gods power and aſſiſtance in his place. And thus many a Chriſtian may finde great aſſiſtance in duties, in parts and abilities, and may finde the power of the Lord going along with him; but this be nothing to his ſanctification. And it is to be feared that in theſe times this is the furtheſt practical experience of Gods help that moſt have; if it be not ſo, why is it that people do ſo abound in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30767:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diſputations, and are ſo little in mortification and vivification, they ſprout out into ſuckers and leaves, not into fruit; and we ſee in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally men are more prone to deſire the gifts of Gods Spirit, which are for publick adminiſtration, more then the graces of ſanctification. But (alas) to be a good prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, a good diſputant, to be able to make good enlarged prayers, do argue only <hi>Spiritum moventem,</hi> not <hi>inhabitantem,</hi> the Spirit of God breathing on thee, not dwelling in thee; neither doth God beſtow this on thee for any love to thy ſoul, but becauſe of his Church, as nurſes to Princes children feed on delicate fare, not for their own ſake, but for the childrens ſake to whom they give milk: Hence it is that they preach that Goſpel, that faith, that Chriſt to others, which they do not partake off, and ſo are like thoſe poſts in high-wayes, with hands on them, directing to ſuch or ſuch a way, but they never ſtirre out of the place they are in: Oh therefore that the Miniſters of God could become ſons of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in this matter, you have had experience of God inabling, inlarging, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the common gifts of his Spirit, but what have you felt of Gods renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſanctifying and healing of your luſts?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>They may have ſome practical experience of the bitterneſſe of ſinne, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>the terrors that come by it.</hi> We may not think that the terrours upon <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> were by a meer natural light of conſcience, for ſuch could quickly be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed, but there was alſo the Spirit of God convincing and ſetting ſinne home upon the conſcience, Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. the Spirit of God is called, <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of bondage and fear,</hi> becauſe it works ſuch fear and trouble in the heart of a ſinner, not the ſinfulneſs of them, but the troubleſom motions and ſtirrings of them in our ſouls: Thus we may not ſay, that thoſe humiliations of <hi>Ahab</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> when they cried out to God becauſe of their ſins, were by the meer power of their natural free-will, but by the common work of the Spirit of God; and thus thoſe many gripes and wounds of heart, which are inflicted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many in the preaching of the Word, whereby the memory of their ſins is like wormwood and gall to them, floweth from the Spirit of God; whatſoever is wrought inſtrumentally by the Word, is efficiently from Gods Spirit; and this experience confirmeth that many men who yet are not made new creatures, have an hell ſometimes in their hearts, their conſciences can tell that it is a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thing to ſinne againſt God. Yea becauſe the time hath been, when they have had ſuch wounds and blows, they therefore conclude, that they were in the new birth, and although they brought forth nothing but winde in all that pain, yet they rejoyce as if <hi>a man-childe, a new creature were born.</hi> It may not therefore be denied, but even one who is a wilde olive, and not yet implanted in Chriſt, may have the inward feeling of Gods diſpleaſure for ſinne, may be able to tell you the time hath been they could not eat, or drink, or ſleep, but cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, Oh their ſins, ſins, ſins; but yet do not demonſtrate Chriſt dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>They may have practical experience of deſires and longing affections after things that are good.</hi> They having ſudden and confuſed apprehenſions of the goodneſs of ſpiritual things, may have ſome ſuch general affections and deſires after them; In ſuch a temper they cry out, <hi>Joh. 6. 34. Lord give us evermore this bread;</hi> Chriſt told them, <hi>He was the manna and bread of life,</hi> and ſpeaks of the benefits that come to ſuch who eat and feed on him, it is bread not only that nouriſheth, but giveth life (which no other bread doth) Hereupon in a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed manner with ſome good affections, they cry, <hi>Give us evermore this bread;</hi> They were like <hi>Peter</hi> in a transfiguration, not knowing what they ſaid; Thus <hi>Balaam</hi> he is in ſuch a transfiguration, for he foreſeeing the happineſs of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, <hi>Wiſhes to die the death of the righteous;</hi> yea is affected with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Ordinances and worſhip of God among them, <hi>How beautifull are thy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles, O Iſrael?</hi> (ſaith he) in thoſe ſudden flaſhes upon him; How often are people deluded in this, becauſe in ſome fits they have good affections and deſires.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:30767:20"/>
Fourthly, <hi>They have a practical experience of ſome ſweetneſſe and joy in the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>of God, and ſome aſſurance of Gods favour flowing thencefrom.</hi> Thus <hi>Matth. 13. They received the word with joy;</hi> and <hi>Johns</hi> hearers were ſaid for a while <hi>to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in his light; Ezckiel</hi> was to his hearers, <hi>As a pleaſant Song;</hi> And <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6. Thoſe, who had not things accompanying ſalvation, are ſaid, <hi>To taſte of the word of God;</hi> They did taſte it as <hi>Jonathan</hi> did a little honey, but had not the full of it. Whereas the people of God are ſaid to eat his fleſh, and drink his bloud, yea rivers of living water are ſaid to flow out of their belly; and from theſe experimental taſtings ariſe ſome confidence of their condition, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the fooliſh virgins, who with much boldneſs, and without any ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their want of oil, <hi>Go out to meet the Bridegroom;</hi> Now this is thought a great matter, if ſo be their hearts have been at any time ſweetned and mollified in the Ordinances of God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>They have ſuch an experimental working, as that it hath influence upon</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>their lives and converſations, it makes ſome alteration and change there.</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 10. Thoſe Apoſtates who returned to their own vomit, and ſo never had true grace, are ſaid to <hi>eſcape the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> and therefore they are called <hi>Virgins,</hi> Matth. 25. though <hi>fooliſh ones,</hi> becauſe they were kept from the prophaneneſs of others; Now, a man would think this were all in all, what would you have more? <hi>Thoſe that ſtole ſteal no more,</hi> thoſe that were <hi>drunk</hi> are ſo no more, thoſe that were <hi>filthy</hi> are ſo no more; but yet as the Swine are Swine for their natures, though waſhed from their mire; thus are they unregenerate and filthy ſtill, though outwardly cleanſed: By theſe inſtances you ſee, that even men who are not in the faith after a ſanctifying and ſaving manner, may yet have many ſeeming works of grace on their ſoul.</p>
                  <p>But yet there is a difference many waies, I ſhall but briefly and generally <note place="margin">The difference between the experimental knowledge of the unſound Chriſtian and the regenerate. 1.</note> touch at the differences, becauſe they will come in more properly in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeits.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, <hi>There is a difference in the very nature of them.</hi> That which is in the godly differs from that in the moſt refined hypocrite, as much as gold from droſſe, or true pearls from counterfeits; Hence <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. the fourth ground, or kinde of hearers, are only ſaid to have <hi>an honeſt and good heart.</hi> So that the ſoil of one ground differs eſſentially from the other, and this may be abundantly cleared, in that the promiſes of Juſtification and eternal life are not made to any kinde of faith that an hypocrite hath, but they are made to the faith of a godly man, though it be in the leaſt degree; ſo that a little infant in true grace, may by the hand of faith receive Chriſt, when a Gyant-like hypocrite, cannot take him: but more of this in time.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond difference is <hi>in clearneſſe and evidence;</hi> That which they do know <note place="margin">2.</note> about the things of God is in a more confuſed manner, becauſe that light in them is but by way of flaſh, and a ſudden enlightning, not as permanent and abiding light in them; a little ſip or taſte of heavenly things cannot inable a man exactly to comprehend the excellency and worth of them. Therefore they ſee theſe things, as the man not perfectly cured of his blindeneſs, <hi>That ſaw men walking by like trees.</hi> It is true, the holieſt that are do but ſee in part; and <hi>David</hi> prayeth, <hi>That his eyes may be opened to ſee the wonderfull things in Gods law.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> alſo prayeth for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> who yet <hi>were light in the Lord, that their eyes might be opened, and they have the ſpirit of wiſdom and revelation:</hi> but yet is not like the purblinde hypocrite, who doth by a queſtion rather judge of godly things, then any way elſe.</p>
                  <p>A third difference is <hi>in the operation,</hi> for the experience of the godly inclineth <note place="margin">3.</note> them ſpiritually, makes them more holy, carrieth them out of themſelves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all that is done upon the unſound Chriſtian ends in carnal effects, it makes him puffed up, vainly confident in himſelf. Thus the Phariſees, though they did abound in the duties of the Law, yet their greateſt corruptions did run out there.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30767:21"/>
Hence a Phariſee praying, a Phariſee giving alms, was a Phariſee in all the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his corruption. <hi>John 3. He that is not born of the Spirit, is fleſh;</hi> and this fleſh doth extend not only to his ſins and corruptions, but alſo to his duties; Therefore obſerve whether the duties that for the matter of them be ſpiritual, are alſo ſpiritual in the effect, that they leave thee more humble, outed of thy ſelf, more depending upon Chriſt and his grace, more mortified to the world, and the temptations thereof. It may fall out that a mans religious duties be the ſtage up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which all a mans luſts do eminently act, as the Phariſees who did all things <hi>to be ſeen of men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We might be larger in giving you ſymptomatical differences, but becauſe they will fall in upon the ſeveral particulars, or in the next Doctrine about the ſigns <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> and characters of grace, I forbear, concluding with a Uſe of Exhortation, not to be too credulous and facile in believing our ſelves to be good and right. Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full may the coſenings and ſupplantations of thy own heart be. What may you not be? What may you not do, and yet be unſound? Oh how burdenſome will it be when men ſhall ſay, Lord, Have we not been enlarged in thy ſervice? Lord, Have we not mourned in thy preſence? Have we not rejoyced in the good Word that hath been preached to us? and yet God to return this, Inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as you did it not upon ſound and ſincere grounds, you did it not to me, <hi>Depart ye workers of iniquity.</hi> Draw off all your thoughts, diſputes, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from other points, and mind this one neceſſary thing. Thou diſputeſt, Whether there be a true Church, a true Miniſtery, true Ordinances, Oh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, Whether there be true grace in thy heart. The Phariſees kept the feaſt of purifications, or cleanſing of the Temple, but were foul and unclean in their own ſouls. As God declared his inviſible Attributes of wiſdom, power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the viſible works he did in the Creation of the world, ſo do thou mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that ſecret and hidden efficacy of Chriſt in thee, by a powerfull and vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life of godlineſs; Theſe are miracles that will confirm thee to come from God. Good is that of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> when pride tickleth thee and would puff thee up, ſay, <hi>Ovem te putas, hircum fortè novit te Deus,</hi> Thou thinkeſt thy ſelf a ſheep, but it may be God knoweth thee to be a goat; and again, when deſpair and unbelief aſſaults thee, ſay, <hi>Hircum te putas, ovem te fortè Deus novit.</hi> Thou thinkeſt thy ſelf a Goat, but God knoweth thee to be a ſheep it may be. Not as if we perſwaded you to doubting, or commended uncertainty, as the Papiſts do, but an holy fear and trembling to make our calling and election ſure, which the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth.</p>

                  <p>WE come to the ſecond Doctrine, which though implied only, yet is of neceſſary uſe. The Apoſtle preſſing them to try, whether they be in Chriſt, and in faith or no, doth thereby ſuppoſe, that there are ſuch ſigns and ſymptomes of this ſtate and condition, that a man diligently attending thereunto by the help of Gods Spirit, may come to be aſſured that he is in ſuch a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30767:21"/>
ſtate, for whereas <hi>Becanus</hi> the Papiſt would argue againſt Aſſurance from the Text, That the <hi>Corinthians</hi> were uncertain of their ſpiritual eſtate, otherwiſe it had been a vain thing and abſurd to exhort a man to examine himſelf about that of which he is certain; The anſwer is eaſie, That although they might <hi>de facto</hi> not have aſſurance, yet the Apoſtle his urging this upon them doth evidently ſuppoſe it poſſible, and not only ſo, but their duty to have it. Although none do hold ſuch a certainty in this life, as the Saints in Heaven have, which exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth all weakneſſes; Therefore the certainty Gods people do reach unto hath its degrees, and doth admit of changes.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrine,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There are ſuch characters and ſigns of the ſtate of grace laid down in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſerv. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>that a godly man by the faithfull application of them to himſelf, being thereunto guided and inabled by the Spirit of God, may be aſſured that he is in ſuch a ſtate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Doctrine there are three main particulars muſt be ſpoken unto and open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: 1. Aſſurance and Certainty: 2. The Signs and Marks of Grace: 3. The work of Gods Spirit in this; and much excellent practical matter will flow from every one of theſe fountains; and marvel not if I be large ere this ſubject be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly finiſhed, for it is a ſubject of the greateſt concernment that may be, and if men be willing to ſpend ſo much time and coſt in evidencing their Titles and Proprieties in Land or earthly Goods, how diligent ſhould we be about hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly!</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore firſt ſpeak to the matter of Aſſurance or Certainty; and for <note place="margin">Twelve Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions about Aſſurance. 1.</note> this take notice of theſe particulars,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, A Certainty or Aſſurance may be had of a thing divers waies, as <hi>There is a certainty of ſenſe,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Thomas</hi> deſired to have by putting his fingers into Chriſts wounds; and this Philoſophers ſay is infallible about its proper object, if there be no defect or impediment in the ſenſitive faculty.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>There is a certainty of Science or Knowledge,</hi> and that is either of firſt principles which are aſſented unto by all, without any diſcourſe or debate at all, or elſe of ſuch concluſions as are deduced from thoſe principles.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>There is a certainty ariſing from the Authority of thoſe who do declare or witneſſe ſuch things;</hi> for the teſtimony of him whom I believe to be the ſupream truth and infallible about ſuch or ſuch things, doth beget a firm and ſure per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion that they are true; now this Authority is two-fold, <hi>either Humane;</hi> and as the men who witneſſe are for number few or leſſe, or for quality more or leſſe worthy of credit, ſo more or leſſe is that Certainty; and this breeds an humane faith, or moral certainty only (now it is much to be feared that the greateſt part of Proteſtants even in matters of Religion, have no more then this humane faith, believing upon no higher a motive then humane tradition, or the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of man,) <hi>or elſe it is Divine,</hi> from Gods authority and revelation, and this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets an undoubted aſſent, which cannot be over-maſtered by any contrary tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation. Hence it is that this certainty of faith is above all certainty of ſenſe or reaſon, becauſe the ground of it is more firm and immutable; and although the nature of things believed be far above our underſtandings (as in the doctrine of the Trinity and incarnation of Chriſt) yet the teſtimony of them is clear and evident, ſo that the certainty of faith may not be called obſcure, as Papiſts term it, but clear and evident; for that is true which <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſaith, No man belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth that which he doth not ſee to be credible, and therefore in every thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved there is <hi>evidentia credibilitatis,</hi> a clearneſs and evidence of the grounds why I do believe, though there be not alwaies <hi>evidentia rei,</hi> a clearneſs of the thing aſſented to; now if you ask, To what kinde of certainty is that reduced, which the people of God have about their being in Chriſt, and in the ſtate of grace; I anſwer it is a mixt or compounded certainty, partly a certainty of faith, and partly of ſenſe and in experience, which ſenſe is ſpiritual, and wrought by
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30767:22"/>
the Spirit of God in us, ſo that it doth farre tranſcend probable conjectures and moral perſwaſions ariſing in us, becauſe of ſuch bodily affections or diſpoſitions of joy and grief, which we ſometimes finde in our ſelves, and hypocrites alſo are many times made partakers thereof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>A man may be aſſured that the condition he liveth in is damnable, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. A man may be aſſured he is wicked.</note> 
                     <hi>ſuch a wicked man is to be aſſured of that as long as he continueth in that life, he is without the ſtate of grace:</hi> So that we may truly ſay to many the contrary in this Text, <hi>Examine your ſelves, try your ſelves, whether you be in the fleſh, and power of ſinne or no; Know ye not that the devil dwelleth and reigneth in you?</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal. 6. The works of the fleſh are manifest,</hi> and therefore ſuch who live in the practice and habitual cuſtome of groſſe ſins, may and ought to conclude unto their own ſouls that they are in the ſtate of gall and wormwood, and that they have no portion in Chriſt or his benefits; and O that ſuch would make ſuch pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical concluſions and judgements againſt their own ſelves, it might be an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual preparation to awaken and rouſe them out of their ſecurity, whereas through ſelf-flattery, and a groundleſſe perſwaſion of Gods mercy, they utterly deſtroy themſelves.</p>
                  <p>But although a man may for the preſent conclude that he is in a ſlate of ſinne <note place="margin">None can be ſure they are Reprobates.</note> and death, <hi>Yet none may aſſure themſelves that they are reprobated by God,</hi> and that they have ſuch ſigns upon them that they can never be ſaved, becauſe no man can come to ſuch a certainty out of the Scripture; and as for a particular revelation, as God doth not aſſure believers by any ſuch extraordinary way, much leſſe may we think he will the reprobate by that way. We therefore ſpeak of the preſent eſtate of a wicked man, let ſuch an one caſt up his accounts, come to a perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory concluſion how it is between God and his ſoul, do not live in vain hopes, be not as one that knoweth not what to do, or what will become of him, how many are there who on their death-beds cry out, Live they cannot, and die they dare not, though they muſt? Doſt thou not ſee the plague-tokens upon thy ſoul as yet? Are not thy oaths, thy luſts, thy neglect of holy duties a full demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that thy heart is barren of all grace?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is eaſier for a particular Church to know it is a true viſible Church, then for a particular Chriſtian to know that he is a true believer.</hi> For to a true viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">3.</note> Church are required only thoſe notes and marks which are external, as the pure preaching of the Word with an external ſubmiſſion unto it, or receiving of it, and where this is, a man may conclude there is a true viſible Church for the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of it; but to the truth of grace in a mans heart, there is required internal and ſecret operations of Gods Spirit by a powerful and moſt effectual change of a mans ſoul. Now as in the notes and marks of a true Church, ſome take general marks which are common to falſe Churches, as the Papiſts, Signs of univerſality, antiquity and temporal felicity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And again, Others they make the whole diſpute about the marks of a Church uſeleſſe and of no profit at all (as <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copius</hi> that Remonſtrant) ſo for the ſigns of grace, ſome are too large, and make thoſe things arguments of grace which any hypocrite may attain to, as Baptiſm, Morality, external conformity to Gods Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So others, as the Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, do wholly overthrow the Doctrine about ſigns of grace, and make it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together uſeleſſe to preach about them: but this is to be confuted in its time.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eſtius</hi> the Papiſt would make this exhortation of the Apoſtle in the Text, to be only for trial, Whether they were a true Church, and whether Chriſt dwelt in them by true Doctrine, Miracles and his Ordinances? But that cannot be the total meaning, partly, becauſe every believer had not Chriſt dwelling in him by Miracles, and therefore ſuch an one could not have acknowledged <hi>Pauls</hi> miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial power; and if ſo, then <hi>Paul</hi> would not have provoked to that, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this place, and that of <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 17. may explain one another; now there Chriſt is ſaid, <hi>To dwell in their hearts by faith,</hi> where it muſt needs be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying faith; and certainly Chriſt is in us, as we are in Chriſt, for <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. 10.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30767:22"/>
theſe are put together, now we are not in Chriſt by a faith of Miracles, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is not in us by ſuch a faith.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>No man can by any natural light or evidence in him, come to be aſſured</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. Aſſurance not a natural light.</note> 
                     <hi>of the grace wrought in his ſoul.</hi> Hence I ſhall ſhew you, that it is Gods Spirit which doth ſeal to us what we are; and that as a man cannot ſee the Sunne but by the light of the Sunne, ſo neither can he ſee Chriſt or his graces in him but by the Spirit of Chriſt. Hence a man may be in the ſtate of grace and not know it, even as the childe in the womb may be an heir to a great inheritance, and not underſtand it; and therefore as it is not the power of a mans free-will to ſubdue and conquer ſinne, but that belongs to the Spirit of God ſanctifying, ſo it is not the light of a mans natural underſtanding that can aſſure us of the things of God in us, but it belongs to the ſpirit of Adoption in us. Hence it is that a man na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally is deſtitute of all comfort, as well as grace, his heart is like an hell; as there is the unquenchable fire of luſt, which never goeth out, ſo there are worms of doubts and fears perpetually gnawing which never die. For the Promiſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divine and ſupernatural, we have no more inclination to them, or compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with them then the commands of God, which require holineſſe. Hence it is that as a man while unconverted doth reſiſt the Spirit of God, convincing and ſanctifying; ſo when converted and humbled for ſin he doth often refuſe Gods Spirit comforting and witneſſing his love to him. And hence is the ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat and conflict the people of God have, which is not only between corruption and holineſſe, but alſo between doubting and faith. Aſſurance therefore doth not follow the work of grace in us by a neceſſary conſequence, as heat doth the light of the fire, but is ſeparable from it, as we ſee in many of <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalmes, who though full of grace and holineſſe, yet was in darkneſſe, and felt not Gods preſence with him, or his love of him; and this ſhould make us keep with all fear and trembling any meaſure of Aſſurance that we have, ſeeing if we ſin it away we are no more able to call it into our ſouls again, then we can bid the Sunne ſtand ſtill in its race.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>There are four ſpecial priviledges and mercies that a Chriſtian even in this</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5. Four things Chriſtian m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> be aſſured of.</note> 
                     <hi>life may be aſſured of, his Election, Remiſſion of ſinne, Sanctification of his nature, and Perſerverance in that ſtate, with future glory at the end thereof.</hi> And the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our Sanctification or preſent grace muſt be the foundation for the other certainties; ſo that there can be no certainty of Predeſtination, of Juſtification, of Glorification, if there be not a certainty of Renovation in us. We therefore ought the more diligently to attend to this; for he that hath a falſe perſwaſion about his grace in him, hath alſo a falſe perſwaſion of his pardon of ſin, and of his Salvation, and ſo at laſt all his hopes will miſerably fail him. Tell me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou that haſt ſuch confidence that thy ſins are forgiven, ſuch boldneſſe as to hope for ſalvation, what works or fruit is there of ſanctifying grace; there you muſt begin, and you build in vain unleſſe this foundation be laid. Not that we are to truſt in our graces, but to gather Gods love by them as ſo many ſigns and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies, otherwiſe our certainty is <hi>in dignatione Dei,</hi> not <hi>in dignitate noſtra,</hi> ſaid <hi>Bernard;</hi> And <hi>Ambroſe, Non gloriabor quia juſtus ſum, ſed quia redemptus ſum; non gloriabor quia vacuus peccati ſum, ſed quia peccata mihi remiſſa ſunt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore ſixthly, <hi>It is a moſt ſad deluſion for an ungodly or unregenerated man to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>be perſwaded, his eſtate is an eſtate of grace, whenas indeed it is nothing but of ſinne and death.</hi> We pitie thoſe that are bewitched or poſſeſſed with devils, but this is the moſt terrible poſſeſſion, when a man is poſſeſſed with the devil turned into an Angel of light. Thus the Phariſees who blaſphemed ſometimes, ſaying, Chriſt had a devil, they themſelves were poſſeſſed with one; you are they that juſtifie your ſelves (ſaith our Saviour) now all are very prone to this corrupt judgment, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very mans ways are right in his own eyes</hi> (its the wiſe-mans Apophthegm) <hi>but the Lord pondereth the heart;</hi> and in this bewitchery moſt men lie. For who is there that is not confidently perſwaded of the goodneſs of their ſpiritual eſtate, who is not like
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30767:23"/>
                     <hi>Laodicea</hi> perſwaded of their riches and fulneſs, when indeed they are naked and empty. Oh therefore that ſuch had the ſpiritual eie-ſalve, that ſuch had their eies opened to judge righteous judgement. How great will thy confuſion be when thy gold ſhall be found droſs, thy wine water, thy graces corruption, and thy goodneſs nothing but ſin! Do not therefore give credit to thy deceitful heart. Be afraid leſt thy ſelf-love hath blinded thy eies and hardned thy heart, pray un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God that he would make known thy ſelf unto thy ſelf. The better thoughts thou haſt of thy ſelf, it may be, it is the worſe with thee; ſuch a righteouſneſſe and godlineſſe as ſatisfieth men like thy ſelf, is not preſently acceptable unto God. Men may live fourty or threeſcore years, and yet be great ſtrangers unto their hearts. We pitie thoſe deluded mad men, who are perſwaded they are ſuch great perſons, and have ſuch large eſtates, when in the mean time they lie miſerable and naked, bound up in chains in a dark dungeon; ſuch a ſpiritual madneſſe is upon moſt, who never ſearched to the bottom of all that filthineſſe which is in them, and thereupon call themſelves grapes and figs when they are thorns and thiſtles.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Conſider that the ſoul of man hath two kinds of acts or workings.</hi> The former are <hi>direct acts,</hi> ſuch as go immediatly to their <hi>object;</hi> as when by faith I <note place="margin">7.</note> take Chriſt and adhere to him; the latter are <hi>reflex acts,</hi> which are only in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſubjects, and this is when a man doth perceive and diſcern thoſe <hi>direct acts</hi> in him, as when I perceive that I do thus adhere to Chriſt, that I do love God. <hi>Now Certainty or Aſſurance is properly in this latter way, when we know that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">What Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is.</note> 
                     <hi>we believe;</hi> and therefore this Aſſurance it is called by ſome <hi>Senſus fidei,</hi> the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or perceiving of Faith. Now you muſt know that this feeling or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of Faith is from Gods Spirit as well as Faith it ſelf; ſo that it is not a meer humane ſenſe or diſcerning, which is ſubject to falſhoods and deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but is infallible, even as faith is; for as the Spirit of God cannot externally witneſs any thing that is falſe; ſo neither can it inwardly in the ſoul of a man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade of that which is falſe, ſo that as a man knoweth by the help of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <hi>His word to be the word of God,</hi> and is never fully confirmed till that come, ſo though a man may have probable hopes and conjectures of grace in his heart, yet he never comes to be ſetled, till the Spirit of God doth thus corroborate him.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, <hi>This Certainty a Believer hath cannot be made known or demonſtrated unto another, but remaineth unexpreſſible in his own heart.</hi> Even as a man cannot <note place="margin">8. A Believers aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance cannot be known to any other.</note> deſcribe unto another, what it is to be a father or a mother, only thoſe that are ſo, and feel the bowels of ſuch a relation, they can in themſelves feel what it is; and thus when a man becomes perſwaded of the truth of grace in his own ſoul, as differing from hypocrites, this cannot be diſcovered unto another, only the man himſelf reſts ſatisfied; Therefore its called, <hi>The white ſtone which none know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but he that hath it.</hi> As it is thus only known to a mans ſelf, ſo neither can others by a judgement of Certainty, but of charity only judge who are ſo. For it is God only that knoweth the hearts, and there is nothing viſible in Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which an hypocrite may not upon falſe grounds do, as well as the godly upon true, and if ſome did in the primitive times know what was in mens hearts, it was by a peculiar extraordinary revelation, not of cuſtomary diſcerning. And that diſcerning of ſpirits which was given to ſome in the Church, was in reſpect of Doctrines, to difference the true from the falſe, not of mens hearts and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: This is to be obſerved againſt that errour of ſome, that hold, A man may certainly know whether another be godly, <hi>Peter</hi> was deceived about <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,</hi> and he cals <hi>Sylvanus a faithful brother,</hi> as he ſuppoſeth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 12. It is true there is a great ſympathy and conformable working of Gods Spirit in godly men, and their hearts anſwer one another as the face in the glaſſe, but yet here is no infallibility, and many whom the godly have admired as ſtars, have fallen from heaven; and others whom they did not expect have remained firm to God.</p>

                     <hi>and certainty of them doth more depend upon Gods Spirit confirming us, then in the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the argument.</hi> Our Aſſurance doth conſiſt more in that firm adheſion of the ſubject, then in the evidence of the object. If you conſider it in thoſe aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive acts of faith, whereby we believe truths revealed in Scripture, their firmneſs and immovablenes doth more depend upon the work of Gods Spirit ſtrengthning the inward man, then upon the arguments; hence it doth believe them even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Martyrdom, though it be not able to anſwer all the objections brought againſt it; and thus it is in theſe reflexive acts, the confidence that a Believer hath of the truth of grace wrought in him, comes more from Gods Spirit removing our ſlaviſh fears and bondage diſpoſition, as alſo ſtaying and ſupporting the ſoul, then from that excellency and beauty of grace which is within us.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, <hi>Conſider that as a man in his animal or rational life doth perceive the</hi>

                     <hi>motions of his ſenſitive and rational ſoul, ſo doth a Believer in his ſupernatural feel the motions of his ſpiritual life.</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 14. <hi>We know we are tranſlated from death to life, becauſe we love the brethren;</hi> a place much to be inſiſted upon hereafter. In this Text are two things, the firſt is general, <hi>Thoſe that love the brethren are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated from death to life;</hi> The ſecond is more particular, we love the brethren, and therefore know we are tranſlated from death to life; ſo that as he who hath fire in his boſom, he feels that heat within him; Thus he that loveth God, feeleth the motions of love within him, ſo that as a man as ſenſitive doth perceive the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſenſe within him, thus doth a man ſpiritual feel infallibility the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural motions of an heavenly life within him, yet here is this difference, a man doth diſcern bitter from ſweet, and a ſeeing man white from black without any temptation or oppoſition at all, but it is not ſo in ſupernatural motions.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, <hi>It is a vain thing to diſtinguiſh between the certainty of Hope, and a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">11.</note> 
                     <hi>certainty of Faith, as if a man might have a certain Hope of Grace and Godlineſſe in him, but not a certain Faith,</hi> for the firmneſſe of Hope doth depend only upon the certainty of faith; So that where there is no certainty of Faith, there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any firmneſſe of Hope. It is true, a man may have a ſtrong deſire of that which he hath no certain Faith for, but that deſire cannot be called Hope, and this is more eſpecially true in divine Hope, which <hi>makes not aſhamed,</hi> and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe it is the fruit of Faith, which is built upon the Promiſe and word of God; what Certainty therefore Faith hath it doth tranſmit to Hope; and as God hath placed ſuch a natural Affection as Hope in a man, to bear him up againſt all the difficulties he meeteth with for the obtaining of the good he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, ſo he hath placed a ſupernatural frame in the heart to ſupport the ſoul till it obtaineth thoſe good things it believeth to have.</p>

                  <p>THis Text (as is proved) is a ſure foundation of that profitable and neceſſary Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> The Certainty that a godly man may have of that Grace which is wrought in him, I come to adde two more Propoſitions, which may further declare the nature of this Truth,</p>
                  <p>As firſt, <hi>There are three things when we ſpeak of Certainty, that are confounded by ſome Divines, and accurately distinguiſhed by others;</hi> and they are <hi>Fides, Fiducia,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">13.</note> and <hi>Certitudo, Faith, Affiance</hi> or <hi>Confidence,</hi> and <hi>Aſſurance.</hi> In the writings of many Authors theſe are ſpoken of promiſcuouſly, as the ſame thing; yea Faith is by many learned men defined to be a full perſwaſion of the heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which definition though it was maintained by them out of a good intent againſt all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh doubtings, yet it is not a Truth in the thing; for many have Faith, yea ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying Faith, who have none of this Aſſurance; and this definition hath plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged many tender Conſciences into ſad Labyrinths, as if they had no Faith at all, becauſe no Aſſurance at all: But of this more hereafter. Others therefore ſpeak more diſtinctly, and alſo conſonantly to that place of Scripture, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 11. where Faith in Chriſt is ſaid to have three effects, 1. Affiance or Confidence. 2. Boldneſs or Aſſurance, and both theſe come from Faith. 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of acceſſe to call upon God in times of adverſities, ſo that a believer is made Gods favourite, and it is not againſt Law (as <hi>Esthers</hi> was) to go in and ſpeak to this great King. Now whether Faith, Confidence and Aſſurance differ onely as ſo many degrees; as a Childe, a Youth and a Man; or whether they differ as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral kinds, is to ſubtil a diſpute. This is certain, That unleſſe our Faith go ſo far as in a ſpecial manner to apply Chriſt to us, it cannot juſtifie us, or do us any good: Others were in the croud beſides <hi>the woman that had the bloudy flux,</hi> but ſhe <hi>touching of him</hi> did partake of vertue from him. Though an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> had look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon all other Objects as well as the brazen Serpent, yet beholding that only did cure him; So though our Faith be carried out to the whole Word of God, yet it is the applying and reſting upon Chriſt that doth juſtifie us: Let not then a gracious heart deſpair as if it had no intereſt in Chriſt, becauſe it hath not yet attained to Aſſurance, God that hath begun to make thee deſire Chriſt, that hath ſupported thee under thy fears and guilt, will at laſt give thee Aſſurance; for God beſtoweth theſe mercies by degrees, even as <hi>Boaz</hi> did to <hi>Ruth;</hi> he firſt gave her gleanings, then her meals, and laſtly his own ſelf. God may come unto thee in mighty ruſhing winds before he come in a ſtill quiet voice, <hi>Nil tam cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, quam quod ex dubio certum,</hi> nothing is ſo certain, as that which is ſo after doubting. The ſhaking of the Trees by mighty windes, doth make the root
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:30767:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
more firm, and ſo may theſe temptations be a foundation of greater joy and boldneſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The Aſſurance Gods people have of their eſtate of grace, is not ſo high</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">14.</note> 
                     <hi>and full as that it excludes all doubting,</hi> for there is nothing Perfect in us in this life, whether it be Duty or Conſolation, but as <hi>the Fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit</hi> in regard of Sanctification, ſo it doth alſo in reſpect of Conſolation; We ſee <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſubject to many Convulſion-fits, his <hi>Pſalms</hi> ſometimes diſcover Confidence and Aſſurance, ſometimes again Dejection and great Diffidence, ſo that <hi>Samſon</hi> with his Hair grown, and his Hair cut, doth not more differ from himſelf in ſtrength and weakneſs, then <hi>David</hi> doth. We do not therefore maintain or plead for ſuch an Aſſurance that excludeth all Doubting, all Conflicts and Agonies, ſuch as the glorified Saints in Heaven have, but ſuch a certainty as is grievouſly aſſault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Satan the Prince of darkneſs, and by the unbelief of our own hearts; and although we make Doubting as a grievous ſin, yet we ſay it cannot be avoided, becauſe of that remainder of corruption which is ſtill in us, inſomuch that it's a received Maxim in Practical Divinity, grounded alſo upon Scripture, That he which never Doubted never Believed; as he that will ſay he is never Proud, it is a ſign he was never Humble; now the ground of this Truth is from that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of ſinne that is ſtill in every man; ſo that he can neither do any Duty, or partake of any Comfort without the dregs of corruption; there is the leaven of ſinne that doth ſowr both. There is ſome Gall in all our Honey; and by this means godly Aſſurance (as is to be ſhewed) doth differ from all that carnal confidence and preſumption which is in wicked men; and we may juſtly ſay to them that which <hi>Iſaac</hi> did to <hi>Jacob,</hi> when he brought his counterfeit Veniſon, <hi>How comeſt thou by it ſo ſoon?</hi> This Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> is not ſo eaſily poſſeſſed, yea as the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> did moſt oppreſſe the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> when they were getting out of their power, ſo doth the Devil moſt buffet and aſſault thoſe who have eſcaped his ſnares: And as the Trees that are fulleſt of fruit have their boughes moſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; ſo the people of God that carry about with them the richeſt Treaſures of Gods Grace, have the greateſt encounters from Satan. We read the Devil tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pting Chriſt upon this very Point, <hi>Whether he were the Son of God.</hi> It is no wonder then if he do frequently try thy ſtrength and comfort. Beſides, the failing in our Duties is a ground of coming ſhort in our Comforts. Hence commonly the moſt active Chriſtian hath the greateſt Comfort, and he that walketh looſly and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zily, is fulleſt of Doubts; as the waters that runne ſwiftly breed no vermine, no croaking Frogs, but thoſe that are ſluggiſh, and are conſtagnated in a Pool.</p>
                  <p>Before we come to the practical Queſtions about this Aſſurance of Grace, we <note place="margin">The Adjuncts of Aſſurance. I. The Poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it. 1.</note> will conſider theſe Adjuncts of it. 1. <hi>The Poſſibility of it. 2. The Excellency of it. 3. The Difficulty of it. 4. The Neceſſity of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The Poſſibility of it is ſeen, in that the people of God have enjoyed it.</hi> When <hi>David</hi> doth ſo often call God <hi>his God and his Portion,</hi> acknowledging with joy and thankfulneſſe that he had forgiven his ſins, doth not this ſuppoſe a Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? When that man ſaid, <hi>O Lord, I believe,</hi> Did he ſpeak he knew not what? And <hi>Paul,</hi> how often doth he manifeſt ſuch an Aſſurance! and leſt it ſhould be thought he had it by ſome ſpecial Revelation, he doth <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. inferre this Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from thoſe grounds, which are common to all the people of God, do not therefore think it impoſſible, ſaying, Who will go up to Heaven and bring a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation for me, that God is my God? for thou haſt the ſame wayes to obtain it, as the people of God have had heretofore.</p>
                  <p>Again ſecondly, <hi>The Poſſibility of it is ſeen in that a man may be aſſured of his</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>dogmatical Faith;</hi> That is, a man may be aſſured that he doth believe ſuch Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Religion upon a divine ground; and if ſo, why not alſo that he loveth God and his children upon true Motives; as alſo that his Repentance hath all
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:30767:25"/>
true Ingredients into it. And indeed if a man could not tell whether he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve upon ſupernatural grounds, he could not truly but upon a bold venture ſay, he did believe in God in deed, that there is a Church of God, or a Reſurrection of our bodies.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Poſſibility of it appeareth from the Inſtitution of Sacraments, as Signs and Seals particularly to witneſſe Gods love to us;</hi> So that as the appointing <note place="margin">3.</note> of Seals among men doth argue an intent of making bargains and contracts ſure: Thus God appointing Sacraments in a viſible particular Application, doth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by declare his Will, that his Children ſhould be ſure; ſo that to overthrow Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance is to take away the Sacraments; As a man doth prize that wax which is made up in a ſeal to confirm his inheritance to him, more then all the wax in the world; ſo do Chriſtians look upon bread and wine conſecrated and ſet apart for that uſe of ſignification and obſignation of the benefits of Chriſt, more then all other bread and wine.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>If Aſſurance were not poſſible, the defect would be either in the Object, or in the Means to attain it, or in the Subject.</hi> In the Object there can be no defect, <note place="margin">4.</note> as all ſay, for Gods <hi>Promiſes are in Chriſt Yea and Amen;</hi> and no iota or tittle of Gods Word in the promiſing part of it, can any more paſſe away, then in the preceptive or threatning part of it. Then there can be no defect in the means to obtain it; for there is the Spirit of God efficiently to work it; There are the Sacraments appointed on purpoſe to confirm us; There are Miniſters to inſtruct and inform about it. Neither is there any defect in the ſubject, for although the heart of a man be naturally deceitfull and full of crafty wickedneſs, ſo that the Scripture cals him a fool who truſteth in it; yet being now renewed by Gods Spirit, that guile and hypocriſie is in a great meaſure removed, and he doth not ſee and diſcern by his own ſtrength meerly, but by the Spirit of God enabling and guiding of him; So that as Gods Spirit working by the Law, doth convince a man in particular of his ſins, filleth him with deſpair of himſelf and every thing he doth, makes him to ſee he is an undone and a loſt man; ſo the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit through the Promiſe of the Goſpel, doth perſwade us of Gods love, revealing it outwardly in the Word, and ſhedding it abroad inwardly in our hearts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Neceſſity of it appeareth, 1. <hi>From the Nature of Faith.</hi> It <note place="margin">II. The Neceſſity of it. 1.</note> is of an eſtabliſhing and ſetling Nature. It is a Pillar and an Anchor to the ſoul, and although Aſſurance is a ſeparable effect from it, yet the Scripture makes Doubting and Fear to be oppoſite to believing. Hence is truſting in God compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to rolling our ſelves upon him, to ſtaying the minde, to reſting of the heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that by ſtrong and cuſtomary Acts of believing on Chriſt, and patiently waiting, we come at laſt to be aſſured.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>There is a Neceſſity from Gods Glory.</hi> It is not enough that God doth work Grace in us, and ſanctifie us; but we are to know this, that we may praiſe and <note place="margin">2.</note> bleſſe God for it: Can a man in his ſleep, or in a ſwound, when his ſenſes are ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified, praiſe God that he liveth? no more can a Chriſtian ſtaggering with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties, and lying in all darkneſſe of minde: how therefore ſhould this quicken us up to obtain this Mercy! How much Glory doth God loſe by thy fears! As <hi>David</hi> argued, <hi>Doe the dead praiſe thee?</hi> So doe thou ſay, O Lord, Do they in darkneſſe and that have no light, glorifie thee for thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to them!</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Hereby we ſhall have more Joy and Peace in our hearts:</hi> Oh what an Hell muſt every mans heart be that hath not ſome little light at leaſt of this in <note place="margin">3.</note> his Soul? What Legions of tormenting Doubts muſt needs poſſeſſe him, till he have ſome ſupport this way? How can a man be ſick, be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, be under the ſtroke of death, who hath no knowledge of any Good that God hath wrought in him? See how this ſupported <hi>Hezekiah</hi> in his
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:30767:25"/>
ſickneſſe, <hi>Remember, O Lord, how I have walked before thee with a true heart.</hi> And thus <hi>Paul</hi> is animated to look Death in the face, becauſe he knew <hi>He had fought a good fight:</hi> and is not this the complaint of many languiſhing on their death-beds? Oh if they had Aſſurance, how willingly could they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part out of this world!</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>In the Uſefulneſſe of it, hereby we ſhall be enlarged and quickned up to all</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>holy Duties. He that hath this Hope purifieth himſelf, even as God is pure,</hi> 1 John 3. 3. And <hi>Having theſe Promiſes,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>viz.</hi> of God being our God, and we his people, <hi>Let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſſe of fleſh and ſpirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 1. We believe, therefore we ſpeak; and therefore it is an opinion againſt manifeſt Experience, that Aſſurance of Gods Love will beget Preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and carnal Security, whereas indeed this will be like fire in our bowels, wings to our Souls: Doth not the Childes Knowledge and Aſſurance that his Father loves him, beget all willingneſſe, and readineſſe of Obedience? And is not the Rule, <hi>Si vis amari, ama, Love if thou wouldst be loved?</hi> When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Soul ſhall be perſwaded that God in great Love hath wrought ſuch mercies for him, Will not this make him ſeven times more enflamed to God?</p>
                  <p>In the third place, <hi>We have the Difficulty,</hi> few do attain unto it, and that from <note place="margin">III. The difficulty of getting Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance. 1.</note> theſe grounds,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Where the ſenſe and feeling of the guilt of ſinne is, there we preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly look upon God as an Enemy, think of him as of a Man that cannot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, but will certainly avenge.</hi> Thus <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> how prone were they to deſpair! And therefore the word to <hi>Aſſure,</hi> 1 John 3. 19. ſignifieth <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade,</hi> implying that our Hearts have many froward and peeviſh Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections; and we are many times as <hi>Rachel mourning, and would not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It ariſeth from the deſperate Hypocriſie and falſeneſſe of our Hearts.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> This is urged by the Papiſts too farre, as if it were ſuch a Deep, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God alſo could not aſſure us what we are; but thus farre it manifeſteth, That Comfort or Aſſurance is not a Flower that groweth in our Garden, but if the Spirit of God ſhould not both work Grace in us, and give us eyes to diſcern it, we ſhould remain in a dark Chaos.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>It ariſeth from our proneneſſe to walk negligently and careleſly.</hi> We <note place="margin">3.</note> are beaten down with many Temptations, and therefore do quickly loſe our hopes; for this Aſſurance is preſerved in the continual exerciſe of Grace.

                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>It is Difficult from outward Cauſes, as</hi> firſt <hi>from Satan,</hi> who <hi>hath fiery</hi>

                     <hi>Darts, is a Manſlayer from the beginning,</hi> and endeavours to keep in doubts and fears, that ſo at laſt we may be even wearied out, and rage againſt God. When the Devil cannot hinder us in our Duties, he doth it in our Comforts and Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; as the Spirit of God is the Comforter, becauſe of that ſpecial benefit it brings to the people of God; So the Devil is the Tempter, and watcheth the opportunity to throw bitter wormwood into every condition we are in: As the Pirates do beſet and wait for thoſe ſhips that are fulleſt of gold, and other trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; yea therefore never are wicked men caſt down with thoſe fears and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles as the godly are; They know not the meaning of ſpiritual Temptations, nor what it is to have the light of Gods countenance denied them.</p>

great and vehement enquiry after him, and cannot finde him. Though it ariſe not from the Doctrine of Aſſurance, to make us careleſs and negligent; yet ſometimes this may be abuſed through our corruption.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Here is the Excellency of this Priviledge</hi> ſeveral wayes;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>This keeps up excellent Fellowſhip and Acquaintance with God.</hi> The Church <note place="margin">IIII. The excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge. 1.</note> that could ſay, <hi>I am my welbeloveds, and my welbeloved is mine,</hi> did abound in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Society with Chriſt: Hence the Church glorieth in this expreſſion four or five times; whereas fears and doubts keep us aloof off, and make us ſlaviſhly trembling about him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It will work a Filial and an Evangelical frame of heart.</hi> The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <note place="margin">2.</note> of Adoption enabling us to call God Father, makes us alſo have the humble diſpoſition of Sons; Hereby we are carried out to do him ſervice for pure intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and motives.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>It will ſupport, although there be nothing but outward miſery and trouble.</hi> In thoſe times when we cannot be aſſured of any thing, ſuch as theſe are, not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured <note place="margin">3.</note> of our eſtates, ſafety or lives; yet if aſſured of the grace of God wrought in our ſouls, this will be like a wall of Marble that cannot be beaten down. Thus <hi>Rom. 8. Paul</hi> triumpheth over all difficulties upon this ground.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>It will much enflame in Prayer, when we are aſſured of Gods love.</hi> This <note place="margin">4.</note> kindles Deſires, encreaſeth Hopes to ſpeed, and ſo makes the Soul more importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; and in this reſpect <hi>David</hi> doth encourage himſelf in prayer many times: <hi>If Experience breeds Hope,</hi> much more will Aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>It makes a man walk with much tenderneſſe againſt ſinne;</hi> As being that only evil, which would put him out of the heaven he is in, for having now the <note place="margin">5.</note> Experience how <hi>ſweet the Lord is,</hi> and how greatly his favour is to be prized, he will take heed that he do not rob himſelf of ſo great a treaſure as that is. How do men fear to diſpleaſe thoſe who can if they will, keep all their earthly Evidences from them? and ſhall we not much rather God, who can deny us our heavenly Evidence?</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>His heart will be impatient and earneſt till the coming of Chriſt.</hi> When he ſhall have a full poſſeſſion and accompliſhment of all Glory, <hi>I deſire to depart,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> ſaith <hi>Paul, and to be with Chriſt.</hi> If the beginnings be thus wonderful and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, What will Heaven it ſelf be, when all fears ſhall be abandoned! If <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid of his wiſe man, <hi>Majore parte illic eſt, unde deſcendit,</hi> He is more in Heaven then in Earth; this is much more true of the godly.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>A full acquieſcency and reſting in God and Chriſt,</hi> as ſufficient for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kinde of want, ſo as <hi>They deſire nothing in Heaven but him, and nothing in Earth</hi>

                  <p>IN the next place we are to conſider, <hi>What are the Characteriſtical Differences between Aſſurance and Preſumption?</hi> You have heard it to be the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion and madneſs that can be, to have a falſe perſwaſion of our eſtate, as if ſound and godly, when its the contrary; and yet the greateſt part of Chriſtians are delivered up to ſuch a carnal confidence, and are like that mad <hi>Athenian</hi> who thought all the Ships on the Sea were his. How many are there, who when they hear the exact Diſcoveries that are made of Grace, whereby they may evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently conclude, That they are for the preſent ſhut out of this Kingdom, do yet bleſſe themſelves, as if all were well with them! It is therefore worth the while to ranſack ſuch falſe Evidences, to diſcover between Droſſe and Gold, Honey and Gall, what is of the Fleſh and what is of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place, <hi>We may finde a vaſt Difference in the efficient cauſe or principle</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The difference between true Aſſurance and Preſumption. 1. In the cauſe.</note> 
                     <hi>that is procreant of the one and the other.</hi> And although cauſes are like the root un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ground, not ſo viſible, yet they make much to the differencing of things. Aſſurance is a Fruit, whoſe Root is in Heaven, the Spirit of God in a two-fold act, Enlightening or Revealing, and Adopting or Corroborating the heart with Filiall Evangelical Affections; but carnal preſumption is a ruſh that groweth in the pudled mire of our own hearts; There being theſe internal cauſes that give life and breath to it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>An ignorance with an unexperienced apprehenſion of the depth of ſinne, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Internal cauſes of preſumption 1.</note> 
                     <hi>danger thereby.</hi> They have never yet with <hi>Paul</hi> found the Law alive, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves dead; They have not ſeen the great abominations of their Nature; The foulneſs of ſinne, the purity of the Law, the exactneſs of Gods juſtice; and for want of theſe Diſcoveries and Apprehenſions, they come quickly to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that every thing is well with them; This was <hi>Pauls</hi> caſe, he was alive before theſe thoughts came into him, he had great confidence in himſelf; and generally this was the ſtate of the Phariſees who juſtified themſelves, and the Jews who truſted in their own righteouſneſs, not that there was any ground for them ſo to do, but only they were blinde and ignorant, not knowing themſelves, as thoſe of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> who thought themſelves rich and full, when they were poor and miſerable: So that the preſumption of unregenerate men ariſeth from the ſtupidity and blindeneſs in them; whereas the godly Aſſurance is wrought out of a gracious Illumination about the heighth, depth and breadth of ſinne, with a tender affection about the weight and burden of it. Art thou then one who preſumeſt of the love of God, and reſteſt in the goodneſs of thy heart? know, that if thou wert acquainted with all the wounds ſinne hath made upon thee, if thy eyes were opened to perceive the filthineſs and vileneſs of thy nature and wayes, thou wouldſt ſit like <hi>Job</hi> upon the dunghill, abhorring and loathing thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:30767:27"/>
Secondly, <hi>Another internal cauſe is ſelf-love;</hi> that is, the Ivy which cleaveth <note place="margin">2.</note> ſo cloſe unto us, till it hath devoured our ſubſtance; by this means we flatter our ſelves, making everything to be good within us, and to be God, whereas it's altogether fleſhly and carnal. The wiſe-man obſerveth it, <hi>That every mans wayes are clean in his own eyes, but God pondereth the heart. Quiſquis ſe excuſat ſibi, accuſat Deo,</hi> Whoſoever doth excuſe and acquit himſelf to himſelf, doth accuſe himſelf to God. This was alſo the epidemical diſeaſe of the Jews, what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet could perſwade them their hearts were not right with God? Who could bring them out of love with themſelves? Art thou therefore fully perſwaded of thy good eſtate? Doſt thou bleſſe God for thy good heart and affections? Whence is the ground of this? Is it not from ſelf-flattery and a carnal love to thy ſelf? If thou wert diligent and obſerving of thy ſelf, this would be found indeed the real ground of all thy carnal confidence; Whereas a godly Aſſurance ariſeth from an utter diſplicency, and loathing of our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond vaſt Difference is, <hi>From the Motives and Grounds.</hi> The godly Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <note place="margin">II. In the motives and grounds.</note> is from and through the word of God; That which is the means of our Regeneration, is alſo of our Aſſurance, <hi>That we through the Scriptures might have comfort,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. whereas a vain preſumption comes from baſe and unworthy motives, As</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>A meer naturall light and judgement about the ſtate of Regeneration and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                     <hi>Grace;</hi> but (as you heard) Aſſurance comes by the light of the Spirit ſhining in Gods word, and the works of Grace in our hearts can be no more diſcerned by a natural light, then the ſenſitive part can apprehend the actings and workings of reaſon, or the natural faculty of the Will have power to do that which is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturally good. We ſee a clear inſtance in <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> how blockiſh was he about the work of Regeneration? Now this is the Motive of moſt mens Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, their groſs miſtake about the work of Grace what it is. Do not the moſt of men think this Godlineſs conſiſtent with frequent and conſtant Practices of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties and daily neglect of holy Duties? How many ſay, They have a good heart, notwithſtanding their bad tongues and lives? But if they are not ſo groſſe as to be deluded herein, Do not many take a fair, civil and moral Converſation, void of ſcandal, to be the Scripture-godlineſs, and becauſe they are ſo, though they have no more, are therefore perſwaded of their ſanctified condition? Nay, a mans miſtake may yet go farre higher, <hi>viz.</hi> when they take thoſe workings of Gods Spirit which are but for a ſeaſon, or are in ſome imperfect and ſhort De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, being without root in the ſoul, for the peculiar ſaving work of Grace, which is in the truly regenerated only. Now how eaſie is to be deceived one of theſe wayes, and with the fooliſh Virgins <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. to die confidently, and boldly go to meet the Bridegroom, when yet they want oil? See therefore if the Motive of thy Aſſurance be not an abſolute miſtake about the nature of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying Grace.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Motive of a godly Aſſurance is not from any Worth, Merit or Perfection</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>we deem in our ſelves, but only from the Truth and Sincerity of Grace, with many defects that are waſhed away by Christs bloud.</hi> Hence <hi>Paul, Though he knew nothing by himſelf, yet he was not thereby justified.</hi> Therefore the Popiſh deſcription of their Hope making it to ariſe partly from the merits of Chriſt, and partly from their own merits, is bold Preſumption. We do not defend ſuch an Aſſurance as ſhall ariſe from a full and perfect Obedience unto Gods Law; (nay we have an Aſſurance, ſuch an Obedience cannot be in this life) but only a certain perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the uprightneſſe of our hearts in the wayes of God. Now the Popiſh Arguments, they militate againſt Aſſurance chiefly upon this ground, <hi>Becauſe none can ſay, he hath a clean heart, and that in many things we offend.</hi> Theſe places argue indeed ſtrongly againſt a perfection in this life, but not againſt a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Aſſurance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>A carnal Preſumption ariſeth many times from the outward comforts and plenty</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note>
                     <pb n="29" facs="tcp:30767:27"/>
                     <hi>they enjoy.</hi> They look upon their Riches, Children, Honours, as ſo many Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of Gods Love to them, and Arguments of the Reward of their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. Becauſe the Scripture hath many temporal Promiſes unto thoſe that walk in Gods waies, they finding themſelves bleſſed with ſuch advantages, do thencefrom infer their Piety. But the Scripture gives many Antidotes againſt this tumor and ſwelling, telling us that ſuch ſtand in <hi>ſlippery places,</hi> yea that theſe things may become a ſnare unto them, encreaſing both their ſinne and torment. <hi>Quandoque divitae dantur ad poenam,</hi> ſaid <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerved, <hi>Riches, for the hurt of the owners.</hi> That place in <hi>Eccleſiaſtes, No man knoweth love, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred by theſe things below,</hi> doth not, as the Papiſts would have it, prove no Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance at all, but no Aſſurance by outward mercies and favours, <hi>Dives received his good things in this life, and Lazarus evil things; but a genuine Aſſurance that is moſt powerfull and operative in all outward diſtreſſes and miſeries.</hi> You ſee it in <hi>David</hi> by ſome of his <hi>Pſalms,</hi> how confident in God, when all outward things did witneſſe the contrary! Thus <hi>Hezekiah</hi> when under the ſtroke of death, is ſupported with the truth of Grace in his ſoul: but all carnal confidence vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in time of diſtreſſe, they then rage and rave, not knowing what to do; See then what it is that beareth up thy heart, that keeps up thy Spirit: Is it thy Wealth, thy Eſtate? Alas, how are theſe things beſtowed many times upon thoſe whom God hates, if theſe go to happineſs then Chriſt was not happy, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came poor that we might be rich? It was well obſerved by <hi>Auguſtin, That God giveth Riches ſometimes to wicked men, that we may not think they are good in themſelves; and ſometimes he giveth them to godly men, that we may not think them evil in themſelves.</hi> God may give thee theſe things, and not Chriſt, but if he giveth us Chriſt, how ſhall he not with him give us all things elſe?</p>
                  <p>The third Difference is <hi>In reſpect of the Manner and Method the Spirit of God</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">III. In the manner and method of Gods working Aſſurance.</note> 
                     <hi>doth uſually work Aſſurance.</hi> For although <hi>The winde bloweth where it liſt,</hi> and Gods waies are many times diverſified unto his people, yet commonly as <hi>Face an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth face,</hi> ſo do the hearts of Gods people one another; Inſomuch that what is <hi>Communis ſenſus fidelium,</hi> though it be not like Scripture, yet is of grave and ſerious Authority, now in theſe wayes the people of God come to have Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>By a deep and ſerious Humiliation for ſin, and feeling the burden of it.</hi> Matth. <note place="margin">1.</note> 11. ſuch only are promiſed to <hi>finde reſt in their ſouls;</hi> Chriſt did not aſſure <hi>Mary Magdalen Her ſins were forgiven,</hi> till <hi>ſhe wept much</hi> for them. We do not limit this to any time or degree of Humiliation, but unto the truth of it. Come we then to a man who is confident of all things, as well with him; Oh, But what travails hath thy ſoul had before the joy of ſuch a man-childe born unto thee. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. The Spirit of God, is <hi>a ſpirit of bondage,</hi> before it is a <hi>ſpirit of Adoption.</hi> And this very particular is enough to ſhake the foundations of many mens build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. What deep digging was there in thy heart before this ſuperſtruction? I know this true and ſafe practical Divinity is rejected by ſome upſtart flaſhie ſpirits, who turn Religion into Notions and Opinions. But <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 7. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. doth fully deſcribe ſuch a progreſſe and method upon himſelf; firſt, The diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of ſin by the Law, whereby he judged himſelf miſerable and out of meaſure ſinfull, and then the apprehenſion of Chriſts Grace upon this. This Aſſurance will not grow upon an heart not ploughed up. The Needle muſt pierce the heart before this ſilk can follow.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Another Method whereby God worketh Aſſurance, is by conflicts of doubts, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>oppoſition of unbelief.</hi> For ſeeing that Aſſurance is a fruit of Gods Spirit, and doubting a working of the fleſh, it cannot be but the Apoſtles ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> muſt be made good, <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh.</hi> I like not the Aſſurance that never doubted; it is like the temper of that man, who ſaid, <hi>All theſe have I kept from my youth.</hi> It cannot be thought that ſo great and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:30767:28"/>
a mercy ſhould be brought into thy ſoul, and thy heart not be in many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions. Apprehenſions of Grace in us, accompanied with ſenſe and feeling of our imperfections are alwaies good ſymptoms, as in that man, <hi>Lord, I believe</hi> (there was his Aſſurance of Grace in him) <hi>help my unbelief,</hi> There was a perceiving of his defects. As <hi>David</hi> hath ſometimes the Sunſhine of Gods favour, and it's clear with him; ſo at other times he is in the dark, and much wavering.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>God worketh Aſſurance out of the vehement and fiery aſſaults of Satan.</hi> As <note place="margin">3.</note> Chriſt himſelf eſcaped not his Arrows; ſo neither do his members. Wo to that man whoſe peace the Devil doth not diſquiet. The ſtrong one who is the Devil kept all things in quiet, till Chriſt the ſtronger come. As the Baſilisk hateth the very picture of a man; ſo doth the Devil oppoſe the reſemblance of Chriſt. Think therefore that vain Preſumption, and not godly Aſſurance, which is not oppoſed by hell it ſelf. It is an <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> not an <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> if <hi>Pharaoh</hi> do not oppreſſe him.</p>
                  <p>A fourth real Difference is <hi>In the Effects of godly Aſſurance, whereby it doth as</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">IIII. In the effects of godly Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>much out ſtrip Preſumption as light doth darkneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>This godly Aſſurance is diligent in the uſe of the means,</hi> carefull to perform all Duties, and in the neglect of theſe it either periſheth, or is much weakned, <hi>Give all diligence</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>to make your calling and election ſure,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 10. So that where Diligence, and all Diligence is not uſed, there is no Aſſurance. This is the Oil which keeps the Lamp burning; in earneſt Prayer, holy uſe of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, walking univerſally in all Gods wayes, is this godly certainty maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; whereas carnal confidence is big, and ſwelling even in the neglect, yea pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane contempt of the means. A man that doth not pray, that polluteth himſelf with daily ſins, yet he is throughly perſwaded of his happineſs. As therefore in the ordinary paſſages of Gods Providence, he is rightly judged a preſumer who will perſwade himſelf of life, when yet he will neither eat or drink, be aſſured of wealth and riches, when yet he will uſe no Diligence: ſuch an arrogant ſottiſhneſs is in a ſpiritual preſumer.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Godly Aſſurance the more it is, the more doth it inflame the heart with love to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>God.</hi> It is like the burning Glaſſe that by the reflection of the Sun-beams doth cauſe a fire to be kindled within, as we told you of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul;</hi> and none do ſo highly bleſſe God and praiſe him, as thoſe that have this Aſſurance: but carnal preſumption worketh into a love of the creature, or comforts he enjoyes, and careth the leſſe for God. As the Adultereſſe the more confident ſhe is of her husbands love, the more bold and impudent ſhe is to abuſe it. The Spirit of Adoption giving a filial Diſpoſition, and Aſſurance of a Fathers love doth much melt a filial frame of heart; but if love be ſhewed to a ſervile ſlaviſh ſpirit, it makes more haughty and lofty. Conſider therefore how thy Aſſurance worketh in thee, doth it put out all love to ſin and the world? Doth it kill inordinate affections to things below, and raiſe up thy heart to God, delighting and rejoycing in him? This is a comfortable demonſtration of good Aſſurance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Godly Aſſurance is potent and able to keep up the heart under all diſcouragements</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>and deſolations.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> in that ſad exigence, <hi>Encouraged himſelf in the Lord his God.</hi> This Certainty of our Propriety and Intereſt in God, is an Ark to the ſoul in the midſt of many waters; whereas take any carnal confident man, his heart becomes like a ſtone within him, when all carnal hopes fail. And this is a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſymptome, ſee in the midſt of theſe confuſions thou liveſt in, when Heaven and Earth ſeem to be mingled together, What makes thee rejoyce and to lift up thy head with gladneſs? Is it that Knowledge thou haſt of God to be thy God? Is it thoſe pledges and pawns in thy ſoul of his eternal love and goodneſs unto thee? This is ſomething. But alas, as the hypocrites joy, ſo his confidence will quickly periſh. It is not a Star fixed in the Orb made of quinteſſential matter, but a blazing Star compoſed of ſlimy materials, which will quickly conſume and vaniſh away. <hi>True Adamant</hi> (ſaith <hi>Origen Hom. 3. in Jer.) is tried by this, if it

can endure the hammer, if under the hammer above, and the anvil below, it continue more obdurate, then it is true metal: So it is with true Aſſurance, it abideth though billows and waves come upon it.

                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>We may finde a palpable Difference in the Companions or Concomitants of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">V. In the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants of it 1.</note>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>It's accompanied with holy fear and trembling,</hi> for as Gods Word doth not contradict it ſelf, when in ſome places it cals upon us to make our <hi>Calling ſure,</hi> and in other places to <hi>work out our Salvation with fear and trembling;</hi> So neither may theſe two Graces contradict one another, as they are in the ſubject. So then, they who are aſſured, though they rejoyce, yet they rejoyce with trembling. Thoſe who are aſſured <hi>they ſhall ſtand,</hi> yet <hi>take heed leſt they fall.</hi> As a man that looketh down from ſome place where Battlements are, though while he holds on them, he knoweth he cannot fall, yet when he looks to the ground, that is ſo deep below him, he cannot but fear he ſhould fall; ſo that at the ſame time he hath both an Aſſurance of not falling, and a fear of falling, though not from the ſame conſiderations. Thus it is with the people of God, whereas carnal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption excludeth all kinde of fear, obſtructeth all diligence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>A ſecond Companion is Humility and lowlineſſe of minde.</hi> For the greater mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies <note place="margin">2.</note> God beſtoweth upon his people, the lowlier they are in their own eyes, as the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> witneſſeth in her Song, and <hi>David</hi> in Gods kindneſs to him, whereas in carnal preſumption, the more confidence, the more pride in our ſelves, and deſpiſing of others. How might we prove that a Phariſee had not Aſſurance of Grace in him, but vain-confidence; by this, <hi>viz.</hi> that he deſpiſed other men as ſinners to him? And this may make us juſtly doubt, whether many that ſpeak of immediate Revelations and Aſſurances they have from Gods Spirit, be not in a proud deluſion, by contemning others as low, and not acquainted with the Spirit of God. For if there be ſuch a danger even in godly men, when lifted up to great priviledges, as in <hi>Paul, Wrapt up into the third Heavens,</hi> of becoming proud, that <hi>Paul</hi> is aſſaulted with <hi>buffetings of Satan,</hi> to keep him low, and he repeats it twice 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 7. Leſt I ſhould be lifted up above meaſure,</hi> in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the verſe; and again, <hi>Leſt I ſhould be lifted up,</hi> in the end of the verſe. <hi>Hierom</hi> compareth this Temptation of Satan exerciſing <hi>Paul</hi> in the midſt of his Revelations, to the <hi>Boy</hi> that was a <hi>Monitor,</hi> who cried aloud to him that rode in triumph, <hi>Mementote eſſe hominem, Remember thy ſelf to be a man.</hi> If, I ſay, there be ſuch danger even in godly men, when they have the real works of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, what cauſe is there of pride in corrupted men, who have only puff-paſte de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions of Satan? When therefore thy perſwaſion of Gods love to thee, raiſeth up lofty mountains in thy ſoul, thou lookeſt upon thy ſelf in heaven, while others grovel upon the ground, thou deemeſt thy ſelf to be as much above other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as an Angel is above a Worm; then fear this, coming from the devil tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming himſelf into an Angel of light.</p>

                  <p>THe differences between carnal Preſumption and godly Aſſurance have been at large declared. Let us in the next place conſider what are the fit engines to batter down thoſe ſtrong holds, That the carnal-confident man runneth into, what way may be taken to undeceive ſuch a man, and to put him in a way of Salvation.</p>
                  <p>And in the firſt place, <hi>This may be laid down as a moſt certain truth, That there</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">What way may be taken to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal confident.</note> 
                     <hi>are none more indiſpoſed for Chriſt, none have higher mountains and hils in the way, then the falſly perſwaded Chriſtian.</hi> Chriſt told the Phariſees, <hi>That the Publicans and Harlots got to heaven before them. Ille morbus vix eſt ſanabilis, qui ſanitatem imitatur,</hi> ſaith one, That diſeaſe is hardly curable that is like unto health: and the task muſt be great to remove ſuch an one from his ſtedfaſtneſs, becauſe two things are to be done; the former to make known his falſe righteouſneſs he is perſwaded of, and the latter the true righteouſneſs he is to be aſſured of. As the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> who was to teach one that was infected with falſe opinions, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a double fee, becauſe his work was double, <hi>dedocere,</hi> to unteach, and <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi> to teach. This was the great labour the Prophets of God were put upon; and Chriſt who had the tongue of the learned, preached many Parables to make the full hungry, and the rich empty in themſelves. What the Heretick is in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Doctrine, the ſame is a carnal preſumer in matter of practice and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Now as the former is ſeldom reduced, becauſe there is obſtinacy and contumacy in him againſt all admonitions; ſo is the latter ſcarce ever truly deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and humbled, becauſe of the ſelf-love that cleaveth to him.</p>
                  <p>But if ever any thing be able to overrule and conquer him, theſe remedies fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing are likely to do it.</p>

                     <hi>the hidden things of the heart, that thereby he may come to be made known to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> The Miniſtery of the Word is like the Sunne in the firmament, from whoſe light nothing is hidden. Thus the Prophets, the Apoſtles, they were lights. And what conviction might the Jews have had of all their ſelf-fulneſs and hypocriſies, if they had not ſhut their eyes againſt the light, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 4, 5. The weapons of the Miniſtry, though they be not <hi>carnal, yet are mighty to the pulling down of ſtrong-holds, and every thing that exalteth it ſelf,</hi> by this is meant all kinde of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. What the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> ſaid concerning Chriſt, that he diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:30767:29"/>
                     <hi>Whatſoever ſhe had done:</hi> So ſometimes may we ſay, Come and hear a Sermon that hath laid open all the vilenes and inward filthines, all the poverty and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs that is within me.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Remedy is, <hi>A particular opening and applying of the Law in the purity</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>and rigidity of it.</hi> Matth. 5. What an excellent courſe did our Saviour there take, to make his hearers afraid of themſelves, and to ſee more ſins in themſelves then ever they thought of! He makes the Law ſo ſpiritual, reaching ſo deeply into all the motions and luſts of the ſoul, that they muſt needs be as foul as Blackmoors in Gods eyes, while they did admire their own beauty. Thou bleſſeſt thy ſlf becauſe of the innocency in thy outward converſation and freedom from all groſs ſins, but no dunghill is fuller of Snakes and Worms then thy heart is of filthy luſts. Thus <hi>Rom. 7. Paul,</hi> as good as he was in his own eyes, when he looked into the glaſſe of Gods word, his holy Law, he found ſo many blots and blemiſhes in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he had no longer life or hope within him. Hence it is that men to keep themſelves from appearing ſo deformed as they are, limit the ſenſe of the Law, as if it were not ſo exact as it is, like the Elephant bemudding the water, that it may not ſee its own deformity.</p>
                  <p>The third Remedy is, <hi>To diſcover the fulneſſe and neceſſity of Chriſt.</hi> And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <note place="margin">3.</note> if Chriſt be ſo neceſſary, as the Scripture ſaith, and that in ſuch a way, as that his Righteouſneſs muſt be <hi>all in all;</hi> Then thereby is demonſtrated, that all which we have is nothing but ſinne and weakneſs. If Chriſt be commended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us under the titles of a Saviour, Phyſician, Redeemer, then certainly we are ſick, in bondage and utterly undone in our own ſelves. Why doſt thou then (O vain man) boaſt ſo in thy own ſelf! Why art thou ſo ſtrongly perſwaded of thy own ſufficiency? If it be ſo, What needs a Chriſt? Was not he incarnated? Did he not ſuffer in vain? If a Starre were able to give light to the world, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel all darkneſs, what need is there of a Sunne? If the ſtream hath enough to refreſh, what uſe is there of the Ocean? Wouldſt thou then come to be poor and miſerable in thy own eyes? Conſider in what glory, riches, fulneſs and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity the Scripture ſets Chriſt forth, and then thou maieſt quickly ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>A fourth Remedy are <hi>Outward and ſad afflictions accompanying the Word.</hi> For <note place="margin">4.</note> when God ſhall thus by his Word thunder in their ears and hearts; When he ſhall alſo outwardly ſcourge and afflict, then is a man many times taken off from his lofty imaginations. That as we deal with mad men, who have falſe conceits of their outward happineſs, throw them into Dungeons, uſe them hardly, and that is the way to bring them to the knowledge of themſelves; thus God when he would have a man reject all his carnal preſumptions, abhorre all high thoughts of himſelf, he hangs many clogs upon him, cauſing many thorns to run into his ſide. How much better were it for many men to be kept by God in darkneſs, and ſad plunges of their own ſpirit, then to be ſet alwaies upon the pinacle of the Temple (as it were.) Be therefore awakened out of thy ſecurity, fear leſt thou haſt lived thus many years in a meer dream of thy holineſs and intereſt in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>The examples of ſuch who have made great progreſſe (as might be</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>thought) in the wayes of Religion, and have had high thoughts of themſelves, whoſe ends notwithſtanding have been very dreadfull and terrible, is, or may be a ſpecial help to rouſe us out of falſe preſumptions.</hi> How ſhould that place be like a ſword in our bowels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. where ſome had illumination, yea and a ſavoury taſting in ſome degree of the goodneſs of God and his Word, yet had not <hi>things accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Salvation!</hi> So likewiſe the inſtance of the fooliſh Virgins, who were ſo bold and confident in their preparation for the Bridegroom, how wofully were they deluded! Now look over theſe examples, and conſider again and again, leſt their caſes and thine be alike. Think and tremble leſt the time be coming when thou ſhalt cry for oil, becauſe all thine is ſpent, and there is none to help thee.

Our Saviour by many Parables to this purpoſe would teach us how prone all are to be thus abuſed.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Let a preſumptuous man conſider how apt he is to miſtake in other things, and therefore fear leſt he do alſo in this of the greateſt concernment.</hi> Every man is <note place="margin">6.</note> full of blindeneſs, ſtupidity, ignorance, how often is he deceived even in natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and moral things? How often in truths ſupernatural? And is it any wonder then, if in the workings of his own heart, wherein he is commonly carried by ſelf-love? If a natural man doth not perceive many times natural things, how can he perceive the things of God? As our Saviour ſaid, If you underſtand not earthly things, how the things of Heaven? If a godly man, out of whoſe heart guile and hypocriſie is in a great meaſure removed, do yet cry out, <hi>Who can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his errors, Cleanſe me from ſecret ſins,</hi> How much more is this true of him who is wholly in the leaven of hypocriſie? If <hi>David</hi> hath much unknown pride and corruption in his heart, how much hath a Phariſee or an unregenerate man? It is a good ſpeech of <hi>Ameſius, Praeſumentes ſunt eo magis deſperati, quo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ſunt deſperantes;</hi> Preſumers are therefore in the more deſperate condition, by how much they are the leſſe deſpairing.</p>
                  <p>The next Queſtion ſhall be, <hi>What ought a man to do, who hath indeed the truth of Grace in him, but he knoweth it not?</hi> Though God hath wrought ſupernatural cures upon his ſoul, yet he doth not believe any ſuch mercy is done for him. And as when a man hath Aſſurance of the truth of grace in his ſoul, there is alſo a complication of the Aſſurance of Election, Juſtification, Perſeverance and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification; ſo when the ſoul is in darkneſs about the former, and hath no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge <note place="margin">How ſad a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition it is for a truly godly man to want the ſenſe of Gods favour.</note> of that, it is alſo involved in ignorance about the other things. Now how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever carnal men know not the ſadneſs of ſuch an eſtate, yet <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms make mention of the heavineſs of ſuch a condition, expreſſing it by all thoſe ſimilitudes which may make it to appear very horrid, He compareth it <hi>to broken bones,</hi> not one broken bone, <hi>but all his bones broken,</hi> What intolerable pain was that? Chriſt who wanted the light of Gods favour in his Agony, though no corporall bone was broken, yet was full of theſe broken bones.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Let him conſider whether ſome ſin, unreformed of, that he liveth in, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be ſinne, doth not eclipſe all his certainty. Davids</hi> Adultery drave away the <note place="margin">1. What a godly man ſhould do that mourns under the ſenſe of the want of Gods favour.</note> ſpirit of gladneſs and joy from his ſoul. Oh that is a curſed joy and confidence, which is not expelled by the committing of known groſſe ſins! How can there be Aſſurance and Peace, as if grace were in thee, when thou demonſtrateſt ſuch works of the fleſh and Satan in thee? Is it any wonder then to ſee men who take upon them the profeſſion of Religion, and yet live looſly, tumbling now and then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to foul ſins, if they have often an hell upon their conſciences, and frequent terrors upon their ſoul? As when vapours are gathered together in the bowels of the earth, it cannot but make an Earthquake; ſo ſinne gathered together in the heart, will one time or other make an heartquake. That place <hi>Epheſ. 4. Grieve not the Spirit of God,</hi> ſuppoſeth ſin doth grieve him, and how juſt is it then that Gods Spirit ſhould grieve us?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Suppoſe no grievous ſin fallen into make ſuch a great gulf between him and Aſſurance, that he can neither come to that, or that to him, yet negligent, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>careleſſe uſe of the means of grace, will much weaken a mans Certainty.</hi> You heard that place, <hi>Give all diligence to make your Calling ſure;</hi> So that without conſtant Diligence this Aſſurance cannot be obtained; for although ſincere and zealous endeavours after godlineſſe be not the cauſe, yet they are the ſign and teſtimony of Gods love; and ſo without theſe there cannot be any comfort at all.

When the Apoſtle exhorted to Prayer, That we ſhould make our requeſts known, he addeth, <hi>And the peace of God ſhall rule in your hearts.</hi> It is therefore an unworthy thing to ſpeak of doubting, and complain of the loſſe of Gods favour, and that thou haſt no Aſſurance, when all thy

Duties and Performances are careleſs and withered.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>If yet thou haſt no Aſſurance, then know that it is a free and arbitrary</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>Priviledge, which God beſtoweth when and where he liſteth.</hi> We did briefly, and ſhall more at large ſhew, that it is the Spirit of Adoption, which doth work that filial affection, and inable to <hi>cry Abba Father.</hi> It is the Spirit of God that doth ſeal unto us; ſo that Aſſurance doth not flow from the workings of grace in us by a natural and neceſſary conſequence, but by the immediate diſpenſation of Gods love unto us. Hence 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. God is called, <hi>The God of all conſolation who comforteth us;</hi> For God doth not as a Chriſtian friend or Miniſter may do to one tempted about ſin, outwardly propound comfort, and give him arguments of conſolation, but cannot inwardly turn and change his heart; but God he doth ſo outwardly command his people to be aſſured and comforted, that he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly faſhion and form their hearts to receive it. That ſame power of God in converting grace, which is called by the Father <hi>vorticordium,</hi> is ſeen alſo in this of conſolation. God therefore would by this teach us, That Aſſurance is not a flower that will grow of it ſelf in the garden of our hearts.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Is there the truth of Grace in thee, and thou art not aware of it? Is it</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>with thee, as with Hagar, who had a fountain of water by her, and ſhe did not ſee it? yet ſtill go on in the conſtant exerciſe of thy graces.</hi> Thou art bound to love God, truſt in him, perform all Duties, though thy heart ſhould never feel Gods love to thee; for although the Aſſurance of Gods favour be like coals of fire poured upon the ſoul to melt it, yet we ſtand obliged to the ſpiritual exerciſe of holy Duties, though God ſhould not give us this encouragement thereunto, <hi>To him that overcometh, I will give the white ſtone, and the hidden Manna.</hi> This priviledge of Aſſurance is given to thoſe who have a long time been acquainted with God, much exerciſed in his wayes, and enduring much for him. Not but that God doth to new Converts alſo many times diſcover the love of his Eſpouſals to them, becauſe they are moſt tender and need it, being much oppreſſed with ſinne. As <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerveth it a ſpecial inſtinct of nature, whereby Parents are moſt tender of the youngeſt childe, becauſe that can leaſt take care for it ſelfe.</p>
                  <p>The third Queſtion, <hi>Why doth God when he hath wrought Grace in us, not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Why God doth not give Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance preſently to thoſe that have true grace wrought in them.</note> 
                     <hi>enable us to believe, and ſee it in our ſouls? David,</hi> though the Prophet told him his <hi>ſinne was taken away,</hi> yet in that <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. how importunately and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly doth he pray for pardon and joy. Which implieth, that though God cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this outwardly to be declared to him, yet he did not by his almighty power effectually perſwade him of it, and the Queſtion ſeemeth the greater, becauſe this Aſſurance would be wings and legs in a mans ſervice to God. It would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame him more to promote Gods glory: And beſides, God loſeth much of his glory and honour; for how can the ſoul rejoyce to give God the praiſe for that mercy which he knoweth not that he hath received? ſo that not to know our pardon, and not to have it, are all one, as to the matter of thankfulneſs: yet for all theſe reaſons, how frequently doth God keep his own people in darkneſs? How many times are they ready (with <hi>Zion)</hi> to ſay, <hi>God hath forſaken us!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But for all this there are divers good reaſons, why God, though he hath put grace in our ſouls, may yet not publiſh it in our conſciences.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That hereby we may taſte and ſee how bitter ſinne is.</hi> The longer that guilt <note place="margin">1.</note> with the conſequents of it is upon our ſoul, the greater cauſe have we to bewail it and abominate it. If grace or the Aſſurance of it were in our power to have it when and as ſoon as we would, how ſleighty and perfunctory would our thoughts be about ſinne? <hi>Davids</hi> length of time under the guilt of murder and adultery, wrought in him greater hatred and diſlike of thoſe ſins. And howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it may ſeem to be a ſervile low ſpirit to awe ſinne, becauſe of the bitterneſs of it, and not only becauſe of love of God, and delight in him; yet no better <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

under thoſe black deſertions, though thou knoweſt not how it is with thee, yet Gods end is good, to keep thee low and weary of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Hereby God would keep us low and humble in our ſelves.</hi> We many times upon the diſcoveries of Gods works on our hearts are apt to grow high and <note place="margin">2.</note> contemn others; we are apt to think God hath raiſed us up above others, that we know and feel more of God then other men do. Now that all ſuch worms of pride may be killed in us, God hides his face from us, and thereby we ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but ſin and weakneſſes in us; all our whole life appeareth to us nothing, but as <hi>Anſelms</hi> did to him, <hi>Aut peccatum, aut ſterilitas,</hi> either ſin or barrenneſs. When thy heart ſeeth nothing but ſinne round about thee, then thou canſt lie before the throne of God who is rich in grace, like <hi>Lazarus</hi> before the rich mans gate full of ſores; and as <hi>Chryſologus</hi> ſaid of him, that he had <hi>Tot clamantia ora, quot vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nera,</hi> as many mouths crying for help, as he had ſores, ſo wilt thou have as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mouths begging for pardon, as thou haſt ſins and infirmities.

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>God may therefore keep Aſſurance from our knowledge, that ſo when we have it, we may the more eſteem it, and the more prize it, taking the greater heed how</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>we loſe it.</hi> We ſee the Church in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> when ſhe had deſpiſed her Spou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes love, how earneſt ſhe was to get it again, but it coſt her much ere ſhe could have it. <hi>Sol niſi cum deficit ſpectatorem non habet,</hi> ſaid <hi>Seneca,</hi> No body admires the Sun unleſſe when eclipſed, ſo neither do any highly eſteem the favour and love of God, unleſſe when in the loſſe of it. As it is in temporal mercies, ſo in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, they are prized <hi>Carendo magis, quam habendo,</hi> by the wanting of them, more then the having of them: Doſt thou therefore pray, and again pray for Aſſurance, yet can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t not obtain it? then think this delay may be to encreaſe my appetite the more after it, the more to bleſſe God when my ſoul ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>God doth it that thou mayeſt demonſtrate thy obedience unto him, and give the greater honour to him.</hi> For to relie upon God by faith, when thou haſt <note place="margin">4.</note> no ſenſible teſtimonies of his love to thee, is the pureſt and meereſt act of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that can be. Such faith of adherence did Chriſt put forth in his agonies. A man may deſire Aſſurance, as it breeds peace and eaſe to his ſoul, but to depend upon God in ſpiritual deſertions, is wholly to give all to God and nothing to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; ſuch a faith is a kinde of a ſpiritual Martyrdom. The way of Aſſurance brings more comfort to thy ſelf, but the way of believing gives more glory to God. When <hi>Abraham</hi> did not <hi>ſtagger in his Faith,</hi> though <hi>Sarahs</hi> womb was a <hi>dead womb,</hi> this was giving glory to God No leſſe is thy action, when thou overlookeſt all thy own ſenſe, feeling and ſad temptations, truſting in God for acceptance. To walk by Aſſurance is a kinde of walking by ſenſe, and it ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us children, if we cannot be quiet unleſſe in the mothers boſom.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>God withholdeth the ſenſe of pardon, that thou mayeſt be an experienced Chriſtian able to comfort others in their diſtreſſe.</hi> This is true of Chriſt himſelf, that <note place="margin">5.</note> he was tempted about the wrath of God, that ſo he might have a ſympathy and fellow-feeling with thoſe who are in the like manner exerciſed. <hi>Paul</hi> makes this end of Gods comforts in his tribulations, that they might comfort others in the like caſe. He that is not tempted about the pardon of ſin, wonders at thoſe who are ſo afflicted, and therefore is altogether unskilful to apply fit remedies. We ſee carnal and natural people judge ſuch mad and diſtracted, they bid them go to merry company, feaſt and recreate themſelves, thinking this carnal plaiſter will heal their ſpiritual ſore. <hi>Job</hi> 33. 23. <hi>Elihu</hi> deſcribing the condition of a man
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:30767:31"/>
chaſtened for ſin, ſo that he utterly refuſeth all comforts, makes it a great mercy to have a meſſenger that can ſhew to ſuch a man his uprightneſs. This meſſenger he cals <hi>one of a thouſand:</hi> make therefore this good uſe of ſuch temptations, God hereby would raiſe me up to be a <hi>Joſeph</hi> to my brethren in their need.</p>
                  <p>Let the Uſe be to raze up the foundations of all carnal preſumers. This is a <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> common ſin and damneth thouſands, inſomuch that preſumption is made a more grievous ſin then deſpair, for in deſpair a man is weary of himſelf, abhorreth his own eſtate, would if he could admit better counſel; but a preſumer pleaſeth himſelf, and ſo will not hearken to any good admonitions; Oh how ſadly art thou deluded, how fruſtrated will thy expectations be, when thou ſhalt ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but hell and confuſion in ſtead of all that joy and comfort thou didſt promiſe to thy own ſelf! The fooliſh Virgins ſaw their undone condition, when it was too late to help themſelves: do thou fear leaſt thou be plunged into ſuch horrid extremities. The nearer the haven thou art, if thou ſuffer ſhipwrack, the more lamentable it is. The Church made this an aggravation of miſery, <hi>We looked for peace, but behold trouble.</hi>

                  <p>WE come now to the ſecond general part of the ſecond Doctrine, which is, <hi>That there are ſuch Characters and Signs of Grace, whereby a man may know whether he be in the ſtate of Grace or no.</hi> It is a point worth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, and I know not any thing more neceſſary at this time, ſeeing there are many who wholly cry down Miniſters that preach ſigns of Grace, and diſcourage Chriſtians that uſe ſuch a method for a trial. It is alſo neceſſary, becauſe there is much prudence required in the Miniſter, while he preaches about ſigns; and it is an art of arts for a Chriſtian, to manage that way, ſo as not to ſplit himſelf upon ſome rock or other. Therefore that this whole Doctrine may be more exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcovered, conſider theſe introductory particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That by the inherent Grace of Sanctification in us, we come to have a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Introductory Propoſitions, and diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance. 1. By inherent grace we come to have a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> 
                     <hi>being.</hi> So that as natural things have a natural being by that natural form which is in them: Thus alſo the godly have a ſpiritual and ſupernatural by that infuſed principle of an holy life in them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. we are hereby ſaid to be <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the divine nature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. Such a regenerated man is called a <hi>new creature,</hi> and indeed the very word of regeneration, or new birth, ſuppoſeth a new being not eſſentially, but in reſpect of thoſe gracious habits and qualities which the Spirit of God worketh in him; This alſo is called the <hi>inward man,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16. <hi>Nerimbergius</hi> the Jeſuite thinketh <hi>Paul</hi> fetcheth that diſtinction of an inward and outward man from <hi>Plato,</hi> who maketh ſuch a difference; This work of Grace is that image of God in us, whereby we reſemble him, ſo that godlineſs is not a notion, a meer fiction, but a ſupernatural, power full reality, whereby a man hath a new denomination, of ungodly he is become godly, even
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:30767:32"/>
as in natural things by a phyſical motion there is a reall tranſmutation, as of cold to become hot; or in moral things, as of a fool to become wiſe. Let not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any dream of holineſs in themſelves, unleſſe there be ſuch a powerfull alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from the ſtate of ſinne. Hence it is compared to the Reſurrection, and indeed Regeneration makes no leſſe glorious change of the ſoul, then that doth of the body, as by the latter <hi>Our vile bodies are made like his glorious body;</hi> ſo our vile and corrupted ſouls are become like his gracious and holy ſoul. <hi>Tully</hi> ſaid, in regard of our ſouls, which he thought a divine ſpark from the glorious Eſſence of God, <hi>Scito te eſſe Deum,</hi> Know thy ſelf to be God: This was upon a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous foundation; but we may truly ſay, becauſe of thoſe ſupernatural principles, even the image of God within thee, what God once did ironically, <hi>Behold, man is become like one of us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Inherent Grace being thus in us as a ſupernatural permanent principle</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Inherent grace hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing internal and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of it, and ſomething that is flowing from it.</note> 
                     <hi>of holy actions, it hath therefore as all other things have, ſomething that is internal and conſtitutive of it, and ſomething that is conſecutive or flowing from it.</hi> That which is conſtitutive of godlineſs, is the nature of the habits of graces with all their particular differences, as <hi>animal rationale</hi> is that which intrinſecally makes a man. 2. There are properties which do flow and iſſue from theſe, and theſe are properly the marks and ſigns, whereby we come to know that grace in us: for as in Philoſophy, <hi>Formae nos latent,</hi> we do not know the forms or internal conſtitutive differences of things, <hi>Vitrum lambimus, pultem non attingimus,</hi> as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaid, only we come to know the nature of things by their properties and effects; hence we have few definitions, but many deſcriptions of things from their properties and effects, all our knowledge being for the moſt part <hi>a poſterio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> rather then <hi>a priori,</hi> as a man that cannot ſee the Sun it ſelf, becauſe of it's glorious luſtre, can behold it in a baſon of water. Hence ſome have denied that we have a demonſtrative knowledge of things, which is from the cauſes to the effects. To apply this to our purpoſe, the inward principles and immediate na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of grace, is not evidenced unto us, but by the effects and proper motions, even as in a natural life there is no diſcerning of it, but by the motions of life; hence by inherent grace we are ſaid to live, <hi>Gal. 2. 19, 20. Rom.</hi> 1. 17. So that as natural motions diſcern natural life, thus do ſupernatural a ſupernatural life; with this difference, that to this latter there is required alſo a peculiar illumination of Gods Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>There are differences about the ſigns of Grace, even as Grace it ſelf is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed.</hi> The Scripture cals thoſe ſeveral gifts of extraordinary Office, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſhip, <note place="margin">3. There are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences about the ſigns of grace. 1. Gift of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Graces;</hi> ſo that all who have an immediate call from God to any Duty, they have a grace from God; now howſoever all extraordinary Prophets have not wrought miracles to confirm their Doctrine, as <hi>John</hi> wrought no miracles, yet many times they were furniſhed with ſuch a power; hence Chriſt and his Apoſtles by vertue derived from him, wrought divers miracles, inſomuch as <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. this is made an argument of the preſence of Gods Spirit among them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>There are common Graces of Gods Spirit, and to this there are common effects</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Common gracesevidence an outward Call.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſigns ſufficient,</hi> ſuch are, an hiſtorical belief, a viſible profeſſion, an outward acceptation of Chriſt and his Laws, when there may be no inward change of the heart at all: for as God doth call many by an outward call, whom he doth not inwardly call; ſo many do outwardly accept of, and proſeſſe the faith of Chriſt, which do it not inwardly; and by this means they have a viſible holineſs as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the unconverted world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. There is holineſs and believing op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to Heatheniſm and Paganiſm; hence <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. that Apoſtate who never had true ſanctifying grace, is yet ſaid to be <hi>ſanctified by the bloud of Chriſt.</hi> Hence alſo becauſe of the outward Sacraments men are ſaid to be <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> and to have <hi>put on Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and upon this ground the Apoſtle writeth to the Churches as a company of Saints, regarding the term from which they are called, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:30767:32"/>
world, and the term to which, <hi>viz. Communion and fellowſhip with Chriſt.</hi> Now the notes and marks of this common grace are eaſie and plain, and it may fall out that a viſible number of people may have theſe, ſo that they are to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a viſible Church, and the Ordinances not denied to them, yet be without thoſe ſigns that do indeed accompany Salvation. But we intend not to ſpeak of ſuch notes and characters that are enough to make one a viſible member of the Church, and ſo to qualifie us that we may not have the Ordinances denied us, in which ſenſe the Apoſtle, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. of this preſent 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter praieth to God, that the <hi>Corinthians may do no evil,</hi> which is not meant of evil abſolutely, but reſtrictedly, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch an evil for which the Apoſtle ſhould puniſh with Church-cenſures, as the context doth abundantly witneſs. It is true, the greateſt ſort of Chriſtians ſatisfie themſelves with common characters and ſigns, ſuch as Baptiſm, external profeſſion, and outward abſtinence from ſin; hencefrom arguing for their Sanctification and Acceptation with God: But more of this hereafter. As we muſt not make the ſigns of grace higher then the Scripture makes them, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought we to draw them down lower.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Scripture ſpeaks of ſuch marks of grace, whereby others may know that we belong to God, and of ſuch as we may in our own hearts be evidenced thereof.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. Marks where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by others may know we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</note> Of the firſt ſee <hi>Joh. 13. 35. By this ſhall all men know ye are my Diſciples, if ye love one another;</hi> He doth not ſay, If ye work miracles, if ye raiſe up the dead, but if ye love one another; now what a kinde of love this ought to be, the Scripture in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces deſcribeth, <hi>viz.</hi> not a love in word, but in deed and in truth; now the knowledg we have of other mens graces is but charitative and conjectural; The Apoſtle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth it by a ſuppoſing and a perſwaſion that faith is truly in ſuch; Though men may give clear and undoubted ſigns of their wickedneſs and naughtineſs, yet they cannot of their godlineſs and piety; becauſe there is not any thing in Religion which may be expreſſed to another, which may not flow from an hypocritical heart, as well as a ſound; yet the Scripture 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. ſpeaks of the end of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, <hi>That the approved may be made manifeſt,</hi> viz. <hi>to others:</hi> So 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 3. the <note place="margin">Signs whereby we our ſelves may know we are of God.</note> 
                     <hi>Corinthians</hi> are ſaid to be manifeſtly declared <hi>To be the Epiſtle of Chriſt;</hi> but this in reſpect only of a moral certainty, ſo farre as men can perceive, otherwiſe it is made Gods prerogative to know who are his: Therefore the Apoſtle cals the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of a man, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>The hidden things of the heart.</hi> In the ſecond place, The Scripture makes ſuch ſigns, whereby we may know in our ſelves that we are of God, and his Spirit dwelleth in us, 1 <hi>John 2. 3. Hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his commandments;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> is very frequent in deſcribing grace by way of ſigns, in his Epiſtles, as is more largely to be ſhewed; now this knowledge and evidence which the godly have in themſelves of their own grace, is farre more clear and certain, then what they have of anothers; Inſomuch that it is made by ſome to be a certainty of faith, or at leaſt the ſenſe and experiment of faith, howſoever ſuch a knowledge it is that it cannot deceive us, or be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Thoſe ſigns which the Scripture gives of grace are proper and peculiar to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5. Signs of grace proper to the godly only.</note> 
                     <hi>the godly man only.</hi> So that whoſoever hath theſe hath grace, and he that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them muſt alſo be without grace. Thus <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. the good ground, which is alſo the good and honeſt heart, is deſcribed by ſuch a temper and conſtitution, that it differs ſpecifically from thoſe works which are upon hypocrites: So that howſoever that be true of <hi>Calvin,</hi> Reprobates <hi>(ſimili firmè ſenſu afficiuntur ac electi)</hi> are affected almoſt in like manner with the elect, yet it is but almoſt, and the difference between them is not gradual, but ſpecifically, as is more largely to be ſhewed againſt <hi>Antinomians</hi> on the one ſide, and <hi>Arminians</hi> on the other; ſo that the ſorrow, the faith which the godly have differ from that <hi>tanquam,</hi> as it were, ſorrow and faith, which the hypocrites have, as the Philoſophers ſay, The matter of the heavenly bodies, which they make quinteſſential, diſtereth from
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:30767:33"/>
that of the ſublunary; ſo that no extenſion of parts, intenſion of degrees, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of time, could ever make temporary faith ſaving faith, for <hi>Species non fit ex ſpecie,</hi> as the maxim in Philoſophy is, One diſtinct kinde is not compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of another, but this matter is of larger debate.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>The Scripture deſcribing the Marks of a godly man makes them</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6. Poſitive marks ſignifie more evidently then the negative.</note> 
                     <hi>of different ſorts, ſome Negative, ſome Poſitive, and the Poſitive do ſignifie more evidently then the Negative.</hi> James 1. 27. <hi>Pure Religion</hi> is deſcribed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Poſitives, and by one Negative: to be <hi>unſpotted from the world.</hi> Pſalm. 15. is a profeſſed deſcription of a godly man, wherein are ſix Poſitives and ſix Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives; Now it is true, neither Negatives or Poſitives, as they are outwardly and viſibly expreſſed, can be a ſure teſtimony of godlineſs; for a man may doe that which is good, and abſtain from that which is evil upon ſeverall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt grounds, every one of which is a dead Flie in a box of Ointment. In the firſt Pſalm, a godly man is deſcribed by his Negatives; firſt, <hi>That he doth not ſit in the counſell of the wicked, nor walketh with the ungodly,</hi> onely Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative ſignes doe not come up to ſo full a manifeſtation of grace, as Poſitive; and the reaſon is, becauſe grace lieth moſt in the things we ought to doe, and good is more good then evil is evil, and therefore our love to the one is more to be exerciſed then our hatred of the other; Therefore it is a deceitfull and vain way, to argue our grace from Negatives onely, as the Phariſee did, <hi>I am no extortioner, no adulterer.</hi> For God at the day of Judgement will proceed in this form, according to the good things we have done; yet the generality of people have no other claim or plea, but what is upon Negatives, they are no ſuch wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked or prophane perſons; But godlineſs doth not denote a meer abſence of evil, but a Poſitive concurrence of good.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>The Properties and Effects of Grace, may be conſidered Abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">7. The properties and effects of grace conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abſolutely and relatively.</note> 
                     <hi>as they are Properties, or Relatively, as they are Signs.</hi> Now the Scripture ſpeaks of theſe both wayes, <hi>Gal. 6. 25. He that is Chriſts, hath mortified the fleſh with the affections and luſts thereof.</hi> So 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 17. He that is in Chriſt is a new creature; Old things are paſt away, and all things are become new.</hi> Thus alſo <hi>Rom. 8. 1. Thoſe that are in Christ Jeſus</hi> are ſaid <hi>to walk after the ſpirit, not after the fleſh.</hi> All theſe Texts and the like, are only indicative, and deſcriptive of thoſe ſubjects who are godly in their Properties; but <hi>John</hi> in his Epiſtles doth ſpeak of theſe as they are ſignes, whereby we know we are of God; as more largely is to be ſhewed. There is a great difference between theſe two, for a Chriſtian may have all the adjuncts and fruit of grace, and yet they not be ſignes to him, for he may be ignorant that they are in him, yea he may be ſtrongly perſwaded through temptation that he hath them not; and how often are the people of God in this ſad darkneſſe, concluding themſelves hypocrites, <hi>A barren wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, unſavoury ſalt,</hi> when yet they are the pleaſant Garden of Chriſt! Now if theſe Effects were in them by way of ſignes, it is impoſſible but they ſhould conclude themſelves in a ſtate of grace and peace: <hi>So that to be a ſigne is a Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Being, by which we are brought into remembrance of ſomething elſe.</hi> Thus the Sacraments are ſignes. Thus <hi>Rahabs</hi> red thred was a ſigne to remember the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for her preſervation. Then are the Effects of Grace by way of Marks and Signes, when in the beholding of them, we ſee the cauſes that wrought them, we ſee Election, Juſtification, Adoption and Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration from whence theſe flow, concluding thus, All theſe great and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things could not be in my ſoul, were not Chriſt and his Spirit there; this rich and glorious furniture could not be in my ſoul, were not the King of Glory there. The flowers of this garden would not ſmell ſo ſweetly, did not the winde blow upon them.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, <hi>Signs (as to our purpoſe) may be divided into two ranks. Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">8.</note> which by a neceſſary conſequence ſignifie; Thus ſmoke doth ſignifie there
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:30767:33"/>
is a fire; or <hi>Voluntary</hi> by will and appointment, ſuch as the Sacraments are; for howſoever there be ſome natural Analogy and fitneſſe in the Sacraments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſignes, and the things ſignified, yet the determinate appointing of ſuch a ſignification, is meerly by the appointment of God; now concerning the Properties and Effects of Grace, as they are ſignes, we cannot ſay, they are meerly Natural, nor meerly Voluntary, but of a mixt Nature; They are not meerly Naturall, becauſe then whoſoever hath grace working in him, would perceive and know he hath ſo, but experience confuteth that; therefore the Spirit of God witneſſing and aſſuring is required, beſides the preſence of grace in us. It is true, that ſaying of <hi>Auguſtines</hi> is much celebrated and uſed againſt Popiſh doubting, <hi>Quiſquis credit, ſentit ſe habere fidem in corde, Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doth believe, perceiveth in himſelf that he doth believe.</hi> Hence it is that our Divines ſay, <hi>As he that hath fire in his boſom feeleth fire is there; He that taſteth of a ſweet object, perceiveth the ſweetneſſe of it, and he that is awake, knoweth he is awake; ſo he that hath the operations of Gods Spirit, knoweth that theſe are wrought by God in him, and that he is not deceived.</hi> But howſoever theſe are true in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the genuine and proper work of that ſupernatural life in us, yet there may be ſeveral impediments from <hi>within</hi> through ſinne, eſpecially unbelief inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, or obſtructions <hi>without,</hi> by Gods deſertion and forſaking of us, that we cannot perceive the good things God hath done for us, <hi>Thus they are not Signes in a meer Natural way.</hi> Nor yet can we ſay they are meerly Voluntary ſignes, for the Effects of grace are the proper and genuine fruit of grace; and whereſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Sanctification is, there is ſuppoſed Juſtification inſeparably. They are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore evidences of our intereſt in Chriſt, yet ſo as they manifeſt this, <hi>Onely by the light of the Spirit;</hi> as ſome Philoſophers ſay of the Starres, that they have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate light of their own, but yet they are not conſpicuous and viſible without the light of the Sunne. The gracious fruit of thoſe ſupernaturall principles in us, have an aptitude and fitneſſe to make us know that we are in Chriſt, but they cannot actually remove all darkneſſe without the Spirit of God, even as the light of the Sunne onely, not that of the Starres, can diſpell the darkneſſe of the night.</p>
                  <p>Hence in the ninth place, <hi>We muſt take heed that we do not ſo gaze upon our ſelves</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">9.</note> 
                     <hi>to finde graces in our own hearts, as thereby we forget thoſe Acts of Faith, whereby we cloſe with Chriſt immediately, and rely upon him onely for our Juſtification.</hi> The fear of this hath made ſome cry down totally the uſe of ſignes, to evidence our Juſtification. And the truth is, it cannot be denied but many of the children of God, while they are ſtudying and examining, Whether grace be in their ſouls, that upon the diſcovery thereof, they may have comfortable perſwaſions of their Juſtification, are very much neglective of thoſe choiſe and principall Acts of Faith, whereby we have an acquieſcency or recumbency up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt for our Acceptation with God. This is as if old <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the Chariot <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſent, whereby he knew that he was alive, that he ſhould not deſire to ſee <hi>Joſeph</hi> himſelf. Thus while thou art ſo full of joy, to perceive grace in thee, thou forgetteſt to joy in Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who is more excellent then all thy graces: But of this more after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, <hi>The Scripture attributeth Bleſſedneſſe and Salvation to ſeveral Signs</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">10.</note> 
                     <hi>thereof.</hi> Sometimes <hi>Fear of God</hi> is a ſigne, ſometimes <hi>Poverty of Spirit,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Hungring and thirſting after Righteouſneſſe,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Repentance,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Love,</hi> and ſometimes <hi>Patience:</hi> So that if a godly man can finde any one of theſe in himſelf, he may conclude of his Salvation and Juſtification, though he cannot ſee all thoſe in him; and many times the people of God perceive one ſign in them, when they cannot another. So that it is not here in the ſignes of our Juſtification, as the Learned ſpeak about the marks and ſignes of <hi>Christ</hi> and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:30767:34"/>
                     <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> it may fall out that ſome other have ſome of the ſigns which did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> but none could have them all, but he that was truly Chriſt indeed: So there are many deſcriptions of Antichriſt, and it may fall out that ſome other beſides him may have ſome of thoſe marks, but none have them all cumulatively and collectively, but the true Antichriſt. It is not ſo with the marks of grace, for if a man upon good grounds can be perſwaded but of one, he may undoubtedly conclude he hath all the reſt, though he doe not yet feel them in himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, <hi>The Signes and Marks which the Scripture makes of true grace, are</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">11.</note> 
                     <hi>to be inſiſted upon or uſed, although it may fall out that Hypocrites may be ſtrongly confident they have them, when indeed they have them not.</hi> It is therefore no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt ſignes of grace, becauſe an hypocrite is confident he hath them, and yet is deceived. The wiſe Virgins who had prepared oyl, knew their Bride-groom, and went out to meet him; although the fooliſh who wanted oyl, went out at firſt to meet the Bridegroom as confidently as the wiſe; doe not therefore deſpair of diſcerning the true marks of grace in thy ſelf, becauſe many have falſly perſwaded themſelves thereof. Many a dreamer hath pleaſed himſelf that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed ſuch riches or delicacies in his dream; yet that hindreth not, but that the man awake knoweth when he hath riches, and is not deceived. An hypocrite then, he may be bold, he is ſecure of Gods favour, he dieth with confidence, calling God his God, and Chriſt his Chriſt, it cannot be denied; but this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth not, that the true believer knoweth he is in the right, and not deceived. As in matter of Religion, the <hi>Turk</hi> is confident of his, the <hi>Jew</hi> of his, the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt</hi> as he, yet it followeth not that the Proteſtant therefore may not confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know, he is in the truth, and all other deceived.</p>
                  <p>Twelfthly, <hi>Signes or Notes of any thing muſt be according to the Nature of that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">12.</note> 
                     <hi>which they notifie:</hi> So that if the Eſſence be imperfect, then the marks thereof have alſo imperfection. This is a rule of grand comfort in practice, for the godly they look for perfect ſignes of grace in themſelves, and if they finde hypocriſie, carnal ends, lukewarmneſſe, or any ſuch diſtempers, they begin to doubt of their whole eſtate, but they muſt conſider, that as their graces themſelves are not perfect; ſo neither can the ſignes thereof be perfect. Hence it is, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though we grant that the godly may, as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> did, take comfort from the truth of grace in themſelves, yet it was not from it as a cauſe, or merit of their Juſtification, for even at the ſame time they did alſo eſpie much imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in themſelves.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>WE have laid down ſeveral Propoſitions tending to the clearer Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this truth about Signs or Marks of Grace. I now come to ſhew <hi>The Lawfulneſſe, yea the Duty both of Ministers and People to proceed by this method.</hi> For although my proper work is onely to ſpeak of the fruits of Grace, as they evidence a principle of Sanctification within, yet I ſhall in this graſp alſo that other Queſtion <hi>Of evidencing our Juſtification by inherent gracious</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Inherent gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations within us evidence our Juſtification.</note> 
                     <hi>Qualifications within us,</hi> this latter being expreſly written and preached againſt; ſo that by this means godly Chriſtians are plunged into ſeveral intanglements of conſcience, and know not how to come out. I ſhall therefore (God aſſiſting) bring Arguments to confirm us in this Duty: onely let us firſt underſtand, What the true practical Caſe and Queſtion is. And firſt the Queſtion is not, Whether a <note place="margin">The Queſtion ſtated.</note> Chriſtian in his firſt act of Faith, whereby he cloſeth with Chriſt, applieth him, and is engraffed in him, ought to ſee inherent Qualifications in him, by way of Signs and Evidences? for this is not poſſible: we muſt firſt by faith be implanted in Chriſt, before there can be any fruits demonſtrating this our inſition in him. The Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> 1 John 2. 5. maketh the obſervation of Gods Commandments a ſign that we are in Chriſt, therefore we are in Chriſt before by faith; and thus in all the Promiſes, where a Chriſtian loaden with ſin is invited to Chriſt, there is not required a Knowledge or Certainty of what condition he is in, Whether his graces be true or no, but only out of the ſenſe and feeling of his own unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs to apprehend Chriſt It is therefore a falſhood to preach thus, Thou maieſt not relie upon Chriſt for Juſtification, till thou haſt certainty and evidence in thy heart, whether grace be truly in thee or no? for the Scripture makes them <hi>bleſſed that hunger and thirst, that mourn,</hi> and cals thoſe that <hi>are burdened, and they ſhall have eaſe,</hi> although they may not have certainty of the work of grace at that time. This therefore is diligently to be attended unto, becauſe it cannot be denied but at this Rocke many a tender Chriſtian ſplits himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Nor ſecondly is the Queſtion, <hi>Whether a godly man in ſad temptations, having no light at all, ſhould then make ſearch for the motions and workings of grace in his ſoul?</hi> for that would breed further fears and uncertainties. The ſoul in temptations being like the muddied water, where nothing can be clearly repreſented, and as in the night the imagination is prone to repreſent nothing but objects of fear and terrors; ſo is the heart apt to do in thoſe deſolations: Hence <hi>David</hi> in ſuch exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:30767:35"/>
cals upon his ſoul <hi>to truſt in God,</hi> and to <hi>wait on him as the only remedy.</hi> And indeed in ſuch caſes, the proper duty of a godly man is to throw himſelf boldly upon the promiſe, and as <hi>Peter</hi> ventured to go upon the waters, when Chriſt called him; ſo becauſe of the Promiſe and gracious invitations, to go unto God, and relie upon him, in which ſenſe <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, <hi>Though he kill me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Doubt is not, <hi>Whether a godly man ſhould look for perfect Signs, ſuch as will fully riſe up to the obligation and perfection of the Law?</hi> for it is plain ſuch Signs can never be found. Therefore it is but an odious miſtake, when an <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Criſpe</hi> in his Sermon of inherent Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications.</note> argueth againſt univerſal Obedience as a ſign, becauſe no man can perform ſuch, or if it ſhould be limited to purpoſe of heart, yet none hath ſuch a conſtant purpoſe, becauſe of many corrupt ſuggeſtions and concuſſions within by luſts; for none do urge ſuch Signs, and therefore the leaſt grace diſcovered in the ſoul, that is ſincere and upright, though it be not grace to ſatisfie the deſire of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, yet it ought to be a ſign ſure enough to confirm his judgement of his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The caſe is not, <hi>Whether inherent Qualifications of grace, be eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of themſelves without the luſtre of Gods Spirit?</hi> For all ſay, this certainty ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth efficiently from the Spirit of God; Therefore <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. ſealing is attributed to the Spirit of God; ſo that we muſt not oppoſe a godly life, or graces to the Spirit of God, but conjoyn them together; even as in the certainty we have about the Scripture, we do not oppoſe thoſe <hi>Argumenta inſita,</hi> imbred arguments that prove the Divinity of the Scripture, ſuch as the ſtyle, majeſty, purity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to the Spirit of God: but we ſay, Gods Spirit doth perſwade in, and by thoſe Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; ſo it is here, Gods Spirit doth ſeal unto us our intereſt in Chriſt by thoſe graces which are wrought in us.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The ſcruple is not, <hi>Whether theſe works of Gods Spirit in us, be to be reſted on as cauſes or merits of our Justification?</hi> This is ſuch Phariſaical Popery as is juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be deteſted, we ſay not that a Chriſtian finding ſuch graces in him, ſhould build the comfort of his Juſtification upon them, or reſt on them in ſtead of Chriſt, but he is to make uſe of theſe, as Signs of Chriſts dwelling in him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as from an effect of Gods love he may rejoyce in, and be thankfull unto God.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, I will not draw in that diſpute neither, <hi>Whether this certainty Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit works in the godly, in and through the graces of Sanctification, be the only witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and ſealing that is?</hi> or, <hi>Whether there be not an immediate teſtimony of Gods Spirit to the ſoul, either before or without thoſe gracious fruits of holineſſe?</hi> For my part, I think the former kinde of witneſſing, <hi>viz.</hi> by fruits of holineſs, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſafe and ſure way, and which the Scripture doth for the moſt part commend. <hi>Theſe things promiſed, I bring the grounds of this Duty, to proceed to certainty of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification and regeneration, by the fruits of holineſſe iſſuing therefrom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt ſort of Arguments ſhall be <hi>from thoſe places of Scripture, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptive</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Argum. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>and characteriſtical of true grace from counterfeit;</hi> For therefore are thoſe differences ſo diligently preſſed, that every man may take heed, and diſcern the one from the other: <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. how copious is our Saviour in that Parable to give exact differences between the ſeveral grounds that received the ſeed, that is, the ſeveral workings upon mens hearts by the preaching of the Word, wherein ſome go very farre beyond others, yet only the good and honeſt heart was indeed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. Now upon this our Saviour ſaith, <hi>He that hath ears to hear let him hear,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, This matter doth deeply concern you, <hi>Examine your ſelves</hi> in what rank you are, how farre the word of God hath prevailed over you. If therefore the auditor could not have told when he was good ground, and when thorny, ſuch deſcriptions had been to no purpoſe; ſo <hi>John</hi> 10. 4, 5. there you have a deſcription of Chriſts ſheep, <hi>They hear his voice, a ſtranger they will not follow, but flee from him;</hi> where it is good to obſerve, that as in other places it is
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:30767:35"/>
made a mark of grace to take heed of ſin, and to love holineſſe; ſo here it is made a ſign of Chriſts ſheep, to take heed of errors and falſe teachers; They are afraid of falſe doctrines, as well as wicked waies: Oh how neceſſary is this ſign of grace to be preſſed in theſe times, to a people afraid of being led aſide from the true faith by any deceitfull pretexts whatſoever. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 12. there you have a catalogue of ſeveral graces, which flow from Election; <hi>Put on (as the elect of God) bowels of mercies,</hi> &amp;c. and generally whereſoever you finde deſcriptions of the properties of godlineſs, there ought we to parallel our lives with thoſe precedents, and ſee whether we expreſs them or no.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond ſort is <hi>From exhortatory places, where we are commanded to make</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Argum. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>this ſearch, Whether grace be truly in us or no?</hi> Now if ſuch a trial were not law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and uſefull, who dare ſay, the holy Spirit would preſcribe it? The Text I am upon, how clear is it, <hi>Examine, prove your ſelves, whether ye be in the Faith?</hi> Now if any one ſhould reply againſt the Apoſtle, This is ſuch a duty it cannot be done, its derogatory to Chriſt, it will make us reſt in our ſelves: how unſufferable had ſuch gain-ſaying been, <hi>Gal. 6. 4. But let every man prove his own work,</hi> &amp;c. where you have the duty of examining and ſearching the works we do, in the nature, ground, and intentions of them; and this is commanded as a remedy againſt arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy and pride, as appeareth <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. and this is alſo commended from the profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table effect thereof; he ſhall have rejoycing in himſelf alone, that is, his excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy ſhall not be apprehended by comparing himſelf with others that are worſe, or becauſe he is reputed godly in the judgement of others, but his comfort will be from within: and obſerve, in ſome ſenſe a rejoycing in a mans ſelf is lawfull, <hi>viz.</hi> as it is accompanied with a thankfull acknowledgment of the grace of God beſtowed on a man. But if we ſpeak in reſpect of Juſtification, then all matter of rejoycing or boaſting is excluded. In 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. you have a text that putteth this duty out of all queſtion, <hi>Wherefore the rather brethren, give all diligence to make your calling and election ſure;</hi> You will all grant election cannot be made more ſure in reſpect of God or it ſelf, but only in reſpect of us, that we may be more perſwaded of it. And how is that? he ſhewed in the verſes before, by adding grace to grace, and cauſing thoſe things to abound in them. This was the way to make all ſure, ſo that to proceed by way of Signes and Marks, is plainly enjoyned out of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.</p>
                  <p>A third rank is <hi>From thoſe places of Scripture which by way of example and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Argum. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>do prove, that the godly took their graces for ſigns and testimonies of Gods love, and thereby received much comfort;</hi> Yea, urged theſe, as an argument in praier for mercy, not by way of merit or cauſality, but as the effects of Gods grace, and ſo a further engagement for God to perfect his own work, 2 <hi>King. 20. 3. Hezekiah</hi> after he had laboured in a further Reformation, then any ever did before him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the true <hi>Hercules</hi> that purged the <hi>Augaean</hi> ſtable, is ſtricken with a mortal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe from God, and now in what exigencies is he plunged! a great Army againſt him, no viſible ſucceſſour in his Throne, all his Reformation is like to goe back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards! In the midſt of all this darkneſſe ſee with what he ſupports himſelf, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, O Lord, how I have walked before thee with an upright and perfect heart,</hi> &amp;c. Thus he uſed his graces for a ſign to confirm. The like did <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> Chap. 13. ſeveral times, eſpecially ſee his expreſſion <hi>verſ. 14. Remember me, O my God, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the houſe of my God.</hi> This place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth no Popery, as if <hi>Nehemiah</hi> thought his good deeds perfect, and ſo a cauſe of mercy, for mark his expreſſion <hi>verſ. 22. Remember me, O my God, and ſpare me ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the greatneſſe of thy mercy.</hi> Thoſe good deeds needed mercy and pardon, yea greatneſs of mercy; As it goeth not ſo high to eſtabliſh perfection or merit of works, yet it doth fully confirm this truth, That a godly man may take comfort from his graces as ſigns and teſtimonies of Gods love to him. And whereas <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> upon that paſſage of <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> maketh ſuch a narration of graces by the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, peculiar only to the Old Teſtament; it is like many other of his notions, falſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:30767:36"/>
and rotten; for <hi>Paul</hi> who was a continuall Trumpet of the grace of God, who counted all his own righteouſneſſe <hi>dung and droſſe to ſet up Chriſt,</hi> yet he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth alſo by way of ſigns, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 5. I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, hence forth is laid up for me a crown of glory; 2 Cor. 1. 12. Our rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of our conſcience, that in godly ſincerity, we have had our converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world,</hi> &amp;c. So that by this of <hi>Paul,</hi> you may ſee, that a Chriſtian may at the ſame time exalt Chriſt and his grace, going out of his own righteouſneſſe for Juſtification, yet take comfort alſo from it. The Hiſtory of <hi>Job</hi> doth alſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly confirm this truth, for when in the opinion of others God had caſt him off as an hypocrite, yet he would not part with the comfort of his integrity till death. In this caſe <hi>Job</hi> had no immediate conſolations from God, <hi>The arrows of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty ſtuck deep in him,</hi> he poſſeſſed the ſins of his youth, and there was nothing which did ſtay him, but the comfort of his upright heart; ſo that a godly mans ſenſe and feeling of Gods grace within him, is a great bulwark in time of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Neither is that of the Papiſts able to weaken this Aſſertion, when they ſay, Theſe experimental ſuavities which are felt in religious duties, do only beget a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural knowledge not an aſſurance of faith, becauſe the object thereof is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in Scripture; for it may well be granted that this ſenſe of believing is not an act of faith, and that a man doth not properly believe he doth believe, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly perceiveth and feeleth he doth believe, and ſo love God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet this ſenſe is not fallacious, becauſe it is from a ſupernaturall principle within.</p>
                  <p>A fourth rank ſhall be <hi>From thoſe comparative expreſſions the Scripture uſeth, when it ſpeaks of Grace.</hi> Thus they are called fruits, <hi>Luk. 3. 8. Gal. 6. 2 Cor.</hi> 9. 10. <note place="margin">Argum. 4.</note> Now our Saviour laieth down an undeniable Maxim, <hi>Matth. 12. 33. The tree is known by its fruit, a good tree by its good fruit:</hi> Hence a good heart is alſo called a <hi>good treaſury from whence good things flow;</hi> now although trees becauſe without reaſon and ſenſe, know not themſelves by their fruit, but others only do: yet the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God are by their good fruit both known to themſelves and others, yea more to themſelves then others, <hi>Becauſe no man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the spirit of a man:</hi> Grace alſo in the workings thereof is often compared to life, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 22. Now as a natural life is diſcerned by the actions thereof, as by ſo many ſigns, ſo alſo is ſupernatural life: but as in ſome diſeaſes the party affected percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not any life; ſo neither do the godly in ſome ſad temptations.</p>
                  <p>The fifth rank of Arguments may be <hi>From all thoſe promiſſory places of Scripture, which speak comfort and encouragement to thoſe that have ſuch and ſuch exerciſes of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Argum. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>grace: now theſe Promiſes would afford no comfort at all, if a Chriſtian could not by way of ſigns gather when he had them.</hi> The Scripture in ſeveral places attributes <hi>Bleſſedneſſe to him that feareth alwayes,</hi> To him <hi>that keeps the Law of God,</hi> To him <hi>that is undefiled therein,</hi> To him <hi>that endureth perſecution for a good cauſe,</hi> To him <hi>that is pure and me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>k in spirit.</hi> Now what encouragement could any godly man have, if he could not have this practical ſyllogiſme, The Scripture makes him that feareth, believeth, <hi>&amp;c. Bleſſed:</hi> but I am ſuch an one that doth fear, believe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore I am bleſſed; now although the <hi>major</hi> of this Propoſition be Scripture, yet the Aſſumption is from experience, a godly man being aſſiſted therein by the holy Ghoſt, and therefore the concluſion is undeniable.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Another rank of Arguments may be <hi>From all thoſe places of Scripture that are indicative, or eſtenſive of this truth;</hi> And for this, let us take <hi>John</hi> in his <note place="margin">Argum. 6.</note> firſt Epiſtle, who is moſt expreſſe in this way, as if he would on purpoſe deſtroy the contrary errour, 1 <hi>John 2. 3, 4, 5, Hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments,</hi> &amp;c. The Apoſtle compareth our imperfect or hypocritical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge with a true knowledge of Chriſt. The true knowledge is operative, and bringeth obedience: The hypocrites knowledge is light only, and no heat at all. Now the Apoſtle laieth down two Propoſitions, firſt, That where there is a true knowledge of Chriſt, there is an obſervation of his Commandments; Secondly,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:30767:36"/>
That by this obſervation of his Law, we may know that our knowledge is good. To the ſame purpoſe alſo he ſpeaketh in the two following verſes; firſt, For our faith, that it muſt not only be carried to Chriſt as a propitiation for ſinne, but alſo to him as an example whom we are to imitate, he ought to walk as Chriſt walked, and by this imitation of Chriſt (ſaith the Apoſtle) we know we are in him, where obſerve two things; Firſt, That by ſaith we come to be implanted in Chriſt. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, That we diſcover this our being in him by an holy walking; None there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that plead for Sanctification as an evidence of Juſtification, make our graces to be thoſe things that put us into Chriſt, and by which we are juſtified; but theſe are teſtimonies and witneſſes to declare the truth of our real being in Chriſt. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed we to the third Chapter, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. In this the children of God, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the devil are manifeſt, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in this, that relateth to the axioms going before, <hi>He that is born of God ſinneth not,</hi> which is thus to be underſtood, <hi>viz. He ſinneth not,</hi> from ſuch a full and habitual purpoſe of will, ſo as that his ſin extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth the ſeed of grace within him; now howſoever this manifeſtation of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God and of the devil to others be but conjectural, yet to the godly man, whoſe heart by regeneration is cured in part of that innate guile which cleaveth to it, it is clear without any deceit. At <hi>v.</hi> 13. the Apoſtle exhorteth the godly not to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if the world hate them; and to amplifie their conſolation herein he addeth <hi>v. 14. We know we are tranſlated from death to life, becauſe we love the brethren.</hi> This is the great ſign of godlineſs, to love another godly man, becauſe he is godly, and the more any is godly, the more to love him: as on the other ſide, to hate another becauſe his waies are good, and thine evil (which is too ordinary) is a demonſtration thou art of the devil; now this love of our brethren is not a cauſe of our tranſlation from death to life, for the very word <hi>[tranſlated]</hi> ſuppoſeth it a grace of God from without us, but it is a ſign only. Now although a Papiſt loveth a Papiſt, a Jew a Jew, thinking them more godly, when they are deceived therein, yet that doth not hinder a true godly man from loving another that is godly, and he have ſolid comfort therein: but more of this hereafter. The Apoſtle having made love of the brethren a ſign, he further explicates what this love is, not a complemental feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed love, but real and operative, for love is like fire, <hi>Si non operatur, non eſt,</hi> if it do not work it is an argument it is not at all, whereupon he maketh this again a ſign, by that expreſſion peculiar to the Apoſtle, hereby we know that we are of the truth, and ſhall aſſure our hearts before him, perſwade our hearts, as it is in the Greek, which implieth, That though the heart be full of doubts and unbelief, yet the diſcovery of ſuch grace within us, is able to ſatisfie our hearts, hereupon <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. he ſaith, <hi>If our hearts condemn us not, we have confidence towards God:</hi> Now here are two doubts; firſt, Whoſe heart doth not condemn him of much pride, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, neglect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therefore none can have confidence: But the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſuch a condemning, as is for total and reigning hypocriſie, not for partiall corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption which is in the moſt godly. A ſecond doubt may be of thoſe who perſecute the truth and the people of God, as the Jews and <hi>Paul</hi> did, whoſe hearts did not condemn them, but rather they thought they did God good ſervice; but the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh of Chriſtians endued with the true Doctrine and Knowledge of Chriſt out of his Word, and as for ſuch, if their hearts reprove them not for hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie, they have boldneſs with God. This Apoſtle is very frequent in urging the fruits of godlineſs by way of ſigns; but theſe may ſuffice to confirme the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Argument to prove this method by way of ſigns, may be thus urged, If <note place="margin">Argum. 7.</note> a Chriſtian may not gather the grace of Juſtification and Sanctification, by the fruits thereof, it would be for one of theſe grounds, either firſt the impoſſibility of it, as the Papiſts urge, it would not be poſſible for a man to know when grace is in him: but that is falſe, for howſoever a mans heart is naturally deceitfull, yet when regenerated, God takes away that guile in it, and ſo farre as it is ſpiritual it is ſincere and cannot lie; Or ſecondly, This would be uſeleſſe, having Aſſurance
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:30767:37"/>
by Gods Spirit, what needs evidences by inherent graces; This is to light a candle when the Sunne ſhineth; but the teſtimony of the Spirit, and the evidence of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces make up one compleat witneſſe, and therefore are not to be diſ-joyned, much leſſe oppoſed, as is further to be cleared. Thirdly, It may be thought prejudiciall, and that two waies, either to Chriſt and his righteouſneſs, as if the comfort from theſe would take us from relying wholly upon Chriſt; but we told you <hi>Paul,</hi> who did ſo omnifie and exalt Chriſt and his righteouſneſſe, yet took comfort from his graces wrought in him; or elſe it may be thought the diſcovery of grace in us may make us proud and ſecure; but neither will this follow, becauſe hereby the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart is ſtirred up to more thankfulneſs, watchfulneſs, leaſt we loſe ſuch a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and to fruitfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>Let the Uſe be to try our ſelves by this way of marks and ſignes which the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture giveth, and certainly there was never a time, wherein marks of grace may be more urged then now: how many place Religion in Opinions, in Diſputations, in Revelations! and the true power of Godlineſſe and Mortification is altogether neglected; This made the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> in his Epiſtle, and <hi>Paul</hi> frequently in his to ſpeak againſt the Gnoſticks, a ſect riſen up in their time, that planted Religion in Knowledge, and arrogated that to themſelves only, for which reaſon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles ſo much preſſed a godly and holy life: Therefore that thou maieſt not deceive thy own ſelf, ſtudy the Scripture-characters of grace, it may be all thoſe ſignes by which thou comforteſt thy ſelf, ſuch as abilities in duties, great enlargements, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a different Church-government from others, are not in Scripture any marks of holineſſe, eſpecially conſider it's the property of Chriſts ſheep, not to hear ſtrangers, to flie from errours. Certainly our Saviour <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. deſcribing the branches that are in him, takes no notice of their leaves, their bloſſoms, but their fruit: Oh be afraid leſt Chriſts coming to thee be like that of his to the fig-tree, he ſaw leaves on it, but no fruit; whereupon he pronounced that curſe, <hi>Never fruit grow on thee more:</hi> So Chriſt finde opinions, diſputations, many abilities and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward duties, but no true holineſſe, and therefore he curſe thee, ſaying, <hi>Never fruit grow on thee,</hi> Shoot forth into leaves and branches, but never bear fruit. It is to be feared many live with ſuch a viſible curſe upon them; Holineſs of life muſt bejoined to the abilities of the head, <hi>Quae bona opera Chriſtianus facit, tot aureos annulos in digitos miſerit,</hi> As many good and holy actions thou doſt, ſo many rings thou haſt upon thy hand; Theſe adorn thee more then gold or ſilver.</p>

                  <p>And the firſt is <hi>Rom. 8. 16. The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſſe with our ſpirit, that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>we are the ſons of God.</hi> In which words we may obſerve the Authour of the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, the manner, and the object of it. The Author is ſaid to be <hi>The Spirit it ſelf,</hi> where the Apoſtle makes it no Preſumption or Arrogancie for the people of God, to call God Father, becauſe they are encouraged and emboldened here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto by the Spirit of God. It is not a deluſion from the Devil, but an Aſſurance from Gods Spirit. In the next place there is the Manner of the Teſtimony, it is a conjoined Teſtimony, not a ſingle Witneſſe; Therefore it is ſaid <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it witneſſeth with. It is true, <hi>Grotius</hi> takes the word, though compounded, for a ſimple, <gap reason="foreign">

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, alledging two places for a parallel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 2. where the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the <hi>Conſcience bearing witneſſe,</hi> but theſe Texts are not cogent, for the conſcience in teſtifying doth witneſſe with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which is God, and therefore it is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſo that the witneſſe of the conſcience is not a ſingle Teſtimony. It being therefore to be underſtood of a <hi>Joint-witneſſe,</hi> the Queſtion is, What is the other partner that is joined with Gods Spirit in this action? Some underſtand the ſpirit of a man not to be the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſſer, but the ſubject only receiving the Teſtimony, and they render it thus, <hi>The Spirit beareth witneſſe to our ſpirit,</hi> not with our ſpirit, and then, ſome make the joint-witneſſe to be Chriſt, that as <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. the Apoſtle had affirmed, <hi>Chriſt dwelleth in us,</hi> then his Spirit, and that the Spirit made us <hi>to cry Abba Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> ſo here, the Spirit, with Chriſt, and the Father alſo ſuppoſed, as if it were the ſame with that 1 <hi>John 5. 7. There are three that bear witneſſe in heaven.</hi> But others referre it to that <hi>Voice</hi> cauſed in us by Gods Spirit, and that is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the gift of Regeneration. Thus <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> The Spirit of God, by or in that gift, which he beſtoweth on us; and in this ſenſe it will be all one whether we tranſlate it, <hi>to</hi> or <hi>with</hi> our ſpirit. So then the meaning is, The Spirit of God <hi>beareth witneſſe unto us,</hi> with thoſe gifts and graces that are the fruit of the ſame Spirit. So that he ſpeaks not of ſuch an immediate Teſtimony, as the Prophets had in their viſions, when they heard God ſpeak immediately to them, but me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by and with our ſpirits, being enlightned and ſanctified: So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Spirit of God be the alone Author of this Aſſurance, yet it is in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary way by the fruits of the Spirit. Now the Spirit of God may be conceived
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:30767:38"/>
witneſſing this infallibly and ſurely, or elſe conjecturally, and by way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability. Popiſh Commentators expound it the latter way, but it is very unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and derogatory, to make the Spirit of God Author of a conjectural Certainty only, for it being a divine Teſtimony it cannot but have infallibility: and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if he ſaid of the conſcience, which yet hath much error and falſhood in it, that it was <hi>mille teſtes</hi> a thouſand witneſſes, how much rather may this be ſaid of the Spirit of God? but more of this place hereafter.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond place is <hi>Epheſ. 1. 13. In whom after ye believed, ye were ſealed with</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Epheſ. 1. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>the holy Spirit of Promiſe.</hi> Where you have this Witneſſing or Aſſurance expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed metaphorically by ſealing, which is uſed to ratifie and confirm things; now God doth thus ſeal us, not for his ſake, but ours, that we may be perſwaded of his love; God doth not ſeal as a Merchant his wares, that he may know them, but as a Father doth his Teſtament, or deeds of Gift, to aſſure his Childe of ſuch favour towards him. But you will ſay, What is this ſealing? The Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor will declare it: As in ſealing, the Seal makes an impreſſion of its own like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the wax; ſo God in ſealing unto us makes an impreſſion of his own holy image in us, and by this we are aſſured. They therefore who underſtand this ſealing of the extraordinary and miraculous gifts of Gods Spirit, hit not the mark, becauſe theſe were not neceſſary ſignes of Adoption, and alſo they were not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon every particular believer; we muſt therefore underſtand it of the ſanctifying graces of Gods Spirit: And here you may alſo obſerve that faith whereby we receive Chriſt firſt, is not the evidence, as ſome plead, becauſe it is after their believing, for the word is in the time paſt: that it is meant of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, doth appear alſo by the words following, <hi>Sealed by the holy Spirit of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe,</hi> where the Spirit of God is called the Spirit of the Promiſe, either becauſe he doth confirm the Promiſes, or elſe becauſe he is the fruit of the Promiſe; and holy, becauſe of the holineſſe he works in his children, which is their ſealing; ſo that as God the Father is ſaid to ſeal Chriſt, when he gave him thoſe abilities which were required to a Mediator, annointing him with all grace, and witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by miracles he was his Son; Thus doth God the Father ſeal his children to him by furniſhing them with all the graces of his holy Spirit, and by theſe they know they are of God.</p>
                  <p>The third Text and laſt is, 1 <hi>John 5. 8. There are three that bear witneſſe on earth,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 John 5. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>water, and bloud, and the Spirit.</hi> I ſhould quickly tire you out, to ſpeak all that is ſaid by Expoſitors on this place, I ſhall therefore briefly aſſert this Expoſition, as moſt ſutable to other places of Scripture; <hi>By Water</hi> is meant that purifying and cleanſing from the filth of ſinne, which we receive by Chriſt, ſignified in the outward ſeal of Baptiſm: <hi>By Bloud</hi> is meant that expiation of the guilt of ſinne, and ſatisfying of Gods wrath, which is alſo ſealed in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper: And <hi>by Spirit</hi> is meant Gods Spirit, not immediately teſtifying, for ſo it is a Witneſſe in heaven, but by the fruits thereof, ſtirring up faith to a vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and powerfull way of holineſſe, by which means we perceive the fruit of water and bloud accompliſhed in our ſouls. But I muſt not ſtay longer on theſe places, I ſhall propound ſome Doubts only to make this duty of going by ſignes more clear and eaſie to you.</p>
                  <p>As in the firſt place, <hi>Doth it not argue weakneſſe and unbelief in a Chriſtian to walk by ſigns? Is not this to derogate from the glorious promiſe of grace, as if that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obj.</note> 
                     <hi>were not enough?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to anſwer, Firſt, <hi>Signs do not argue an abſolute weakneſſe, but comparative only.</hi> In heaven, all Sacraments, which are ſignes and ſeals, ſhall ceaſe. Whether <note place="margin">Anſ. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Adam</hi> had any Sacrament in the ſtate of perfection, is diſputed. The Tree of life is judged ſo by ſome, but it could not be a Sacrament in that particular ſenſe as ours are, which ſeal Remiſſion of ſin and Mortification of it, but in a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral way, for Sacraments have two things in them, 1. That which is general, to continue God to be our God, and we his children, its alſo our communion with
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:30767:38"/>
others. And in this ſenſe Chriſt was baptized, and was made partaker of other Sacraments (for we may not ſay, Chriſt therefore uſed the Sacraments, that he might ſanctifie them, for they were ſanctified by their inſtitution.) 2. There is that which is ſpecial in the Sacraments, <hi>viz.</hi> Remiſſion of ſinne, encreaſe of grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thus onely the members of the militant Church do partake of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It cannot be denied but that it is a more noble and excellent way to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>in the Promiſe, by a faith of dependency and adherence, then to believe upon the ſenſe and evidence of Graces in us, yet this latter alſo is lawfull and encouraged by God;</hi> For therefore it was that God gave the gift of miracles, that by ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull things appearing to ſenſe, they might be perſwaded to believe in God. We have a clear inſtance in <hi>Thomas</hi> John 20. where he is reproved for his unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief: but upon his ſeeing and feeling the wounds of Chriſt, he makes a clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, <hi>My God, and my Lord.</hi> This was laudable in him, but yet ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>Bleſſed are they that believe and ſee not.</hi> Where <hi>Thomas</hi> is not excluded from bleſſedneſſe, though he did believe and ſee, but only the former ſhew forth a more bleſſed work of grace upon themſelves. We may therefore believe becauſe of Gods Word; and we may believe becauſe of ſenſe: this may be an help to our faith, and therefore God hath appointed Sacraments for this end, not that the things we ſee are properly the object of our faith, for <hi>Ubi vides, non fides, Faith is the evidence of things not ſeen.</hi> Thus <hi>Thomas</hi> had one thing for the object of his ſight and feeling, which was the wounds of Chriſts body, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing for the object of his faith, which was, That Chriſt was God. Thus in the Sacrament, That which is the object of our ſenſe, is not the object of our faith, only we are helpt by theſe, as motives to believe. Although therefore to have any help from ſenſe to believe, be a comparative weakneſſe, yet ſuppoſing this condition we are in, it is a duty to be encouraged thereby. Hence he that did believe becauſe of miracles, did his duty, and ſinned not therein: yea <hi>Ahaz</hi> is ſeverely rebuked, becauſe he would not take a ſigne to confirm his faith in the promiſe God made for the Kingdoms deliverance.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Doubt, <hi>When we receive evidence from our graces, do we not receive an</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Doubt 2.</note> 
                     <hi>humane teſtimony, to witneſſe the things of God, and how incongruous is that?</hi> Such as the object is, ſuch the teſtimony ought to be, but the object witneſſed is Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, <hi>viz.</hi> that we are the children of God, and therefore the Witneſſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ought to be Divine. This ſome have preſſed againſt evidences by ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>But firſt, <hi>An humane teſtimony may be an introductory preparation, to believe that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>which is Divine.</hi> And in this ſenſe, there is an humane Witneſſe to the things of God. Thus the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> witneſſed of Chriſt, and they wer moved by her teſtimony, although afterwards they did believe, becauſe of Chriſt himſelf. Thus alſo <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> bare Witneſſe of Chriſt; and in this ſenſe our Divines ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the Authority of the Church, and ſo explain that of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>He would not have believed the Scriptures, had not the Authority of the Church moved him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>We ſay not the Graces of Gods Spirit, can or do witneſſe of themſelves,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>The ſealing and witneſſing is efficiently from the Spirit of God, they are only the means by which Gods Spirit makes known it ſelf.</hi> And therefore as colours, though they be the object of ſight, yet they cannot actually be ſeen without light ſhining up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: ſo neither are we able to behold the good things God hath wrought for us without the Spirit of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Graces of God thus colluſtrated, are not an humane teſtimony, but di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>and infallible.</hi> For its a ſupernatural teſtimony, both in the efficient cauſe, and in the means by which; ſo that as the godly actions we do are not humane, or by the power of free-will, but divine ariſing from a ſupernatural principle of grace within us; ſo neither is this teſtimony or conſolation flowing from it, to be
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:30767:39"/>
attributed to our reaſon and underſtanding, but unto God only. The Papiſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed makes theſe experimental works of grace within us to be onely moral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, and probable indications of Gods Spirit dwelling in us: onely they ſay, it is ſuch a certainty as may morally exclude all doubting, for they inſtance, that we may be as ſure that we are in the ſtate of grace, as that there is ſuch a City as <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> (if we have not ſeen thoſe places) but this is not enough, becauſe they deny them to be the infallible witneſſe of Gods Spirit.</p>
                  <p>A third Doubt, <hi>Are not evidences of Grace by ſigns uſeleſſe, ſeeing the Spirit of God doth immediately work in our hearts a ſtrong Aſſurance of faith? and having</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Doubt 3.</note> 
                     <hi>this Aſſurance, what need we any other?</hi> If we have the Sun, what need is there of a candle? Hence ſome have reduced the whole Doctrine of evidences to two heads; 1. The revealing evidence, and that they make an immediate Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made by Gods Spirit to the ſoul. Even as when the Sun-beams are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately darted into a dark room. And the ſecond is a receiving evidence, and that they make faith, and you know it hath formerly been generally received, <hi>That Faith is a full perſwaſion of Gods love to a mans ſelf in particular;</hi> which if ſo, the whole buſineſſe of evidence ſeemeth to be accompliſhed before we come to any ſignes.</p>
                  <p>But to anſwer firſt, <hi>It may juſtly be queſtioned, Whether out of the Scripture there can be proved any ſuch immediate voice ſpoken by Goas Spirit to a man, that his</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Anſ. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>ſins are forgiven him, and he is in the ſtate of grace?</hi> So that although they take this for granted, that God doth immediately come into the ſoul, and witneſſe unto it, yet we ſee by the Texts opened before, that its more conſonant to Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, to make the Scriptures teſtimony active in reſpect of the effects and fruits thereof: Some Divines do not indeed deny the poſſibility of ſuch an immediate Teſtimony, but yet they conclude the ordinary and ſafe way, is, to look for that Teſtimony, which is by the effects, and fruits of Gods Spirit. Therefore when we ſpeak of the Spirit of God revealing, which is often mentioned in the Scripture, we may either conceive of it, as it did reveal in an <hi>Enthuſiaſtical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> by an immediate influence, or elſe that the Spirit of God doth enlighten the underſtanding to ſee grounds and reaſons, why it ſhould be perſwaded ſo. And here is a vaſt difference between theſe two; we may explain this about the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, A believer is fully perſwaded of the Divine Authority of the Scripture, through the Spirit of God revealing this to him; now this may be underſtood two waies, either <hi>by immediate Dictates of the Spirit,</hi> telling the ſoul it is ſo, or elſe <hi>by enlightning the underſtanding</hi> to ſee thoſe implanted arguments in it, and by them to perſwade of the Authority thereof. As it is thus for the Word, ſo for the work of Gods Spirit in us, we come to be perſwaded of Gods love to us, and aſſured of it, not becauſe of an Authority teſtifying this immediately, but becauſe Gods Spirit doth ſo efficiently enlighten the heart, that ſeeing ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious operations there, we come confidently perſwaded of Gods love to us: Thus the Sunne manifeſteth it ſelf to be the Sunne by the light that cometh from it. A learned man proveth himſelf to be learned by the learning he diſcovers, and thus the Spirit of God by and with the holy operations thereof, manifeſts it ſelf to be the Spirit of God dwelling in us, <hi>Argumento inſito, non extrinſecus aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumpto;</hi> but of this more in time.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It ought to be denied, that faith is ſuch a full perſwaſion.</hi> The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture words which expreſſe faith, ſpeak of it as <hi>Affiance</hi> and <hi>Adherence,</hi> rather <note place="margin">2. Faith not a full perſwaſion.</note> then a <hi>Perſwaſion,</hi> for that is a <hi>reflex Act</hi> in the ſoul, whereby we know that we do know (as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> expreſſeth it) and that we do <hi>truly repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Suppoſe ſuch evidences were granted, yet this by way of ſignes were not in vain, for it hath pleaſed God to multiply thoſe things which may confirm our faith.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> Thus although every word of God hath immutable verity in it, <hi>Yet he confirmed it alſo with an oath,</hi> after the manner of men, to end all thoſe controverſies which
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:30767:39"/>
diffidence and diſtruſt may raiſe between God and us. The Apoſtle aggravateth this <hi>Heb. 6. 16. That by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lie, we might have ſtrong conſolations.</hi> Again, although God hath given us his Promiſe, and nothing can be ſurer then that, yet he addeth Sacraments to ſeal and confirm his Promiſe unto us; Therefore though ſuch Aſſurances were granted, yet there is great uſefulneſſe of the evidences we have by ſignes.</p>
                  <p>A fourth Doubt <hi>may be from that univerſal received Maxim, None may be at the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Doubt 4.</note> 
                     <hi>ſame time</hi> Reus <hi>and</hi> Judex, <hi>the Perſon queſtioned and the Judge: but this abſurdity would follow, if we proceed by evidences,</hi> for the heart of a man is queſtioned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it hath true grace in it, and the heart alſo muſt be Judge of this at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p>We anſwer, <hi>This would not follow, for although the heart be in ſuppoſed guilt, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> 
                     <hi>ſo queſtioned, yet the judging of this, is by the Spirit of God, and our hearts not as guilty, but as ſanctified; and all this according to the rules of Scripture.</hi> Indeed this abſurdity followeth in a phariſaical or formal man, who is altogether carnal, and hath not the Spirit of God, or any ſupernatural principles; when he acquitteth himſelf, he is both the guilty Perſon, and the Judge too; and by this means they give falſe judgement, calling evil good, and darkneſſe light, but it is not thus with believers.</p>
                  <p>A fifth Doubt <hi>may be from the difficulty, if not impoſſibility of any certainty by</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Doubt 5.</note> 
                     <hi>ſignes:</hi> for take we any ſigne, ſuppoſe love of the brethren, that muſt be explained of ſuch love as is becauſe they are brethren, and of ſuch a love as proceedeth from upright principles, and pure motives, and with many other qualifications, which will be as hard to know, as the inward root of grace it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Now to this we anſwer theſe things: Firſt, <hi>That the Scripture giveth many</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Anſ. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Signs and Symptomes of grace;</hi> So that if a man cannot finde all, yet if he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſome, yea, if but one, he may aſſuredly gather all the reſt are there, for the whole harmony and connexion of grace is compared to the image of God, which doth conſiſt of all its due lineaments; ſo that it is hard if a Chriſtian doubt of all, ſo that he can finde nothing of Gods Spirit in him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>There is a two-fold Knowledge,</hi> one <hi>Diſtinct and Demonſtrative,</hi> which <note place="margin">2.</note> is <hi>à priori,</hi> from the cauſe to the effect, and that is, when we know the principles and root of grace within us, and ſo proceed to the effects of it. The other is more <hi>General,</hi> and that is from the effect to the cauſe, and this is a knowledge <hi>à poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riori,</hi> we proceed from the ſtreams to the fountain, and this kinde of knowledge as it is moſt eaſie, ſo we are prone to, and the Spirit of God guideth us in this way, as being moſt ſutable to our natures.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Although a man may doubt of ſome Signs, yet it doth not follow he will</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>doubt of all, becauſe his temptation may be ſtronger about one Sign then another, and one Sign may be more eaſily perceived then another;</hi> And ſo a godly man may argue from that which is leſſe known, to the other that is more known; even as in the matter of the Canon of the Scripture, ſome have doubted whether ſuch books were Canonical or no, becauſe the Arguments of Divine Authority were more irradiant in the other then in them, yet from thoſe Books concerning the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of which they were not tempted, they were at laſt induced to believe the Authority of thoſe that were controverted. In this manner it may be about the ſignes of grace. It is more difficult to finde ſome of them in our ſelves then others, yet we are to proceed from thoſe that are more facile, to thoſe that are more difficult.</p>
                  <p>The ſixth Doubt, <hi>A man may be eaſily deceived in theſe wayes of Signs, for this</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Doubt 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Knowledge conſiſteth of a practical Syllogiſm thus, Every one that loveth the brethren is tranſlated from death to life, But I love the brethren, Therefore I am tranſlated from death to life.</hi> Therefore a late Authour <hi>(Cornwell</hi> in his Treatiſe of Juſtification,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:30767:40"/>
                     <hi>pag.</hi> 17.) denieth, <hi>The faith wrought in ſuch a practical Syllogiſm, to be by the power of the Lord Almighty, but only in the ſtrength of humane reaſon, and therefore is only an humane faith.</hi> But this is a very dangerous Aſſertion, and like that which the Jeſuites would impoſe upon the Proteſtants concerning a doctrinal Faith thus, There is <hi>Veroniana Methodus,</hi> by which the Jeſuites would conclude the Proteſtants have no faith, becauſe (ſay they) the object of faith muſt be according to the Proteſtants, <hi>Purum putum verbum Dei,</hi> the meer word of God, but now there is nothing, which the Proteſtants believe, but they conclude it by way of a Syllogiſm, and in this Syllogiſm, the Aſſumption or the meer infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is not in Scripture, or they may erre in making the inference, and ſo they have no concluſion <hi>de fide.</hi> But all this is ſophiſtry, for a proxim and immediate concluſion is in the principle, and ſo believed with the ſame faith that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is, and when a man by reaſon makes a concluſion, his reaſon is only the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, not the Argument of his faith, his reaſon is not the ground of his faith, nor doth it ſuggeſt the matter to be believed, but is the inſtrument to diſcover it. As he that diggeth in a mine of gold, his inſtruments he uſeth in removing the earth that covered it, do not make the gold, but diſcover it. And as for this practical Syllogiſm, it is not made by meer humane reaſon, for when the ſoul makes the aſſumption, it doth it, being ſanctified and enlightned by the Spirit of God, and ſo is an inſtrument in his hand, for there is the ſame proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Spirit of God in ſpiritual things, and reaſon in philoſophical things; ſo that as in Philoſophy, reaſon makes the <hi>major</hi> and <hi>minor</hi> in any Syllogiſm; ſo in ſpiritual things, the Spirit of God enableth a man to make a whole Syllogiſm for a believers comfort and eſtabliſhment.</p>
                  <p>Uſe of Inſtruction, How much they are deceived, who viſibly expreſſe the power of ſin and Satan in their lives, yet acquit themſelves as the children of <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> God!

Though our Saviour told the <hi>Phariſees, They were the children of the Devil, and his works they did,</hi> yet they would flatter themſelves that they were the <hi>Children of Abraham.</hi> Doth not the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>The works of the fleſh are manifeſt, envyings, railings, drunkenneſſe, &amp;c.</hi> Yet how bold are men that live in theſe impieties? Do the Sacraments ſeal theſe things to be done? Doth the Word command theſe? Did Chriſt die to make us ſuch a people?

                  <p>I Shall now cloſe up this Text, finiſhing alſo that Diſcourſe about the ſignes of Grace. The work that remaineth at this time, is to advertiſe you againſt thoſe many rocks you may ſplit at, while you proceed by ſigns; for although this method (as you have heard) be lawfull, and a duty, yet there is required much art and skill to mannage this work, inſomuch that herein he ought to have his ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern between good and evil.</p>
                  <p>Now the miſcarriages about Signs may be divers waies: As</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>About the Signs themſelves;</hi> and that either on the right hand, or left; <note place="margin">1. Dangers on the right-hand.</note> on the right-hand, <hi>By preſcribing to our ſelves ſuch Signs as are impoſſible to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this life.</hi> Thus there is an Anabaptiſtical and a Popiſh perfection, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men are taught to finde ſuch a perfect mark of grace, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> that no ſin ſhall be in them, at leaſt for ſome ſpace of time: but it is no marvel if the ſoul be perpetual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tormented that ſeeketh for ſuch a ground of comfort within it own ſelf. <hi>John</hi> who 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. makes the keeping of Gods Commandments a ſigne whereby we are of the truth, doth yet <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 8. ſay, <hi>That if we ſay we have no ſinne, we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our ſelves;</hi> yet herein Gods children make many ſad wounds for themſelves, not diſtinguiſhing between the truth and eſſence of grace, and the degrees of it. Whereas the Scripture makes them <hi>bleſſed that hunger and thirſt,</hi> yea it doth often deſcribe the godly by their deſires, and <hi>ſeeking of his face;</hi> now this error is the more faſtened upon them, becauſe when they reade in books, or hear Miniſters preach about the nature and properties of any grace, they are not able to finde it in ſuch a vigorous and powerfull manner in themſelves, whereas they ought to know, it is one thing to ſpeak of grace <hi>in Idea in ſe,</hi> in its own nature and definition, another thing to ſpeak of it, as <hi>in ſubjecto,</hi> as the Subject partakes of it. When the Miniſters of God preſſe any grace upon you, they commonly do it in the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted nature of it, as it hath its perfecteſt lineaments and ſhape, but as this grace is received in the ſubject, ſo it is much debilitated.</p>
                  <p>But as ſome torture themſelves by ſeeking that in themſelves which cannot be found, <hi>So there are more that turn to the left ſide, making many things ſigns of grace,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Danger on the left-hand.</note> 
                     <hi>which are not proper characters.</hi> Thus the Sacraments, outward Ordinances, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Opinion and Judgement, great Abilities in religious Duties, but all theſe may be in an heart unregenerated, as appeareth in thoſe, who ſaid, <hi>Have not we propheſied in thy name?</hi> Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That neither circumciſion, or uncircumciſion availeth any thing, but a new creature.</hi> They therefore that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe godlineſs by theſe common Marks, do as <hi>Socrates</hi> (if I miſtake not) that defined a man to be <hi>animal bipes implume;</hi> and <hi>Diogenes</hi> brought a Cock plucked of his feathers, to ſhew this was <hi>Socrates</hi> his man. As a man is to be defined by that only which is eſſential, ſo muſt a godly man be notified by that only which
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:30767:41"/>
notifieth godlineſſe. Therefore thoſe many Symptoms, by which many impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate grace and godlineſſe to themſelves, as outward Ordinances, a different way of Church-Government, great inward enlargements of it, are no infallible tokens; Therefore to drive people out of their holds, I ſhall in time ſelect the choiſeſt falſe ſigns, and make diſtinct Sermons upon them; for as the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Antichriſt ſhall come with falſe ſigns, which ſhall be ſo ſpecious that the very elect will be in danger to be deceived; ſo the hypocriſie and guile of our own hearts is ſo exceeding great that we many times take our copper graces for gold. Know then that whatſoever ſigns are taken up by thee, if they be not ſuch as are eſſential, from which there is a neceſſary inference of the ſtate of grace, thou ventureſt thy ſoul upon uncertain reeds.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>There is a danger about marks of grace, when we try not our graces by</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. There is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger when we try not our graces by a true touchſtone.</note> 
                     <hi>a true touchſtone.</hi> When the Apoſtle commands us <hi>to examine and prove our ſelves,</hi> it ſuppoſeth there is a ſure Canon and Rule to go by, which is to meaſure and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate thoſe things we doubt of. And that is the word of God, which <hi>David</hi> cals <hi>the light and lanthorn to his feet;</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> commends them as thoſe that are <hi>able to make us wiſe to Salvation;</hi> So that as when we are commanded to <hi>try the Spirits,</hi> and Doctrines of men, there is implied a recourſe to the Scriptures, which is the only Starre to lead us, inſomuch that the whole building of our faith muſt be cut out of this Mountain, and from this brook are all <hi>Davids</hi> to fetch their ſtones, which they ſhall ſling in the head of every <hi>Goliah</hi> (I mean every heretick) inſomuch that in matters of Doctrine, a man doth truly ſay, <hi>Non credo, quia non lego,</hi> I do not believe it, becauſe I do not read it. Thus it is alſo in thoſe injunctions, which are to ſearch and try our hearts, for thoſe do ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Scripture to be the true Standard, and whatſoever is too light or faulty, muſt be diſcovered by this; for as God is the <hi>Principium eſſendi,</hi> the beginning or cauſe of the being of grace; ſo Gods word is the <hi>Principium cognoſcendi,</hi> the principle by which we know what is true grace; now from this it is that moſt men do ſo eaſily perſwade themſelves of their being in a good eſtate, becauſe they judge of godlineſſe, by the principles of the world and humane grounds, not by Scripture-directions; Scripture-godlineſſe is as different from the moral mans godlineſſe as the Sunne is from a Glow-worm. Though this hath a little luſtre in a dark night, yet indeed it is nothing but a ſlimy, earthy worm, inſomuch that we may truly ſay of all the civil, moral and refined lives of men in Chriſtianity, who have not the power of Regeneration in them. What <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſaid of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca, Si i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ſpicias illum ut Paganus, Chriſtianè ſcripſit, ſi ut Chriſtianus, Paganicè.</hi> If you look as an Heathen upon him, then he ſeemeth to you to write as if he were a Chriſtian; but if you look upon him as a Chriſtian, then he ſeemeth to write as an Heathen. Thus it is here, look upon many mens lives, they are ſo full of ingenuity, righteouſneſſe and juſtice in their dealings, ſo much ſweetneſs and candour in their ſpirits, that if as an Heathen you would look upon them, you would call them divine and holy men, but then look upon them as a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an inſtructed out of the Scripture, and obſerve how unacquainted they are with a broken and contrite heart, how ignorant of Faith and the inward work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, then you will ſay, they are only baptized Heathens, for even among them we can ſhew ſuch men. If therefore you would not precipitate your ſoul into a gulf, take up the right rule, before you go to meaſure your ſelves. Thou maieſt be admired and much applauded by others for thy goodneſs and piety (as the Phariſees were) and yet be abominable before God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Then do we miſcarry about Signs, when we make uſe of them in a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial way to thoſe direct and immediate acts of Faith, whereby we receive and apply</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. Or when we make uſe of ſigns in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial way to the immediate acts of faith.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt to our ſouls.</hi> For the great work of a Chriſtian is out of the ſenſe and feeling of its own want and ſpiritual poverty, to roll himſelf, and reſt only upon Chriſt for Atonement and Reconciliation, that is that faith <gap reason="foreign">

This is that whereby we are juſtified; this is that whereby we ſet up Chriſt, and give glory unto God. Now it many times fals out, that while a godly man is poring and digging into his own heart to finde grace there, he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets to exerciſe applicative acts of Faith, ſo as thereby to cloſe with Chriſt. Alas, though the ſight of thy graces be comfortable, yet that of Chriſt ought to be much more. Theſe graces are but the handmaids and ſervants that wait upon Chriſt, they are but tokens from him, they are not himſelf: A man is not only to go out of his ſins, but alſo out of his graces unto Chriſt. See <hi>Paul,</hi> Phil. 3. how excellently doth he debaſe all his own graces to be found in Chriſt. Let not therefore the deſire after inherent righteouſneſſe make thee forget imputed righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe; This is to take the friend of the Bridegroom for the Bridegroom it ſelf; and for this end (without doubt) it is that the people of God are ſo often in darkneſſe and have no light, ſee no comfortable ſign or token of Gods love unto them, that ſo they may ſtay themſelves upon God. This truſting in God and in Chriſt, when we feel nothing but guilt and deſtruction in our ſelves, is the greateſt honour we can give God, and therefore though the living by ſignes be more comfortable to us, yet the living by faith is greater honour to God. Hence it is that the life of a godly man, is called a life of faith, becauſe though God may many times encourage him with thoſe ſenſible evidences, yet he doth morefre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently call them to combate and conflict with ſenſe &amp; reaſon. Do not therefore be unacquainted with this way of relying on Chriſt in the midſt of all darkneſs, for God many times will cauſe an eclipſe of thy ſigns, thou ſhalt many times look into thy heart, and find no comfort at all, ſee nothing but barrennes, hypocriſy, and every thing that may make thee tremble and be aſtoniſhed at thy ſelf, and then the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate depending upon, and adhering unto a promiſe, will be thy only refuge.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>We miſcarry about Signs, when we make them more then Signs, even grounds and</hi>

It is worthy our obſervation, when <hi>Peter</hi> in the name of the Apoſtles <hi>Mat.</hi> 8. 24. had profeſſed <hi>they had left all and followed Chriſt,</hi> with ſome kind of pride and carnal confidence, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon asking, what ſhould they have? our Saviour to humble them, and to keep them low in theirown eies, ſpeaks a Parable to infer this truth, <hi>That many which are first ſhall be last, and many that are laſt ſhall be firſt,</hi> which whether you expound in this ſenſ (as ſome do) many that were firſt, both in order of time and zeal of affection to do God ſervice, yet wanting the truth of grace and inward humility; <hi>Shall be laſt,</hi> that is none at all in the Kingdom of heaven, or if you explain it (as others) <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that are firſt,</hi> that is, who have been exceeding forward and active for God, and that with truth of grace, yet being puft up with pride, and truſting in themſelves, as the Apoſtles at that preſent were; <hi>Shall be laſt,</hi> that is, ſhall have leſſe glory and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in heaven. Whether (I ſay) of theſe Expoſitions you take, they are both terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſufficient to take us from pride and ſecurity. when we diſcover Gods gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in us, the diſcovery of grace in thee, is to make thee walk more comfortably and thankfully unto God, not to cauſe any tumors or ſwellings in thy own ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>When we try our ſelves by Signs, we ſhall deceive our own ſelves, if we caſt not</hi>

not know their own hearts, when they cried <hi>The Temple of the Lord,</hi> and aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Sacrifices. This knowing of our own hearts is a ſupernatural leſſon, taught only by the Spirit of God. Oh this ſelf-flattery, how doth it damn its thouſands, men making it no queſtion, but they do repent and love God, when yet Chriſt hath ſaid, <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen,</hi> that is, of thoſe many that are called by God to the enjoyment of Church-Ordinances and Priviledges, few have thoſe true works of grace, which are proper to the elect only! O how ſhould this terrible ſentence ſpoken by Chriſt himſelf, make thee queſtion again and again, yea a thouſand times again, whether thou art called only, and no more, not choſen at all! for they are few.</p>
                  <p>The other ſinfull principle to be ejected, is <hi>unbelief and ſuſpitious jealouſie over our ſelves,</hi> not giving credit to what we ſee and feel in our own ſouls, but argue and cavil againſt it. For as while a man is in the ſtate of unregeneration, he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in love with himſelf, and cannot be brought to loath and diſlike himſelf, as you ſee in <hi>Paul</hi> while unconverted; ſo when the Spirit of God hath throughly humbled us, made us ſee our beaſtlineſſe and filthineſſe, then we run into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extream, not taking notice of, but even denying the work of God upon our hearts; Their hearts did once ſo deceive them, that now they know not how to truſt them any more. Hence the people of God are ſubject to no temptation ſo much as this, Whether they be ſincere and upright, they look only to the evil they finde in themſelves, not the good God hath wrought in them; whereas it is their duty to take notice of all the good God hath vouchſafed to them: for how ſhall they be thankfull unto God, and acknowledge him, if they be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant herein?</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>When they do not take the fit ſeaſon, then they alſo are in danger of miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</hi> Now then it is unſeaſonable, when they are full of dark, and black tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, <note place="margin">6. And when men take not the fit ſeaſon to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in.</note> for then are they in a miſt, and not able to ſee things aright, while <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> is diſtracted with Gods terrors upon him, that doth eclipſe his judgement; How often doth <hi>David</hi> in ſad exigents think God hath forſaken him? When the looking-glaſſe is broke in ſeveral pieces, it doth repreſent the face of a man much deformed; The muddied water is not fit to give the true ſhape of the face, and thus it is here, the heart full of temptations within, and ſollicited with Satans injections from without, putteth the ſoul upon an amazement. The inceſtuous perſon, though truly repenting of his ſin, yet takes no comfort, but is even ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up by Satan, Signs thereof from within do not at ſuch times affect, and no marvel when Gods ſigns without, the Sacraments that are ſeals of his love, do not perſwade him.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>When they apprehend no Sign ſufficient, unleſſe they have had an actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al perſeverance to the end.</hi> Now although it be true, that the good ground dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <note place="margin">7. Alſo when no ſign will ſuffice till they have an actual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance to the end.</note> from the bad, in that it held out to the end, yet that was not the only, nor the principal difference, but this perſeverance was an effect flowing from the nature of the good ſoul. Although therefore afflictions and perſecutions do detect the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of many, as appeareth <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. yet it doth not follow, that therefore none can have Aſſurance, but ſuch who are come to their journies end. The <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> indeed much preſſe this, and therefore they hold, <hi>There is no abſolute and peremptory Election, but upon perſeverance in faith and obedience.</hi> Hence they joyn with that of the Poet, <hi>Ante obitum,</hi> No man is happy before his death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they may decline and apoſtatize from what they had. It cannot be denied but the revolt and degeneration of thoſe who have ſeemed pillars in the Church of God, hath much affrighted the godly, making them alſo fear, as if one day or other, in one temptation or other they ſhould fall away: but they are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, That whereſoever grace is already truly wrought in a mans heart, there God hath made a promiſe to keep us till the end, ſo that we may be aſſured of perſeverance as well as of our preſent righteouſneſſe, for <hi>God who beginneth a good work in us, will alſo make an end;</hi> and we have a gracious promiſe of Gods care to

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t is in matter of evidence. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thoſe godly exerciſes of grace be plentifull and copious in thee, yet thy heart is not perſwaded of this, till Gods Spirit eſtabliſh and confirm thy heart. Do not therefore think that by the ſtrength of thy natural light, thou canſt attain to this certainty.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, <hi>When we think it a duty not to lay hold on Christ at all, till we have this</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">9. Or when we think it a duty not to lay hold on Chriſt till we have this certainty by Signs.</note> 
                     <hi>Certainty by Signs.</hi> Believers are very prone to think, that the firſt work they have to do, when called to God, is to ſee whether they have true qualifications in them; and upon the Certainty of this, then to apply Chriſt for Juſtification. But this is not the Scripture method, for that cals the hungry, the thirſty, the loaded and burdened; and where this need and deſire of Chriſt is, ſuch are called <hi>to come unto him;</hi> Therefore certainly that we have truth of grace is not an antecedent to juſtifying faith, but a conſequent fruit of it. Hence that received opinion, <hi>That faith is a fiducial or ſtrong perſwaſion that my ſins are pardoned,</hi> hath juſtly cauſed many doubts, for this is not juſtifying faith, but a fruit of it. Hence <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. we are ſaid <hi>To have boldneſſe and acceſſe to him through faith.</hi> And when the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. ſaith, <hi>The life he liveth is by faith in Chriſt, who gave himſelf for me, and loved me;</hi> he was not juſtified by this believing, but this did rather ſuppoſe him juſtified before, and united to Chriſt by a precedent act of faith.</p>
                  <p>If therefore a Chriſtian ſhould not come into Gods preſence, or lay hold on a promiſe, till he have this Aſſurance of his inward qualifications, he may be debarred all his life; and the truth is, the ſoul in time of ſtraights, is like <hi>Eſther</hi> to go into the Kings preſence though it perceive not the Scepter held out. We muſt not be aſſured and then lay hold upon Chriſt, but by laying hold on Chriſt we come to be aſſured: Chriſt many times doth that for a godly man, which in another caſe he ſaid to <hi>Peter, Thou knoweſt not yet what I do to thee, but thou ſhalt know.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have at large diſcuſſed the Doctrine and Uſefulneſſe of Signs, I ſhall now propound in ſo many diſtinct Sermons, ſeveral choice and ſelect Signs, by which you may know how it is with you in reference to God. For if the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens did ſo much admire that ſaying as an Oracle, <hi>Noſce teipſum,</hi> Know and be acquainted with thy own ſelf, when yet they had neither true eyes, nor light to diſcover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by, how much rather doth this duty lie upon us, when by Gods grace we may have the ſeeing eye, and a ſure light of Gods Word to guide us therein? And the firſt Sign ſhall be, <hi>An uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal reſpect unto, and obſervation of Gods Commandments,</hi> out of the words read unto you, whereof the coherence is as followeth, The Apoſtle in the verſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, having comforted the children of God againſt their daily ſins of infirmity, which cannot be avoided, he returneth again to his ſcope, which is to preſſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe of life; and certainly our faith ought to be as buſie in embracing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts for holineſſe, as the promiſes for comfort. The Argument for ſanctity preſſed by the Apoſtle, is from the profitable effect thereof, it will be a ſure and comfortable ſign to confirm us that we are in Chriſt: for to know God, to love him, to be in him, to dwell in him, to have Communion with him, are all one with this Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>So that in the words you have two Propoſitions,</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>Firſt, That the knowledge of God makes us to keep Gods Commandments.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, That this obſervation of Gods Commandments is a ſign by way of an effect, to aſſure us that we know God, which is the cauſe.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>In the firſt Propoſition you have the Antecedent and the Conſequent. The Antecedent is knowing of God; howſoever according to the Hebrew rule this
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:30767:44"/>
word <hi>Knowing</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Affectus &amp; effectus conſequentes:</hi> the affections and effects flowing from it, and ſo includeth love of God, and the like; yet it doth more properly ſignifie faith, according to that, <hi>This is eternal life, to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent;</hi> for faith having ſeveral acts, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, aſſent, fiducial application, the Scripture doth by a <hi>Synecdocke</hi> expreſſe the whole nature of faith by one act of it. Now becauſe there is a three-fold know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <note place="margin">A three-fold Knowledge.</note> The firſt perfect, which is only in Heaven; The ſecond imperfect, but true and ſaving, which the godly only have; Hence Regeneration, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. is expreſſed by this, <hi>They ſhall all know God, and be mught of God:</hi> A third knowledge which is imperfect and inſincere, is that common gift of Gods Spirit upon temporary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, whereby though they know the ſenſe and meaning of divine truths, yet have not the ſaving effect and power of them upon their hearts, in which ſenſe our Saviour making that open confeſſion, and celebrating Gods power and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, ſaith, <hi>The things of God were hidden from the wiſe and prudent,</hi> Matth. 11. 25, 26. That is, the Scribes, Prieſts and Phariſees, who though very intelligent of the meaning of the Scripture, yet having not their eyes in a gracious manner en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned, therefore had thoſe divine things hid from them. A notable thing it is, and worthy all your conſideration, and trembling at it, that the very things you know in Religion by parts and abilities, may yet be hid from you, in reſpect of any ſaving knowledge; Therefore to declare what kinde of Knowledge this is, obſerve the conſequent, it is that which is operative and quickens us up to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God; for that proper and ſpecifical difference, whereby ſaving faith is diſtinguiſhed from the hypocrites, is in the cleanſing and purifying nature of it, whereby it <hi>works by love;</hi> ſo that love is not the form of true faith, but to be operative and effective of love. Now according to the three-fold knowledge ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, <hi>Zanchy</hi> doth well obſerve, there is a three-fold keeping of the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; <note place="margin">A three-fold keeping the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> for as our knowledge is, ſo is our holineſſe. The firſt is, <hi>Perfect and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat,</hi> as Chriſt did, and the Saints in heaven do perfectly love God. The ſecond is <hi>imperfect, but ſincere,</hi> though the Scripture cals it perfect, becauſe of the eſſential perfection, though it hath not a gradual. The third is <hi>external, with ſome internal affections, but altogether unſound.</hi> The Apoſtle as he meaneth the ſecond kinde of knowledge, ſo the ſecond kinde of obſervance of the Commandments, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the tranſlation be in the preſent tenſe, <hi>We know that we know him,</hi> yet in the original it is, <hi>We have known him,</hi> whereby it's plain, That good works doe not go before Faith or Juſtification, but follow it. The ſecond Propoſition is, that the keeping of Gods Commandments is a ſign that we do know him, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, by which he doth not mean a conjectural knowledge, as the Papiſts would put it off, but a ſure and certain knowledge. Now although the Apoſtle ſpeaks indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely, when he ſaith, <hi>Keeping the Commandments of God,</hi> yet becauſe it is in a neceſſary matter, the Aſſertion is equivalent to an univerſal.</p>
                  <p>Hence the Doctrine is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That an univerſal respect to, and keeping of Gods Commandments, is a ſure ſigne</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Obedience to God a ſign of Grace.</note> 
                     <hi>and infallible of our being in the ſtate of Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 22. he makes this to aſſure us in our prayer, becauſe we keep his Commandment, and do that which is well-pleaſing in his ſight.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrine is to be opened in many particulars:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There are ſome conſiderations in which it is impoſſible to keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments <note place="margin">Wherein it is impoſſible to keep Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> of God, not <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>inſe,</hi> as it is for a man to flie, for ſo it would be blaſphemy to ſay, He commands impoſſible things, to do ſo cannot ſtand with his Juſtice, Wiſdom and holineſſe: but only it's impoſſible by accident through our corruption, who as the Saints in heaven have <hi>Felix neceſſitas,</hi> as <hi>Auguſtin</hi> called it an happy neceſſity of obeying God alway, ſo have we <hi>infelix neceſſitas</hi> an unhappy neceſſity of diſobedience continually. Now this impoſſibility is two wayes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>In respect of every unregenerate man,</hi> who is dead in ſinne, not ſick or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, but dead in ſinne, and God juſtly doth require of us under pain of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:30767:44"/>
to obey his Law, though we have loſt the power. Neither is this as the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi> ſay, as if a Judge ſhould ſentence a mans eyes to be put out for a former fault, and then afterwards hang him, becauſe he cannot ſee, for it lieth not as a mortal duty upon a man to ſee; nor hath any Magiſtrate ſuch ſupream power over a man, as God hath over us. And by theſe commands of God is demonſtrated our duty only, not our ability: hence God makes it his Promiſe, <hi>To give us a new heart, and to make us to walk in all his ſtatutes;</hi> and although <hi>Arminians</hi> think it an abſurdity to make the ſame thing <hi>Requiſitum</hi> and <hi>Promiſſum,</hi> a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on required and yet a gift promiſed; there is nothing more ordinary in Scripture.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond impoſſibility of keeping the Commandments is, <hi>In reſpect of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>to whom God giveth not ſuch a meaſure of grace, as that they are able to keep them according to the perfect obligation of it.</hi> Rom. 8. 3, 4. We keep Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments in truth, not in perfection, not but that God is able to give us perfect grace, but he hath thought good to exalt imputed righteouſneſſe, rather then inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in this life.</p>
                  <p>A third impoſſibility of keeping the Commandments of God, is not only <hi>Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> that we are not able to keep them all, but fail in ſome, but <hi>diſtributively,</hi> there being not one Commandment we are at any time able to keep in any duty perfectly. And although it be eaſier to bring Arguments to prove we ſin ſometimes, and do not keep all the Commandments we ſhould, then to prove we ſin in every good duty, yet <hi>Rom. 7. 19. Gal.</hi> 5. 17. do ſtrongly confirm, that becauſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate corruption ſtill abiding in us, we are not able to do any thing ſo perfectly as the Law requireth: in the moſt holy men there are both <hi>Defectus privantes,</hi> and <hi>Affectus obſtantes,</hi> defects depriving us of the inward purity that ought to be in us, and affections contrarily withſtanding the obligation of the Law.</p>
                  <p>In the next place we will ſhew the poſſibility of it, and that is, firſt, <hi>By a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">How it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to keep the Law. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>inchoate Obedience,</hi> whereby we know God in part, love him in part, though not to ſuch a full degree. This is affirmed of the godly, therefore it is poſſible, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 6. Thus <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> are ſaid to be <hi>Righteous before God, walking in all his Commandments. David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal. 119. He ſhall not be confounded when he hath respect to all his Commandments.</hi> As the people of God have done this, ſo God hath promiſed this, <hi>I will circumciſe their hearts to love me with all their heart and min<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>.</hi> So <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. and this is the univerſal keeping of Gods Commandments ſpoken of in the Text, and much preſſed in ſeveral places; for there is the truth of all Obedience, though not the gradual perfection. It is no wonder that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God are ſaid to keep the Law of God, ſeeing they endeavour after it, and it's uſual in <hi>Philoſophy</hi> to call motions from the <hi>terminus</hi> to which they tend: Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is the <hi>writing of the Law in their inward parts,</hi> whereby the Law is not a burden, but pleaſing and matter of delight to them, as <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth it was to him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. And by this means the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We do not aboliſh the Law, but eſtabliſh it,</hi> becauſe the grace of God giveth ſuch ability and ſtrength, that in ſome meaſure we are able to obey it: So that the act of Faith <hi>ad intra,</hi> which is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of Chriſt, muſt not be oppoſed to, but conjoyned with that act of faith <hi>ad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra,</hi> whereby we walk in all the Commandments of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The Poſſibility of keeping them is in an evangelical ſenſe,</hi> that is, when <note place="margin">2.</note> whatſoever we fail in, is pardoned unto us, for ſo it is through the Covenant of grace, that when we have ſincerely applied our ſelves to the obedience of the whole Law, and falling ſhort of our duty in many reſpects. God through Chriſt doth forgive us, and ſo our righteouſneſſe conſiſts more in the remiſſion of what is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, then in doing what is perfect. In this ſenſe <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3, 4. Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to come in the fleſh, that the righteouſneſſe of the Law may be fulfilled in us:</hi> and <hi>Rom. 10. Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſſe to the believer,</hi> not to the worker, ſo that in all exerciſes of ſanctification we are to have a greater reſpect to what God doth forgive, then what we do, which hath made ſome ſay, Our perfection is to acknowledge our imperfection.</p>

Thirdly, <hi>We may be ſaid to fulfill the Law, when although through daily infirmities we fail of the ſtrict obligation, yet we do not by any groſſe ſin break it.</hi> In this ſenſe <note place="margin">3.</note> we keep it <hi>ſine crimine,</hi> though not <hi>ſine vitio,</hi> as <hi>Augustine</hi> ſometimes, that is, without a crime, though not without ſin. And although they are but few that do ſo, yet ſometimes God gives ſome of his children to walk in ſuch harmleſſe and ſpotleſſe lives. Thus <hi>Luk. 1. 6. Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth</hi> are ſaid to <hi>be blameleſſe. Phil.</hi> 2. 15. That ye may be <hi>blameleſſe and harmleſſe, the ſons of God in the midſt of a crooked generatiou:</hi> So it's required in a <hi>Biſhop that he be blameleſſe,</hi> that is, not without ſinne, but without crime, for which he may juſtly be cenſured, in which ſenſe the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. praieth, that the <hi>Corinthians may do no evil,</hi> that is, no ſuch crime, for which the Apoſtle ſhould inflict a Church-cenſure, as formerly we aſſerted. Thus you have heard in what ſenſe we are ſaid to keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the former and the later being pertinent to our ſcope.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, let us conſider how it is a ſign, for even when ſigns are agreed on, yet there may be much deceit about the explication of the ſign, cutting it too ſhort, or ſtretching it out too long.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in the firſt place, <hi>This univerſal obſervance is ſeen, when our Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">How obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Gods Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is a ſign of grace. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>is internal and ſpiritual as well as external.</hi> Could a man anſwer all the affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative and negative precepts in the outward converſation, yet if not ſpiritual in all theſe, they were as a body without a ſoul. And herein the Phariſees hypocriſie was diſcovered, they reſted wholly upon the outward obedience of the Law, when their hearts were <hi>Dens of thieviſh luſts;</hi> Hence our Saviour did ſo often preſſe them to make clean and waſh the inward man: <hi>The Law is ſpiritual,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>ſeeking them that worſhip in spirit and truth.</hi> Hence <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. our Saviour ſpends many words to convince the Phariſees that they were horrible violaters of Gods Law, wretched <hi>Adulterers</hi> and <hi>Murderers,</hi> though guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of no ſuch outward crimes. Oh what a piercing and diſcovering ſigne muſt this be. This makes the moral, yea and religious man, whoſe piety is only in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward exerciſes of grace, to be without any hope. Alas all theſe externals are nothing if there be not an inward ſpiritual rectitude of the whole man. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, <hi>Rom. 7. I delight in the Law of God, in the inward man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Antinomian</hi> pleads, <hi>That this univerſal Obedience cannot be a ſign of grace, becauſe</hi> Paul <hi>while unregenerated performed it, as appeareth</hi> Act. 13. 1. Act. 24. 16. <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                     <hi>where</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith,</hi> He lived with a good conſcience void of offence both towards God and man; <hi>Here (ſay they)</hi> Paul <hi>lived in an univerſal Obedience unblameably, and kept entirely to his conſcience, yet was not in Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to anſwer this, A good conſcience may be called good in a two-fold reſpect, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> A diſtinction about a good conſcience.</note> either when a man liveth not againſt the dictates of his conſcience, or doth any thing againſt that as thoſe Chriſtians did, whom <hi>Paul</hi> compelled through fear of death to blaſpheme: and thus <hi>Paul</hi> had a good conſcience, becauſe he verily thought he was bound to do as he did: in this ſenſe a Papiſt, a Jew, any Heretick may be ſaid to have a good conſcience. Or elſe a conſcience is ſaid good, when renewed by Gods Spirit, and rightly informed and regulated by Gods word; and thus <hi>Paul</hi> had a very evil conſcience, in which reſpect he called himſelf a <hi>Perſecutor,</hi> and <hi>the greatest of all ſinners,</hi> and ſo by the way you may ſee it's no argument of comfort for thoſe who broach any damnable hereſies, to excuſe the matter, ſaying, Are they not conſcientious men? Are they not to be pitied rather then puniſhed? Is it not according to their light? All this might have been ſaid for <hi>Paul,</hi> yet for all this his conſcience was a very evil and wicked conſcience, partly becauſe it was not renewed, partly becauſe it was not informed out of Gods word.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though <hi>Paul</hi> walked with a <hi>good Conſcience, and that towards God as well as man,</hi> yet that was for externals only, he was not acquainted with all the ſinfull motions of his heart, how much diffidence, ignorance, lukewarmneſſe, love to the world, his credit and glory was in him more then of God, he did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. Now Gods Law requireth that internal good frame above all. That <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <pb n="65" facs="tcp:30767:45"/>
was thus at that time, appeareth evidently <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. where the Apoſtle mentioning that former time of his life, ſaid, <hi>He knew not luſt to be ſinne till the Law ſaid thus againſt it, and that he was alive till then,</hi> had good confidence and perſwaſion in himſelf, but afterwards <hi>he died,</hi> he was quite out of love with himſelf, and loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed all that was in him: ſo that by this you ſee, how unblameable ſoever his liſe appeared, yet it was farre from being in a right way. Oh therefore be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to conſider your ſelves you that live unblameable lives, diligent in the duties that relate to God and man, though thy outſide be thus painted, thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards may be a noiſome ſepulchre! how uncomely is it for a man to have his porch and out-rooms very clean, but his chambers and in-rooms full of noiſome filth? This is thy caſe, look in thy life, no irreligion or impiety to God, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice or oppreſſion to men, yet thou art deſtitute of the Spirit, and void of all ſupernatural life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As our obedience muſt be thus internal, as well as external; ſo it muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <note place="margin">2.</note> as well as internal; We muſt not pleaſe our ſelves with contemplative Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations or pretended Revelations, neglecting an active induſtrious life for God in our places and relations. In Popery there is the contemplative life, and the active life; the one they compare to <hi>Mary,</hi> the other to <hi>Martha;</hi> and they ſay, that contemplative life, like <hi>Mary hath choſen the better part,</hi> but this is <hi>to hide our talents in a napkin;</hi> and as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſpeaks of ſome men, That they were <hi>Solâ ſocordiâ innocentes,</hi> becauſe of their ſloathfulneſſe, they did not come in harms<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, as others did. It was not wiſdom or juſtice, but meer ſluggiſhneſſe kept them from medling in dangerous matters; ſo we may ſay theſe are <hi>Solâ ſocordiâ pii,</hi> godly only by ſloathfulneſſe; To theſe we may adde ſome that pretend now adaies to live upon immediate Revelation, crying down all the Ordinances, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, Sacraments and Sabbath, as empty forms: But how doth this ſtand with that univerſall Obedience unto all the injunctions of God made to his Church?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Univerſal Obedience is a ſign when it doth carry us out equally to the duties of</hi>

                     <hi>the firſt table concerning God, and the ſecond our neighbour.</hi> To pretend much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion in matters of God, and to ſhew no conſcience or equity in matters with man, is horrible hypocriſie. The Phariſees were notorious in this, who had their <hi>long prayers,</hi> and yet <hi>devoured widows houſes,</hi> who taught that neither fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or mother might be relieved by their children of any thing they had, if it were <hi>Corban,</hi> that is, <hi>a gift conſecrated to God.</hi> Thoſe that are skilfull in the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh cuſtoms tell us, That the Phariſees taught any man might vow the goods he hath to God, abſolutely, or only in reſpect of this or that ſingular perſon, ſo that he ſhall have no benefit by it, and then when this vow was made they thought they might relieve no body, no though their Parents, and that in extream neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; but notwithſtanding all this ſeeming Religion to God, how corrupt and carnal in their carriages to men? <hi>Fides eſt copulativa,</hi> and ſo muſt our Obedience be <hi>copulative.</hi> Thy Religion to God is no ſign of grace, if there be unconſciona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dealing towards men. Again, if thou beeſt carefull in duties to men, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in the religious ſervice of God, hence thy rottenneſſe of heart is manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, thou doſt with all thy heart love a civil, juſt and righteous man, but thou canſt not abide a forward religious man, thou loveſt not ſtrict keeping of the Sabbath, diligent and powerful Family-duties, Oh, what little hope is here of true grace in ſuch a mans heart! It is ordinary with Scripture to deſcribe all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Piety by one duty ſometimes, and ſometimes by another, ſometimes by praying to God, ſometimes by keeping his Sabbaths, ſometimes by fearing of an oath, becauſe where one duty is graciouſly performed, there all the others will be alſo.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Univerſal Obedience is a ſign, when we are carried thereby to receive the</hi> Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denda, <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>as well as the</hi> Agenda, <hi>the things to be believed, as well as to be practiſed.</hi> Hence it's called, <hi>The obedience of faith;</hi> and this Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 23. divideth the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:30767:46"/>
Commandments of God in two parts, 1. Thoſe things that concern faith in Chriſt. 2. Thoſe things that relate to our love of others; therefore Gods Commandments muſt not only be limited to the prohibition of wicked lives, but muſt alſo be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to falſe doctrines; therefore obſerve the Apoſtles in all their Epiſtles, they are as vehement and zealous againſt falſe teachers, as wicked livers, and therefore preſſe with an equal neceſſity true faith, and a good conſcience; Therefore thy heart is then ſincere, when its ſet againſt hereſies, as well as prophaneneſs, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs as well as hereſies: If you have a man hot and vehement againſt ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, but indifferent about falſe doctrines, that man may juſtly ſuſpect his heart. Again, if a man cry out of hereſies and the tolleration of them, yet can abide pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, can tolerate that in his family, or elſe where, this man alſo ought to fear himſelf. Whatſoever the Scripture ſpeaks of impiety as deſtructive to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the ſame it alſo applieth to falſe doctrine. Is that the fruit or work of the fleſh? ſo are hereſies: Is that damnable? ſo are hereſies: Is that to be caſt out of the Church? ſo is falſe doctrine: Are wicked men <hi>prepared of old to deſtruction?</hi> ſo are falſe doctors: Are the ſheep of Chriſt meek and innocent in their converſation? ſo they will <hi>flee from a ſtranger, and not hear the voice of a ſtranger.</hi> So that if thou wouldſt try thy ſincerity, mark whether thou deſireſt more liberty in matters of faith, then in matters of life. No doctrine revealed in Scripture to be believed, may be any more diſpenſed with, then the precepts declared in Gods word for practice.</p>

                     <hi>particulars of relation,</hi> not as a Chriſtian abſolutely only, but as a Magiſtrate, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, Husband, Wife, Childe or Servant; if a man diſcharge not the commands of theſe Relations, though his general converſation as a Chriſtian be never ſo admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, yet he hath cauſe to ſuſpect himſelf; relative and domeſtical graces do more demonſtrate piety and true godlineſs then publick, general duties; for a mans pride, ſelf-ends, may put him upon theſe, as we ſee in the Phariſees, according to that rule, <hi>Ambitio ſcenam deſiderat,</hi> but it argueth truth of grace, to be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in fulfilling of thoſe relations we are ingaged in. Hence it is obſervable, how diligent the Apoſtle is in the cloſe of his Epiſtles to declare the duties of relations, and to be large in the motives for them.</p>
                  <p>The Uſe is of Exhortation, to judge your ſelves by this ſign.

Oh then how few are they, who may claim a right to grace! Many men have an external Obedience only, and no internal, but moſt have a partial and not entire compleat Obedience, therefore it is, <hi>That many are called and few are choſen.</hi> Conſider that terrible expreſſion of <hi>James,</hi> Jam. 2. 10, 11. where the Apoſtle informeth believers, that if they be guilty but of that one ſin, <hi>viz. Accepting of perſons, they are tranſgreſſors of the Law</hi> in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, which he further urgeth by this Aſſertion, <hi>He that keepeth all, and offends in one, is guilty of all,</hi> not diſtributively with a guilt of every particular ſinne, but in reſpect of the authority of the Law-giver, and the obligation of the Law, according to that, <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in every thing commanded by the Law;</hi> ſeeing therefore God in regeneration doth <hi>write his Law in our hearts,</hi> which doth ſeminally contain the exerciſe of all holy actions; ſo that there cannot be an inſtance of any godly duty, of which God doth not infuſe a principle in us; and ſeeing that glorification will be univerſal of ſoul and body, in all parts and faculties, how neceſſary is it that Sanctification ſhould be univerſal. Take heed therefore that the works of grace in thee be not abortive, or monſtrous, wanting eſſentiall and neceſſary parts. Let not thy ſhip be drowned by any one leak, dwell upon this, univerſality is a ſure rule of ſincerity.</p>

                  <p n="2">2. It's uncomfortable, becauſe it putteth a man upon the ſearching and finding out that which is impoſſible, for how canſt thou ever come to know whether thou couldeſt be content to love God and ſerve him, if there were no heaven? Thou maiſt make metaphyſicall abſtractions about theſe things, but there can never be any reall ſeparation of one from the other, and therefore it is impoſſible to know what thy heart would do in ſuch caſes. It is true, <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 9. uſeth an hyper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall expreſſion, I could wiſh to be an <hi>Anathema for my brethrens</hi> ſake, that is, to be ſeparated from Chriſt, and all communion with his priviledges, that ſo the Jews might be ſaved, for the ſaving of all them might ſeem to make more for Gods glory then the ſalvation of one man; but the Apoſtle ſpeaks not abſolutely <hi>I do wiſh,</hi> but <hi>I could wiſh,</hi> viz. if it were poſſible, or if it were lawfull; and in this he doth declare the vehemency of his love toward them.

Their Duty is to avoid ſin, which is preſſed from ſeveral Arguments;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the native filthineſs of it, <hi>It is a tranſgreſſion of the Law.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. From a collation or compariſon between the two Fountains or Fathers of him that doth <hi>ſinne,</hi> or him that doth <hi>righteouſneſſe;</hi> the one is of the <hi>Devil,</hi> the other <hi>is born of God;</hi> and this difference my Text amplifieth: So that in the words you read, you may obſerve five Propoſitions; firſt, <hi>He that is born of God ſinneth not;</hi> what it is to be born of God is eaſily known, <hi>viz.</hi> to have the image and holineſs of God ſtampt upon us by his Spirit quickning of us; we muſt not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine any communicating of the Divine Eſſence to us; in which ſenſe the <hi>ſecond Perſon is born of the Father,</hi> and ſo called, <hi>The Sonne of God;</hi> but by participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe ſupernaturall graces which make us reſemble him; The greater doubt is about the predicate, <hi>He ſinneth not;</hi> which hath much exerciſed the thoughts of men: ſome underſtand it of a perfection attained to in this life, not to ſin at all. Thus <hi>Papiſts, Pelagians,</hi> ſome <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> and divers of late; but if this were the meaning, the Apoſtle within a very little ſpace would expreſly contradict himſelf, for <hi>Chap.</hi> 1. 8, 10. he ſaith expreſly, <hi>If we ſay we have no ſinne we deceive our ſelves, and make God a liar.</hi> Not to ſin therefore is not wholly to be without ſinne. Others limit it to a certain kinde of ſinne, in this ſenſe, <hi>He ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not,</hi> viz. <hi>unto death,</hi> ſo that he ſhall be damned; and without queſtion to this purpoſe the Apoſtle ſpeaketh <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 16, 17, 18. But this ſeemeth to ſtraiten it too much. Others, as <hi>Arminians, he ſinneth not, viz.</hi> in this reſpect, and ſo farre as he is born of God; but what an abſurd ſenſe would this be, and who knoweth not that a godly man doth not ſinne in that he is godly, or becauſe he
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:30767:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is born of God. The moſt genuine and unforced interpretation therefore is, to underſtand it not univerſally, but according to the ſubject matter, <hi>he ſinneth not, as one who is of the Devil his father,</hi> he ſinneth not <hi>as Cain,</hi> all within him is not corrupted; ſo that he makes ſinne his trade, his cuſtom and delight. The very oppoſition makes this the meaning, I do not ground this oppoſition upon the phraſe <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as if that did alwaies ſignifie more then <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, for I grant that that phraſe ſometimes ſignifieth no more then barely to ſin, not de noting cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom or delight, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>But my foundation is upon the context, the oppoſition <hi>Paul</hi> makes between a righteous and unrighteous man, in reſpect of the roots whence they are, and then from the ſecond Propoſition, which is the reaſon why he ſinneth not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>the ſeed abideth in him,</hi> by which metaphorically is meant the principle of grace wrought in him by the Spirit of God, and that not only ſo, for <hi>Adam</hi> had the ſeed of grace, yet ſinned it away, but becauſe its preſerved by the Covenant of grace. This place is brought to prove perſeverance in grace, and no ſtrength of wit hath yet been able to overcome it. The third Propoſition is higher then the former, for it doth not only deny the act of ſin, but the power of it. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he ſin, <hi>viz.</hi> in the ſenſe before explained; and the fourth Propoſition is a ground of the third, <hi>becauſe he is born of God.</hi> Some make this reaſon the ſame with the former, but there ſeemeth to be this difference, the one ſignifieth that inward permanent principle of grace: The other that divine reſemblance of God which is in us by this regeneration. The firſt Propoſition is, <hi>That this difference between the righteous and unrighteous about ſinne is a ſure ſign, whereby the godly man is manifeſted both to himſelf and others that he is godly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That an oppoſition againſt and abſtinence from ſin is a ſure ſign, by which a man may</hi>

                     <hi>be perſwaded that he is in the ſtate of Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For there can be no better ſign to diſcover principles by, then their proper incommunicable actions; thus we diſcover fire by burning, a rational life by ſpeaking, now of all actions, this is moſt connatural to the permanent habit of grace to encline us to loath and abhorre thoſe things that are deſtructive to the nature of it, which is only ſinne: but becauſe we may eaſily be deceived about this ſign, for every one that is afraid of ſin, yea bitterly crieth out of it, and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth it, is not yet regenerated. Therefore let us diligently conſider how it is a ſign. And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>It is a ſign, When we perceive a ſetled fixed frame of heart againſt ſin.</hi> As <note place="margin">How it is a ſign. 1.</note> the reaſon in the Text implieth; The ſeed of grace abideth in a man, <hi>he is born of God,</hi> now theſe expreſſions do denote ſomething in us by way of a new nature, whereby we have an enmity and hoſtility, yea and irreconcilableneſs with ſinne; As ſome creatures have an antipathy againſt others; As on the contrary, he that is of the Devil, and ſo hath a fixed root of ungodlineſſe in him, he hath a conſtant enmity and hatred againſt godlineſs, and thoſe that are godly, Why ſo? <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their works are good,</hi> and his are <hi>evil,</hi> as <hi>John</hi> expreſſeth it; on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the godly cannot agree and delight in evil, or evil men, <hi>becauſe their works are evil,</hi> and his <hi>good;</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. cals it <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, hating ſin as hell it ſelf, and the exhortation is to caſt away their tranſgreſſions, <hi>abj<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>icere</hi> not <hi>deponere,</hi> becauſe of the loathſomneſſe they ſee in ſin; So then, let <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> let the <hi>Iſrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> in ſeveral calamities bewail their Idolatries, and ſins againſt God, yet here is no ſign of grace, becauſe their hearts were not ſtedfaſt within them. Theſe were ſudden tranſient motions not permanent principles, if thou wouldſt take com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from this ſign, do not judge of thy ſelf by ſome fits or ſeaſons, but by the habitual inclination of thy ſoul. God in regeneration doth firſt change our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, new mould us; and from this ſupernatural principle iſſue gracious actions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Then is this a ſign, When there is an univerſal repugnancy in every part</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>of a man againſt ſin, not only in his reaſon and conſcience, but in his will, affections and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:30767:50"/>
whole man.</hi> For this ſeed of grace is nothing, but Regeneration diffuſing it ſelf into the underſtanding, will and affections of the whole ſoul; ſo that in every part there is that which is regenerate and purified, as well as that which is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and defiled. <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. giveth you a large inſtance of this in himſelf, <hi>He delighted in the Law of God in the inward man,</hi> There was the Law of his minde in him (which was the ſeed of grace diffuſed through his whole ſoul) that did en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline him to every good thing commanded in the Law; ſo that although there was at the ſame time <hi>a law of the members, and the body of ſinne captivating of him,</hi> yet he had alſo a ſetled life of grace oppoſing all thoſe motions of ſinne; and this particular is diligently to be marked; There is many a man comforts himſelf in this, my heart is ſet againſt ſinne, and if I be overtaken at any time, my conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence checks me for it, and I condemn my ſelf, ſo that I ſay with <hi>Paul, The good I would not do that I do.</hi> Oh take heed thou do not deceive thy ſelf! for there is a vaſt difference between the check or reſiſtance of conſcience againſt thy corrupt affections and luſts, and between the oppoſition of the regenerate part in a man againſt the unregenerate; for the former is only between two particular faculties, the conſcience againſt the affections, but the later is univerſal, there is the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate part of the will and affections againſt the unregenerate part. So that in ſuch a caſe a Chriſtian doth not only ſay, my conſcience bids me do otherwiſe, I know better things, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> ſpeaks of his incontinent perſon, but he alſo ſaith, <hi>I will better things, I love and delight in better things.</hi> Oh therefore conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this ſign aright! when thy heart crieth out of ſinne, Oh thou wilt meddle with it no more! Is this oppoſition only from conſcience enlightned? Is it from that faculty only? Alas if ſo (as commonly it is no more) thou haſt no more ſign of grace in thee, then many Heathens have had. When a man is regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, not only his conſcience is made ſpiritual to diſcover the loathſomneſſe of ſin, but his heart alſo, his love, his delight, whereby he is carried out in all the power of his ſoul againſt ſinne; and if this be ſo, may we not cry out with the <hi>Pſalmiſt, Help Lord, for they are few that do truly hate ſin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>This is a ſign, As hereby it works in a man a difficulty, yea a kinde of an impoſſibility to ſinne with wilfulneſſe and purpoſed continuance. He doth not ſinne,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>neither can he ſinne,</hi> ſaith the Text. There being a root of grace in him, it's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible he ſhould ſinne with ſuch an univerſal content of ſoul, as wicked men do. There is a two-fold <hi>cannot,</hi> one <hi>moral,</hi> and is no more then that which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultly is not ſo. Thus 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 8 We cannot do any thing againſt the truth but for the truth.</hi> Act. 4. 10. <hi>We cannot but ſpeak the things we have heard and ſeen.</hi> And in this ſenſe, the children of God may be ſaid, They cannot ſinne, becauſe they have an averſneſſe of heart to it. Secondly, There is a <hi>cannot, abſolutely,</hi> ſo that the thing can never be, whether eaſily or difficultly, and in this ſenſe the godly man cannot ſinne totally and finally, ſo as to be wholly deſerted of God. As for the inſtance of <hi>Peter, David,</hi> and others, and whether the ſins of the godly may be called reigning ſins, I have already ſpoken to that matter. This is certain, it's impoſſible for a godly man ſo to delight and live in ſinne, as that the ſeed of grace ſhould be quite extinct. Although the grace that is in Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren may for a time make no actual reſiſtance, yet the principle of it by reaſon of Gods promiſe will never be fully removed out of the heart. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter, 1 Pet.</hi> 1. makes that new nature oppoſite to all earthly glory and greatneſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is corruptible and fading, but this abideth for ever. If therefore thou wouldſt have any comfort from this ſign, ſee how the ſeed of grace within thee, doth ſo affect and overpower thy heart, that thou canſt not ſin with willingneſſe, content, no nor commit the acts of groſſe ſins, <hi>How can I do this and ſinne againſt God?</hi> How can I? and by this means you have a palpable diſcovery of many amongſt us, not yet to be in the ſtate of grace; How can I lie, ſwear, deal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly, neglect Family-duties? Thou wouldſt finde ſuch a conſtraining and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling power of grace, that thou couldſt not do it: and mark if this impoſſibility
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:30767:50"/>
to ſinne ariſeth wholly from a kindly work of grace within, otherwiſe a wicked man cannot ſinne ſometimes, becauſe God puts a terrible reſtraint upon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; <hi>Balaam</hi> he could not ſinne in that wherein he was ſollicited, <hi>If thou wouldſt give me</hi> (ſaith he to <hi>Balaak) this houſe full of gold, I cannot curſe them, but muſt bleſſe thoſe whom God bleſſeth.</hi> God many times puts a bridle upon the conſcience of a wicked man, that he dareth not, nor cannot commit ſuch a ſinne, as his heart would carry him to, but this <hi>cannot ſinne,</hi> is farre dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from the godlies <hi>cannot ſinne;</hi> The one is a violent motion, the principle is from without, the other is a natural motion, and hath its ground from within it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>This is a ſign, in that hereby a godly man in ſome meaſure, and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>doth not only leave outward groſſe ſins, but even conquer and crucifie the inward body of ſinne.</hi> Gal. 5. <hi>He hath crucified the fleſh with the affections and luſts thereof;</hi> and he is ſaid <hi>to crucifie the body of ſinne, and the deeds of the fleſh;</hi> and herein this ſign is moſt eminently ſignificant; for a man cannot ſimply take comfort from this, he hath indeed once been ſuch and ſuch an ungodly ſinner, he hath wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſuch mire, but now he hath given over all thoſe courſes; a man (I ſay) cannot barely take comfort from this leaving of actual groſſe ſins, unleſſe there be a mortifying of them in the root, in the affections and motions thereunto; for <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of ſome, <hi>who had eſcaped the pollution of the world, and that through the knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> yet were Swines and Dogs in their nature. Wherein doth <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 7. ſo paſſionately bewail his captivity to ſinne, but only in reſpect of the inward motions thereof? Thus <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51. ſtaieth not upon his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and adultery, but goeth to that foul fountain, <hi>He was conceived in ſins,</hi> and intreats God <hi>to create in him a clean heart.</hi> If therefore thou would fain know whether thou art borne of God or no; See how pure and cleane thou deſireſt to make thy ſelf within, how doth the fountain of bloud within thee dry up?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>This is a ſign, When a mans oppoſition to ſinne, and leaving of it, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>of the foul nature of ſinne.</hi> It is contrary to God, it's <hi>a tranſgreſſion of his Law,</hi> and upon this ſpiritual motive he is bent againſt it. The Apoſtle (as you heard) giveth this as a reaſon, why the ſons of God ſhould not ſinne, becauſe <hi>ſinne is a tranſgreſſion of the Law;</hi> and <hi>David</hi> Pſal. 51. bewails his ſinne, though pardoned, becauſe God was offended thereby; ſo that though a man pour out flouds of tears for ſins, though his converſation outwardly become <hi>white as ſnow,</hi> yet this is no ſymptome of grace, a man can take no comfort from hence, unleſſe it be upon this ground, becauſe God is diſpleaſed, and his law broken: look over the Scriptures, you may ſee wonderfull examples of mens remorſe and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row about ſinne, yet thoſe very tears were ſo foul that they needed waſhing; Take <hi>Ahab,</hi> obſerve the Jews, conſider <hi>Judas,</hi> how were they caſt down about their ſinne? with what horrour of conſcience did <hi>Judas</hi> caſt away his thirty pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? Oh men may go very farre in ſorrow for ſinne, and in reforming of their lives about ſinne, and yet this be no ſign to them of the truth of grace. Why (you may ſay) what ſhould work upon them, if it be not grace? Oh there are many other motives that work upon them, terrors of conſcience, fear of Gods judgements, and the preſſing calamities that lie upon them! Inſomuch that true unfeigned hatred of ſinne is very rare; I deny not but the judgements of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a man ought to work in him a ſenſe and feeling of his ſins, a ſevere judging and condemning of himſelf under Gods hand. But to have this the only ground argueth not the preſence of grace in them. They are tied up from ſinne as Maſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

man viſible to others. The Phariſees who were free from outward wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet abounded with heart-defilements, as our Saviour chargeth them. But <hi>Paul</hi> doth deeply bemoan the evil motions of his heart, and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> humbled himſelf for <hi>the pride of his heart;</hi> That pride, unbelief, earthlineſſe, and ſeveral luſts of ſoul are diſcovered by him, and crucified, and we read of no hypocrite that went ſo farre. Again, There are ſins done in <hi>ſecret,</hi> which none, or few know, ſuch as theft, uncleanneſſe, unlawful trading, crafty policies: or <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,</hi> that are as it were upon the Theatre in the eyes of all: now the godly man abhorreth the former as well as the later, he dareth not commit a ſin in the eye of Almighty God, which is every where, he feareth Gods knowledge of it more then all the world.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>Sins are either of commiſſion, by a poſitive diſobedience unto the Law of God, or of omiſſion, by defect or neglect,</hi> ſuch are omiſſion of holy religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, neglect, lukewarmneſſe and diſtraction therein; now a gracious heart ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth not only groſſe ſins, but defects in holy Ordinances.

                  <p>Further, <hi>There are ſins againſt the moral Commandments of God, which are of good things intrinſecally ſo; and againſt poſitive commands, which are only good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe commanded.</hi> A ſanctified perſon feareth the ſinne againſt the one, as well as againſt the other; thus he feareth to prophane the Sabbath, to uſe any falſe worſhip, to come to the Sacrament in an unprepared manner, as well as to be unjuſt and oppreſſive.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>There are ſins that become endeared by cuſtome, education, complexion, by profit or pleaſures.</hi> Now notwithſtanding all theſe temptations, the godly man throweth them away like menſtruous cloth, yea the ſins they have been moſt enticed with, they manifeſt the greateſt zeal againſt, <hi>and deſire in all things to ſhew themſelves approved.</hi> Oh (Beloved) if theſe marks and ſigns be in you, then may your joy abound. Do not henceforth argue thus, He muſt needs be a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, for he hath ſuch revelations, ſuch enlargements in duties; he hath had ſuch experimental workings upon him, he is of ſuch opinions, for ſuch a Church-government.

But alas, where are the men? how few are they of whom this Text is true, <hi>They ſinne not, neither can they ſinne?</hi> The contrary is true, They love not that which is holy, neither can they, becauſe <hi>they are of the wicked one.

They thought not ſo, for they ſaid, <hi>They were of Abraham,</hi> but becauſe they expreſſed in their lives ſuch wickedneſſe as was in the devil. No doubt but many will take it ill to be ſaid, <hi>They are of the devil,</hi> but their actions demonſtrate it.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall conſider that ſign of his ſincerity, wherein he deſireth God would <hi>Try him, and ſearch him:</hi> So that if there were any Hypocriſie, any falſe way, any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound or imperfect principles he walked in, it was his hearty deſire to have all diſcovered. And certainly there cannot be a greater argument of the truth of Grace, then a willingneſs to come to the light, and a readineſs to be weighed in the balance; as on the other ſide you have not a ſurer character of an hypocrite, and an unſound Chriſtian, then fear of the light, and unwillingneſs to be ranſaked and ſearched into the very bowles by the word of God: But <hi>Davids</hi> hearty wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs in this particular appeareth, 1. In the ſeveral words he heaps up together in his Petition, <hi>Examine me;</hi> as Artificers doe, whether their gold be weight or no: <hi>try me</hi> by diſcovering whether I am inwardly ſound or no: <hi>Prove me,</hi> (as the word ſignifieth) as when the Artificer melteth his ſilver in the fire, that ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the droſs. 2. This doth appear in the object matter which he would have thus proved, and that is, <hi>His heart, his reins,</hi> which are the moſt inward and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret motions of his ſoul, he would have a deeper ſearching into, and winnow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him then the world can do. Certainly <hi>David</hi> in this Petition doth diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver great honeſty, and faithfulneſs of Spirit. Now, here may be two doubts. 1. How God can be ſaid to tempt, or try any man, ſeeing <hi>James 1. 13. God is ſaid to tempt no man;</hi> and the divel is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as if it were his work on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <note place="margin">There is a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble temptation.</note> The Anſwer is obvious, <hi>That there is a double Temptation:</hi> one evil, which is defective either in the principle, or means, or end of the Temptation. And thus the Divel and our own fleſh Tempt. The other is a good Temptation, ariſing from a good principle, in a lawful way, to a good end; and thus God doth Tempt, that is, doth make a diſcovery what is in man; not as if he were ignorant
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:30767:52"/>
of it, but that hereby the perſon truſted may be better known to himſelf, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, we may doubt how <hi>David</hi> could lawfully pray to be Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, ſeeing our Saviours rule is to pray, <hi>That God would not lead us (or caſt us,</hi> for <hi>ne infer as,</hi> doth better Anſwer <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> then <hi>ne inducas) into temptation;</hi> But that is to be underſtood of the evil of temptation: ſo as God ſhould withdraw his grace either, internal, ſubduing our corruptions, or external, repreſſing Satan and all outward power againſt us.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things thus explained, obſerve, <hi>That it is a ſure and comfortable ſign of grace, when a man is willing to have his ſoul and all within ſearched by God.</hi> That which here <hi>David</hi> prayeth for, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17. 3. he there acknowledgeth what God had done, <hi>Thou haſt proved my heart, thou hast tryed me, and haſt found nothing;</hi> which is not to be underſtood as if <hi>David</hi> had no Droſs in him, (for thoſe words are taken from the Artificers that melt their gold and ſilver) ſeeing <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. He cryeth out, <hi>Who can underſtand his errors: cleanſe me from ſecret ſins.</hi> But of total and univerſal hypocriſie; neither doth <hi>David</hi> ſpeak this arrogantly, as preſuming of himſelf, but takes comfort from this in his grievous troubles, as a teſtimony that he belongs to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Job</hi> alſo in his cala mities hath his face and heart anſwering <hi>Davids, Job 23. 10. When he hath tryed me, I ſhall come out like Gold;</hi> ſo that from hence we may ſee, that a love and willingneſs to have our hearts ſearched by God, is ſuch a teſtimony of the truth of Grace, that it is a great bulwark in times of ſad afflictions: It is therefore worth the enquiry into the nature of this ſign; for if the wiſeman ſaid even of theſe petty outward things, <hi>Falſe weights are an abomination unto the Lord,</hi> how much more abominable muſt thoſe falſe ballances be wherein men through blindneſs and ſelf flatterry weigh themſelves.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place. Let us conſider how God doth try, that ſo we may perceive <note place="margin">How many ways God tries men.</note> our willingneſs therein. And the firſt way is by his word, <hi>Eph. 5. 13. Whatſoever doth manifest, and ſo reprove evil, is light.</hi> Now the Scriptures are like the Sun, into which God put all light, and other things ſhine with light borrowed from thence. <hi>David</hi> commends Gods word <hi>for a light and lanthorn to his feet;</hi> and that by which he was forewarned from ſin; and for this profit coming by them, he commends them for preciouſneſs and ſweetneſs above <hi>fine Gold, and the hony combe:</hi> See here a true touchſtone of Grace; thou loveſt the word of God above any treaſures in the world, not onely for the promiſſary part of it, but the diſcovering part of it: It acquainteth thee with all the evil of thy heart, and thy wayes: It ſpeaks bitter things againſt pride, luſts, laſineſs, immoderate love of the world: It makes me an undone man; it will give me no comfort in any evil way, and therefore I can read it, and meditate on it with hearty delight, <hi>Heb. 4. The word of God is quick, and powerful, diſcerning the</hi> Intima, <hi>and the</hi> Minima, <hi>moſt deep things of man, and the leaſt ſins in him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As by the light of the Sun beams we ſee the little motes, and flyes in the air, ſo by Gods word ſhining into our hearts, we come to ſee many things ſinful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, which we did not perceive before: Oh then conſider your ſelves herein; do you love the word of God becauſe it finds out thy ſins, never ſpeaks any good to thy corrupt wayes? doſt thou pray, O Lord, let thy word ſtill enter with more light and power upon me? this is a comfortable ſign; but on the other ſide, if thou art in a continual fear of the light, dareſt not look into the Bible becauſe it ſpeaks againſt ſuch and ſuch ſins thou art guilty of, be afraid thou art not right. <hi>Tertullian</hi> called Hereticks <hi>Lucifugae Scripturarum,</hi> they were like Bats and Owls, they could not endure the light of the Sun: And our Saviour ſaith, <hi>The theif hates the light, becauſe his deeds are evil.</hi> Oh then take heed you who have a leproſie of ſin plainly appearing upon you: doth not the word of God meet thy drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thy luſts, thy oaths, thy pride, as a Bear robbed of her whelps: Oh thy ſoul muſt needs hate the word of God, becauſe it is ſo contrary to thee.</p>

A gracious heart loveth that Miniſtry which like the word of God is a two edged ſword in his heart, of which he can ſay as the woman, of Chriſt, <hi>It hath told me all that ever I did.</hi> That <hi>ſhaking of heaven and earth</hi> which the Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> ſpeaketh of, is the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles, and in the Hebrew is the word, from whence <hi>Bonarges</hi> cometh.

                     </gap>, when ye can look upon the ſun beams: when light is not offenſive to your ſore eyes. It was a ſpeech infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible betraying <hi>Ahabs</hi> rotten heart, when he ſaid of the Prophet <hi>Michaiah, I hate him, becauſe he alwaies speaks evil to me.</hi> You have juſt cauſe to ſuſpect the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your hearts, when you delight onely in a lazy, formal, general, and dull mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry: when you would have Prophets that ſhould ſing onely <hi>Pleaſant ſongs, daub with untempered morter;</hi> encourage you, notwithſtanding your ſins you are in. And if this be a ſymptome of an unſound heart, may we not ſay Hypocriſie hath fallen upon the hearts of moſt in <hi>England,</hi> who rejoyce not in thoſe Miniſters and Prophets that rouſe their conſciencies, that trouble them for their ſins, that would reform them from their ſuperſtitions and prophanies? do not the faithful Miniſters of God meet with the ſame hatred and oppoſition as the prophets did by <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem?</hi> and why is all this? That of our Saviour will anſwer it, <hi>The thief hates the light, becauſe his deeds are evil.</hi> Therefore is thy heart afraid, and unwilling to have a Miniſtry that ſhall diſcover thy ſins, becauſe thy Conſcience is full of Ulcers and ſores: whereas now if thou dideſt love to be reformed, how wouldeſt thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the light of the Miniſtry. The more ſpiritual, powerful, operative, thou dideſt finde it in thy heart, thou wouldeſt bleſs God the more: thou wouldeſt cry out with thankfulneſs, O Lord I bleſs thee that light ſhineth in every dark corner of my heart: Oh let it ſtill be a miniſtry, as if to me onely, to mind me of my ſins, to bring my iniquites to remembrance. O Lord, my heart doth not rage, nor riſe againſt this light; it doth not hate, or rebel againſt it, but I ſet open the Gates of my ſoul to receive more in.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>The work of Conſcience within us, that alſo doth prove us.</hi> God hath ſet up a light within us, and when this is enlightened by the word, then it makes a mans <note place="margin">3.</note> breſt full of light. Now a faithful godly man, he loveth this ſhould be tender, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, ſpeaking out of Gods word for every duty, and againſt every ſin. You ſee the quickneſs of it in <hi>David,</hi> when it's ſaid, <hi>His heart ſmote him:</hi> and 1 <hi>John 3. If thy heart condemn thee, God is greater then thy heart.</hi> Alas, if thou within thy own ſelf judgeſt thy ſelf to ſin thus and thus, God doth much more. Try thy integrity: art thou willing to have a tender conſcience, and an informed conſcience? Doſt thou love to hear what that ſpeaks out of Gods word? whether peace or Duty, this is comfortable. But on the other ſide, if thou art a man that rebeleſt againſt the light of it; wouldſt ſain put out the ſting of it; wouldſt be glad to feel no ſuch living thing in thy breaſt, then thou haſt cauſe to ſuſpect thy ſelf: Oh it is to be feared that there are many that give themſelves to luſts, and carnal pleaſures, that ſo they may put a foggy miſt between this ſin and them. Others digg into the world, labouring to become ſenceleſs, that ſo there may be an eclipſe of this light by the interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the earth. Others run to damnable Hereſies, denying Scriptures, God, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Hell; pleading for an univerſal ſalvation of all: What are theſe but refuges of guilty conſciences. It is true, we muſt diſtinguiſh between our carnal concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and conſcience; between deluded imaginations, and conſcience; between an erronious, and ſcrupulous conſcience, and a well grounded, and truly informed conſcience; and when we have done ſo, we muſt follow conſcience as far as that follows the word.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>God tryeth us by the illuminations of his Spirit, and ſtrong convictions thereby.</hi>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:30767:53"/>
Thus God proveth us, and makes us to know what we are, and wherein we fail. <hi>John 16. The ſpirit of God convinceth of ſin, and of righteouſneſs;</hi> and we are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden <hi>to quench the ſpirit:</hi> a metaphor (as ſome ſay) from the fire in the Temple that was not to be put out. And again it is the character of the ſtiffnecked <hi>Jewes,</hi> as fitted for deſtruction, that they alwaies reſiſted the ſpirit of God. If therefore thou wouldeſt have comfort from this ſign, conſider how the illuminations and motions of Gods Spirit are cheriſhed, and nouriſhed by thee. <hi>As ſoon as the cock croweth, doest thou go out and weep bitterly?</hi> Is not the Spirit of God grieved, and imbittered by thee? Oh, though they be dear, and pleaſant, or profitable ſins, yet the Spirit of God convinceth thee of them, makes thee forſake them: and doeſt thou rejoyce under this work of Gods Spirit upon thee? Doeſt not thou reſiſt and riſe up againſt it? Oh, (beloved) deeply weigh this. Though it may be there are ſome ſo ſwiniſh and beaſtly, that the ſpirit of God never moveth or worketh in them: Yet there are others who are not yet forſaken by God, but in the miniſtrie he ſtands at the dore, and knocks; he beckens unto thee to come unto him. Oh, now is God proving thee, examining thee. Now is he trying thee, if truth be in thee thou wilt be glad in this work of God upon thee, and deſire ſtill more and more burning, and ſhining light within thee.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>God tryeth, when by his Providence we are put upon many duties and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, which it may be at other times did not concern us.</hi> Thus God examined <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> by a command to offer up his onely ſon <hi>Iſaak.</hi> Thus God tryed the young man, who had great confidence in himſelf, by that perſonal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <hi>to go and ſell all he had and to follow him.</hi> Now times of perſecution, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſuch times of tryal: Whether then we love <hi>Father or mother, houſes or chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or lives themſelves, better then him?</hi> Thus the ſecond kind of Ground, that had an hopeful ſprouting, was quickly diſcerned to have <hi>no root when the ſun aroſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The veſſels ſoundneſs is tryed in the fire: The Mariners skill in a ſtorm: The trees in a windy tempeſt. In winnowing all the chaff flyeth a way. There is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable place to the Godly, <hi>Zach. 13. 9. God promiſeth he will refine them as Gold by their afflictions,</hi> they ſhall only loſe their droſs.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>And this is the ſixt way of Tryal,</hi> viz. <hi>When God brings us under his chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> This manifeſteth what mettal we are of. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 7. The tryal of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by thoſe troubles, is ſaid to be <hi>more excellent then that of the gold in the fire,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is <hi>periſhing,</hi> and this <hi>abideth for ever.</hi> Hence afflictions are onely called <hi>Temptations,</hi> and not <hi>Mercies,</hi> though they many times diſcover what we are. Now indeed, we are not to pray to God that God would afflict us, that he would bring us into the fire; but when he doth it, we are to make this advantage, <hi>The Lord doth it to humble us, and try us, to ſee what is in our hearts;</hi> whether we will remain conſtant and faithful unto him: Therefore we do not deſpiſe the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, or murmur againſt God; but rejoyce that this purging of us, makes us to bring forth more fruit.</p>
                  <p>As God uſeth theſe ſeveral waies to prove us, and the ſoul of a Godly man is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <note place="margin">A godly man gives up him ſelf to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, proved, Eſpecially, 1.</note> herein, ſo in theſe three caſes eſpecially doth a Godly man give up himſelf to be examined.</p>

It is good to obſerve the excellent temperament of <hi>Paul, 1 Cor.</hi> 7. in determining that caſe of conſcience about marriage to the <hi>Corinthians:</hi> His expreſſions are, <hi>Yet not I, but the Lord; and I think I have the spirit of God.</hi> The ſame candor and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:30767:54"/>
doth he work in his children: If therefore a Godly man doth err any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous error, it is with him as in other ſins; he doth not flatter himſelf; his heart is apt to ſmite him. <hi>Errare poſſum Haereticus eſſe nolo,</hi> he will not be obſtinate; he is earneſt to have all things ſearched and tryed; whereas it is the nature of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie to maintain thoſe poſitions which are for profit, and ſelf-intereſt, againſt all light. Are not the Phariſees a ſad inſtance for this, who though they had no juſt ground to oppoſe our Saviour, yet becauſe Chriſts way was deſtructive to their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe and credit; when they could not fairly anſwer, they would fouly blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme: Whereupon our Saviour chargeth them with blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In matter of received worſhip, and traditional ſervice of God.</hi> Although it be worſhip that can plead cuſtom from preſcription many years, commendation of the univerſality of learned men; yet an heart truly ſincere, deſireth to have all things examined and proved out of Gods word: <hi>Chriſt ſaid he was truth,</hi> not cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, as the Father obſerved well; and Chriſt dyed not onely to deliver us from our ſinful waies, but the Tradition of our Fathers, <hi>John</hi> 4. You may obſerve the carnal diſpoſition of all men about an accuſtomed way in ſerving of God, in that woman of <hi>Samaria;</hi> ſhe preſſeth the argument that all ſilly and ignorant people do now for any Superſtition, <hi>Our fathers worſhipped,</hi> &amp;c. but our Saviour inſtructeth her of a <hi>Worſhipping God in ſpirit and truth,</hi> which ſhe before was wholy ignorant of. Therefore in this matter a man may diſcover much integrity of his heart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if any be thus affected, I care not what Scriptures you bring, I hearken not to what Arguments are fetched out of Gods word, it is plain this man carnally adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to his own imagination, and is not willing to be ſearched: As that Papiſt, <hi>Cornelius Maſſus</hi> ſaid, <hi>If a thouſand Austins and Chryſoſtomes ſaid thus and thus, he cared not, he would believe what the Pope ſaid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>This is eminently diſcovered in matter of practiſe.</hi> Although a man hath been addicted to ſinful waies of pleaſure, profit, or any advantage whatſoever, yet all thoſe things that he accounted gain, afterwards he will judge loſs for Chriſts ſake. <hi>Paul</hi> though much engaged in a way againſt Chriſtianitie, yet when once wrought upon, <hi>He conſulteth not with fleſh and blood, Gal.</hi> 1. He conſiders not any carnal reaſoning, but applieth immediately, and that without any limitation, to Gods commands, <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> (ſaith he:) He giveth up his heart as a blank, let God write down what he pleaſeth. Thus <hi>Elihu,</hi> ſuppoſing upon a falſe ground <hi>Job</hi> to be an Hypocrite, doth give him excellent counſel, <hi>Job 34. 31, 32. Surely it is meet to be ſaid unto God, I have born chaſtiſement, I will offend no more. That which I ſee not, teach thou me; and if I have done iniquity, I will do ſo no more.</hi> Therefore herein mayſt thou ſee the truth of thine heart: canſt thou heartily ſay, <hi>that which I ſee not, teach thou me,</hi> Neither profit, pleaſure, or any conſultation with fleſh and blood ſhall hinder me from my dutie. Whereas if you obſerve the half-converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of any to God, the Iſraelites, <hi>Jehu,</hi> many in the New Teſtament, you ſhall find they all flew back upon this ground, <hi>They conſulted with fleſh and blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next place let us conſider what are the effects of ſuch a gracious temper in the heart. And</p>

The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> repentance, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth their zeal, fear, and indignation, and revenge againſt them ſelves. See 1 <hi>Cor. 11. If we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged of the Lord.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Not reſting upon generals, but particularly applying matters of Duty.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> complaineth, no man ſaith? <hi>What have I done?</hi> The young man comforted himſelf well enough in the general, till our Saviour in particular tryed him, and then <hi>he went away ſorrowful:</hi> particular applications and diſcharge of duty, will try, as the jealouſie water did the ſuſpected woman. A man may ſpeak and preach for godlineſs in the general, but when it comes to particulars, he cannot
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:30767:54"/>
abide it. The Phariſees, they commended the Prophets that lived before them; but Chriſt, and thoſe that lived at that time who reproved them for their ſins, they could not abide. Therefore it is a good rule of the Ancient, <hi>When,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>you hear a man commending thoſe ancient doctors that went before:</hi> ſee how he is affected to his preſent Teachers. That oppoſition which wicked men ſhew to thoſe preſent men alive that diſcover God to them, they would do to <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul;</hi> to <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> if they were alive. But when a thing is general, or afar off, it doth not move at all: particular preſent things, do diſcover what men are, and a ſincere heart loveth thoſe beſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>A ſincere heart loveth a Godly reproof, and thoſe that give it.</hi> See it in <hi>David; Let the righteous ſmite me, and it ſhall be better then oyl:</hi> Whereas a man of a falſe and Hypocritical heart, he rageth and flyeth in the face of thoſe that reprove him, though it be done with all prudence and compaſſion. Therefore try how thou canſt bear a reproof. Doth it work Humilitie, Love, Reformation in thee? this is good.</p>
                  <p>To all this which hath been delivered, this caution muſt be remembred, which holdeth alſo in all other ſigns. We muſt not expect a punctual perfection herein, for even thoſe who are truely ſanctified, have yet diſcovered much falſhood and hypocriſie. Take <hi>David</hi> for an inſtance in that groſs guilfull way of the Murther of <hi>Uriah:</hi> could he then ſay, <hi>Examine mee, prove me?</hi> Was not there droſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be found in him? Therefore though <hi>David</hi> deſired ſuch an inward ſearching of him, yet that he had no confidence in himſelf, appeareth by that u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal principle he layeth down in another place: <hi>If thou (O Lord) be ſtrict to mark what is done amiſs, no fleſh ſhall be juſtified in thy ſight.</hi> Thus <hi>Aſa,</hi> though he was a godly man, yet when reproved by the Prophet for his ſin, how did corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtirre within him, in ſo much that he threw the good Prophet into priſon for doing his duty!</p>
                  <p>Uſe of Examination: Here is a touchſtone and trial for your ſelves. Is there love of the Light, or fear of the Light: are you afraid of the word of God, a ſoul-ſearching Miniſtrie, cloſe and particular applications? then ſuſpect all is not ſound within thee. But if thou rejoiceſt in that thy ſores are diſcovered, thou art glad when thy Hypocriſie is made known to thy ſelf, and thou crieſt out, More Light, Lord, more ſearching of my inward man, here is a good comfortable ſign. Hence <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 19. when he had ſaid, <hi>Who can underſtand his Errors?</hi> he prayeth, <hi>Cleanſe me from ſecret ſins.</hi> Doeſt thou ſo? Lord I fear much ſecret, and unknown cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in me: I know not how bad I am; a great deal of filthineſs lieth undiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in me; Oh let me be tried and proved by thee.</p>

                  <p>A Fifth ſign of the ſtate of grace, ſhall be <hi>growth and further progreſſe in ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,</hi> out of theſe words, which are a part of that valedictory or fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well Parable our Saviour ſpake to his Diſciples, encouraging them in their duty and conſolation: For in the former Chapter our Saviour having informed them of two particulars, which might juſtly trouble their hearts, whereof one was his departure from them, and the other the ſad calamities which would fall upon them: By this Parable he giveth a twofold remedy to that twofold grief. For the firſt, <hi>though he be corporally abſent, yet he is spiritually preſent,</hi> and that with a very near union, for he is the Vine and they the branches, ſo that ſpirituall efficacy ſhall alwaies be communicated to them. 2. For the latter, he exhorts them <hi>to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere and abide in him, notwithſtanding all perſecutions,</hi> from arguments <hi>ab effectu utili &amp; pernicioſo:</hi> This is the ſcope.</p>
                  <p>In the Parable you have firſt the ſimilitude laid down generally, <hi>I am the true Vine, and my Father the Husbandman.</hi> The true Vine <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, becauſe the properties of a naturall Vine to its naturall branch, are nothing in reſpect of what Chriſt is to his ſpirituall branches.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond verſe you have a diſtinction of two kinde of branches in Chriſt, which alſo doth inſinuate exhortation to look to our ſelves. The firſt kinde of branch is, <hi>that which is in him not bearing fruit.</hi> He doth not by this mean an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then or a flagitious wicked man, but an hypocrite that hath the viſibility of a branch but not the reality: he doth not ſay, Every briar or nettle that bringeth not forth fruit, but every branch; But how is an hypocrite in Chriſt? not by any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall union, but outward profeſſion, by the Sacraments, and in the judgement of others, he is in Chriſt, as a <hi>ſciens</hi> newly grafted on a tree, which yet hath no coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition with it, or receiveth any juyce or nouriſhment from it, and ſee that terrible judgement that impendeth this unprofitable branch: A nettle in the garden, weeds among corn, ill branches in a vine, are in the greater danger, and ſo is a Chriſtian in the Church, not inwardly participating of efficacy from Chriſt. In the firſt place he doth <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, take him away, which is more particularly amplified <hi>ver. 6. he is caſt forth of the vineyard,</hi> Chriſt bids them depart, then he withers, for though he had no fruit, yet he had leaves, and all this decaies; and laſtly, he is <hi>cast into the fire</hi> to be burnt. The other kinde of branch is that which being in Chriſt brings forth fruit, and concerning this obſerve the care and love of the vine-dreſſer, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>he purgeth it,</hi> for that is neceſſary for vine-branches: Therefore the Hebrew word for a branch or vine is called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, without or rather ſeparated from me: he doth not ſay, ſaith <hi>Auſtin, that ye can do no greater thing without me, but no thing,</hi> and he doth not ſay ye cannot <hi>perficere</hi> perfect, but <hi>facere,</hi> ye cannot do; which our Saviour doth not apply unto that generall aid of God that is needfull in all naturall and morall actions, but of the ſpeciall aſſiſtance of grace, whereby as branches we bring forth ſpirituall fruit, and obſerve that there is our abiding in Chriſt, and Chriſts abiding in us, and Chriſts immanency or indwelling in us, is properly the cauſe of ſpirituall fruit, not our dwelling in him; as the branch beareth fruit, not ſo much becauſe it is in the vine, as becauſe the vine is in it communicating juyce to it. Laſtly, <hi>This growth and fruitfulneſſe is spoken of as an abſolute property,</hi> in my Text: And <hi>verſ. 8. If ye bring forth fruit, ſo ſhall ye be my Diſciples;</hi> that is, this is a neceſſary property to demonſtrate that ye are indeed my Diſciples, and then our Saviour ſpeaks of it as a ſign, <hi>v. 11. Theſe things have I spoken, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full;</hi> now they could have no joy in theſe things, unleſſe they could know they did bring forth fruit, and therefore were Chriſts Diſciples.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That growth and encreaſe in grace is a neceſſary property and an infallible ſign of our</hi>

                     <hi>being in the ſtate of grace.</hi> Our Saviour ſaith not, <hi>Every branch in me,</hi> that is green and flouriſheth with leaves and bloſſomes, <hi>but that beareth fruit,</hi> he makes it to bring forth more fruit. It is not every Chriſtian that hath the flouriſhing green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and leaves of common abilities, and parts in religion, that is regarded by God, but that man whoſe talent of grace, <hi>as five, hath gained ten:</hi> Therefore in that Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable our Saviour bid them all negotiate, play the merchants, and trade in the waies of grace, and one man hath his portion among hypocrites, though he had not idlely ſpent his talent, but becauſe he had not improved, <hi>propter lucrum ceſſans,</hi> though not <hi>propter damnum emergens;</hi> ſo that the opening of this mark will be of great uſe, becauſe encreaſe of grace is ſo rare: and whereas all men endeavour to have their health, wealth and eſtates better, they are not carefull to have better gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to pray better, to hear better, to be more ſtrong in beleeving and heavenly-mindedneſſe. To affect you therefore herein, conſider firſt,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That as there is a neceſſity of being converted and tranſlated from ſinne to a ſtate of grace, ſo there is alſo a neceſſity when we are put therein, to grow and encreaſe to a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtature in holineſſe.</hi> Thus in the Text, <hi>Every branch he purgeth to bring more fruit,</hi> Eph. 4. 16. Col. 2. 19. In which places every godly man is ſaid to be knitted to Chriſt, and thereby partaketh of his ſpirit and nouriſhment, wherein he encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth with the encreaſe of God, that is, with a divine and ſpirituall encreaſe, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the naturall growth of the body: ſo that whoſoever findeth himſelf ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon his lees, continuing ſtill in the ſame formall, empty, barren way, he may juſtly ſuſpect whether he be of the body of Chriſt; but as the glaſſe eye and artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall leg receiveth no nouriſhment from the body, but have ſtill the ſame dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, is no longer or broader, ſo is every unregenerate man deſtitute of the vivifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call influence of Chriſts ſpirit, and therefore is the ſame without any change, he was many years ago. Yea, that the neceſſity of the growth of grace may appear, the Apoſtle <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 12, 13. makes it the great end of the Miniſtery, the end why God hath given <hi>Paſtors and Teachers to his Church,</hi> not only for converſion, but <hi>further edification, till we all come unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt:</hi> which is not to be underſtood in the life to come, but in this life, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the verſe following, that <hi>we be not hence forth like children carried with every winde of doctrine;</hi> ſo that God hath appointed a Miniſtery not only for lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:30767:56"/>
the foundation of godlineſſe in the peoples hearts, but for ſuperſtruction; and oh that the Miniſters of God could ſee this glorious effect. What haſt thou been more inſtructed in? wherein haſt thou been more quickned up to godlineſſe ſince thou haſt enjoyed the Miniſtery? Oh (beloved) if Chriſt ſhould come and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our perſons, families, may he not curſe us with the figtrees curſe, <hi>never fruit grow on you?</hi> Know God is not only angry with thee in the ſtate of ſin and love thereof, but alſo with the coldneſſe, lukewarmneſſe, that thou haſt not thriven and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed more in every grace. Hence are thoſe manifold exhortations to this duty, 2 <hi>Pet. 3. 18. 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 2. ſo that the bleſſing which God gave at firſt to the creatures, encreaſe and multiply, is eſpecially to be ſeen in the new creature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As growth is thus neceſſary, ſo <hi>it can only be, where there is an inward princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of life pre-existent.</hi> Nothing groweth but what hath either a vegetative, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, or rationall life in it. Rowl a ſnow-ball up and down, though you make it much bigger, yet it doth not grow, becauſe it is by <hi>extra-</hi>addition, not by <hi>intra-</hi>reception. An houſe made larger and bigger, yet doth not grow, becauſe here is no vitall principle within. By this means a civill man, a formall man, a temporary beleever, he cannot grow ſpiritually, becauſe he doth not live ſpiritually. There may be indeed a growth in knowledge, parts, inlargements, and duties, but this doth not prove a true growth. Theſe ſproutings are not from internall union with Chriſt, but are outwardly in a common way beſtowed by Chriſt upon them. As in a field of corn, the weeds have a better flouriſhing then in a barren wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, yet the husbandman was not at all that coſt and charges to have weeds come up, but corn; ſo Chriſt died not, or ſet his Officers in the Church to furniſh the wicked with any abilities, but yet living in his Church, they partake of ſeveral pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges by him, which yet were not the chief intent of his death: ſo then, there only is a ſupernaturall growth, where there is a ſupernaturall life, and as you ſee the picture of a childe, it will never come up to be a man, becauſe it is a picture only, there is no life; ſo in any man, that hath only a form of godlineſſe, not feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power of it; he is ſtill upon the ſame hinges where he was, he goeth on in the circle of duties, prayeth as he did, cometh to Church as he; but if you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire for encreaſe, Haſt thou more faith? more communion and fellowſhip with God? doſt thou partake of more vertue and efficacy from him? herein they are wholly ignorant. Oh that we who deſire better times, better trading, better ſetling, did alſo deſire, better beleeving, better mortification; but this cannot be unleſſe there be ſome great work of God within firſt. As he ſaid to his picture which he would fain have had ſtood, and it would not, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, there wants ſomething within, life within; ſo may we ſay, thou praieſt, thou heareſt, thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſt, but there wants ſomething within; till grace be infuſed, it cannot in thy converſation be diffuſed, It muſt be ſhed in thy heart before it can be ſhed abroad in thy life.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. As growth is alwayes upon a ſuppoſed principle within, <hi>ſo it is uniform and aptly proportionable:</hi> as the Apoſtle implyeth in that compariſon, every part hath its proportionable nouriſhment, ſo that in true growth of grace, every particular grace hath its ſutable encreaſe, and herein the people of God are very negligent; if they grow in beleeving, they do not the ſame time grow in repentance and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation, if they grow in joy, they do not encreaſe in fear and trembling. This is their weakneſſe and corruption, for all true encreaſe of grace is uniform. As in naturall bodies, every part groweth, one as well as the other, the little finger as well as the great, whereas now if one part prove bigger then in proportion it ſhould to the other parts, we call it not growth but a diſeaſe: a tympany, a wen, are not growth in the body, but tumours, neither doe they come from a naturall life, but from ſome accidentall defect: ſo then, if thou groweſt in knowledge, in abilities, and not in a practicall conformity to them, this is not properly growth, but ſwellings. And is not this the ſad calamity of this age, men growing out into ſuckers not into fruit, into opinions, parts, not holineſſe, how many monſters <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <pb n="87" facs="tcp:30767:56"/>
there to be ſeen, whoſe heads are bigger then all their bodies? and ſo the hypocrite with his partiall obedience, <hi>Jehu</hi> with his ſeverall acts of reformation, <hi>Herod</hi> with his many things he did, yet encreaſed not in grace, becauſe here was not an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform proportion in all.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In growth though every part do grow as well as the other, yet <hi>not equall to the other; aequè</hi> but not <hi>aequalitèr.</hi> This is that <hi>uniformiter difformiter,</hi> as the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers ſpeak of ſo much, and <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of the particular mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of grace ſuteable to every part, ſo that the eye groweth with the nouriſhment peculiar to the eye; the hand with nouriſhment peculiar to the hand, and ſo one part needeth not ſo much nouriſhment as another, becauſe it is not to grow ſo big as another: and this is diligently to be noted, for where there is true grace, there is a peculiar encreaſe of grace, according to the relation thou art in: If a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, in the graces of a Magiſtrate, if a Miniſter, in the graces of a Miniſter, If a husband, a childe, a ſervant, in the graces ſutable to thoſe relations: and again, this is alſo for comfort, becauſe many of Gods ſervants are troubled, as if they had no grace, becauſe they have not ſo much as others; They have not ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent temper as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> had, they cannot finde themſelves able to doe ſuch things as they did, and therefore they doubt of their grace, but this is as if the little finger ſhould think it doth not grow, becauſe it is not as big as the arm or leg. Every member in Chriſts body hath not the ſame occaſions, is not under ſo many obligations, ſtands not in ſuch particular relations as others do: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the perſonall graces of the one do farre tranſcend the other, inſomuch that ſome are dwarfs, and others gyants, ſome are babes and others are ſtrong men.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Whereas in naturall growth there is a <hi>terminus</hi> prefixed both for the time, and dimenſions, inſomuch that when there is an arrivall to ſuch a ſtature and age, they grow no more; there is nutrition alwaies but not augmentation; Nature hath her <hi>maximum quod ſic,</hi> beyond which ſhe moveth not: but now it is not ſo in the way of grace; <hi>For there we cannot attain to any ſuch degree of grace, but ſtill there is a large room for more;</hi> and it is our ſinne if we preſſe not forward to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.

                     <hi>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly purſue</hi> and endeavour after <hi>that before him.</hi> It is true indeed, God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to every man that meaſure of grace he ſhall receive in this life; yet not ſo, but that it is his duty to do more, even as much as the perfect Law of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, ſo that here is no time to ſtand ſtill. Thy faith ought to be greater and ſtronger, there is no grace in thee but it might be better: Thou canſt never ſay of thy ſpirituall good things, as <hi>Dives</hi> of his temporall; <hi>Soul, take thy eaſe, thou haſt enough laid up in store for thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. In naturall growth, the progreſſe is carried on by naturall ſtrength, with the generall concourſe of Gods providence. But in this ſpirituall progreſſe, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe is of God. At our firſt converſion we being wholly dead in ſinne, God puts into us ſupernaturall principles of grace, wherein man is not cooperant, but meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſubject recipient, but afterwards the heart of man being enlivened and healed thus by grace, he doth cooperate with the grace of God, yet ſo as that a further degree of any grace is wrought by God: Hence he is ſaid in thoſe that are alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy converted <hi>to work the will and the deed,</hi> and that good man praied to God <hi>to encreaſe his grace,</hi> and Gods promiſes are alſo frequent in the Scripture, <hi>to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat and perfect that grace already begun in us.</hi> God doth not beleeve or repent in us, theſe flow immediatly and formally from a man regenerated, but Gods grace doth efficiently excite and ſtir up the will to do theſe good actions: hence it is that when the people of God have through negligence or any corruption grieved the ſpirit, that doth forſake him, and ſo his Sunne goeth many degrees backward; for that aſſertion is no waies juſtifiable, that a godly man cannot fall from any degree of his grace; for its plain <hi>David</hi> did, who therefore praieth to have <hi>a new heart created in him; and the Church is blamed for falling from her firſt love,</hi> and ſo is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:30767:57"/>
                     <hi>to repent,</hi> and to <hi>do her firſt things, to ſtrengthen the things that are ready to die.</hi> The ordinary compariſons are, that a godly man may be like the tree in winter, that hath life in the root, but yet the branches and outſide diſcover none, or as the fire that lyeth buried up in aſhes.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. As in naturall growth, there are many pull-backs, ſometimes a progreſſe and then a regreſſe. Thus it is with corn, trees, and man himſelf before he comes to his term prefixed, and therefore we muſt not ſay Such corn doth not grow, becauſe for ſuch a ſeaſon it may wither and go back: it is enough that in the end it cometh to its full growth and ripeneſſe: <hi>ſo it is with a godly man, he is not to paſſe ſentence of himſelf according to ſome ſeaſons and temptations, for how often is he in a withered and barren condition? but he is to compare one ſeaſon with another.</hi> Yea, godly mens ſlumblings do many times make them go the faſter: as ſometimes after ſickneſſe children grow the faſter, ſo true is that of <hi>Luther, that to the godly not only their</hi> mala paſſiva, <hi>but alſo</hi> mala activa, <hi>through the goodneſſe of God further their growth in holineſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe principles are laid down to explain the nature of encreaſe in grace. In the next place conſider how many waies we may improve grace.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>We bring forth more fruit, when the habits of our graces are more intenſe and enlarged:</hi> for in this ſupernaturall habits agree with morall, that they are capable of intenſion, whereby faith may be made ſtronger, love more active, patience more refined. Their natures do not conſiſt <hi>in indiviſibili,</hi> neither do any attain to the utmoſt of any grace, Chriſt only had fullneſſe, and <hi>the spirit of God was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto him without meaſure;</hi> but in us it is otherwiſe: hence the Diſciples fallen into ſome ambition, our Saviour tels them, <hi>except ye be converted,</hi> that is, further converted and carried on in ſanct fication, <hi>ye cannot enter into the kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi> ſo it is ſaid of the diſciples upon ſome remarkable paſſage which Chriſt did, that they beleeved on him, which is not to be underſtood, as if they did not before beleeve on him, but they were confirmed more. Oh therefore look upon it as a neceſſary teſtimony of grace, to thrive more in godlineſſe, to have many cubits added to thy ſtature, ſay with thy ſelf, oh if the life of grace were in me, ſhould I alwaies be at ſuch a ſtay, would it be no more active and operative; do wicked men grow worſe and worſe, and ſhall not I better and better? We complain of our children if ſent to ſchool, and they are ſtill the ſame, ſtand at a ſtay; and may not the Miniſters of God complain of their people, if they be ſtill the ſame? how ſeverely and terribly doth <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak to the Hebrews, becauſe they were babes ſtil, when they might have been ſtrong men? he threatens them with the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, and totall apoſtaſie, for not to go forward is to go backward, as it is with the boats in the river, if they cannot go on, they are driven backward: Now theſe habits of grace may be made more intenſe, partly by more fervency, when our graces ariſe to a greater heat, our faith and love more burning within us; partly by more eaſineſſe, the waies of godlineſſe are not ſo difficult, corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is more ſubdued, for habits are like a ſecond nature, which doth facilitate and make all actions welcome, ſo that his Commandements are not grievous; partly by more delight and joy, for this floweth from the former: hence when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſrael offered ſo willingly, they rejoyced in that they had ſuch hearts. Now ſee if thou maiſt not in all thy graces be more fervent, more delighting, how often art thou languiſhing, dull, and unwilling? how often are good things even irkſome and tedious to thee? Oh doſt thou not need purging to bring forth more fruit.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Our graces may encreaſe <hi>by a deeper rooting of them in our hearts;</hi> The more they root downwards, the more they bear fruit upward. The Schoolmen diſpute whether habits do encreaſe by addition of new degrees, or deeper radication in the ſubject: But I take it for granted, that in ſupernaturall habits both theſe are different; If therefore thou wouldeſt take any comfort from thy grace, ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holy things <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e now ingrafted in thee, do cleave cloſer to thy heart; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true grace brings ſuch ſweetneſſe with it, that it makes the ſoul have more

plenty and fullneſſe of it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 3. and would be transformed into it, <hi>I no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger live,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, but Chriſt in me.</hi> As therefore originall corruption is ſeated in thee and ſoaked into thy very bones, ſo do thou deſire grace may be incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into thee: you ſee meat while it is in the mouth, it may be taken away, but when it's once turned to nouriſhment, turned into our fleſh and bloud, then it's impoſſible to take it out of our body. The unhappy builder therefore ſuffered that loſſe, becauſe he did not dig deep enough.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Graces grow by the actuall exerciſe of them,</hi> by actuall loving and beleeving the habits of faith and love are more firm and ſtrong. Hence the commands of God are for the acts of grace. Thou ſhalt love, and this is his commandment to beleeve. The habits are commanded obliquely as the fountain, the acts as the ſtream. In morall Philoſophy acts make the habits more intenſe. In Chriſts Parable of the talents, he only is ſaid to have, that doth exerciſe and actually improve his graces; and as our graces encreaſe by the exerciſe of them, ſo by the cooperation of them all together: <hi>Adde to your faith temperance, to temperance brotherly kindeneſſe:</hi> which is not to be underſtood of the habits of grace, for they are all infuſed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and a man may as well be happy with one particular act of glory, as regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with one habit of grace: but we are to interpret it of adding the acts to one another.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The growth of grace is by meliorating or making better the means and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of grace.</hi> The Word and Ordinances are appointed by God as the means to grow, and to cleanſe us more and more. Now if thou wouldeſt have thy gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces flouriſh, thou muſt be more diligent and carefull in the prepared uſe of them; hear better, pray better, make a better improvement of the Miniſtery. The Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples <hi>were mending their nets</hi> becauſe they were inſtruments to get their fiſh. The Artificer muſt ſharpen his tools, if he would live by his trade. Now theſe exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Ordinances are the ſpiritual tools and inſtruments by which the ſoul is promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the way of godlineſſe, and if thou languiſheſt and art careleſſe here, it will quickly appear in thy whole converſation.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Where growth is, there is a speciall care, of all graces to look to that which helps to nouriſhment, and that is Faith.</hi> Faith is the mouth to ſuck the milk of the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, it is the bunch of hyſop that ſprinkles Chriſts bloud upon us to puri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ie us, it is the feeding upon Chriſt: Now then if a man would be nouriſhed and encreaſe in grace, he muſt be ſure this grace hath no obſtructions. As a man is juſtified only by faith, ſo in ſome ſenſe, we may ſay a man is ſanctified, that is, encreaſeth in new obedience, by faith: By faith the branch is preſerved in the olive-tree, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taketh of the fatneſſe thereof. Chriſt praied for <hi>Peter, that his faith might not fail,</hi> as if that grace were kept up, then his courage, zeal, ſelf-deniall, and all other graces would be kept up: <hi>Non per opera venitur ad fidem, ſed per fidem ad opera.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>There is a growth objectively, and that is, when the glorious fullneſſe of God is manifeſted to us more and more.</hi> Though the Sun cannot in it ſelf encreaſe or be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, yet it may to us more and more: therefore it hath its dawning, and its noon; ſo though God and Chriſt cannot be better or more lovely objects then they are, yet they may be ſo to thy affections and deſires, Chriſt a new Chriſt, grace new grace, becauſe there are further apprehenſions and applications of their ſweetneſſe and efficacy.</p>
                  <p>Now to prevent miſtakes, there is a twofold diſpoſition like growth, that is not.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>An encreaſe in knowledge, parts, and abilities.</hi> This is not growth of grace: There is an encreaſe (as you heard) <hi>quoad amplitudinem ſcientia,</hi> and <hi>quoad efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> the latter is the crown and the perfection of the former.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>There is a growth in temporary faith, and love, and ſuch affections,</hi> Which hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites may have, but temporary faith will never grow to be juſtifying; no more then an Ape would grow to be a man, or copper to be gold, for theſe differ ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:30767:58"/>
3. <hi>There is a growth in externals meerly, men are grown more civil and reformed in their lives.</hi> We may behold a wonderfull alteration and change in them, but yet becauſe there is no inward juice of grace, therefore it's not growth of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and ſuch <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Who had eſcaped the pollutions of the fleſh,</hi> yet were dogs and ſwines in their inward diſpoſition.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>There is a growth in additionals of worſhip and ſervice.</hi> When men judge not the preſcribed way by God enough, but inſtitute of their own. This is a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous growth, as if a man ſhould have two heads or ſix fingers. Thus ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is an exceſſe in worſhip, not in the quality of worſhip; for a man can never worſhip God too purely, too fervently, but in the quantity, by inſtituting new means. Hence growth of grace doth not lie in multiplication of duties more then God requireth, but the intention of qualities therein.</p>
                  <p>Uſe of Exhortation, <hi>Judge your ſelves by this touchſtone.</hi> Let this Sermon be <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> to you what <hi>Eliſha</hi>'s body was to the dead body that fell on it, make life to come into you. Do you increaſe in grace? Are you not at a ſtand? the ſame ve were many years ago? conſider God is provoked not only againſt groſſe ſins, but lazy, decaying duties. Do you grow in light but not in heat; in enlargements, but not mortifications? Oh let thy ſoul be afraid and tremble under this truth! In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat God, as he did about his withered hand, Oh Lord, reſtore this withered hand, this withered ſoul of mine! I doubt me, in theſe times many have broke in their Religion, as well as in their ſtates, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to <hi>Timothy, Let your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting appear to all.</hi>

                  <p>THe Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> as he was the beloved Diſciple, ſo doth he frequently and vehemently preſſe the duty of love to the Church of God, for that being a ſpiritual body, love is as neceſſary to preſerve them, as nerves and ligaments are in a natural body.</p>
                  <p>The Arguments uſed in this Chapter for love are many: As</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That love is a ſtream iſſuing from no leſſe glorious fountain then God himſelf is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That it is a demonſtration of our ſpiritual Nativity, <hi>That we are born of God.</hi>

contemplation and conſtant beholding of the beauty and luſtre of Gods Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, his Wiſdom, Holineſſe, but eſpecially his Love to us in Chriſt, all which doth kindle love in us again. And from this beholding of God doth ariſe that neer union with God, which is Gods <hi>dwelling in us, and we in him.</hi> All which the Apoſtle makes manifeſt to us by the effect, <hi>viz. by the Spirit, of which he hath given us.</hi> It is needleſſe to trouble you with the ſeveral acceptions of the word <hi>Spirit;</hi> It is enough to know, That by <hi>Spirit</hi> is not meant the eſſence of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, for that is impartible; nor of any immediate teſtimony of the Spirit, as the phraſe will imply, <hi>He hath given us of his Spirit,</hi> which denoteth ſome effects of the Spirit, and of effects, not the common effects, for they are not a ſure Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods dwelling in us, and we in him; it remaineth therefore that it be underſtood of the gracious works of Gods Spirit, whereby in all our duties we are lifted up by Gods Spirit to do them in an higher manner, then natural ſtrength could enable us unto: ſo that the Obſervation is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſpiritual performing of holy duties, is a ſure ſign and demonſtration of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>

                     <hi>in God. and God in us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the ſame Apoſtle 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 24. for as miracles did truly demonſtrate thoſe that did them, to be endued with the power of Gods Spirit from above, and they wrought miracles to confirm men in this belief, that they were ſent of God; Thus the ſpiritual doing of thoſe things required of thee, are a kinde of miracles to confirm thy ſoul, that thou art of God. And as actual diſcourſe and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter do infallibly prove a rational life, becauſe theſe actions tranſcend a ſenſitive life; ſo do ſpiritual praying, hearing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> evidence a ſpiritual life, becauſe of their tranſcendency.</p>
                  <p>For the opening of this point, which is neceſſary (and the want of which <hi>Paul</hi> did ſo greatly bewail in the <hi>Corinthians, I could not ſpeak unto you as unto ſpiritual, but as carnal)</hi> take notice of theſe things by way of a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>As in natural things there is a ſenſitive ſoul above the vegetative, and a ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal above the ſenſitive, ſo (with more diſproportion) there is a ſpiritual life vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed by the holy Ghoſt above a rational.</hi> Inſomuch that take the moſt rational man, that is endued with all intellectual abilities and moral perfections; ſo that he be <hi>Ultimus conatus naturae,</hi> as one ſaid of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> yet he is no more able to do any thing ſpiritually, or to apprehend what are thoſe ſpiritual operations, then a worm can comprehend the reaſon of the moſt wiſe men. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The natural man perceiveth not the things of God,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that is, one who doth <hi>excolere animam,</hi> minde the poliſhing and dreſſing of his ſoul, ſuch as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Seneca.</hi> Now howſoever prophane men mock at the word <hi>Spirit,</hi> and the works thereof, yet that there is ſuch an immediate participation of the holy Ghoſt in the operations thereof, the Scripture doth abundantly teſtifie, <hi>John 3. 6. That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh, and that which is born of the ſpirit is ſpirit,</hi> where our Saviour makes ſuch a ſpiritual birth abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, and ſheweth two contrary kinds of ſinne, one <hi>carnal,</hi> abiding in the condition they were born in, the other <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> made ſo by God; and the Apoſtle in both pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces uſeth the <hi>abſtract</hi> for the <hi>concrete,</hi> for more efficacy. This afterwards he cals, <hi>Being born of the Spirit.</hi> So that as a man born of a man, hath <hi>indolem humanam,</hi> is and doth more then a beaſt: ſo he that is born of the Spirit, hath <hi>indolem di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinam,</hi> and doth more then a man. Indeed our Saviour makes the original of this ſpiritual being unknown to us, which he expreſſeth by a compariſon from the winde, or as <hi>Maldonat</hi> will have it from the ſoul of a man, which we do not perceive infuſed into us, or how we come by it; ſo in this great work of Gods Spirit, <hi>Motum ſentimus, modum neſcimus;</hi> God <hi>breathed</hi> into <hi>Adam</hi> a <hi>natural life,</hi> and a <hi>ſoul,</hi> but this is a great mercy which God doth for his people. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſpiritual being and working is of ſuch important conſequence, you may obſerve the Scripture in other places diligently inculcating of it.

In <hi>Adam,</hi> the holy Ghoſt wrought his holineſſe, as the third Perſon in the Godhead; but now he worketh grace in us by another oeconomy or diſpenſation, as the Spirit of the Father, and of Chriſt. And that all this operation of Gods Spirit may not be rejected as a fancy, he ſaith, <hi>He dwels in us as in his Temple,</hi> which deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a fixed permanency, <hi>and abiding in us;</hi> It is true, the godly diſpute, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a godly man be made partaker of the graces of Gods Spirit only, or beſides theſe of the Spirit it ſelf? The learned differ herein, but certainly theſe expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons do inferre, That the godly do not only receive the graces of Gods Spirit, but the Spirit alſo it ſelf, only how to explain this, ſeemeth to me very difficult, if not impoſſible.</p>

Gal. 5. which doth not denote the firſt enlivening of us; in which ſenſe the poet ſaid, <hi>Mens agitat molem,</hi> but a powerfull conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual inclination of our hearts unto thoſe things that are ſpiritual; and this deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that even in the progreſſe of Sanctification, we need a continuall help and influence from Gods Spirit, according to that of <hi>Auguſtine, Et agis &amp; ageris, &amp; tunc benè agis, ſi à bono agaris,</hi> and when we obey theſe conducts of Gods Spirit, <hi>We are ſaid to walk in the Spirit.</hi> Thus <hi>Gal. 5. 24.

baſer mettal can plead it ſelf to be gold, becauſe of ſome common accidents there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, and therefore their morality, intellectual perfections are altogether fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for ſo it's good to know that as Spirit differs from Spirit, one ſpiritual man from another, as one Starre differs from another in glory, inſomuch that one would wonder how the ſame heaven ſhould at laſt receive men ſo different: ſo one carnal man differeth from another carnal man, as much as a garden from a dunghill, and one would wonder that the ſame hell ſhould be at laſt the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle of ſo different converſations. Corruption is not only in groſſe actions, but in the minde and underſtanding of a man, yea the more glorious it appeareth to be many times, it is the more carnal; As you ſee the Devils are called <hi>unclean ſpirits,</hi> who yet are not guilty of groſſe bodily ſinnes. Oh therefore that you would conſider, there is an higher and more glorious way of living then that which moſt attain unto: Chriſtianity ſtampt upon a meer civil man, deſtitute of Gods Spirit, is but like the Kings Picture upon a braſſe ſhilling, as long as the materials are counterfeit, the ſuperſcription will not advantage. <hi>Baptiſm, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,</hi> and all other glorious ſuperſcriptions put upon thee abiding in a morall eſtate, is no advantage for heaven; there muſt be power from Gods Spirit in thee.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Corollary is, <hi>That the gracious and ſanctifying works of Gods Spirit,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Gracious and ſanctifying works of the Spirit only a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> common gifts.</note> 
                     <hi>are only a teſtimony of being in God, not thoſe common gifts of his Spirit, ſuch as parts, abilities, aſſistance and enlargements in Duties, no nor Prophecies and Revelations, if ſuch were to be had.</hi> Theſe indeed men moſt covet after, as accompanied with more applauſe and admiration; but it's better to ſpeak one word with the grace of Gods Spirit, then ten thouſand with the meer gift of his Spirit. One would wonder indeed, why God ſhould diſtribute ſuch glorious gifts to thoſe, whom he doth not love to eternal life; but his waies are alwaies juſt, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times unknown to us; yea there are other workings of Gods Spirit that come nearer to ſanctification, and yet are not it. Such are, ſome ſorrow about ſinne, ſome illumination in judgement, ſome joy and delight in the Ordinances, yet theſe argue only Gods Spirit working in us, not dwelling in us. And theſe opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are only <hi>tranſient</hi> not <hi>permanent;</hi> and it is a good rule of <hi>Bonaventures, Illa tantum dicuntur eſſe in animâ, quae ſunt in eâ per modum quietis, caetera ſunt magis ab animâ, quam in animâ.</hi> Thoſe things are properly in the ſoul which are in it by way of reſt, and centre in it. Yea hence it is (which is much to be obſerved) that all thoſe operations of Gods Spirit in an unregenerate man, whether of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer or latter ſort, they are <hi>provocative</hi> or <hi>excitative</hi> of the fleſh onely in a man. Thus <hi>Judas</hi> by all thoſe gifts of Gods Spirit to him, was made more fleſhly. A temporary believer by all his faith and joy is made more fleſhly; for hereby he groweth more confident in himſelf, leſſe poor in his Spirit, and ſo leſſe perceiving the need of Chriſt, and his grace, by which he is more ſetled in a carnal way. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerve, whether all thy aſſiſtance, enlargements, tranſient motions of Gods Spirit, have not this event in thee, to make thee carnal and corrupt in a refined manner.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, Let us conſider in what way this ſpirituality is manifeſted. <note place="margin">Wherein ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality in duty is manifeſted, and how it is a ſign. 1.</note> And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The nature of them is different from all meer humane actions.</hi> The acts of faith, love, and other graces, are above the whole ſphear and power of nature; <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> were able to do ſome wonderfull things, as well as <hi>Moſes,</hi> but there were others again, in which they had no power at all. Thus there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny humane actions of prudence and juſtice, that make men very lovely and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable in the eyes of others; but then there are other actions, ſuch as the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of habitual graces, and to this they can no more reach, then a dwarf can touch the heavens. Hence the Scripture ſometimes addeth the word Spirit, when it would difference grace from humane actions, 2 <hi>Cor. 4. 13. Having the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of faith,</hi> Epheſ. 6. 18. <hi>Supplication in the Spirit.</hi> Phil. 3. 3. <hi>Which worſhip God in
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:30767:60"/>
the Spirit.</hi> Col. 1. 18. <hi>Your love in the Spirit.</hi> Now this addition [in the Spirit] im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieth that there are many actions that are done by us, but unleſſe they be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the Spirit, they come ſhort of that divine and excellent nature, which God looketh at. <hi>Gratia non tollit, ſed attollit naturam,</hi> Grace doth not deſtroy the natural faculties and actions of the ſoul, but it elevateth or ſublimateth them to a more noble conſideration; and this is the reaſon why a natural man can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is truly and theologically good, becauſe of the tranſcendent excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it's nature, but this is hardly diſcerned; and if there be many, yea moſt things in nature, whoſe eſſence we perceive not, it is no wonder if we be ſo dull in ſupernatural.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Spiritual actions are diſcovered by the fountain from whence they flow,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> A <hi>ſpiritual principle,</hi> which the Scripture cals a <hi>divine nature,</hi> yea the <hi>life of God.</hi> As <hi>Iſaac</hi> is called <hi>A childe of the promiſe,</hi> becauſe he was born by the meer word and power of God, <hi>Sarahs womb</hi> being a <hi>dead womb;</hi> Thus alſo all godly actions, are actions of the promiſe, having their exiſtence meerly by that, mans natural power being altogether a <hi>dead womb.</hi> And this alſo can little help as a ſigne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the root of our actions, like thoſe of trees, lieth under ground, and is ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcerned.</p>
                  <p>Therefore thirdly, <hi>In ſpiritual actions, thoſe motives and ends that are attractive</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>are ſpiritual.</hi> Every action is ſpecified by the formality of the object, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious actions they are ſpiritual, when the reaſon or motive of doing them is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. Hence they are called <hi>Virgins, and they follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth.</hi> This is that <hi>godly ſimplicity Paul</hi> ſpeaks of in himſelf, whereby, as <hi>of God, and to God he did all things. For want of this,</hi> God by the Prophet rejects the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liations and faſtings the Jews did, which yet were ſpecious enough, becauſe they did it not to him, even to him; and this is a ſign that may by the help of Gods Spirit be diſcerned in us. For as the voluptuous man is carried out to ſinful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, becauſe of the ſweetneſſe in them; or as a rational man is deſirous to finde out truth, becauſe truth is a pleaſing connatural object to his underſtanding; ſo is a ſpiritual man inclining to all ſpiritual objects, becauſe of thoſe ſpiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations that are therein. <hi>Delicata anima quaſi abominatur, per modum commodi vel praemii diligere Deum.</hi> Now in all religious duties there are many ſpiritual at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractives, ſuch as the command of God, enjoying of, and communion with him, the light of Gods countenance and increaſe of grace. Goe therefore and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine thy own ſelf, What is the loadſtone in all holy Duties? What is the mark thou aimeſt at? It is the intention that is the pulſe to feel how thy heart is.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Spirituality is diſcerned by the manner.</hi> Where the Spirit of God is <note place="margin">4</note> there is zeal, fervency, activity. So that a formal, cuſtomary, ſuperficial perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of holy duties is extreamly oppoſite to a ſpiritual deportment in them. <hi>Neſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit tarda molimina Spiritus ſanctus.</hi> Hence it was that it appeared <hi>in fire,</hi> and in a <hi>mighty ruſhing winde.</hi> Thus <hi>Stephen</hi> and others are ſaid <hi>to be full of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> when there was ſtrong and powerful workings of grace in them. <hi>Elias</hi> was a man of fire and zeal for God, and God gave him a ſutable reward, <hi>He was carried to heaven in a fiery chariot,</hi> as a conquerour triumphing over all enemies. This the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh of, when <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 6. he ſpeaks of the oldneſſe of the letter, and the newneſs of Spirit. It is an excellent expreſſion, and an happy frame of heart, though ſome of late have abuſed that phraſe to dangerous errours. Hence the Scripture in an Hebraiſm cals the excellency and efficacy of a thing, <hi>The Spirit of it; As the Spirit of wiſdom, The Spirit of underſtanding, The Spirit of meekneſſe.</hi> As the body without the ſoul is dead, ſo is a mans ſpirit without Gods Spirit in any duty. Oh think of this, you who ſpend your daies in an empty formal way of Religion; call as God by the Prophet doth, <hi>Come, O winde, and cauſe theſe dry bones to gather together and live.</hi> Cry as the Church doth, <hi>Ariſe, O North, and blow, O South, upon our Gardens, that our ſpices may ſmell;</hi> How few ſpiritual Chriſtians? How few ſpiritual Duties, publick or private are there? The ſhip of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:30767:60"/>
thy ſoul brings home no rich traffick, becauſe it wants this winde. Not that a man who finds himſelf dead and cold, without the effectual power of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſhould neglect Praier and other Duties, till the Spirit breathe on him, as ſome have perniciouſly taught. For our Saviour <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. ſuppoſeth that we are <hi>to pray for the Spirit;</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> how often doth he pray, <hi>That God would quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken him?</hi> But truly ſuch is the coldneſſe, emptineſſe, that now all Religion is fallen into, that if ever one might deſire a Sermon to be cloathed with as much dread and terrour as the promulgation of the Law was, it might be deſired in this point. Till therefore thou eject thoſe ſpirits that are ſo contrary to Gods Spirit, as the Spirit of the world eſpecially, never look to take any comfort by thy Religion.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Leſt this Spirit ſhould be a deluſion, therefore in the next place, <hi>The</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>workings of Gods Spirit are orderly, not inordinate, but exactly to the Rule.</hi> I build this particular on the Greek word, <hi>Gal. 5. 25. If we live in the Spirit, let us walk by the Spirit,</hi> that is as the word implieth, <hi>orderly, methodically,</hi> as when it's ſaid, <hi>As many as ſhall walk by this canon or rule, Peace be on them.</hi> The Spirit of God putteth a man upon nothing that is againſt the principles of nature and ſound reaſon, nor againſt the word of God; but <hi>verbum eſt vehiculum ſpiritus,</hi> the word is that <hi>fiery chariot</hi> in which the Spirit of God cometh. When the Apoſtle in the Chapter before, <hi>verſ.</hi> ult. had given us this as a ſign of our being in God, that we have of his Spirit, preſently he addeth, <hi>Believe not every Spirit.</hi> Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pretends operations, inſtincts and revelations from the Spirit for duties not juſtifiable by the Word, ſets up a falſe and unholy ſpirit, for the pure and holy Spirit of God: But of this more largely in the falſe ſigns. All the motions and operations of Gods Spirit are ſoft, quiet, ordered and conſonant to Gods word.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Where ſpiritual operations are, there is a free and ſpontaneous inclination</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>unto the duties God requireth.</hi> As there is in an hungry man to eat, and a thirſty man to drink. <hi>Gal. 5. 18. If ye be led by the Spirit, ye are not under the Law.</hi> The Apoſtle meaneth not the Antinomian ſenſe, as if they needed not the Law to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, guide and excite them, for he preſſeth with commands in the ſame Chapter to mortifie ſinne; and they may as well deny the uſe of the whole Scripture, as the Law in that ſenſe, for all the word of God is a rule and a guide; but he ſpeaks of the terrifying threatning and extorting power of the Law, whereby a man doth that which is good with the ſame Spirit, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> made brick under <hi>Pharoahs</hi> oppreſſion; of this the Apoſtle ſpeaks, and that ſo farre as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, for the unregenerate part findes the Law a <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to it, commanding brick and giving no ſtraw, injoining work and giving no ſtrength. Therfore where the Spirit of God is, there they are <hi>a willing people,</hi> yea <hi>willingneſſes,</hi> as <hi>Pſa.</hi> 110. in the plural number, and abſtract it ſelf. And ſo again, <hi>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Where the Spirit of God thus worketh, there are ſtrong oppoſitions and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">7.</note> 
                     <hi>by the fleſh and unregenerate part.</hi> Gal. 5. And this oppoſition is not of the inferiour appetite to the underſtanding, but of every ſanctified part to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified part in the ſame faculty, an holy regenerate will againſt the unholy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate will; Therefore it's a great falſhood of the <hi>Hemiſnites,</hi> that ſay, <hi>Its impoſſible for the ſame will to be at the ſame time good and bad in part,</hi> therefore they ſay, <hi>It is ſucceſſively good or bad,</hi> and ſo by this conſequence a man may have a regenerate and unregenerate will ſucceſſively a thouſand times in a day. But of this combate we have ſpoken already.</p>
                  <p>Uſe of Exhortation, Not to reſt in any Naturals, Morals or Intellectuals, but <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> to breathe after Spirituals. As the body of a man is firſt Natural, and then by the reſurrection it will be made glorious; ſo it is with the ſoul. If therefore you take all your ingenuous and lovely perfections, which you have by educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:30767:61"/>
or reſtraining grace for true ſaving grace, you take <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> (as it were) <hi>for Chriſt.</hi> Be therefore in the number of ſpirituall ones; Morall Philoſophy, the Lectures of <hi>Socrates</hi> and other Heathens, have put a man upon an external Reformation, but Gods word only is the inſtrument to convey his Spirit into our hearts.</p>

In the words, you have two Propoſitions;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the godly even in this life are already <hi>paſſed from death to life.</hi> Some render the Greek word <hi>tranſlated,</hi> and thereupon <hi>Eſtius</hi> obſerves, becauſe we are paſſive in this priviledge, that it is not to be attributed to our merits, but to the grace of God: Now the Apoſtle uſeth the Preterperfect tenſe, and not the Preſent, becauſe of the certainty of it, and his right to it, <hi>Qui jus ad rem habet, rem ipſam habere videtur,</hi> ſaith the Lawyer; you have the like expreſſion <hi>John 5. 24. By this life</hi> ſome underſtand the <hi>life of grace,</hi> and by <hi>death, the death of ſinne,</hi> as if the <hi>love of the Brethren</hi> were a ſign of our being in the <hi>ſtate of grace,</hi> and then there is good reaſon for uſing the Preterperfect tenſe. But although this may be part, yet it doth not comprehend all, for <hi>eternal life,</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo included herein.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Propoſition is, That <hi>Love of the Brethren</hi> is that ſign and mark whereby we know aſſuredly, that we are in this happy eſtate; ſo that our love is no merit or cauſe, but a ſign only; hence it is good to obſerve, that this very ſelf-ſame priviledge of <hi>paſſing from death to life,</hi> is attributed to <hi>faith,</hi> Joh. 5. 24. but in a different ſenſe to faith, as that inſtrumental cauſe, which puts us into ſuch a condition, to love as an effect or ſign only; for though love uniteth us to Chriſt as well as faith, yet faith doth it <hi>Intus recipiendo,</hi> by inward receiving of Chriſt to us, love <hi>extra agendo,</hi> by going out in our works for him; Hence the union by love is <hi>poſterior</hi> to that of faith; Hence alſo it is that if love ſhould ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, the dignity of it would ariſe from the act of love, becauſe it's union con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in doing ſomething out of us, but in faiths union, the dignity is wholly from the <hi>object, viz.</hi> Chriſt imbraced, becauſe this union is by inward reception and application.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That love of the brethren is a ſign of true grace.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>As the Apoſtle makes it here a ſign to our ſelves, ſo in other places to others, <hi>Hereby ſhall all men know ye are my Diſciples, if ye love one another;</hi> he doth not ſay, If ye work miracles, if ye caſt out devils, but if ye love. Hence the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Peter, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 7. bids them adde to <hi>Godlineſſe, brotherly kindeneſſe.</hi> As if we could not have any true comfort from all our religious duties towards God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe this alſo be added to it, or with it, for ſo <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>To open this duty of love to the Brethren three things are conſiderable, which we ſhall ſpeak to, 1. The Act it ſelf, <hi>Love.</hi> 2. The Object, <hi>Our Brethren.</hi> And 3. The Effects.</p>

Of love.</note> we naturally love our parents, our children, but not ſo the godly, hence love is made the fruit of the Spirit; <hi>To love a man, becauſe of the image of God in him,</hi> becauſe he is holy, is wrought only by Gods Spirit. Naturally we hate <note place="margin">1. To love a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man becauſe of the Image of God in him.</note> God, becauſe he is an holy God, his Law, becauſe it is an holy Law, and his children, becauſe they are an holy people. Hence the Schoolmen ſay, That love to God and to our neighbour, becauſe of God, are not two acts of love, no more then the will of the end by means, is a two-fold act of the will; and this appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by the command <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 37. where we are commanded <hi>to love God with all our might,</hi> all we have and can do, and yet our neighbour alſo, which could not be if our love to another in ſubordination to God be not conſidered, as the ſame with the act of loving God; and this is much more true in loving of a godly man, whom we do love, not only becauſe of Gods command, and for God (as we ought to do all men) but becauſe of God in him, his image there, in which ſenſe <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaid, he did <hi>Diligere Christum habitantem in Auguſtino.</hi> There is a rule out of <hi>Ariſtotle, Idemeſt motus animae in imaginem &amp; rem.</hi> It is the ſame moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whereby the ſoul is carried to the image or <hi>ſpecies</hi> of a thing, and the thing it ſelf, as we ſee it in the acts of the underſtanding and of the ſenſes, which rule <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and other Papiſts wretchedly abuſe, to prove the ſame religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:30767:62"/>
both in kinde and degree, to be given unto the image of God, and God himſelf but in our inſtance it is true, when we love God himſelf, and a godly man, becauſe of Gods image in him, this is the ſame act or motion of the ſoul, and ariſeth from the ſame habit of grace, and therefore doth this Apoſtle argue neceſſarily from the poſition of the one to the poſition of the other, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of one to the negation of the other, he that doth not love his brother, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not God, according to the rule of the <hi>Hebrews, Qui amat ſupra amat infra.</hi> We are not then ſpeaking of a love, which cometh by the power of free-will, but of a grace infuſed into us by Gods Spirit, which as it's ſupernatural in it's original, ſo alſo in it's operations and motives; The effects are ſupernatural, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſying and emptying themſelves in induſtry about their ſouls; and their ends alſo, becauſe they ſee Gods likeneſſe in them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>This love is not verbal or complemental,</hi> ſuch as that of the world, <note place="margin">2. It is not verbal but an inward deep affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate grace.</note> which hath great veins, but little bloud in them, but it is <hi>a most inward deep affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate grace,</hi> moving all the bowels within. Thus <hi>Rom. 12. Be kindely affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to one another in love,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, doth imply an inward root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inclination, ſuch as is in mothers to their tender infants. There are thoſe who ſeem to love godly men, but it is when the times favour them, if there be any <hi>benign conſtellations</hi> for ſuch, then they reſpect them, otherwiſe in their heart and inclinations they can no waies endure thoſe that are godly. When therefore we ſpeak of loving godly men, we mean not a fair loving carriage, a kinde behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our towards them, which makes thee farre from all railing or oppoſing of them, but ſuch an affection as is rooted in thy heart.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>In reſpect of the object, Brethren,</hi> this is included,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That this love be to them, becauſe they are brethren.</hi> We may love godly men <note place="margin">II. The object of our love the Brethren. 1. Becauſe they are Brethren.</note> for other reſpects then their godlineſſe, becauſe they may be wiſe men, learned men, potent men in the Kingdom, or men that have loved us, and ſhewed us much kindneſſe, but this is nothing of grace, here is onely nature all the while. Hence the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>Love the brotherhood</hi> in the Abſtract, becauſe it is the <hi>brotherhood.</hi> The <hi>Waſps</hi> flie about the Tradeſmans ſhop, not out of love to him, but the hony and fruit that is there. The <hi>Crows</hi> and <hi>Vultures</hi> ſit by the dying beaſt, not becauſe they love it, but for themſelves. Thus godly men may be loved for carnal ends and advantages, and no wonder at this, ſeeing ſuch a mercenary and hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal love may be profered to God himſelf, as we ſee in the hypocrites of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>As to the brethren, becauſe godly, ſo the more godly the more we love them;</hi> For as the covetous man, the more wealth increaſeth the more he loveth it; And <note place="margin">2. The more god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the more we love them.</note> the voluptuous man, the more ſweetneſſe and delight in luſts, the more greedy is he of them; thus it is here, he loveth all the godly, but thoſe that moſt excell in the purity, power and practice of it, he loveth them moſt, <hi>Sicut ſe habet ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliciter ad ſimpliciter, ita magis ad magis,</hi> if godlineſſe be the reaſon why we love, then the more godlineſſe, the more love. And this is much to be obſerved, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it diſcovers much hypocriſie in many men, who fancy to themſelves that they love godlineſſe in the <hi>Idea,</hi> in the <hi>notion,</hi> but when it cometh to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by wife, children or neighbours, then they cannot endure it. As alſo thoſe, who love godly men in low principles, not walking ſo exactly and accurately as they ought, better then the godly with high principles, that are alwaies putting on to more godlineſſe.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>It implieth we love all godly men,</hi> for ſo that phraſe in the Abſtract, <hi>Love the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. We muſt love all godly men.</note> 
                     <hi>Brotherhood,</hi> ſuppoſeth, that is, Take every godly man, rich as well as poor, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed as well as honoured, low and baſe as well as high and eſteemed, thou doſt love all of them. It may be thy love is reſtrained to love godly men onely, that are of thy conſtitution, condition or opinion; but then there are others upon whom thou caſteſt no favourable aſpect at all. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> doth much condemn that practice of differencing the poor godly from the rich, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 1, 2. where the Apoſtle doth not abſolutely prohibit a civil differencing of men in
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:30767:62"/>
place from others, but when it is done with an humane reſpect, immoderately regarding wealth more then godlineſſe, and when it's done to the contempt and diſgrace, or diſcouragement of the godly poor; hence he bids them conſider that though they be poor, yet God hath choſen them rich in faith: Now this carnal reſpect of perſons the Apoſtle makes a great ſinne, both becauſe hereby he ſaith, They become judges of evil thoughts, that is, theſe thoughts of theirs in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus are wicked and ſinfull, and partly becauſe hereby the name of God is blaſphemed; hence <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. he cals Chriſt, <hi>The Lord of glory,</hi> implying, that thoſe things which are godly and gracious ſhould be glorious to us. So then as hatred of ſin is <hi>totius ſpeciei,</hi> we hate every kinde of ſinne; ſo is love of the Brethren, of all Brethren, making no difference in this reſpect. Indeed there is a love of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity which we may ſhew more to one godly man then another; thus Chriſt loved <hi>John</hi> more then the other Diſciples; but we ſpeak of a gracious love; and in this we ought not to attend to humane reſpects but evangelical meerly; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Apoſtle cals it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, when we in judging look to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe then the merits of the perſon, or the cauſe. This we are all apt and very prone unto; See we therefore that in Goſpel-love we attend only to Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderations.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, <hi>Conſider the effects by which this love to the godly diſcovers it ſelf.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">III. The Effect, of this love. 1. Not to be aſhamed to own them as Brethren in perſecution.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And 1. <hi>By not being aſhamed to own them as Brethren, and joyn with them in the times of perſecution.</hi> The Church of God hath had many <hi>Swallow-</hi>friends that will ſtay with her no longer then Summer; our Saviour foreſeeing this proneneſs to Apoſtaſie, antidoteth againſt it, <hi>He that is aſhamed of me in the midſt of a crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed generation, of him my Father alſo will be aſhamed before the Angels.</hi> The world that is full of ſcorns and reproaches, <hi>The holy Brethren, The holy Sisters,</hi> now men are through their pride and corruption aſhamed of ſuch waies. This argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thou haſt no love to them. It was obſerved by the Heathens how the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians loved one another, <hi>Ecce quam ſe mutuò diligunt &amp; fratres ſe vocant!</hi> Now then as it is noted of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. that he was not aſhamed to be the God of believers; thus alſo may we obſerve of thee, thou art not aſhamed to be called one of the believers; Thy ſpeech, converſation, whole deportment ſhall betray thee to be one that followeth Chriſt. It's obſerved by ſome, That there were but few hypocrites comparatively in the firſt Plantation of the Churches by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, becauſe there was ſuch certain and preſent danger to all thoſe that imbraced their way, and no advantage at all to carnal conſiderations, yet for all that ſome hypocrites there were. It was a weakneſſe in <hi>Nicodemus, who came to Jeſus by night,</hi> he dared not publickly own him, becauſe of the Jews. Examine therefore thy ſelf, if thou loveſt the godly, then this will appear when godlineſſe is the onely ſcorned, reproached and perſecuted way that is. It is ſtrange to obſerve how godlineſſe in the power of it doth diminiſh reſpect in the world, <hi>Bonus vir Caius &amp; prudens, niſi quod Chriſtianus,</hi> A learned man, a wiſe man, a good man, but only <hi>too preciſe, too puritanical,</hi> enclining too much to ſtrictneſſe. If it were an Heathen that derideth all Chriſtianity that ſaith thus, it would be no wonder; but for a Chriſtian, who by his profeſſion is ingaged to all this practice of holineſs, it is unſufferable; if we may have too much godlineſs, then too much of heaven and happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>By rejoycing and delighting in other mens godlineſſe and abilities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. By rejoycing in other mens godlineſſe, though thou art deſpiſed.</note> 
                     <hi>the Kingdom of God is advanced, though it be an umbrage and over ſhadowing of all our glory, though we be laid aſide and accounted as no body.</hi> As in the ſweeteſt fruit ſometimes worms do grow; ſo in the choiſeſt Chriſtians there will be envies, emulations and repinings at one anothers excellencies. Thus the Diſciples of Chriſt did twice ſtrive about greatneſſe, <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples muttered becauſe all runne after Chriſt; but how graciouſly doth <hi>John</hi> deal with them, <hi>I muſt decreaſe and he encreaſe.</hi> So that this love of the Brethren is a more ſpiritual and difficult work then we are aware off. Thou loveſt a godly man that liveth remote from
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:30767:63"/>
thee, but how art thou to one that is thy neighbour of the ſame profeſſion and calling? now it may be the eminency of his graces and worth carrieth away the eſteem and repute from thee, Canſt thou for all this rejoyce in his graces and abilities, praiſe God for him, and ſo that his glory be advanced, thou careſt not though God lay thee aſide, as a broken veſſel? This is a good ſymptome of grace. Oh (Beloved) if we conſider the jealouſies, heart-burnings, contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, envyings, ſtrifes that are among the godly, Doth not this demonſtrate that they are in a great meaſure carnal? Are not moſt of theſe contentions from the fleſh, who ſhall have moſt power, whoſe way ſhall have moſt followers and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers? Whereas true love to godlineſſe manifeſteth it ſelf in this, that it rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth in the graces of others, praiſeth God for them. It is an high ſinne to make godlineſſe a faction, a party, as that whereby I will have carnal advantages. The Apoſtle contradicteth this, when he ſaith, <hi>We know no man, no not Chriſt himſelf after the fleſh.</hi> By reaſon of this ſelf-pleaſing it is that at laſt we incloſe godlineſſe, and monopolize it to our own ſelves, that none ſhall be godly but thoſe in our way. Thus the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> would call no men Chriſtians but themſelves. Thus <hi>Tertullian,</hi> when he turned <hi>Montanist,</hi> pretending to Revelations of the Spirit, wrote a book againſt the Orthodox, which he called <hi>Adverſus Pſychicos,</hi> as if they all were but carnal, and natural men. Thus many rigid <hi>Lutherans</hi> diſpute the Queſtion, Whether <hi>Calviniſts</hi> may be reckoned as Brethren, and they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine negatively. Take we heed therefore, how we envy the graces of others that overtop us. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> thought this <hi>to be the ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt, or ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near.</hi> But it cannot be ſo, becauſe we have inſtances even of ſome godly men who have been tainted this way. It is an hard thing not to look upon godlineſſe and the truths of God, as ours, more then as Gods, which doth breed carnal and humane diſpoſitions in us. Know therefore that ſo farre as thou envieſt and grudgeſt at the excellency of anothers godlineſſe overtopping thee ſo far, thou haſt no love to the Brethren.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>This love to the Brethren is manifeſted by the contrary,</hi> viz. <hi>A zeal</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. This love to the godly is manifeſted by a zeal againſt ſinners.</note> 
                     <hi>againſt ſinners, an impatiency and holy grief at the wickedneſſe of others.</hi> That as the Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Cain</hi> hated <hi>Abel,</hi> becauſe <hi>his own works were evil, and Abels good,</hi> ſo a godly <hi>Abel</hi> is grieved at the converſation of the wicked, becauſe <hi>his own are good, and the others evil.</hi> Thus a godly man is deſcribed by this Character, <hi>Pſal. 35. 4. In whoſe eyes a vile perſon is contemned, but he honoureth thoſe that fear the Lord.</hi> You have a notable inſtance of this in <hi>Lot,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 8. where righteous <hi>Lot</hi> is ſaid <hi>to vex his ſoul by hearing and ſeeing the wicked Sodomites.</hi> The Greek word ſignifieth to torment his ſoul, and it is uſed of the damned in hell. There is alſo an emphaſis in the phraſe, <hi>his ſoul,</hi> he doth not ſay himſelf, but his ſoul, as if a ſword had pierced. Thus God ſaith, <hi>His ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in the backeſlider,</hi> when he would expreſſe his great abhorring of ſuch an one. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this torment is amplified in the inſtruments by which, both <hi>in ſeeing and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Lot</hi> was among the <hi>Sodomites</hi> as the Dove among Hawks, a Sheep among Wolves, a roſe among thorns, a bright Starre in a dark night; and this did ſo much afflict him, that <hi>Auguſt. in praef. Pſal.</hi> 69 cals this a perſecution, and ſaith, <hi>The evil deeds of the Sodomites were a perſecution of Lot.</hi> Hereupon the ſame Father proves, <hi>That the perſecutions of godly mens ſouls by wicked ſcandals, is worſe then that of Tyrants killing the bodies.</hi> And <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks excellently to this purpoſe of the Churches bitterneſſe, <hi>Amara prius fuit in nece Martyrum, amarior poſtea in conflictu haereticorum, ſed amariſſima in moribus domeſticorum.</hi> Try thy love to the godly, by thy grief and trouble that cometh to thee, through the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of others; for ſeeing by their evil deeds, God is ſo much diſhonoured, how can it be but that with <hi>David, Rivers of water ſhould runne down thy eyes, becauſe men keep not Gods Law?</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>He hated thoſe who hated God with a perfect hatred,</hi> that is, a full, abſolute, irreconcilable hatred, which is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of their will not their perſons.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:30767:63"/>
Fourthly, <hi>This emptieth it ſelf in doing and procuring all ſpiritual good to them.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. In doing and procuring all ſpiritual good to them.</note> To love is to will good to another, that is, their proper, convenient good. Thus to love the Brethren is to pray much for them, to be diligent in the exhorting and provoking of one another to good; for of ſuch a love and hatred which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards ſpiritual things, the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, as by his inſtance in <hi>Cains</hi> hatred ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, which was from a ſpiritual conſideration, <hi>Prov. 27. 17. As iron ſharpneth iron,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſo a man ſharpneth the countenance of his friend,</hi> that is, as the inſtrument which is ruſty, or edge dulled, is made ſerviceable by the file; ſo is one godly man quickned up by another. The Church is compared to a flock of ſheep, whereof every one brought twins, that is, their fruitfulneſſe, and <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. in the ſame Chapter, Chriſtian love is compared to Ointment and Perfume, which hath much ſweetneſſe and ſtrengthning in it; yea reproof is ſometimes neceſſary, as <hi>David</hi> witneſſeth, when he ſaid, <hi>Let the righteous ſmite me, and it ſhall be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then oil:</hi> yea this love is ſo farre commanded that ſometimes it's our duty to lay down our lives for the Brethren.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>This is ſeen in bearing their burdens, and forbearing their infirmities;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5. In bearing their burdens and forbearing their infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> Bearing their burdens; hence as members of the ſame body they are <hi>to weep with thoſe that weep, and rejoyce with thoſe that rejoyce.</hi> They are to be like the ſtrings of an inſtrument, touch one, and they all ſound; <hi>And forbearing infirmities,</hi> Gal. 6. 1. <hi>Ye that are ſpiritual reſtore ſuch an one;</hi> The word ſignifieth, <hi>Set him in joint again,</hi> as if a godly man overtaken by ſinne ſhould cauſe as much grief to the whole body, as a diſ-jointed member uſeth to do; So that to love the Brethren (if all things be conſidered) is a choice and difficult ſign of grace; it is not every one that is thus affected. Now here is a proper Queſtion, Whether if Brethren be fallen into hereſies and wicked errours, it be not againſt the love of brethren, to ſet againſt them, to endeavour the ſuppreſſion of them? And certainly the matter may be ſo carried, as thou maieſt diſcover not only an hatred of their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, but their godlineſſe alſo; again it may be ſo, that thou maieſt moſt of all diſcover thy love to their godlineſſe, only hatred to their falſe doctrines: but this is a large field, and many things are to be ſaid to it, elſe we cannot give full ſatisfaction to the Point.</p>
                  <p>Now to all this there is an Objection made, <hi>Love of the Brethren,</hi> ſay they, <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                     <hi>cannot be a ſign of grace, becauſe if it be true love it muſt have all thoſe properties de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. <hi>Charity ſuffereth long, envieth not,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Now who doth not finde ſome envyings, ſome impatiencies?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Anſwer is eaſie. <hi>We are not ſeeking for perfect ſigns, but true ſigns;</hi> and if <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> we finde true ſigns we may gather much comfort, though ſeveral defects cleave to us. Wilt thou think there is no honey or milk in <hi>Canaan,</hi> becauſe <hi>Jebuſites</hi> and wilde beaſts are left there?</p>
                  <p>But again they object, <hi>Every ſect thinketh their ſect the true Brethren. Hence the Papiſt loves a Papiſt, thinking him a true Brother, and ſo men may comfort them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with falſe ſigns.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Anſwer is, <hi>True ſigns are indeed ſo, though men blinded and deceived are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by counterfeit.</hi> A true Pearl is judged to be true by a skilfull Artificer, and he knoweth he is not deceived; though the unskilfull takes much counterfeit pearl for true; ſo a man awake is ſure he is awake, although men in a dream think themſelves alſo awake, but are indeed deceived.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, They ſay, <hi>The Apostle ſpeaks this love as it is a ſign to others, not to our ſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the <hi>Antinomian,</hi> and <hi>Eſtius</hi> to this purpoſe, <hi>The Apoſtle ſpeaketh</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of the whole Church as it is a Society, not of every particular perſon.</hi> But as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle intends that every particular man ſhould love the Brethren, ſo he alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth this as an Argument, becauſe hereby every man in particular may be aſſured he is <hi>tranſlated from death to life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If love to the Brethren demonſtrate our ſpiritual life, then hatred, oppoſition, <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> ſcoffs and reproaches of ſuch, demonſtrate the actors therein to be of the devil.

And that he may the better awaken them herein, who were apt to dote upon empty and vain priviledges, he takes this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to cure them.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By way of conceſſion, he reckons up the priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges they enjoyed, which are divers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Thou art called a Jew;</hi> Whereas the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> formerly were called Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, after the captivity into <hi>Babylon</hi> they were called Jews, and in this they gloried, as among us ſome do in the name <hi>Christian.</hi>

                  <p n="2">2. He is ſaid to reſt in the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> as given by God to that Nation, which he had not done unto any other people, and he uſeth an emphaticall word; They made the Law that to them which Chriſt ſhould have been, a reſt to their wearied ſouls.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Thou makeſt thy boaſt in God:</hi> The Prophet ſpeaks of glorying in God as a duty: but here it is a ſinne, for they boaſted of him in a carnall, factious way, as their God; Even as the Heathen boaſted of their God, (or as the Turks of Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met,) or as the Apoſtle of ſome Corinthians, who when others were for <hi>Paul,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for <hi>Apollo,</hi> theſe were for <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is, they ſet up Chriſt in a way of party and faction againſt others.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Jew did know Gods will, for to him it was revealed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. He diſcerned the things that were excellent, or profitable, or differentt, or

convenient, for all this the word will bear, if he was inſtructed out of the Law, as it were catechized.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. He was confident of being a guide to the blinde, a light, an inſtructer, a tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, and that he had a form of the truth and knowledge of the law. The Apoſtle doth not take <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>In the ſecond place is the aggravation of their ſinne from theſe very preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, partly becauſe they ſinne againſt knowledge and conviction, partly becauſe their circumciſion and the like viſible ſigns of Gods favour did not at all profit without holineſſe, yea, an Heathen and a Jew without this became both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.</p>
                  <p>Hence in the third place he amplifieth this aſſertion by a diſtinction of a Jew, and of circumciſion, for it was the hardeſt Paradox and moſt offenſive to a Jewiſh ear, that could be, to ſay, circumciſion did not profit: for they ſo glo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> in it, that they were wont to ſay, it was equall to all the Commandements, and that heaven and earth could not ſtand if there were not circumciſion. The Apoſtles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is like an Axe laid to the root of the tree, it takes away the foundation of all their glory. There is (ſaith he) <hi>a Iew outwardly,</hi> that hath only <hi>circumciſion of the fleſh,</hi> and this is not really and properly a Jew, he is not a Jew, nor is this circumciſion ſaith the Apoſtle. 2. There is <hi>a Jew inwardly, a circumciſion in the heart,</hi> in the ſpirit, and this is a Jew, this is a circumciſion, and <hi>his praiſe is of God, not of man;</hi> God regards ſuch only. Now this is alſo very applicable to the times of the Goſpel, he is not a Chriſtian, that is one outwardly, nor is that Baptiſm which is of the fleſh but that which is inwardly and of the ſpirit. No viſible ſigns or du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in Chriſtianity profit, if a man walk not according to Gods Word.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Although men are very prone to reſt upon Church-priviledges, and viſible ſigns or</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This point deſerveth a lively diſcovery, becauſe it's the only prop and evidence of moſt Chriſtians for heaven; And whereas in other things they would judge a <hi>title</hi> without reality to be a miſerable comfort, to be titularly rich, and really poor. To have the name of health, and to be indeed diſeaſed and pained, herein they would judge it mockery; yet in religion they are ſtrongly contented to have the name and repute of Chriſtians, baptized perſons, profeſſors of Chriſts doctrine, and yet know not the power of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſe things, being like dead corpſe with ſweet flowers ſtrewed upon them. Therefore to explicate this neceſſary point conſider ſome things by way of foundation.</p>
                  <p>As firſt, <hi>We finde it ſuch a ſinne that generally the people of Iſrael were guilty of.</hi>

They thought ſuch <hi>viſible ſymbols</hi> of Gods preſence would preſerve them, though their lives were unreformed. Thus <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. The Prophets whole ſcope is to let them know, that all their ſacrifices and religious worſhip were but ſo much deteſtable abomination unto God. Thus it was alſo in the New Teſtament, how excellently doth our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our diſcover this point twice, <hi>Mat. 3. 9. Joh.</hi> 8 33. where the Phariſees whole ſupport was in their carnall priviledge, and our Saviour ſheweth notwithſtanding all this, <hi>they were of their Father the devil.</hi> Thus <hi>Gal. 5.

that is, the Jewiſh <hi>dispenſation,</hi> and the Goſpel <hi>dispenſation of Ordinances</hi> is made nothing, but a new creature; and certainly if Chriſt himſelf be no more to be born after the fleſh, much leſſe may any viſible Ordinances which are not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to Chriſt. Thus you ſee it was the Jews ſin.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, <hi>If you look over all Chrſtianity, you ſhall finde this the Catholick and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">This is the Catholike ſin.</note> 
                     <hi>univerſall ſin:</hi> whereby Chriſt and regeneration with powerfull godlineſſe is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neglected, and a fleſhly carnall confidence in the titles and Ordinances of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity eſtabliſhed; ſo that all thoſe expoſtulations which the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had in thoſe daies may be juſtly revived again, ſeeing thoſe ſinnes are revived: What circumciſion, and ſacrifices, and the Temple were to the Jews; the ſame are baptiſm, the Lords Supper, and frequenting our religious Aſſemblies: and as the Jews in the midſt of all their duties, had wholly laid aſide Chriſt and ſanctification, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o have generally Chriſtians now. Thus as the Apoſtle argued ſeverely, you that reſt in <hi>circumciſion,</hi> that reſt in the Law, you are fallen <hi>from Christ,</hi> you are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of <hi>the spirit,</hi> the ſame may be ſaid to formall proteſtants, you have turned all Goſpel-diſpenſations into externals meerly; and ſo are Chriſtians of the fleſh and not of the ſpirit: Ye are of <hi>Agar</hi> and not of <hi>Sarah,</hi> ye are not <hi>children of the Promiſe;</hi> Your being is not by the meer word and power of God, all power in nature, being in this reſpect but a dead womb, but only by carnall and externall badges, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 6, 7. ſee how admirably the Apoſtle diſcourſeth of this in the Jews caſe, and applies it to Chriſtians. Oh therefore take heed of this epidemicall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, be not dammed or troden down in this crowd.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>To demonſtrate the connaturality of this ſinne, obſerve how ingenious the fleſhly</hi>

                  <p>In the next place, while we give this explication, you muſt by way of caution <note place="margin">A caution to take heed of two other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treams.

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>To cry down the very being and uſe of theſe externall Ordinances,</hi> as being but forms, and the ſpirituall frame of the heart is made all in all. Thus there are blaſphemous Hereticks that cry down the Sacraments, the Miniſtry, yea, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture it ſelf, yea Chriſt himſelf, as being but formes, and we ought to have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God immediatly. But it is elſewhere to be ſhewed, that Chriſt hath appointed an externall form of communion in his Church, which conſiſteth in <hi>read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>preaching</hi> of the <hi>Word, Administration</hi> and <hi>receiving of Sacraments, Praier,</hi> and <hi>Church-government,</hi> and <hi>Cenſures,</hi> with a <hi>Miniſtry from him,</hi> all which are of a perpetuall inſtitution for the ſubſtantials of them, and to cry down theſe forms, which God hath appointed as means to beget and encreaſe grace, which are in the gracious uſe of them a ſolemn acknowledging and owning of God, is a <hi>Beelzebub</hi> errour as I may ſo ſay, and a <hi>falſe doctrine in the firſt magnitude:</hi> we are therefore to ſail between theſe extreams neither reſting upon Externals in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as enough without Chriſt, and regeneration, or on the contrary aboliſhing and neglecting the uſe of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>We are alſo deficient when although we doe not cry down formes wholly, yet we</hi>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:30767:66"/>
the firſt ſin was common: In theſe latter times, I fear the latter doth over-flow. The Remonſtrants, they ſay, that the doctrine which the Proteſtants deliver about the Sacraments is <hi>valdè ſuſpecta</hi> greatly ſuſpected by them of falſhood. And the Socinians they make them only commemorative of ſome former mercy: they deny any reall exhibition or encreaſe in grace thereby. Hence it is their expreſſion, As, ſay they, when the Iſraelites in eating of the Paſchall lamb, made thereby a commemoration of their deliverance out of Aegypt God did then beſtow no new mercy on them, only there was a remembrance of the old; ſo in the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per there is no new conveyance of any grace, but a remembrance of an old former mercy, but this cometh too ſhort: for thoſe Scripture-expreſſions 1 <hi>Cor. 10. The bread that we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt</hi> &amp;c. and in the very words of the inſtitution, <hi>Take, eat, this is my body,</hi> do evidently prove more then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> meer commemoration. The Scripture when men are apt to reſt upon Sacraments, ſpeaks contemptibly of them; <hi>Your Fathers ate Manna and died, Circumciſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth nothing, he that eateth unworthily eateth damnation to himſelf:</hi> but when it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the inſtitution and proper uſe of them, and not the ſubject receiving them, then it ſpeaks gloriouſly. Theſe things are premiſed by way of explication and caution.</p>
                  <p>In the third place let us conſider why people are ſo apt to reſt upon theſe as comfortable teſtimonies, and there are ſeverall reaſons. <note place="margin">Why people are ſo apt to reſt upon Church-pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges. 1. They give eaſe to a naturall conſcience.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Becauſe they being duties commanded, when performed, that gives ſome eaſe and comfort to a naturall conſcience.</hi> To be circumciſed was Gods command, To be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptized, to hear his Word, to receive Sacraments are duties injoyned by God, ſo that the very neglect of them is threatned with condemnation; now then when we are diligent to diſcharge all theſe, a mans conſcience hath not ſo much to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe him and condemn him, and we are apt to take any partiall eaſe and comfort of conſcience for a generall acquittance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>We are apt to reſt in theſe things becauſe they are eaſie to be done:</hi> Whereas the way of mortification is troubleſome and tedious to fleſh and bloud: Hence it's cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <note place="margin">2. Becauſe they are eaſie to be done.</note> 
                     <hi>crucifying the fleſh and cutting off the right hand,</hi> and pulling out the right eye. The Jews would bring multitude of ſacrifices, They would kill many bullocks and rams rather then any luſts. They would not ſacrifice themſelves or their luſts, yea, they proffered their <hi>firſt-born,</hi> when yet they would not leave their ſins. Oh beloved, the duty of mortification and powerfull godlineſſe is an hell to fleſh and bloud: <hi>Christianus eſt perpetua naturae violentia,</hi> and therefore few, ſet on that; whereas to come to Church, to hear, to pray, theſe are done without much trouble. Every naturall man had rather perform a thouſand religious duties, then crucifie one pleaſant or profitable ſinne: Oh then ſee upon what ſandy foundations you build all your hope, whoſe lives are not ſanctified, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Oh then it is in vain to pleade that, which many damned in hell have been partakers of. And whereas if true grace be in any man, though in the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, he can never be excluded; none can ſay, Lord did we not truly fear thy Name, reform our lives, walk ſpiritually? and yet God bid them Depart, he knoweth

them not. And that this ſad portion will be to the greateſt part of thoſe that have enjoyed thoſe pridiledges, appears by that fore-mentioned, <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen,</hi> which are not ſo much words, as <hi>thunder</hi> and <hi>lightning.</hi> Oh then think not theſe an Ark ſure enough to keep thee in the deluge of many waters.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Scripture reckons the condition of a man with theſe priviledges, and one with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. The Scripture goeth higher, and doth not only make them equal with <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi>

The Prophet <hi>Haggai</hi> alſo <hi>Hag.</hi> 2. doth by an excellent inſtance ſhew, That if a man be unclean and ſinful, his holy ſervices do not take off from his uncleanneſſe, but his uncleanneſſe defiles them. Oh therefore conſider, that thou haſt many dead flies fallen into this box of ointment, and therefore cannot be ſavoury unto God! Thy ſwearing tongue doth more offend God then thy praying tongue doth pleaſe him; Thy ſins will cry louder then thy prayers, yea God will anſwer thee according unto the abomination of thy Idols; he will anſwer thee not according to the duties thou art doing, but thy ſins thou haſt committed; he doth not look upon thee as one praying or hearing now, but as one unclean, dumb or vicious in ſome week-day. Oh why do your conſciences lie in ſuch a deep ſleep in your boſoms! Why doth not that Serpent in thy breaſt begin to hiſſe and ſting thee at the hearing of theſe things?</p>

becauſe of the very external profeſſion of Chriſt, and his wayes, though there be no internal change, many Church-priviledges belong to them, and Miniſters are bound to diſpenſe them to them, if they be without ſcandal: I grant alſo, as may be fully proved out of this Text, that there is an external and internal Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, a man may have a Church-holineſſe, a viſible ſanctity, whereby he and his children are intituled to Ordinances, although all this while there be no true grace in that man. But now we are ſpeaking of the promiſes of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and ſalvation, and theſe are made to none but to the truly godly.

Oh therefore that theſe things were more conſidered by you: Suppoſe you hear God ſpeaking from Heaven to you; Why are you weeds in my garden? Why are you Tares in my Wheat?

Yea, think thou ſeeſt an hand-writing on every wall of thy Houſe, and poſt of thy doors, like that of <hi>Belſhazzars:</hi> Thou art numbred and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and found too light: All thy religious profeſſion, Ordinances, are found too light.</p>

                  <p>OUr Saviour in this verſe, and that going before, removeth two foundations that believers are apt to build their hopes upon,</p>
                  <p>The Firſt is a bare name, and profeſſion of Chriſtianity, without the real power of it, whoſe inſufficiencie we have already diſcovered. <hi>Nomen ſine actu &amp; officio, nihil est,</hi> ſaid <hi>Salvian,</hi> ſpeaking to this purpoſe, Chriſtianity in a prophane life, is <hi>ornamentum in luto,</hi> a jewes in a dunghil.</p>
                  <p>The Second weak and rotten foundation is in my Text, and that is, <hi>Gifts, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent abilities beſtowed upon Christians:</hi> and theſe ſeem to be a very ſtrong Pillar, and Prop. But our Saviours aſſertion about the unſoundneſs of it, is very terrible, and yet very neceſſary to theſe times: wherein men are like trees that ſpread out into many branches, but have little or no root.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In the words you have the deſcription of their confidence, in that phraſe, <hi>Lord, Lord:</hi> which argueth not onely <hi>vehemency,</hi> but <hi>boldneſs,</hi> and as if accuſtomed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly to call on God as their God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is the ground of their confidence, <hi>Have not we Propheſied in thy name, and in thy name caſt out Divels, and in thy name done many wonderful works?</hi> Thoſe Expoſitors that think they lyed in ſaying thus, as if no wicked men were made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of ſuch wonderful gifts of the Holy Ghoſt as here are ſpecified, attend not to other places of Scripture: neither is that diſpute neceſſary, whether they were true miracles that they wrought? or did indeed caſt out Divels? For ſeeing theſe <hi>Gifts</hi> were given for the good of the Church, and not of thoſe that enjoyed them, there is no ground to deny the truth of their miracles. Only obſerve how they lay much upon this, That all they did was in <hi>Gods name,</hi> which they thrice repeat: That is, at the command of God, having authority from him, and by his power adminiſtred unto them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. This is aggravated by the number of thoſe who ſhall be in this fruſtrated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: <hi>Many,</hi> not <hi>One</hi> or <hi>Two,</hi> but <hi>Many ſhall ſay.</hi> Laſtly, Here is the time when the weakneſs of theſe foundations will be diſcovered, <hi>In that day,</hi> viz. <hi>at the great day of judgement, when all hidden things ſhall be diſcovered:</hi> Implying, that they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and died with great confidence that God was theirs, but never were convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of their deceit therein till it was too late.

                  <p>At the day of judgement when the <hi>fiery trial</hi> ſhall be, all this painting will melt away. For the opening of this point, let ſome things be conſidered by way of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>There are parts and abilities of two ſorts:</hi> The one <hi>Humane</hi> and <hi>Natural,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Explicatory conſiderations. 1.</note> the other <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Spiritual.</hi> Natural parts, are all thoſe excellent abilities ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by induſtrie, and through the diſcipline of others, though even thoſe Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral gifts come from God alſo. In this kind the Heathens have wonderfully excelled, and many of the Fathers converted to Chriſtianity, were before their converſion, admirable in humane learning. <hi>Qui dedit Petrum Piſcatorem, dedit &amp; Cyprianum Rhetorem.</hi> He that called <hi>Peter</hi> an illiterate <hi>Fiſherman,</hi> called <hi>Cyprian</hi> alſo a great <hi>Rhetorician.</hi> Thus <hi>Tertullian, Origen, Auſtin, Hierom,</hi> and others, came into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan, the Church of God,</hi> loaded with <hi>Egyptian gold,</hi> I mean filled with humane learning: ſo that, that fooliſh aſſertion by ſome in theſe daies, that God never ſanctifieth humane learning, expungeth at once all thoſe glorious Lights out of the heavenly Firmament. It is true indeed, take theſe natural endowments in the heart, while carnal, they work a ſinful pride, and tumour, againſt the ſimplicity of Gods waies. Hence <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpake of himſelf, <hi>Dedignabar eſſe PARVULUS,</hi> I ſcorned to become like a little Child, and to admire the Scriptures. Thus alſo <hi>Bradwardine,</hi> called <hi>the profound Doctor, uſque ad ſtuporem,</hi> even to amazement, profeſſeth of himſelf, <hi>That when he heard</hi> Pauls <hi>Epiſtles read, he was much diſspleaſed, becauſe</hi> Paul <hi>had not</hi> Metaphyſicum ingenium, <hi>a Metaphiſical wit.</hi> And certainly when Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural parts come like <hi>Hagar,</hi> to quarrel with <hi>Sarah,</hi> Gods Truth, then throw her out of dores; otherwiſe if ſubordinated, they are great helps. But ſecondly, there are ſpiritual Gifts, ſuch as the Spirit of God doth more immediately work in his Church, of which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh largely, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. Now the Spirit of God is the Author of two kind of gifts; the one <hi>Sanctificantia,</hi> Sanctifying and ſaving, ſuch as Faith, Hope, Love, Repentance: The other <hi>Miniſtrantia,</hi> or Gifts of <hi>Miniſtration,</hi> becauſe they are wholly for the ſervice of the Church: The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer are called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the latter <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, though the Scripture doth not alwaies fully diſtinguiſh theſe two words: the Schoolmen by <hi>Diviſion</hi> call the former Graces, <hi>Gratos nos facientes,</hi> making us acceptable to God; and the other Graces, <hi>Gratis datae,</hi> freely given. But this diſtinction is firſt abſurd, becauſe coincident; for thoſe graces which (they ſay) make us acceptable to God, are alſo freely given: And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly its falſe; for true Grace is called Grace, not becauſe it maketh us gracious and acceptable to God, but becauſe it floweth from the grace of God. Now theſe gifts of ſervcie in the Apoſtles time, were more immediately vouchſafed by the Spirit, and more univerſally, inſomuch that its made a promiſe, <hi>Mark 16. 16. 17. Even to every believer, that great ſigns and wonders ſhould follow him:</hi> Thus the Church of <hi>Corinth, 1 Cor.</hi> 14. by reaſon of her eminent and various Gifts, <hi>ſeemeth to be like the Queens daughter, all in gold and curious needle-work.</hi> In theſe latter daies God alſo doth beſtow upon men, not immediately, but mediately in the way of ſtudy and uſe of means, many ſpiritual Gifts, ſuch as the gift of Prayer, the gift of Preaching, great aſſiſtance in the exerciſe of theſe, with inlargement of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections therein: and theſe are much admired as arguments of their holineſs and piety: but the Apoſtle told the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he had a more excellent way to ſhew them then that of Gifts, which was the way of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The end of all theſe spirituall abilities, is to profit the Church with them.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:30767:69"/>
They are not for vain oſtentation, diſputes, and applauſe in the world, but merely to edifie others. 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 7. The gift is given to every one,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>to profit with.</hi> So then theſe gifts muſt not be put under a buſhel; theſe Talents muſt not be <hi>Hid in the earth,</hi> or <hi>wrapt up in a napkin,</hi> as if it were a dead thing. It is ingeniouſly obſerved by <hi>Theophylact, That when men were dead, they covered their faces with a napkin, and laid them in the grave:</hi> Thus they did to Chriſt, and to <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus:</hi> and thus the unprofitable ſervant did to his Talent, as if it were a dead thing and buried, he would make no improvement of it at all. And well did <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> call idleneſs, <hi>the burial of a man while alive: Paul,</hi> even then when he foretels his death ſhortly, <hi>That he muſt be a Sacrifice for the truth,</hi> he yet ſends for his Parchments, imploying that little time he hath in ſtudy. Now when I ſay gifts muſt be improved, I mean the gifts of private men in a private way out of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; of publick men, by office in a publick way out of Authority: for that gifts are not enough to entitle to a publick office, appeareth by the examples and commands in the Epiſtles, and in the Acts of the Apoſtles, where all that publickly imployed their gifts, beſides their own qualification, had alſo authority, and office given them by Superiours, whereby they were ſent to do their work: And as they are not to be negligent, ſo neither to uſe them for applauſe, or to get eſteem, or make parties. It is a ſad corruption in us that we affect gifts more then graces, as you ſee the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did, for which <hi>Paul</hi> reproveth them, becauſe by their gifts they were more admired and applauded: Hereupon they alſo had many followers, and truely this City of <hi>London</hi> is become much like <hi>Corinth:</hi> as ſhe gloried in light and knowledge, as ſhe abounded in ſchiſms, and parties, one for one, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for another: as her publick meetings were come to great confuſions and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, and as they minded diſputes, but neglected the true power of Grace, thus is it with <hi>London</hi> at this day.</p>
                  <p>In the next place let us conſider, Why Believers are ſo ready to lean upon theſe? To take Gifts for Graces, Enlargements and Aſſiſtances for San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe theſe do exceed the common way, and ordinary courſe of Chriſtians.</hi> Men ſo qualified and furniſhed, ſeem to be as much above ordinary Chriſtians, as <note place="margin">Why Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are apt to reſt upon parts. 1.</note> the call Cedars above the low ſhrubs: The Phariſees, how ſcornfully did they ſpeak, <hi>This people which know not the Law, are curſed.</hi> How apt is a man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he can pray excellently, diſcourſe upon many controverſies in religion, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue thoſe that cannot: Seeing therefore that theſe are in an higher form of Chriſts ſchool, and to the name and Title in knowledge of Chriſtianity, they have ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded many other Talents, is it any wonder they are confident of their good eſtate? We may read that in <hi>Auſtines</hi> time, it was a general received opinion, <hi>That every Chriſtian, though he lived wickedly, ſhould at laſt be ſaved.</hi> This Doctrine was ſo univerſal, that <hi>Austin</hi> was forced to oppoſe it with a great deal of fear and modeſty. They did not hold with <hi>Origen, That the very Divels themſelves ſhould be restored,</hi> nor with others mollifying <hi>Origens</hi> opinion, <hi>That all men whether Chriſtians or Infidels;</hi> nor as a third, <hi>That all Chriſtians, how damnably ſoever erring in matter of Faith, ſhall be ſaved;</hi> but thought it moſt reaſonable, <hi>That all right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Chriſtians ſhould find mercy whatſoever their wickedneſs was.</hi> Auſtin, <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chir. ad Sanc.</hi> ſaith, thoſe that hold ſo, <hi>Humanâ quadam benevolentiâ ſibi falli videri.</hi> And if the name and profeſſion of Chriſtianity may ſway ſo much, what then may theſe more excellent and unuſual workings of Gods Spirit upon men? wonder not therefore if you ſee a man that hath better gifts then another, more knowledge then another, have alſo more confidence in God then another. Not that indeed he hath grounds, for its better to ſpeak one word with Grace, then five hundred with meer Parts and abilities; but onely ſelf-love doth blind our Eyes, and deceive our Hearts, ſo that we do not judge Scripture-judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>A ſecond reaſon of carnal confidence herein, is, becauſe it is, very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:30767:69"/>
to know when our duties are performed by aſſiſtance meerly, and when by Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation alſo.</hi> In prayer it is hard to diſcern when its the Gift of prayer onely, and when its the Grace of prayer alſo; for theſe things are judged by the Spiritual man onely; he is ſaid <hi>to judge all things.</hi> But now an unregenerate man, though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in theſe gifts of Gods Spirit, yet becauſe he is altogether carnal, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make any ſpiritual diſcerning of theſe things: but as ſenſual bruitiſh men, they argue God loveth them, and that they are in the favor of God becauſe he bleſſeth them with wealth, and outward proſperity. Thus men of parts and abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in religious things argue; if God did not love them, if he intended to damn them, he would never give them ſuch knowledge, he would never give ſuch aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but this is a meer deluſion. Oh there is as vaſt a difference between thy Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties performed through aſſiſtance meerly, and through Sanctification, as is between ſweet Grapes and wilde Grapes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Therefore we do take theſe for ſure ſigns, becauſe hereby is demonſtrated Gods power in us, and we are ready to take his preſence by power, for his preſence of Grace.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> When we perceive in our ſelves a greater ſtrength then our own, we argue that God is with us, not onely providentially, but graciouſly, whereas theſe two are ſeparable one from another: God was with <hi>Saul</hi> by way of aſſiſtance &amp; power, when he gave him another ſpirit, but not by way of gracious inhabitation. There is no queſtion but Chriſts power was with <hi>Judas</hi> in his miracles, as well as with the other Apoſtles; but with <hi>Judas</hi> was onely a preſence of power, with the other Apoſtles, a preſence of power and gracious Sanctification: ſo then, God may be much ſeen by his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance in thy Duties, in thy Prayers, in thy Preaching: but his preſence in morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of ſin, and vivification to righteouſneſs is far more admirable. It is true, the times of the Goſpel, and of its Truth is in Scripture, proved by this argument, becauſe <hi>many wonders and ſigns were done amongſt them;</hi> for ſo it was promiſed, <hi>That Miracles ſhould abound in the time of the Meſſiah:</hi> but theſe are no ſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of the Spirit dwelling graciouſly among us. So then diligently conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thus, Thou findeſt God much with thee: thou feeleſt thou couldſt not do ſuch things as thou doſt; but here is no ſolid ground of comfort, unleſs thou diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt a further powerful work of his Spirit, which is in giving thee an holy, humble, believing, and ſelf-denying ſpirit. Oh its far more comfortable to find Gods power melting thy heart for ſin, quickening thee up to holineſs, then to finde ten thouſand enlargements in holy performances: It is better to ſee and feel God in thy converſation in the waies of mortification, then in any ſolemn Religious duty.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Therefore we reſt on theſe, becauſe we diſtinguiſh not between that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>which is Spiritual in the object, or matter we do, and that which is Spiritual in the manner how we do it.</hi> As for Example, The Phariſees, many things they did were Spiritual for the object matter: Thus their prayers, their reading and expounding the Scriptures, were ſpiritual imploiments, but take them for the manner how they did it, which was <hi>to be ſeen of men,</hi> to advantage worldly intereſts; and no Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, or Harlots were more carnal then they, ſo that the proper ſtream and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, wherein all their ſpiritual defilement did empty it ſelf, was in their religious duties, ſo that they were moſt carnal, when they ſeemed moſt Spiritual. <hi>Jehu</hi> alſo is a clear inſtance, if you reſpect the outward matter; his reformation from I dola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, his eſtabliſhing the worſhip of God, all this was wonderful Spiritual; but withall conſider, that his aims were meer State-Policy in all he did, and ſo he was very carnal: conſider therefore of this more then thou haſt done: it may be thou waſt never more ſinful; corruption did never more diſcover it ſelf then in thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual abilities and imployments. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of ſome, <hi>That they preached Chriſt out of envy,</hi> and others may do it out of worldly ends: now becauſe the Duties are Spiritual, ſhall we ſay theſe men are Spiritual men: No, they are ſenſual, corrupt, and worldly: and this is certain, when the Divel cannot perſwade men to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in vicious and prophane courſes, then he becomes like an Angel of light,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:30767:70"/>
and ſeduceth them to carnal diſtempers in ſpiritual duties.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, <hi>Therefore are we prone to rely on theſe, becauſe they breed eſteem in the hearts</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5</note> 
                     <hi>of others.</hi> Many times Diſciples that are followers, they ſet up a Doctor or Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher as if he were an Angel: they place him among the <hi>Cherubims</hi> and <hi>Seraphims:</hi> they ſay by his gifts and abilities, their ſouls have got a world of good: they have cauſe to bleſs God that ever they ſaw him, or heard him: Now theſe ſolemn ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations from others, do work great confidence in ſuch a mans heart. I make no queſtion but a man of abilities may do good by them, although he himſelf be naught; otherwiſe the Apoſtle would not have rejoyced <hi>that ſome preached Chriſt out of envy:</hi> neither would Chriſt have remitted his Diſciples to the Scribes and Phariſees Miniſtry as he did, when he bid them <hi>hear them as long as they ſate in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his chair, deliver true Doctrine from the Scriptures.</hi> Now this being ſo, it is hard to perſwade our ſelves that when we have been a means to bring in ſome Elect ones, we our ſelves ſhould be as Reprobates: hence it is that the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. preſſeth men ſo to walk, <hi>That they may have approbation from God and their own conſciences, rather then from others,</hi> when it is ſaid, <hi>That thoſe who convert others to righteouſneſs, ſhall ſhine like the ſtars in heaven,</hi> that is to be underſtood taking in other places of Scripture, <hi>viz. If they be Godly, and walk in all the waies of God themſelves, as well as teach others ſo to do.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the reaſons why people are apt to take all their evidences for Heaven from theſe uncertain grounds; now let us demonſtrate the inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of theſe to give any ſollid ſupport: and this will appear ſeverall waies.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In that all theſe glorious abilities are, and may be conſiſtent in the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject at the ſame time, with prophane and ungodly waies of iniquity.</hi> Now can you call that light which agreeth with darkneſs? Can that be righteouſneſs, which may conſiſt with unrighteouſneſs? You heard, <hi>He that is born of God ſinneth not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that ſeed in him.</hi> Then certainly this is not that Spiritual ſeed, if we have, or may have at the ſame time an habitual inclination to evil. It is true indeed, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying grace is in the ſame ſubject with the reliques of co rruption; and a Godly man hath darkneſs in him as well as light: and we know in Philoſophy, that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traria poſſunt ſimuleſſe in gradu remiſſo, ac dum ſunt in pugna,</hi> contraries may be together in a remiſs degree, and while they are in conflict: But in theſe ſpirituall abilities and gifts, ſin may be in its dominion and prevalencie with full quietneſs and caſe. Hence our Saviour calls theſe Prophets, theſe wonder-workers, <hi>Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of iniquity.</hi> They were ſo at that very time while they did all theſe: alas, it was no advantage to caſt the Divel out of other mens bodies, while he had full poſſeſſion in their own hearts. Know then if theſe abilities were Grace, they would expel at leaſt in ſome degree, all thoſe luſts and exorbitances that are in thy life. Experience telleth us, that it is no new thing for men to pray zealouſly, to perform duties admirably, and yet to go from theſe duties to the committing of ſin againſt the light of nature, as well as of the Scriptures. Did not <hi>Judas</hi> practiſe ſecret the every and injuſtice, notwithſtanding his publick miniſtry? It is true, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times God in a juſt judgement, when men live prophanely, doth at laſt take away their Talents: they cannot pray, they cannot preach as they have done; but they become very ſots: even as in the black Coal-mine there ſometimes ariſe ſuch damp vapours that put out all the light, yea, and the breath of thoſe men that are in it; but for a great while they may keep their Talent, and it not be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Theſe cannot be a ſure teſtimony for our comfort, becauſe they are not proper and immediate effects of election, which is the firſt round in that ladder of all ſpiritual mercies.</hi> If I have juſtifying faith, I may have ſure confidence, becauſe this is a fruit of our ordination and appointment to eternal life. But we cannot ſay thus of theſe parts and abilities; for the Text ſaith, <hi>Many ſhall ſay, have not we propheſied in thy name,</hi> yet Chriſt ſhall reply, <hi>I never know you:</hi> but there ſhall not one godly man
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:30767:70"/>
ſay at the day of judgement, <hi>Lord, was not I elected? was not I converted? Did not I repent, believe, mortifie ſin, &amp;c?</hi> And Chriſt ſay again, <hi>Depart, I know you not.</hi> If therefore our calling and election might be made ſure by theſe gifts and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, there might be ſome hope, but that cannot be; therefore how fully doth our Saviour ſpeak to this purpoſe, when the Diſciples came rejoycing to Chriſt, telling him, <hi>That the Divels were ſubject to them, and they could work all kinde of wonders,</hi> he replyeth, <hi>Rejoyce not in this, but that your names are written in heaven:</hi> where you ſee how prone we are to rejoyce in that which affords no good ground of comfort, and withall, That if we had the parts and abilities of men and Angels, yet if we had not <hi>our names written in heaven,</hi> we were in a miſerable condition. Oh then ſay, This is but the fruit of the Common Love of God: the ſons of the Concubine may have this, as well as the ſons of the true wife: <hi>Abraham</hi> gave <hi>Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi> ſome gifts, but they were not ſuch as <hi>Iſaak</hi> had; therefore pray that God would give thee tokens of ſuch a love which is vouchſafed unto his own people in a peculiar manner.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Theſe cannot demonſtrate certainly The faith of the Elect Paul</hi> calls it, <hi>our good eſtate,</hi> becauſe God in the beſtowing of theſe gifts, doth not at all look to the good of him that hath them, but to the good of the Church. There is this difference between ſaving Gifts, and Gifts of ſervice: ſaving Gifts, ſuch as Faith, Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are intentionally given to the good of him that hath them; and although a man by theſe may edifie others, yet that is not looked at primarily; but now in theſe gifts of ſervice, ability to pray, preach, and confer or diſpute, theſe are given not primarily for the good of him that hath them, but of the Church in general. As a nurſe to a great mans child liveth upon dainty fare, not for her own ſake, but the childs ſake: Now then thou ſhouldeſt thus argue, Is God much in aſſiſting of thee in praier, in any duties with others? ſay, <hi>Surely the Lord did thus aſſiſt me, not out of any respect to me, but he had ſome child of his there to be refreſhed, to be enflamed, or quickened by me:</hi> Hence for want of a godly life, many that have helped others to Heaven, they themſelves are thrown into Hell; they are Torches, which while they give light to others, they themſelves are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>That cannot be the true and proper good which may be turned into evil. Bonum eſt, quo nemo male uti potest,</hi> Grace and godlineſs cannot be uſed to an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil end, becauſe its part of Godlineſſe to rectifie the end, the ſhew of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe indeed may. But now all theſe abilities are ſo indifferent in their nature, that they may be uſed well or ill: As <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid of riches, <hi>That God doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times beſtow them upon wicked men, to ſhew they are not good in their own nature; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſometimes on good men, to declare they are not bad in their nature.</hi> Thus it is of all parts and abilities, they ſometimes are beſtowed upon good men, ſometimes upon bad men, to teach us, That as the ſubjects are in whom theſe be, ſo may they be imployed: But we cannot ſay ſo of Grace: no wicked man hath any true ſaving Grace in him: Why then do you encourage your ſelves with that which a <hi>Judas</hi> may have? one roaring in hell may have? And certainly theſe abilities and Gifts are in more perſons made a ſnare to evil, then an occaſion to good. Satan is more buſie to Tempt ſuch: when the Divel firſt aſſaulted <hi>Eve,</hi> it was by the Serpent, as an inſtrument that was more ſubtile then all the beaſts of the field: Thus afterwards he worked, when Satan ſeduced others by <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian,</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> he was a Divel in the Serpent. When thy Liquor boyleth, then look to take off the Scumme: and ſo when thy Abilities and Enlargements are efficacious and fervent, then take heed of froth and vanity. <hi>Ornari abs te Diabolus quaerit,</hi> ſaid <hi>Auſtin</hi> to a great ſcholar yet unconverted to Chriſt. The Apoſtle in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. and 14. ſpeaks of other carnal effects of ſpiritual abilities, as to puffe up and inflate, to make diviſions and ſeverall parties in Gods Church, to bring all into confuſion and diſorder, therefore theſe cannot be grace.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The Apoſtle maketh a man that hath all theſe abilities, yet if without
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:30767:71"/>
grace, to be no more then a tinkling Cymball, that may make a pleaſant noiſe for the while to the ear, but preſently paſſeth away, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1. And thus are all men of parts and gifts, they may be like a pleaſant Song to others, but they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have no benefit: Men may preach well, expound Scriptures, write excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Comments, yet for all this, be but like Harps or Viols, that give a melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſound to others, but perceive none of it themſelves; Whereas true grace is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to him that hath it, it watereth his heart in whom it is, and makes it fruitfull: It beginneth an heaven in this life, yea, ſtrangers and others, are not able to enter into his joy.</p>
                  <p>Uſe of Exhortation, Not any longer to look upon theſe gifts and abilities, as the moſt excellent things, but be perſwaded there is a better way, and deſire that. This aſſiſtance is like the rain that God vouchſafeth to the bad, as well as to the good: Only thy condemnation will be the more terrible, by how much thou wert the moreſecure of heaven, and yet didſt miſs it: thoſe men urged they had propheſied and wrought miracles in Chriſts name: but alas, the prophane and ungodly man, what will he ſay? We have been drunk in thy Name, unclean in thy Name: how abſurd and blaſpheming would this be? Therefore minde the things of mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation more then of parts and aſſiſtance; ſay now, I know God will and doth love me indeed, when he makes me fruitfull in all holineſſe.</p>

I look upon this point as fundamentall in practice; and which if true, may ſtrike like an arrow into our hearts, and therefore have brought undeniable places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to aſſert this truth; Affections in holy adminiſtrations with delight and joy, may be in thoſe who yet have no true grace: I will inſtance only in another affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and that is ſorrow and grief about ſinne, even this may be in a man unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with grace, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 3. it is expreſly ſaid of <hi>Judas,</hi> he repented himſelf and confeſſed I have ſinned in betraying the innocent bloud, <gap reason="foreign">

Now it's remarkable, as the Scripture cals theſe actions, repentance, humiliation, returning and ſeeking after God, giving the name of grace to them, becauſe they have the outward lineaments of grace, ſo alſo the Scripture attributeth pardon of ſin and forgiveneſſe unto them, <hi>verſ.</hi> 38. he being full of compaſſion forgave their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 20.

By all this you ſee the Scripture ſpeaking of ſome, as rejoycing in that which is good, and mourning for that which is evill, whereupon their ſins are ſaid to be forgiven, that yet all this while are men whoſe hearts are not right within them: and this is no wonder, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they are ſaid to beleeve, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. they beleeve for a ſeaſon, yea, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 23. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted men are ſaid <gap reason="foreign">

Certainly the fooliſh Virgins were ſuch Chriſtians as did live and die with temporary faith and affections to God, that had a lamp and ſhining, and ſo ſome oil, elſe their lamp could not ſhine, but not ſuch ſtore as would hold out: ſo then, theſe affections and motions of thy heart, may be all the pillar thou leaneſt upon, when yet many damned in hell have gone as far.</p>

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:30767:73"/>
arrived as farre as we ought to be. Indeed it will be eaſily granted, for a man to hear, pray, or beleeve the Word of God without ſome inward affections thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he may be judged <hi>a cloud without water, a tree without fruit:</hi> but when this oyl runneth from the head to the inferiour parts, then may we not ſay All is well. But <hi>Balaams</hi> conſideration of the good eſtate of the righteous, wrought in him affections to have ſuch an end as they have.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We are prone to make theſe all in all, becauſe <hi>affections are ſenſible and we feel them moving of us:</hi> Now we are affected and confirmed moſt by things of <note place="margin">2. Becauſe of the ſenſible moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> ſenſe. The reaſon why a godly man findeth it ſo hard to live by faith, is becauſe we have ſo much of ſenſe in us, and it is no mean work not to judge according to what we feel. Therefore that man who is in a falſe way, whether of doctrine, worſhip, or life, and yet findes comfort and conſolation therein, is in a very ſad and dangerous condition. The devil transforming himſelf into an Angel of light, of joy and comfort, doth the moſt incurably deſtroy. It is no good Argument I have comfort in this way, therefore it is of God, but let it be firſt diſcovered to be of God, and this will breed ſound comfort.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Therefore are we apt to rely on this moſt, <hi>becauſe this doth look moſt like grace;</hi> Of all falſe ſigns theſe do come neareſt. Temporaries are affected al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt with the ſame feeling as the truly godly are, inſomuch that ſome have thought (though falſly) the difference is only in degrees: ſo that it is eaſier to convince men of the unſoundneſſe and weakneſſe of all ſigns rather then of this, although men have therefore the greater cauſe to fear herein, rather then any where elſe.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in the next place conſider, <hi>Why theſe affections are not to be looked upon as ſuch an Ark that will ſave, when the deluge ſhall overflow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And firſt, <hi>Theſe motions argue only Gods spirit, working in thee, not dwelling in thee.</hi> Now the godly they are <hi>the temples of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> and being members of Chriſt they are animated with the ſpirit of Chriſt not only <hi>aſſiſting</hi> but <hi>informing.</hi> The Spirit of God in a temporary is like an Angel appearing in ſome outward ſhape or body; there was an eating, a drinking, but the Angel was only a form aſſiſting not informing that body: therefore the bodies they aſſumed did not live, neither were they nouriſhed, or could grow by all the food they took, but the Spirit of God is in a godly man like the ſoul in the body. I do not ſpeak of a <hi>perſonall union,</hi> as if they made up one, as the ſoul and body do one man, but of a <hi>morall union,</hi> or a <hi>union myſticall</hi> by faith, with a conſtant inhabitation. A woman may have many expreſſions of love from a man, but yet not preſently ſuch as give a conjugall affection, Therefore thou canſt draw comfort from thoſe things only which argue the ſpirits inhabitation, not the Spirits motion or operation.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A ſecond ground is in the Text, <hi>There are better things in the way of Heaven then theſe.</hi> Now we can take comfort in nothing but that which is the beſt work for its kinde, of Chriſt in us. There are better things then praying, hearing, with ſome affections; and that is a renovation of the heart, a deep radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of grace in thy ſoul: Whereas now if we ſpeak of the ſaving graces in the godly, it would be abſurd to ſay <hi>we hope better things,</hi> then truly to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in Chriſt, really to mortifie ſinne.

                  <p>Laſtly, (becauſe more of this in another place) <hi>They are not things that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company ſalvation:</hi> If a man had the higheſt degree of temporary faith, temporary joy, yet no promiſe of juſtification or ſalvation is made to ſuch a perſon: There are great promiſes made to the beleever, to him that rejoyceth in the Word of God, but they are not to be underſtood of a temporary faith, or a temporary joy: he that goeth no further then theſe, hath no promiſe in all the Scripture to comfort himſelf by: whereas the leaſt degree of true faith and ſincere joy, may with all boldneſſe apply the promiſe.</p>

The diſpute was about the obſervation of ſome legal rites, Whether this was abrogated by evangelical liberty, ſome were for the affirmative, ſome for the negative, and the conteſt groweth ſo high, that they make the ſumme and ſubſtance of Religion to lie in theſe things. Now the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle his ſcope is to rectifie them by ſeveral excellent rules, ſome whereof are to uſe our liberty alwaies with reſpect to our weak brother, To judge charitably of one another in theſe differences, not unſeaſonably to trouble the Church with our particular opinions, but to keep our faith to our ſelves; in which reſpect <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> ſaid, God would have us <hi>confiteri fidem,</hi> rather then <hi>profiteri,</hi> He <hi>confeſſeth it</hi> that is demanded and called thereunto, he <hi>profeſſeth</hi> that doth it ultroneouſly, without any invitation at all. And in my Text the Apoſtle giveth an excellent rule. The marrow and eſſence of godlineſſe lieth not in theſe things, though ye are apt to make theſe the pillars and foundations of Religion, yet they be not.</p>
                  <p>So that in the words you have a <hi>Propoſition expreſſed;</hi> firſt <hi>Negatively,</hi> and then <hi>Poſitively.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Propoſition</hi> you have,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The <hi>Subject, The Kingdom of God.</hi> This is in other places called <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> not <hi>reſpectu loci,</hi> in reſpect of the place where it is, for it is exerciſed on the earth, but <hi>reſpectu modi,</hi> becauſe it is adminiſtred after an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly manner. It doth in the general ſignifie that Regiment and Government which God exerciſeth, either of glory in the Heavens, or of Grace in the hearts of his people; and by a <hi>Metonymy of the Adjunct for the Subject,</hi> it ſignifieth the <hi>Church,</hi> Mat. 13. 41. and by a <hi>Metonymy</hi> of the <hi>Effect</hi> for the <hi>efficient Cauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental,</hi> it ſignifieth the <hi>preaching of the Goſpel,</hi> Mat. 13. 33. and by a <hi>Synecdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che</hi> of the <hi>genus</hi> for the more <hi>excellent ſpecies,</hi> it ſignifieth that peculiar time of renovation and reſtauration which was made in the Church by Chriſt and the Apoſtles, <hi>Matth. 3. 2. Mark 1. 14. The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> Hence the Kingdom of Heaven is never uſed in the Old Teſtament, but in the <hi>times of the Meſſias only.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is the <hi>attribute, 1. Excluſively, It is not meat or drink,</hi> that is, it conſiſteth not in the doctrinal opinions, in the different practice about theſe things. 2. <hi>Affirmatively</hi> and <hi>Poſitively,</hi> but this Kingdom of grace is in <hi>righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,</hi>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:30767:75"/>
an univerſal conformity to Gods will, <hi>in peace, viz.</hi> with others, and <hi>in joy in the holy Ghoſt, viz.</hi> a godly joy in the exerciſe of all grace, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the ſenſe of Gods favour and love in the Goſpel, which is wrought in us by the holy Ghoſt, for <hi>Joy</hi> is reckoned among others <hi>the fruit of the Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That doctrinal diſputations and difference of judgements in matters of Religion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> 
                     <hi>be relied upon as ſymptoms and evidences of Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Even the ſtrong Chriſtian who had the truth of his ſide, could not prove his godlineſſe from his opinion or practice in this controverſie, becauſe the Kingdom of God conſiſted not in theſe things. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh the like in another diſputation, that did much exerciſe the godly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 8. about <hi>eating things offered to Idols.</hi> But meat <hi>commendeth us not to God, for neither if we eat are we bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, neither if we eat not, are we the worſe.</hi> The Greek words are emphatical, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, we do not <hi>abound,</hi> we have done no ſuch great matter, neither <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> do we <hi>fall ſhort of others,</hi> as if we were not ſo excellent. Thus alſo the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb. 14. 9. It is good</hi> (that is better) <hi>to have the heart eſtabliſhed with grace, rather then meats,</hi> rather then Doctrines and Diſputations about them; where you ſee Diſputations and Opinions do not eſtabliſh, are not the ſtaff of a mans heart; Grace only is ſo. Yea the Apoſtle in that grand controverſie which did ſo much exerciſe the Church at firſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Diſputation about Circumciſion, and the obſervation of it, ſpeaketh manifeſtly, <hi>Gal. 6. 15. In Jeſus Chriſt neither Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion or uncircumciſion availeth any thing, but a new creature.</hi> Let not therefore men for a particular opinion which they conceive truer then others, boaſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, appropriate godlineſſe only unto that way. Although we are very prone to do ſo, yet the Scripture diſcovers ſuch arguments to be only broken reeds.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Explication</hi> of this, conſider theſe things; <note place="margin">Explicatory conſiderations. 1. Sound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is the foundation of godlineſſe.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That true and ſound Doctrine is the foundation of godlineſſe.</hi> There cannot be a godly life where there is not a true faith; hence the Scripture makes <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi> to conſiſt in <hi>Illumination</hi> in the firſt place, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 23, 24. There muſt be knowing before there can be doing; you muſt not therefore extend this to all Doctrines even fundamental in Religion, as if the believing of Jeſus Chriſt to be God, believing the Scriptures to be the word of God, were nothing, no <hi>without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> Therefore to ſuppoſe a man godly, and to be ſaved in any Religion or Opinion, is to deny that there are <hi>damnable hereſies,</hi> which yet the Apoſtle aſſerteth. Some have coyned a three-fold piety, <hi>Judaica,</hi> Jewiſh, <hi>Pagana,</hi> Heatheniſh, <hi>Chriſtiana,</hi> Chriſtian; but as the gold within the Temple was only holy, ſo is godlineſſe only within the true Church. This therefore is to be obſerved eſpecially in theſe times, where men are thought to have godly regenerated hearts, although they pertinaciouſly hold fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal errours; whereas the Apoſtle <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. reckoning up <hi>hereſies,</hi> as <hi>the manifeſt works of the fleſh,</hi> with other groſſe ſins, concludeth, <hi>He that doth theſe ſhall never inherit the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Although therefore orthodoxy be not preſently a ſign of the ſtate of grace, yet wilfull perſeverance in hereſie even as in adultery and drunkenneſſe, may make us conclude theſe are the fruits of the fleſh. Be therefore informed, that although ſound Doctrine be not neceſſarily godlineſſe, yet it is a neceſſary foundation to it. <hi>Ubi malè creditur, nec benè vivitur, A good Faith, and a good Conſcience,</hi> the Apoſtle couples together. And as the Spirit of God is called an <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> becauſe it worketh holineſs in his children, ſo it's alſo the <hi>Spirit of truth,</hi> becauſe it <hi>guideth them into truth;</hi> and firſt the Spirit of truth to them, before the Spirit of holineſs to them; hence the Scripture doth ſo often commend a <hi>ſound minde</hi> unto the godly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>There is a lawfull diſputation in matters of Religion, yea it is a duty</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Diſputations in matters of Religion law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times needfull.</note> 
                     <hi>ſometimes, when the Church is unſatisfied to have points of Religion throughly diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> Thus our Saviour did uſe many arguments to prove he was the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> yea <hi>tentativè</hi> did once argue againſt the truth, that the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was not the <hi>Sonne of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:30767:75"/>
David,</hi> becauſe he <hi>called him Lord,</hi> which was only to draw out his adverſaries the more. In like manner <hi>Act.</hi> 15. there was a famous Councel gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when Doubts in Religion troubled the Church, and in this Councel there was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>much diſputing;</hi> ſo at another time we reade of <hi>Paul,</hi> that he was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, proving out of the Scripture ſome truth; the word ſignifieth by a ſtrict comparing and knitting of one place to another. And for this reaſon it is that God doth ſuffer hereſies and falſe doctrines to be vented, that the truth may be more reſplendent, by having all ruſt filed off; As in times of perſecutions God doth exerciſe <hi>patientiam Eccleſiae,</hi> the patience of the Church; ſo in time of hereſies he doth exerciſe <hi>ſapientiam,</hi> the wiſdom and skill of the Church.</p>
                  <p>But now when we ſay, Diſputations in Religion are neceſſary, and ſometimes <note place="margin">Lunitations.</note> a duty, you muſt <hi>bound</hi> this ſeveral wayes. As</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>In the Object matter,</hi> if it be <hi>in matters uſefull and profitable.</hi> The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <note place="margin">I. As to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> condemneth diſputations meerly upon this, <hi>becauſe they profit not,</hi> though they do not ſo viſibly hurt and deſtroy, yet that is enough, if they do not profit. <hi>Diſputare</hi> is as much as to cut off ſuperfluous branches; Now if the diſputation it ſelf be a luxuriant branch, that muſt be cut off. The Scripture ſpeaks of the <note place="margin">It ought to be uſefull.</note> 
                     <hi>acknowledgement of truth after godlineſſe.</hi> All light in the underſtanding ought to produce heat and warmth in the affections.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>It must be in matters revealed in Gods word.</hi> We muſt not prie beyond thoſe <note place="margin">Revealed in the word of God.</note> things that are written. The Apoſtle condemneth ſome that did <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Go a tip-toe,</hi> like a man acting in a Tragedy, and arrogantly intruding into thoſe things he hath not ſeen. The Papiſts make a <hi>wicked Allegory</hi> of the <hi>beast that might not touch the mountain,</hi> when the Law was delivered, if it did, <hi>it was to die.</hi> This they apply to a Lay-mans reading of the Scripture; but we may better referre it to their Schoolmen, who though they were never wrapt up into the third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, yet write of Angels, as if they had been there.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>For the Manner, Diſputations ought to be wholly in reference to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">II. As to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Wholly in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</note> 
                     <hi>not in parties,</hi> to raiſe new ſects, to get victory, but wholly to increaſe in the power of godlineſſe, otherwiſe diſputations are but like much fretting, that eat away the fleſh of godlineſſe, and bring it into conſumption; and truly it is much to be lamented, to ſee how godlineſſe is decayed, mortification lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth, ſince ſo much quarrelling and wrangling in matters of Doctrine. It is reported of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> by <hi>Fuligattus</hi> in his life, <hi>Quod à ſtudiis Scholaſticae Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiae averteretur ferè nauſeabundus, quoniam ſucco carebant liquidae pictatis.</hi> He did with loathing turn from the ſtudy of School-Divinity, becauſe it wanted the juice of ſweet piety. All Religion is practical, it is food not to be looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but eaten and digeſted.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Subject ought alſo to be qualified, one who is able and wiſe, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">III. As to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. One that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandeth the ſtate of the Doctrine.</note> 
                     <hi>what the true ſtate of the Doctrine is, not a</hi> David <hi>in</hi> Sauls <hi>Armour.</hi> It's a miſerable thing to ſee how many diſpute about Univerſal Redemption, Free-Grace, Juſtification, Predeſtination, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who yet are no more able to wield thoſe Doctrines, then a Pigmy could <hi>Goliah</hi>'s Armour; we muſt not attempt things above our ſtrength. With theſe and many the like Qualifications, Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in matters of Religion are lawfull; ſo that in all theſe we do not manifeſt a <hi>ſceptical doubtfull heart;</hi> as if nothing were certain (which I am afraid is the temper of too many in theſe dayes) as if faith were not <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, a ſubſtance, evidence, perſwaſion and full aſſurance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>It will alwayes fall out, that even in the Church of God, there will be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. There will alwayes be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Church.</note> 
                     <hi>judgements and opinions, becauſe we know but in part, and are ſpiritual in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but in part.</hi> So that howſoever God hath promiſed <hi>to lead his children in to all truth,</hi> yet they are no more freed from all errour, then from all ſinne; and as the Spirit of God ſanctifying is more powerfull in ſome then in others; So alſo the Spirit of God enlightning and directing into truth, is more effectuall in
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:30767:76"/>
ſome then in others; ſome are <hi>Babes,</hi> others are <hi>Men;</hi> ſome are <hi>ſtrong,</hi> others are <hi>weak.</hi> And as <hi>we know in part,</hi> ſo being alſo ſanctified but in part; hence by different opinions we make ſeveral factions, <hi>One is of Paul, another of Cephas.</hi> And we are apt to monopolize piety, to incloſe it in ſuch a way. None godly, but thoſe that are of ſuch a judgement; and indeed if we ſpeak of fundamental Doctrines, this were lawfull, but in other matters that are ſuperſtructions onely, it is unlawfull. Thus the Papiſt, he makes it, <hi>De neceſſitate ſalutis, ſubeſſe Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mano Pontifici.</hi> The very refuſing his ſuperiority, is made a ſign ſure enough of damnation.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>There is great difference between Doctrines that are fundamental, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. There is great diffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     <hi>others that are not ſo.</hi> In that they are called fundamental, it's evident there can be no ſalvation, if they be denied. The Scripture cals ſuch truths <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>foundations,</hi> neceſſary to ſalvation, the Apoſtle cals them <hi>beggarly,</hi> and <hi>elements of the world,</hi> becauſe of their pride and ambition in maintaining of them; now there are Doctrines that are fundamental to faith, ſuch is the Trinity, Incarnation of Chriſt: Others that are fundamental to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and others that are fundamental to the worſhip; and it is a damnable thing obſtinately to deny any of theſe. Of ſuch opinions as theſe the Apoſtle doth not ſpeak in this 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> well obſerveth; no of ſuch the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>If an Angel from Heaven bring any other Doctrine, let him be an Anathema.</hi> But there are opinions that are <hi>acceſſaries not principles,</hi> that are not <hi>articuli</hi> or main parts of the body, and of ſuch properly we may ſay, <hi>The king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God doth not conſiſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Although it be not a neceſſary demonſtration of godlineſſe, yet it is a great</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5. It is a great mercy to be kept orthodox.</note> 
                     <hi>mercy of God to be orthodox, and to be kept in the right faith.</hi> Hence all errour and ignorance is deſcribed by the name <hi>darkneſſe,</hi> as truth is by <hi>light,</hi> to ſhew how dreadfull the one is, and comfortable the other is; The truth of God is ſo great that we ought to loſe our lives for it. Yea Chriſts death, though as it did reſpect Gods juſtice, it was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> a <hi>Propitiatory,</hi> yet as it did reſpect men, and the good confeſſion of faith he made, it was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> a <hi>Martyrdom.</hi> Hence are thoſe expreſſions, <hi>To contend earneſtly for the faith,</hi> Jud. 3. <hi>Not ſo much as to bid God ſpeed, to him that bringeth falſe Doctrines,</hi> 2 John 10. Hence alſo as a glorious gift, is the Spirit of God <hi>promiſed to teach us the truth,</hi> John 16. 13. Yea it's made the comfortable priviledge of the Elect, that though falſe Prophets ſhall prevail much, yet they ſhall <hi>not deceive the Elect,</hi> that is, totally and finally; and when the Apoſtle ſpake of the Apoſtaſie of <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> he addeth by way of comfort to the godly, <hi>Nevertheleſſe the foundation of the Lord ſtandeth ſure, knowing who is his.</hi> Bleſſed therefore is that man whoſe heart is kept in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual fear and trembling at errors and falſe waies, as well as at iniquities and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly practices.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Take this Caution in the laſt place, <hi>That although the life of Religion and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6. The leaſt truth ought not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied.</note> 
                     <hi>godlineſſe lieth not in every truth, yet we ought not to deſpiſe or contemn the leaſt truth or deny it. Paul withſtood Peter to the face,</hi> in an error that did not ſeem ſo great; in <hi>Paul</hi> you have an example of zeal, and in <hi>Peter</hi> of patience to bear it; for <hi>Genus quoddam non ignobile eſt Martyrii, reprehenſionem patienter ferre,</hi> It is a kind of glorious Martyrdom to receive a reproof patiently. Even the leaſt truth is ſo precious, that Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall ſooner paſſe away, then one iota or tittle of his word.</hi> Though truth for the matter of it may ſeem little, yet becauſe it is the truth of the great God, therefore it ought not to be neglected; ſome have called every truth ſo far forth as it comes to be made known fundamental, as if a man would neceſſarily be damned if he did not receive it. But certainly truth is called fundamental, not from the manner of revelation, or means of knowledge, but from the nature and uſe of it. <note place="margin">Why Doctrins though never ſo true, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next place, <hi>Conſider why Doctrines, though never ſo excellent and true are
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:30767:76"/>
not an infallible ſign of grace.</hi> And, Firſt, <hi>Becauſe enlightning the minde to receive truth, is but an introduction or antecedent, and that not a neceſſary one to godlineſſe,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Becauſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning the minde is no conſtitutive part of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> 
                     <hi>it is not a conſtitutive part of it.</hi> Hence it is that a man may be very orthodox and knowing of the truth, yea zealous for it, yet hating the power of godlineſſe in others, and refuſing to reform in his own life. The Scripture makes a difference between thoſe that know Gods will, and thoſe that do it. Boaſt not then of this that thou art among the orthodox, thou haſt not forſaken the truth, running af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe new errors; Thou holdeſt the truth in Juſtification, about the Law of God; thou art no Arminian, Socinian or Antinomian, all this is well. But this is not plea enough for ſalvation, and the judgement of diſcuſſion at that great day, will not be, How much good knowledge thou haſt had? What a good faith only, but what a good life alſo? Therefore if thou art gone no further then to the doctrinal part of Religion, thou haſt no ſure arguments of comfort within thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Seeing that corruption is in every part, not only blindneſſe in the minde,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. The cure is not perfect, by removing blindenes from the intellectual without change of the affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate part.</note> 
                     <hi>but contumacy and rebellion in will and affections, thou haſt no full cure upon thee, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe grace hath healed thy affectionate part as well as thy intellectual.</hi> If thy ſpiritual eyes be open, yet haſt no legs to walk in Gods Commandments, thou canſt never attain to the end of the way which is eternal happineſſe; ſo then think with thy ſelf, if I would ever have any true comfort about my ſpiritual eſtate, I muſt have a plaiſter as broad as my ſore, now not only my underſtanding was darkned with ignorance, errors, fooliſhneſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but my heart alſo with ſinfull and corrupt affections. Therefore if the grace of God do not give me a good heart, as well as a good head, I am ſtill undone. Hence the promiſe of Regeneration is not only expreſſed in words relating to the underſtanding, <hi>They ſhall all know God,</hi> and <hi>be taught of God,</hi> but in phraſes concerning the affectionate part, <hi>I will take away the heart of ſtone and give an heart of fleſh, and I will write my Law in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts.</hi> Examine then thy ſelf, whether the <hi>grace</hi> of God <hi>converting,</hi> is as <hi>univerſal and extenſive</hi> as <hi>ſinne infecting?</hi> For as an hand of a man, or an head of a man, is not a man; ſo neither is any particular revelation or illumination of the minde with faith, the whole image of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Know that orthodoxy or a right judgement is eaſier obtained then the reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. A right judgement is more eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained then a thorow reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note> 
                     <hi>of the other faculties of the ſoul.</hi> We are eaſier perſwaded to believe the truth, then to love the truth; How many times were the Phariſees convinced of the truth, and of the light, yet they could not love it, or delight in it? And as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philoſophy tels us, <hi>The underſtanding draweth the object to it,</hi> but in the will and affections the object draweth them to it; ſo that if a man loveth the earth, he is earthy; if he loves the luſts of the fleſh, he is fleſhly: but if a man underſtand or know that which is ſpiritual, he is not preſently ſpiritual; and this is the reaſon, why God and Angels do <hi>Scire malum,</hi> know evil, but they cannot <hi>velle malum,</hi> will that which is evil, becauſe the underſtanding abſtracts from all the imperfections of the object, as it is in its ſelf, but the object of the will draweth down the faculty to it, as it is in its ſelf. There is alſo another reaſon, why it is eaſier to know the truth then to love it, <hi>Becauſe the underſtanding is a meer paſſive faculty, and cannot refuſe the object of truth, when laid before it.</hi> But the will and affections are active and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, not neceſſarily carried out to their objects: and this is the reaſon why many a man believeth many a truth, which yet he hateth, and wiſheth it were falſe, becauſe the object works on the underſtanding irreſiſtably. And therefore till grace come and work ſo inſuperably and irreſiſtably upon the will alſo, it never boweth or yields to God. Oh therefore ſay, that beſides that general knowledge of the truth, and the zealous maintaining of it, there is neceſſary a further, more peculiar, particular, and operative way of grace upon thy heart. What is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that you may have many an orthodox man write many learned books againſt errors, yet know not the meaning of thoſe truths upon his heart? But onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe true Doctrin is not enough without a gracious alteration of the whole man,

A man may learnedly diſpute for the grace of <hi>Converſion</hi> againſt <hi>Arminians</hi> and others, yet not feel the power of converſion upon his own ſoul.

                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>That cannot be reſted upon as grace, which may breed pride, ambition,</hi>

                  <p>THe Apoſtle having aſſerted immediately before, in the verſe precedent of the former chapter, a true and ſure ſign of our ſtate of Grace, <hi>viz.</hi> The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and ſanctifying operations of Gods Spirit, by which the Spirit diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it ſelf, as the ſun doth it ſelf by its beams and heat, or as the rational ſoul manifeſts it ſelf by rational operations: He doth in this verſe regulate us in our proceeding about this ſign, advertiſing us not to be too credulous, or overhaſty in believing every thing that may ſeem to be of the Spirit. Where by the way you may ſee it's no good argument againſt the uſe and truth of ſigns, That men may be deluded, and think they have them, when they have them not: For the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle at the ſame time ſaith, <hi>We know that he abideth in us by the Spirit which he hath given us,</hi> and yet addeth, <hi>believe not every ſpirit,</hi> taking Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in both places <hi>Metonimically,</hi> the effects of the Spirit either real or pretended, for the efficient cauſe, the Spirit it ſelf: So that in the words you have <hi>a cautiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry admonition,</hi> ſet down</p>

                  <p>In the next place the duty is ſet down <hi>Poſitively, Try the Spirits,</hi> which is to be meant thus, by the word of God: for all tryal ſuppoſeth ſome rule by which the thing tryed is to be examined: and this duty is impoſed upon all believers, who though they have not a judgement of <hi>Deciſion,</hi> yet have of <hi>Diſcretion</hi> for their own ſelves.</p>

In the Third place you have the reaſon of this <hi>Examination, Becauſe many falſe Prophets are gone out into the world;</hi> Many who ſhall boaſt of the Spirit, and ſay, <hi>It lodgeth with them:</hi> And that we may be the better guided in this Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he layeth down one rule as it concerneth Doctrine, verſe 2. <hi>Hereby we know the spirit of God, if it confeſſeth that Jeſus Chriſt is come into the fleſh:</hi> which may be underſtood either largely, as acknowledgeing all matters that pertain ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the perſon and office of Chriſt; ſo that although we may acknowledge Chriſts incarnation; yet if we deny his offices, we offend againſt this rule, and ſo have the Spirit of Antichriſtianiſm, as in Popery; or elſe more ſtrictly, for that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate particular point of Chriſts incarnation; for though a man be heretical in other points, and ſo have the ſpirit of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> yet ſo far as it acknowledgeth this truth, it is of God. And thus <hi>Austin</hi> ſaid, <hi>Hereticks and Schiſmaticks are of the Church, ſo far as they hold any thing that is true and good: but wherein they are divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from truth, they are divided from the Church, and wherein they are united in truth, they are united to the Church.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>We may think indeed we have revelations, raptures, ſpiritual conſolations from the Holy Ghoſt, when we are all the while in great deluſions: this point deſerveth many things introductory for Explication.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The ſpirit of God doth in and by the word, comfort, aſſure, or inſtruct the ſoul ſo certainly, that the true believer is not, or cannot be deceived.</hi> Therefore the Scripture calls it, <hi>The teſtimony of the ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>the ſealing of the spirit:</hi> and it would be horrid blaſphemy to make the ſpirit of Truth, the ſpirit of Falſhood: Hence Faith, which is the work of Gods ſpirit, is called <gap reason="foreign">

It is true, this evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and perſwaſion cannot be made clear to another: and no wonder, for God giveth not this perſwaſion to aſſure others, but that heart in whom it is. Take we heed therefore, that becauſe there have been miſerable and ſad inſtances of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible deluſions by men boaſting of Revelations, and ſpiritual raptures, that we fall not into Atheiſtical, or Sceptical thoughts about the true works of Gods ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Therefore to make you afraid herein, it is an high ſin to attribute thoſe</hi>

Be therefore afraid how thou denieſt Gods work in thy ſoul, this is a greater ſin then thou thinkeſt of in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The Divel is Gods Ape, and imitates him in all thoſe waies or worſhip that God hath appointed.</hi> Hence there hath been no true way of God at any time, but <note place="margin">3. The divel af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to imitate God in all his appointments.</note> there hath alſo been a counterfeit way of Satan at that time.

There are falſe Apostle transforming themſelves into the Apoſtless of Chriſt; and no marvel, for Satan himſelf is transformed into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light.</hi> Thus whereſoever that Chriſt or the Spirit is in the Church of God, Satan hath his juglings and coſenings: and therefore as God is ſaid to have his <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>spirit.</hi> The ſpirit of God, is the ſpirit of Truth, and leadeth into all Truth: Now Satan hath his deluſions about Doctrines: hence come all thoſe Hereſies in the Church of God: As Chriſt hath his Apoſtles, and Paſtors in his Church, <hi>To build up in the moſt holy Faith;</hi> ſo the Divel hath his falſe Apoſtles, and his <hi>Inſtruments of darkneſs.</hi> Again the ſpirit of God is <hi>our comforter,</hi> and joy is a proper fruit of the Holy Ghoſt: Now the Divel by deluſions and ſuggeſtions, can fill the heart with much conſolation: hence he is called <hi>an Angel of light.</hi> Now light in the Scripture, ſignifieth not onely Truth, but joy and gladneſs: whence have thoſe joys and conſolations flown, which have been in thoſe that have been manifeſtly in Satans waies, but from Satan? Again the ſpirit of God doth perſwade, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolden the heart by believing againſt all diſcouragements whatſoever. Thus the Divel alſo doth imbolden, and harden a man in a falſe way, that he hath no fear at all. Hence the Divel is ſaid <hi>To fill Ananias his heart:</hi> that is, as learned <hi>De Deiu</hi> ſheweth by a parallel place out of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes, obfirmed and made his heart audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>The spirit of God doth foretell things that are to come:</hi> And this is proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Propheſie: and this the Prophets did; <hi>Agabus</hi> and others in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Now the Divel alſo may uſe his inſtruments to foretel ſomething to come: not that of his own nature he can foretel things to come, for ſo it's Gods property; but by Revelation from God, God juſtly permitting this for to puniſh thoſe that ſhall be ſeduced: thus the Divel told <hi>Saul</hi> what ſhould befall him.

As the word of God is the Treaſure of all revealed truth, ſo God alſo implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Natural truth in our conſciences; ſo that the Spirit of God doth ſuggeſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is contrary either to <hi>revealed Truth, or implanted Truth,</hi> The Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt inſtanced in by <hi>Spanhemius</hi> in his Hiſtory, pretended he had a revelation to kill his brother, which accordingly he did: this revelation could not be of God, becauſe againſt natural light, but of the Divel.

                  </p>
                  <p>If you examine the courſe of the falſe Prophets in the Old Teſtament, and of thoſe recorded in the New, their fruit was corruption in manners, and worſhip, encouraging thoſe that were ungodly in their evil ways: It was <hi>Michaiah</hi> onely, not the other 400 Prophets that <hi>Ahab</hi> hated, becauſe he only faithfully reproved him for his ſin: ſo the Propheteſs ſuborned by <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> adverſaries, was to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him in the work of Reformation. Humility alſo will quickly manifeſt the ſpirit of God working in a man: <hi>Paul</hi> had a great rapture, even into the third heavens, <hi>but leaſt he ſhould be lifted up with the multitude of revelations, there was a thorn in the fleſh, and buffettings of Satan continually afflicting of him.</hi> The holy Ghoſt deſcended in the form of a Dove upon Chriſt, to ſhew how meek and humble the operations of it are in thoſe where it dwels.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Not onely ſuggeſtions from Satan may delude us, as if coming from the <note place="margin">8.

Hence the people of God, who are partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, are alſo poſſeſſed with an holy fear and trembling in themſelves, whereas others are not ſo.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Therefore are men confident in theſe, <hi>Becauſe they are admired by others,</hi>

                     <hi>and they draw a multitude of diſciples.</hi> Many times even godly men have been drawn aſide too much after thoſe, who have pretended to Revelations, and Extaſies. The Apoſtle ſpeaks 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 4. That he was among the Corinthians, not in enticing words of mans wiſdom, but in the demonſtration of the ſpirit.</hi> But how was that? becauſe his Doctrine was conſonant to Gods word, and it was companied with an efficacious power to raiſe up to all Godlines. Now falſe Apoſtles, that they may alſo be applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, would gladly come in ſome <hi>demonſtration of the ſpirit;</hi> nothing ſo prevailing as ſuch reſemblances: It is known in Eccleſiaſtical ſtory, how fouly <hi>Tertullian</hi> was deluded by admiring of <hi>Montanus</hi> and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> as Prophets, contemning all others as meer natural men: It is ſaid of <hi>Swinkfeldius,</hi> who ſo much magnified Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and debaſed Scripture, That <hi>Caput regulatum illi defuit, cor bonum non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuit,</hi> he had a good heart, though not a ſound head: ſo eaſily are good men tempted away, with that which ſeemeth to be more ſpiritual then ordinary.</p>

                     <hi>truth in the love of it.</hi> Thoſe four hundred falſe Prophets in <hi>Ahabs</hi> time, are thought by the learned to be true Prophets at firſt, and ſuch as were in the company and Colledge of the other Prophets; but abuſing that gift to the pleaſing of men, and ſeeking themſelves, they were juſtly by God delivered up to ſuch a falſe way. And that they were hardened in this deceitfull way, appeareth by <hi>Zedekiahs</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence, 1 <hi>King. 12. 24. When he ſtrook Michaiah upon the cheek, ſaying, which way went the spirit from me to thee?</hi> Thus if there be Revelations among the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, as they bragg of them, What is the fruit of them, but to confirm them more <hi>in believing of a lye?</hi> And where ſpiritual judgements are, they make ſecure, and full of ſelf-flattery.</p>
                  <p>Now the reaſons why we are not to rely on theſe, are <note place="margin">Reaſons for non-reliance upon theſe motions. 1. They are not marks of a Church.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe that cannot be the mark of a Godly man, which is not the note of a Church.</hi> Now although <hi>Bellarmine</hi> make <hi>Lumen Propheticum,</hi> Prophetical light a mark of the true Church, and would prove that we are not the true Church, becauſe we have no Prophets, or Revelations amongſt us, as they have: yet the Orthodox do reply, that even falſe Prophets may have prophetical illuſtrations, as is before quoted, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13. 1. and certainly <hi>Balaam</hi> was a wicked man, yet for all that, he had a ſpiritual Revelation from God. Yea, and <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> one of the worſt of men, yet it is ſaid he propheſied, becauſe he was <hi>high Prieſt that year:</hi> Therefore though thou hadſt predictions, divers Raptures, and extatical illuminations, yet theſe are no ſure mark of thy good condition: and ſeeing men unſanctified, may by the Holy Ghoſt work wonderfull things, is it ſuch a ſtrange thing if they may alſo have ſeveral raptures?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Neither may theſe be regarded, <hi>Becauſe ſuch pretended illuminati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi>

                     <hi>are conſiſtent with the works of ungodlineſs, and injuſtice, as appeareth</hi> Math. 7. <hi>Thoſe that propheſied in Chriſts name, were yet workers of iniquity. Spanh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This is to go far on in the way to the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt: and then on the other ſide take heed of a contrary error, that under the pretence of Revelations, thou deſpiſe the Scriptures, the Miniſtry, and the Ordinances. If Satan cannot ſeduce thee the former way, then he ſets upon thee in the latter way.

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THe Apoſtle his ſcope in the former part of this Chapter is to commend the graces of Gods Spirit above the gifts of the ſame. Hence he makes ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions of the moſt excellent perfections, which if without Charity, <hi>are but as a tinkling cymbal</hi> that may pleaſe the ear of others, but it ſelf is worn out and deſtroyed thereby. And by charity he means that unfeigned love of God, <note place="margin">Charity, what?</note> and the good of others, whereby all our gifts are improved for this end, and not for our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>His firſt inſtance is <hi>diverſity</hi> and <hi>variety of tongues,</hi> a gift in the Primitive times, that made the enjoyers thereof admirable.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond is of <hi>Prophecie</hi> and <hi>underſtanding of all Myſteries, all Knowledge, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">All faith.</note> 
                     <hi>all Faith.</hi> This place doth not prove juſtifying Faith to be ſeparable from Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. But either it is a conditional, hyperbolical ſpeech, like that <hi>Gal. 1. If an Angel from Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. as not onely ſome later Divines, but even the Ancients have thought: or elſe it may very well be reſtrained to miraculous Faith, in this ſenſe, If I had all miraculous faith, ſo that I were able to work the greateſt mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. And thus it is plain, ſuch a faith may be ſevered from true love.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle having thus inſtanced in Gifts, he further proceeds to give two glorious inſtances of the external works of grace, which are moſt admirable amongſt men, whereby he would teach us, That the moſt ſpecious and glorious external acts of grace, if ſeeming onely, are nothing, if grace it ſelf doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly animate them; ſo that inward grace in reſpect of thoſe external actions, is like the ſoul to the body, like art to the inſtruments of Muſick, without which an uncertain ſound is made.</p>
                  <p>Theſe glorious externals the Apoſtle ſpecifieth are of two ſorts:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A work of extraordinary mercy, <hi>If I beſtow all my goods to feed the poor.</hi> The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The ſecond inſtance is of remarkable fortitude and glorious courage for Chriſt and his truth, which is expreſſed in the deſignation of that action, wherein my courage may manifeſt it ſelf, <hi>If I give my body to be burnt.</hi> Where ſome obſerve this aggravation, Though a man be not ſummoned by others, and condemned to death, but although he willingly and ultroneouſly offer himſelf, and then not to be whipped or impriſoned, but to die, and that the moſt terrible kinde of death, even burning, yet if all this be without true love to God, his glory, Church and truth, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Chriſt indeed, or for that which a mans conſcience judgeth to be the truth of Chriſt, is a ſure and infallible ſign of the ſtate of grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Doctrine will be like a <hi>two edged ſword, dividing between the joint and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi> It's not all thy marks, ſtripes, impriſonments, perſecutions, though for a good cauſe, is enough to evidence thy true intereſt in Chriſt. To open this Point many things are conſiderable.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That many times perſecutions are a true diſcovery of a mans firmneſſe in grace.</hi> Inſomuch that all the while Chriſts cauſe and carnal accommodations are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned together, every hypocritical and unſound heart makes as great a ſhew, as that which is faithfull, <hi>But when ſtorms and tempests ariſe, then the houſe built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſand fals, but that on the rock endureth.</hi> Thus <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. when the <hi>hot Sun aroſe,</hi> perſecutions began to be violent, <hi>then that which was not deeply rooted, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently withered.</hi> So that howſoever we may not certainly gather the truth of our grace, by our perſeverance in perſecutions, yet troubles and oppoſitions do fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently diſcover who is falſe. Hence afflictions and not mercies are alwaies in Scripture called temptations, God is never ſaid to tempt by a mercy, but by an affliction, becauſe it is more difficult to withſtand an evil then to enjoy a good. The high and ſtrong windes diſcover how well-rooted the tree is; the fire will manifeſt the cracked veſſel. Oh then account it nothing to reſt upon, that thou art for the truth, thou owneſt God and good men! Alas as yet thou loſeſt no good, no profit by doing thus. If a man may be impriſoned, impoveriſhed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for the truths of God, and yet be nothing; then what a poor nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is Chriſts truth and thy riches with it! Alas Chriſt hath not put thee upon any trials, and thou knoweſt nothing by thy ſelf as yet. It's true, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſufferings, and that to death, are the higheſt expreſſions before men; and therefore we are to judge with charitable apprehenſions of all thoſe who are able thus to ſuffer for that which is the truth, eſpecially they at the ſame time demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating all Chriſtian deportment. Therefore it was cruelty in the Popiſh perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors to charge thoſe bleſſed Martyrs with ſtoutneſſe and pride. Hence alſo it is, that we account the Martyrdom of ſo many millions of all ſorts for Chriſt, to be an eminent teſtimony of the truth of Chriſtian Religion. No Sect could ever inſtance in the like, as Chriſtians may, which we read was acknowledged by <hi>Trajane</hi> the Emperour; and <hi>Juſtine Martyr</hi> confeſſeth the conſideration of the willingneſſe and zeal of Chriſtians to die for Chriſt, was the occaſion of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.

                  <p>Secondly, From hence it followeth, <hi>That whereſoever the Scripture promiſeth</hi>

                     <hi>ſalvation to any external action that is by way of Patience or Fortitude for Chriſt;</hi> That muſt be underſtood with this proviſo, that as the action for the matter is good, and the cauſe is good; ſo the motives that draw out his heart be alſo good. <hi>Matth. 10. 33. Whoſoever ſhall confeſſe me before men, him will my Father alſo acknowledge before his holy Angels.</hi> In this place a glorious reward is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to a ſtout confeſſion of Chriſt in the midſt of an adulterous generation, yet you muſt explain it thus, ſuppoſing he do as for Chriſt, ſo out of pure ends and holy affections, without which theſe external actions are but as ſo many glorious branches without any root at all; for we may ſee this fully confirmed in a paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel about giving of alms, and relieving the poor. There is ſcarce any religious duty hath more promiſes made to it in the Scripture then this hath, yet a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee who frequently gave aims, could take no comfort at all from thoſe Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, becauſe his motives were carnal and unworthy. Thus in ſufferings for Chriſt even in impriſonments and death it ſelf, it being poſſible that corrupt grounds
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:30767:81"/>
may ſway us, as well as heavenly, there can be no ſolid comfort from ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſufferings, though never ſo ſad and miſerable. Therefore no promiſe of heaven is made to the moſt ſpecious external exerciſe of any religious action whatſoever; Even now as on the contrary our Saviour ſaith, <hi>He that ſhall deny him before men, him will God alſo deny.</hi> This is to be underſtood univerſally, for <hi>Peter</hi> and many godly men have denied Chriſt, yet God did not deny them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their denial was through infirmity out of fear, not from any malicious or purpoſed obſtinacy againſt him. So then in all externall duties we are not onely to look to the matter that it be good, but alſo to what frame of heart, we doe thoſe things with; and in this lieth the marrow of Chriſtianity, to look to internals, as well as externals; the former onely commends us to God, though the later make us admirable among men.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is very poſſible for a man to ſuffer much loſſe, and endure hardſhip for</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. There may be patient ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſoundneſſe of heart.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt, and yet have not his heart ſound towards God.</hi> In the Apoſtles times, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles were ſo great, and carnal diſcouragements ſo many, that we may wonder any hypocrites or unſound men ſhould joyn to that way which was ſo oppoſed and perſecuted, yet there were <hi>falſe Apoſtles and falſe Brethren; There were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that ſought their own, and not the things of Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> complaineth, <hi>Phil,</hi> 1. 22. and this was ſtrange, for if they did ſeek their own, why did they not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Chriſt? why did they not abjure the Goſpel, ſeeing that was the cauſe of all the violence brought upon them? All that profeſſed Chriſt in thoſe daies were like <hi>Sheep among Wolves, Doves among Hawks;</hi> yet even among thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging Chriſt in the midſt of an adulterous generation, all were not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. <hi>Judas</hi> left all as well as the other Apoſtles, and this was a kinde of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this was a <hi>taking up of the Croſſe and following him;</hi> We ſee when Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſuch things of others, though they ſeemed to profer themſelves, yet they preſently revolted. Therefore <hi>Judas</hi> went further. And the Apoſtle <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 4. ſuppoſeth men may ſuffer great and grievous troubles for Chriſt, yet all in vain, <hi>Have ye ſuffered</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> an aggravating word, <hi>ſo many things</hi> for number, ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous for quality, and <hi>all this in vain?</hi> implying, that if they revolted to thoſe <hi>Moſaical</hi> Ceremonies from Chriſt, all their former ſufferings for the truth, would be wholly unprofitable, indeed he addeth a rhetorical correction <hi>[If ſo be in vain]</hi> as hoping better things of them. Take we heed then, that we do not only loſe all our praiers, Sacraments, and ſuch like Duties, but alſo our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and troubles for a good cauſe. For ſufferings for God are more then doings for God. Hence the Apoſtle ſpeaketh by way of aggravation, <hi>We account theſe light afflictions, not comparable to that eternal weight of glory,</hi> and for an inſtance of loſing our ſufferings for God, we have a remarkable inſtance <hi>Act.</hi> 19. 33. of <hi>Alexander</hi> venturing his life in the multitude enraged at <hi>Paul</hi> and others for the cauſe of Chriſt, yet by moſt learned Interpreters, this is that <hi>Alexander Paul</hi> doth ſo complain of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 20. that did him ſo much wrong. And it is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly known, that many who in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> daies continued faithful to Chriſt, in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> daies through peace and quietneſs grew corrupt.</p>
                  <p>Now that it may more plainly appear, our ſufferings though for a good cauſe <note place="margin">What ſinful in gredients make ſufferings un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable? I. When men ſuffer for truth as their intereſt</note> may be corrupted, we may <hi>take notice of what ſinfull ingredients there may be which will make theſe ſufferings unprofitable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>A man may ſuffer for the truth, or a good cauſe, not as it is true or good, but as his interest is in it, and as it is that way he hath ingaged himſelf in.</hi> Thus a man may die for Proteſtaniſm againſt Popery, not ſo much becauſe it's the truth of God, but becauſe it is that truth he hath lived in, it is that wherein all his outward intereſt lieth. O beloved! This curſed corruption is too common and frequent, not to look upon the truth of Chriſt, the cauſe of Chriſt, as his, but as it is ours, and ſo we become ſufferers or Martyrs for our ſelves, and not for Chriſt. Among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſome ſaid they were for <hi>Paul,</hi> others for <hi>Apollo,</hi> others for <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:30767:82"/>
It is judged by ſome Interpreters, thoſe were indeed for Chriſt, but they ſet him up by way of a party and faction, as their Chriſt, rather then Chriſt. Although therefore impriſonments, perſecutions, are terrible and dreadfull to fleſh and bloud, and they may be thought great teſtimonies of love to God and his cauſe? Yet be not too confident here, make diligent ſearch of thy heart, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that which moveth thee in all theſe ſufferings, be not thy intereſt, thou art ingaged in this way; And ſo an argument from thy propriety, not Chriſts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, prevail over thee. We may obſerve of Chriſts kindred, how deſirous they were that Chriſt ſhould do miracles; now their motive was not ſpiritual, that hereby he might be demonſtrated the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> and ſo men graciouſly receive him, but from carnal pride, becauſe he was their kinſman, and this might exalt their glory among others, ſuch carnal ſelf-ſeeking affections men may have to the truths of Chriſt, deſiring they may be exalted, becauſe hereby themſelves ſhall be exalted.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The power of truth may undeniably ſo work on the conſcience, that they</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">II. Suffering only upon truths convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, not ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations.</note> 
                     <hi>cannot deny it, yet for all this not powerfully ſanctifie their hearts.</hi> Thus a man may be ſo convinced of the true Doctrine, and his conſcience ſet ſuch a ſtrong ſeal to it, that if he had all the world, he dared not gainſay it. <hi>Balaam, though he had a houſe full of gold, yet would not curſe thoſe whom he ſaw God would bleſſe.</hi> There is a natural light and goad by the conſcience, whereby it makes a man willing to undergo any puniſhment rather then contradict it. Thus <hi>Socrates</hi> he died for this truth, that there was but one God, and when he was condemned by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, ſtaid himſelf with that which we read of the Apoſtles, <hi>It is better to obey God then man.</hi> This makes it evident, that a man having no more then nature in him, may yet die for thoſe truths he is convinced of. Thus there are many who it may be reform not their lives from groſſe impieties, yet would die rather then turn <hi>Papiſts</hi> or <hi>Socinians,</hi> I mean learned men, who have their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings fully ſatisfied with the truth. And Hiſtory affords us many examples of Heathens, who would rather endure the moſt terrible death, then do any thing againſt moral honeſty, why may not there be ſuch orthodox Proteſtants, ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring as much for thoſe truths, which they are perſwaded are of God? There is a know approved ſentence, <hi>Cauſa non poena facit Martyrem,</hi> the cauſe not the puniſhment makes a Martyr, but this is not enough, for neither puniſhment nor cauſe make a Martyr, without a gracious frame of heart, at leaſt to God, though with man he may be judged ſo. So <hi>that theſe three muſt go to make a Martyr, pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, a good cauſe, and a good heart.</hi> Therefore in all thy ſufferings, ſay, It is not enough that I ſuffer for God and his truth, but doeſt thou alſo ſuffer with ſuch a gracious, humble and heavenly heart, as Gods cauſe doth require? Look that beſides conviction of judgement, there be alſo renovation of affections.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>A man may ſuffer, though for Gods truth, yet the motive be the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">III. Suffering for truth but from a ſtout ſtomack.</note> 
                     <hi>meer ſtoutneſſe of his ſtomack, and undaunted reſolutions of ſpirit.</hi> As there is a ſpiritual fortitude wrought in us by Gods Spirit, ſo there is alſo in ſome men a natural height of ſpirit, whereby they fear not dangers or death. Now it is much to be enquired into, Whether thy ſufferings ariſe from the ſtrength of Gods Spirit, or the ſtrength of thy own? Even <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> with his purblinde light of nature could make a difference between fortitude a vertue, when a man would die for vertues ſake, and upon vertuous grounds; and an audacious man, who would contemn death out of a raſh boldneſſe in him. Oh then! How <hi>ſtraight is the way to Heaven?</hi> How rare is grace, when our very ſufferings in a good cauſe, may be ſo much corrupted and polluted through ſinfull ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients? when men ſhall ſay not only, <hi>Lord, we have prayed in thy Name, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied in thy Name;</hi> but Lord we have ſuffered in thy Name, been impriſoned in thy Name, died in thy Name, and yet God return this anſwer, <hi>Depart from me, I know ye not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:30767:82"/>
Fourthly, A fourth corrupt motive in ſufferings though for God, <hi>may be</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">IIII. Suffering to get a name.</note> 
                     <hi>Pride and Vain-glory, Ambition to get a Name in the Generations to come.</hi> One would think this were a poor thing to venture a mans life for ſuch an aëry bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Yet if we reade humane Hiſtories, and ſee how willingly men have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed themſelves to death for this outward glory; or if we peruſe Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtories, and conſider, how much the Patriarchall Hereticks, Heads of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, have ſuffered to propagate their Sects, we will ceaſe to wonder; for as by the bloud of Martyrs, the Church hath flouriſhed, ſo ſometimes by the bloud of Hereticks, Hereſies have encreaſed; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Many of the godly waxed bolder by his bonds;</hi> So many times doe erroneous perſons grow more obſtinate by the ſufferings of their fellow Hereticks. Though aſhes and fire are barren things, yet pride is ſuch a <hi>Salamander,</hi> that will live in theſe flames.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, In the fourth general place, <hi>As ſufferings for Chriſt, doe not</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. To ſuffer for ſuppoſed truths but real errors, cannot poſſibly argue grace.</note> 
                     <hi>argue neceſſarily a ſtate of Grace, ſo much leſſe doe ſufferings for thoſe things a miſguided conſcience thinketh the truths of God, but are indeed damnable He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refies, and dangerous Opinions.</hi> Yet how often doe we finde this in Books to prove Hereſies great innocency, becauſe they goe with a good conſcience, they deny all carnal emoluments, patiently ſuffer the utmoſt dangers! but (alas) here is no ſolidity in this: For firſt, A falſe miſled conſcience may put a man upon all outward dangers. A deluded conſcience in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, will throw a man, as that Devil did the party poſſeſſed, <hi>Sometimes in the fire, and ſometimes in the water:</hi> So that as our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Some men thought they did God good ſervice in putting others to death:</hi> So again, They may think they doe God great ſervice in ſuffering themſelves to be put to death. Doe not Socinians die? Doe not Papiſts die for their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? A falſe Religion, eſpecially if received upon conſcientious, not politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Principles, will make a man think his bloud not dear enough to loſe for that. The Phariſees by <hi>what reaſon they compaſſed Sea and Land to make proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes,</hi> by the ſame they would have loſt their lives to defend their ſuperſtitious worſhip. Doe not then hereafter admire that ſpecious Argument for Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks? Doe they ſeek themſelves? Doe they not deny all worldly hopes? Doe they not give their bodies to be deſtroyed? for this is no more then Heathens do for their Idols. Nor is it any wonder, if men die thus for a falſe Religion, ſeeing we reade of Atheiſts who have died becauſe they held there was no God. <hi>Vaninus</hi> who once wrote a Book to prove God and his Providence, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards revolted to Atheiſme, holding no God, and was put to death for it at <hi>Paris:</hi> And being commanded by the Judge, that he ſhould ask forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, and the King, and his Judges: He anſwered, Of God he would not, becauſe he did not believe there was any: Of the King he would not becauſe he had not wronged him; Of his Judges he would not, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther if there were a Hell, as he believed there was none, he would curſe them all thither. Thus <hi>Voetius de Atheiſmo.</hi> You ſee here a miſerable wretch, dying for this profeſſedly, becauſe he thought there was no God. So that all ſufferings even to death, are not preſently to move us.</p>
                  <p>And if you ask, <hi>What ſhould make them thus venturous, if they be not in Gods way?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, two things, Firſt, <hi>There is a Carnal Self.</hi> Secondly, <hi>A Spiritual</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">What makes men ſo ready to ſuffer, if out of Gods way. 1. Self.</note> 
                     <hi>Self;</hi> which alſo is carnal, though not groſſe. <hi>A carnal Self is then ſet up, when a man proſtitutes all Religion to outward advantages:</hi> Of ſuch were ſome falſe Apoſtles <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Whoſe God was their belly, who minded earthly things,</hi> and did all they could to avoid perſecution. Such an one was one <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus</hi> a Biſhop in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, nicknamed <hi>Euripus,</hi> becauſe of his fickleneſſe in Religion, turning his conſcience, as <hi>Diogenes</hi> did his Barrell al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes againſt the winde. This man, when the warre was between <hi>Conſtantine</hi>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:30767:83"/>
the Chriſtian, and <hi>Lycinius</hi> the Heatheniſh Perſecutour, appointed his Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con to reſide at <hi>Constantinople,</hi> with this Direction, That he which did prevail in the battel, either <hi>Conſtantine</hi> or <hi>Lycinius,</hi> he ſhould gratifie his victory with ſome Preſents to him. This kinde of carnal Self is odious in the eyes of all men.</p>
                  <p>But then ſecondly, <hi>There is a Spiritual-carnal Self. When a man ſeeks not outward greatneſſe and pomp in the world, but is inwardly proud, ambitious, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting a Name by ſome ſingular thing;</hi> And becauſe this cannot be had in the world, without outward paſſages of worldly ſelf-denial, therefore he is dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to deny himſelf carnally, that he may ſeek himſelf ſpiritually: and this hath been the temper of many Hereticks, prizing their Opinion and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall Abilities above all externall glory. Now this ſpirituall carnall ſelf, is that which may put them upon impriſonments, and all outward ruine; So that herein they be the fleſhes Martyrs, Pride-martyrs, not Gods. Hence although they may ſuffer like true Martyrs, yet for the moſt part they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a carnall temper then, not ſhewing that holineſſe, humility, ſelf-reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation into Gods hands, as the godly Martyrs doe. So that their very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſufferings have not ſuch ſweet Concomitants, as the godly men have. <hi>The godly men burning in the fire, being like Juniper in the fire, ſending a ſweet ſmell. The Heretick like crackling Thorns in the fire, full of diſcontent, rage and revenge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>The Devil who was a Man-ſlayer from the beginning, he through ſtrong</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Satan.</note> 
                     <hi>deluſions tempts men to ſuch hardineſſe, as to be prodigal of their lives.</hi> That as when he poſſeſſed the bodies of ſome, he delighted to torment them, and to make them miſerable; ſo he doth alſo when he hath bewitched their ſouls. It is matter of amazement to me, when I reade the Story of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natiſts,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Circumcelliones,</hi> how greedy they were to die, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to kill men, if they would not kill them. Whence ſhould this madneſſe ariſe, and fury to die, but from the Devil? yet they thought this great piety, and contempt of the world. Therefore the Devil by Gods juſt permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, may benumme and harden a man to die, as well as the Spirit of God in a gracious manner imbolden a man: And this may ſuffice to open the Point.</p>
                  <p>Now two grounds among others there are, <hi>Why we may not judge the firmneſſe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Why we may not judge of our ſpiritual eſtates by theſe ſufferings. 1. Becauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward life onely maketh all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternals good.</note> 
                     <hi>of our ſpiritual eſtate by theſe ſufferings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe no externals, whether in actions or paſſions, are any further good, then as they are animated from a ſpiritual life within.</hi> Theſe outwards may be informed from a corrupt principle, as well as a ſpiritual one. We cannot judge of the Tree by this fruit, becauſe it will grow both upon good and bad. Now herein we daily delude our ſelves, becauſe we judge our eſtate good, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Actions, when yet reprobates may doe the like. It is not here as it was with <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres, Moſes</hi> doth many miracles, and they do the like, but at laſt <hi>Moſes</hi> doth ſuch things which they could not imitate. If you ſpeak of externals meerly as abſtracted from inwards, we cannot judge. Do the godly pray, hear? ſo doe the reprobates: May the godly ſuffer, be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, die for the truth? ſo may reprobates. It is true our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Greater love then this can no man ſhew, then to lay down ones life for another.</hi> So one would think, <hi>to give ones body to be burnt, and yet have no Charity,</hi> were to ſpeak a contradiction. But when we conſider how ſtrong and potent corruption and a falſe Religion is, then we may no more admire. We reade in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament of ſome ſuperſtitious parents, that would <hi>make their children paſſe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the fire to Moloch,</hi> that is, they offered them as a Sacrifice in the fire to <hi>Moloch:</hi> who would not wonder, how the tender bowels of a father or mother could ever become thus ſenſleſſe like a ſtone? But ſuperſtition made them thus
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:30767:83"/>
unnatural. And certainly as they offered their tender children, ſo if <hi>Moloch</hi> their god had required it, or rather his Prieſts for him, They would have given up their own bodies into the flames. Judge not then of the goodneſſe of thy eſtate, by any externals whatſoever, though never ſo ſpecious. They are a ſheath that will receive either a golden, or an iron Sword in them.

                  <p>THis Text is a remarkable Hiſtory, wherein many excellent practicall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines are contained. The whole ſcope being to repreſent a man that hath good affections and deſires for heaven, yet becauſe of ſome ſtrong corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and temptation violently detained from it; for in the cloſe of the Hiſtory he goeth away, not reviling and raging at Chriſt, as the Phariſees uſed to do, but <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>exceeding ſorrowfull,</hi> and as <hi>Mark</hi> hath it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as ſadly affected, as the sky ſeemeth to be, when it's black with clouds, and threatens rain; ſo that in this poſture with Chriſt he is like the Poets <hi>Medea,</hi> or like <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> incontinent perſon, who hath great conviction, but ſtrong corruption.</p>
                  <p>In the Hiſtory obſerve <hi>the Perſon and his Queſtion propounded: The perſon,</hi> as appeareth by the Harmony of three Evangeliſts was <hi>a rich man,</hi> a great man in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and place, and a young man: All which three were ſore temptations to prejudice him againſt Chriſt and his way: Yet by <hi>his Queſtion</hi> it ſeemed he was not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prophane and worldly, for his deſire is to know <hi>What he might do to have eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</hi> In which Queſtion although we may perceive a Phariſaicall leaven in him, thinking by works to be ſaved, yet there appeareth for the main a good deſire in him. Our Saviour intending to beat down his Phariſaicall confidence, which is as great an enemy to Chriſt as Publican ſinnes, firſt reproveth him for his compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and then anſwereth his Queſtion. His reproof is, <hi>Why callest thou me good, there is none good but God?</hi> Chriſt refuſed this title, partly becauſe he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him good in no other ſenſe, then as ſome eminent and ſingular Prophet, not as indeed the Son of God: but eſpecially to teach the young man that he was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly corrupted, and therefore whatſoever good is in us, is to be acknowledged, as coming from God; it is his gift, it is none of our work.</p>
                  <p>In the next place our Saviour directs him to <hi>keep the Commandements,</hi> inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing not in the Ceremoniall, but the morall, nor in the morall duties that relate to God, but that belong to our neighbour, which were moſt vulgar, that hereby he might teach this Phariſaicall man, that he never yet performed any one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment aright. Therefore the ignorance and the arrogance of this young man in the text is remarkable; <hi>All theſe have I kept from my youth up;</hi> he thought he had kept not ſome but all, and that from his youth up, as ſoon as ever he could act with reaſon; ſome Expoſitors think, that he groſly lyed againſt his own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in ſaying ſo: but that is not likely becauſe <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith <hi>Christ loved him,</hi> upon this ſpeech, and that could not be if he were ſuch a diſſembler; and if you take
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:30767:84"/>
the word <hi>love,</hi> for to praiſe or kindely to ſpeak to a man; as the Septuagint ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times do, <hi>Caut. 1. 1, 4. 2 Chron.</hi> 18. it will argue that he was no hypocrite, and hereby we ſee, that it is a Miniſters duty to love and encourage thoſe men, who though they have not the truth of grace, yet have a fair, civill, honeſt life, and have generall deſires for heaven. He did not therefore lie againſt his conſcience, but yet he ſpake that which was falſe, for he had not kept one of thoſe Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments perfectly, as appeareth by that tryall or exploratory precept Chriſt puts him upon: only he knew no better: He was brought up in ignorance about the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall latitude and extent of the Law, and ſo thought a meer negative, or not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing groſſe wickedneſſe, to be a poſitive keeping of the Law.</p>
                  <p>Obſ. <hi>It is a very difficult thing to drive an unregenerate man out of this falſe ſign</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obſ.</hi> Many men though falſly; yet confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly think they keep Gods Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> 
                     <hi>of his good eſtate,</hi> viz. <hi>that he keeps the Commandements of God.</hi> This was the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. In this was the fundamentall miſcarriage of this great man, that he had a confident perſwaſion of his good eſtate, becauſe <hi>he did no murder, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted no Adultery, he bore no falſe witneſſe against his neighbour,</hi> Now falſly jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging this to be all the Law required, he concludeth that unleſſe Chriſt hath ſome new and extraordinary way about this, theſe matters are ſo low and eaſie, that he obſerved them along while ago. Upon this point was our Saviours greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with the Phariſees, who like Serpents, though they had a fine skin and colour, yet inwardly were full of poyſon: and the great work that the Miniſters of God have to do in their Congregations in theſe times, Is it not to ſhew to men the pure glaſſe of the Law, that they looking therein, may ſee their defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and be wonderfully out of love with themſelves? Doth not every man walk with this ſelf-damning principle, that his heart is good? What would you have him to do more then he doth? Is he any Drunkard, Whoremonger? and thus he pleaſeth himſelf with an externall righteouſneſſe, being altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the pure and excellent work of regeneration, and from hence it is, that our auditors are filled with ſo much ſtupidity and ſecurity, that it is a wonder to hear of a man or woman, with fear and trembling, expoſtulating after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: The Law is ſo ſpirituall, and I am ſo carnall; regeneration and a new nature is ſo neceſſary, but I am ſo plunged in that ſinfull eſtate and corruption I was born in, That I fear my ſelf, I quake at my condition, Oh for the Lords ſake, help ye Miniſters by your praiers and directions, that I may be put in a ſafe way.</p>
                  <p>For the clearing of the Doctrine conſider, <note place="margin">Whence mens ſtrong perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of their exact lives ariſe.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Whence it ariſeth that men have ſuch a ſtrong perſwaſion of their good lives, as ſatisfactory to Gods Law.</hi> Why is it that though a man by nature be indeed like a <hi>Job,</hi> or <hi>Lazarus full of wounds and ſores:</hi> yee he judgeth himſelf like <hi>Abſolom, altogether fair, without any blemiſh at all?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And the firſt ground is <hi>ignorance about the totall deep, and univerſal pollution of our</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. From igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 
                     <hi>natures,</hi> whereby this Leproſie hath made all we are and all we do unclean: and in this ſenſe our Saviour faith, <hi>we may call none good,</hi> for can we call any ſpiders, any ſerpents, any toads ſweet? ſo neither can we call any man good or holy. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Scripture that it may lay a foundation for our prizing of Chriſt, and open our eyes to ſee the neceſſity of regeneration, is very diligent and copious in aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating this naturall defilement. <hi>Paul</hi> is a cleer inſtance in this, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. his heart was like a dungeon full of noiſome and crawling vermine, but becauſe no light was in his heart, therefore he did not ſee, or beleeve this. Let me therefore expoſtulate with thee, who pleaſeſt thy ſelf in thy good eſtate: Is thy life as free from ſin as the childe new born? may no more iniquity be laid to thy charge now, then could be to thee, when thou ſuckedſt at thy mothers breaſt? yet, if no more, thou ought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not to take any content or delight in thy ſelf, but to tremble and earneſtly to importune to be <hi>tranſlated from that darkneſſe into light:</hi> lay aſide then thy high, and ſelf-flattering thoughts; ſay no more, thy good heart, thy good meaning, thy good life, but cry out <hi>unclean and unclean.</hi> Wo, wo unto me, <hi>for I am polluted in
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:30767:85"/>
my blood, and God might not ſay unto me in my bloud, live,</hi> as he did to the Church, but to die, and be damned: Wouldeſt thou therefore no longer be ſick of this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ſurfet and fullneſſe? ſtudy more, and meditate more of originall corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how univerſall and diffuſive it is, how contagious and infecting of every thing that we do, ſo that <hi>although we could ſpeak with the tongue of Angels,</hi> and work with the hands of Angels, yet we being in our naturall condition, all that would be abominable: <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God, and the tree muſt be good before the fruit; To the defiled, all things are defiled.</hi> What therefore is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall righteouſneſſe, morall juſtice, formall piety, as long as we abide in that old bitter ſtock of nature? Pray therefore, Lord give me to underſtand what I am by nature, make me to know how ſinfull and lothſome it is, and let not this be a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, ſpeculative, barren knowledge, but let it be a cloſe, particular applicative, and practicall knowledge, whereby the whole heart may be ſet on fire, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully wrought upon, even to bid all creatures, all comforts, all buſineſſes ſtand aloof till thou be redeemed from this thraldome.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another cauſe of this bold perſwaſion is, <hi>An ignorance of the ſpirituall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſſe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Ignorance of the Laws ſpirituall exactneſſe.</note> 
                     <hi>and obligation of the Law.</hi> It was the received opinion of the Jews, and the Phariſees they ſo explained it, as appeareth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. that the Law command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only externall acts, and that we ſatisfied it, if we did keep it in the outward man. Therefore our Saviour ſeemed to bring new doctrine into the world, when he explained the Law of heart-ſins, and ſhewed that men might be adulterers, murderers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> though they never committed thoſe externall acts. This was ſo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxall to the received doctrine at that time, that men were amazed at it. Now howſoever (it may be) people will acknowledge the doctrine true, yet in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice they are as greſſe and ſecure as ever Jews and Phariſees were. Neither did they ever make their works a refuge, and a bulwark, more then people now adaies do. And no wonder, for <hi>Paul</hi> ſo great a proficient in the knowledge of the Law of God, yet confeſſeth his great blindeneſſe and miſtake herein, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. inſomuch that when he cometh to underſtand how ſpirituall the law is, and how carnall he is, he cryeth out of himſelf as moſt miſerable. <hi>The Law is spirituall,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> that is, it reacheth to the ſinnes of the ſpirit, it forbiddeth all inordinate motions there, it prohioits all their ſecret irregularities: ſo that as <hi>God is the father of spirits,</hi> thus the Law is the Law of ſpirits, and thou maieſt become an ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

No man can bewail the obliquity and crooked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his actions, that doth not diligently apply them to the ſtraightneſſe of the rule, Oh then ſay, This juſtice, this honeſty, this freedome from groſſe ſinne is highly eſteemed among men: but what is it to Gods Law? how foul a tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor ſhall I be convinced to be, if I compare my ſelf with that rule! Hence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ariſeth all that ſelf-righteouſneſſe, in that men do no more underſtand how holy and exact that rule is by which they ought to walk. There is a world of unſeen, and unknown filthineſſe in thee, and if thy eyes were opened to behold it thou couldſt no longer abide thy ſelf. But it is no wonder, that unregenerate men who have no life at all in them, feel none of theſe diſtempers, when the godly themſelves as appeareth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. cry cut, <hi>Who can underſtand his errours, cleanſe me from ſecret ſins:</hi> By that <hi>David</hi> implyeth, that there is more corruption in his heart then he is aware of. Much unknown pride, hypocriſie, earthlineſs dwels in their hearts, and they perceive it not. If therefore it be thus with the godly, that they are not able to underſtand how lothſome and wretched they are, is it any wonder if men dead wholly in ſinne, feel not any burthen, though mountains lie upon them? Soon therefore wouldeſt thou depoſe thoſe lofty imaginations, if ſo be thou wouldeſt on purpoſe conſider how exact the Law is, forbidding the root, as well as the branches of ſinne, making every inordinate motion, (thouſands of

                     <hi>negative Commandements, Thou ſhalt do no murder;</hi> Thou ſhalt not ſteal; Thou ſhalt not forſwear thy ſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo ſuppoſe that the whole duty required by God of us, is ſwallowed up in thoſe negatives. This made the young man no doubt ſo bold; <hi>from his youth up,</hi> he had been preſerved from ſuch foul, groſſe ſins. Indeed he ſpeaks arrogantly when he ſaith, <hi>I have kept theſe;</hi> as if he by his own power had reſtrained that ſea of corruption from overflowing the banks; for what evill hath been committed by <hi>any</hi> man, which <hi>he</hi> might not alſo have done, had not God bounded and limited his wickedneſſe? Well but howſoever though he be thus ſpotleſſe in his life: yet that is not all God requireth, God hath poſitive commands, as well as negatives; and the ſame authority which ſaith, <hi>Do not steal, do not kill,</hi> ſaith alſo, <hi>Keep the Sabbath holy,</hi> and <hi>ſanctifie the Name of God.</hi> Now although this be a very ſmall matter to build a mans ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon, yet we may wonder to ſee that all the covering many men have for their nakedneſſe, is only theſe fig-leaves: That they are no drunkards, no whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, no thieves; A meer negative godlineſſe, what pity is it, that a people inſtructed out of Gods Word, living under the means of ſalvation, ſhould appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend no better in matters of God?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another cauſe of falſe perſwaſion is, that <hi>although they may minde affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. From not underſtanding the compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive ſenſe of affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</note> 
                     <hi>precepts, as well as negatives, yet they underſtand them not in their comprehenſive ſenſe,</hi> and ſo think they have attained to what the Law requireth, when indeed they fall exceeding ſhort. As for example, this command <hi>Thou ſhalt do no murder,</hi> doth not only forbid that ſin, but command the contrary duty, and not only ſo, but all the means, occaſions, and circumſtances that tend thereunto; and ſo in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry commandment. Now if a man conſider ſeriouſly how many occaſions and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and cauſes there are of all ſinnes; as on the contrary, how many oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, motives and cauſes there are of holy duties, he will ſtand amazed to ſee himſelf ſo much guilty in millions of ſinnes, which he thought could never have been laid to his charge; ſo then as the Goſpel hath a myſtery of grace, and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſin a myſtery of ſin, ſo that we are never able to go to the depth and breadth of theſe: So the Law is a myſtery of duties: and as the Logicians ſay, The ten predicaments do contain every created being that is in the world; ſo do theſe ten Commandements all the duties required of us; It is therefore of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence if ever men would be driven out of theſe golden dreams, and fooliſh Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſes they fancy to themſelves, to ſtudy, and underſtand the comprehenſive ſenſe of every precept.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Another ſtupifying and benumming principle, is the totall neglect <hi>of that</hi>

Hence are thoſe duties ſo frequently preſſed, <hi>to commune with our own hearts,</hi> to ſweep them, as ſome tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate, to dig into them, as others; and this duty is to be done with much ſtillneſſe and quietneſſe of ſpirit, and at thoſe times when we are moſt free from diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances, according to that rule, <hi>anima ſedendo, &amp; quieſcendo fit ſapiens.</hi> In other Texts, it is called <hi>ſearching our hearts, and trying our reins;</hi> which duties imply, that our hearts are not preſently what they outwardly appear: Gold may be in the ſurface, and iron or ſtone in the bottom; you know how impoſſible <hi>Hazael</hi> thought that ſhould be in his heart, and done by him, which the Prophet foretold. Man in that he is rationall, can only reflect upon himſelf, beaſts cannot, and it is a great obſtruction to ſalvation, that men uſe this no more, no man ſaith accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Prophet, <hi>What have I done?</hi> Therefore deal with your ſelves as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my would do. The Hebrew word for an enemy is an Obſerver, becauſe he watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and lyeth at the carch to ſee what haltings and failings there be; Do thou thus become an enemy to thy ſelf, and that is to be a friend to thy ſelf; Say, O Lord I arraign my ſelf at thy barre, I would be winnowed that my chaff may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,

I would be filed, that my ruſt come off. It is ſtrange to conſider what ſinnes men may live in, and yet not attend to the conſideration of ſuch. The making of a practicall Syllogiſm would be very introductory to our full converſion unto God, in this manner: The Scripture in ſeverall places ſpeaketh terrible threatnings to ſuch and ſuch ſins. But I live in ſuch and ſuch ſins. Therefore all thoſe threatnings belong to me: oh how can the ſoul put off this conviction? how can it extinguiſh this light ſhining upon it? what have I to do but to repent and turn to God!

But the unregenerate man he is in the other extremity, he preſumeth of good to be in him, when it is not; a full inſtance of this is, the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>ſhe was full, and wanted nothing,</hi> as if ſhe were God himſelf, for he only is allſufficient, yet ſhe boaſteth, ſhe wanteth nothing, not a God, or Chriſt, or his grace, when at the ſame time, <hi>ſhe was miſerable, and wanted all things.</hi> Here was a great difference between Gods judgement about them, and their own; and it is a poor ſmall thing to be acquitted by our ſelves, when God doth condemn us: Therefore ſay, It is thy folly, it is thy madneſſe, it is thy ſelf-love, makes thee conclude thy ſelf in a good eſtate: Doth God ſay ſo? Do the Scriptures ſay ſo? It is a ſinne to call good evill, and evill good, in our ſelves as well as in others.</p>

                  <p>From the Text we may obſerve,</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>The <hi>Phariſee</hi> for this unuſual, and ſupererogating way of exactneſs, as they judged, was reputed by himſelf and others, as thoſe that ſhould certainly go to Heaven, if any did. How confidently they uſed to preſume of this, appeareth by <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 3. 5, 6, 7. Where making a Catalogue of thoſe things, <hi>He once thought a gain to him;</hi> he inſtanceth in this as one of the laſt and moſt noble priviledges, that <hi>he was after the Law, a Phariſee:</hi> Inſomuch that if any might have confidence in external priviledges, he ſaith, <hi>he might.</hi> Where <hi>Paul</hi> alſo at another time, <hi>Acts</hi> 22. 3. Declaring his former converſation, mentioneth this particular, as the main, ſaying, <hi>He was taught according to the perfect manner of the Law of the Fathers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To diſcover this falſe ſign, ſeveral things are conſiderable, as</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The way to heaven is a ſtrict and exact way, and all our duties are to be done</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. The way to heaven is ſtrict</note> 
                     <hi>with a curious circumſpection:</hi> Our prayers are to be exact prayers; our obedience exact obedience: ſo <hi>Epheſ. 3. Walk</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>exactly:</hi> Hence the <hi>Gate that leads to happineſs is ſtraight and narrow, as the way to hell is broad and eaſie.</hi> I ſhall not therefore ſpeak againſt a true and Scripture-exactneſs: the people of God may, and ought to take comfort, in that they walk in a more ſingular and exact way then the world doth, and a man living and dying in the common rode and practices of men, having nothing more extraordinary in him then they; hath no ſymptome of grace upon him: <hi>Math.</hi> 5. Our ſaviour ſpeaking to his Diſciples, <hi>That they ſhould love their enemies;</hi> For ſaith he, <hi>If ye love your friends, what ſingular thing do ye? do not the Publicans the ſame?</hi> Therefore from hence it followeth, That the people of God ought to do ſingular things to men of the world: There is a good ſingularity and preciſeneſs: and howſoever the prophane world make a taunt, and reproach of this, that you are ſo ſingular and preciſe, yet none are Godly that are not ſo: <hi>Do not even the Publicans the ſame?</hi> He that goeth no further, and doth no more then Publicans, hath no evidence for ſalvation: Therefore lay down this for a foundation, <hi>The way of Godlineſs, is a ſtrict, preciſe, ſingular way.</hi> The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture makes it an exact courſe; and therefore my diſſolute, careleſs, negligent walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, can no more claim a Title to heaven, then darkneſs to light. Attend to this, you whoſe lives are as moſt of the world are; proud as they, prophane as they, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning of Religion as they.</p>
                  <p>Now, <hi>That godlineſs muſt be ſtrictneſs appeareth partly from the nature of Grace,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">I. From the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety of grace to our affections.</note> 
                     <hi>which is contrary to our affections,</hi> and ſo doth with prevailing power ſubdue them to the grief of the unregenerate part: Hence the Scripture calls it, <hi>Mortifying, and crucifying the old man;</hi> which implyeth the pain and Agony our corrupt part is exerciſed with by Grace: <hi>Chriſtianus eſt perpetua naturae violentia,</hi> to conquer luſts, is <hi>To pull out the right eye, and chop off the right hand:</hi> and by this we may ſee how few are Godly, becauſe they are rare that feel this ſpiritual conflict and agony, there is no mortifying and crucifying within them.</p>
                  <p>Again, Godlineſs muſt needs be exactneſs: partly, <hi>Becauſe our duties are ſo bounded, and circumſtantiated in their principles, manner and ends,</hi> That to do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:30767:88"/>
good action, is alwaies to hit the mark, as to ſin, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is to miſs the ſcope and white. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> placed his Moral virtue, <hi>in medio,</hi> and ſo made it difficult to avoid extremities on both ſides: but (alas!) the word of God requireth far more concurrences then ever the light of nature could diſcern: ſo that if you take any religious action, whether <hi>elicite,</hi> or <hi>imperate,</hi> to do it after a godly maner, there muſt be a great deal of circumſpection: there is ſo much required in the cauſe, in the manner, in the motive, that we may cry out for every particular duty, which <hi>Paul</hi> did for one main one, <hi>Who is ſufficient for theſe things?</hi> ſo that negligence, formality, and luke-warmneſs can no more conſiſt with godlineſs that is of a ſtrict and exact nature, then hell with heaven.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in the ſecond place, <hi>It argueth a tougue and an heart ſet on fire from</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. It is a great wickedneſs to reproach ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> 
                     <hi>hell, to reproach, and cry out againſt ſtrictneſs</hi> in the way to heaven. Oh that even among Chriſtians, there ſhould be men whoſe <hi>Throats are ſuch open ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres,</hi> as to ſend forth ſuch noiſome and filthy ſpeeches: What needs all this ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? What needs all this ſingularity? Why ſhould men refuſe to do as the moſt do? Is it not their pride and hypocriſie? Alas, ignorant and prophane wretch! What thinkeſt thou of that place, <hi>The Kingdom of heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force?</hi> What thinkeſt thou of that, <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate, for few enter therein?</hi> Are theſe places of Scripture true or no? if ſo, then wo be to thee, for thou makeſt the Kingdom of hell to ſuffer violence, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt that by force, though the Word, and Miniſter, and thy Conſcience be againſt thee: ſo thou that liveſt in diſſolute prophaneneſs, ordinary neglect of publique and private Duties, Is thy life ſuch a ſtrict life? Muſt there be ſuch ſtriving to do as thou doſt? Oh conſider, either Gods word is wrong, or thou art out of the way: thou art not yet ſuch an Atheiſt to aſſert the former, be therefore ſo far inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous as to acknowledge the latter.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, From hence it followeth, <hi>That the number of thoſe who are truely</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. The number of the Godly is very ſmall.</note> 
                     <hi>godly, are very few.</hi> They are but a little flock; and they are but few, not onely compatatively to the whole world, but in reſpect of titular and nominal Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who have the name, and own the profeſſion of Chriſt, but deny the <hi>power thereof. Many are called, but few are choſen,</hi> even few of thoſe that are called: as the gold is but little to the other part of the earth; &amp; flowers are few in reſpect of weeds: ſo that the ground why people do ſo eaſily perſwade themſelves of their good condition, is becauſe they underſtand not how exact and ſtrict the way of Grace is. You have this notably cleared <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 25. Where our Saviour ſhewing that it was <hi>as impoſſible for a rich man to be ſaved, as a Camel to go through the eye of a needle:</hi> becauſe its hard to have riches, and not to truſt in them, or love them immoderately; when his Diſciples heard this, ſaith the Text, <hi>They were exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly amazed, ſaying, Who then can be ſaved?</hi> They do not ſay, what rich man? but, who can be ſaved? becauſe as a rich man hath his riches, ſo every man hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other that his heart is too immoderately carried out after. Therefore ſay they, who can be ſaved? Oh beloved, while we look upon Gods gracious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Chriſts merciful invitations, while we think of his love in dying and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for us, we are apt to think it a very eaſie attainable thing to be ſaved, and no queſtion the Diſciples looked on theſe conſiderations, elſe they would not have ſo ſtartled, and been ſo amazed at Chriſts Doctrine: But then on the other ſide, when we conſider what ſtrict qualifications, what exact converſations cught to be in thoſe that go to heaven, we ſhall then ſtand amazed, ſaying, who can be God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? who can pray, hear, as the Scripture requireth theſe duties? Hence our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to allay the Diſciples aſtoniſhment, bringeth that univerſal Axiome, <hi>With men this is impoſſible, but with God all things are poſſible:</hi> the way there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to bring you to reſolve upon a more exact way of life, is to put you into this <note place="margin">4. The word of God alone reveals the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs of the way to heaven.</note> ſpiritual aſtoniſhment, and amazement at the accurate way of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, As the way to heaven is a moſt ſtrict and accurate way, <hi>So the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:30767:88"/>
word of God doth onely declare and reveal what that exactneſs is:</hi> So that as in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be beleeved there is no Doctrine can be urged as neceſſary, which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that writing: So in matters to be practiſed there is no degree, or high ſtrain of holineſs that is a duty, which is not alſo commanded in Gods word: thoſe two commands, one Negatively, <hi>Thou ſhalt not luſt</hi> the other affirmative, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and ſoul, and ſtrength,</hi> do command both for matter and manner, all that poſſibly can be done by man, and therefore can never be fulfilled in this life, becauſe of thoſe innate and adherent corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in us. <hi>I have ſeen an end of all things,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, But thy commandments are exceeding broad:</hi> they contain the whole duty of a man, and this particular is more to be obſerved, becauſe we are apt to go to extraordinary waies: as if the word of God were indeed a total and adequate rule for our faith, but not for our practice and converſation.</p>
                  <p>Hence, Fifthly, <hi>All ſtrictneſs introduced, that is not according to Scripture, how</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5 All other ſtrictneſs is to no purpoſe.</note> 
                     <hi>specious and glorious ſoever it may ſeem to be, yet it affords no true ſolis comfort to thoſe that are imployed therein.</hi> Now you muſt know, that as there is a proneneſs in men, curiouſly to pry into doctrinal matters above the word of God, to be wiſe above that which is written, ſo there is alſo an ithching inclination in us, to affect an holineſs above the Scripture, to bring in a greater ſtrictneſs then God hath required; not that it is indeed ſtrictneſs (as is to be ſhewed, but carnal looſeneſs) onely it hath the appearance ſo to the eyes of fleſh and blood: As for example, The <hi>Phariſees</hi> way that ſeemed to be more religious and exact, then the courſe our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our taught, and therefore they called him <hi>a wine bibber,</hi> and charged him for <hi>keeping company with ſinners:</hi> The <hi>Pharſees</hi> would not come near any ſuch prophane men: they would not go out, or come in, but they would firſt waſh themſelves, leaſt they ſhould get any uncleanneſs upon them. Here in outward appearance, they ſeemed to teach a more exact, and ſtrict way then Chriſt: though all this outward auſterity did flow from a poy oned, corrupted fountain within.</p>
                  <p>Let us <hi>inſtance in ſeveral waies whereby men may affect, and introduce an higher ſtrictneſs, then the Scripture ſpeaks of:</hi> And I ſhal not inſtance in falſe worſhip, which was a great part of Phariſaical ſtrictneſs, buſying themſelves in thoſe things God never required; for I ſhal ſpeak of that (God willing) in the next ſermon, becauſe it is the greater ſign by which many ſuperſtitious and ignorant people couſen their ſouls. I proceed therefore to other affectations of extraordinary ſtrictneſs, ſuch as theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>When the Scripture or word of God is accounted too low a thing to guid us,</hi>

                     <hi>and therefore they expect an higher, and more extraordinary teaching by the ſpirit of God, and that for other matter then is contained therein.</hi> It is true indeed, the word of God as it is Scripture, without the Spirit of God, cannot enlighten or change the heart: therefore theſe two muſt never be oppoſed, or disjoyned; but the word of God is the onely adequate rule, to which we are tyed, and the Spirit of God that work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in and by that: ſo that as God will not produce any extraordinary new mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial light to direct us bodily, but in and through the Sun, ſo the Spirit of God will not vouchſafe any new ſpiritual light, but in and through the Scriptures Hence it is, that although God be not bound himſelf, yet he hath bound us to that only: <hi>To the law, and to the Teſtimony,</hi> and <hi>ſearch the Scriptures:</hi> yea, <hi>Timothy</hi> muſt not look for infallible directions from <hi>Paul,</hi> but <hi>give himſelf to the ſtudie of the Scriptures, which were able to make him fully perfect for every good work.</hi> Now the Papiſt and Enthuſiaſt they both agree in this, to debaſe the Scripture, not to make it a full and perfect rule; to expect higher, and more noble teachings then are from that.

it <hi>Peſſimum idolum mundi,</hi> the worſt Idol in the world: and no wonder if they cry down the Scripture as being a low form, ſeeing ſome Anabaptiſts have denied the humane Nature of Chriſt, and called thoſe <hi>Creaturiſtas,</hi> Creaturiſts, that held it ſo: even as ſome complain that Chriſt is made a form, and that we ought not to ſtay on him but go immediately to the Father. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever theſe high things may ſeem to raviſh men, and but people in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to admiration: yet they are indeed low and falſe things: do not therefore grow weary of theſe plain Truths concerning faith and regeneration, or thoſe plain Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons that teach this; for thou wilt ſhortly come to be weary of the Scripture it ſelf, as too plain and mean a thing: That as ſome corrupt fancies have diſdained the Scripture (ſuch as <hi>Politian</hi> and <hi>Auſtin</hi> once confeſſed of himſelf) becauſe there was not humane eloquence enough in it: ſo theſe nauſeate the word of God upon another ground, as not having high and lofry Doctrines fit for their Eagle eyes. Therefore it is a miſerable thing to conſider how ſuch preachers, and people that are thus elevated up to cloudy things, do Torrure and perplex Scripture, to faſten their abſurd imaginations upon it: Alas, the cripture was not made for ſuch cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Aerial ſpeculations: Let not therefore ſuch go any longer a Tiptoe, as if no Chriſtian in all his glory were like to them, becauſe of their abſtruſe conceptions: for they are higher then others but as chimneys are higher then other parts of the houſe, that carry away empty, ſmoaky, obſcure vapours. I am the larger upon this, becauſe it is a great part of Grace to ſit down contented with the plainneſs and ſimplicity of Scripture, both for matter of it, and manner of delivery.</p>

The ſtring of the Inſtrument, if it be wet and not dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is not fit to make any melodious tune; no more is the body overmuch repleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with any pleaſure. We ſee <hi>Timothy</hi> going too far in the bodily diſcipline; Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth him <hi>To drink a little wine for his preſent infirmities. John Baptiſt,</hi> he alſo came in an auſtere way, <hi>his garments being of Camels hair, and his food locuſts:</hi> This way of his was different from Chriſts: nor is <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> an example to us; but his deportment was peculiar, as being moſt ſutable to him that was putting a period to the old Teſtament-diſpenſations.</p>
                  <p>Therefore all thoſe affected Auſterities of <gap reason="foreign">

Bodily exerciſe profiteth little, but godlineſs is profitable to all things.</hi> He makes a diſtinction between bodily exerciſe, and godlineſs; therefore one is not the other: Do not then meaſure thy hopes and aſſurances of heaven, though very ſpecious to a carnal eye, by ſuch outward ſtrict obſervances.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, An extraordinary ſtrictneſs which maketh men confident, <hi>Is a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary abdication, and actual dispoſſeſſing our ſelves of all outward comforts, and apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves onely to religious exerciſes.</hi> How did this miſtake ſeduce thouſands of devout ſouls, who were zealous for God, but wanted knowledge? Hence came thoſe Monaſteries, renouncing of riches, wealth, and whatſoever comfort was in this life: As if thoſe places, <hi>Unleſs a man forſake all, and deny himſelf, taking up the croſs and follow me,</hi> &amp;c. did command an actual abdication of all, and not rather an habitual preparation of heart to leave them all when God ſhall call for them. And if we read of Philoſophers that have thrown all their wealth away, that they might the better ſtudy Philoſophy, is it any wonder if a falſe zeal carry ſome to part with all, that according to their thoughts, they might the more expeditely come to the races end? It is true indeed, the Scripture commands ſuch ſtrictneſs in our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and deſires to all worldly comforts, <hi>That thoſe that have them muſt be as if they had them not:</hi> And who is there that can ſtand under thoſe exact commands of God herein? yet we may erre on the right hand, as well as on the left. Such were thoſe <hi>Euchetae,</hi> that gave themſelves onely to pray: And the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braiding the Orthodox with their impiety, and commending their own godlineſs, <hi>Nos formidamus divitias, We</hi> (ſay they) <hi>are afraid of riches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Men may judge their Spiritual conditions the better, <hi>Becauſe of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſtrictneſs in Church Diſcipline, and Church Dispenſations,</hi> when yet there is no ground at all for it: That there may be overmuch rigor in Diſcipline, appeareth plainly, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. where the Apoſtle blameth them, <hi>That they did not receive into favor that inceſtuous perſon, who had truely repented:</hi> And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle doth in part ſuppoſe it is part of Satans ſubtile devices, when he cannot deſtroy a Church by prophaneneſs, and diſſoluteneſs, to overthrow it by too much ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Now how many waies there may be an exceſs in rigid Church waies, we have upon another occaſion ſhewed: As when men hold onely perfect men; or if not ſo, only truely godly men to be admitted into Church-fellowſhip; and men, though qualified with ſufficient knowledge, and free from Scandal, to be debarred many priviledges: As alſo when they think men committing ſuch ſins, were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be received again; which was the error of <hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Donariſts:</hi> or if they did admit ſuch repenting, yet not for many years, in which exceſs the primitive Church did fall. Now all theſe Doctrines and Practices, having a ſpecious pretence of more ſtrictneſs, and exactneſs then others, is a temptation to many, that they build themſelves upon theſe waies and manners, not at all attending to the power and life of Godlineſs; this is a ſeaſonable Doctrine at this time. Oh, puff not up thy ſelf: do not conclude great things for thy ſelf, meerly becauſe thou judgeſt thy ſelf in a more ſtrict Doctrinal, or Church way then others. Alas theſe <hi>external waies profit little, but god lineſs profiteth to all purpoſes.</hi> Many times high principles, have
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:30767:91"/>
but low practices, and ſtrict opinions, ſometimes large converſations. Now the ground why theſe inſtituted, and introduced ſtrictneſſes, are not to be reſted upon, is becauſe they are not what they ſeem to be. We call them high things, but they are indeed low things; we call them ſtrict things, but they are indeed large and looſe things. For take this Phariſaical moſt exact and ſtraight way; alas, their hearts were large and looſe enough; ſo that all ſtrictneſſe, which is not commanded by Scripture, comes from a looſe principle, and tends to a looſe end: for it proceeds from a carnal heart, not acquieſcing in Gods word as a rule: it is not ſubject to Scripture directions, and then the end is carnal; for it is alwaies for ſome ſelf-ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, though it be in a ſubtile and crafty way.

Thou canſt not have bread for thy mouth without the ſweat of thy brows, and thinkeſt thou to have this prize with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out earneſt running in the race? Doſt thou think God will provide Salvation for thee, as he did a wife for <hi>Adam,</hi> by caſting thee in a dead ſleep, and thou know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor diſcern nothing of it?

                  <p>THe Text is part of an hiſtorical Narration, wherein is manifeſtly decipher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the envious and malicious diſpoſition of ſuperſtitious perſons and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites againſt the pure and upright, for here we have the Scribes and Phariſees, that were reputed the only Saints of the world, becauſe of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward devotion, quarrelling and conteſting with Chriſt, about the neglect of a ſuperſtitious cuſtome. So that you have their impeachment in the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe, <hi>Why walk not thy Diſciples according to the tradition of the Elders, that eat bread with unwaſhen hands?</hi> They do not ſay, Why is Gods Law, or <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law tranſgreſſed? but the tradition of the Elders. The Elders among the Jews had brought in under a ſpecious pretext of piety and religion, many devout cuſtoms and religious uſages, which they called <hi>Sepimenta legis,</hi> hedges to the Law of God, but they were indeed <hi>Impedimenta,</hi> for hereby Gods commands were fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated. Now among other traditions, this was introduced by them, that they did before they went to meals, or when they came home from buſineſſe abroad, waſh themſelves. The ground was, leſt they ſhould touch any thing unclean, and ſo be defiled unawares; hereupon alſo it was, that they uſed frequent waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as of themſelves; ſo alſo of <hi>Cups, Pots, Veſſels</hi> and <hi>Tables:</hi> where by the way we may obſerve <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to ſignifie in the general <hi>any waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and not <hi>dipping</hi> onely, as ſome contend. If you ask, Why our Saviour would not conform to ſuch a tradition, ſeeing there was no viſible appearance of evil in it, neither was it a ſinne to do ſo? <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> giveth this reaſon, becauſe thoſe that are intent to the moſt neceſſary and ſerious matters of Religion, uſe to neglect, what is ſuperſluous: but we may ſay, This tradition was uſed not upon civil reſpects, for ſo to waſh their hands was comely and decent before they eat bread, but upon religious conſiderations, hereby worſhipping God, and thinking thereby to approve themſelves more acceptably to him.</p>
                  <p>To this Accuſation of the Phariſees our Saviour anſwereth two waies:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By Recrimination, and then by Poſitive Information, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14, 15. My Text is part of the Recrimination, which conſiſts partly in application of <hi>Iſaiahs</hi> Prophecie to them, <hi>This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is farre from me.</hi> This was ſpoke to the Jews living in the Prophets time, but becauſe they were guilty of the ſame ſinne, he extendeth the Prophets ſpeech to all that are guilty of hypocriſie in the like kinde.</p>
                  <p>Again, Chriſts upbraiding is partly in the manifeſtation of the vanity and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitableneſſe of ſuch falſe worſhip, <hi>In vain do they worſhip me.</hi> The Hebrew word is <hi>Fear</hi> in the Prophet; but becauſe that is many times uſed for the whole
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:30767:92"/>
worſhip of God, therefore it is expounded ſo here. And although the word <hi>in vain</hi> is not uſed by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> yet the <hi>Septuagint</hi> hath it, and this ſenſe is neceſſarily implied by conſequence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That it is a vain and unprofitable ſign to ſupport and comfort our ſelves by, that we are diligent in the worſhip of God, if not commanded by him.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Phariſees made their obſervation of religious traditions to be the eminent ground of all their happineſſe. In this they placed all their Religion and Sanctity; whoſoever concurred not with them herein, was accounted prophane and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; but how light and empty is all this found, when <hi>weighed in the balance of the Sanctuary?</hi> And it is wonderfull to conſider, how in all the ages of the Church, this Phariſaical leaven, hath leavened moſt perſons. Inſomuch that Gods Commandments have been wholly laid aſide, while mens traditions have been admired; So that it is a true Aſſertion of <hi>Auguſtines, Sincerus Dei cultus apud paucos eſt,</hi> The ſincere and pure worſhip of God, is but among few. So that the diſcuſſion of this Point, will much clear the true Nature of the ſervice of God.</p>
                  <p>Therefore to be informed herein, conſider, <note place="margin">Several Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions about worſhipping of God. 1. It lieth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all as a duty</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That it lieth as a neceſſary duty upon all to worſhip and ſerve God.</hi> The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew words and Greek are ſeveral and obſervable, that expreſſe this worſhip, which are exactly handled among the learned; The ground of this worſhip is, <hi>Becauſe he is the Jehovah,</hi> who giveth us our being, and all other mercies: It is therefore moſt natural, and a moſt indiſpenſable debt to acknowledge him for his ſupream excellency herein, and to give him a peculiar and proper worſhip. Now this worſhip and ſervice is either <hi>internal,</hi> or <hi>external,</hi> or <hi>mixt,</hi> compounded of <note place="margin">Worſhip di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed.</note> both; <hi>internal</hi> conſiſts in our love of God above all things, Faith and Hope in him, Obedience to his commands, which the Scripture preferreth before all external worſhip; <hi>External</hi> is that of adoration and inclination of the body, kiſſing the hand, bowing the knee, dedicating Temples, Altars, and Offering of Sacrifices; <hi>Mixt</hi> is compounded of both theſe, ſuch as calling upon Gods name by Petition and Thankſgiving.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>This worſhip and ſervice of God is not given to God, becauſe he needs it,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. God needs no worſhip. It is for our own good.</note> 
                     <hi>or is made more happy thereby.</hi> This is a good conſideration to debaſe hypocrites who are ſo apt to ſwell and to be ſecure, becauſe of their worſhip of God. Thus <hi>David</hi> doth acknowledge that his <hi>good reacheth not to God.</hi> God is no more better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our worſhip, then the fountain is, becauſe a man drinks of it; or the Sun, becauſe a man ſeeth by the light of it. Such do not advantage the fountain, or the Sunne, but their own ſelves. So God hath appointed this worſhip, not that he might receive good from us, but communicate good to us. Thus God ſaith, <hi>The beaſts upon a thouſand hils are mine.</hi> God there ſheweth, he needed not their <note place="margin">Pſal. 50. 10, 11.</note> Sacrifices; This is a neceſſary truth, for hypocritical Formaliſts to meditate on. Thy worſhip of God conſiſts not in thy giving to him, but receiving from him. It is for thy own good and advantage that God hath appointed thee to hear, pray, and to be exerciſed in any godly duty.</p>

Hence are they ſo often blamed for a way of worſhip, which they chuſe of their own heads, and for walking after their own <hi>imaginations.</hi> The deformity of an Ape li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in being ſo like a man, and yet not a man; ſo doth the loathſomneſſe of all falſe worſhip lie in this, that it imitateth the worſhip of God, but indeed it is not ſo. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> acknowledgeth that of <hi>Socrates,</hi> as good and true, God muſt be worſhipped in that way only he hath appointed: And the ſame <hi>Auguſtine</hi> layeth down an excellent poſition, <hi>Erroris hoc eſt principium, quod quae placent nobis etiam Deo placere putamus; &amp; quae nobis diſplicent etiam Deo diſplicere.</hi> Nothing though it ſeem never ſo good, may be added to Gods precepts. Therefore in all worſhip, look to a warrant, elſe thy ſinne is very great. Hence <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. The <hi>Samaritans</hi> are ſaid <hi>to worſhip they know not what,</hi> becauſe they finde not Gods appointment for what they did.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Our Saviour doth excellently and briefly lay down what is accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <note place="margin">5. What it is to worſhip God in the Spirit.</note> worſhip unto him, <hi>

Thoſe that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and truth, and as a Father; ſuch worſhippers he ſeeketh for,</hi> though he needeth them not. To worſhip God in the Spirit, is to have a ſpiritual and holy inward frame of heart in all our addreſſes to him. This is worſhipping of God in a way the moſt of men are not acquainted with: The Jews and Phariſees were general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ignorant of this; <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Whom I ſerve in my Spirit.</hi> Oh it is an hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have a ſpiritual man in praier, hearing and other worſhip! And indeed this is the ſoul and life of the ſervice of God. The other way of worſhip is in truth, which by ſome is explained againſt hypocriſie and guile of Spirit; for this God complaineth of, <hi>That they drawed nigh with their mouths, but their hearts were farre from God.</hi> Laſtly, as a Father, they muſt worſhip, though humbly, <hi>yet not ſlaviſhly and ſervilely. Seneca</hi> ſpeaketh of the ſuperſtitious intimidated perſon, that while he worſhips God, he provoketh him, <hi>Quem colit, violat.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>all moral duties, that the obedience to them is required before any inſtituted worſhip. I will have mercy and not Sacrifice. Goe and learn what that meaneth,</hi> ſaith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. Inſomuch that comparatively to obedience, God is ſaid not to command theſe at all. And herein <hi>Samuel</hi> gives <hi>Saul</hi> a remarkable leſſon, <hi>Rebellion</hi> or <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience is like the ſinne of witchcraft. He hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good, to walk humbly, to do juſtly,</hi> &amp;c. Therefore how diligent and buſie ſoever thou art in outward worſhip, yet if not obedient to the known Commandments of God, thou canſt not be called a true worſhipper of God. Conſider this, you who live in groſſe ſins of ſwearing, lyings, filthy luſts, yet what a ſtirre doe you make for outward worſhip and ceremonies not commanded. If ſo be that God be to be worſhipped, why doth thy tongue blaſpheme him by curſes? Why doth thy body diſhonour him by filthy defilements? <hi>What haſt thou to doe</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>to take my words in thy mouth, and hateſt to be reformed?</hi> Oh remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber obedience is better then all bowings, inclinations and incurvations of the body!</p>

that <hi>Sixtinus Amama</hi> ſpeaks of a Papiſt, that confeſſeth he had need have <hi>inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium valde metaphyſicum,</hi> a moſt metaphyſical ingeny, that can underſtand all thoſe abſtractions and preciſions which are requiſite for the full conception of the manner of their worſhip. How do they colour over their worſhip of Angels and Saints, by making a two-fold religious worſhip, one primary, as to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all excellency, and ſo they acknowledge God only to be worſhipped: The other ſecondary as to inſtruments and mediators, yet ſtill they hold it religious. But divine worſhip appointed by God is indiviſible, like conjugal love. Hence falſe worſhip is ſo often compared to whoredoms and adulteries, and Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to jealouſie. Now as it would be no excuſe to a married woman, if ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit leudneſſe with another man, to ſay, ſhe keeps her primary love to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, for that were not lawful, no not in that woman in the ſtory, who yielded her ſelf to the luſt of another, to redeem her husband from captivity, though love to her husband put her upon this fact, yet it was not juſtifiable; ſo neither can any good intentions, or a loving heart to Gods glory and zeal for him, excuſe or legit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     </hi> yet God ſtruck him ſuddenly dead for that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion? If people were truly ſenſible of this, they would not ſo revile and rage at a Reformation as they do; What is more cheering and rejoycing a true godly man, then to ſee the pure adminiſtration of all Church-worſhip? And on the other ſide, nothing doth cut and pierce the heart of a carnal ſuperſtitious man more, then to have his ſuperſtitions removed: Then they think all Religion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved with it. Well, howſoever thy intentions are good, as thou ſaieſt, yet God accounts it ſo much worſhip done to Devils. It is ſaid of <hi>Jeroboam, His wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was to Devils.</hi> Alas did the people think ſo? Were not their intentions for the true God? But God calleth it worſhipping of Devils, for all falſe worſhip is brought in by the inſtigation of the Devils.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, <hi>God under the New Testament hath appointed all his worſhip in a plain</hi>

                        </gap> as the Serpent beguiled Hve, ſo your mindes ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicity of the Goſpel of Chriſt. Paul</hi> was afraid of this, the Devil is to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more as a glittering ſubtil Serpent, then a raging roaring Lion: and in nothing <note place="margin">2 Co. 11. 3.</note> doth his ſerpentine art appear more then in introducing worſhip that is pompous and ceremonious. As children love to play with babies; ſo do ignorant, carnal people with an external ſenſible worſhip. And the more ſpiritual any Ordinance, or the adminiſtration of it is, the leſſe glorious it is unto a corrupt heart; whereas a gracious heart ſeeth glorious Majeſty in ſpirituality. Chriſts preſence in the Temple, <hi>expounding, informing and reforming, made the ſecond Temple more glorious then the former,</hi> which did exceed in gold and other magnificence. As the paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a precious jewel hinders the native and proper luſtre of it. So doth humane pomp added to the pure inſtitutions of Chriſt take off from the innate beauty and glory of them. God indeed in the Old Teſtament appointed a ſolemn external worſhip, full of ſenſible glory and pomp, but it was becauſe they were infants, and children had rather have a baby then a rich inheritance. Expect therefore in the worſhip of God, that which may exerciſe thy faith, heavenly-mindedneſſe, and dependency upon God, which may make a divine impreſſion and ſtamp upon thy ſoul, not that which may raviſh thy eyes, and thy ears.</p>

about this ſin. The rage of a man is ſeen in his jealouſie, if wronged therein, he can leaſt bear it. And thus God deſcribeth himſelf about ſuperſtitious worſhip.

How then can that be a plea for thee, which will be the greateſt plea againſt thee?

That Antichriſtian ſpirit in Popery, whence is it? to believe a lie for truth; to take Idolatry for Religion, is it not becauſe men are given up to believe a lie? becauſe they loved not the truth And thus our Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> from whom our Text is alledged, ſpeaks of the blindneſs God had given theſe idolatrous Jews up unto, that they cannot underſtand nor know the minde of God: As therefore you have Gods judgements upon ſome to be delivered up to carnall groſſe ſins, which they cannot leave; ſo there are alſo ſome given up to ſpiritual deluſions and ſuperſtitions.</p>

                  <p>I ſhall take that doctrine for granted which the Orthodox prove againſt Papiſts and Socinians, <hi>viz.</hi> that in this Chapter our Saviour doth not as a Law-giver impoſe new commands, and duties, which were not obligatory in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament; but doth only vindicate the Law of God from corrupt gloſſes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations; ſo that although his doctrine and interpretation was new, through the default of thoſe corrupt traditionall Expoſitions, which the Phariſees had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered, yet it was not new indeed, for the ſame duties had alwaies been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. Our Saviour doth as the Painter, which doth not draw a new image or picture, only varniſheth it over, where the colour and beauty was loſt; He doth not dig up new fountains, but cleanſeth away that earth and mudd which theſe Phariſees had thrown in. The Lord Chriſt in this Chapter teacheth excellent and admirable purity and holineſſe, tranſcendent not only to Phariſaicall gloſſes, but to all the corrupt opinions and judgements of men, preſſing upon us heart-du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties above external obedience, and prohibiting inward and ſoul-ſinnes above out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward filthineſſe.

                  <p>In the next place there is the neceſſary requiſite to our righteouſneſſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that it doth exceed, abound, as the greek word, or encreaſe and be greater then that <hi>[of the Scribes and Phariſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

He doth not ſay, unleſſe your righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe be more then Publicans and Harlots, for that would eaſily be granted, but more then Scribes and Phariſees. Nor, unleſſe it be like and equall to that of the Phariſees, but unleſſe it exceed. This was extreamly offenſive and paradoxall, and it is, ſaith <hi>Muſculus,</hi> as if in the time of Popery a Preacher had ſaid, Unleſſe your righteouſneſſe exceed that of the <hi>Minorites</hi> and <hi>Carthuſians,</hi> you cannot be ſaved; Now the generall ground why the Phariſees obedience was inſufficient; was becauſe it conſiſted in an externall conformity to the Law, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

                     <hi>by men; yet it is no ſure evidence for heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To open this conſider theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That by externall obedience we mean an innocency or freedom from all groſſe vices.</hi> No drunkard, no whoremonger, no prodigall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the Phariſees made clean the outſide, howſoever inwardly their hearts were dens of theeviſh Iuſts: Now although this innocency be no ſymptome of grace; yet how many ſuch noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and filthy weeds grow in Chriſts garden! how many ſuch beaſtly ſwine are in Chriſts ſheepfold, ſins that ſhould not be named among Chriſtians, are yet pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed and boaſted of among them. What comfort and hopes caoſt thou have in thy conſcience, who carrieſt about with thee ſuch evident plague-tokens of Gods wrath? What do ſuch Crows among Chriſts Doves? What do ſuch Brambles a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his pleaſant plants? <hi>Depart ye workers of iniquity</hi> from Chriſtian aſſemblies for theſe know you not: God called you not to uncleanneſſe but unto holineſſe. Oh that theſe ſpots and reproaches of Chriſtianity were once purged away from us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>By this morall obedience we mean a fair externall conformity</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. An exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the firſt and ſecond Table.</note> 
                     <hi>both unto the duties of the firſt and ſecond Table:</hi> ſo that they have the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward lineaments both of piety and righteouſneſſe. For thus the Phariſees they were carefull about the externall worſhip of God, how zealous about the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> charging the pollution thereof upon Chriſt! and as for morall du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties among men, had they not excelled therein, they could not have enjoyed ſuch admiration and applauſe of men. It is true, our Saviour made them the worſt of men, pulling off their vizards and diſcovering their pride and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous ends in all they did: but though they were inwardly <hi>ravening wolves,</hi> yet out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly they ſeemed innocent ſheep. Hence our Saviour called them hypocrites ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall times together; If therefore you have a man that is carefull in duties to man, faithfull in his word, juſt in his dealings, but neglective of Gods worſhip, a prophane deſpiſer of the Sabbath; this man is not to be accounted ſo much as a morall righteous man, Again, if you ſee a man ſtrict about the worſhip of God, in keeping of the Sabbath, in writing and repeating of Sermons, yet unjuſt and deceitfull in his doings, this man riſeth not ſo high as this Phariſaicall righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. That which muſt be exceeded is an univerſall, generall conformity unto all the Commandements of God.</p>
                  <p>Therefore thirdly, <hi>That wherein this morall obedience to all the Commandments</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. Wherein this obedience is defective.</note> 
                     <hi>of God is defective in, is, that it is a body without a ſoul,</hi> a ſhell without a kernell, a picture without life, there is nothing but an outward ſhape of righteouſneſſe; as for a principle of regeneration, <hi>and a new life within, that is wholly abſent.</hi> Now this was the fundamentall miſcarriage of the Phariſees, as appeareth by <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> they were wholly ignorant of originall corruption. They beleeved not that all was carnall and defiled within them, and thereupon ſaw no neceſſity of being born again, of having a new nature infuſed into us, and ſo become new creatures. And this is the rock upon which thouſands ſplit their immortall ſouls ſtill. They pleaſe themſelves thus, I live honeſtly, I do juſtly to every one, I frequent the Church, and receive the Ordinances of God, what further thing is there to be done? I thank God no man can accuſe me, nor doth my conſcience accuſe me. But in the mean while, are miſerable ſeduced men, and are at that very time, in the ſtate of gall and wormwood; <hi>Paul</hi> though he walked with a <hi>good conſcience,</hi> and <hi>concerning the righteouſneſſe of the Law unblameable:</hi> yet when God inlightned his ſoul, what a heavy doom did he paſſe upon himſelf, and called all that <hi>dung,</hi> which he judged gold once! Therefore herein is the danger of meer morall obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, that it is like a glorious houſe without any foundation, a fair apple with a rotten kore, a comely beautifull face with impoſtumed vitals.</p>

                     <hi>Saint,</hi> and admired by them: for he having only the lineaments and form of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, without the power and activity of it, hence it is that he is the more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of the world; Whereas if he had the vigorous life of grace, and were zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the glory of God, and active to pull down the kingdom of ſin and Satan, then all the rage and hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ed of the world would be derived on him. Look upon Chriſt and his converſation, there was more righteouſneſſe, holineſſe, patience, meekneſſe, and all lovelineſſe in him, then in the ſtricteſt Phariſee: Yet the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple generally preferred a Phariſee before him, becauſe the one had but the picture of godlineſſe, and the other the lively expreſſion of it, which is very offenſive and troubleſome to a carnall heart. Hence the world ſaith, give me an honeſt, quiet, peaceable man, that troubleth us not for our drunkenneſſe, wickedneſſe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched courſes; but as for theſe ſtrict, preciſe, zealous men, what have we to do with them?</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Although external obedience and outward actions of piety are not to be reſted</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5. Yet exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal obedience is neceſſary. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>on, yet this external obedience is neceſſary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Becauſe outward actions are a complement and a perfection of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward habits of grace; God hath put all the internal habits of grace in the heart, that they might produce externall operations in our lives, and when they do ſo, they attain their ultimate perfection. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> placed happineſſe in the actions of the ſoul, not in habits and faculties, becauſe they are not moſt excellent: It is not therefore enough for a man to pleaſe himſelf with contemplative good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, but he is alſo to demonſtrate his grace in the powerfull operations thereof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Outward acts of obedience are neceſſary becauſe the commands of God do eſpecially oblige to theſe. Thus thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, and <note place="margin">2.</note> this is his commandment to beleeve on him: Howſoever therefore that actions are not ſufficient, unleſſe they flow from ſupernaturall principles within, and an inward rectitude of the frame of the heart; yet the commands of God do binde to theſe, as thoſe whereby God is moſt glorified, it being not the having of a thing ſo much as the exerciſing of it, which makes us acceptable to him that imployeth us therein.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Outward acts of obedience are neceſſary, becauſe theſe do corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate <note place="margin">3.</note> and ſtrengthen grace within. The frequent exerciſe of outward duties do greatly confirm the inward principle of grace. Even as it is in ſinne, the outward acting and daily committing of ſinne doth encreaſe and inhance the power of ſinne within. Hence ſins we have been long practiſed in, become like an old Oak, that is hardly removed out of its place: Such devils as poſſeſſe us from the youth up, are not caſt out without praier and faſting. Thus it is alſo in the works of grace, and outward obedience, the more diligent and frequent we are in them, the more doth our inward man grow ſtronger and ſtronger.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. They are neceſſary in reſpect of others, <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may glorifie your Father which is in heaven:</hi> We ought by our outward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation <note place="margin">4.</note> to draw on others to godlineſſe, and to give good examples in our exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, that men may not learn from thee to curſe, drink, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

Thus you ſee, that howſoever outward obedience be not foundation ſure enough to build thy hopes of heaven upon, yet it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in its kinde, and therefore the want of this doth diſcover two kinde of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites.</p>

It is therefore a wofull condition to live a man ignorant of the heart-change that ſhould be in thee. Thou haſt been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, but now thy life is changed; Thou didſt commit ſuch and ſuch ſinneſ, but now thou haſt left them, This is well, but if a greater change and alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath not been made in thy ſoul, thou art yet in a ſtate of ſinne and wrath, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, and fear leſt God have not wrought ſuch a glorious work within thee as is neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond ſad conſequent is <hi>the neglect of Chriſt and all his offices;</hi> for as a man <note place="margin">2.</note> is trained up in this externall obedience, and thinketh the Law requireth no more, he ſeeth no need of Chriſt; He findes not the heavy and weighty curſes of the law hanging over him, but is ſecure and quiet, as if all were ſafe and well; <hi>Come unto me ye that are heavy laden, and I will eaſe you.</hi> Till a man finde a load upon his ſoul, he deſireth no eaſe: Ye are they that juſtifie your ſelves, ſaith our Saviour: hence they ſought to eſtabliſh their <hi>own righteouſneſſe,</hi> and would not <hi>ſubmit to the righteouſneſſe of Christ:</hi> ſo that what Atheiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Theſe make Chriſt in vain, his life and death in vain, and all the glorious riches of Gods wiſedom and grace in the Goſpel a meer figment.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Here is this evill effect alſo, <hi>that purity and holineſſe of heart which God</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note>

Hence all this obedience is but a work of nature, not of the holy Ghoſt, and ſo come far ſhort of the excellent frame God requireth.</p>
                  <p>In the third place let us examine the grounds, why it is no ſafety to reſt upon ſuch outward obedience. <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="4 words">

                  </p>
                  <p>And the firſt is, <hi>From thoſe many cauſes which may produce this outward righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:30767:96"/>
that come ſhort of a true ground:</hi> As firſt, this externall freedom from ſin <note place="margin">Whenee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal freedom from ſin may proceed. 1.</note> may ariſe only from the reſtraining providence of God, which as it hath put bounds and limits to the ſea, that it overflow not the earth, ſo alſo doth ſtint the corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption of man, that he doth not ſin ſo much as his corrupt nature would carry him to. That every man is not a <hi>Cain,</hi> a <hi>Judas,</hi> an <hi>Abſalom,</hi> comes from the mercy of God determining and ordering mens ſinnes. As on the other ſide, it was from God that ſo many <hi>Romans</hi> were endowed with morall vertues in a glorious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. <hi>Abimelech</hi> was ready to fall into whoredome, not knowing any thing, and God by his providence meerly prevented him. Do not therefore preſently build thy hopes, becauſe thy life is a good and an honeſt life. Thou haſt not thoſe ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes and ſpots upon thee which others have, whence comes all this? is it from grace reſtraining or grace ſanctifying? Is it from the love of God checking thy corruptions, or changing thy heart?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, If thy righteouſneſſe come not thus, then it may be from the ſole power of naturall conſcience and humane ſtrength: for although it be true that <note place="margin">2.</note> by the ſtrength of nature we are not able to do any thing ſupernaturally good, but there muſt be antecedent to ſuch an action ſpirituall illumination of the minde, and a powerfull alteration of the heart: yet thoſe things that are good in a civill, or politicall ſenſe, and ſo, good for the matter, may be done by the naturall dictates of conſcience, ſuch implantations are made in man, that he beleeveth There is a God, That parents are to be honoured and ſuccoured in neceſſity. Now according to that natural light we have about God and a conſcience perſwading to it, there may alſo be a natural proſecution of the ſame good; But all this is wholly within the ſphere of nature, not above it. Art thou then a man doing all the works of moral righteouſneſſe? Conſider from what ſtock this groweth, from what foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this ſtreameth, Doth it ariſe from any other principle, but meerly that of a naturall conſcience? and if ſo, this cannot be a plaiſter to any ſoar, or a balm to any wound. As good Saints as theſe grow of themſelves in the heatheniſh parts of the world.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This outward innocency and righteouſneſſe may be meerly for want of a temptation. The heart is ready enough to conceive ſuch monſters, but theſe <note place="margin">3.</note> want objects to cauſe this. We ſee in Scripture ſuch ſinnes latitant in our breaſts, which will break forth by the midwifry of opportunities, that a man before would abhorre the very thoughts of them, as in <hi>Hazael</hi> and <hi>Peter.</hi> Hence the Diſciples were warned by Chriſt to take heed of drunkenneſſe, a ſinne that proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the diſciples were far remote from, yet for all that occaſions might kindle ſuch luſt in their hearts; It is not therefore preſently to be concluded that all is well, becauſe our lives are unblameable, for it's not from any goodneſſe within, but from defect of matter without. We ſee the hedges and ſprings of wood are free from ſnakes and venimous creatures in the winter time, but it is not becauſe they are not a fit boſome to nouriſh them, but there wants the Sun-beams to warm and revive them. As godly men many times would do good, but they cannot becauſe they want the objects and opportunities thereof: ſo alſo wicked men many times have hearts prepared to do a great deal of evil, but theſe mad men have not thoſe ſwords ready whereby they would deſtroy themſelves and others.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Therefore may thy converſation be ſo laudable, becauſe the fear of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane laws and puniſhments, or elſe Gods judgements are like a fiery ſword to <note place="margin">4.</note> keep thee off, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. Magiſtrates are a terrour to thoſe that do evill, ſo that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men are not ſo unclean, unjuſt, as they would be, becauſe the Magiſtrates ſword affrights them: and truly it's a great mercy, when in a kingdom men are neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to do things that are good and righteous; The end of all civill puniſhments is, that others may ſee and be afraid, and do no ſuch thing: ſo that many a mans externall conformity to good things is from the laws of the kingdom, wherein he liveth: or if theſe do not curb him, ſometimes the heavy judgements of God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending over him make him, to do his duty. Thus <hi>Ahab,</hi> when he feared no humane
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:30767:97"/>
laws to puniſh him, yet <hi>he humbled himſelf and mourned before God,</hi> becauſe of Gods judgements that were almoſt devouring him; if then a mans outward Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience may ariſe from ſo many various grounds, and they all rotten and corrupt, What comfort can a man take from it? Therefore unleſſe beyond and above all theſe, there be an heavenly and ſupernatural principle within thee, moulding and forming thy outward converſation, thou art not to live quietly in ſuch an eſtate, but ſeek out for a redreſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>External Obedience cannot be ground ſure enough to ſtand upon, becauſe it is not ſuch which doth anſwer the command of God.</hi> There is a two-fold <note place="margin">2.</note> Obedience to the Law accepted of by God; The one is perfect without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect at all; and thus the Law of God is not ſatisfied by any; The other is true and ſincere, but being imperfect the defects are pardoned by Chriſt. But exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Obedience meerly, is not that true Obedience required by the Law; I doe not ſay, the Perfect, but the True; and the reaſon is, becauſe the Law is <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi> and ſo reacheth primarily to the hearts and ſpirits of men; and God calleth for them, yea he rejects all external addreſſes to him without this; and therefore being this Obedience, this Righteouſneſſe, this Piety, is not ſuch as the Law would have; therefore think not to put off thy braſſe for gold; God is not like old <hi>Iſaac,</hi> that takes <hi>Jacob</hi> for <hi>Eſau,</hi> he regards not the garments thou haſt on, but looketh into thy heart.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Meer outward morality will not afford any comfort, becauſe this is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with a profeſſed hatred of, and enmity to the practical power of Godlineſſe.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> Therefore it's not godlineſſe, for like would never hate like. Yea it's an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that all that righteouſneſſe is but a carnal, earthly, fleſhly righteouſneſſe, becauſe ſo oppoſite unto that which is true godlineſſe; Now experience will abundantly confirm this, that none commonly are ſuch enemies and bitter ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to the waies and life of godlineſſe, as thoſe that are meer civil righteous men: What needeth all this zeal, all this forwardneſſe, all this exactneſſe (ſay they?) Hence they can no more abide a powerfull and ſoul-ſearching Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, then prophane wicked men; yea Chriſt and his Apoſtles had not ſuch op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and perſecution from prophane Publicans, as from thoſe righteous Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>It is not true Righteouſneſſe, and therefore he that thinks himſelf happy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>of this, is as if a man ſhould judge himſelf rich, becauſe of a coffer of braſſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> It is not true, partly becauſe its but the outſide only, the external lineaments, <hi>There is not the inward ſoul and life of godlineſſe,</hi> partly becauſe this is not the image of God, which properly is true holines, for the image of God conſiſteth not in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily actions, but in the actions of the Spirit after a godly and holy manner. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as in all your earthly commodities you buy, you examine whether it be the right and true commodity indeed, you would not have that which is ſophiſticate: ſo do here. Here are in the world many pretences to righteouſneſſe; ſome judge this godlineſſe, ſome judge that, others think this is enough, others that it is not enough. Let me therefore make a diligent ſearch hereinto. For the word of God that onely is the ſtandard to diſcover what is true, and what is coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>This is not true grace, becauſe all this external Obedience is done with eaſe and facility:</hi> There is no ſtrugling or wraſtling by the contrary corruption, <note place="margin">5.</note> whereas in all godly actions, <hi>The fleſh lusteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh, ſo that we cannot do the things we would.</hi> It is in matters of good to be done, as in truths to be believed; if a man aſſent to a concluſion in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, drawn by the meer power of reaſon, there is no difficulty to believe it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is ſutable to our nature, but if he do it, becauſe of Gods word, then he findes difficulty, for here is a ſupernatural motive; ſo if a man do that which is good upon humane motives, here is no contrariety in him, but if car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out upon heavenly conſiderations, then the unregenerate part gain-ſayes.</p>

The Scripture ſigns and ſymptoms of grace they have none at all, onely they pleaſe themſelves with falſe evidences of their own; and as counterfeit pearls do many times gliſter more then true ones, ſo falſe ſigns of grace many times make a greater dazeling then true ones. We are to bleſſe God that he reſtraineth mens corruptions, that men are of honeſt, civil, righteous deportment, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Commonwealths would become robberies, and men would be wolves to one another. Only this is not enough for Heaven; we may ſay even to ſuch a man, as well as to a prophane man, <hi>Unleſſe thou beeſt born again, ye cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> And unleſſe your righteouſneſſe be a better then this, there is no ſalvation for thee.</p>

                     <bibl>JAMES 2. 26.</bibl>
                     <q>For as the Body without the Spirit is dead; ſo Faith without Works is dead alſo.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>HOwſoever the Apoſtle his ſcope in this Chapter be much controverted, yet <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. doth manifeſtly evidence his purpoſe, which is to take off Titular Believers, who glory in the Name and Profeſſion of Faith from all their confident boaſting, if their Faith be not accompanied with an holy and godly life. Some think this dangerous miſtake grew from a miſunderſtanding of many places in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, where he ſeemeth only to ſet up Faith, and makes no matter of Sanctification. Whereupon the reconciliation of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> theſe two great Apoſtles, hath to all ſeemed very difficult; to others impoſſible, who therefore have expunged this Epiſtle out of the Canon.</p>
                  <p>I will not trouble you with the ſeveral waies of Reconciliation endeavoured by the learned; That which I ſhall pitch upon is this, That <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of Faith in it's relation to Juſtification, conſidering it only in that act, ſhewing that Faith onely, and no other grace juſtifieth. <hi>James</hi> demonſtrateth what kinde of Faith this is, <hi>viz.</hi> an actual operative one, which puts a man upon all holy duties. <hi>Paul</hi> proveth that Faith alone juſtifieth, and <hi>James,</hi> that this Faith which doth only ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, is not alone, but accompanied with other graces. <hi>Paul</hi> argueth againſt a Phariſee that ſets up his own works againſt Faith, <hi>James</hi> argueth againſt a carnal Goſpeller or Publican, that thinketh a bare profeſſion will ſave. Nor is it any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſuch an errour ſpread, That a man by his Faith only ſhould inherit hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſeeing even in <hi>Auguſtines</hi> time it was a general opinion, which that Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did with much fear and modeſty gain-ſay, <hi>That every Chriſtian, in that he was a Chriſtian, though a drunkard, whoremonger,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>would be ſaved?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle uſeth ſeveral weighty arguments to overthrow ſuch a vain
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:30767:98"/>
confidence, in all which he doth not derogate from Faith, but diſcover Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
                  <p>For in the firſt place, to ſhew the weakneſſe of ſuch a profeſſion of Faith, he compareth it with a profeſſion of Charity, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15, 16. If one give good words to a brother in need, bid him, <hi>Depart in peace,</hi> be warmed and filled, but give him nothing, would not this be ridiculous? So thou believeſt there is a God, a hell, a day of judgement, but liveſt in prophaneneſſe and impiety, Is not this thy Faith a mockery?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, He compareth this Faith with that of the Devils, and ſheweth the Devils go further then ſuch looſe Chriſtians; they believe a God and tremble, but ſo do not many diſſolute believers: how Devils believe, and whether an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites faith goeth further then theirs, are noble Queſtions, but not at this time to be diſcuſſed?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He proveth the inſufficiency of ſuch a Faith from <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith, the pattern of all: <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith that juſtified him, was a working faith, it made him offer up his onely Sonne, when God commanded him. That very place which <hi>Paul</hi> brings to prove <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by faith, <hi>James</hi> brings to prove, that this faith was not alone, but working eminently.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, In my Text, The Apoſtle argueth <hi>à ſimili,</hi> from a ſimilitude, as the <hi>Body without the Spirit is dead, ſo is Faith without Works.</hi> By Spirit, ſome under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand breath, and ſo they think, that as without breath the body is diſcovered to be dead, ſo without holy works faith is declared to be dead; and this they doe, leſt it ſhould be thought, that as the ſoul is the form of the body, ſo a godly life ſhould be the form of faith: Whereas indeed by other places, Faith is the form or efficient rather of holineſſe; and therefore Faith is much rather to be compared to the ſoul, for it's that which animateth all our actions, and makes them acceptable to God. But we may retain the word Spirit, underſtanding it of the Soul, for the Apoſtle doth not conſider a man here <hi>ad intra,</hi> in reſpect of God and Juſtification, but <hi>ad extra,</hi> in reſpect of others, and the declaration of his Juſtification. And ſo the ſenſe, as the body is known to be dead, if we perceive no vital or animal actions flowing from the ſoul, we perceive it not breathe, ſtir, or move; ſo is a mans faith dead, if we ſee it not demonſtrated by effectual opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the way of grace. Thus as it was in Chriſt, his Divine Nature, which was hidden, became manifeſt by thoſe miraculous operations he wrought, that none elſe could do; ſo faith is latent in a man, and breaks out in the diſcovery of it ſelf by an holy life; and in this ſenſe Faith is ſaid to be made <hi>perfect by works, viz.</hi> declaratively, and by manifeſtation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That a divine Faith, or perſwaſion of the truths in Religion, is not evidence ſure</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> 
                     <hi>enough of our being in the ſtate of grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Orthodoxy is not enough for Heaven. To be a good ſound Proteſtant and no more, will not carry us out of the wilderneſſe into <hi>Canaan.</hi> To have a ſound judgement, but an ungodly life, is to be like the Toad, which they ſay hath a Pearl in her head, but her body is full of poyſon. It is not enough to ſay, You thank God you are none of the Hereticks or Sectaries, unleſſe alſo you can ſay, You are none of the ſwearers, proud, prophane men. We may by experience obſerve what a ſtrong ſupport this is to many men, when they die, that they die in the true faith, they die no Papiſts, no Arminians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now although when errors creep in, as the Frogs once did into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> getting into every houſe and chamber almoſt, it be a great mercy to be preſerved in the truth, and that alſo by truth we come to grace; yet becauſe there are too many Solifidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as the Papiſts calumniate the Proteſtants Doctrine, men who relie onely upon this, that they are of the Reformed Religion, but yet are not of a Reformed Converſation, it is neceſſary to drive this Point home to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heart.</p>
                  <p>For the opening of it, conſider theſe particulars:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:30767:98"/>
Firſt, That although the word <hi>Faith</hi> be of a very vaſt ſignification in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <note place="margin">1.</note> yet this diſtinction is neceſſary to be obſerved; Faith is either taken for the Object which we do believe, or the true Doctrine; in which ſenſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle cals it <hi>one Faith,</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> exhorts <hi>to contend for the Faith.</hi> Though <hi>Junius</hi> very improbably would interpret that of the act of Faith, expreſly rejecting that Expoſition of the Doctrine of Faith. This was afterwards called Dogmaticall and Catholick Faith, or <hi>Fides quae creditur;</hi> or ſecondly, it is taken for that act of the ſoul, whereby we give aſſent unto truths revealed in Gods word, and this is in the heart, not Catholick, but Perſonal and particular; and in this ſenſe the word is moſt commonly taken, and this is <hi>Fides qua creditur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, This Faith thus in the minde and heart of men, is by the Orthodox <note place="margin">2.</note> divided into an <hi>Hiſtorical Faith,</hi> not called ſo becauſe they believe the Scripture for the Authority of the Hiſtory-writer, nor becauſe it believeth the Hiſtory of the Scripture onely, for it believeth the threatnings and Promiſes alſo, but becauſe the hiſtorical part is the greater part in quantity of the object believed. 2. A miraculous faith. 3. A temporary, 4 A juſtifying: by which diviſion the learned do not diſtribute an univocal genus into its diſtinct ſpecies, but onely groſſely lay down this difference, for in a juſtified perſon its the ſame habit of faith that believeth the Hiſtory, and particularly applieth the promiſes of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification, the one being a general act, the other ſpecifical. The Papiſts ſcorn at this diſtinction. To the Proteſtants, ſaith <hi>Maldonate, Tot ſunt ſides. quet in Lyra,</hi> jeſting upon the word <hi>Faith:</hi> The Proteſtants have as many ſaiths, as there be Fiddle ſtrings upon a Fiddle; but the Scripture compels us to make ſuch a diſtinction; for we read of many who are ſaid to believe in the Scripture, who yet had not a true lively work of grace upon them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To Faith or believing, there are three acts required, Knowledge, Aſſent <note place="margin">3.</note> and fiducial Application; Hence its uſual with the Scripture to deſcribe faith by one of theſe acts, not excluding but ſuppoſing the other, as, <hi>This is eternal life, to know thee,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 3. by knowledge is meant the powerfull receiving of Chriſt into our hearts, and herein doth this hiſtorical faith come ſhort, becauſe its not ſo fiducial, and ſo receptive of Chriſt, the fountain of life, as it ſhould be; and in this act its ſaid to juſtifie, compared therefore by Divines to the hand, to the eye, to the glaſſe-window in the houſe that only lets in light; to the navel by which the childe in the mothers belly liveth and obtaineth all its nouriſhment; but we at this time ſpeak of faith in the ſecond act as it is aſſenſitive, and giveth credence to the truths of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Our aſſent and perſwaſion of the truth in matters of Religion, may be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">4.</note> humane meerly, becauſe of cuſtome, education, and the Authority of the Church: or divine, being enclined and moved thereunto, becauſe of Divine Authority. This diſtinction is much to be obſerved, becauſe its to be feared, that moſt Proteſtants have no more then a humane faith. They believe our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion upon no more divine ground then Papiſts theirs, or Turks theirs. It is the Religion of their Fathers, and of the State and Commonwealth wherein they live. Thus you ſee how in King <hi>Edwards</hi> daies the generality of the Kingdome turned Proteſtants, and in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> Papiſts, why ſo? but becauſe their Religion was placed as the <hi>Heathens</hi> did <hi>Fortune</hi> upon a round Globe, which quickly moved this way, and the other. But Divine Faith hath this ground, <hi>The Lord hath ſaid it.</hi> And as a man ſeeth the Sunne by the light of the Sunne; ſo they believe the truths in Scripture, becauſe of that Divine Authority ſhining therein, I do not therefore ſpeak of an humane faith in matters of Religion, but a divine faith, whereby men are inabled upon ſupernatural grounds to believe the truths of God revealed; for faith is <hi>the gift of God,</hi> and that in all the acts of it, Knowledge, Aſſent and fiducial Application, and the Spirit of God doth ſo enlighten the minds of many unregenerate men, that they believe the word of God, as Gods word, and yet for all that, are not in a ſoul-ſaving way united to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:30767:99"/>
Chriſt. It may indeed be well doubted, and ſome Divines incline that way, that no unregenerate man hath ſo much as an hiſtoricall faith, as infuſed by God in them, and acting upon divine motives: only they ſay, they have an humane aſſent, as we ſpake of. But becauſe the current of learned men go otherwiſe, and we ſee the Scripture expreſly ſaying, that many did beleeve in him, who yet did not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie vain-glory, and ſinfull fear of men, therefore we ſhall take it for granted, that they have a divine faith, though not juſtifying.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This hiſtoricall faith, though it be not enough to Juſtification and ſalvation, <note place="margin">5. Hiſtoricall faith abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary.</note> yet it's abſolutely neceſſary, and is to be laid down as the foundation. The ground why men living under the Miniſtry are damned, is becauſe they have not ſo much as hiſtoricall faith. <hi>Who hath beleeved our report?</hi> They do not firmly beleeve that there is a God, that there is an hell, that the threatnings of God are true; for if ſo, what fear, what great alterations would this make upon them! We ſee what humane faith will do, if a man beleeveth that he is in ſuch danger, that ſuch enemies lie in wait to kill him, that he is condemned by the Law to death, how reſtleſſe and troubled is his ſoul? how much more would the heart of a ſinner quake within him, if he did beleeve That Word of God which doth thus threaten and damn my ſins is infallibly true, it will be made good, do I what I can: heaven and earth will ſooner fall to pieces then one iota or tittle of it: Whether ſhall I fly from it? how ſhall I eſcape it? Theſe vehement workings of faith would be like fire in his bowels, burning and conſuming him, till he be cooled by the bloud of Chriſt. Therefore though this faith be not enough, yet here is no building without this foundation.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This hiſtoricall faith though in ſome reſpects it be like that of the devils, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially becauſe of the barrenneſſe and unfruitfullneſſe of it: yet it is in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects <note place="margin">6. Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this faith and that of the devils.</note> farre different: for this faith is an habit infuſed into the beleever, and ſo wrought by God, but in the devils it's from evident experience, ſo that it's not a voluntary but a neceſſary faith, for they being already in torments, and finding part of their torments already inflicted upon them, they are forced to believe there is a God. Now although this be ſo, yet we may with the Apoſtle make a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of both of them together, and thus farre argue, that if the meer acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging and beleeving of the matters of religion were enough, then the devils might be ſaved as well as ſuch beleevers.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Although faith hath knowledge (for a man cannot beleeve that which he hath not either <hi>evidentiam rei,</hi> or <hi>evidentiam testimonij</hi> at leaſt. The Trinity though <note place="margin">7.</note> it hath not evidence of the thing, yet it hath evidence of the teſtimony plainly in Scripture) yet that knowledge is not by demonſtration, which Philoſophers call <hi>ſcientia ſtrictly,</hi> and therefore is obtained not ſo much by diſputation as reſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>bringing the underſtanding into captivity,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: and this ſhould be thought on by theſe ſceptique times, who are buſied in knowing but not in aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which makes them ſo fickle and unconſtant: <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, that not <hi>intelligendi vivacitas,</hi> but <hi>credendi ſimplicitas tutam facit turbam;</hi> but how many like thoſe <hi>Valentinians Irenaeus</hi> ſpeaks of are puft up with arrogancy and pride in knowledge, as if they could number the hair of a mans head, and tell the ſtars in the heavens, or the ſand on the ſea ſhore!</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It cannot be denied but that the Scripture doth attribute ſalvation in ſome places even to this hiſtoricall faith, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9, 28. Chriſt required only of that <note place="margin">8.</note> blinde man, a faith that he was able to help him; ſo <hi>Luke 7. 9. Mat.</hi> 8. 10. The faith of the Centurion ſo much commended, ſeemeth only to be of the hiſtoricall truth of Chriſts Divinity and omnipotency. <hi>Peters</hi> faith which Chriſt ſo praiſed, was only, <hi>Thou art the Son of the living God:</hi> ſo <hi>Martha's</hi> faith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11. 26. and that is remarkable, 1 <hi>John 5. 1. Every one that beleeveth that Jeſus is Chriſt, is born of God.</hi> Theſe and the like places make Papiſts conclude that all the juſtifying faith that is, is to beleeve theſe truths only: yea <hi>Arminius,</hi> and I wiſh not too many of late, hold this to be ſaving and juſtifying faith, when we beleeve that Jeſus Chriſt is the Mediatour, and will ſave all thoſe that beleeve in him, and they are not a|

to ſay, that <hi>Abraham</hi> beleeved no more: I am not now to confute this unſound Tenet; only take notice, That the reaſon why the Scripture ſometimes attributeth ſalvation to the meer beleeving of Jeſus Chriſt to be God, was becauſe the only queſtion then was about the perſon of Chriſt, not the office of Chriſt; The godly doubted not whether if he were the Chriſt he would be a King and Prieſt to them, but whether he was the Chriſt or no; and becauſe it was ſo great a matter to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve him to be the promiſed Meſſiah, who was outwardly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>it is, This reacheth no further then to the perfecting of the underſtanding.</hi> Whereas full ſaving faith <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. is fixed in the heart, <hi>with the heart man beleeveth,</hi> ſo purifying their hearts by faith, and Chriſt dwels in our hearts by faith; ſo that faith extending no further then to the underſtanding, cannot bring that happineſs the Word ſpeaks of. A man of a ſound brain, but corrupt vitals, will quickly go down to the gates of death. Now this is the generall temper of moſt Proteſtants, They have no further work then upon their underſtandings, many times their lives are as noiſome as dunghils; Men are Proteſtants in doctrines, and recuſants in lives, becauſe they refuſe the yoke of Chriſt, and will not ſubmit to his Law. Hell is filled not only with Pagans and Heathens, but ungodly Chriſtians: Truth like <hi>Aarons</hi> oil muſt not be powred upon the head only, but run down to the heart and other parts: The Orthodox were called Proteſtants firſt, becauſe at the beginning of reformation they made a ſolemn proteſtation againſt thoſe Articles of Popiſh Religion, which were to be eſtabliſhed: but what if thy tongue proteſt for the truth, and thy life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt it?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>There is a defect in its acts, for although this faith carrieth us out to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>it as true, yet not to embrace it as good;</hi> Whereas the Word of God is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly faithfull, but worthy of all acceptation: It's a frigid expoſition to ſay, that faith it called the ſubſtance of things, becauſe it makes them to ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſiſt in us by way of underſtanding meerly; no, it cauſeth thoſe things hoped for to dwell in the ſoul by ſtrong imbracements, ſo that the heart of a man is knitted to them, <hi>Abraham beleeved my day, and rejoyced;</hi> The people of God beleeve, and herein their hearts do all burn within them: It's like the burning-glaſſe, which by its beams ſets the prepared object on fire: pray therefore to love the goodneſſe of it, as aſſent to the truth of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>There is a defect in the efficacy and power of it;</hi> True lively faith will <note place="margin">3.</note> like fire devour all droſſe, whereas we ſee the hiſtoricall believer cannot ſubdue ſin. The Jews though they did believe on Chriſt, yet they for fear dared not to confeſs him, becauſe they loved the praiſe of men more then the glory of God; They belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him to be Chriſt, but would not be afflicted or perſecuted for his ſake; ſo <hi>John 2. 23. Many beleeved,</hi> but Jeſus would not commit himſelf to them, for he knew what was in man; but lively faith would make a man like <hi>Paul,</hi> triumph over all difficulties, becauſe they look upon the things that are not ſeen: If faith bring Chriſt, the fountain of grace into a mans ſoul, that mans life can be no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly wicked, then if a man could carry the ſunne in his hand he could walk in darkneſſe. As therefore the people ſtood looking upon <hi>John</hi> as if he were the Meſſias, and <hi>John</hi> denyed himſelf to be the Meſſias, ſaying, there is one more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then I, <hi>whoſe ſhoe-latchet I am not worthy to unloſe,</hi> ſo do thou ſay, Though there
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:30767:100"/>
are theſe acts of faith, to know, to aſſent to Gods truths; yet there are ſuch fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther noble acts, as that theſe deſerve not the name of faith comparatively, ſuch are, to purifie the heart, to juſtifie, to ſanctifie, to keep from all ſin, and to bring Chriſt to dwell in our hearts.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>It is defective in its Concomitants;</hi> This Hiſtoricall faith is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily conjoyned with other graces, whereas a true and lively faith can no more be <note place="margin">4.</note> ſeparated from other graces, then light and heat can be divided in the Sun-beams, for true faith is that branch which ſucks of the Olive fatneſſe, it uniteth us as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to Chriſt, and when we are ſo, it's impoſſible but that power and life ſhould be communicated to us; Hence all thoſe eminent acts of holineſſe ſpoken of <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. are given to faith, and <hi>Gol</hi> 5. faith is ſaid to work by love; but <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> had HIſtoricall faith, and it was alone, there were no graces to accompany it. Hence we diſtinguiſh between faith alone in the ſubject, and faith alone in the act of Juſtification. The hand alone receiveth that which is offered to it, but the hand could not do this if it were alone, ſeparated from other parts. Hence it is that Believers and Saints are uſed promiſenouſly one for another, becauſe true live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Believers can no more be without holineſſe, then the Sun dark, or the fire cold: Yet for all this, This hiſtoricall faith is a true faith, and it's the gift of God, even as other common gifts of Gods Spirit are: As copper is a true mettall though it be not gold. By this means it cometh about that a lively faith is proper to the Elect only. Hence it's called <hi>the faith of the Elect;</hi> and <hi>as many beleeved as were ordained to eternall life.</hi> Oh therefore conſider your ſelves, you who boaſt of your faith, you who glory in this, that you change not your faith as others do, make diligent ſearch whether it be not a <hi>Simon Magus</hi> his faith that leaveth thee ſtill in a ſtate of gall and bitterneſſe, I am (thou ſaiſt) for the doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and art thou alſo for the life required in Gods Word?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>The deficiency of it is ſeen comparatively,</hi> with other graces; If a man make a beaſt of ſuch a grace in his heart, and demonſtrate no reall effects <note place="margin">5.</note> thereof, is it not hypocriſie and deluſion? The Apoſtle maketh a parallell in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which gives good words, fair promiſes, but exhibits no reall comfort: Even ſuch a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ular beleever is a man that aſſenteth to the true doctrine of Chriſt, but neglecteth reall godlineſſe: faith is called the acknowledging of the truth after god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe; when a mans heart comes to be heated with burning love, as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned with ſhining light, this is of ſure conſequence. All the graces of God have their reall effects, they are not barely notionall, but as fire doth really burn, gall doth really imbitter, ſo doth grace produce its ſenſible, and powerfull effects, <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy works,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: Shew thou beleeveſt there is a God by fearing of him, by obeying of him: Shew thou beleeveſt a day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by preparing to give an account at that time. All grace is for operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as its perfection, therefore the commands of God are for the acts, not the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, and we may as well carry fire in our boſomes, and not feel it burn us, as carry true lively faith, and it not cleanſe our life.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>Hiſtoricall faith if not growing into a ſaving, lively way, is but a kinde of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie</hi> and mocking of God; for to profeſſe that we beleeve him to be omniſcient, <note place="margin">6.</note> omnipotent, that all thoſe terrible threatnings belong to us, and yet we live in thoſe ſinnes that will bring thoſe judgements; what is this but to delude God as much as lyeth in us? But be not deceived, God is not mocked: nay we delude, and mock our own ſouls; for ſo ſaith <hi>James, If any man ſeem to be religious, and bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles not his tongue, he doth</hi>

Conſider this, you who are apt to judge the people of God that endeavour faithfully to ſecure him, though ſubject to many infirmities, hypocrites and deceitfull perſons; know you are the
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:30767:100"/>
groſſeſt and moſt notorious hypocrites that ever were; You profeſſe you beleeve in God, you love him; you proclaim to the world, that you think there is an hell and heaven, but is not thy life a flat contradiction of all this? only to all this which hath been ſaid, we muſt adde this caution, that while we make hiſtoricall faith thus ſeparated from a godly life, poſſible in many men, and that it is in effect a dead faith, becauſe it's not available for thoſe neceſſary priviledges of juſtification and ſalvation: yet we lay not any ground for that popiſh diſtinction of a faith <hi>informis</hi> and <hi>formata:</hi> an informed faith they call a belief of the truths of religion, without any love to them, or of God: a formed faith they call that which is inabled by love, and animated by that to do that which is holy. Thus they make faith of it ſelf a meer ſpeculative apprehenſion, which is to be moulded into obedience only by love. But this is falſe, for it's true and lively faith that puts us upon loving and doing all for God, therefore called faith that works by love, and <hi>I beleeved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I spake.</hi> Thus <hi>Heb. 11. By faith Noah, Abraham, and all thoſe eminent Saints and thoſe glorious acts of holineſſe.</hi> Therefore faith is rather a form aſſiſtant of love and other graces, then they of it: Hiſtoricall faith when it's formed into obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, is thereunto inabled not by love but by juſtifying faith.</p>
                  <p>Uſe of inſtruction concerning the neceſſity of diſcovering this falſe ſign. There <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> is nothing more common then to build all our hopes upon this, that we are for the truth. That as the Jews boaſted, the law was given to them, and not to other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: and therefore thought, though they lived in all wickedneſſe, that would ſave them; thus do Chriſtians about Chriſtianity: Oh, they beleeve as well as any; They will live and die good Proteſtants, not attending to what iniquity may be ſeen in their lives: but what are thy oaths, thy luſts, thy oppoſings of godlineſſe? are theſe ſigns of a good proteſtant alſo? There was one <hi>Eunomius</hi> a wretched he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retique in the Church, and he taught, that whoſoever would be of his ſect, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple unto him, his very faith would be enough to ſave, though he ſhould commit the moſt flagitious crimes that ever were; and do not we thus about the true reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion? The Antinomian he makes that a dead and dangerous faith, when we doe not beleeve that God ſeeth no ſinne in us, and that we are as perfectly righteous as Chriſt, and therefore chargeth all the godly Miniſtery and people of <hi>England</hi> with no more then a dead faith: but we ſee that is a dead faith in Scripture ſenſe, which doth not inable to all mortification, and godlineſſe: Therefore the Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian faith is a dead faith in the Apoſtles argument: Well then, let none run to this altar, He is a good Proteſtant, if ungodly in life, for it will fall out to him as to <hi>Joab,</hi> though at the horns of the Altar, he will be dragged away, and adjudged to eternall death. Many complain the Creed is baniſhed out of the Church, and they conſider not they have long agone baniſhed it out of their lives; for what doth not thy prophaneſſe, thy impiety, ſay there is no God, there is no reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there is no day of judgement? <hi>How can ye beleeve</hi> (ſaid Chriſt) <hi>when ye ſeek the glory of one another;</hi> Alas that ſeemeth a ſmall matter, how can ye beleeve, when you oppoſe and ſcoff at godlineſſe, prophane Gods Sabbaths, neglect all Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily duties? Conſider you are not only called out of Popery to have a better reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but out of the world to live better lives.</p>

                  <p>IN this chapter we may obſerve ſeveral ſharp skirmiſhes between Chriſt and the Phariſees: but as Satan in his conflict was overcome by him, ſo are his children in theſe hot diſputes. The Phariſees in the latter end of this Chapter, charge two things eſpecially upon him to make his doctrine odious, the one is, <hi>The he had a Divel,</hi> and ſo all his Doctrine and Miracles to come by Satanical impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures: the other, <hi>That he did all out of vain glory, to have a multitude of Diſciples,</hi> and to be admired by them: Our Saviour is both defenſive in this cauſe, vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting himſelf from thoſe horrid aſperſions; and offenſive, retorting the ſame things upon them, <hi>That they were of their Father the Divel,</hi> becauſe he was <hi>a man ſlayer, and abode not in the truth:</hi> So ſaith he, <hi>You ſeeck to kill me, a man,</hi> that is cruelty, <hi>Who tells you the truth,</hi> that is ingratitude, <hi>Which he heard of God,</hi> that is impiety: and becauſe they gloried in this, <hi>That Abraham was their father,</hi> he ſheweth the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parity between their works, and <hi>Abrahams</hi> works: becauſe alſo they ſaid, <hi>God was their Father,</hi> he driveth them alſo out of this refuge; for if they were of God, they would hear and know his Word; Children do preſently diſcern their Fathers voice. To that accuſation of vain glory, he anſwereth in my text, by ſhewing the <hi>vanity of all humane glory:</hi> if I ſhould look at this, I ſhould but catch at a ſhadow, open my mouth to ſwallow air: it is nothing. Now if Chriſt did judge all the glory which he ſhould hear by his Doctrine and miracles, nothing; how ſhould this make Miniſters afraid, who affect honour for ſome new notions, excellent Sermons, and parts? Chriſt did not glorifie himſelf, why ſhould we then? Yet leaſt they ſhould think him without glory, he tels them, <hi>There is one that honoureth him,</hi> viz. <hi>God the Father,</hi> by immediate teſtimony from heaven, and by many miraculous o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations: and to humble them the more, he ſaith, <hi>This that honoureth me thus, is he of whom you ſay, he is your Father,</hi> of whom you make your boaſt and braggs, that he is yours. I ſhall ſtand onely upon this paſſage, intending to ſhew that a people may have great confidence, and a bold perſwaſion of heart that God is their God, and yet they be of their <hi>Father the Divel.</hi> For whereas the laſt time I told you a man might have an hiſtorical, or dogmatical faith in matters of religion, and yet be deſtitute of Gods Spirit in a ſaving manner: now I ſhall ſhew you, he may have ſome fiducial application of Gods favour, and confidently repoſe himſelf in the boſom or arms of Chriſt, and yet Chriſt ſay to ſuch, <hi>Depart, I know you not.</hi> A ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſubject to be handled, becauſe moſt people who have no true claim or inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in God, yet it is ſtrange to conſider what quietneſs, and peace, and boldneſs

they have in their hearts, when indeed fear ſhould compaſs them round about.</p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>Every peaceable frame of heart, and confident perſwaſion of Gods love, is not aſure teſtimony that ſuch an one is in the ſtate of Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7. <hi>Sheweth he was alive without the Law,</hi> That is, he had great qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs and eaſe of mind; he thought himſelf in a ſure and ſafe way: but alas, this was his ignorance, his blindneſs. Even as a man in a dungeon may think himſelf ſafe, when there are Serpents and poyſonous creatures round about him, onely he doth not ſee them: or as a man in a Lethargy feels no pain, though he be near the gates of death: Such is the condition of many perſons, they thank God they have no trouble, their ſoul is at much eaſe and quietneſs, they doubt not of Gods fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and love to them: hence in the midſt of their afflictions they will ſay, <hi>I thank my good God,</hi> when (alas) we may ſay of ſuch, as Chriſt of the <hi>Jews, You ſay he is your Father, but you have not known him;</hi> ſo they know nothing powerfully and practically about God.</p>
                  <p>To open this, Let us conſider what is the nature of this ſecure quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. <note place="margin">The nature of this falſe peace. 1. Free from ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>It is accompanied with a great deal of eaſe and peace in a mans heart, ſo that their conſciences have no terrour, no tremblings, but all is well within them.</hi> Now that wicked men may be in ſuch a condition, is plain by that where they ſay, <hi>Peace, peace, then ſhall come ſudden deſtruction:</hi> and the Pſalmiſt doth with ſome kinde of emulation, deſcribe the joyful quiet condition of many wicked men. They have no bonds in their death: They ſeem to live more cheerfully, and dye more quietly then Godly men: ſo then, all peace and quietneſs in thy conſcience, is not preſently a good teſtimony; for this ſecurity may ariſe from blindneſs, from ſelf-love, from a ſenſeleſs cauterized heart, as is to be ſhewed: So that this frame of Spirit is ſo far from being boaſted of, that it is indeed the wofulleſt and ſaddeſt calamity that can be; better to be ſo many <hi>Cains,</hi> fearing every thing will damn a man, then to be one of <hi>Lachiſh,</hi> ſitting at eaſe, and fearing nothing. It is true, the Prophet ſaith, <hi>There is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked:</hi> and is therefore compared to the ſea, alwaies foaming and diſquieted: So that by this place, we would think it were not poſſible for a man to be a wicked man, and have any peace, but the Scripture ſpeaks there of a true and right peace, ſuch as when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Being justified by faith, we have peace with God:</hi> Inſomuch that the wicked mans quietneſs doth not deſerve the name of Peace. There is onely a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance of wrath: and it is becauſe his heart is rotten, that it feeleth no pain; even as the member of a mans body rotten, is not ſenſible of any torment. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaks of ſome, who had cauterized conſciences, <hi>Seared with an hot Iron, or cut off,</hi> as ſome expound it: and of others who were paſt feeling. They were ſo brawny and cruſted over, they had no ſenſe of any pain: Alas this cannot be called peace. Take heed therefore leſt that ſecurity and quietneſs in thy heart, come not from a mere rotten, ſenſeleſs, ſtupidity in thee. Certainly this truth doth much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us; do not think to put off God as <hi>Jacob</hi> did <hi>Iſaak;</hi> do not think to ſteal a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and heaven from God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>As there is nothing but quietneſs within, ſo there are bold and confident perſwaſions about God, and his love towards them.</hi> Now a mans condition cannot be <note place="margin">2. They are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of God, love.</note> more deſperate then when he is deluded with a reſolute perſwaſion that God loveth him; even as ſome mad men have been perſwaded that they were great Kings and Emperors, and had ſuch great Kingdomes, when at the ſame time they were under cruel hardſhip. Oh ſuch a madneſs is upon moſt men, that do not, with the Divel, look upon all the Glory of the world, and ſay falſly, <hi>all that is his,</hi> but upon all the Glory of heaven, and ſay preſumptuouſly, <hi>all that is his:</hi> This was the Phariſees impudencie, who were confidently perſwaded that God was their Father, that he he loved them, when they were the miſerable wretched Impps of Satan! This al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was the grand cauſe of all thoſe expoſtalations the Prophets had with the <hi>Jews;</hi>
                     <pb n="176" facs="tcp:30767:102"/>
they truſted in Gods love, though they did lye, ſteal, ſwear, yet they would come into his Temple, and call upon him, which the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> with much hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly zeal expoſtulates with them for. Oh, this groſs impudencie is too viſible in our daies: have you not many prophane ſinners? many lyars, curſers, oppoſers of what is good? Yet they will come here, and ſay, <hi>Our Father:</hi> nay, you cannot meet with any beaſtly ſinner, but his heart is filled with this bold impudencie, to think and hope that God is his Father; So that we may cry out, Oh that God would touch theſe mountains, that they might melt before him, Oh that God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom the very earth did tremble and quake, would alſo make ſuch mens hearts afraid before him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Where ſuch bold apprehenſions are concerning God, there is not only confidence in the general, that God is merciful, but they have alſo a fiducial application, &amp; appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. They may have fiducial applications.</note> 
                     <hi>of God to their own ſelves in particular:</hi> And herein they have a great reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of juſtifying faith, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Who loved me, and gave himſelf for me:</hi> ſo theſe will apply Chriſt to their particular: I thank my Chriſt, my Redeemer, my Saviour. In the Godly ſuch applications are of ſaith in the moſt excellent manner, in the wicked it is of meer preſumption, without any true ground at all. It is indeed the glorious fruit of the covenant of Grace, that thereby God becomes the God of his children, <hi>Hoſea 2. They ſhall call me Iſhi, and no more Baali,</hi> that is, <hi>My Husband, not my Lord:</hi> they ſhall have more dear and appropriated meditations of God; and at the end of the Chapter, <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> Hence <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> 4. 3, 4. God would have the Church repenting, ſay, <hi>My Father.</hi> Fiducial applications of Gods love to us are a duty, as the learned prove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Papiſts: Hence faith is called, <hi>Eating and drinking of Chriſt.</hi> When a true broken heart loaded with ſin, cryeth out with <hi>Thomas, My God, my Lord,</hi> this is not carnal preſumption, but holy believing. But now when men whoſe hearts were never ſmitten with Gods diſpleaſure for ſin, find no burthen of it, and ſo cry not for eaſe to Chriſt; when (I ſay) ſuch ſay, <hi>I thank my God, and my Redeemer,</hi> this is bold preſumption in them. God is not the God of the dead, we may ſay, but of the living; he is not the God, the Father of ſuch who live in, and love their wickedneſs. It would be a diſhonour to be a Father of ſuch Children: but he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viteth thoſe to call him Father, and my Father, who are deeply humbled for ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his hand, who are of ſelf-emptyed and poor ſpirits, acknowldeging his Grace onely. As therefore we are not to diſcourage the wounded heart, but to imbolden him to appropriat Chriſt to himſelf in particular, and that he is to ſet againſt all ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile fears and doubts that would like the Divels to the poſſeſſed man, keep him alwaies about the tombes, and make him gaſh and wound himſelf; ſo we are alſo to ſet a flaming ſword, as God did to <hi>Adam,</hi> to a prophane man, leſt he venture to come into this Paradiſe. Oh then he adviſed and conſider, whether it be faith or preſumption makes thee ſay, <hi>My God, my Redeemer.</hi> A <hi>Paul</hi> may ſay ſo, and a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee may ſay ſo.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Where this boldneſſe is, there is a ſhifting and putting off all thoſe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations that may bring us to make any doubt, or any queſtion about our ſelves:</hi> and <note place="margin">4.</note> truely that is a real demonſtration; thy peace, thy comfort is not right, thou art ſo unwilling to be brought to light: the thief hateth the light ſaith our Saviour: now obſerve it, many of thoſe perſons who have ſuch bold perſwaſions of Gods love, they cannot abide to hear terrible Sermons, they love not to hear of hell, and the day of judgement: they cannot endure to hear of the differences of Gods work upon mens hearts, and how far hypocrites and reprobates may go: Oh theſe things cut them, and make them mad; and why is all this? but becauſe the peace and comfort they have, is a falſe and unſound one, which will abide no touchſtone, cannot endure any ſhaking or moving at all. What was the cauſe that the Phariſees were ſo immoveably perſwaded of Gods love towards them? did hate and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Chriſt even to death? It was onely becauſe he manifeſted their godlineſſe was not true godlineſſe, their comforts were not true comforts, their peace was not

true peace, and thus woful ſelf-flattery was their ruin. God ſeeing ſuch a pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Oh it is terrible when God curſeth thee, the Law curſeth thee, the Miniſters of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his curſes againſt thee, yet thou to bleſs thy ſelf, and to ſay, <hi>God loveth thee, and will do good to thee:</hi> Oh take heed of theſe curſed ſhiftings: this untempered morter will not hold out, though thou daub it up never ſo craftily: do not ev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Where this quietneſs is, there is much boaſting and glorying in this, that they have a good heart, and ſo rely much upon this.</hi> It is a wonder to hear men that <note place="margin">5. He is much in glorying of his good heart.</note> live in a conſtant neglect of holy duties, yea ſometimes wallow in the filth and mire of laothſom ſins, yet how they will boaſt in this, <hi>They have a good heart,</hi> and that as good as any of the ſtricteſt profeſſors have: What wilde Logick is this? How can there be a good heart, if there be not a good life? How can there be a good tree, if there be not good fruit? Is that a good fire that burneth not, that warmeth not? Is that good meat that nouriſheth not? Oh, why do not ſuch conſider that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Aphoriſm of the wiſe man, <hi>He that truſteth in his own heart, is a fool?</hi> Oh take heed that all thy boaſtings of thy heart being good, whatſoever thy failings be, are not meere folly. It is folly to truſt in a mans heart, becauſe it is ſo deceitful: He thinketh he doth repent, when he doth not: he thinketh he loveth God, when he doth not. Doſt thou therefore appeal to thy heart, and call thy heart to witneſs for thy godlineſſe? Oh, that is the very cheat and couſener in the world: It is deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all things ſaith the Prophet, <hi>who can know it?</hi> Do not thou reſt on that which is naturally full of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>es, and hypocriſies: It is true, when the heart is enlightened by Gods ſpirit, as in the godly, then it is made a true heart, and a faithful heart though not perfectly: and ſo thoſe graces in us, which of themſelves would never evidence themſelves, by Gods Spirit become viſible; even as ſome relate of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtone, which will not caſt any glorious luſtre unleſſe the ſun-beams ſhine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>This carnal preſumption and boldneſſe may hold in the midſt of Gods cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities and wrath, yea at the ſtroaks of death it ſelf.</hi> The people of Iſrael, though <note place="margin">6. This falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence may continue in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity and death it ſelf.</note> ſmitten by God for their abominations which were evident, yet ſaith the Prophet <hi>Micah,</hi> would come and lean upon God: they were either actually under Gods judgements, or under the terrible denunciation of them by the Prophet: yet they would lean upon God, as if he were their God, and that ſuch ſecure confidence may hold to death, appeareth by the fooliſh Virgins, who found no lack of oyl till it was too late: And we ſee thoſe condemned perſons at the day of judgement, pleading for themſelves, with a wonder why they ſhould be condemned, for they neglected no duty required of them: <hi>When ſaw we thee ſick, and viſited thee not?</hi> So that it is no ſure ſign, though a man even at deaths door abateth not his confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God for all that. The Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>they have no ſuch bonds in their death,</hi> or pain and fear as ſometimes other men may have: a godly man may dye doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a wicked man preſuming: It is not then the ſaying, and the profeſſing they have a great deal of peace in God, but the grounds why, and the motives, they muſt be ſearched into. Therefore though we blame Papiſts for teaching to doubt, and making a doubt a duty, yet we preſſe for an holy ſearch, and a godly fear and trembling in the trying of our hearts, leſt we be deceived.</p>
                  <p>In the next place let us conſider, why ſuch bold confidence is not to be relyed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <note place="margin">Why ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence is not: to be relied up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. 1.</note> And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe it comes not from a true and genuine ground, which is the ſpirit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption, the comforter, the ſeal,</hi> who onely quieteth the heart in a gracious ſure way, but it cometh from carnal ſelf-love, and ſelf flattery: we are in love with our
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:30767:103"/>
ſelves, and we think God loves what we love. Thus the Pſalmiſt notably to the ſecure wicked man, <hi>Thou thoughteſt I was ſuch an one as thy ſelf:</hi> as the <hi>Roman</hi> painter being in love with a woman, painted every goddeſs like the woman he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; ſo doth every man ſet up ſuch a God in his thoughts and affections, which he would have, and is moſt like himſelf: and by this means, becauſe he ſaith, <hi>all is well,</hi> he judgeth all good within him, therefore he ſuppoſeth God doth ſo alſo. Oh then know, that ſelf-love and the Spirit of Adoption, differ more then heaven and hell. Indeed if thy aſſurance, if thy boldneſſe come in the Spirits way, it were a comforting by <hi>it,</hi> a rejoycing by <hi>it,</hi> then thou mighteſt rejoyce and be glad in God: But when it cometh from thy muddy and filthy heart, all this will waſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. It is God that juſtifieth, and it is God that condemneth; it matters not though a thouſand hearts juſtifie us, if God do not. If a malefactor be condemned, and hath a pardon from inferior magiſtrates, he judgeth that nothing, unleſs the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Magiſtrate abſolve him. Oh, therefore judge thy ſelf: think, it may be for all my good thoughts God ſaith otherwiſe: I bleſſe it may be, but God curſeth it may be; and know, it cannot come from any thing but carnal love, if thou haſt this boldneſſe, and yet liveſt in groſſe ſins unrepented of, and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It is becauſe Satan doth not frown upon, trouble and moleſt them.</hi> Now that cannot be called a good quietneſſe, or a good peace which is ſo onely becauſe <note place="margin">2.</note> the Divel looks upon them as his own, and ſo will no wiſe diſturb them: our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our doth abundantly confirm this, when he ſaith, <hi>That as long as the ſtrong man keepeth the houſe, all things are at quiet:</hi> Thus thoſe that are under Satans Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, they have jollity, ſecurity, hardneſſe of heart, that ſo they may not be ſenſible of their miſery, and thereby ſeek an eſcape out of his ſnares. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> then uſed the Iſraelites moſt cruelly, when they began to be weary of their bondage, and to ſeek comfort ſomewhere elſe; ſo that thou haſt little cauſe to be glad of this thy peace, for it is a peace thou art beholding to the Divel for; it is he that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens thy heart; it is he that makes thee deſperate; that hath put out thy right eye that thou canſt not behold the enemy that lyeth in wait againſt thee: Therefore do thou no more be ſecure in this quietneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>This bold confidence doth not ariſe from a good motive:</hi> It cometh from general apprehenſions of Gods goodneſſe and mercy, ſuch as heathens have. They <note place="margin">3.</note> conceive of God in general, as one who is altogether merciful: they think he that made them, will ſave them: whereas divels might thus argue for hope, becauſe God made them, yet he will not ſave them. What a miſerable ſupport is it to have no more ground for thy ſalvation, then the damned ſpirits in hell have? But a true gracious confidence is from the Covenant of Grace in Chriſt; it hath reſpect not to the nature of God abſolutely conſidered, but relatively, as in Chriſt reconciled with us. Hence the promiſe of God is mutual, <hi>I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people:</hi> Do not thou think that any natural apprehenſion about God can give the leaſt hope, know this muſt come wholly by revelation: ſet the word of God aſide, which doth reveal Gods good pleaſure to believers, and the way of pardon and ſalvation is no more poſſible then that of the Divels: ſo then the godly mans confidence is from Scripture revelation and direction, whereas the preſumptuous mans is from natural ſuggeſtion.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>This confidence is defective, becauſe it doth ſeparate and divide thoſe things which God hath inſeparably joyned together, and that is the means and the end.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> The preſumptuous mans confidence is maintained and kept up, though he go not in the right way, yea, though he walk in a contrary way: as thoſe wicked men who though they defiled themſelves with abominations, ſaid, <hi>No evil ſhall come nigh us:</hi> and ſuch as had made a Covenant with Hell and death: but the godly mans faith, it cleanſeth the heart; and he that hath this hope, <hi>purifieth himſelf even as God is pure.</hi> How unſufferable is it to ſee a man confident of Gods love, and yet walk continually in the wayes he hateth!

The mercies God vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to them are aggravated by an enumeration of the ſeverall wonders God had wrought for them, as alſo by a lively deſcription of that Land and Countrey they were now made Lords of, <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. 7, 8, 9. called therefore the good land frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and is made a type of heaven, for the joyfull pleaſure of it, as if the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> now poſſeſſed of <hi>Canaan</hi> were brought into Paradiſe again; and for the full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of it the Scriptures expreſſion is remarkable. <hi>Deut. 11. 12. A Land which the Lord thy God careth for, The eyes of the Lord thy God are alwaies upon it, from the beginning of the year to the end of it:</hi> a phraſe much like that which the Scripture uſeth even of his own children, as if he had the ſame care of that Land as of his own people. As he thus lively deſcribes their mercies, ſo he doth as powerfully quicken them up unto their duty, which is to take heed of all thoſe ſins, that fullneſſe, eaſe, and ſecurity, would quickly breed; whereof he inſtanceth in one more eſpecially, <hi>viz.</hi> an apprehenſion that God had done this to them, for their righteouſneſſe, becauſe they were more holy then others, as they thought; Therefore they concluded themſelves more happy. Becauſe their land abounded with all excellent fruit, they judged their lives to overflow with all graces. They
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:30767:104"/>
took all this proſperity as a reward of their piety. Now <hi>Moſes</hi> removeth thoſe foundations they built upon, inſtructing them that this mercy befell them, not becauſe they were ſo good, but their enemies ſo bad.</p>
                  <p>So that in the Text you have the ſin forbidden, a falſe conceit of their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and uprightneſſe, amplified with their confidence therein; <hi>Speak not in thy heart,</hi> &amp;c. The ſoul can talk to it ſelf, and though man cannot hear what it ſpeaks, God doth. Thus <hi>John</hi> to the Phariſees, <hi>Say not in your hearts;</hi> and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation in a good ſenſe is, to commune with our own hearts; This phraſe doth excellently imply, what diſcourſes and apprehenſions men are ready to frame to themſelves, and although theſe lie in the breaſt, and cannot be diſcovered by men, yet God takes notice of them to puniſh them. When <hi>Moſes</hi> excludes righteouſnes and uprightneſſe of heart, by the former he meaneth all outward actions of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe, and by the latter all inward intentions and purpoſes of heart, though they fail ſometimes externally; Now as <hi>Canaan</hi> was a type of heaven, ſo as the introduction of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> thereunto was only of Gods grace, ſo is our poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of heaven. This their groundleſſe apprehenſion to make outward bleſſings a ſign of their righteouſneſſe, <hi>Moſes</hi> confureth, by attributing this to other cauſes, as firſt, the impiety and wickedneſſe of their adverſaries; as for their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe it moved not God, but the horrid tranſgreſſions of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him: The iniquity of the <hi>Amorites</hi> was now full, not the righteouſneſſe of the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> Another cauſe was Gods Oath and promiſe, which he made to their fathers, whereby though he was not a debtor to their righteouſneſſe, yet he was obliged to his own truth and fidelity: Hence <hi>Deut.</hi> 7. 7. The originall of all the bleſſings vouchſafed to them, is reduced to Gods love meerly, not any excellency in them. Now that this ſinfull perſwaſion might not abide in them, ſee how the Scripture followeth it over and over again in theſe three verſes: Speak not that it is for thy righteouſneſſe, <hi>&amp;c. ver.</hi> 4. Not for your uprightneſſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. Underſtand therefore that it is not for thy righteouſneſſe, <hi>v.</hi> 6.</p>

They think it impoſſible that ſeeing God hath ſo bleſſed them here, he ſhould damn them hereafter. This falſe ſign doth not belong to every one, but to thoſe who have abundance of outward mercies, eſpecially if brought to partake them from a low and indigent condition. The more their change is admirable, the more teſtimony they think of Gods goodneſſe to them, and their own inherent goodneſſe. For the diſcovery of the weakneſſe of this prop, take notice firſt of theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That proſperity, wealth and ſucceſſe, they are in themſelves bleſſings, mercies, and ſo good things to be deſired. Hence the Scripture doth ſo often uſe <note place="margin">1. Wealth and proſperity, good things to be deſired.</note> them as incouragements and incentives to holineſſe, If you obſerve theſe, you ſhall be bleſſed at home and abroad, ſee <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. and leſt we ſhould think, that outward wealth and proſperity were only to be regarded in the Old Teſtament, becauſe they had not ſuch a meaſure of Gods Spirit, we ſee what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the new, It is more bleſſed to give then receive, and he ſpeaketh of it as a ſpeech that the Lord Jeſus was wont to uſe, though the Evangeliſts do not record it: ſo that outward mercies are in themſelves bleſſings, and the want of them by the Scripture is made a miſery and affliction: <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> made the outward affluence of wealth neceſſary to that Beatitude he ſpeaketh of, but Chriſt his diſcipline is otherwiſe. Hereupon our Saviour when he ſpeaks of ſeverall bleſſedneſſes to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall graces, with ſpirituall happineſſe he reckoneth temporall, <hi>Bleſſed are the meek for they ſhall inherit the earth.</hi> Hence we reade of the people of God praying for theſe earthly mercies, and we have a direction for it in the Lords Praier, when we pray for daily bread, which although ſome learned men underſtand of heavenly bread, and tranſlate it ſuperſubſtantiall, yet that hath no probability. It is true indeed the very petition doth much limit and moderate our deſires, for it is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:30767:105"/>
the great things that belong to Gods glory; and it is but one Petition, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there are divers for ſpirituall things, ſo that our Saviour would have us to be about theſe earthly things, as thoſe fowls of the heaven are, which on a ſudden fall on the ground for their food, but preſently fly up to heaven again: and then, it's daily food, or as the moſt learned expound it, food convenient, and decent for our place and calling, not ſuperſluity. Thus though theſe cutward mercies are bleſſings, yet we are to circumciſe our affections about them; l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Although theſe are bleſſings and mercies, and ſo good things; yet</hi>

Hence though they come to the godly from the grace of God, yet the Scripture never cals them grace, as it doth the fruits of Gods Spirit; ſo that this may abundantly comfort thoſe that are poor in the world, yet rich in grace. Thou haſt the beſt good that is in all Gods Treaſure, in making the godly, he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed a greater bleſſing upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

argument, and it hath no ſtrength, but with carnall hearts that account nothing great and good, but what is earthly. <hi>Paul</hi> was diſcovered a faithfull Apoſtle by his iron chains on his legs, not his golden ones about his neck. By this doctrine we may ſee how imbred a thing it is in a man to be high minded, and ſecure in his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as if God loved him more then others, becauſe he hath beſtowed more of theſe earthly bleſſings upon him then others. They think that as God giveth them a higher place here on earth, ſo he will alſo in heaven: Eſpecially this ſin is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by you of the City, many whereof have been bleſſed by a bountifull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe from little or nothing: you ſay with <hi>Jacob, With a ſtaff came I over Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan up to London, and now I am become two bands:</hi> You are above him in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, his five pound gained tenne, yours one peny a thouſand, and do you not take this great providence of God to you as an argument of your righteouſneſſe? Do not you ſpeak in your heart, as the Text ſaith, though not with your mouth, that this makes you have hopes, that God who hath done ſo much for you here, will doe much more for you hereafter? Here is little true comfort in all theſe thoughts, as is to be ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Although we cannot conclude grace by outward mercies, yet thus far <note place="margin">5.</note> we muſt by Scripture ſay, that God out of a generall love in a providentiall way doth give many a man outward proſperity and wealth, for his diligence, induſtry, upright and honeſt dealing in the world. Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>The hand of the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent maketh rich,</hi> and truth and juſtice in our way is bleſſed by God to encreaſe. Thus <hi>Auſtin</hi> attributed all the temporall greatneſſe that the ſtate of <hi>Rome</hi> came to, unto the juſtice of their common-wealth, but this comes only from a generall Love of God, not from that peculiar love which belongs to his people; it doth not come from the ſame fountain that mercy and pardon comes; Therefore it's a fruit of providence, not of election: it argueth upright dealing, but not an heart made pure and upright to God: what then though thou ſaiſt, God hath bleſt my diligence, my honeſt dealing? yet thou canſt not ſay, This is the fruit of my conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and regeneration, being turned unto God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Some go into another extremity, and conclude of their good eſtate and holy condition, becauſe they are in a poor, needy, miſerable eſtate, and deſtitute of all earthly comforts; They reade in the Scripture, that the poor receive the Goſpel, Chriſt invited the lame and blinde, That perſecutions and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are the way to heaven; They hear Chriſt ſaid, Bleſſed are thoſe that mourn and weep, and Wo be to thoſe that laugh; They hear God hath not choſen many rich, many noble, and therefore becauſe they are in great extremities here, they do not think God will make them have an hell here and an hell hereafter. But eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poor man is not a <hi>Lazarus,</hi> nay, there are many times none more wicked, cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, prophane, and enemies to all goodneſſe, then thoſe that are in a low and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable condition; A wofull thing it is indeed to have nothing but miſery here, and nothing but torments hereafter. If thy poverty indeed were ſanctified, thou waſt more holy; humble, heavenly, then that eſtate would not be contemned by God: he doth not diſdain the praier, of the poor, humble and lowly ones; but then be ſure thou art ſuch a poor man as the Scripture ſpeaks of, otherwiſe as thou many times here on earth wanteſt a crum of bread, ſo thou wilt in hell a drop of water.</p>

Thy fat paſtures are only to fat thee the more for hell; Do not bear thy head high, becauſe thou haſt more abundance, wealth, greatneſſe then others.

                  <p>As 1. Outward comforts in the plenty of them are apt to beget pride and lofti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of heart, ſo as to deſpiſe and contemn thoſe that are under them: Hence <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Timothy</hi> charge the rich men of this world, that they be not high min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but fear; charge them as if entreaties and milde perſwaſions would not do them any good, but charge them, and then that they be not high-minded; all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts are apt like ripe fruit to breed ſome worms, eſpecially that of pride and inſolency of heart: Mark therefore whether the bleſſings thou haſt make thee bold, ſecure, lofty. Thou beginneſt to care for no body, to fear nothing: Alas, God hath not done theſe great things to thee out of love to thee, for they have unkindely, and ſinfull influences upon thee.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If theſe outward mercies deadden thy heart to the things of God, or the <note place="margin">2.</note> exerciſe of thoſe means of grace God hath appointed; Oh thou haſt cauſe then to tremble in the encreaſe of them. We ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. that the cares of this world, and ceitfulneſſe of riches, did eat like a Cancer into the heart of thoſe hearers that came neareſt to godlineſſe. They were next to the good, but theſe thorns ſpringing up choak the good ſeed; ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That ſome made ſhipwrack of their faith and conſcience, becauſe of their inordinate love to the world; Divitia a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendo,</hi> ſaith one if they divide the heart between God and them, if they diſtract in praier, in duties, all thy profeſſion of religion, is more withering and languiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſince God hath done thus mercifully to thee; think thou haſt little cauſe to have any confidence from hence; <hi>Demas</hi> he did cleave to this world, ſome think he totally apoſtatized, others that he did wonderfully abate in his former zeal, that he forſook <hi>Paul</hi> in his Pilgrimages and Travels for the Goſpel, and betook him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſome more profitable way: which ſoever it was, we ſee how quickly ſuch worms as theſe may devour the faireſt gourds. Thou therefore that ſaiſt, God hath bleſſed me thus much from nothing, God hath given me a great encreaſe; Tell me true, Hath God bleſſed thee in thy love to God, in the exerciſe of holy duties? doſt thou pray better? are thy family duties more vigorous and zealous? Oh it is an ill ſymptome to grow up more into the world and down more towards hell. Thou bleſſeſt God thou art come from nothing to a great eſtate, and thou trembleſt not to think that thy flouriſhing hopes of grace are now come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Oh therefore take heed how you boaſt your ſelves in that which God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horreth: Hath the encreaſe of mercies been the decreaſe of duties? Is the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of wealth the ebbing of holineſſe? Then thou haſt no cauſe to be confident, but rather to fear and tremble. Though duties and the means of grace, be wings to elevate thee to heaven, yet if theſe outward bleſſings are a clog or mill-ſtone about the neck to preſſe thee down, the latter will quickly juſtle out the former.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Then can outward abundance be no comfortable ſign, when the means to <note place="margin">3.</note> get it and the way to preſerve it are unlawfull, and ſuch as the Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth:
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:30767:107"/>
The Lord many times ſuffereth unjuſt and deceitfull men to thrive for a while in the world, and ſo ungodly men have much outward proſperity. even Idolaters, when Gods own Church hath been much afflicted: <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> expoſtulated with God about this, no wonder wicked men thought the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of themſelves, when <hi>David</hi> a godly man was ſo diſcontented hereat, that he thought all his integrity and pure worſhip of God was in vain: Yea the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens they have buſied themſelves, <hi>Plutarch</hi> and <hi>Seneca</hi> have on purpoſe deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this providence of God, Why it is many times ſo ill with the godly, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſo well with the wicked: but till <hi>David</hi> went into Gods Sanctuary, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood Gods word, he was not ſatisfied, but by that perceived they were in ſlippery places, and he began to think he would not have all their proſperity, with the ſad conſequents of it; and indeed it is never well with the wicked, though in abundance, and never ill with the godly, though in deep extremities: ſay ye to the righteous, <hi>it ſhall be well with him.</hi> ſay ye to the wicked, it ſhall be ill with him, ſay it, Gods Miniſters are boldly and peremptorily to pronounce this; that morſel which went down at firſt as ſweet honey, will at laſt be emptied like gravel out of the belly. Do not therefore conclude of thy great mercies, it may be the manner and way may afford thee little comfort, it may be that which thou think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt a demonſtration of Gods love to thee, is an argument of thy wickedneſs; when men come to great eſtate, preſently we ask, How is it raiſed? as the Geographers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute about the ſpring of <hi>Nilus:</hi> Outward mercies in Gods way are ſweet and comfortable, but in unwarrantable and unlawful waies, they melt like wax before the fire, and beſides they ſting like a Scorpion, and bite like an Adder.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Therefore may we not truſt in outward proſperity, becauſe God <note place="margin">3.</note> many times giveth a man all the good things he ſhall have in this life only; and afterwards there is nothing but everlaſting woe and miſery. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered <hi>Dives</hi> in hell, <hi>Remember thou receivedſt good things in thy life time.</hi> Now this is an heavy doom if men did rightly conſider it. Thou haſt much abundance, much eaſe, thou thriveſt and groweſt fat in the world, thou eateſt and drinkeſt, and makeſt merry. Oh fear leſt God give thee all thy good things in this life only! What a wonderfull change was made with <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus;</hi> the one having only good in this life meeteth with only evil, not a drop of water to cool his tongue; the other having nothing but evil, meeteth with that which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together happy. You may read in <hi>Judges</hi> about <hi>Gid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Thus <hi>Dives</hi> in this life, <hi>Soul, take thy eaſe, for thou haſt much good laid up for thee;</hi> in the other life, Soul tremble and plunge thy ſelf in horrour, for thou haſt much torment and wrath treaſured up for thee, all is changed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Therefore may we not truſt in theſe, becauſe we many times abuſe <note place="margin">4.</note> them to a contrary end for which God gave them; he gave them to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of much glory to God, and good to others. If God give thee honours, dignities, ſucceſſe, wealth, thou art to be glad of them no further then they may make thee ſerviceable to God; Thou doſt not look at thy own eaſe, thy own profit by them, but only attend unto the ſerviceableneſſe thou maieſt be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of thereby: But oh how rare is this! Rich men are the greateſt men in debt of all others; they are much to God, much to the publick, much to others neceſſities; now what comfort canſt thou take if God bleſſe thee with theſe things, if thou doſt not alſo finde him making thee thereby inſtrumental to his glory? If thou keepeſt all the good mercies God vouchſafeth to thee, as the Ants and Piſmires do their grain and corn which they hide in their little hils, and as they ſay, bite it that it may not grow.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, They are not to be relied on, becauſe though all power to get wealth <note place="margin">5.</note> and proſper in the world, argue God is with thee, yet he may be only with thee providentially and powerfully, not graciouſly; As when <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered and prevailed; when <hi>Alexander</hi> became great, <hi>Auguſtus</hi> happy. God
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:30767:108"/>
was with theſe in a mighty providential way, but not graciouſly. It is an opinion that God vouchſafeth to ſome men an <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> a good ſucceſſe, ſo that they proſper in all their enterprizes. Again, others though as prudent, as pious, yet never have good ſucceſſe. <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> was perſwaded of this, when he ſaid <hi>Caeſarem vehis &amp; fortunam ejus:</hi> and concerning <hi>Alexander</hi> it is obſerved, that his very pictures were ſuccesfull; but <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75. 6. doth well conclude this matter. Well, grant there are ſuch men whom God will preſerre, make rich, great, honoured, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will or no; yet all this argueth God is only with them powerfully, not graciouſly. Now it is no ſolid comfort to perceive Gods power and aſſiſtance with us, unleſſe we alſo finde his gracious preſence.</p>

Of Inſtruction to thoſe who meet with much proſperity and outward encouragements in this world: Take heed of thinking that God doth this to thee, for thy righteouſneſſe, for thy piety. Do not think this is, becauſe God loveth thee more then others: Nay fear leſt theſe mercies prove not like oil in hell flames to make it ſcorch the hotter. O do not let thy heart run out Thus, God hath bleſt me in my trading, in my buying and ſelling, in my enterprizes and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings; but withall conſider how he hath bleſt thee with an heavenly heart, with a gracious life; ſince thou haſt had more wealth haſt thou alſo had more grace? The ſhip in the ſea goeth ſwiftly, till it touch upon the ſands and gravel under it, and then it is ſtopt. Oh take heed that ye be not like <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> ſwallowed up of the earth in a ſpiritual way, as they were in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral.</p>

Let them know they are no arguments of true godlineſſe, or of Gods dear love in Chriſt. If indeed thou hadſt no portion in Chriſt, no intereſt in his grace; If thou hadſt no gracious fruits of his Spirit upon thee; then thou mightſt juſtly cry out, ah me, a wretched and barren wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe near to curſing and burning: but now it is otherwiſe, thou haſt thoſe things that do indeed accompany ſalvation. Beſides, let not thy heart be troubled at the want of theſe things, for they are not the beſt things, nor are they the moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary things, and God hath vouchſafed them to thee: Oh it is a ſign thy heart is too carnal and earthly, that crieth for earth, when God hath given thee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pearls!

whereby. The matter done by them, <hi>is to eſcape the pollutions of the world,</hi> that is, their idolatry and great vices, which formerly they lived in, betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the true profeſſion of Chriſt. The word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Secondly, The means by which, is <hi>through the knowledge of Christ,</hi> ſo that their lives were clean, not by moral precepts, and prudent dictates of nature, but by faith hiſtorical or temporary in Chriſt; now here is the great Queſtion, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther theſe were truly regenerated or no?</hi> Thoſe that hold the Saints Apoſtaſie, ſay the Affirmative, and they preſſe that word in the verſe before <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>for a little time,</hi> or <hi>almost they had eſcaped,</hi> as <hi>Agrippa</hi> was almoſt a Chriſtian, and thus reading it would be no advantage, and ſo we ſee it in the Margin of our Bibles: But I think it dangerous to depart from univerſally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved copies. Others therefore that are Orthodox, ſay indeed, Theſe were regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, but their fall was only partial and temporary, for they did recover again as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter:</hi> but the Text affordeth no help to ſuch an Aſſertion: I ſhall therefore conclude, That although by the Chriſtian Religion there was made a great and wonderfull change in the lives of theſe men, yet they were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly regenerated, and my reaſon is, becauſe the Apoſtle compareth them to a waſhed Swine, which though never ſo white, yet is a Swine ſtill, her nature is not altered, therefore ſhe will return to her mire again; So theſe though purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their lives by the profeſſion of the Goſpel, yet were indeed in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral condition; and therefore when temptations came, they returned to their own natures, therefore <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. are called <hi>unſtable ſouls.</hi> But you will ſay, If they were not godly, how are they ſaid <hi>indeed to eſcape the pollutions of the world? Piſcator</hi> anſwereth, becauſe in the judgement of charity, and account of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers they were judged ſo. <hi>Beza</hi> better, <hi>indeed,</hi> that is comparatively with their falſe teachers, for they lived in all filthineſſe, yet counterfeited an holy life, but laſtly they did <hi>indeed</hi> leave the outward acts of wickedneſſe, as the Sow waſhed is <hi>indeed</hi> clean, but yet ſhe is not turned into a Sheep; ſo theſe truly and <hi>indeed</hi> had altered their manners, amended their outward lives, but were Swine, were Dogs ſtill. So that we affirm the Apoſtle to ſpeak of men not indeed regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but yet changed in their lives from their former wickedneſſe, and having no inward change, therefore it is that they fall, and falling their later end is worſe then their beginning, partly becauſe they ſinne with more knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and partly becauſe they ſinne with greater ingratitude and unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe for further mercies; and partly becauſe they ſtand not at a ſtay till they fall into ſome foul waies of doctrine or converſation: And thus much for the ſenſe of the words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That a great change made in a mans life by forſaking thoſe groſſe actual ſins he</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> 
                     <hi>once lived in, doth not preſently argue ſuch a mans converſion, or that he is indeed in a ſtate of grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Chriſtian may be a Swine, and yet waſhed. Thou that wert once a drunkard, a whoremonger, a ſwearer, maieſt have forſaken theſe ſins, and yet this alteration be in externals only, not internals. Though thou haſt <hi>eſcaped the pollutions of the world,</hi> yet not thoſe of thy heart, and therefore thou art ſtill in the ſtate of gall and wormwood. This is cleared in the fooliſh Virgins, who are called Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:30767:109"/>
becauſe they kept themſelves from the Idolatry and pollutions of the world; yet fooliſh, becauſe they had not oyl. Thus you have the Iſraelites ſeveral times throwing away their Idols, by which they had provoked God againſt them, and yet returning again to them: We may ſay, the Iſraelites did clean eſcape thoſe I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous pollutions, and they did it ſeriouſly, they were not groſſe diſſemblers; but becauſe their hearts were not changed, and they ſteadfaſt in this reformation, they were ſwine waſhed returning to the mire. <hi>Judas</hi> throweth away his unjuſt gain, with great terrour and ſorrow of heart, but he is a Goat, not a Sheep in Chriſts flock. I confeſſe this ſign ſeemeth to carry much probability with it; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſuch men, who have ſuperſeded their luſts, find a great deal of comfort: they rejoyce to ſee thoſe fetters and chains of their legs, which once luſt and the Divel had put on them, taken off. They were ſins priſoners, and went up and down in their ſhackles, but now they are out of this dungeon. <note place="margin">Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons concerning the point. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>To open the Doctrine, conſider theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt <hi>It cannot be denied but that the Scripture doth frequently comprehend the duty of repentance, and converſion to God, under theſe words, of forſaking our ſinns, caſting away our tranſgreſſions, turning away from our evil waies,</hi> &amp;c. Inſomuch that whereſoever there is ſuch a forſaking, ſuch a turning, there ſeemeth preſently to be the whole nature of converſion to God. Hence <hi>James</hi> calls it, <hi>Pure religion and undefiled, to keep our ſelves unspotted from the world.</hi> But all thoſe expreſſions do but contain part of the duty; for every forſaking, every turning from ſin, is not preſently, a gracious turning to God, as is to be ſhewed: Therefore think it not enough, That thou waſt indeed once ſuch a prophaner, ſuch a vain perſon, but now thou haſt left all ſuch courſes: Do not thou ſay, <hi>Behold a true Iſraelite in whom there is no guile:</hi> Behold a true child of God on whom are the ſure works of grace: For though thus outwardly waſhed, yet inwardly the filth may abound; though the outſide be fair, yet the Coar may be rotten within.</p>
                  <p>The reaſon why the Scripture deſcribeth converſion by external leaving of ſin, is, becauſe hereby our hatred and loathing of it is made more manifeſt, and none can ſay, <hi>They cleanſe their hearts, who do not alſo cleanſe their lives:</hi> It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth neceſſarily, That if the heart be waſhed, the outward converſation wil alſo be waſhed; but not on the contrary, that if the converſation be unpolluted, the heart is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>An outward reformation of life, and forſaking of ſin, may be from ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Outward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation may proceed from ſeveral princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</note> 
                     <hi>principles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the grace of ſanctification, which doth wholly alter, and change the nature of a man, putting new and ſpiritual affections, and inclinations in him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is carried out againſt ſin from the pure love of God, and delight in grace; and forſaking ſin from this ground, is onely comfortable.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another leaving of ſin, is from the reſtraining power, and providence of God, <note place="margin">II.</note> whereby bits and bridles are put into mans jaws, that they ruſh not out ſo madly into ſin as their impetuous luſts would carry them; and ſuch a forſaking of ſin, though it be outwardly for the glory of God, his name is not ſo much blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, others are not ſo much ſcandalized; yet it affords no true ſolid joy to him, that upon theſe terms only parts with his ſins.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is a repreſſing of ſin by the dictates of Nature, and the power of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <note place="margin">III.</note> precepts inſtilled into a man. Thus there is a famous ſtory of an Heathen, who was a debauched and prophane man, that went to hear <hi>Socrates</hi> read his lectures of Morality, with purpoſe to deride and ſcoff him; but he was ſo potently wrought upon by <hi>Socrates</hi> his precepts, that he went away changed, and never was ſuch a debauched man any more; and no queſtion it was from theſe natural dictates, with the common help, and aſſiſtance of God, that many heathens lived ſuch pure and unblameable lives. So then, if upon theſe three ſeveral ſtocks, the outward emendation of a mans life may grow, it behoveth every man, who hopes he is
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:30767:110"/>
now turned a penitent and a convert, to enquire from which of all theſe his change is made upon him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Mens luſts and ſins are for the moſt part ſo dear and ſweet to them, that it muſt be ſome great work either of grace Sanctifying, or grace reſtraining, that will make a man leave them.</hi> We ſee the Iſraelites would give all the wealth they had, yea, the very fruit of their womb to Oblations, rather then leave their accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed ſins: This makes our Saviour compare them to <hi>a right eye,</hi> and <hi>a right hand,</hi> as thoſe things which are moſt intimate, and dear unto us: And what is the ground of all that malice, and hatred againſt the word of God, and ſoul-ſearching Truth, but onely mens inordinate love and affection to their ſins? Inſomuch that when you ſee any wicked man leave his accuſtomed ſins, you may with wonder cry out, <hi>What aileth this Jordan to turn backward, and this Iron to ſwim? How cometh this Blackamore to a white skin?</hi> Though therefore it be no ſure ſign, yet it is a great duty: we may go out to ſee it as a great wonder in a pariſh, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold! once a Swearer, once a Blaſphemer, but now he doth ſo no more!</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Though this outward alteration argue no grace in the heart, yet it is to be acknowledged as a merciful work of God.</hi> When the word of God, though it <note place="margin">4. Yet outward reformation is a mercy.</note> doth not work to converſion from ſin, yet it doth to repreſſion of ſin: ſo that men; though they ceaſe not to be wicked, from holy principles, yet they do from a ſtrong aw and fear which Gods word bringeth upon their conſciences: ſo in that <hi>Herod</hi> feared <hi>John,</hi> and was thereby reſtrained fom many ſins, though not from all, is was very laudable. Thus King <hi>Joſha,</hi> that kept from ſeveral wicked waies, as long as <hi>Jehoiadah</hi> the Prieſt was alive, it was a mercy.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>For hereby</hi> ſeveral good iſſues flow, as God is hereby leſſe diſhonoured: a <note place="margin">I.</note> Chriſtian prophane in his life, blaſphemes the name of God; thy Oaths, Luſts are a kind of blaſphemy againſt God: where therefore there is a forbearance of theſe, God is leſſe diſhonoured, let the grounds be what they will be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Again,</hi> hereby Gods wrath is not provoked ſo quickly againſt a people, to <note place="margin">II.</note> deſtroy them with temporal judgements: <hi>Be not evermuch wicked</hi> (ſaith <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtes) Why ſhouldeſt thou die before thy time?</hi> and thus for Oaths, Injuſtice, and Oppreſſion, the land mourneth: Hence groſſe ſins, are called <hi>crying ſins,</hi> becauſe they make a noiſe in Gods ear, importuning for vengeance: now it is a mercy to a place when no ſuch crying ſins are committed, when God is not importuned to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume a place.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>It is good,</hi> becauſe hereby godlineſſe hath a repute, and an eſteem, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe <note place="margin">III.</note> hath a diſcouragement and brand upon it. The Scriptures ſpeaks <hi>of an whores fore-head, and a face that could not be aſhamed:</hi> Now it is well when Gods Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry hath brought ſin into ſuch an <hi>Odium,</hi> and matter of ſhame, that none of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, any care, dareth commit any vile ſin: and Oh that in all our congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if there were not ſuch ſanctifying grace, yet ſuch ingenuous diſpoſitions wrought in men by the light of the Word, that men would ſay, <hi>I am taught better, I know better, I ſcorn and am aſhamed to ſerve any luſt, or commit any known ſin: thoſe that are drunk</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>are drunk in the night,</hi> and ſo thoſe that ſteal, <hi>ſteal in the night.</hi> Thus let <hi>Aſhkelon</hi> and <hi>Gath,</hi> let <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> who are in the night and dark, have wickedneſſe committed amongſt them; but let not <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> or <hi>Sion,</hi> who is in the light, thus ſtumble in the day and fall. How much is it to be deplored, that where the Goſpel is received, and the word of God read, and preached, every prophane perſon ſhould not be as much aſhamed to ſhew his head, as a theif when he is taken?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Here is this good comes by forſaking of ſin, though not upon right principles, <note place="margin">IIII.</note> that others are not encouraged to imitate and do the like. Sins in the Text are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led pollutions contagions, they have a peſtilential infection with them; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſo, how good is it when this arrow doth not walk abroad that would deſtroy at mid-day! Certainly if we praiſe God heartily for the abating of the plague, or
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:30767:110"/>
ſword, which have ſuch open mouths to devour, may we not much rather bleſſe God for freedom from groſſe ſins in the place where thou liveſt? If thou loveſt thy ſelf, thy family, thy relations, thou canſt not but rejoyce to live, where they ſhall learn from others to do that, which is according to God and his Law.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It is a mercy, becauſe where ſuch great impieties are reſtrained, there is leſs <note place="margin">V.</note> grief, and trouble to the Godly. <hi>Eſai</hi> cryeth out, <hi>Wo be to me, becauſe I live among men of polluted lips:</hi> and <hi>David, Wo be to me, becauſe I live in the wilderneſſe of Meſhech:</hi> And the ſame good man bewailed his exile among thoſe that knew not God. <hi>Lot</hi> was tormented as in hell, with ſeeing, and hearing the ungodly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the <hi>Sodomites:</hi> So that where God doth not work to regeneration, if yet he doth to reſtraining and binding up of mens corruptions, that their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe doth not make the place an hell to live in, the godly do much praiſe him for it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Though leaving of ſin do not alway argue an intereſt in Chriſt, and an <note place="margin">VI.</note> evidence for heaven, yet ſuch men ſhall have leſs torments in hell; their judgement will be eaſier. Thus <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, <hi>Camillus</hi> will be leſs puniſhed in hell then <hi>Catali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e;</hi> and ſo a wicked man forſaking his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ear luſts and ſins, though not upon Sanctified principles, ſhall have more Temporal bleſſings here and leſſe puniſhment hereafter, then thoſe that wilfully perſevere in them.</p>
                  <p>Let us in the next place conſider, Why a meer forſaking of ſin, or a reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in externals, is not enough: and this will be manifeſt from ſeveral demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe (as was intimated) ſin may be left from forced principles without,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Why an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forſaking of ſin is no true ſign of Grace.</note> 
                     <hi>not ſanctified grace within.</hi> Forced principles are terrors of conſcience, grievous judgements of God, whereby a man is taken off from his ſins, as a maſtive is pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led off from worrying a ſheep, and ſucking its ſweet blood, by putting red hot Iron in his mouth. Nothing but a flaming fiery ſword can keep him off from ſin, which he accounted paradiſe: But that which is comfortable reforming of a mans life, is when a ſupernatural principle is infuſed within, whereby we are made new creatures; and ſo from the love of God, and his holineſs, ariſeth all our hatred and loathing of ſin. Thus the Apoſtle abhors that which is evil, cleaves to that which is good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. When our hating of ſin like hell, ariſeth from a ſweet intimate cleaving to good as glue, (for ſo the word implies) this is matter of rejoycing. We ſee in nature, operations follow the nature and eſſence of a thing; therefore departing from evil is not kindly, till it come from a pure, and ſanctified na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>A meer leaving of ſin, is not perfectly a touchſtone of grace, becauſe it may be done unwillingly, with great grief that we cannot keep our luſts ſtill:</hi> And <note place="margin">2.</note> this is a conſequent from the former particular; for when we leave ſin from forced principles, there is a great deal of reluctancy: Thus <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the Iſraelites under Gods judgements, they go from ſin as <hi>Phaltiel</hi> was taken from his wife, <hi>They run crying after them to have them again.</hi> Oh, this is the wretched temper of too many; they have an heart to do thus, to live thus, and they are grieved their luſts cannot be accompliſhed, but other things keep them they dare not; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>The evil he would not do, yet he did it, but ſtill he delighted in the Law of God in the inner man.</hi> So theſe, the good they would not do, yet they are compelled to do; and therefore ſtill they delight in the law of ſin, and with their mindes they ſerve it: do not many caſt away their ſins, as the Marriners did <hi>Jonah</hi> out of the ſhip in the ſea? they uſed firſt all the means they could to keep him in, and when that could not be, <hi>then with great trouble of ſpirit they threw him away.</hi> Thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny uſe all means ſecretly, publickly to keep their ſins, plead for the lawfulneſs of them, excuſe the committing of them, till a tempeſt of Gods wrath is ſo violent upon them, that they cannot hold them any longer: Oh, therefore if thou wer't once ſo and ſo, but now waſhed, now no ſuch ulcers and ſores are upon thee, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:30767:111"/>
with what willingneſſe, delight, and joy in God this is done, if otherwiſe, ſay not, <hi>Grace is in thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Therefore may not leaving of actual ſin, be a good teſtimony, becauſe this</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>is not accompanied with mortifying ſin in the root, and in the body of it;</hi> For that on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is the true forſaking of ſin, which goeth to the very bottom of all, which layeth the Ax to the root of the tree, which endeavors to kill the dam with the young ones, which would deſtroy ſin as they did <hi>Jericho,</hi> never to be built again. Thus <hi>David</hi> repenting of thoſe groſs actual ſins, goeth to the Fountain, his polluted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and unclean, bitterly bewailing that: hence alſo the Apoſtle calleth for <hi>cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifying of the fleſh,</hi> as well <hi>as the luſts of ſin.</hi> The Scripture ſpeaks of <hi>the body of ſin, as well as members thereof,</hi> and exhorts <hi>to the mortifying of one, as well as another:</hi> And <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. In that great combat and conflict, he fights not with ſmall ſins or great, but the king, <hi>Original pollution. Sampſon</hi> did but cut his hair, and when that grew, all his ſtrength grew up again; if it had been pulled up by the root, then he had recovered his power no more, ſo it is here. If actual ſins be onely circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, pared off, and not a pulling them up by the roots, they all increaſe to their former prevalency again. Know then, it is not enough to dry up the ſtreams, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the fountain alſo be: ſee how the root and ſeed-plot of all luſt, and ſin in thy heart is conſumed, and then there is hopes thou biddeſt thy ſins be gone upon right terms; otherwiſe this falling <hi>out of lovers, will be the renewing of love;</hi> or as water caſt upon the Iron, makes it burn the more vehemently, ſo will this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance a while from ſin afterward inflame thee ſeven times the hotter: and certainly here ought our ſorrow and hatred to be moſt vigorous, becauſe here ſin is in its ſtrength and power.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Therefore may we not take comfort from meer external reformation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it may be nothing but the change of groſſe ſins, into a channel of Spiritual, and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>more refined ſins.</hi> Now this is onely to change ſuch Tyrant-ſins, but not the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of ſin. The Phariſees they carefully avoided all groſs Publican ſins: they thank God, <hi>they are no drunkards, publicans, adulterers;</hi> but what then? <hi>they are proud, covetous, ſuperſtitious;</hi> they avoid groſs ſin corporally, but they greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file themſelves with other ſins ſpiritually. A man diſeaſed with diſtillation of humours, if the Phyſitian do not remove the humour, but divert it to ſome other part, that is more vital and dangerous, he doth not cure, but kill his patient; and thus it is here, that flux of blood, that noiſom ſore of ſin, which did run out in a bodily way, is turned now into a mental way of pride, ſelf-confidence, ſelf-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs; and thus as many times the drying up of ſores and iſſues, ſtrikes preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the heart, and kils immediately, ſo doth the forſaking of groſs ſins fill thy heart with ſelf-love ſelfd-elight, &amp; hereby thy eſtate is more dangerous then ever.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Take not comfort preſently from thy leaving of ſin, for it may be only a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial</hi>

If it be onely general, hiſtorical faith of matters contained in the Scripture, this is too weak and languiſhing; it is one thing to leave ſin from meer illumination in the head, and another from a powerful inflammation, and renovation of the heart; thou muſt with thy heart, and ſoul, and ſtrength love God, and leave ſin, as well as with the mind.</p>

                  <p>HAving in ſeveral inſtances diſcovered the weakneſſe of thoſe <hi>props,</hi> which moſt lean upon in reference to Salvation, I ſhall conclude this matter with a diſcourſe upon the Diſciples pathetical exclamation in the Text, <hi>Who then can be ſaved?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the verſe precedent, we have mention made of one, who had good wiſhes and deſires for heaven, but being put by our Saviour upon an exploratory duty, it proved like jealouſie water to him, diſcovering his rottenneſſe; he was a ſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious brood of the Eagle, for he was not able to endure theſe pure Sun-beams, <hi>He went away ſorrowfull, for he had many poſſeſſions.</hi> It doth not ſay, for he loved them, but he had them, it being very difficult to have theſe things, and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately love them: they were <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> indeed, becauſe they poſſeſſed him, rather then he poſſeſſed them. He had much wealth, as we ſay, a man hath a feavor, when that hath him, deſtroying and waſting his health. Upon this we have our Saviour uttering a ſtrange and paradoxal ſpeech to fleſh and bloud, Chriſts words were miracles as well as his works, <hi>It is hard for a rich man to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> compare this with <hi>Mark</hi> 10. and there are ſeveral aggravations; firſt, our Saviour ſaith, <hi>its hard; Mark</hi> ſaith, he ſpake it with admiration, <hi>How hard is it?</hi> Then this he affirmeth with a vehement aſſeverati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>verily,</hi> yea <hi>Mark</hi> ſaith, He looked about him, to ſignifie he had ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary thing to ſay, and therefore would have them attentive, yea the Evangeliſt ſaith, <hi>he ſighed</hi> alſo, when he ſpake this further he ſpake this to his Diſciples, though not rich, as appeareth by that compellation in <hi>Mark, Sonne, how hard is it,</hi> &amp;c? as a tender father he bids them beware.</p>
                  <p>In the next place Chriſt doth not only ſhew the difficulty, but at laſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility by a proverbial ſpeech, <hi>It is as impoſſible for a rich man to be ſaved, as a Camel to go thorow the eye of a needle,</hi> a Proverb in the Eaſtern parts to expreſſe an impoſſibility. Thoſe that would underſtand it of a <hi>Cable-rope,</hi> as they miſtake about the Greek word, ſo they conſider not the greater impoſſibility is implied in the phraſe the more ſignificant it is. Now this ſpeech of our Saviours is an hard ſpeech, but thou art not to expoſtulate or contend with Gods Miniſters about it, for truth it ſelf hath ſaid it: only by rich men, <hi>Mark</hi> expounds thoſe who truſt
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:30767:112"/>
in them, but <hi>Matthew</hi> ſpeaks it abſolutely, becauſe of the difficulty not to truſt in them, when we have them. Upon this ſpeech of our Saviours, we ſee a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble operation on the Diſciples, expreſſed firſt in their outward diſpoſition, and then in their ſpeech. In their diſpoſition <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, they were ſtricken with amazement, it was with them, as if they had had ſome aſtoniſhing blow given them; &amp; then you have their admiration, <hi>who then can be ſaved?</hi> This implieth that they thought before they heard this a very poſſible, if not an eaſie thing to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, but now they deſpair of it: But why do they ſay, who then can be ſaved in the general, and not rather what rich man? for of them our Saviour ſpake, ſuch poor men as the Diſciples might be ſaved for all this. it is anſwered thus, though all men are not rich, yet all men have a deſire and appetite after riches, and ſo they are thereby ſtopped in their courſe to heaven. Or thus, Though all men are not rich, yet as rich men have their wealth which they immoderately relie on: So there is no man but he hath ſome creature or other, he doth inordinatly affect, and that makes him a Camel with too big a bunch to go in the ſtrait way to Heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That howſoever men may ſuggeſt to themſelves many probable and eaſie grounds for</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obſ.</hi> Salvation dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, and in ſome ſenſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</note> 
                     <hi>their ſalvation, yet upon Scripture-conſideration it will appear a great difficulty, yea in ſome ſenſe an impoſſibility.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the Diſciples while they happily attended only to Chriſt his gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations and manifold promiſes of his love, they thought it a very eaſie matter to get to heaven; They found nothing but honey come out of his mouth. Now when they hear our Saviour ſpeak of the exact qualification of him that ſhall be ſaved, they are affected with fear as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were, who thought it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to poſſeſſe <hi>Canaan,</hi> becauſe of the tall <hi>Anakims</hi> that muſt firſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered.</p>
                  <p>For the clearing of the Doctrine, let theſe three things be premiſed; <note place="margin">Three things premiſed for clearing the Doctrine. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, That when we ſay it is ſuch a difficult and impoſſible thing to be ſaved, we do not relate to that natural impoſſibility which is in every man; for ſo not only rich men, but even infants new-born, it's as impoſſible for them to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as a Camel to go thorow the eye of a needle; for ſeeing all are by nature dead in ſinne; we can no more put ſpiritual life in our ſelves, then <hi>Adam</hi> could at firſt have made himſelf of a lump of earth, a living ſoul. We do not then fetch this impoſſibility of Salvation ſo much from the weakneſſe of nature, as from the exactneſſe of the way of grace, for our Saviour in the Text laieth not this impoſſibility upon the impotency and inability of a man in reſpect of original defilement, though this ſtream will by long windings at laſt empty it ſelf into that fountain, but upon the curious bounds that grace preſcribes our affections even to lawful things; ſo that although we may love and deſire, and uſe theſe creature-comforts, yet if we go but one ſtep beyond thoſe limits, we have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently tranſgreſſed; and ſo when our Saviour ſaith upon this to comfort the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples with ſome hopes, <hi>with God all things are poſſible.</hi> Though it be univerſally true, yet it is more peculiarly to be limited to the matter in hand, God can level this Camels bunch, he can command the waters of our affections to ſtand ſtill, and not to overflow.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This therefore may be extended not only to a natural man in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate eſtate, but even to a regenerated perſon, ſo that we may cry out, <note place="margin">2.</note> What godly man can be ſaved? The work of grace is ſo exact, temptations are ſo great, corruptions are ſo ſtrong, that we may ſay, Who of the godly can be ſaved? for though Gods grace will give them to perſevere, as Chriſts preſence in the ſhip did or might aſſure them they could not periſh, yet when they ſaw their danger, and were in tempeſts and ſtorms, they cried out, <hi>Maſter ſave us, we periſh;</hi> ſo even a godly man, though while he look to the Covenant of grace he may anchor his ſoul ſecurely; yet at the ſame time beholding his temptations and infirmities, he may frequently cry out, O Lord, ſupport me, I am falling
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:30767:113"/>
into hell; we will therefore ſuppoſe a man in the ſtate of grace, yet, were it not <hi>that with God all things are poſſible,</hi> this godly man would make ſhipwrack of his ſoul a thouſand times over ere he could get into that glorious haven. Thus <hi>Peter 1 Pet. 4. 18. The righteous is ſcarcely ſaved,</hi> which although it be principally meant of temporal deliverance, yet ſpiritual ſalvation is by neceſſary conſequence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Although this be true, yet it muſt be acknowledged, that if we do <note place="margin">3.</note> reſpect the grace of Chriſt, and his fulneſſe, it is a very eaſie thing to be ſaved; for let ſin abound in the guilt and power of it, yet grace in the juſtifying and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying effects of it, doth much more abound. Hence Gods mercy in pardoning is compared to the heavens, and our ſins are but like the earth a <hi>punctum</hi> in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 9. or as a drop of the water to the Sun-beams, which is quickly dried up. In the fift of the <hi>Romans</hi> you have an excellent oppoſition between the ſecond and firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſhewing how much more potent Chriſt is to ſave, and grace to give life, then <hi>Adam</hi> was to deſtroy, or ſinne to curſe and condemn; in which reſpect Chriſt is ſaid to give life, and that more abundantly; now this is to be marked by the dejected, tempted heart, which ſeldom looks up to grace, but to all the difficulties that are in heavens way. They cry out, O never godly, never believing, never coming up to Scripture-principles; but they do not joyn Gods power and their infirmity, Gods grace, and their guilt together; They do not ſay, O Lord, becauſe this is impoſſible to me, Is it alſo to thee? Becauſe I have ſinned away my own grace, Have I alſo ſinned away Chriſts ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?</p>
                  <p>Therefore minde the ſtrict qualifications to make thee walk humbly in fear and trembling, minde the gracious fulneſſe of Gods love and power to make thee full <note place="margin">What makes ſalvation ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to a mans natural thoughts. 1.</note> of hope and comfort. Put the Camels bunch and Gods power together.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things premiſed, let us conſider what are thoſe conſiderations that make ſalvation ſo eaſie to a mans natural thoughts.</p>
                  <p>And the firſt is, <hi>A repreſentation of God altogether pitifull and mercifull, without taking any notice of his purity and his juſtice, that he is a God Who will not acquit the guilty.</hi> This half repreſentation of God unto a mans heart, makes him thus confident. Men argue, How can we think God, who ſaith, <hi>He would not the death of a ſinner,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>Why will ye die, O houſe of Iſrael;</hi> Who hath put pity into mens hearts, ſhall not much more be a fountain when ſtreams are ſo plentiful? This hath been aggravated ſo much, that it hath been an opinion of ſome, that at laſt all men, yea and devils alſo ſhall be ſaved: but the Scripture ſpeaks of Gods ſting as well as his honey, of his fury as well as his pity; The Scripture ſpeaketh of his rejoycing in the deſtruction of the wicked, as well as pitying them; Do not thou therefore deceive thy own ſoul, by minding Gods mercy meerly. Gods juſtice is to finde out thoſe, who have abuſed mercy, and he is a fire to conſume as well as to give light.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond ground which makes ſalvation ſo eaſie, <hi>is the general offer and tender</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>of Gods grace by his Word, whereby none ſeem to be exempted:</hi> Now if to this be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, a doctrinal opinion alſo, which doth abound in theſe daies, <hi>viz.</hi> univerſal Grace, and univerſal Redemption, they now quickly perſwade themſelves the way to heaven is a broad way; but this Doctrine doth quite overthrow the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of a particular Election of ſome only to ſalvation, which yet the Scripture manifeſtly declareth, and it puts the whole diſcriminating event of a mans ſelf from others, into the hands of free-will: for if <hi>Judas</hi> have as much of the grace of God, and as much by the death of Chriſt, as <hi>Peter;</hi> the onely reaſon why <hi>Peter</hi> doth repent and <hi>Judas</hi> not, is meerly, becauſe the one improveth his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er well, and the other doth not. Therefore although general tenders of grace are enough to encourage thoſe that are hungry and thirſty after it, and ſuch as are burdened by ſinne; yet they lay no foundation at all for ſuch an univerſality
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:30767:113"/>
of grace as they pretend to; neither do we lay a foundation of deſpair in this, for we ſay, this grace doth truly belong to every one <hi>that believeth and repenteth;</hi> And the Arminian cannot go further, he dare not ſay, This grace belongs to you whether you believe or not, repent or not: ſo that we are as univerſal in pouring of oil into wounded ſouls, as they are.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Salvation is thought eaſie, <hi>Becauſe of a miſtake about faith: Oh ſay they,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>if a man do but believe, then heaven is his, Chriſt is his: as to him that believeth not condemnation belongeth.</hi> Now all naturall men think it a very eaſie thing to believe, What, to truſt in Chriſt with all thy heart? how ready is every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man to ſay, he doth it? And upon this it is, that the Papiſts charge us as making it ſuch an eaſie pleaſing way to go to Heaven; It's but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving (ſay they) and then all is well. But all this is a miſtake about faith; he that ſaith, Faith is eaſie, never knew what it is to believe: To preſume is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, to be ſecure and ſelf-flattering is eaſie; but out of the true ſenſe of ſinne and deep humiliation for it to relie on Gods grace; this the godly heart findes not to be done without many conflicts and ſpiritual agonies; faith therefore is made the work of Gods Spirit, and it is that which the devil doth moſt oppoſe, becauſe that doth moſt withſtand him.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Therefore men make it eaſie to goe to Heaven, They may ſeek that in</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>the laſt place, Live in all jollity, and then to cry, Lord have mercy on me at the laſt gaſp is enough, becauſe they wholly miſtake what true Godlineſſe and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is.</hi> What godlineſſe is they underſtand not, they think not of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing borne again, of the pangs and travail the ſoul commonly is in, before it is thus formed; They conſider not the way to Heaven is a <hi>ſtrait way, and few that enter therein;</hi> if they did, could they be ſo ſilly, as to think ſuch vicious lives as they live, ſuch formality and morality they continue in, were the way to Heaven? Certainly if this be ſo, then the Scripture ſpeaks falſly, <hi>Strait is the way,</hi> Mat. 7. 13, 14. No, broad is the way, large are the paths, and few miſſe them; You therefore think it eaſie to be ſaved, becauſe you take copper for gold, counterfeits for pearls; and thus a man may think himſelf ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rich, when he is indeed very poor. Again, they miſtake about repentance, for they think all kinde of ſorrow for ſinne, every Lord have mercy upon them, eſpecially if this be with tears, a true Repentance; but if this be ſo we may cry out contrary to the Diſciples, <hi>Who will not be ſaved?</hi> Then bleſſed <hi>Ahab,</hi> godly <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> holy <hi>Judas,</hi> for all theſe more or leſſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged their ſinne, and begged for pardon; But if thou examine Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and ſee how much goeth to godly ſorrow, what principle it muſt come from, what motives muſt produce it, what effects flow from it; Thou wilt be amazed, and ſay, O Lord, I doubt I never truly repented, my tears are too ſalt to come from a contrite heart in a gracious manner. Now doe but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve all thoſe men who are ſecure and confident about their ſalvation, you may as ſoon perſwade them a Blackmore is white, as they beginne to have the leaſt doubt and ſuſpition about themſelves; and you ſhall ſee its one of theſe pillars they lean upon, if this their foundation were razed all their hopes were gone. Could you drive them out of this refuge then they would cry out, <hi>Men and brethren. What ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us therefore in the next place conſider, why upon Scripture-grounds, <note place="margin">Why it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful grace for any man to be ſaved. 1.</note> it will appear ſuch an impoſſibility without Gods wonderfull grace; for a man, yea a godly man to be ſaved; ſo that of all miracles, it will be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, to ſee a godly man paſſing all the Rocks here, and ſafely lodged in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>And firſt it appeareth a wonder, <hi>If you conſider that grace in a mans heart is not in its natural ſoyl.</hi> It's like an Herb tranſplanted and put into ſome ground it doth not agree with. Now it's a wonder this herb of Grace doth not wither, alas the ſoil helps nothing to it. God gave command at firſt to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:30767:114"/>
the earth to bring forth graſſe; but alas our hearts cannot do ſo: Grace in our hearts is like a ſtranger in a ſtrange Land, like a ſpark of fire in the deep ocean, like a candle in a boiſterous windy night, it's a wonder if it do not go out. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if <hi>Adam</hi> ſo quickly loſt his grace, when yet it was connatural to him, his heart was a fit ſoil; were it not for the Covenant of Grace, which fails not, a godly man would fall ſeven times a day wholly from God, as well as the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaith he doth ſo often in temporal calamities. Oh then wonder how any grace comes to be alive in thy heart, that thoſe coals are not ſmothered up, that every night thou doſt not as that mother lie upon thy childe, and thorow ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and negligence kill this poor infant of grace.</p>

Thus <hi>David</hi> was kept from murdering <hi>Nabal;</hi> and as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 10. By the grace of God I am what I am;</hi> So he might have ſaid (ſaith <hi>Auſtin) By the grace of God I am not what I am not.</hi> Yea Divines ſay, <hi>Plures ſunt gratiae privativae quam poſitivae,</hi> Gods prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercies are more then his poſitive mercies. Oh therefore think, If the grace of God did not keep off this ſinne, this luſt, this temptation, how had it ſwallowed thee up, as the Whale did <hi>Jonah!</hi> Again, There is <hi>protecting grace,</hi> and that is, when thou art in the midſt of all temptations, yet grace defends thee, and thou ſinneſt not; we wonder at Gods miraculous deliverance to <hi>Daniel,</hi> who was kept alive in the midſt of roaring Lions.

There is alſo <hi>quickning grace,</hi> whereby the principles of holineſſe are daily blown up and enlivened; now if this bellows were not alwaies blowing, if this were not alwaies filling our ſails, we ſhould lie like ſo many dry bones; This winde muſt ariſe ere they can come together. <hi>David</hi> found the neceſſity of this, when he ſo often praied, <hi>That God would quicken him.</hi> Thy very graces would lie &amp; ruſt away, were there not this exciting grace; Do not the people of God fal into divers lethargies and hurtful ſleeps, becauſe of the want of this. Again, there is cooperating grace, which goeth along with us to do, as well as to purpoſe in our heart: Its Gods grace that <hi>worketh in us not only to will but to do,</hi> Phil. 2. 13. when we have deſires and affections to duties, how many times are we diverted, and through lazineſſe or diſtractions interrupted, but grace car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth us out to the work it ſelf. There is alſo <hi>corroborating grace,</hi> whereby the principles of holineſſe, being weak and unſteady, are confirmed and ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned more and more; for grace though it keeps us from ſin, yet carrieth us on to holineſſe weakly and faintly. Thus he praied, <hi>I believe, help my unbelief,</hi> Mar. 9. 24. <hi>Thus the fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, and the Spirit againſt the fleſh,</hi> that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times they do the things they would not, <hi>Gal. 5. 17. Paul</hi> cals this to be <hi>ſtrong in the might of the Lord; and I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me. Paul</hi> hath a kinde of omnipotency, and to him all <hi>things are poſſible,</hi> becauſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to grace which inableth him. Laſtly, There is <hi>perſevering Grace;</hi> for let a man be furniſhed with all the former fruits of grace, yet if this of perſeverance be not added, their works are not crowned; when we do things <gap reason="foreign">

Thy wife, thy children, thy houſes, thy trade, theſe kill thee by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret poiſon, whereas groſſe ſins deſtroy by open ſword. One of the Ancients in a viſion ſaw the world full of ſnares, and ſo it is; a ſhop is a ſnare, wife, children are ſnares. Our Saviour on purpoſe ſheweth this in that Parable, where thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to the feaſt, ſay not, I am a drunkard, a ſwearer, and cannot or will not come, <hi>but I have bought, and I have married, and therefore cannot come,</hi> Luk. 14. 20.

There is two things in ſitting or winnowing, the one is concuſſion and tumbling of the corn and chaff, or refuſe together; the other is the ſeparation of the good from the bad; now the devil he deſired the firſt only, to mingle grace and corruption, to bring them all into a confuſion, and ſo overcome them. Now did not Chriſt powerfully intercede, our faith would quickly fail in ſuch extremities. That ſame Parable of a man going to <hi>Jericho</hi> and meeting with thieves, was miſerably wounded, being left half dead, if it may be applied to a mans ſpiritual eſtate, is not meant of him before converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or in his natural eſtate, for he is wholly dead, but after his converſion many times foiled by Satan, and therefore needs oil and balm continually.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Ur work formerly hath been to ſhew the poſſibility of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves to be in the ſtate of grace, as alſo the lawfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of proceeding by ſigns: We have alſo diſcovered what are true ſigns, and what inſufficient. The next thing therefore in order is to handle the nature of the ſtate of grace, which becauſe the Scripture expreſſeth in ſeverall words, all which have a peculiar notion with them, we ſhall take them in order:</p>
                  <p>And firſt I ſhall begin with the expreſſion of <hi>regeneration</hi> or <hi>new-birth,</hi> out of theſe words, which are part of a remarkable Hiſtory, <hi>viz,</hi> a Dialogue between Chriſt and <hi>Nicodemus;</hi> wherein is in a moſt lively manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the ignorance and ſtupidity even of the moſt learned and knowing men about the work of regeneration; and certainly it is of infinite conſequence that the holy Ghoſt hath left a full teſtimony of the ſtupidity of thoſe in this matter who were reputed the Maſters of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Text you have a Propoſition, <hi>unleſſe a man be born again,</hi> &amp;c, then the aſſeveration, <hi>verily, verily.</hi> It's obſerved that whereas other Evangeliſts uſe this aſſeveration ſeldom, or if ſo, ſingly only. The Evangeliſt <hi>John</hi> for the moſt part doubleth it: ſome aſſign one cauſe, ſome another, but it may be attributed to the peculiar diſpoſition of <hi>John,</hi> for the Spirit of God uſeth their peculiar abilities to his work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:30767:116"/>
In the next place there is the occaſion of theſe words, implied in that, <hi>Jeſus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,</hi> for it doth not appear to what words of <hi>Nicodemus</hi> Chriſt doth anſwer, and therefore the ground of this ſpeech ſeemeth very difficult to finde out. In the New Teſtament to anſwer is ſometimes no more then to begin to ſpeak, not deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any relation to a diſcourſe going before: but here it may well be connected to the words before: Either thus, as ſome, Thou thinkeſt, <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> I am a meer Prophet only, Thou lookeſt upon me only as a man ſent from God, verily thou canſt not perceive or diſcern any more, unleſſe thou art regenerated. Others think more probably that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> after that honourable compellation given our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, did then enquire how he might be made partaker of the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, only the Evangeliſt did not relate it, becauſe our Saviours anſwer did ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently manifeſt it.</p>
                  <p>We come then to the Propoſition, where is conſiderable, 1. the ſubject, then the attribute: The ſubject, <hi>unleſſe a man be born again,</hi> wherein mark the univerſality, <hi>unleſſe a man,</hi> he doth not ſay, Unleſſe thou, including hereby every one: And be <hi>born again,</hi> he doth not ſay, be healed, or cured, or reſtored to health, but born again; The greek word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> ſome make from above, as it is uſed afterwards in the Chapter: but it's plain that it ſignifieth as much as <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, by the reply of <hi>Nicodemus, how can a man be born the ſecond time:</hi> The attribute is, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God, that is, poſſeſſe it, as the Latiniſts ſay, <hi>cernere haereditatem,</hi> by this is meant, not the preſent diſpenſation of grace, but future glory in heaven.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Without regeneration there is no ſalvation.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obſerv.</hi> No ſalvation without rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not enough to be born once naturally, but we muſt be alſo a ſecond time ſpiritually. The main thing to clear this doctrine, will be to ſhew what regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, and I ſhall do that firſt negatively, then poſitively:</p>
                  <p>What it is not. <note place="margin">What regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is not. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And firſt, <hi>It is not as Nicodemus groſly conceived, a ſecond entring into the womb;</hi> It's a wonder that <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a learned man, not in <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> or humane arts, but in the Law of God, in the Scriptures, where he had read of a new heart, and taking away the heart of ſtone, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. yet ſhould apprehend no better: but though a man could in a naturall way be born a thouſand times over, yet ſuch is that abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable defilement and peſtilential contagion in every one, that this natural being can be no more made glorious in heaven then a black coal a glorious Starre. Thus our Saviour afterwards ſhewing the ground of regeneration, ſaith, <hi>That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh.</hi> What a folly then is it to glory in a mans birth, a Prince, a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman, a Gentleman by birth! for though theſe have priviledges among men, yet they do not exempt from curſes before God: Oh that thoſe who glory in their bloud could diſcover well the works of Gods Spirit in them, and this is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally true, even of thoſe who have excellent, ingenious, good natures, ſuch as <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naventure</hi> of whom by an <hi>hyperbole</hi> it was ſaid, <hi>In hoc homine non peccavit Adam:</hi> This good nature, this kinde, this ingenious nature muſt be born from above; It muſt not only have external culture and dreſſing, but internall alteration, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that it burneth in hell as well as others.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Its not, in another extremity, to have a new phyſicall being,</hi> As not to loſe the eſſentials we had of a ſoul and the faculties thereof: ſome have confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly <note place="margin">2.</note> talked of a tranſubſtantiation into the being of God, and tels us of a ſtrange deification, or being made God with God. Theſe men have affected uncouth and obſolete expreſſions, as the Paracelſians do in Phyſick: No, though born of God, yet not made God, only we have the image of God in us, and that which is by way of ſubſtance in him is only by accident in us. It is true, the Scripture calleth it a divine nature, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. a new creature, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. the inward man, and this made <hi>Illyricus</hi> with his followers at leaſt in words to erre, (for ſome excuſe his ſenſe) when he ſaid, The ſubſtance of a man is corrupted, and ſo his ſubſtance muſt be changed. It's true the Scripture uſeth ſuch expreſſions to ſhew how reall, intimate, and fixed the work of grace is; It's not a notion, it's not a fancy; No
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:30767:116"/>
more then to be a man, to live, to ſpeak, to eat is. Thus grace where it is, makes a wonderfull alteration, though not in the eſſence, yet in the qualities and operations of a man, ſo that in a Theologicall ſenſe he is wholly a new man, he is not the ſame he was: and this is diſcovered as really and powerfully in him, as when <hi>Adam</hi> out of nothing was made a man: Take heed then of being in the number of thoſe who account all the change wrought by Gods Spirit in a man, to be only a melancholy fancy, and attribute all to ſuch cloudy imaginations, or elſe ſpeak of it, as a particular conſtitution and temperament of the body: No, The Scripture would never call grace by ſuch reall powerfull names, if it had not alſo as reall and powerfull effects: ſo that regeneration is a reall, ſupernaturall change in a man, as when of dead a man is made alive, of fooliſh, wiſe; not a relative change, as when a man is made an Husband or Magiſtrate, wherein his principles and heart are not altered.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>It's more then an outward acceptation and acknowledgement of the waies of Chriſt.</hi> For though this ſeem to be a great converſion, dead men begin <note place="margin">3.</note> to live, yet our Saviour extendeth his ſenſe further: ſo univerſall and generall as corruption hath been, ſo extenſive muſt the reſtauration of the ſoul be. The Jews called their Proſelytes <hi>recens natos,</hi> new-born; but to be a Proſelyte externally, not inwardly changed in our natures, is not this regeneration in the Text: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this new birth is the greateſt riddle in the world, even to thoſe who may out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly very readily ſubmit to the waies of Chriſt: why then do men reſt ſatisfied in this externall profeſſion, as if nothing elſe were more required? May not Chriſt look upon thee as he did on the fig-tree, ſee leaves but no fruit, and ſo eternally curſe thee? Thou, though turned from Paganiſm or Popery, yet art not new-born, till God hath changed that Tygers nature of thine into a Lamb; ſay then, O Lord, I do not only deſire new eyes, new ears, new hands, but a new heart, and a new nature.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>This is not that morall and civill deportment of a mans ſelf, which may be attained by humane precepts and helps of Philoſophy.</hi> Although Heathens <note place="margin">4.</note> have called the new moulding of our lives, a new-birth: and <hi>Nobis ad arbitrium noſtrum naſcilicet,</hi> ſaid <hi>Seneca,</hi> we may be born what we will; yet this is farre ſhort of that heavenly and ſpirituall birth the Scripture diſcovers, ſo that as our Saviour of all ſubjects thought this moſt neceſſary to inſiſt upon with <hi>Nicodemus:</hi> the like ought the Miniſters of Gods Word to do: for ſeeing all people generally are ſo full of ſelf-righteouſneſſe, pleaſe themſelves in a morall, ingenious carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, this ought again and again to ſound in their ears, <hi>Unleſſe a man be born again, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> Now though this be ſo confeſſedly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſlary by Scripture grounds, yet who ſearcheth deeper into his heart, and who looketh further into his own ſoul, then a meer externall righteouſneſſe? if this were ſo, regeneration might be found in <hi>Aristotles</hi> and <hi>Plato's</hi> School, as well as Chriſts, but its the property of Gods word only to beget this new nature in us: Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour meaneth not, unleſſe a prophane man only be born again, but alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe a meer civill man, and outward vertuous man be born again, he cannot be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Neither are thoſe common gifts and graces which ſometimes are bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon reprobates, this regeneration: Judas</hi> was not born again though he had <note place="margin">5.</note> power to work miracles, and was inabled to preach the Goſpel of Chriſt. It is not with man as trees, every leaf and bloſſome argueth ſome life in the tree; but not in man, every ability to preach, to pray, though with great approbation, doth not manifeſt ſupernaturall life. Theſe indeed come from Chriſt inabling us and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, but not dwelling in us: ſuch as theſe are abortives or monſters, they are in a probable way of being born again, but prove unſhapen, ſometimes by defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency, ſometimes by redundancy, and ſometimes theſe have pains and pangs of heart, their ſouls are in travell, as if Chriſt would be formed in them, but at laſt there is nothing but winde and emptineſſe, the iſſue of them, ſo that if you conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:30767:117"/>
what this regeneration is not, you will finde excluded from this number, moſt of thoſe who yet externally account themſelves in Chriſts flock, and children in his houſe: do not therefore judge ſpirituall parts and head-abilities any ſuch great matter, for if theſe come not from a new heart within, if they are not ſtreams flowing from this fountain, they will vaniſh like vapours, and be but as the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands of flowers that were upon the beaſts that were near ſacrificing: Oh but how is this work of regeneration and gracious mercy of God now neglected? Who attendeth to it? Who in the midſt of theſe ſeverall opinions that fly abroad in the world, mindeth this neceſſary thing?</p>
                  <p>In the next place, let us conſider wherein this lyeth: and that in the generall we <note place="margin">Wherein rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration lieth.</note> may ſay is <hi>the reſtauration in ſome meaſure of that image of God, in which we were created: Adam</hi> was made after Gods image and likeneſſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. 27. holy as he was, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 24. called therefore the Son of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 3. 38. This conſiſted in an univerſall rectitude of the whole man, in an holy frame of all the parts, faculties, and affections in a man: now when <hi>Adam</hi> fell, this curious workmanſhip was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to pieces; no part, no affections could do their duty: grace therefore regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating is to reſtore and repair theſe breaches again: The blinded underſtanding is inlightned, The contumacious will obedient, The ſtony heart ſoftned, The unruly affections crucified, ſo that this grace of regeneration makes the moſt excellent alteration and wonderfull change that can be. It's far more then raiſing the bodies out of the grave, and making them incorruptible and glorious, and certainly if the people ſo wondred to ſee a lame cripple walk, a blinde man ſee, how ought we to admire the greatneſſe of Gods power in this ſupernaturall change? Now this Image of God had theſe remarkable things in it; There was an univerſall har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and proportion of all graces; for it is not the Image of a man if there be only the head or the hands, there muſt be the proportion of the whole body; ſo in this work of regeneration there muſt be an univerſall alteration: Every part muſt be born again, as well as every part is corrupted and every part ſhall be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. Then again in this Image there is likeneſſe and reſemblance, for ſo to be an image, is a relative thing, and therefore by this we are ſaid to be born of God, to be children of God, becauſe we have an heavenly diſpoſition, love what he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, delight in what he delighteth, hate what he hateth. Even as wicked men are ſaid to be of their Father the devil, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 44. becauſe they do his works, they lie, are malicious to the godly, reſiſt and oppoſe the means of grace, as Satan: Thus the godly are of God their Father, becauſe his works they do, are holy as he is, mercifull as he is, righteous as he is, though with a vaſt diſproportion. Laſtly, There was connaturallity and ſutableneſſe of this image with mans nature, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that Divines call that righteouſneſſe naturall, not in reſpect of the principles from whence it came, for ſo it was ſupernaturall, but the ſubject unto whom it was a due perfection, ſuppoſing Gods will to create man for the enjoying of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, even as his ſoul alſo may be ſaid to be due to him; Now although this rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration be to us ſupernaturall, and wholly of meer grace, yet when it is in fuſed, it makes ſuch a change that the waies of God are a delight to him, I delight in the Law of God in the inward man: There is a ſweet proportion between the heart that is made an holy ſubject, and the Law of God which is an holy ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
                  <p>But more particularly let us conſider the nature of it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>This new-birth makes grace to be in us by way of an infuſed life,</hi> and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall principle, fixed, and permanent; It giveth a man <hi>eſſe ſupernaturale,</hi> a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall <note place="margin">1.</note> being: Therefore is it called <hi>the hidden man, the inward man,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 4. <hi>The new creature, the divine nature.</hi> It's compared to a root, to a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to a foundation; and now for want of this, we ſee ſo much inconſtancy and unſetledneſſe in the matters of religion and piety. Men have not a new nature, they have only new notions, or new motions, not new natures. When grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes thus a rooted principle in us, then though the windes and ſtorms blow, a
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:30767:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
man will continue firm: <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerved ſome men had a diſpoſition to morall virtues, but not an habit, now this diſpoſition he made eaſily ſeparable from the ſubject, whereas the other made a man like a ſquare ſtone, which waies ſoever it falleth, it will ſtand ſure: You have ſome bruit creatures that act many things like men, but becauſe they have not an humane nature they are ſtill bruitiſh, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things may be done in the way of holineſſe, which yet come not from that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principle of renovation, and therefore is but copper and not gold: Oh let us not then conſider ſo much the outward actions, the outward duties of religion, as that root from whence they grow, that principle from whence they come, are they fixed, ſetled ones by way of life in thee? then art thou born of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>By this means a man doth participate of God;</hi> and whereas we cannot be like God in his greatneſſe, infiniteneſſe, omnipotency, we are like him in this, <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy:</hi> Lev. 11. 44. As therefore in God, the Angels, of all Gods attributes do eſpecially celebrate that, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy,</hi> Iſa. 6. 3. ſo of all conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in man this is his greateſt glory: it's not wealth but holineſſe, it's not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours but holineſſe, it's not prudence and wiſedom, but holineſſe. This new na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is a participation of God (ſo far as creatures can partake) in that glorious attribute of his: Magiſtrates they are called Gods, becauſe of that externall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority God hath ſtamped on them, and becauſe they reſemble him herein, but the people of God reſemble him in a more excellent and admirable way. The Apoſtle cals it bearing the image of the heavenly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 48. Hence come thoſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of ſetting our affections on things above, and ſitting with Chriſt in heavenly places. This is a wonderfull elevation and lifting up of the nature of man: As the humane nature of Chriſt was infinitely glorified to be hypoſtatically united unto the divine nature, ſo it is a great honour for man to be graciouſly united to Chriſt, whereby as the branch receiving juyce from the Vine, brings forth fruit ſuteable to the nature of the Vine, ſo the ſoul ingrafted into Chriſt produceth operations ſuteable thereunto.</p>

<pb n="206" facs="tcp:30767:118"/>
thee to be in the ſtate of bitterneſſe ſtill. There cannot from a ſweet fountain come only bitter ſtreams, ſo neither can there come from a refined ſpirit only cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted actions. As the thorn cannot ſend forth grapes, ſo neither do grapes ſend forth thorns; why then if thou art born of God, doſt thou diſcover ſo much of the old man in thee? why is the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> in <hi>Canaan?</hi> this is as the Father ſaid, for <hi>coelum pluere gehennam,</hi> in another caſe: did grace and Chriſt dwell in thy ſoul, were it poſſible that thy heart ſhould be a den of luſts, and a cage of unclean ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations? ſhake off therefore all negligence and lukewarmneſſe, obſerve how thou art changed, whether it be otherwiſe with thee then what thou haſt by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>As the actions of this new-born man are new, ſo are his deſires, comforts,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>contentments:</hi> Whereas before he could with the Prodigall be content with busks, now nothing will ſatisfie him but his fathers manſion, and his fathers feaſts. Take every naturall man, while unregenerated, as he knoweth no other good, ſo he deſireth no other then that of the creature, as Moles love the earth, and the Swine draught. Thus while we are corrupted in our eſtates, we minde only earthly things, but when this great change is made, then theſe coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelſhels are grown away; then the favour of God, the light of his countenance, ſociety with him, and enjoying of him, are the only deſires of his ſoul; Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> his heart, his fleſh, and all breathe after the living God, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 84. 2. Thou wilt not judge it ſuch an happy thing to be wealthy, great and honoured in the world, but to have the light of Gods favour ſhine round about thee. Examine therefore thy ſelf. Doſt thouſee the glory of the world, and thou falleſt down to worſhip it? Doſt thou in the encreaſe of worldly comforts ſay, <hi>It is good for us to be bare.</hi> Then fear thy ſelf, ſay, When I was a childe, it's no wonder, I thought, ſpake as a childe; but when a man, other apprehenſions came in: When thou waſt unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated thou ſpakeſt like a naturall man, thou thoughteſt like him, but now God hath made thee a ſpirituall man.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Being thus new born, he is carried out with afiliall affection in his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God:</hi> All his ſervice is ſweetned with a great deal of love, delight and joy. <note place="margin">6.</note> What he doth for God, he doth it not ſlaviſhly, ſervilely, as heretofore, enforced thereunto, but from an Evangelicall and kindely principle within. Thus thoſe that are new creatures are ſaid not to be under the <hi>Law,</hi> but under <hi>Grace.</hi> The Law is a rule to them, ſo they are under it, but the Law is not only a whip and a ſcourge to them, ſo that they ſhould pray; hear, do things out of conſtraint: yet this filiall confidence and love is alſo accompanyed with a reverentiall fear, and holy awe of God, ſo that from the one he is encouraged, from the other he walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth humbly. Now from this ſpirit of Adoption all our duties ſhould ariſe. Praier is but a bitter crab, or a wilde grape, unleſſe the Spirit of Adoption ſweeten it, and ſo of all other duties; if then we be born of God, his preſence, his favour is dear to us, our approaches unto the Throne of grace are with holy aſſurance, we call God <hi>Abba, Father,</hi> by ingemination, to ſhew partly the efficacy and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this ſpirit upon us, and partly the oppoſition that is made by the guilt and blackneſſe which is upon our own ſouls.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Where there is this new-birth, there a man is not only above ſin, to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew and hate that, but alſo above the world, and all immoderate affections thereunto,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">7.</note> 
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. it's called <hi>the life of God,</hi> not only becauſe he works it, but becauſe it imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates his life. Hence in the Scripture not only tranſgreſſions are made contrary to this life, but alſo the Love of father, mother, or any thing that is dear unto us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 37. ſo that it is a poor thing for a man thus regenerated to ſay, he loveth God more then ſin, more then the luſts of the fleſh; he doth alſo embrace him more then outward comforts in the world; Thou therefore who hopeſt thou art a childe of God, why is thy ſoul thus bowed down to the creatures? why art thou ſo diſparaging and debaſing that heavenly nature of thine? thou art not made a worm to crawl on the earth, not a ſerpent to lick the duſt of the ground, but
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:30767:118"/>
thou art made like unto God, to love what he loveth, to delight in what he delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in: Do not then labour after an impoſſibility, which is to ſerve God and Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to bring heaven and earth together. No if this new nature be infuſed into thee, it makes thee above trade, wealth, friends, honour, life; It filleth thy heart with ſuch heavenly inclinations, that as the ſtone cannot hang in the empty air, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteneth to its center, ſo the regenerated heart cannot abide in any thing on this ſide God; <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee, and whom on earth but thee?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eighthly, <hi>This birth is inexpreſſible:</hi> He that is thus born again, cannot declare <note place="margin">8.</note> how, ſo our Saviour afterwards, <hi>The spirit or winde bloweth where it liſteth, and thou knoweſt not whence it cometh, or whither it goeth.</hi> As a man underſtandeth not how fearfully and wonderfully he is made in his mothers womb; ſo neither how admirably God doth put theſe inclinations and diſpoſitions into his ſoul: How is it that he who was backward, yea, an enemy to what was good, yet now with all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light follows it? <hi>motum ſcimus, modum neſcimus,</hi> we finde theſe great changes made upon us, but cannot declare how: From this alſo it cometh about that we cannot expreſſe it to another, only experimentally feel it in our ſelves: As a man cannot expreſſe to another what it is to live, only he feels the motions of his life in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: Thus alſo he cannot tell to another what that new life, that new birth is, what that power of God is which he hath felt in his ſoul: but ſaith as the blinde man to the Phariſees concerning Chriſt, <hi>I know not how he made me whole, only this I know, I that was once blinde, do now ſee,</hi> Joh. 9. and ſo here, I know not how it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth about that I am thus altered, I cannot tell how I am changed, only this I know, I that was not afraid to ſinne, now I am; I that did not delight in God, now do.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, <hi>In that the Scripture cals this regeneration, a birth again,</hi> It's a meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phor, <note place="margin">9. A reſemblance between the naturall and ſpiritual birth. I.</note> and ſo would give us to conceive ſome reſemblance between the naturall and the ſpirituall birth, I ſhall touch upon ſome moſt evident.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Here is in this new birth God a Father,</hi> Therefore often ſaid <hi>to be born of God,</hi> and <hi>children of God.</hi> This as it denoteth our impotency, for if we cannot make our naturall ſelves much leſſe can we make our ſupernaturall ſelves; ſo it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo manifeſteth the great power and efficacy of Gods grace, which ſaith to us as unto dead <hi>Lazarus, Come forth</hi> out of the grave of ſin: Every godly man is an <hi>Iſaac,</hi> a childe of the promiſe, for he is born only by the meer power and grace of God: Mans free-will is <hi>Sarahs</hi> dead womb; It is <hi>Philo's</hi> allegory upon that of <hi>Jacob</hi> to <hi>Rachel,</hi> Am I a God (ſaith he) that I can give children? ſo ſaith he, God only puts grace and vertue into the womb of the ſoul; We may ſay to Pelagians and Arminians, Are we Gods that we can raiſe the dead, give life where there is none? This is good to be obſerved, for there is ſcarce any doctrine more pernicious to the glory of God then this, whereby we ſhall be Creators of the new creatures. We cannot make a fly, and yet we think we can make our ſelves godly. Oh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore look up to heaven, and ſay, O Lord new make me, new create me.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The ſeed or means by which this new-birth is accompliſhed, is the Word</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">II.</note> 
                     <hi>of God preached:</hi> Thus often, he hath begotten by his word, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 18. and it is that whereby we are quickned; Take all humane eloquence, all Philoſophicall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, they do no more then the Prophets ſervant to the dead childe, though laid upon him, yet it would not bring life into him, his maſter muſt come ere there can be life. Alas, to inſtruct men with arguments from reaſon about a good life, ſuch as the heathens are very buſie to perſwade men by; they turn not, or alter the heart. The Word of God is that two-edged ſword, is that fire, that hammer, that ſeed, that Manna, which ſerveth to ſubdue ſin, and to quicken up to grace. Oh therefore how carefull ſhould people be both to get and to live under the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods Word! This is the winde that muſt make dry bones live: This is the voice of a trump, that muſt make the dead come out of the grave. How mean, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, contemptible, men may eſteem it, yet God hath appointed no other means to convey ſupernaturall life, but after this manner. Therefore where no viſion is,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:30767:119"/>
the people periſh, where no preaching is there cannot but be a worſe judgement then that of <hi>Egypt,</hi> where there was one dead in every family; Alas there all muſt needs be dead in every family. This new life comes by preaching.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>As the naturall birth is with many pangs and troubles; In ſorrow they</hi>

                     <hi>ſhall bring forth,</hi> Thus alſo is this new man wrought in us with much agony and trouble, many a heart-ach, many a violent trouble of ſoul, ere Chriſt be formed in us. Hence as when Chriſt was born all <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was troubled, ſo when this new life is infuſed into a man, much commotion, much diviſion of heart. The devil when he was caſt out of the poſſeſſed perſon, did more tear, torment, and vex the poſſeſſed perſon, when he was going out: ſo grace expelling Satan from thoſe holds and dominions he had over thee, puts thee to great fears, raiſeth more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in the heart. Beſides that Chriſt and the way of grace may be the more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and precious, Gods ſpirit is for a while a ſpirit of bondage, to make every thing a burden, ſin a burden, our lives a burden, our ſhops burdens, our fields bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, that ſo there may be the greater joy for this manchilde that is born. A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man cannot bring forth in her ſleep, or in a dream, without feeling pain, ſo neither can the heart of a man be thus new changed, and molded without ſeverall pangs, yet we do not limit this to ſuch degrees, nor to every perſon in ſuch a ſenſible manner.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>As this naturall life at firſt infuſed is the root of all vitall actions,</hi> and <note place="margin">IV.</note> if any thing proceed not from this, it is dead; ſo this ſupernatural life is the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all vital actions in grace, and whatſoever is not from this root, cannot be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a living action. If a man prayeth, if he heareth, and this not flow from the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of regeneration, it is not accounted in the number of ſpiritual actions. When therefore thou ſetteſt upon the exerciſe of religious duties, ſtill conſider from what life this proceedeth; for thy hearing, thy praying, thy family duties may come from education, cuſtom, formal devotion, but not from this divine life. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is the only neceſſary thing, if thou haſt lived to threeſcore years, and this new principle not infuſed into thee, thou haſt not yet done one acceptable duty. As the Apoſtle ſpeaks of a dead faith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 26. ſo there are dead duties, dead per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, and our auditory may moſt conſiſt of dead men. You ſee Clocks and other artificial inſtruments have their motions, but they are not motions of life, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not from a principle of life within, and on ſuch motions may all the religious exerciſe of thy ſoul be; and hereby men perform holy duties, as <hi>Caiaphas</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied, not knowing what he ſaid. So that regeneration in holy duties is like the ſoul in the body, which giveth life and acceptance, and all to it.</p>
                  <p>Now there are two obſtructions which hinder men both from the knowledge of <note place="margin">Obſtructions hindring men from the knowledge of the neceſſity of this, and deſire after it. 1.</note> the neceſſity of this, and an earneſt deſire to obtain it.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, <hi>Ignorance of that wofull depravation and defilement which is upon us through ſin.</hi> As long as men know not themſelves to be beggers, they will never cry out, <hi>unclean, unclean.</hi> As long as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> knoweth not that he is altogether fleſh and in his ſins, the whole doctrine of regeneration is a myſtery. Men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that would be edified into this high building, muſt begin with this deep and low foundation. He that doth not groan and ſigh under all thoſe ſoars and ulcers that are upon him by nature, will never ſeek after this glorious change. Therefore thou that buildeſt duty upon duty, exerciſe upon exerciſe, and haſt not firſt begun here, though thy building be as glorious as that of the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was, yet the time will come, when a ſtone will not be left upon a ſtone: And it is much to be feared that generally people are in a wrong way to heaven; they think the fleſh and bloud they were born in will bring them to heaven, and therefore, when you may hear many talk of repentance, of ſerving of God, of amendment of our lives, yet not one among many ſpeaks of regeneration, and the neceſſity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the firſt riſe of this calamity is becauſe they are ignorant of Originall ſinne.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond obſtruction is, <hi>A ſelf-fulneſs, an heart puffed up with humane excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>

which indeed are but as the graſſe and the flower of the field; for ſo <hi>Peter</hi> having ſpoken of this incorruptible nature we attain unto, he maketh it more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent than any humane power, prudence or righteouſneſſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 24. becauſe all this fadeth, but the Word of God which begets this new nature abideth for ever; and therefore of all the things in the world, which <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Becauſe ſome of them are buſied with high and ſublime Diſputations, ſome in the externall Rites and Ceremonies of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and theſe puffing up the heart in a fleſhly manner, they are no fit Diſciples to receive this great Truth about Regeneration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Is there ſuch a neceſſity of Regeneration, then let young men and old <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> men, rich men and poor, prophane and civill, have their eares tingle, or rather their hearts wounded at this: It may be thou art an old man ready to fall in the Grave, and art not thou acquainted with this new Birth? It may be thou art a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor and Maſter in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and art thou not convinced of this? Oh blind ſouls, how near are you deſtruction, and you are not aware of it! Thou canſt in time of ſickneſſe, in fears of death, to thy prayers, to thy tears, to the Sacrament it may be; thou calleſt for a good Book to be read to thee, a good Miniſter to come to thee, but ah Miſerable ſoul, all the work is ſtill to doe within; ſay once therefore this Text unto thy ſoul, <hi>Unleſſe I be born again I cannot enter into heaven.</hi> Born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, O Lord what is that! Was ever ſuch a thing done upon me! Oh I fear the contrary; if I were born of God, I could not grovell thus on the earth, I could not wallow thus in filth. You Parents, you labour to have your Children born to great Eſtates, to large Revenues; oh, but how ſhall theſe Children of yours curſe the wombe that bare them, and the breaſts that gave them ſuck, if they have not their new Birth?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. Is the Word preached thus the means of this new Birth; then let us <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> lament the miſcarriage of the Miniſtery in theſe latter days. Who are born again by it? What hath God no more people to be ſaved in <hi>England?</hi> hath God no more in <hi>London</hi> to come to eternal life, that no more are by the Word begotten anew? Few Miniſters can ſay with <hi>Iſaiah, Behold I and the Children whom the Lord hath given me;</hi> few People can ſay, <hi>You are our Fathers who have begotten us in the Lord;</hi> you may ſay, <hi>We have many Inſtructors, but few Fathers,</hi> as the Apoſtle in another caſe.</p>
                  <p>This is the reproach and grief of the Miniſtry, but it's no Argument (as ſome would inforce) of the nulli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

This is the great end of the Miniſtry, and as the Sun ſhineth in vain to blind men, the Clouds drop in vain upon hard rocks, ſo is the Word preached in vain, and people hear in vain, where this great alteration followeth not: The prophaneneſs, ignorance and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall unſavourineſs in mens ſpirits, do ſufficiently proclaime to all the world, that the Lord hath given us dry breaſts, and miſcarrying wombs.</p>

                  <p>WE have already defined the nature of Regeneration, and before we come to the diſcovery of the counterfeits thereof, there are other obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable things in this colloquie with <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> that ſhould not be preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted: I ſhall therefore in the next place, diſcourſe of the ignorance and ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of <hi>Nicodemus</hi> about this great work of God, which our Saviour with much ſeverity doth reprove him for in my Text. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> doth ſeveral times manifeſt his groſſe blindneſſe in this point, while he diſcourſeth with our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He underſtands our Saviour of a natural birth again, by going the ſecond time into the mothers womb; our Saviour therefore confirmeth his aſſertion the ſecond time, and withall explicates the ground of this regeneration, becauſe all are naturally corrupted, yet for all this, <hi>Nicodemus</hi> marvelleth at it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Our Saviour doth by a familiar example from the wind, ſhew the work of regeneration, and for all this, <hi>Nicodemus</hi> is not ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>But a Third time, <hi>verſe</hi> 9. he cryeth out, <hi>How can theſe things be?</hi> Whereupon our Saviour upbraideth him with his ignorance, not by way of contumelious inſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but to humble this Phariſes, who being puft up with the opinion of his learning and righteouſneſſe, could not at all diſcern of this grace: now our Saviours reprehenſion is very emphatical, <hi>Art thou a Maſter?</hi> not a Diſciple, not one of the vulgar ſort, but a Maſter? And as ſome conſider the Article, Art thou the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter? Or that Maſter? As if this <hi>Nicodemus</hi> among all the Teachers in Iſrael had the greateſt repute: Then, Art thou a Maſter of Iſrael? A people that were eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called by God, and taught by him; the moſt knowing people of the world in reſpect of Gods Law? Further, a Maſter of Iſrael; all Iſrael was his ſcholar: not a Maſter of ſome Diſciple, but of Iſrael: And laſtly, knoweſt not theſe things. He doth not ſay, Not practice it, not feel the power of it on thy own heart: but thou haſt not ſo much as the bare hiſtorical knowledge of it: So that this ſpeech of our Saviours is a ſad rebuke, and reproach to all the carnal wiſedom, and ſelf-righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men, which is like the Bat or Owl to the Sun, when it cometh to theſe ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things. I have obſerved that men in diſcourſe, will meerly apply this to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary matters: Art thou a Maſter in Iſrael, and knoweſt not theſe things? They will ſay ſo of any news, or cuſtoms diſcourſed of: but the truth is, this Text ſhould be matter of fear and trembling; for it doth diſcover the horrible oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and enmity that is in men, to any heavenly work of God; As your bats and owls can ſee well enough in the night but not in the day, ſo natural men have parts, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:30767:120"/>
wiſedom, quick apprehenſions in the things of darkneſs, matters of ſin, and the world; but in the things of God, they are ſtark blinde: therefore ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. <hi>If I tell you earthly things, and ye believe not, how ſhall ye believe if I tell you of heavenly?</hi> The ſenſe is, If when I ſpeak of regeneration by earthly ſimilitudes, and expreſſions obvious to the ſenſe, you are not able to apprehend them, How then if I ſhould ſpeak to you of heavenly things, in an heavenly manner, without ſuch ſenſible repreſentations at all?</p>
                  <p>Obſervation, <hi>That men of great Learning, and outward Righteouſneſſe</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Before we lay down the grounds of this ignorance in every natural man, we may take notice of ſome particulars, as Introductory to the point: as,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That it is a moſt requiſite, yea, neceſſary thing for every Miniſter that is to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Introducto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particulars. A Miniſter ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this Doctrine.</note> 
                     <hi>be a Teacher, and guid of others, to underſtand well, and be inwardly acquainted with this Doctrine of a new birth.</hi> When our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Art thou a Teacher, a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the people, and knoweſt not theſe things?</hi> he ſuppoſeth it was a great ſhame and reproach to him: And indeed, ſeeing the one principal end of the Miniſtry is to beget men anew unto God, how can he be skilful in that office, which is wholly unacquainted with the end of it? It is true, that opinion of the <hi>Donatiſts: That an ungodly Miniſter is never uſed inſtrumentally to the regeneration of others,</hi> is reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted as falſe. <hi>Judas,</hi> and thoſe who preached Chriſt out of envy, might be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to bring others to Chriſt, elſe <hi>Paul</hi> would not <hi>have rejoyced in it,</hi> Phil. 1. 19. although this it may be is very rare; and as God in the Old Teſtament would have no Miniſter with any bodily deformity, ſo in the New, without any ſoul-defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; he muſt be unblameable: we do not therefore diſpute of the poſſibility, but it is very rare for dead men, to beget living men; for miniſters unexperienced in the life of grace, to revive others: although this be ſo, yet it is the auditors duty, as our Savior informeth about the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>To hear them as long as they ſit in Moſes chair;</hi> but not to do what they do: for a man to neglect good doctrin, becauſe of the bad practice of the teacher, is as Auſtin wel ſaith, <hi>as if a traveller that ſeeth the poſt in the high way, that hath an hand to direct him on his journey, ſhould not go forward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the poſt that directeth him doth not go forward.</hi> But though theſe things are ſo; yet it is a wonderful uncomfortable and deading thing to live under that preaching, which is not diſcovering of a work of regeneration within: when a Miniſter ſpeaks of this great work, as ſome bragging men of the remoreſt part of the world, which he hath onely by hear-ſay, or by books, not by experience in his travels. The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter muſt ſpeak from the heart, elſe he cannot ſpeak to the heart; as they could not give any account of the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, which had not ſo much as heard whether there was an holy Ghoſt or no; ſo thoſe Miniſters are never able to give direction, conſolation to the Godly in their temptations about this, that know not the power of it in their own hearts. The Scripture calls it, <hi>The tongue of the learned,</hi> to be able to ſpeak <hi>a word in ſeaſon, to the broken and contrite in heart,</hi> Iſa. 50. 4. This is neceſſary learning, more then all humane knowledge, though that alſo be requiſite.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>There is a twofold knowledge of regeneration, the one is meerly specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. A twofold knowledge of regeneration.</note> 
                     <hi>and Theoreticall, the other is Practical and Experimental.</hi> A Speculative knowledge, is when a man is convinced in judgement by ſeveral arguments and reaſons, that there is a neceſſity of regeneration; but this knowledge is not like <hi>Aarons</hi> oyl, that deſcends from the head to other parts, but it onely lodgeth in the brain: Now <hi>Nicodemus</hi> had not ſo much as this ſpeculative knowledge, he had not ſo much as an hiſtorical aſſent with his minde, of the neceſſity of ſuch a ſpiritual change; whereas it was a great wonder, that he who had read thoſe promiſes of the taking away <hi>the heart of ſtone,</hi> and giving <hi>an heart of fleſh, of creating a new heart in,</hi> &amp;c. could not eaſily be convinced in this. But <hi>Nicodemus</hi> doth not onely que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:30767:121"/>
the neceſſity of it, but the poſſibility alſo of it: he doth not only think there is no ſuch thing, but there can be no ſuch thing: whereas, he that knew God breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a natural life into <hi>Adam,</hi> when a lump of earth, might eaſily believe God able to infuſe a ſupernatural life: beſides the Sacrament of Circumciſion, and that legall cuſtome of Purification of Women, did teach as Original pollution, ſo a neceſſity of cleanſing and waſhing. But beſides this ſpeculative, there is alſo a practical knowledge, when a man findeth the ſweet and lively power of this upon his own heart. You have many a learned man that is very orthodox in his judgement, who by conſidering the reaſons and diſputes on all ſides, is convinced of a neceſſity of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, and hereby he can preach for it, write for, and diſpute for it: but yet this man doth no more, then as he that ſhould ſay hony is ſweet, when he never taſted of it: And ſo as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaw the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but never entered into it, ſo theſe diſcern afar off this work of grace, but are never poſſeſſors of it: when there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore both theſe kinds of knowledge concur together, ſpeculative and experimental, when he can feel it in heart, as well as read it in books, this makes a man a fit teacher to others.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>As this knowledge is requiſite in the Doctor, ſo alſo in the Diſciple, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>the choiceſt and chiefeſt matter in all religion, is preached in vain.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He had rather speak five words with underſtanding, then five hundred in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known tongue:</hi> and it is the Miniſters deſire to ſpeak a little of thoſe Myſteries of Grace to men that can go along with them, then much to thoſe that underſtand no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. Had not our Saviour been meek and humble, he would not have born the indocibleneſſe of <hi>Nicodemus:</hi> The Apoſtle complaineth <hi>he could not ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Corinthians as spiritual, but as carnal,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 1. To preach to dead men, to throw pearls to ſwine, how unſutable is it? There are many Auditors, that if you preach about controverſal matter, or the times, or any moral matter, they are quick and intelligent; but if you explain, and inſiſt upon this work of rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, there they loſe you. As they themſelves never felt the power of it, ſo they do not at all attend to the Doctrine of it: <hi>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear;</hi> no man hath an hearing ear, or a ſeeing eye, or an underſtanding heart, till this ſupernatural life be infuſed.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being laid down, we proceed to ſhew the grounds of this ignorance, <note place="margin">The grounds of this igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</note> and groſſe miſtake in matters of Godlineſſe: and</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>They do not underſtand it, becauſe they are ignorant of that univerſal and deep pollution, which ſin hath plunged them into.</hi> Hence was the ground of <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> his miſtake: therefore our Saviour diſcovers the foundation when he ſaith, <hi>That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh.</hi> As <hi>Nicodemus</hi> was thus ignorant, ſo <hi>Paul</hi> alſo was as much out of the way: for he was a long time er'e he was perſwaded of that inward latent venom that was in him, and thereupon muſt needs ſee no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a new birth. Wouldeſt thou therefore come to have thy eyes opened? Thy heart awakened ſo, as to prize an inward Renovation, or a new change of thy heart? ſtudy more, meditate more upon that Native uncleanneſſe; Say, How can this fleſh and blood inherit heaven? How can this uncleanneſſe put on glory? Is there any ſutableneſſe between thy depraved heart, and eternal happineſſe in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Can that minde of thine think glorious things of God? Can that heart of thine rejoyce in the goodneſſe of God? If not, then ſay, <hi>O Lord, make me all new.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And certainly, if the Apoſtle to thoſe whom he ſuppoſeth regenerated, ſaith, <hi>Put off the old man, and put on the new, becauſe of thoſe reliques and remainders of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are within us,</hi> Epheſ. 4. how much rather is this to be preſſed upon thoſe wholly wallowing in their natural blood: <hi>Put off the old man,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: Auſtin makes it an alluſion to the ſnake that puts off her old skin; but that is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, the inward poyſonous nature, as well as the skin muſt be put off. Marvel not therefore if ye ſee men no more ſollicitous about this new birth, if their hearts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and earneſt prayers are no more after it; for as long as men are blinde in this
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:30767:121"/>
point, <hi>viz.</hi> Original ſin, they will alſo be blinde to the other, <hi>viz.</hi> Regeneration. Upon this account it is, that of all men, moral men, civil vertuous men, are very remote from, yea oppoſite unto this great change: For they of all men are leaſt affected with their blots, and ſpotted nature: they having no actuall groſſe ſins to humble themſelves, do not ſee that heart-filthineſſe, and ſoul deformity which is upon them. Oh, therefore intreat God to give the ſpirit of illumination to ſee thy ſelf, that the hidden corners of darkneſſe within thee, may be manifeſted unto thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Second ground of this groſs blindeneſs, is ſelf-righteouſneſs and ſelf-fulneſs. Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> was puffed up with that external legal righteouſneſſe, which he conſtantly performed, and therefore thought nothing more was requiſite to him. Thus the Phariſees being full of their praiers, alms-deeds, and religious faſts, ſetled their hopes upon theſe; and therefore our Saviour preacheth very ſutable, though ſtrange Doctrine, when he bids them make all clean within, <hi>and the tree muſt be good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fruit be good:</hi> What is that but to ſay, their perſons muſt be regenerated, before they can do any holy action? This ſelf-fulneſſe doth not onely croſſe the grace of juſtification, as the <hi>Jews,</hi> who would eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs, <hi>ſubmitted not to the righteouſneſs of Chriſt;</hi> but alſo <hi>the grace of regeneration;</hi> for that which is accounted already whole, already ſound, what need it go to the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian to be healed? Thus <hi>Laodicea</hi> becauſe ſhe thought her ſelf <hi>rich, full, and lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of nothing, therefore ſhe was the more miſerable and wretched,</hi> Rev. 3. 15. The heart affected with ſelf-love, and ſelf-righteouſneſſe, promiſeth nothing but mercy, and happineſſe to it ſelf, will not endure to be found a ſinner, or to have iniquity diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; now this ſelf-righteouſneſs is that, which beareth up the heart of every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man, otherwiſe it were impoſſible that under the ſpiritual diſcovery of all his filth and poverty, he ſhould ever be able to ſit ſtill, to eat, or ſleep becauſe of the wrath of God compaſſing him round about. Take therefore away this rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh, and then a good building may quickly be reared; otherwiſe here is <hi>Laeſum principium,</hi> the very principles of a man are corrupted; and what good can we then expect? Chriſt caſt out <hi>all the Timbrels, and Muſitians, er'e he would raiſe the dead;</hi> and thus muſt all thy carnal hopes and carnal joyes in thy ſelf-righteouſneſs, or in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Creature be thrown out, er'e he will raiſe thee from this ſpiritual death. Oh do not then be prejudiced againſt this truth, by thinking in thy heart, If I yeild my ſelf to be thus a ſinner, if I abhor, and throw away all my righteouſneſs, I ſhall then deſpair, I ſhall be like one in the ſea, without the leaſt plank or board to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve my ſelf: Do not fear this, for thou muſt feel thy ſelf dead, er'e thou beeſt made alive; thou muſt look on thy ſelf as undone, before thou canſt be ſaved. Is not the veſſel broken into pieces and melted, er'e it can be new moulded? Muſt not the old houſe be pulled down, er'e the new one be raiſed up? As the Apoſtle ſaith, In matter of reſurrection, <hi>we are loth to put off this corruptible body;</hi> we would fain be clothed upon; we would have heaven without dying; ſo we would be new born without pangs or ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Another ground of ignorance in the work of regeneration, is not attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſpiritual exactneſs and obligation of the law; for that doth not onely require</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>us to do thoſe things that are good, but to do them from ſuch an inward principle of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitude, and a divine original, that our hearts and affections may be holy therein, as well as our converſation.</hi> Therefore the heart if good, <hi>is called the good treaſure, out of which all good things are to proceed:</hi> God is not holy only in his providence, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward adminiſtrations, but in his nature alſo: As when any ſin is forbidden in the commandement, the root and cauſe of it is much more forbidden; ſo where an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duty is required, the root and cauſe of it is much more commanded; God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore commands thee to love him; but how? from a renewed heart; to be ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for ſin; but how? from a changed heart; to pray, to hear, but ſtill from a regenerated heart. Now men do not attend to this; the law is ſpiritual, it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the root, as well as the branch, it looks more then to good fruit, it will alſo
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:30767:122"/>
have a good tree. Oh if men did drive the matter to this head, happily they would cry out, <hi>Ous, hitherto in a wrong way?</hi> We muſt begin all again; we have prayed in vain, heard in vain, profeſſed in vain: we wanted a true foundation; we did not dig deep enough, and therefore our houſe will fall. You have <hi>Paul</hi> excellently diſcourſing upon this matter, experimentally in himſelf; and what wonderfull al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations he then found, when once he began to underſtand the ſpiritual latitude of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Therefore do not men believe this, becauſe they do not underſtand the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>true nature of the Sacrament of Baptiſm, which if rightly underſtood, would make e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man ſee the neceſſity of regeneration.</hi> If the Phariſees had known the end and uſe of the Sacrament of Circumciſion, that would have led them into the knowledge of their natural defilement, and the neceſſity of cutting it off. Hence God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <hi>to circumciſe their hearts,</hi> Deut. 30. 6. and circumciſion was properly that of the ſpirit in the inward man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. But the Jews they reſted wholly upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſign, and never regarded the thing ſignified. Now Baptiſm in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, doth alſo proclaim the neceſſity of this new birth, called therefore <hi>the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of regeneration, Tit.</hi> 3. 5. as ſome expound it. And although it be much diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, whether that expreſſion of our Saviour to <hi>Nicodemus, Unleſs a man be born of the water and the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven,</hi> be meant of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and the outward element in that Ordinance: yet the very water which is commanded to be uſed by us in that adminiſtration, doth evidently ſignifie the pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of our natures, and ſo a neceſſity of waſhing: For children that have no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual ſins are waſhed, becauſe they have Original filthineſſe, ſo that regeneration is neceſſary to a young infant. Who art thou, that becauſe thou keepeſt free from groſs ſins, abſtaineſt from the evils of the world, and therefore ſeeſt not ſuch a neceſſity of regeneration? For if thou wert as clean as the infant new born, If thou hadſt no more ſins then that hath; Yet this ſpirit of regeneration muſt new mould thee, er'e thou canſt be a polliſhed ſtone in that heavenly Jeruſalem? But as it was with the Jews, ſo it is with us Chriſtians: we rely on Baptiſm, reſt on the Sacrament adminiſtred, never conſidering whether we are made partakers of that inward na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-waſhing or not.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Therefore men are ſtupid about this doctrine, becauſe they conſider not</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>Gods gracious promiſe which is made for this great work.</hi> Doth not the Prophet <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſpeak often of giving <hi>a new heart,</hi> of <hi>writing his law in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward parts: Ezek. 18. Jer.</hi> 31? And do not other Scriptures ſpeak of circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their hearts, and turning their hearts? It was therefore much that <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> who no doubt had read thoſe places over and over again, did yet no better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it. But do not men ſo ſtill? Read thoſe Chapters, yea, hear ſermons that are made on purpoſe about it, and for all this go away, not knowing what it meaneth? Gods Evangelical promiſe is not to give new eyes, or new hands onely, but a new heart alſo: and truely herein is the omnipotency of Gods grace ſeen, that it reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the ſpirits of men. It makes them know, will, love, and delight in thoſe things which their hearts were oppoſite unto; and hence muſt we fetch our ground to wreſtle with God in prayer for it. O Lord, is it not thy promiſe to give a new heart? haſt thou not ſaid, <hi>Thou wilt take away this heart of ſtone?</hi> Now, O Lord, my heart is too ſtrong for me, I do but waſh a Blackamore, that makes him black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; by all my endeavour and natural ſtrength, the more I ſtrive, the faſter I ſtick in this pit of ſin: O therefore this promiſe of thine I own, I look to have it fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: O Lord, it reacheth to my life, to make that clean, my converſation, to make that unſpotted; but Oh, let it reach to the inward parts, to make them pure.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Another ground of mens ignorance is corrupt errors in the judgement, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that many mens profeſſed Doctrines and tenets, which they held, do expreſly</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>deſtroy the truth of regeneration.</hi> As thoſe opinions which deny Original ſin; for if there be no ſuch inward depravation, then there needeth no ſuch inward renova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:30767:122"/>
Thus alſo thoſe that extol the power of free-will by nature, they muſt thus far at leaſt deny any regeneration, or healing power of Grace upon the will: yea, all opinions of Popery, Socinianiſm, Arminianiſm, do either in whole, or part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy this new creature: for ſo far as a man hath power to prevent Gods grace, or determine it, ſo far it works by an innate power, and virtue of its own: Thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo thoſe that hold grace onely for the more eaſie doing of that which is good, or that compare a man in his regeneration to a captive priſoner, that cannot walk becauſe of fetters and clogs upon him: but let them be loſed, then he is able to walk by his own inward power; but ſuch a man in that caſe is improperly ſaid to be born again. Take heed therefore of thoſe corrupt opinions about Original ſin, and free-will, for theſe make regeneration not neceſſary; and men blinded in their judgements with ſuch doctrines, can never pant and breath after that great work upon their own ſouls.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>The buſying of mens ſelves about ſuperſtitious invented worſhip by men, doth alſo make a man altogether ignorant, or not attentive to this.</hi> We may ſay <note place="margin">7.</note> to Monks, Fryars, Superſtitious perſons, Are you, or would you be accounted <hi>Maſter</hi> in Iſrael, and know nothing of this? look on all the popiſh devotional books, their heaps of external ceremonies, and in all theſe things, not a word or manifeſtation of any regeneration. Thus it was alſo with the Jews, and with the Phariſees; they placed all religion in external addreſſes to God, but never acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves with the knowledge of the inward efficacious work of grace. The heart of a man is finite; it is not a ſpring that can fill two channels; if therefore all the intention of it run out upon invented worſhip, it neglecteth what is more neceſſary. Hence it is that none are greater enemies and ſcorners of this work of God, then thoſe that are moſt pertinacious in traditional worſhip. He that is buſie where he ſhould not, is alwaies negligent where he ought not to be: who hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired theſe things at your hands? ſaith Chriſt; but where things were required, there they did nothing at all.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, <hi>Therefore are men ignorant of this doctrine, becauſe they ſet themſelves</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">8.</note> 
                     <hi>to know unprofitable things, ſooner then profitable.</hi> It is a great corruption in our underſtanding, that we ſeek to finde out thoſe things that do not advantage us, or benefit us; but the things of uſe and edification, thoſe are laid aſide. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle blamed this in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> therefore he ſheweth, <hi>That knowledge puffeth up:</hi> and he that is proud about his knowledge, he knoweth nothing as he ought to know: Oh, what an unhappy inſtance are our daies of this wilde immature knowledge? How many diſputes about this and the other controverſie? Into what parties and ſects are we divided by the pride of knowledge? Whereas now if we did deſire to ſtudy, diſcourſe, confer, and meditate one thoſe things that tend to regeneration, to mortification, to make us new creatures, this would be to ſome purpoſe: You ſee the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> mattered not Jew or Gentile, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion or uncircumciſion, but a new creature, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 1. Thus ſhould we be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: lead not me into labyrinths of diſputes; elevate not my underſtanding with ſublimated notions, but inſtruct me how to be a new creature: what will Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical knowledge avail to underſtand the nature of hearbs, and plants, when thou knoweſt not this divine nature? What will skill in Phyſick advantage thee, to be able to make ſound bodies, and recover out of mortal diſeaſes, if thy ſoul be not healed of its diſeaſes? What to underſtand the law of man, and to direct about Purchaſes, and Evidences, and Aſſurances of Eſtates, but knoweſt no aſſurance of a ſpiritual eſtate? Yea, in Divinity points, to diſpute about predeſtination, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Grace, Church Government, and all the controverſies of the times, when thou knoweſt not this Doctrine of regeneration? <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaid, <hi>He loved not to read Tully, or any humane Author, becauſe he did not finde the name of Jeſus there:</hi> So do not thou love thoſe diſputes, thoſe controverſies, thoſe books, where there is not ſomething to minde thee of regeneration: this is to be ſought in the firſt place.</p>

Thus hypocriſie, that begineth to change in outward actions firſt; but true grace, that begineth at the heart and vitals firſt: give me a man regenerated, and he is a man of ſome ſubſtance, ſome foundation, you know where to have him; but a man of meer parts, abilities, and notional fancies, yea, or fervent duties without this foundation, he is but a bubble and a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por. He is toſſed up and down like a ſtraw with the wind, whereas if he had weight, and ſolidity in him, he would ſtand like a rock. Oh therefore know, it is a wiſe mans courſe to look to firſt principles, to be diligent about what foundations he layeth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Where there is this experimental knowledge of regeneration, there is an</hi>

                     <hi>endeavour to beget others like them.</hi> As God bid every creature encreaſe in its kinde, ſo do theſe new born children of God deſire to multiply. When they were once regenerated then Oh that my Parents were, Oh that my children were, Oh that my kindred, Oh that all under my charge were! It is much to conſider what great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth even about ſome women, calling them <hi>Follow-labourers, and great promoters of the Gospel:</hi> Why is all this? But that ſpiritual life in them makes them fervent to bring home others. <hi>Come and ſee,</hi> ſaith <hi>Andrew</hi> to <hi>Philip:</hi> And what an high expreſſion hath <hi>Paul</hi> concerning the ſalvation of his kinsfolks after the fleſh: and if in publick relation as Miniſters, as Maſters, as Fathers, Oh how are their bowels ſtraitned within them, how grieved and broken where they ſee God doth not give ſuch a ſupernatural life! Whereas now, a man meerly civil, he deſireth his children may be civil men, no Prodigals; but to deſire them to be godly and holy, that he is far from.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Where this experimental knowledge is of regeneration, there is a great</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>ſympathy and agreement between others that are regenerated.</hi> As face anſwereth face, ſo doth the heart of one regenerated man to another. The ſame temptations, the ſame conſolations, the ſame operations, they dwell in one anothers hearts: and where this new life is moſt active and efficacious, there they bend their greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and love. But now take a man that knoweth of regeneration by the book, by hear-ſay; though he may plead for it in the general, yet the particular practice he cannot abide: A miniſter may preach to a people to get this new birth, and yet ſcoff and oppoſe thoſe that have it, and all this is for want of experimental power of it upon the ſoul: but we have already ſpoken in the general to theſe things heretofore. Let this ſuffice to quicken us up to the right underſtanding of this myſtery, be not in the number of thoſe to whom this work is a riddle.

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>WE have already obſerved the nature of Regeneration out of this famous Dialogue, as alſo the ignorance and miſtake that the wiſeſt have about it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the third thing obſervable in this Hiſtory, is the ground and reaſon of the neceſſity of this new Birth, and that is contained in my Text. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> he dreamed of a carnall Birth a ſecond time, whereas if he had been born an hundred times this way, it would not have advantaged him, yea he would have been an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times thereby the child of wrath: Our Saviour therefore would inſtruct <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>codemus</hi> by opening the fountain, and diſcovering the root of this neceſſity; as if he had ſaid, The reaſon why thou art ſo groſly ignorant in this matter (O <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus)</hi> is, becauſe thou knoweſt not what corruption doth cleave to every man, how contrary this is to the Kingdome of Heaven; if thou wert rectified in this, thou wouldſt quickly ſee the neceſſity of the other. Know therefore, <hi>That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is born of the fleſh, is fleſh,</hi> and ſo not capable of everlaſting glory.</p>
                  <p>The words then are a Propoſition containing a Reaſon, why there muſt be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation before there can be any entrance into the Kingdome of Heaven; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you have the ſubject deſcribed, <hi>That which is born of the fleſh. Fleſh</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſed in Scripture for the bodily part of a man, as corruptible, in which ſenſe it is ſaid, <hi>All fleſh is graſſe;</hi> ſometime it is uſed for man as he is ſinfull and unregenerate, <hi>In my fleſh dwelleth no good thing,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul.</hi> The firſt ſenſe denoteth our fragility and meaneneſs, the ſecond our guilt and ſinfulneſſe; both aggravate our miſery and baſeneſſe; and this expreſſion is univerſall, <hi>That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh.</hi> This extendeth to wiſe men, to great men, noble men, Kings and Emperors; they are fleſh of fleſh. Secondly, there is the predicate, <hi>Is fleſh.</hi> The expreſſion is in the abſtract, to ſhew, how totally, deeply and univerſally he is fleſhly. Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. calls <hi>being in the fleſh,</hi> as ſurrounded and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about with it.</p>
                  <p>So that our Saviours reaſon lyeth in this, Every thing expreſſeth the nature of that kind in which it is, That which comes of a Wolf hath a Wolviſh nature, that which comes of a Sheep hath a Sheepiſh nature, and that which comes of a corrupt unclean kind muſt alſo be unclean: So that our Saviours expreſſion is like

that of <hi>Jobs, Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?</hi> Lambs come not from Bears, nor Figs from Thorns.</p>

                  <p>Men never apply themſelves to more than Morality and Civility, till they are perſwaded that the greateſt part of their vileneſſe and loathſomneſſe lyeth in their inward parts. We are moſt ſinfull and deformed there where the naturall eye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth nothing at all: Men never provide a plaiſter any further than they think the wound reacheth; now if men perceive no wound in the inward frame of their heart, they never look at any change there.</p>
                  <p>In the opening of this point, let us conſider the nature of this originall defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <note place="margin">The nature of original defile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</note> and ſo the work of Regeneration anſwerably thereunto: for whereas in ſin there are two things, the guilt of it, and the filth of it; There is a two-fold grace anſwering this, The grace of juſtification, which blots out the guilt; and the grace of Sanctification, which removeth the filth: ſo that ſin is like leproſie, and grace regenerating makes all to come freſh and beautifull upon the ſoul, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was loathſome; whereupon it is, that a man is by Regeneration really chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the qualities of his ſoul: As originall ſin comes in the place of originall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, ſo this grace of Regeneration cometh by degrees in the place of ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſinne; ſo that if we ſeek after this work, we are not ſo much to look for it in our actions and converſations, though it will be ſeen there, as in our inward frame and diſpoſition of heart. The Kings daughter is all glorious within, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her converſion ſhe was all loathſome, and noiſome within.</p>
                  <p>Hereby it comes to paſſe, that as mens thoughts are greater or leſſer about origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin, ſo they are alſo about Regeneration.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, <hi>This native Corruption is deep and radicated in us, got into our</hi>

                     <hi>very bowels;</hi> That as Toads and Serpents have venome in their natures, and the one cannot be divided from the other, ſo it is with us, we may as well put off the nature of a man, as put ſinne out of it. This made the Father compare it to the Ivy in the wall, or in the tree, that getteth into the very heart, and cannot be removed, unleſſe the Wall it ſelf be pulled down; and that is the reaſon why the Scripture calls it our fleſh and members, not that it is our naturall ſubſtance, but inevitably cleaving to it, and the innateneſſe of it is herein ſeen, that although we have this work of Regeneration, yet it is not quite expelled, all this droſle is not got off. <hi>Paul</hi> complained bitterly of the reliques and remainders of it in his ſoul: Now the grace of Regeneration, that goeth as deep into the heart, that enters as pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully into the ſoul; therefore it's called writing of the Law in the inward parts; not upon the eyes, or hands, or feet, but in the inward parts. There is many a man <note place="margin">Jer. 31.</note> hath Gods Law written upon his tongue onely, or upon his outward converſation, but not in his inward parts: So that as the Scripture hath notable expreſſions to deſcribe how inward and rooted our filth is, we may apply ſuch things to grace wrought in the godly, onely there is this difference, ſinne makes us all over ſinfull, ſo that there is no good at all abiding in a naturall man; but grace doth not ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly heal to expell all ſin. As in naturall men, the imaginations of their thoughts are evill, not onely actions but thoughts, not onely thoughts but imagination of thoughts, or that very ſhop of the ſoul, whereby all apprehenſions and affections are minted and framed, though not perfectly: the imaginations of the thoughts of a Regenerate man are good and ſpirituall: The heart of a natural man is a Den of Thieves, a Cage of unclean Birds: The heart of a Regenerate man is the temple of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>By this you ſee, that all externall Reformation, all outward freedome of ſinne, doth not at all amount to this new Birth: the onely thing to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, is how far this oyle hath entred into thy wounds, whether it be as deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted as ſinne in thee; Oh this will diſcover what a rare thing Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is.</p>

Secondly, <hi>This Original Defilement doth firſt and more immediately corrupt the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>nature of a man, and then mediately his perſon, Prius corrumpit naturam deinde perſonam.</hi> Hence it is, that our Children have their defilement, whereas our perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſinnes are not communicated to them. Hence alſo it is, that an Infant new born, before there be any ſinfull motions, or expreſſions of it, yet is corrupted in its Nature; though it ſpeaks no evill, thinks no evill, loveth no evill, yet it is dead in ſin, and a child of wrath. Now the grace of Regeneration doth more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately tend to heale this naturall corruption, and then ſecondarily perſonall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions. Not as if a Regenerated Father could beget a Regenerated Child al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes, for ſo grace is perſonall, but becauſe it doth firſt renew and ſanctifie that principle and inward root of all affections and actions in us. It is diſputed in the Schools, whether grace be firſt immediately ſubjected in the very Eſſence of the ſoul, or whether in the faculties and powers of it. But we need not be ſo Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſicall and nice: This is enough to conclude, that grace doth firſt heale and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the ſoul, as it is the principle of all our actions; and then when this Fountain is clean, the ſtreams alſo are clean, when this root is ſweet the fruit alſo is. This is the good tree, and the good treaſure that our Saviour ſpeaks of. We ſee in the works of Gods Creation and Providence, firſt he gives Creatures their Nature, their kind and being; then he commands them to encreaſe and multiply. So its here, firſt God gives a ſupernaturall life, renewed principles, and then our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is anſwerable. Now this can never be enough preſſed upon men; they think by ſpirituall and godly actions to get ſpirituall nature; they think in Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> teacheth in Morality, by doing vertuous actions, to acquire at laſt the habits of vertue; but the Scripture is otherwiſe; we muſt firſt be born again, wherein we are altogether paſſive, and thereby be inabled to walk holily. Oh therefore that men would conſider theſe things, then would auditors be ſpirituall, when they once are lifted up to this inward ſupernaturall life: you are but Weeds and Brambles, what Bloſſoms ſoever you have, till you thus be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>This Corruption is the ſeed-plot, and root of all the actual impieties that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>are committed by man.</hi> Out of this evil Treaſure came <hi>Cains</hi> murther, <hi>Judas</hi> his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, and whatſoever crimes are at any time committed by the Sons of men; <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> bewailing his Adultery and Murther, preſently thinketh of this, as the cauſe of all. Thus the work of Regeneration is the ſeed-plot of all holy actions. Though the Scripture ſay, <hi>By faith Abraham and Noah,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>did ſuch worthy Acts;</hi> yet a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Regeneration was the root of all, therefore it's called Gods Law written in our hearts, his whole Law; ſo that whatſoever God commands outwardly by his Word, his Spirit doth graciouſly incline us to obey. It is here as it is in Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſin, though there be the cauſe of all wickedneſſe in him, yet by reaſon of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, or other temptations, he may incline to one ſin more than another; and there are ſome ſins which a man cannot at firſt commit, till he be hardened and made obdurate in his wickedneſſe; ſo there are many graces of a more Heroical and noble Nature, at leaſt the actions of them, that a man newly regenerated cannot preſently perform. But as your green Timber is not preſently ſit to be made Pillars to bear the weight of an houſe till it hath lain a while, and the moiſture of it be excocted; ſo neither are new Converts fit for thoſe graces of Patience and Victory over the world by ſuffering, which yet by degrees they obtain at laſt: And this might ſupport the people of God, who in their temptations are ready to think, that though ſuch ſins, and ſuch difficulties may be overcome; yet there are others again which they altogether deſpair of ever conflicting with; They are to know that as the Acorn is the ſeed of an Oak, and hath virtually in it all the ſtrength &amp; ſubſtance an Oak hath, thus the infuſed principle of grace hath virtually in it all the excellent expreſſions of grace, which are ſo apparently abovethem: and this alſo may comfort the people of God, who ſometimes though perſwaded ſuch and ſuch graces are in them, yet they are extreamly afraid there are other graces
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:30767:125"/>
again that they never had. For as a naturall man, though he abound in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe, yet hath the root of Prodigality in him; ſo a godly man abounding chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſuch and ſuch graces, yet hath thoſe other alſo in his heart, though not viſibly.</p>
                  <p>Again, this may alſo ſupport the Godly heart, that laboureth and trembleth un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the weakneſſe of his graces, a weak faith, weak patience, for he hath the root of all grace, he hath the Mine and the Treaſury, though there be not that graduall expreſſion of it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Becauſe Originall ſin is the root of all ſin, hence it is, that the ſtrength of ſin lyeth there;</hi> And the greateſt part of our wickedneſſe is in thoſe ſinfull in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations. <note place="margin">4.</note> The noyſomneſs of a Toadlyeth not in the venting of poiſon at this or that time, but that it hath a nature to doe thus alwayes; and this if duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, would deeply wound the heart of all Hypocrites, Moraliſts, and Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts: The greateſt part of their vileneſſe and loathſomneſſe lyeth within doors, is hid as it were under ground: Thy ungodly actions are nothing to thy ungodly nature. Thus alſo in grace regenerating; the ſtrength of godlineſſe lyeth in the inward work of it, grace is more excellently grace, and ſtrongly grace, as it is in the heart, then as it is in actions: God is a Father of the ſpirits, and doth delight moſt in ſpirit-holineſſe, and the graces of the ſpirit; <hi>My ſonne give me thy heart, and above all things keep thy heart, for out of it are the iſſues of life and death:</hi> As <note place="margin">Prov. 4. 23.</note> any wicked man is far worſe inwardly than outwardly, ſo any godly man is farre better inwardly than outwardly, ſo far as grace worketh at any time in him. The Waters are purer in the Fountain than in the Stream: Now how neceſſary is it for the people of God to think of this? they many times are carefull about duties ſee they omit none of them (and that is very neceſſary; for as Cloaths keep the body warm, and help the inward heat, ſo the vigorous exerciſe of holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties redouble the ſtrength of grace within,) yet the main care of a Chriſtian ſhould be to get grace more and more rooted in his heart; any holy duty done from grace in the heart differs from what is done without this, as the living from the dead: As a man that doth any wicked thing, yet if this have not got into his heart, it is not ſo dangerous; ſo any good action done, if the love of this be not in the heart, it is not comfortable nor acceptable.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, <hi>This Corrnption doth ſo plunge a man into ſinne, that there is a connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and agreement between his heart and ſin.</hi> As the Swine delights in mire and <note place="margin">5.</note> filth, becauſe of its loathſome nature; as the Beetle-flye delights in Horſe-dung, and is killed by ſweet Herbs, ſo a man naturally is carried out to act thoſe things which are ſutable to his corrupt heart, though never ſo offenſive to God. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary is in Regeneration, for grace infuſed makes us to delight in the Law of God, to love holineſſe for holineſſe ſake. Thus <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. ſpeaks of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Law of God in the inner man; and <hi>David</hi> preferreth it before all deſirable things, gold and honey, and his neceſſary food. A naturall man is ſaid <hi>to ſwallow down iniquity like water, Job.</hi> 15. 16. The Fevouriſh man findes a great deal of ſweetneſſe, and deſire after water, and thinketh he never hath enough. Thus <hi>David,</hi> he ſwalloweth down Gods Word like honey, he thirſteth, he never hath enough of God, or godlineſſe; when a man is Regenerated, he hath a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain within him, not a Ciſtern that muſt be filled with earthly motives to do what is godly.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>This Corruption is univerſall in the extention of it.</hi> This leproſie is of the whole man; this ſore is over all the ſoul, the mind darkned, the will rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <note place="margin">6</note> the affections unmortified, and the whole heart in great confuſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order; ſo that the Conſcience of a man, which we would think might be beſt, like <hi>Jobs</hi> Meſſenger, at leaſt to bring the ſad newes of all that hath befaln us, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is unpure and unclean. Anſwerable to this generall infection, the Apoſtle pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for the <hi>Theſſalonians, That they may be renewed thorowout, in ſoul, ſpirit and body.</hi> There is a body-filthineſſe, and a ſoul-filthineſſe; and there muſt be a body<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanſing, and a ſoul-cleanſing, and in this men wofully miſtake: They take ſome
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:30767:125"/>
illumination in the mind, accompanied with gifts and abilities in holy duties, for the thorow and univerſall ſanctification of the whole man; our preſent age is a Theatre upon which you may ſee many ſuch ſad ſpectacles: But this will not ſerve; as originall corruption is not ſin onely in the minde, or ſinne onely in the will, but ſinne all over; ſo the grace of Regeneration is not onely faith, or love, or patience, but all graces.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>The Apoſtle</hi> Rom. 8. <hi>doth deſcribe this fleſhly being in two things;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <note place="margin">7.</note> to which is our ſpirituall being; Firſt, that the fleſhly mind of a man is not ſubject to God, nor indeed can be: Herein this Originall corruption doth mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly diſcover it ſelf, that it makes a man full of enmity, and hoſtility againſt God and his Image whereſoever it ſhineth; there is no agreement between this dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and that light. This wretched frame is therefore called a ſtone, becauſe of its contumacy, no impreſſion is eaſily received, but it continueth obſtinate againſt all remedies whatſoever: on the other ſide, this work of grace is cal'd an heart of fleſh, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. in a far different ſenſe then the word fleſh is uſed in the Text; for there it ſignifieth plyableneſſe, flexibleneſſe, and a tender impreſſion made upon the ſoul, whereby he doth willingly ſubject his minde to Scripture-Truths, and his will to Scripture-Commands. Hence thoſe that are Regenerated are ſaid to be taught of God, and the people of God in the day of his power are ſaid to be willingneſſes; <note place="margin">Pſal. 110.</note> and herein the work of Regeneration is admirable, that it turneth the heart of a man to the love and practice of thoſe duties which are againſt his pleaſure, profit, and all outward advantages whatſoever; grace toucheth theſe mountains, and it makes them like wax to receive any form or faſhion: Now the heart renewed would be ſubject to none but God, and his will; no longer ſubject to the luſts and deſires of the fleſh, to the temptations of the world, to diſdain obedience to any thing but God, or for God. For the ſoul now to prefer the Creature before God in the love of it, is as groſſe as for the body to be proſtitute before an Image, and to worſhip that. The ſecond thing which the Apoſtle makes the fruit of being in the fleſh, is, that it cannot pleaſe God. To be carnally minded is death, ſo that whatſoever the unregenerate man doth is bitter fruit and ſour grapes. It is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination to the Lord, he is all the day long damning himſelf, and doing abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable things in the eyes of the Lord; If he eats, if he drinks, if he buyeth or ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, all theſe are curſed to him. Whitherſoever he goeth, the mark of Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is upon him. Now where the perſon is regenerated, there the curſe and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe of a mans perſon is removed by the grace of juſtification, and his duties are well pleaſing to God by ſanctification: for although in the court of juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is no blaſphemy to Gods ſpirit to ſay, that the gracious works done by us are a menſtruous cloth, dung and droſſe, yet if we look upon them in the ſphere of ſanctification, ſo they are graces and holy actions, and well pleaſing to God, their imperfection being done away through Chriſt; and thus as God ſmelt a ſweet ſavour in <hi>Noah</hi>'s Sacrifice, ſo he doth alſo in all the gracious duties the people of God perform, though the Incenſe that ſweetens all be the bloud of Chriſt. Therefore the Church of God is compared to a Garden, and every godly ſoul to a Lilly and Flower, and their graces to ſweet Spices; yet, ſhe is made altogether lovely; which although it hath its ground from juſtification, yet if the Church of God had had no inherent grace in her, we cannot ſay God would uſe ſuch expreſſions to her; whereas therefore before thou didſt pray, hear, God could not abide the, thou waſt a beaſt that made every thing unclean thou didſt touch; now God accepts of thy holy duties, thy prayer, faſting, almes-deeds; as he ſaid to the Centurion. Thus you ſee how that in every particular, wherein Corruption hath made any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement or breach, there grace doth make ſome glorious reparations; and as ſinne hath abounded in the filth of it, ſo grace abounds in the purity and glory of it.</p>
                  <p>In the next place let us conſider, why regeneration is thus neceſſary to ſalvation, becauſe of this corruption in us. And firſt:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="222" facs="tcp:30767:126"/>
                     <hi>The happineſſe of heaven is chiefly in enjoying of God;</hi> and having communion <note place="margin">Why Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proves a neceſſity of Regeneration, before we can be ſaved. 1.</note> with him: now how can man that is thus corrupt and wretched by nature, ſuch an irreconcileable enemy to him, be brought to this fellowſhip with God, as the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt bleſſedneſſe? If ſo be to Duties and Ordinances God requireth ſuch ſanctity and ſanctification in thoſe that draw near, how much rather to the enjoyment of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? If the pure eye that ſeeth the Sun, the Bat and Owl is offended at the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous beams thereof; God therefore and his glorious preſence would be a burden and a torment to a wicked man: They that bid God depart from them, becauſe of his holy Lawes, and his holy Ordinances, how much rather would they bid God depart from them becauſe of his holy preſence.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The imployment and work that God calls for in heaven is altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>with a wicked and ungodly heart.</hi> To praiſe God, and rejoyce in him for ever; to love him, and to delight in him, forgetting all Creatures, and be ſwallowed up in him as the Ocean of all happineſſe, how can the heart of a naturall man be thus affected? We ſee in this life how odious and troubleſome holy duties are to the godly heart; and therefore much more would heaven be an hell to an ungodly man. It is true, wicked men as <hi>Balaam</hi> may deſire happineſſe, but then they look to it onely as it is a preſervation from evill, and a preventing of torment; they doe not conſider the poſitive part in happineſſe, which is to glorifie God, and to delight in him. It was much that the blinde Philoſophers could ſtumble on this, to conclude that bleſſedneſſe conſiſted in vertuous actions, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt delight and happineſſe that could be was to doe juſtly; ſo that an ungodly man could not have <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> happineſſe, and doe we think he can have <hi>Pauls?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>There is a neceſſity of the ſouls regeneration, ere it can be glorified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would not be for the honour and glory of God to beſtow happineſſe upon ſinfull</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>men.</hi> As it's Gods glory to be holy, holy; ſo it's his Childrens glory to be like him in holineſſe: It is true, God needeth not our holineſſe, neither doth he want our righteouſneſſe, neither doth our goodneſſe extend to him; yet the outward ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of his glory is ſeen in thoſe that are holy: The place in the Temple that did repreſent Heaven was called the <hi>Holy of Holies;</hi> and if no prophane or unclean thing might enter the Temple, much leſſe into that more ſacred place. The Papiſts calumniate us, as if we were enemies to holineſſe, becauſe we make it not meritorious of heaven; but we plead the neceſſity of it, and God hath made an inſeparable connexion between holineſſe and happineſſe. As therefore this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ours cannot be glorified in heaven as long as it is thus vile and corruptible, it muſt be raiſed out of the duſt, and all the imperfections of it muſt be done away; ſo the ſoul muſt alſo have a reſurrection from, its ſpirituall death and loathſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ere it can be made happy.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things haply may be acknowledged as true by all, but who takes the right way to be happy? Regeneration is the writing of Gods Law; now is Drunkenneſſe, Prophaneneſſe, Pride, Worldlineſſe, Gods Law? Men might quickly ſee they are out of the right way to glory, if they would meditate on theſe things.</p>

Now our Saviour inſtanceth in a very fit ſimilitude. <hi>The wind bloweth where it liſteth, thou heareſt the ſound of it, but thou ſeeſt it not with thy eyes, neither art thou able to tell from whence it cometh:</hi> So that this ſpeech of our Saviour doth denote the difficulty of underſtanding this ſpiritual birth, not onely to the corrupt underſtanding, but alſo to the renewed: for this in the Text ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not from the imbecillity of the power or faculty to perceive, but the ſubtile and pure nature of the object to be underſtood: It is therefore the intent of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to expreſſe this ſpiritual birth, by a plain ſimilitude. Some there are that take the greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for the ſpirit of God: upon this rule, whereſoever it is with the greek article, there the ſpirit of God is underſtood; but that is not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, &amp; then it would be moſt improper: for it could be no illuſtration to manifeſt a thing by it ſelf, which our Saviour ſhould do if we take it ſo. <hi>Maldonate</hi> takes ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, or breath, for the ſoul of a man, and makes the ſenſe thus; As we do not know the nature of the ſoul, how it is infuſed, whence it cometh, or, whither it goeth, only we perceive the ſtrong operations of it; ſo it is in the work of Grace. But there is no juſt reaſon to recede from our Tranſlation in making it to ſignifie the wind, and ſo every thing will excellently agree.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Air is neceſſary, ſo that there is no living, or breathing without it: This work of Gods Spirit, is wholly neceſſary for this new birth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thou heareſt the voice of this onely, but thou ſeeſt not the winde it ſelf: ſo the godly hear the voice of Gods ſpirit ſpeaking to them to live, and as to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> to come forth <hi>out of the grave;</hi> ſo do the Children of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As we cannot tell the begining of the winds, for although the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers diſpute much, ſome making it the flux of the Air, others exhalations from the earth, yet there is no certainty; ſo it is in this work of grace. The world ſeeth men by the word of God new changed, new enlivened; they wonder and admire to ſee this alteration: men are divided in their thoughts about it: ſome ſay, <hi>they are of God,</hi> others <hi>of the divel,</hi> even as they differed in their thoughts about Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And then here is the liberty of Gods Spirit in Regenerating, <hi>He bloweth where
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:30767:127"/>
he liſt:</hi> To whom he will he manifeſts himſelf, ſo that all is to be aſcribed to the power of Gods ſpirit, not to mans ability.</p>
                  <p>Obſ. <hi>The work and Grace of Regeneration, is rather felt and perceived by him that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ.</note> 
                     <hi>hath it, then that which can be expreſſed, or made known to a mans ſelf or others, it being a wonderful hidden, and ſecret life.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The wind we feel and perceive in the motions of it; but the Originals of it, we are not able exactly to deſcribe: ſo it is in this great work: What the wiſeman ſpeaks about the framing of the child, <hi>We are not able to deſcribe how the bones, and all other parts of the infant are compoſed,</hi> Eccleſ. 11. 5. which made <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>He was fearfully, and wonderfully made.</hi> The like doth God do about our new birth, We are fearfully and wonderfully made again; ſo that the difficulty to perceive aright of this work, may ariſe partly from that corruption which is inbred in every one, and partly the unſearchableneſſe of the thing it ſelf; and to this latter Chriſt relateth: ſo that he onely who hath the inward power of it upon his own ſoul, can beſt diſcern of it: and we may ſay of this grace, as well as that of the Goſpel, <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, or ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man, to conceive what the work of God is herein.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the better diſcovery of this, conſider theſe things. <note place="margin">Particulars to clear this. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That the underſtanding of a man is not onely corrupted with ſin, but natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally weakned, ſo that it is not able to finde out natural truths, much leſs ſupernatural.</hi> The forms of things are hidden to us: <hi>Vitrum lambimus, pultem non attingimus;</hi> the fire, the water, a ſtone, none can have eſſential definitions of them: we cannot tell wherein the form or eſſence almoſt of any thing conſiſts, onely we deſcribe things by their effects, properties, and common accidents, and we have but the ſhell, not the kernel. If then the work of God in nature be ſo abſtruſe to us, and we know not what to ſay of it, How much rather the work of God in Grace? <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith, <hi>Divers questions may be made about a very fly, which no Philoſopher is ever able to anſwer,</hi> How much rather then in the hidden operations of Gods ſpirit? So that although it was <hi>Nicodemus</hi> his ſin, that he did not know, or believe the neceſſity of this new birth, yet it was a natural impotency, rather then a moral, that he could not tell how this wind did blow upon him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Men who have not the inward ſenſe of this work upon their hearts, may yet be able to give the deſcription of it.</hi> This they have either by learning, or read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of books, or hear-ſay; ſo that if you ask many, What regeneration is? They can tell you it is a change of the whole man from that ſtate of corruption we are born in, to the ſtate of holineſs: or it is the renewing of the image of God in us by degrees, which we have loſt: This account they are able to give; yea, a man may be able by way of diſpute and ſcholerſhip to ſay more, and diſpute more about it, then that man who is regenerated; ſo that many an Orthodox man is able to prove the neceſſity of regeneration, and to clear it in its nature, better then one not ſo perfect: but there is a Theological knowledge, and a practical experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal knowledge; no queſtion but an unregenerate man, may in a Theological way maintain Divine truths better then a regenerate man, that hath not ſuch abilities: a Godly man doth believe, when he is not able to anſwer all thoſe doubts and obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions that are made about any definition of faith, that is uſually given: and it is obſerved that many times thoſe that have the greateſt learning and parts, do moſt diſdain the practical plain things of regeneration: <hi>Surgunt indocti, &amp; rapiunt cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum,</hi> It was the old ſpeech of <hi>Auſtins, Ideots and unlearned men take the kingdom of heaven by violence,</hi> when learned men are ſhut out. <hi>Bradwardin,</hi> a great ſcholer called <hi>Doctor Profundus,</hi> the profound Doctor, ſpeaks of himſelf how offended he was at the reading of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, becauſe he had not <hi>Metaphyſicum ingenium,</hi> a Metaphyſical head: and we ſee by miſerable experience, what affectations men have to ſpeak, and hear ſublime Miniſters, and aerial notions, accounting thoſe things that make for our ſpiritual edification, and inward renovation, to be but plain ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicities;
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:30767:128"/>
but this will prove to be gold and ſilver, when the other will be only hay and ſtubble.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Although this life be a ſecret hidden life, yet many things about it are to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>be demonſtrated.</hi> Even as about the windes, although there be ſeveral opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Original of them, and we may in the general ſay, they ariſe out of the Eaſt, or Weſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the punctual particular Original of them we cannot: ſo it is in the work of regeneration; The cauſe from whence it is, is God, <hi>Unleſs a man be born of the spirit,</hi> &amp;c. So the Orthodox declare the manner in the general, that its irreſiſtably wrought in us by an inſuperable efficacy of Gods ſpirit, and although it be hard to ſhew the particular manner how the grace of God determineth the wil, and changeth the heart, yet that this is done is very apparent, and the Scripture makes it very clear; and the conſideration of this may bridle our underſtandings, and make us ſober, that we do not curiouſly pry into things; for if upon the utmoſt enquiry we cannot tell our natural conception and making, much leſs may we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend this ſpiritual making. We come therefore in the next place to ſhew where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">Wherein this new life is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible.</note> this life is ſo unexpreſſible; for we conceive this aſſertion of our Saviours, like that, <hi>Our life is hid with Chriſt in God,</hi> Col. 3. 3. The work of grace though it be admirable and wonderful, yet it doth not incur into the ſenſes: and this is that which makes many ſo Atheiſtical, and ſcornful about the work of Gods ſpirit in us. They either deny there is ſuch a thing, or they judge theſe things deluſions and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or the complexion of mens bodies: but as we do believe we have a ſoul, though we cannot ſee it; that there is a wind, though our eyes perceive it not; that there is a God, though no man hath ſeen him at any time: ſo it may certainly be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated that there is ſuch a work of regeneration, though we perceive it not with our bodily eyes: and this is neceſſarily to be preſſed; for the more we are aſſured that there is ſuch a thing, and that every one who would be ſaved, muſt have it, then we ſhall make the greater enquiry into this, whether we have it or no. The ſecretneſs therefore of this new life is ſeen,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>In thoſe travels, and agonies of ſoul which commonly it goeth through with</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                     <hi>er'e grace be formed.</hi> The ſpirit of God doth convince of ſin, and cauſeth bondage in the heart: we hear ſome crying out, <hi>What ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> For although a man be in this work of regeneration altogether paſſive, yea obſtinate and rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, therefore compared unto a ſtone, and a dead man; yet in other reſpects God works in us ſutably to reaſonable men, by enlightning our underſtanding, by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our eyes to ſee our miſery that we are under; as <hi>Dives</hi> when his eyes was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaw he was in hell, which made him cry out for eaſe: ſo theſe perceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves even dropping irrecoverably therein, and thereupon they cry out, <hi>What ſhall we do to be ſaved?</hi> When there is this diſcovery in the heart, then there are commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Earth-quakes in the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Now come to any natural man, ſpeak of theſe pangs and troubles of the ſoul, he knoweth not what they mean, he underſtands not the meaning of them: as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid to his miſerable comforters, <hi>Would your ſouls were in my ſouls ſtead, then you would feel what that wormwood and bitterneſs is, which I do undergo:</hi> ſo had thy ſoul been ever in thoſe depths of God, then thou wouldſt have known what it is to be in a ſpiritual travel. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the groans which Gods ſpirit worketh in his children, he calls them <hi>groans unutterable,</hi> Rom. 8. ſo are theſe ſighs unuttera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, bitterneſs, and pangs unutterable. It is true, theſe commotions of the ſoul are not ſo remarkable in ſome, as in others, neither are theſe things felt alike in all. But there is in every one a ſenſe and feeling of his undone eſtate, and hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs: now in all theſe things he is a man in a myſtery to the natural man: theſe things are tranſacted ſecretly in a mans heart: examine therefore thy ſelf: Haſt thou ever been a man thus affected, thus exerciſed? hath the ſpirit of God convinced thee of ſin? hath thy heart been loaded with ſin? hath the Law diſcovered ſin? hath every thing been as if turned into blood? As <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaw hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven opening to receive him, ſo haſt thou as it were hell opened to devour thee, here
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:30767:128"/>
are the beginings of a new birth; not as if regeneration lay in theſe, no, How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have felt ſorrow, terror, yet have proved abortives? but in many of Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, this is introductory, and when happily compleated, theſe fears and troubles are mingled with much faith and confidence: God hath ſaid to thy ſoul, as well as of the womans travel, <hi>In ſorrow ſhalt thou conceive and bring forth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>As theſe groans after God and his favours are hidden, ſo the principles from whence they are enabled, are wholly inviſible, and that not onely to the bodily eye, but to the mental eye of a natural man.</hi> A carnal man cannot think that any man doth any thing in reference to God, but upon carnal and worldly ſelf-principles: Thus the Phariſees, they charged Chriſt with vain glory, and his own kindred would have him do his miracles more publickly, that he might be externally advanced: they judged of Chriſt like themſelves: <hi>John</hi> 7. 3. 4. They did all things from world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly principles, and ſo they conceived Chriſt. The Apoſtle calls this work of Grace, <hi>The inner man.</hi> The glory of a Chriſtian is within; he prayeth outwardly, but his glory is within; he heareth with the outward ear, but his glory is within: It is the inner man, which is the root and the fountain of all his external actions: now as the root of the tree is hidden, and the ſpring-head hard to be found out; ſo it is here, from what inward principle it is that thou art carried out to do the things God commandeth is wholly to be ſought into. The Phariſees did againſt their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences blaſphemouſly make it a doubt, by what power he did thoſe wonderful things: but we may upon good ground ask, By whom doſt thou pray? doſt thou hear? Is it from Gods holy ſpirit, acting and enabling of thee? Or is it from thy own corrupt principles and ſuggeſtions; and this is that which comforts a godly man againſt all thoſe accuſations of Hypocriſie, which the world caſteth upon them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>As their principles, ſo the ſcope and intention of the whole man in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, is very hidden and ſecret, they being carried out towards God, becauſe of his excellency, and glorious fulneſs. David,</hi> how often doth he profeſs his joy in, and love of God? How doth <hi>Paul</hi> profeſs his delight in the Law of God in the inward man, and that becauſe it is ſpiritual? The Phariſees loſe the acceptance of all their performances, becauſe what they did, <hi>they did to be ſeen of men.</hi> It is true, Hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie is hidden alſo, and the corrupt intentions of wicked men are alſo ſecret: There is the hidden darkneſs of wickedneſs in a mans heart; but theſe ſincere inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſecret and admirable in a further ſenſe, becauſe the heart of a natural man, cannot do any thing upon ſuch pure grounds: his eye is dark, and therefore his whole body is dark alſo. As the earth cannot aſcend upwards, becauſe of its denſe and heavy nature; ſo neither can the heart of a man aſcend ſo high, as to do things for God, unleſs regenerated. Now until a man do things upon theſe pure motives, he can have no true demonſtration of grace in his ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The joyes and conſolations which aregenerated man obtaineth in his courſe of a spiritual life, are ſuch as a natural man alſo understandeth not. Thou haſt put more gladneſs into my heart,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, then they have had when their wine and oylencreaſeth,</hi> Pſalm. 4. It is called therefore <hi>unſpeakable joy.</hi> Thus groans are unutterable, and joy is unſpeakable; a ſtranger intermedleth not with their joy: What an hidden and ſecret thing is this, That they ſhould take the ſpoyling of their goods joyfully, That they ſhould in the midſt of the moſt furious and violent deaths, tryumph with joy. How unconceiveable are theſe things to fleſh and blood? As therefore Chriſt ſaid, <hi>I have other meat to eat of, then ye know;</hi> ſo they have other comfort and delight to take, then a natural man perceiveth of: were it not thus, How could it venture through all thoſe diſcouragements that are in the way to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? How could it endure in the wilderneſs, if this Manna were not provided for him? As poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet poſſeſſing all things. The ſupply and proviſion which God treaſureth up in his ſoul, is that which makes him wonderful: Oh therefore what enemies are all natural men unto their own peace and happineſs? It is not a life of Grace to have riches, honours, or great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in this world, but to have the favour of God, and his love ſhed abroad in
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:30767:129"/>
their hearts: See what a glorious triumph <hi>Paul</hi> is lifted up into, challenging all oppoſition in the world or hell againſt him. And thus <hi>Auſtin</hi> did much bewail, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rò te a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>avi Domine,</hi> O Lord, it was very late e're I began to love thee. How long doth a man feed upon husks, and is miſerable in the Creatures, till he come to eat of the fatted calfe in Gods houſe? Say unto thy ſelf, <hi>This is not all the ſweetneſs, joy, and comfort, that I might be made partaker of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Their courſe and conſtant way of their life, is alſo hidden. The life that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>I now live, is by faith in the Son of God,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. What is the matter, cryeth <hi>Chryſostom?</hi> Doth not <hi>Paul</hi> live as other men? Doth he not live on food? Doth he not breath in the Air, as others do? It is true, but this is not <hi>Pauls</hi> life pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly; but as the child in the womb lives an hidden life by ſucking nouriſhment from its mother, ſo doth <hi>Paul</hi> live an hidden life by deriving efficacy from Chriſt: we walk by faith, and not by ſenſe. Thus <hi>Habakkuk</hi> lived a Myſterious life; though the Figg treé did not bloſſom, though the Olive tree failed, yet he rejoyced in the ſalvation of the Lord, <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. 17. To live by faith is not a viſible known life to the world: The world hath no other oyl to ſupply their lamps with, but from the creatures, and when theſe decay, their hopes are at an end: but it is not thus with the Godly, <hi>Their life is hid in Chriſt,</hi> and therefore not to be taken away by any outward power: As the Parents lay up the treaſures of their children, that they may not loſe them; ſo that faith liveth, while all other things dye.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Their temptations and exerciſes are alſo ſecret.</hi> Look upon <hi>David</hi> in his <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>Temptations,</hi> How ſpiritual and hidden are they about the loſſe of Gods favour, and the light of his countenance? <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul? ſtill truſt in God:</hi> There are <hi>Temptations</hi> which wicked men are obnoxious unto; and there are again ſpiritual exerciſes, which the Godly are onely acquainted with; ſo that the nature of our <hi>Temptations</hi> will as much diſcover our ſupernatural life, as any thing elſe. Every ſtate and condition hath its excerciſes ſutable thereunto: The worldly man, worldly; the heavenly man, heavenly: and therefore it is neceſſary in a Maſter of Iſrael to know experimentally this kinde of life, otherwiſe as <hi>Eli</hi> charged mournful <hi>Hanna</hi> with drunkenneſs, when it was a ſpirituall diſtreſs upon her; ſo will they charge poor tempted Chriſtians with madneſs and folly, if they know not the nature of theſe exerciſes: They will quickly break <hi>the bruiſed reed, and quench the ſmoaking flax,</hi> being no wayes able to pour oyl into the wounded ſoul, till they have been thus wounded themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Their priviledges are admirable, but unknown.</hi> It doth not yet appear <note place="margin">7.</note> what we are: as Chriſt in reſpect of his outward humiliation did not appear the Son of God. The priviledges of Gods Children are juſtification, adoption, free acceſſe unto the Throne of Grace, and fellowſhip with the Father; now all theſe things are hidden. Who would judge, looking upon the afflictions, troubles, and miſeries of Gods Church, that they had ſuch priviledges? Should we not ſay of them, as was of Chriſt? <hi>They are forſaken and hated of God.</hi> But though others do not know what they are heirs unto, yet they themſelves do. This juſtification is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a white ſtone, <hi>which none knoweth but he that hath it,</hi> Rev. 2. 17. ſo that as the Tabernacle had a rough hairy covering without, but there was the pot of Manna within; Thus, though Gods people lie in an outward, rough, perſecuted, or affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted eſtate, yet they have Manna within: and in the ſenſe and full perſwſiion of this, they encounter with all difficulties, they triumph in ſtreights; ſo that if a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural mans eye were open, they would ſee how much is for them, though much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, <hi>Their encreaſe and growth is alſo hidden, and that by wonderful means.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">8.</note> Our Saviour inſtanceth in the ſeed ſown, that it groweth up, but the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man knoweth not how, onely he knoweth and ſeeth it grown: Thus the Godly man cannot perceive the growth of his faith, and other graces, onely he ſeeth that whereas he was a babe once, now he is a man: His light is clearer, his faith firm, his zeal hotter; ſo that as in natural growth of the body, a man doth not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:30767:129"/>
he is growing, onely he findes a difference in his ſtature at laſt. Thus it is here, onely here is this difference, that the ſpiritual motions and encreaſe of grace are more imperceptible then thoſe of the body. Therefore a Chriſtian ſhould not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately dejected under Temptations about its proficiency: Oh he is affraid he never groweth, he ſtill moveth on the ſame hinge: for if the rational workings of the heart be ſo hardly diſcernable, to feel that a man underſtands, and wills ſuch an object, much more the motions of the ſpirit: and as the growth it ſelf is hidden, ſo the manner of it; it encreaſeth by oppoſition, it gaineth by loſſes, it lives by death, it riſeth by falls, by ſins, by ſtumblings it gets ground.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe 1. Of inſtruction, Why wicked men are carried out to cenſure, and condemn Godlineſs.</hi> It is becauſe they know not what it is: Hence alſo they think it ſtrange, <note place="margin">Uſe. 1.</note> that they run not into the ſame exceſs of riot with them. The wicked are ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to ſee why they are not as voluptuous, as exceſſive in all carnal delights, as well as they: and all is becauſe they know not this ſpiritual life. All life hath its proper motions and actions, as alſo delights which keep it up. Therefore this ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral life hath its proper motions and joy: Therefore we may ſay as the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Come and taſt how good it is:</hi> Come and taſt what this regeneration is: feel the powerful life of it in your own ſouls, and then you will be otherwiſe affected then you are. The Phariſees ſpake evil of Chriſt, becauſe they did not believe God was in him, and with him: Thus thou harſhly judgeſt that for Melancholy, and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſie, which is the work of God, becauſe thou believeſt no ſuch thing as a new birth. As it is a great ſin to attribute that which cometh from the Divel, to the work of God, ſo it is a great ſin to make that which is of God, to come from the fleſh or Divel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe 2. How thankful they ought to be unto God, who have had this winde blow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.</hi> How many have lived and dyed in their natural condition? But God hath <note place="margin">Uſe. 2.</note> redeemed thee out of this ſtate of darkneſs. The Pſalmiſt makes it a great mercy concerning the plague to a Godly man, <hi>That many thouſands ſhould fall on the right hand and on the left, yet it ſhall not touch him:</hi> but here is greater, many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ſhall fall into hell on the right hand, and on the left, yet thou art preſerved. Our Saviour ſpeaks of two in a bed, <hi>one taken, and another left:</hi> Oh how great is Gods goodneſs? Two in a family, the one regenerated, the other not: two in a ſeat, the one born anew, the other not. How mercifull is the Lord to thee? How was Chriſt affected in this diſpenſation? <hi>Even ſo Father, for ſo it pleaſeth thee,</hi> and the Son revealeth the Father to whom he will, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. There are many great men, many rich men, many wiſe men, and it may be God paſſeth over them, and makes known this grace to thee. What? ſhall we ſo bleſs God for preſervation from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural death, that he recovereth from the grave, and not much rather from eternall death?</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>HAving in way of digreſſion obſerved ſome remarkable particulars in this excellent Dialogue between Chriſt and <hi>Nicodemus:</hi> I do now re-aſſume this Text, wherein a new Birth is ſo vehemently and indiſpenſably aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And becauſe we have already demonſtrated the nature of it; the next thing to be inſiſted upon is the Counterfeit of it, that ſo no more any may deceive themſelves, as if they had it, when they had it not. For who is there who hath heard the nature of it laid open, and the neceſſity of it preſſed, doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he hath it, although the work be ſo rare and ſupernatural? for a man would wonder, when Chriſt who is truth it ſelf, preſſeth this upon every man, let him be never ſo ſelf-righteous and ſelf-holy, what men think of themſelves; for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly either they do not attend to, or believe theſe things, or elſe they make no reflexion upon themſelves, ſaying, Am I ſuch a man; or elſe they vainly delude themſelves with hopes, concluding that to be the work of regeneration in them, which indeed is not.</p>
                  <p>Therefore to undeceive your ſouls herein, conſider this great work may be <note place="margin">Counterſeits of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> counterfeited in ſeveral reſpects. There may be much gliſtering, which yet is not this true gold; and becauſe our Saviour expreſſeth this work metaphori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, as a new Birth, we ſhall in alluſion to that, diſcover the falſe wayes thereof.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, <hi>As in the new Birth the ſoul,</hi> as you heard, <hi>brings forth in ſorrow, there are pangs and groans unutterable; ſo many men may be in great pain, fear and trouble about ſinne,</hi> As if ſome excellent and beautiful childe of grace were to be born, and yet at laſt after all thoſe pangs, there come forth ſome ugly Toad. Men after thoſe troubles and torments about ſinne, proving as loathſome, and as abominable as before; for men may be greatly afflicted in heart for ſinne, and the Miniſters of God may as <hi>Paul</hi> in another caſe, <hi>Rejoyce that they have made them ſorrowfull;</hi> They cry out in the agonies of their ſoul, <hi>We have ſinned grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The ground of this ſorrows fruitleſneſſe. 1. When Gods judgements are upon them, but when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved laid aſide.</note> 
                     <hi>what ſhall we do that we may be ſaved?</hi> And yet for all this travail the ſoul brings forth nothing but winde and emptineſs.</p>
                  <p>For, 1. <hi>Men may be in great troubles of ſoul about ſinne, while the apprehenſions of danger and Gods judgements are upon them, but when theſe are removed, they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſettle on their lees again.</hi> The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are a pregnant inſtance for this, while Gods hand was heavy on them, their ſins alſo were an heavy burden, <hi>Is their affliction they ſought God early, they humbled and mourned before him,</hi> Hoſe. 7. 14. but their hearts were not ſtedfaſt; when they had eaſe, and were delivered,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:30767:130"/>
they ſoon forgat God, who helped them. Oh (Beloved) we have too many examples of ſuch troubles for ſinne in our dayes! Take ſome men in deſperate ſickneſſes, when death the King of terrors is ready to ſeize on them, or while they are under ſome publick miſeries which do ſo immediately burden them they know not what to do. In theſe extremities, what confeſſions, what reſolutions have you? Do they not ſeem to be new creatures? You never heard them ſpeak, purpoſe, pray to God ſo before; you never ſaw them ſo affected and wrought upon as they are for a ſeaſon; but upon recovery and eaſe they preſently forget all, and were they prophane, worldly, negligent, yea oppoſite to God and his way? the ſame they prove again? Do not thou therefore deceive thy own ſoul, ſaying, I remember the time ſince my ſins have pained me at the very heart, ſince I roared on my bed becauſe of mine iniquities, I had no comfort in my life, ſinne made every thing ſo bitter: grant all this, but ask the Queſtion, How comeſt thou to be quiet again? How are thoſe <hi>windes and waves come to be appeaſed?</hi> Did <hi>Chriſt rebuke them and bid them be ſtill,</hi> or hath time wore them out? or hath the removal of the judgement removed alſo thy trouble? Oh if this had been the true ſpiritual travail of thy ſoul, no outward comfort could have appeaſed thee! No freedom from external calamity could have pacified thee, till thou hadſt in a godly manner obtained the light of Gods countenance, and be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with him. It was thus in <hi>David</hi> when wounded in heart for ſinne, though Gods outward judgements were over, yea though <hi>Nathan</hi> told him, <hi>His ſinne was forgiven,</hi> yet for all that his heart runs out like a fountain of water before God, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 51. And this, if rightly conſidered, doth break the pillar of many mens hopes.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Men may be in great trouble of heart, and ſo ſeem to others and to themſelves, as</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. When men labour by all means to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh the ſorrow they feel.</note> 
                     <hi>if they were in this new Birth, but all provefalſe, becauſe they labour to quiet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves with earthly advantages, and in a carnal manner labour to extinguiſh and to put out the ſorrow they feel.</hi> Theſe differ from the former, becauſe they are like the Hart wounded, that labours to eat out the arrow; ſo theſe being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for their ſinne are fretted and diſcontented at it, and ſo uſe all the wayes they can to ſtupifie their conſcience, and they labour that their ſinne may not alwayes be before them. How great and terrible ſoever theſe mens eſtates may be, yet it will vaniſh like ſmoke. For where God doth graciouſly ſoften the heart, there is a tender melting, and a willing mourning for ſinne, as <hi>Zech.</hi> 12. like a mother for her only childe; but in theſe men their hearts rage, and fret at the wounds, which God makes upon them, and ſo they are like the devils and damned in hell, who are full of horrour and gnawings of heart for their ſin, but yet blaſpheme God, becauſe of their hatred againſt him; Such an one was <hi>Cain,</hi> who cried ſtubbornly, <hi>My ſins are greater then I can bear;</hi> and therefore to eaſe himſelf, buildeth Cities and uſeth all means to divert his fears. Conſider there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, How haſt thou been under terrible apprehenſions of Gods wrath for ſin? Haſt thou deſired the ſanctification of them, that God would make a thorow and perfect change in thee? Or elſe haſt thou deſired to put out this fire, to bolt out this light? Haſt thou judged thoſe happy that live jollily in their ſins, and finde no pangs upon them? All ſuch tears are but like the waters of ſtanding pools that breed Toads and other Vermine. Take heed therefore that thy ſorrow be not a <hi>Cains</hi> ſorrow.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Men may be in travel and bring forth nothing but winde, becauſe in theſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. When men hearken to thoſe that cure wounds ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</note> 
                     <hi>they apply themſelves to falſe Prophets and falſe Teachers, who apply peace when there is no peace.</hi> As it was with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> outward condition. The falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets <hi>ſleightly cured her wound, and cried Peace, ſowing pillows under their elbows, Ezek.</hi> 13. 18. Thus it is alſo with falſe teachers about the inward eſtate of their people, they ſooth up men in their evil waies; They bid them die comfortably, believe ſtrongly, they bid them, <hi>Go and proſper,</hi> as he did to <hi>Ahab.</hi> This is <hi>dau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:30767:131"/>
with untempered morter,</hi> which when a froſt comes fals all to the ground again, and ſo when Gods terrible anger ſhall ariſe, all that falſe peace will tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ground; both the falſe teacher, and he that receives the falſe peace and comfort will fall into the pit together. And hence it is an heavy judgement to live under ungodly and prophane Miniſters, who uſually pour oil into all wounds, tell every man that is ſick or dying, his condition is good; but what ſaith <hi>Paul, If I ſhould pleaſe men, I were not the ſervant of Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 1. 10. that is, pleaſe men in a ſinful way, give content to them in their ſins; ſo that as in any outward ſickneſſe or loſſe it is a grievous ſin to go to the Devil and to Wiſe men, as ye call them; The Prophet ſeverely rebuked the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and told him, his childe ſhould die, and ſaid, <hi>Is it not becauſe there is no God in Iſrael?</hi> Its to deny the true God, and to make the Devil your God; ſo in ſoul-troubles to go to thoſe looſe teachers, who will proclaim peace to you, is to make all your ſorrow, and all your travail for ſinne in vain. Chooſe therefore a godly and wiſe Phyſician for thy ſoul in ſuch caſe, and ſay, Give me one, not that will flatter me, but inform me impartially about my ſins.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Men may be in trouble for ſinne, yet miſcarry, Becauſe of inordinate dejection</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. When men are inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dejected.</note> 
                     <hi>and black deſpair.</hi> This is not ſo ordinary, men being for the moſt part preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous, and there are few ſuch ſinners as the <hi>inceſtuous perſon,</hi> whom the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and people of God muſt comfort, leſt they be overwhelmed with deſpair;</hi> yet <hi>Judas</hi> was thus undone. As <hi>Rachel</hi> died in bringing forth of children; ſo theſe are damned in thoſe very ſorrows and fears they have about ſinne. God therefore who commands a ſoul to grieve for ſinne, and to come out of the pit of iniquity, doth alſo command the ſame ſoul to believe and ſeek for eaſe in Chriſt. We muſt indeed deſpair utterly in our ſelves, but not of Chriſt, and the ignorance of the acceptableneſſe of faith unto God, and how wel-pleaſing it is for the humbled ſoul to rely on Chriſt, keeps many of Gods children longer in the dark womb then they would. Inſomuch that it is a mercy of mercies in thoſe ſpiritual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies, to be directed into the way of believing. Thus you ſee that all pain and trouble wrought in the womb of the ſoul, doth not neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that there ought to be <hi>joy, becauſe a man-childe</hi> of Grace <hi>is born in the heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A ſecond ſort, which miſcarry in this new Birth, may be ſtiled <hi>Embryoes,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. There may be Embryoes of preparative workings with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1. When ſear keeps men in awe.</note> 
                     <hi>Such who have ſome initial and preparative workings upon their heart, but they die in the wilderneſſe ere they come to Canaan.</hi> And they may be reduced to theſe heads.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Thoſe who by fear are kept in their duty, and becauſe they are afraid of Gods judgement, therefore they forbear ſinne, and perform the duties required of them.</hi> This <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. is called, <hi>The ſpirit of bondage.</hi> The Spirit of God worketh ſuch a diſpoſition in them, though not the ſinfulneſſe of it, that they are kept from ſin, as the Wolf or Lion are kept from their prey, who otherwiſe would greedily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it. This is called by Divines <hi>ſervile fear,</hi> and although a man while he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no further is but an hypocrite, yet <hi>Auguſtine</hi> compareth this fear to the <hi>Needle that draweth in the threed,</hi> it is introductory ſometimes by the bleſſing of God, of a more excellent way; and in this reſpect there is a neceſſity of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate and the ſword to repreſſe evil men, <hi>If thou doſt ill, be afraid, for he bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the ſword in vain,</hi> Rom. 13. for howſoever this external force doth not ſweeten and alter the nature, yet by outward reſtraining of them, they may at laſt become ſenſible of ſinne, and in ſtead of leaving it for <hi>fear,</hi> afterwards for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake it for <hi>love;</hi> As <hi>Paul rejoyced the Goſpel was preached, whether for love or out of envy;</hi> So the Miniſters of God are to bleſſe God, men are reſtrained from out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward wickedneſſe, whether it be from fear or love, although it will not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable or ſoul-ſaving to thoſe, who do it only from ſervile and ſlaviſh fear. Let not men therefore think they have a ſure ſign of this new Birth within them, if
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:30767:131"/>
they finde this external change wrought in them; they dare not <hi>runne in the ſame exceſſe of riot,</hi> as they have done; <hi>they will ſet a watch before their mouths,</hi> that they curſe and ſwear no more; for if all this come not from a principle of love and delight within, in that which is good, here is no new Birth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Thoſe may be ſaid to have ſome preparatory work, who have ſome reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. When men ſet upon good purpoſes and reſolutions, their practices remaining ſtill the ſame.</note> 
                     <hi>and purpoſes to take up Christs yoke, who are not in flat oppoſition and contradiction to his wayes, but ſhew much general willingneſſe to imbrace his way.</hi> Of this ſort was that <hi>young man,</hi> whom Chriſt is ſaid to love, becauſe he was not <hi>farre from the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And there are many who declare good affections, ſhew a willing compliance with thoſe things that are good, but they move alwaies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this hinge. They never obtain any further degree in the waies of God; Oh what pity is it, that ſuch perſons, who come ſo near the haven ſhould yet ſuffer ſhipwrack, that they ſhould with <hi>Moſes</hi> as it were ſee the Land of Promiſe, and yet not enter into it! We tell ſuch they are not farre from true Repentance, they are not farre from this new Birth. Thy good affections and compliances with good men and good things, but going no further, make the Miniſter of God hope well of thee, and yet to be afraid of thee alſo. They hope well, truſting God will give thee more knowledge, work more inward power in thy heart, to break thorow all temptations, and to ſet upon the waies of godlineſſe, whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it coſt thee, and yet they are afraid alſo, becauſe where the fire of grace is, there it will burn ſometimes or other; where this life of grace is, there it will be growing ſometime or other. Thy good affections are more then leaves upon the tree, they are buds, only they continue buds, they never bloſſome; we cannot ſay thou art dead, and yet we cannot ſay, thou art alive, we do not perceive the breath of the life of grace breathing from thee. Oh therefore that this Sermon might be like a fiery nail (as <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> ſpeaks) faſtned by Chriſt in the heart of ſuch! If thy affections and diſpoſitions be real for God, it's not enough to ſtay there, <hi>Come out of Aegypt,</hi> do not be as <hi>Ephraim</hi> is called <hi>A cake half baked,</hi> the upper part towards heaven all dough, but the lower part baked. If God and <hi>Heaven be to be ſought for in the firſt place, if the Kingdom of Heaven muſt be got by violence,</hi> know thy good inclinations and ſweet affections will not be enough.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>They are Embryoes, who by instruction and good education of others, are trained in a way of godlineſſe, and in the conſtant practice of duties, but in time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. When all the good that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth is from the force of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation.</note> 
                     <hi>they never had the power of theſe things.</hi> Thus we read of King <hi>Joah,</hi> all the while <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the Prieſt was alive, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 12. 2. who had the tuition and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, <hi>He walked in the wayes of God, but when he died, then he turned aſide to do wickedly;</hi> and many ſuch there are alſo now adaies, who having godly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents are ſo accuſtomed unto the wayes of Religion, that they can pronounce <hi>Shibboleth,</hi> I mean, ſpeak and exerciſe the whole form of piety; but this is not a new nature wrought in them by God; it is their old nature painted and varniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over with good education. It is true ſuch inſtructions are a mercy; and the Wiſeman ſaith, <hi>The way a childe is trained up in, he will not leave.</hi> As on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary it is a woful curſe to be born of wicked parents from whom the children learn only to curſe, ſwear, lie, and to be prophane oppoſers of God and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; but yet this excellent education is but the external moulding of a man, not the internal renovation of his heart. It's like the midwifes bowing or ordering the limbs, it's not giving the limbs themſelves. Be not therefore deceived in this great work, Hath God moulded thy heart as well as parents thy life? Thy Father and Mother they have taught thus, and thou ſaweſt them live thus, but hath God alſo taught thee the power of theſe things in thy own ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Thoſe may be called Embryoes, who have many deſires and wiſhes that they</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. When good deſires are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by temptations.</note> 
                     <hi>might be in this happy ſtate of life, but then they have ſo many temptations, ſo many
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:30767:132"/>
obſtructions and pull-backs in the way, that they preſently give over. Balaam</hi> (though we do not conceive of him, as in a preparatory way to grace, yet) he <hi>wiſheth he might die the death of the righteous;</hi> and thus ſome cried to Chriſt, <hi>Lord evermore give us of this bread</hi> out of a confuſed appetite; theſe are like the ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that deſireth, but yet pulleth not his hand out of his boſom, therefore his <hi>deſire is ſaid to kill him.</hi> In this rank alſo you may have many who have inward wiſhes and deſires, Oh that they were ſuch in whom God delighteth! Oh that they might not only <hi>die the death,</hi> but live the <hi>life of a righteous man.</hi> Thus they deſire, but ſometimes carnal friends, husbands, neighbours, they throw water on theſe little ſparks, and preſently put out all, or elſe their worldly imploi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and earthly buſineſſes they freeze the heart, and make it ſenſleſſe, or elſe their own ſluggiſhneſſe and dulneſſe choaketh that good ſeed in them. Therefore do not think all is ſure, becauſe thou ſayeſt, though I be thus and thus, yet I deſire to do otherwiſe. Oh here may be a dangerous deluſion! Thy deſires may be thy ruine; for if thou only deſireſt, and there is no further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, thou reſteſt in thy deſires, and theſe produce no reall operations, they will prove but cobwebs to thee in time of danger. There is indeed a poſition of Divines, That the deſire of Grace is Grace; as hunger and thirſt argue a man is alive, and the promiſe of being ſatisfied is made to the hungry and thirſty, but thoſe deſires are ſpiritual, ſtrong, conſtant, efficacious, and produce migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty operations; compared therefore to hunger, which will break ſtone wals to get ſome food. Do not therefore tumble in this pit of deſtruction, many have ſuffered ſhipwrack at this Rock, ſaying, They deſire to goe to Heaven, They deſire to pleaſe God; but if thy deſire were earneſt and powerfull, it would put thee upon the uſe of all the means, that lead thee to ſuch a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed end. Notwithſtanding the ſluggards deſire to eat, yet his field was growne over with thorns and thiſtles, and ſo though thou deſireſt Heaven, yet thy life is the broad way to Hell.</p>
                  <p>A third ſort of thoſe <hi>who miſcarry in this new Birth, are Abortives, ſuch</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. There may be abortives as to an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life of grace, never coming to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity.</note> 
                     <hi>who come not to their maturity.</hi> Now although it be true, That in the true life of Grace there cannot be properly any Abortive, and where the life of Grace hath once been, though in the leaſt degree, that is an immortal and incorru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible life, yet we may call them Abortives, becauſe ſeemingly in their own judgement, and to all others they had the life of Grace, but yet it comes to no true ripeneſſe in them; Their Profeſſion, their Duties; are wilde Grapes. Theſe are denoted in the third kinde of hearers, in whom the ſeed came up, and there was Fruit, but ſaith the Text they did not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>They did not bring that fruit to perfection, to ripeneſſe.</hi> Thus Chriſt tels the Church, <hi>He did not finde her works perfect,</hi> Revel. 2. There was much outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing goodneſſe, but they were not ſolid, perfect works. Thy Duties are ripe, when all that ſour juyce and bitterneſſe is excocted, when they are not done out of Formality, Cuſtomarineſſe, Hypocriſie, when they are done from right Principles, in an holy manner, and to holy ends. So that thy Profeſſion, thy Family Duties, and all thy externall Demonſtrations of Grace, do not prove any thing, unleſſe they be ripe, and unleſſe Grace be predominant in them, though they cannot be done without all droſſe. But hath not God in his Providence ſhewed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> our Humiliations and Profeſſions have been to him, in the very fruit of the Trees, and the Corne of the Ground, nothing kindely ripes, but wateriſh, and ſo not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king wholeſome or pleaſant food for the ſuſtenance of man. Truely even ſuch hath our Righteouſneſſe, our Reformation been, and that under his Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Our Prayers, our Family Duties, our ſolemne Aſſemblies have been full of corrupt bitterneſſe within. As that Body cannot be ſound, though it may appear never ſo well that hath inward vitall Diſeaſes; ſo let thy outward

Converſation be never ſo unblameable and pious, yet if there be not a ſound conſtitution within, it will not endure; Know then this conſideration goeth deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then the former, this happily may ſhake the foundation of all thy Hopes and Comforts thou haſt had a long while.</p>

Thus a man that prayeth, cometh to Church, takes upon him Chriſtianity, and yet lives in prophane courſes, this man is a ſpirituall Monſter, and ought to breed horrour and terrour in all thoſe that behold his wayes Or ſuppoſe his life be outwardly clean, and there be no inward change; this is a monſter through defect, <hi>Thou hast a name that thou liveſt, but thou art dead,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to the Church, <hi>Revel. 3. 1.

If therefore the Lord at any time cauſe trouble and fear to riſe in thy ſoul about ſinne, pray that thou maieſt not miſcarry: Oh Lord, ſay, I fear all this pain may give over again; we ſee nothing more ordinary then ſuch miſcarriages; What is become of thoſe Troubles, Reſolutions and ſtrong Purpoſes that were once in thy heart? Are they not all vaniſhed? But this was touched upon before.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, A third Miſcarriage is, <hi>Want of Perſeverance, when men for a great while have gone on with much Fervency and Delight in Gods wayes;</hi> Who ſeemed more Zealous then they, more Religious then they? but afterwards prove wretched Apoſtates, and return to their old vomit again: Oh theſe are terrible and dreadfull monſters!

Thus many have been troubled for ſinne, found great burdens up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and what have they done? Betook themſelves to ſome Monaſtery, afflicted themſelves with many penitentiall Chaſtiſements, lying on the Ground, feeding on Herbes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This was to miſcarry in the Exceſſe; God hath not required ſuch things, and we are to manifeſt our Humiliation, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance only in ſuch wayes, and after ſuch a manner as God himſelf hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</p>

Doth the Word, though it convince thy judgement, yet make thy Converſation holy? Thou haſt the Name of a Chriſtian, but the life of an Heathen, or a Pagan; What a monſtrous Compoſition is this? If there ſhould be a ſoul of a beaſt in the body of a man, to informe it, the outward linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the body would not make him a man; for it's the ſoul that giveth the Specification, and Denomination. Thus it is here, Thou haſt the body of a Chriſtian, when thy outward life is conformable to his Law, but the ſoul as it were of a Beaſt, when thy heart is faſtened to any ſinne, and thy Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions glewed to pleaſures.

Oh thy heart hath been in ſuch fears, terrours, that thou needeſt Miniſter after Miniſter <hi>to pour Oyl in thy wounds!</hi> Oh where are all theſe? What is become of them?

                  <p>THe true nature of regeneration and the counterfeit thereof being already diſcovered, I ſhall onely inſiſt upon one corollary, which may be deduced from this Doctrinal point, and ſo diſmiſs it.

                  </list>
                  <p>For as children of men do partake of their nature, and commonly imitate and repreſent their Fathers in their manners and converſation; So thoſe that are born of God, are ſaid to be <hi>Partakers of the Divine nature,</hi> and thereby reſemble God, (according to our capacity) <hi>being holy, as he is holy.</hi> Now in the Sons of God we are to make a great difference between their right to heaven, and their holy nature and converſation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the former is not grounded upon their regeneration, for that is imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <note place="margin">1.

2. But then the other conſiderable property in our Sonſhip is, whereby we are <note place="margin">2.

So that theſe two carefully diſtinguiſhed, will keep us from proud preſumption on the one hand, and yet be a great incentive to Godlineſſe on the other hand.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Conſider that Chriſt is the only and true begotten of God by an eternall</hi>

Well, as Chriſt is thus naturally, ſo thoſe that are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated are thus graciouſly, and ſo are ſaid to be co-heirs with Chriſt: though there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are begotten of God, yet Chriſt is the firſt-born, and hath the preheminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in all things.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Conſider that we may be ſaid to be the Sons of God in three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects.</hi>

He that made them, will not ſave them,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Eſai</hi> 27. 11. Though ye are his creatures, yet having fallen from him to take the Divels character, he will deal no more with you as with his own.</p>
                  <p n="2">2, <hi>There are Sons to God by an externall Covenant, or adminiſtration of Grace.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. As in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> Thus men receiving the outward ſeal of the Covenant of Grace, and ſubmitting externally to thoſe Laws God preſcribes, are called Sons. Thus the people of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el are often called the ſons of God, becauſe of that external adoption, <hi>(Of whom is the Adoption,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul:)</hi> Even as in the new Teſtament believers are called Saints, becauſe of their external profeſſion, though they were not inwardly holy: <hi>Out of Egypt have I called my Son,</hi> which though principally applyed to Chriſt, yet Typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, as learned men think, it was true of the Iſraelites called by God out of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi> Now this Sonſhip is alſo but Nominal and Titular: To have no more of ſons then theſe outward badges, is but an aggravation of hell, and eternal torments, Thus Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The children of the Kingdom ſhall be caſt forth,</hi> Mat. 8. 12. Oh the terror of this: Many that are now called, and reputed ſo, the ſons of God, and the children of the Kingdom of grace, ſhall be thrown out from all thoſe hopes and expectations they had. Even as among the Iſraelites, though there came ſo many thouſand of them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and you would have thought that all thoſe who enjoyed ſuch miraculous mercies from heaven, ſhould have been made happy: yet two onely of all that number entred into Canaan: So of thoſe many that are

                     <note place="margin">1. By duty, ſhewing like affections in holy fear.</note> 
                     <hi>I be a Father, where is my honour,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1. 6. If we are to honour our earthly Parents, who give us onely (and that but inſtrumentally neither) a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily being, how much rather ought we with an holy fear to deport our ſelves before him, who is ſuch an Omnipotent Father, and hath other chaſtiſements even upon the ſoul and heart, which earthly Fathers have not. Now this filial fear is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent bridle &amp; check to all that wantonneſs and inſolency we many times run into, through our Fathers goodneſſe and kindneſſe to us: There is a ſervile mercinary fear, and there is a Filial ingenuous fear: the firſt is unworthy and unbeſeeming the ſon of God, but the ſecond is a requiſite condition. Obſerve theu thy ſelf: If thou art a Son of God, What holy trembling and fear will be upon thee in all thy approaches to him? His Word, his Ordinances will cauſe much inward reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and lowlineſſe of heart in thee: Earthly parents are not Omnipreſent, and ſo cannot be every where with their ſons, which imboldens them to do many things which they would never do, if their parents did behold them, nay they would not for a world their father ever ſhould come to know them. <hi>Jacobs</hi> children when they had committed that horrible act on their brother <hi>Joſeph,</hi> all their care was to hide it from their Father: but now God is a Father every where preſent; he is all Eye, <hi>There is nothing done in ſeceret, but thy Father ſeeth it.</hi> There is no heart-pride, no heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>earthlyneſſe, but thy Father ſeeth it. There is never a time thou prayeſt, heareſt the word, but thy Father ſeeth with what frame of Spirit it is. Oh therefore if thou art a Son of God, thou wilt diſcover it in thy whole carriage: a Son feareth the frowns of his Father; I dare not do this; my father will be offended; and I, Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall I go? Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, If ye call him Father, paſſe your ſojourning here with fear,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 17.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The Affections of Sons are ſeen in a patient ſubmiſſion to all his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſtiſements,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. In ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> 
                     <hi>for who may better afflict thee, then a Father? Whom I love, I chaſten,</hi> ſaith God: And the Apoſtle argueth ſtrongly from the leſſe to the greater, <hi>If we ſuffer our earthly Parents after the fleſh to chaſtiſe, how much rather the Father of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> Heb. 12. 9. He is a Father of our ſpirits, and ſo he may chaſtiſe us in them: fill us with darkneſſe, ſadneſſe, trouble, and grief of ſoul. Now this conſideration would greatly quiet the waves and winds which are ready to riſe up in us. What is the ground of all our impatience, diſcontent, and trouble againſt Gods diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Is it not becauſe we look not upon him as ſo wiſe, and ſo potent a Father? Who can do it better? Can the Artificer know when his gold hath been enough in the furnace, and he will not let it ſtay a moment longer: and ſhall not God know when he hath chaſtiſed thee enough: If thou hadſt a Child-like diſpoſition, thou wouldſt ſay, although all I feel be bitter, yet he is a Father ſtill. I have been an ill Child, and this makes him a Good Father in chaſtiſing.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The affections of a Son are ſeen in being carried out in all our obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him from an inward ſweet principle of love.</hi> In this ſenſe they are ſaid, <hi>Becauſe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. In obedience flowing from love.</note> 
                     <hi>they are the ſons of God, they are not under the Law.</hi> Not as if the Law were not a rule to them, but onely they are carryed out to obey it from a fountain of love: even as a dutiful child will obey his Fathers commands, although he had no eſtate,
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:30767:135"/>
or great inheritance to give him. And thus it is here, Though there were no Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or glory to beſtow upon a regenerated perſon, yet he hath that principle of love which would perſwade him to obey God. Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>As many as are led by the ſpirit, are the ſons of God,</hi> Rom. 8. 14. Such who have the ſpirit of God renewing their natures, and ſo guiding them by the word to their duties, theſe are the ſons of God: Not that it is unlawful for a child of God to have an eye to the reward: for it is ſaid of <hi>Moſes, He had an eye to the recompence of reward,</hi> Heb. 11. 26. The greek word ſignifieth a fixed intent eye: and every <hi>amor mercedis,</hi> is not <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenarius,</hi> every love of a reward is not mercenary, unleſſe it be wholly and totally for this, being joyned with no love to God at the ſame preſent.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>His affections are ſeen in his joy and delight in all thoſe duties whereby</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. Joy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in duties.</note> 
                     <hi>he may have communion with him. John 8. He that is of God, heareth his word.</hi> A Son delights to have letters from his Father, to have diſcourſe about him, eſpecially to enjoy his preſence. <hi>Truely we have communion with the Father,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>John:</hi> O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> then, What a diſcovery is this of thy ſonſhip? How art thou affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in praying, in hearing, in all religious duties? They are a conſtant burthen and trouble to thee; this argueth thee to be no ſon of God. Let not therefore vain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions carry thee aſide: It is not thy coming to Church, thy ſtanding within Gods Courts, that demonſtrates thee to be of God; but it is an heavenly and ſpiritual joy in theſe approaches. Doth faith work ſtrongly in God as a Father? Doth that improove with much ſweetneſs this relation, and hereupon thy ſoul be enlarged in much fervency of this ſpirit? This is to be the Son of God. Even as the Angels which in <hi>Job</hi> are called, <hi>The Sons of God,</hi> with much alacrity and joy delight in Gods preſence.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>The Son of God manifeſts himſelf in his hatred and oppoſition unto all ſin;</hi> For <note place="margin">5. In hatred of ſin.</note> every creature acteth according to its kinde; the Lamb according to the nature of a Lamb: and thus becauſe he is born of God, he acteth according to a Divine princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>That as God is a God of purer eyes then to behold iniquity,</hi> Hab. 1. ſo he is of a purer heart then to love and delight in ſin. <hi>He that is born of God ſineth not, neither indeed can he, becauſe the ſeed abideth in him, 1 John</hi> 5. 18. All men are divided into theſe two rancks (ſaith <hi>Auſtin)</hi> they are either <hi>Filii Dei,</hi> or <hi>Filii Diaboli,</hi> The Sons of God, or the Sons of the Divel: Now their works will manifeſt them. Art thou a man afraid of ſin, carefully ſtudying to avoid it in thy whole life? Haſt thou no more accord with it, then light hath with darkneſſe? And ſo for wicked men; Thou haſt no love to their company or councel; thou hateſt them with a perfect hatred; thou canſt with no more love and delight be with them, then the Dove a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Jays, or the Lamb among the Wolves, then thou haſt a ſure ſign of a Son of God: But if on the contrary, thou art prophane in thy life; thou loveſt thoſe that live diſſolutely; men that damn, ſwear, and prophane the Sabbath; thou art ſo fat from having <hi>thy righteous ſoul tormented with hearing and ſeeing ſuch things,</hi> as <hi>Lots</hi> was, as that rather thou rejoyceſt in them, and makeſt much of ſuch: What can be a greater demonſtration that thou art of the Divel then this? If the Divel were to act viſibly in the world, would he not live ſuch a life as this is? Men therefore need not think it ſuch an hard matter to know what they are: They need not ſay, <hi>Who will aſcend into heaven to let us know how it is with us?</hi> For thy out ward life and way doth proclaim to all the world that thou art of the Divel: And although it would make thy heart ſwell with rage to be called a childe of the Divel, yet know aſſuredly by the Scripture rules, we can give thee no other name. Oh that a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of thoſe who call themſelves Chriſtians, ſhould not be aſtoniſhed at theſe things: What to be children of the Divel, to be limbs of Satan? Yet by their works they demonſtrate themſelves to be ſo.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>The Sons of God they imitate God their Father in his love and goodneſs</hi>

If we conſider the matter precedent, we ſhould

have judged the natural conſequence to be, Be ye patient as your heavenly Father is patient; but becauſe goodneſs even to bad men, to enemies, is the higheſt degree of graces, and as it were the perfection of all, and without which, <hi>let a man speak with the tongue of Angels, and work all kind of Miracles,</hi> yea be eminent in all matter of Godlineſs, yet be without this, he is not a perfect Chriſtian. Therefore under all the injuries, oppreſſions, and deſperate perſecutions, <hi>although revenge,</hi> as the heathen ſaid, <hi>be ſweeter thou hony it ſelf:</hi> yet conſider what God thy Father doth: How do wicked men provoke him every day, yet for all that he doth not make the earth preſently gape to devour them!

The Scripture giveth many ſigns of Grace, yet none is ſo remarkable and commended as this, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. And howſoever ſome Papiſts think, to love our enemies is a meer coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell for perfect men, not a duty to all Chriſtians, yet it is plain our Saviour preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it upon all who would be the children of God: and howſoever this be not ſo much preſſed and preached, we Chriſtians do not among other ſymptomes of Grace look after this, yet it is plain the Scripture makes this one of the chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and is a ſign Grace hath great dominion over thee when thou art enabled to do this. Some malicious heathens once met with a Chriſtian, and beat him even unto death almoſt, asking him, <hi>What great matter ever Chriſt did?</hi> Even this great thing, replieth the Chriſtian, <hi>That I can for give you, though you uſe me thus cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> I confeſſe many who yet live in their ſins, and diſcover no power of Grace, will yet proclaim their love to their enemies, and that they forgive them with all their hearts: but this is eaſilier ſaid then done; and although we read of heathens who have been admirable in this way, yet they not doing of it by the ſpirit of Chriſt, but from an humane generoſity, obtained thus much onely, That they ſhall he leſs puniſhed then malicious revengefull perſons.</p>

And thy body is not made more upright towards heaven, then thy ſoul is made that way by grace. Hence we are ſaid, <hi>To ſit with Chriſt in heavenly places:</hi> and as pearls and precious ſtones, though for the matter of them they be of inferiour ſubſtance, yet in their colour, luſtre, and glory, they reſemble the heavens, from whom comes the greateſt influence to make them: Or as the Clouds, though generated from Vapours and exhalations ariſing from the earth, yet in their motions are wholly carried up and down according to the heavens; ſo theſe men though they have earthly bodies, live on the ſame food, breath in the ſame air as others do, yet are formed into the glorious likeneſſe of God; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſons of God, diſdain to ignoble and debaſe themſelves by any filthy luſts: As <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> ſon, becauſe he was loved had a coat of divers colours beſtowed on him, ſo God beſtoweth ſeveral graces upon his people. <hi>The Queens daughter is in curious needle-work,</hi> and for her to go and tumble in the mire, is more beſeeming a ſwine then a Queens daughter.

Circumciſion and uncircumciſion, all your conference, all your ſtudies run out about this; but the truth of grace lyeth not in theſe things.

This Doctrine is ſo neceſſary, and ſo worthy of all acceptation, that the Apoſtle addeth, <hi>Whoſoever walketh after this rule</hi> (that is) as ſome expound, according to this poſition, that no externall duties are accepted without a new Creature) <hi>peace be on him and mercy.</hi> The receiving of this truth, is opening of the door for the peace of God to reſt on you.</p>

Though the Chaff be worth nothing when the Wheat is not, yet it was a great defence and ſhelter to the Wheat when it covered it growing in the field. Outward duties are not to be oppoſed to the work of grace, but compoſed; you muſt not argue from one, to the deſtruction, but to the poſition of the other.</p>

Take heed therfore of that dangerous Rock on one hand, to neglect the ordinances, expecting immediate Revelations, and Enthuſiaſms; or on the other hand, a propliane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of them, even as the Swine doth a Pearl.</p>
                  <p>Now let us conſider, <hi>Why God careth not for thoſe externall duties, without the work of Regeneration.</hi> If thou prayeſt and heareſt in that old ſtate thou wert born in, and not renewed, theſe duties are like wild Grapes. And,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe God doth not graciouſly accept any man, but where he ſeeth his own likeneſs, his own ſimilitude.</hi> Thus God made man at firſt <hi>after his own Image,</hi> that ſo <note place="margin">

A renewing after the Image of God.</hi> It is a known Rule, That <hi>likeneſſe is a cauſe of love.</hi> And this
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:30767:138"/>
holdeth in ſome proportion between us and God: For although this new Creature of grace hath many imperfections and deformities in it; yet for the ſubſtance and main it's the likeneſſe and Image of God, and ſo for Chriſts ſake he accepts of it.</p>
                  <p>Is it any wonder then, if the prayer, the hearing of a wicked man be an abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination? for God ſeeth there the Devils likeneſſe, the reſemblance of Satan, and how can he entertain ſuch? Say then to thy ſelf. I goe to pray, I goe to hear to day, but is there any thing of God in me, am I holy, as he is holy in ſome degree? If not, God ſeeth nothing but what he hates and abhorreth in me. Thoſe outward duties they put not a divine ſtamp upon us, but this inward change wrought by God. How then is it, that you are no more ſollicitous in this great matter? why ſhould you not be as much afraid of praying without a new heart, as not praying at all; of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring without a new heart, as not hearing at all?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God doth not regard outward duties unleſſe we be new Creatures be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <note place="margin">2. We cannot perform duties upon right grounds, unleſs regenerated</note> 
                     <hi>we are not able without this to perform them upon ſpirituall and ſupernaturall grounds:</hi> And unleſſe all our duties be grafted upon this ſtock, they are no more than Brambles and Thorns fit for burning: now the ſupernaturall ground in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hearing is becauſe of God, and in reference to him: <hi>Iſrael was an empty Vine,</hi> in all her duties, becauſe <hi>ſhe brought forth fruit for her ſelf, Hoſ.</hi> 10. 1. ſhe did not turn to God, even unto him. The Motive or Loadſtone to draw our affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions in any ſpirituall exerciſe, muſt be Gods goodneſſe, holineſſe, and ſpirituall excellency: <hi>The Virgins love thee, becauſe of thy oyntment powred forth, Cant.</hi> 1. 2. Chriſt raxeth his followers becauſe of his loaves; and the Apoſtle reckoneth it as an Argument, <hi>That all old things are paſſed away, and all things are become new,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, <hi>they know no man, no nor Chriſt himſelf after the Fleſh, 2 Cor.</hi> 5. They do not look for carnall advantages by Chriſt, but love him and obey him becauſe of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall grounds; now a ſtone may as well flye up into the aire, as a man without this new Creature be carryed out in Religious duties upon ſpirituall grounds. A Beaſt may as well ſpeak and underſtand reaſon as a naturall man diſcern and be affected with ſpirituall Motives; and yet if this be not, a man in all religious duties is like <hi>David in Sauls Armour,</hi> they are too big and great for him, he knoweth not how to manage them: Conſider then, How can I pray, or hear upon thoſe ſupernaturall Motives which God requires, if this new nature be wanting? How can Im prayer rejoyce in the promiſes of God, mourn becauſe of the foul and loathſome nature of ſinne, if there be not this good foundation laid? This then is all in all, and yet we doe not above all attend to this: Therefore as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, commending the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, ſpeaking with tongues, working of Miracles, &amp;c. <hi>Yet I ſhew y<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>u a more excellent way.</hi> So, though ye doe well in praying, in hearing, yet there is a more excellent and more neceſſary way, and that is to perform all theſe by a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, renewed principle within.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as Religious duties cannot be performed graciouſly without this, ſo, <hi>Neither is a man a fit ſubject to receive thoſe ſpirituall benefits communicated by God</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. We are not fit to receive the benefits of duties without regeneration.</note> 
                     <hi>in them, without this.</hi> Unleſſe a man be a new Creature he knoweth not what it is to have Communion and Fellowſhip with God in Prayer and Sacraments; He cannot taſte of the <hi>comforts</hi> and <hi>joyes</hi> in the Holy Ghoſt; ſuch expreſſions as thoſe, <hi>I will come and ſup with him, and he with me; and my ſoul panteth after the living God, when ſhall I come and enjoy him?</hi> he is not able to underſtand: There is in the ſpirituall diſcharge of holy duties, a very heaven, a comfortable enjoying of Gods preſence; <hi>I will dwell with them, ſaith God, 2 Cor. 6. and yee are the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, 1 Cor.</hi> 3. But (alas) theſe are unſpeakable miſeries to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man. In all duties they have but the bone as it were, not the marrow; they ſtand in the Porch of the Temple, they doe not enter into the Holy of Holies; They doe not feel what <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> and all thoſe holy Servants of God have felt in Gods Word; what ſhould move you more to ſeek after this new Creature than this? To think theſe Ordinances are but husks to me, and Manna to others; they are but a Wilderneſſe to me, when a Garden to others; others goe home bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

and praiſing God, as if they had been in a glorious transfiguration, but I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn earthly and ſtupid. Oh why is all this, but becauſe I want this new Creature; then it wouldbe new praying, and new hearing.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, therefore no outward Duty or Privilege is accepted without a new <note place="margin">4. Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration are are inſeparably united.</note> Creation, <hi>Becauſe juſtification and this new Creature are inſeparably united toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and cannot be one moment divided from each other,</hi> Rom. 8. <hi>There is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to thoſe who are in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> (there is Juſtification:) <hi>Who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit,</hi> (there is Sanctification:) Now ſeeing that juſtification is the ground of all acceptance both of our perſons and duties, and this is alwayes concomitant with a new Creature; therefore without this, that hath neceſſarily adjoyned to it a ground of all acceptance, we can never be regarded by God. Oh therefore think with thy ſelf, The prayer of a juſtified perſon is onely approved of, God hath firſt <hi>respect to Abel,</hi> and then <hi>to his Offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring:</hi> You muſt not think by praying and hearing to get your perſons accepted, but they muſt be firſt accepted, that your duties may; now this juſtification is of none but this regenerated perſon: Why ſhould ye not hearken diligently to theſe things, for if all thy duties hitherto have not been accepted, thou art to begin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, to lay a new foundation; and certainly it is the neceſſary duty that lyeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many perſons, though Chriſtians, to raze the very foundation they have built all their hopes upon; they have trodden in a road, judge of acceptance with God according to the principles of Reaſon, and the light of Nature, but have not infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themſelves out of Gods Word, for by that we muſt attain to thoſe two great works of God, Juſtification and Sanctification; Juſtification to reconcile our Perſons; Sanctification to make holy our Natures and ſpiritualize all our Duties; and if theſe two be not in us, God rejecteth all our Duties, as the Artificer in, his building doth ſome crooked ſtone that he cannot make ſtraight.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, God doth not accept our religious ſervices without this new Creature, <note place="margin">5 Duties are nor in a true ſenſe good without the new Creature.</note> becauſe <hi>they cannot be ſo much as called good, and holy in a Scripture-ſenſe without this.</hi> God ſaith not unto thee as unto the Centurion, <hi>Thy Prayers are heard;</hi> Neither doth God, as it's ſaid of <hi>Noah</hi>'s Sacrifice, <hi>ſmell a ſweet ſavour,</hi> till thou art made new, and changed from thy Originall eſtate. For they are not good or well done, becauſe to have a good action there is required all the conditions, <hi>Bonum eſt ex integris cauſis, malum e quolibet defectu,</hi> one defect is enough to make an action evil, but it cannot be good unleſſe all circumſtances are concurrent; now the Scripture, to have it good praying, good hearing, requireth; Firſt, <hi>That the man himſelf be made good: Make the Tree good, and then the Fruit will be good; Cleanſe the inſide firſt:</hi> The heart is the good Treaſure; ſo that a man cannot do any thing after a godly manner but by a renewed nature, he may doe it after a cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary and ſeeming religious manner, ſo that men may admire it, but he cannot do it with a gracious foundation, till his nature be healed: Then as the principle muſt be good, ſo the manner alſo, that is, after a fervent, zealous and heavenly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, not with a meer lip-labour, or bodily preſence; there muſt be motions and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſtirrings of heart: Take heed how you hear, and pray with <hi>groans unutterable:</hi> and laſtly, as you heard all this muſt be to God, <hi>pleaſing God,</hi> aiming at God, loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at God, and not at man; ſo that all our ſpirituall duties are to be of him, and by him, and to him; and no wonder if ſo much be required to the right diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of any holy duty, for <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> requires as much to any virtuous action; He ſaith, That onely can be called a righteous action which is, <hi>juſta, à juſto, juſta,</hi> from a juſt man, in a juſt manner; and ſo that is onely a godly duty, which is done by a godly man, in a godly manner, to a godly end.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, This new Creature is looked after, rather than any outward duty, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6. True Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianiſm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in the new Creature.</note> 
                     <hi>in this true Chriſtianiſm doth conſiſt.</hi> A man is not really and properly a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, becauſe Baptixed, becauſe he profeſſeth Chriſt, and worſhippeth him, but becauſe he hath this new Creature in him, and this is the ſcope of <hi>Paul</hi> in the Text: So that as in the time of the Old Teſtament, true <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> or the true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:30767:139"/>
of a Jew did not conſiſt in being outwardly Circumciſed, but it was in that of the heart, <hi>and he was a Jew which was ſo inwardly,</hi> Romans 2. Thus he is a Chriſtian, not who is outwardly baptized, but who is inwardly anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the graces of Chriſt; for to be a Chriſtian is to be an anointed one; and then of this inward Jew ſee what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Whoſe praiſe is of God, not of men.</hi> It's God that is a <hi>Father of ſpirits,</hi> that looks to the hearts of men, that praiſeth this Jew, this Chriſtian. <hi>The denomination of every thing is from its chief and better part.</hi> We call a man reaſonable, becauſe of his ſoul the chief part of him; ſo a man is called a Chriſtian, not ſo much becauſe he prayeth, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, cometh to Church, which is but like the body; but becauſe theſe are done by a renewed nature within, which is like the ſoul. O then know, as every Profeſſion hath its Art, its Skill, its Myſtery, which a ſtranger hath not; ſo hath Chriſtianity; there is a Myſtery of praying, a Myſtery of hearing, which the naturall man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth not.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>If external duties were enough without this new Creature, then the way to heaven would be a broad eaſie way.</hi> Whereas the Scripture ſets down a peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory <note place="margin">7. Otherwiſe Heaven way would be broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der then Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture allowes.</note> poſition clean contrary; <hi>Streight is the way,</hi> and <hi>ſtrive to enter into it,</hi> and <hi>Few enter in it.</hi> But if no more were required to pray and hear then moſt men doe, it would be a broad way, every man would enter into it. There needs no ſtriving, no agonies to ſuch duties: A man in prayer muſt have <hi>a broken contrite heart;</hi> it is a Metaphor from a broken bone, which cannot be without much pain and torment; ſo a broken heart in a duty cannot be without much ſenſe of grief, ſhame and ſpirituall confuſion; and as when any thing is broken, we ſee what is in the midſt of it, which did not appear before; ſo in a broken heart we diſcover all that foulneſſe, all thoſe loathſome Monſters, all that horrid impiety, which we had no acquaintance with before. And oh that this truth had got full poſſeſſion in your hearts! Every religious duty, if rightly performed, puts the heart into a great agony: They are but few that can enter into this ſtreight way: Therefore ſay, I fear my praying, my hearing, my walking is too broad a way, too large a way, it doth not wound deep enough, or affect throughly.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Theſe externall duties are nothing without a new Creature, <hi>Becauſe while</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">8. No faith interreſting us in Chriſt without the new creature.</note> 
                     <hi>this is abſent there cannot be faith to apply Chriſt, and bring him to dwell in the ſoul who onely is the meritorious cauſe of all acceptance with God. Without faith its im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> By faith we are juſtified, we have boldneſſe: Now this faith cannot be but in a new nature; yea its made equivalent to this new Creature; for that which the Apoſtle calls here a new Creature, in the Chapter mentioned before he expreſſeth it, <hi>By faith working with love.</hi> As <hi>in the Holy of Holies every thing was Gold, or covered with Gold; ſo all that is accepted with God, is either Chriſt, or Duties covered with Chriſt.</hi> Til therefore thou art a new Creature, thou canſt not put forth an act of faith, there wants that <hi>Hyſſop</hi> which ſhould <hi>ſprinkle Chriſts bloud</hi> upon thee; and howſoever people may think and ſay they believe in Chriſt, yet its impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to doe it, till they be born again; for to believe in Chriſt is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt grace, and ſo needeth the greater power of God.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, thereupon it is, that we muſt be new Creatures in all our duties, <hi>becauſe Gods Promiſe is onely to ſuch duties that flow from ſuch a Fountain.</hi> There is no <note place="margin">9. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to duties are onely as they come from new Creatures.</note> promiſe made ſingly to bare hearing, and bare praying, but to thoſe that are done with a godly heart, with the whole heart: To thoſe that are <hi>poor in ſpirit;</hi> to thoſe that <hi>turn from their evil wayes,</hi> and all theſe properties are the fruit of the new Creature. If therefore there can be no promiſe, then there can be no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance: Now what a terrible conſideration is this! Thou that liveſt in thy ſins, thou that <hi>refuſeſt to be reformed,</hi> yet thou prayeſt, thou heareſt, think with thy ſelf what promiſe is there in all Gods Word, that I may challenge. What Word of God is there to encourage me to pray in hope, to hear in hope; ſo that by this you ſee the abſolute neceſſity of this point: Well might the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Pace be on</hi>

                     <hi>this onely gives life, vigour, and power to them:</hi> they are but dead works; as a dead eye, or a dead hand without this ſupernaturall life. This new Creature is the root that communicates all juice, and ſap to theſe branches; This is the kernell, the other is but the ſhell: out of this renewed heart come renewed duties; ſo that as long as you are defective in this, whatſoever parts, abilities, inlargements you have in any duty, you are ſtill defective in the main.

                  <p>No Angels, no men are able to work this in a mans heart, but as a man though he beget the body of his ſonne, yet not the ſoul, for that is infuſed by the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſpirits. So though men come to Church, and-outwardly hear, and though the Miniſters of God they labour faithfully in preaching, yet it is God only that makes <hi>this light ſhine in the heart. Paul plants and Apollo watereth, but God giveth the increaſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. The Gardener doth only uſe his outward means,
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:30767:142"/>
he doth not make the tree, nor can he make any one apple that groweth upon it. I ſhall not at this time inſiſt upon the nature and operations of this new creature, that will be proper when we ſpeak of the Adjunct; but of the efficient cauſe of this, that ſo we may know where to have it. As God onely created the world, and all the things therein, ſo he onely doth this new world of grace. Thus <hi>Auſtin</hi> defined grace, <hi>Bona qualitas facta in nobis, ſine nobis,</hi> Wrought in us without our help and power: Now that this work of grace is wrought in us by God meerly, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>In that it's called a Creation. and God onely can create.</hi> For to create there <note place="margin">

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>An infinite vertue and power;</hi> in ſo much that the moſt ſolid Divines do hold, That no Creature can be uſed as an inſtrument in Creation, much leſſe be a principall: For ſeeing it is the giving of a Being to ſomething out of nothing, no Creature can work but upon ſome materialls provided; But God when he Created the world, when he made that Chaos, there was nothing pre-exiſtent: Hence that power of God which turneth our hearts unto him, is ſaid to have <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Epheſ. 1. 19. an exceeding great ſtrength with it;</hi> compared to that <hi>power of raiſing Chriſt from the grave.</hi> Hence Chriſt in converting the hearts of men towards him, making them at his command to follow him, demonſtrated his Divine Power more than in all externall miracles. Oh then we need not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſee men love their ſins and delight in them, notwithſtanding they hear and know to the contrary. Alas the Miniſters are not able, no more than the women at Chriſts Sepulchre were, to remove the ſtone upon mens hearts, yea this is hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier than that, for there came an Angel and rolled it away; but here God onely can ſpeak to this Mountain to be removed into the Sea; ſee we then a man by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture dead in ſinne, and by voluntary practice buried in it; if ever this man came to be holy, and to live in holineſſe, wonder at it, as if a new world were made; for onely an infinite power could make this alteration, As Divines to prove that God made the world, it could not be made of it ſelf, give many fit examples to convince thereof: If a man ſee a glorious houſe built up in a curious and moſt exact manner, he concludeth, That houſe did not make it ſelf; or if one have an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of muſick curiouſly tuned, and excellent Muſick played upon it, he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, This doth not make it ſelf, or its Muſick; ſo the world being ſo curiouſly and harmoniouſly compoſed, called therefore <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, did not of a ſuddain put it ſelf into this excellent glory: As they argue thus from the world, we may much more argue from the godly life of a Regenerated man, ſee ſuch a man leaving off with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation all his former wickedneſſe, and that becauſe he loveth God, and deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in holineſſe, ſee you him acting above the praiſes of men from God, and to God; this man could not do this of himſelf, but God hath changed him. Seeing therefore an infinite power is put forth by God to make us thus new Creatures, well may we exclude man from being partner in this work; ſo that as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth well, We are the Creatures of God, both <hi>quâ homines,</hi> and <hi>quâ juſti;</hi> As a man thou art Gods Creature, as a renewed man much more Gods Creature.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>In Creation the Creature is made of nothing;</hi> and thus Creation differs from the works of men, which alway ſuppoſe matter aforehand to work upon. Thus in <note place="margin">II. The Creature is made of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</note> this ſenſe, the Chaos, or confuſed heap, that was properly created, becauſe made of nothing, yet the works on the other dayes are ſaid to be created; becauſe, though they were not made of nothing, as the Sun and Mans Body, yet of matters alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether indiſpoſed, and unfit; and this ſome Divines call Creation <hi>mediate,</hi> as the former Creation <hi>immediate.</hi> Now in this ſenſe the work of Grace is truely called a Creation; for there is nothing in us that did cooperate, or conſent to it; our hearts are dead wombes, till God cauſe us to live, and in this reſpect the Scripture doth repreſent us ſo full of ſinne, and all over corrupted, that thereby the work of grace may be acknowledged onely of the Lord; Thoſe are derogatory Doctrines to the grace of God, that ſay grace doth onely ſtirre up and excite the naturall</p>
                  <p n="3">

3. <hi>Creation is in an instant,</hi> on a ſuddain; and that is the reaſon why the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture <note place="margin">III. Creation is in an inſtant.</note> expreſſing Gods work in bringing about any ſuddain mercy, or ſuddain judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, calls it creation, <hi>I create light, and I create darkneſſe, Iſaiah</hi> 47. 7. What a glorious world did God make in ſix dayes? Here was a mighty alteration in a ſhort ſpace of time; and if as ſome of the Ancients ſpeak, whom <hi>Cajetan</hi> pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly argueth for, and followeth, that God made all in one day, and that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of ſix dayes is but for our capacity; if this opinion ſhould be true (as I think it far from truth, becauſe ſo expreſſely contradictory to the very letter of the Scripture,) it would much more demonſtate the inſtantaneous nature of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As Creation is thus ſuddenly, ſo this work of a new Creature is wrought very quickly in the hearts of thoſe, whom he effectually toucheth. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> of a Perſecutor, how quickly made a Proſecutor of the truth and Goſpel? Thus <hi>Zachaeus</hi> the <hi>Publican,</hi> how immediately doth he leave all and follow Chriſt? and in all inſtances of Converſion, we may wonder to ſee the ſtrange and admirable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration on a ſuddain: that as the Pſalmiſt cryed out, <hi>What aileſt thou, O Jordan, that thou turneſt back?</hi> Thus may we admire, What aile theſe men that formetly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in ſuch groſſe and prophane courſes, that now they ſhould love and delight in the contrary? Only you muſt know that although it be wrought thus ſuddenly and from nothing in us, yet God hath ordered that he will diſpenſe this grace no other way ordinarily than in the preaching of the Word, and the conſtant waiting there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Doe not thou therefore expect this Manna will fall from heaven in what place ſoever thou art in; and although thou neglect the publique Ordinances, and the means of grace. No, for although God hath not tyed himſelf to means, yet he hath tyed us to them; and therefore every time thou doeſt wilfully neglect any one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, thou knoweſt not how much thou haſt provoked God, what effectuall and <note place="margin">IV. The operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the new Creature are ſo excellent, that it muſt needs be of God only.</note> gracious operations thou haſt loſt by not being preſent.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This new Creature muſt needs be wholly of God, <hi>Becauſe it's of a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall being, and ſo the operations of it doe exceed the ſphere of naturall power;</hi> As when the Apoſtles were inabled to work miracles, it was plainly a demonſtation of Gods power with them, becauſe they did thoſe things which did wholly tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:30767:143"/>
any natural power; ſo when men love God, when they obey his commands out of upright and ſincere motives, they are inabled to doe that which wholly tranſcends the moſt refined natural abilities; It is therefore called, <hi>A participation of the divine Nature, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 4. whereby our actions have a divine ſtamp upon them; and as <hi>Sampſon</hi> when he put forth thoſe wonderful acts of ſtrength, he did it not by his naturall power, but an extraordinary aſſiſtance from God; ſo in thoſe actions of a new Creature, whereby we mourn for ſin, or delight in God, we have then more then as a man; for we pray not as a man, we hear not as a man; but God is in us, and with us.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. This new Creature muſt needs be of God, if ye do conſider, <hi>What we are till</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">V. We are the old Serpents, old Creatures, till thus new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> 
                     <hi>made ſo, even the old Creatures of the Devill;</hi> therefore <hi>the old man is ſaid to be in us;</hi> and the <hi>Devill, that old Serpent,</hi> he reigneth and ruleth in our hearts: This old houſe muſt be pulled down, ere a new one can be built. The making us new Creatures is ſometimes called a <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> now as our bodies cannot be made glorious and happy, till a great and wonderfull alteration hath been made in them, ſo neither can our ſouls be made thoſe new Creatures, till God hath wholly new moulded us, put another ſtamp upon us, and another life in us: There cannot any thing be a greater object of horror and terror to us, than the beholding our ſelves in the pure glaſſe of Gods Word; for that repreſents us ſo full of loathſomneſſe and enmity unto God; that we have cauſe to cry out, <hi>That God would waſh us, and make us whiter than ſnow:</hi> Never think with that naturall condition thou art born in, to enter into the Kingdome of heaven.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. <hi>This Creature muſt rather be made of God ſolely, than the heavens and earth;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">VI. It is a greater work than the Creation of the World.</note> for although the Scripture doth often celebrate the power and wiſedome of God, <hi>in founding the earth upon nothing, and ſtretching out the heavens;</hi> yet this Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon a mans heart, and his life, is far more wonderfull: Hence it's ordinarily ſaid, That it's a greater wonder to make a man holy and godly, then it is to create a world.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, it coſt God onely a word when he made that; <hi>Let there be light, and there was light;</hi> but ere this mercy could be purchaſed for any, Chriſt was to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come man and dye for us; ſo that God doth not onely ſpeak, but in his man-hood ſuffer; for you muſt know, as juſtification and pardon of ſinne is a fruit of Chriſts bloud, ſo is alſo this new Creation, and new making of us.</p>
                  <p>Again the excellency and glory of the heaven and earth is only in a naturall way, this in a morall way, <hi>They declare the glory of God,</hi> as <hi>paſſive objects,</hi> Theſe as <hi>active agents,</hi> and underſtanding inſtruments. If therefore the Ancient looking upon the heavens, ſaid, If theſe be thus beautifull, how beautifull is God the Maker of them? ſo may we much rather, beholding the grace and holineſſe of this new Creature, cry out and ſay, He that makes man thus holy, how holy is he? If this new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be ſo admirable, how wonderfull is the Creator of it? Hence alſo it is, that the godly are ſaid, <hi>to ſhine as lights,</hi> Philip. 2. 15 <hi>in dark places, that ſo others beholding them, may glorifie God in the day of their viſitation.</hi> If the world be thought a Book ſufficient to convince men of God, and that they ſhall be inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, becauſe they did not glorifie God as according to this knowledge; how much rather, that ſo many godly men as have lived with you, wil be a condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to you, if ye have not followed their examples? you ſhal not only give an account of that good gotten by the Sermons we preach; but of the godly life of thoſe new Creatures who have dwelt amongſt you; not onely our Sermons, but their converſations ſhould have turned you unto God.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. This work of grace muſt be wholly of God, <hi>Becauſe even in Christs humane</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">VII. The graces in Chriſts hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature were the gift of God.</note> 
                     <hi>nature, where there was a fulneſſe of it, yet it was the gift of God.</hi> The humane Nature of Chriſt, though infinitely advanced by reaſon of the hypoſtaticall union, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not God, but a Creature, could not furniſh or anoint it ſelf with thoſe rich graces he was adorned with; Therefore the Scripture ſaith, <hi>God giveth not the Spirit in meaſure to him, John</hi> 3. 34. It was given him, though it was not in meaſure;
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:30767:143"/>
now then if this new Creature of grace was wrought by God in Chriſts humane nature, how much rather muſt it be wrought in us, who are altogether polluted, when his humane nature was like the ſunne, wholly ſpotleſſe? This is a clear and an undenyable demonſtration, that God is ſole Author of this grace; That as the Sun is like an univerſall principle in regard of light, and every thing is enlightned by that, ſo is God the univerſal Fountain of all that holineſſe which is communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the godly.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. This muſt needs be Gods Creation onely, <hi>Becauſe he hath ſo abſolutely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">VIII. God hath ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed it.</note> 
                     <hi>to accompliſh it for us.</hi> All thoſe expreſſions, <hi>I will give a new heart, and write my law within thee,</hi> Jer. 31. 33. <hi>And I will take away the heart of ſtone, Ezek.</hi> 36. neceſſarily inferre that it is Gods peculiar prerogative; for if this could not be till man had conſented, and there could not be any application of grace till we had given way; Then all thoſe promiſes of God muſt be onely conditionall, expecting till man will yield alſo; and thus it would not be <hi>Predeſtination</hi> but <hi>Poſtdeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> and mans will ſhould not follow Gods, but Gods will lackey it after mans. But this cannot be thought, that God is not <hi>ſui juris</hi> in his promiſe, and that he is not able to make good by his hand, whatſoever is gone out of his mouth. Oh therefore, when thou findeſt thy heart ſo greatly aſſaulted by ſinne, and thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineſt thy luſts and corruptions are too ſtrong for thee, remember they are not too ſtrong for God.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. If this were not Gods Creature meerly, <hi>Then the greatest glory in a mans con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi>

                     <hi>and ſalvation would belong to himſelf.</hi> Certainly, if a man cannot arrogate this to himſelf, that he made himſelf a Man rather than a Toad, much leſſe can he glory in any ſuch ſtrength, whereby he ſhould difference himſelf from other men wallowing in ſinne. This differencing work of God, Chriſt himſelf reſolveth into his Fathers will; <hi>Even ſo Father, for ſo it pleaſeth thee, Matth.</hi> 11. And <hi>Paul</hi> alſo into the like cauſe, <hi>What haſt thou that thou haſt not received?</hi> and <hi>Who makes thee to differ from another? 1 Cor.</hi> 4. 7. Certainly, it's the greateſt Idolatry which God can be jealous of, to give the glory of thy new nature unto any other but himſelf; Thou doſt not indeed fall down to a ſtock and a ſtone to worſhip that, but thou doſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly put confidence, and rely upon thy own power and abilities, to procure thy own ſalvation, and inward peace.</p>
                  <p>By theſe Arguments it may appear, that whenſoever you ſee a man, of an old ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to ſin and Satan, made the Son of God and a new Creature; you may ſay, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily God was there,</hi> theſe devils and luſts have been caſt out onely <hi>by the finger of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in making his Children new Creatures, he demonſtrates ſeverall properties <note place="margin">God diſcovers many of his glorious Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the new Creature. 1.

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>His great goodneſſe and pitty to us:</hi> How often is this called his <hi>grace,</hi> and the <hi>riches of his grace.</hi> It was Gods goodneſſe to make a world, but this is the riches of his goodneſſe not to throw us away, as refuſe, fit fuell onely of everlaſting flames; It might have been with all man-kind as it was with the Devills; in their Deluge God did not provide an Ark to ſave ſo much as eight perſons, not one An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel had he compaſſion on. This grace of God is ſo deeply apprehended by the partakers thereof, that they rejoyce in it, ſpeak of it all the day long, plead for it, and that they live, or have any outward comforts is nothing to this wonderful mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God to them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>He declares his Power;</hi> That you have heard ſufficiently of, it being a <note place="margin">2.

How often have they purpoſed to leave their ſins,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:30767:144"/>
to ſet upon other duties, but ſinne is too ſtrong for them. Oh that power of God, which keeps the Sea from over-whelming the banks, that power of God, which hangs the earth upon nothing: This muſt be ſeen to turn the ſtreams of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption backward. <hi>Draw me,</hi> cryeth the Church, <hi>and I will run after thee,</hi> Cant. 1. 4. <hi>No man comes unto me, unleſſe my Father draw him,</hi> John 6. 44.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>His holineſſe is admirable herein.</hi> If a clod of earth, or piece of muck, <note place="margin">4.

                  <p>I come therefore in the next place to the ſecond thing implyed in the adjunct that qualifieth this Creature, <hi>It is a new creature,</hi> which denoteth the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency, and noble nature of it: for ſo the word <hi>New</hi> is uſed frequently in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, for that which is excellent and admirable; though here in the Text it doth eſpecially relate to an oppoſition between the <hi>Old</hi> things that formerly were done by this Regenerate perſon, and the <hi>New</hi> things he now exerciſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in.</p>

The Apoſtle in this Text tels us what is true Chriſtianity, wherein the marrow of Chriſtian Religion conſiſts, <hi>viz.</hi> Not in external duties, but in a new ſanctification of the whole man: This is the Holy of Holies, whereas duties are like the outward porch of the Temple: I ſhall proceed in this method.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. I ſhall inform you what the phraſe doth not imply. <note place="margin">What new creature doth not imply. 1. It doth not imply that there was no ſuch work be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the times of the Goſpel.</note>

                     <item>2. What it doth oppoſe.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>This expreſſion, <hi>A new creature,</hi> doth not imply</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>As if there never were ſuch a work of God in the world, before the times of the goſpel</hi> For although this phraſe be uſed in the new Teſtament, yet <hi>Shem, Enoch, Adam,</hi> after repentance, all theſe were new creatures. So that this new creation was as ſoon as ever there was any godly man in the world: It is true, the Goſpel-admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations have many prerogatives above that of the Law: hence it is called in a peculiar manner, <hi>The Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> but yet this work of God in regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating and renewing, was in that former diſpenſation as well as now, though it may be not ſo many in number were begotten unto God. Here <hi>Rachel</hi> is more fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then <hi>Leah,</hi> as I may ſo allude. Though God ceaſed from this work of Creation on the ſeventh day in reſpect of temporal objects, yet not of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. Nor</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Is this new creature ſo to be underſtood, as if it ſhould alwaies be ſuk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Not that new faith <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after.</note> 
                     <hi>after new religion, a new faith, new worſhip, and ſo ſhould every day have ſome new thing.</hi> No, but the Doctrine, the pure worſhip of Chriſt, the holy life com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the word, this new creature applyeth it ſelf to, receiveth it without any further change or alteration, though the uſe and cuſtom of it be never ſo old. Indeed when a Church is become like the Chaos at firſt, darkneſs of ignorance and prophaneneſs, ſpreading it ſelf all over; then as the Apoſtle preſſeth, 1 <hi>Cor. 3. They are to become a new lump:</hi> but when the pure Doctrine and way of God is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and imbraced, there ſtill to affect new things, is as if a man ſhould not be content with the Sun or Earth, but to deſire a new Sun and a new Earth. Though this new creature is to grow in knowledge, faith, and other graces, yet they are not to look for new things above what is written. The Scripture is like the body of the Sun, into which God hath put all light: And ſaith <hi>Turtullian</hi> well, <hi>Hoc primu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> credimus cum credimus, quod nihil ultra credere debemus,</hi> This we firſt believe, as ſoon as ever we beleeve, That the Scriptures are like <hi>Hercules</hi> his pillars with this Motto, <hi>Ne plus ultra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>This new creature is not ſo to be underſtood, as if it did make a man ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. Not that it makes a man eſſentially new</note> 
                     <hi>and eſſentially new.</hi> For a man might ask, Where is this new creature? Doth it give a new ſoul? A new body? Another kind of natural life then other men have? No, this new creation is not in reſpect of ſubſtantials, though the ſcripture calls it the New man, but onely becauſe of Accidentals. A man by this hath a new faith, new repentance, new affections, new deſires, and a new converſation; and certainly this moral change is of as great efficacy and wonder, as a naturall change. It is not therefore to be expected as if this grace of God ſhould work bodily changes, though it makes a change of the body. Thy eye is changed, thy Tongue is changed, for theſe were inſtruments of evil, but now of good.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>This new change or creature is not ſo to be explained, as if it were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. Not that it is in life onely.</note>
                     <pb n="259" facs="tcp:30767:145"/>
                     <hi>in the outward lives of men.</hi> For though it demonſtrate it ſelf there in part, yet the Choyceſt, and moſt Noble operation, is within upon the underſtanding heart, and will of a man. This new creation is moſt potent there, where it is inviſible to the bodily eye. For if this new creature were no more then an outward change in our lives, then we might finde ſuch in <hi>Plato's</hi> or <hi>Socrates,</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> School. To define a man to be a godly man by outward duties onely, is to define a man by his body, and not by his ſoul, which is the main part: though therefore thou haſt given over thy former lend and ungodly practices, yet we cannot preſently ſay, Behold, a new creature; for though all old outward things are paſſed away, yet not all old inward. Therefore the promiſe of this great work of God is primari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the heart, and inward parts of a man: and <hi>David,</hi> though totally ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating his former wickedneſs, yet cryeth out, <hi>Create in me a clean heart, Jer. 31. Pſal.</hi> 51.</p>
                  <p>Neither in the Fifth place is this new creature to be underſtood, <hi>as if there were no reliques of the old corruption in ſuch a man.</hi> As if in the deſcription of this work, <note place="margin">5. Not that no reliques of the old man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.</note> you muſt all expect to finde nothing but what is the meer work of God in you, not any thing of your old ſelves, or the old Serpent. No, although Chriſt when he cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red any man of his bodily diſeaſe, did it perfectly and preſently, yet the cure of our ſouls is by degrees, and hath much imperfection cleaving to it. There are ſome old dregs in this new wine: yea there is not any one duty, or act of Grace can be done by this new creature ſo perfectly and purely, but that ſome droſs may be found in it. <hi>Paul</hi> was a new creature, like the ſun among the ſtars, yet he found <hi>Evil preſent with him when he would do good:</hi> And this God in great wiſedome is pleaſed to do to keep us humble, and low in our ſelves; to be alwaies thirſting and panting after Chriſts grace: That as long as this flux <hi>of blood runneth,</hi> thou ſhouldeſt alwaies be deſirous <hi>to touch at leaſt the hem of his garment.</hi> This is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the godly, who many times think this mountain of grace is ſo high, that they ſhall never climb to the top of it.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond place, <hi>Let us conſider the nature of this new creature by what it op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">What the new creature is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to.</note> For when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>a new creature,</hi> he ſuppoſeth there are ſome old things to which this ſtands diametrically oppoſite. Therefore the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 17. expreſly mentioneth the generall of them, when he ſaith, <hi>Old things are paſſed away, and all things are become New.</hi> Let us therefore examine what thoſe Old things are, in whoſe room this New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>There are the old things of ſin and ungodlineſs.</hi> The glorious ſun and a <note place="margin">1. To the old things of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs.</note> dark night can as well ſtand together, as this new Creature; and thy old ſwearing, lying, thy old luſts and prophaneneſs: As ſoon as ever God works this new work upon thee, preſently thoſe old things do not onely paſs away, but are thrown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with great deteſtation: As it is ſaid of <hi>Naaman,</hi> 2 King. 5. 1. <hi>That he was a great man,</hi> a man of much eminency, <hi>but he was a leper,</hi> and till he was waſhed, he was loathſom and unclean. So may we ſay of many a great man, a rich man, a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but if an ungodly man, He is altogether unclean. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> what they were formerly, <hi>Riotous, Thieves, Unclean, Effeminate,</hi> but <hi>ye are waſhed, but ye are juſtified, but ye are ſanctified,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 11. Such black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mores muſt have their skins made white: Oh then, Why is it that ſo many who bear the glorious profeſſion of a Chriſtian, ſhould yet wallow in ſuch mire, and vomit? The Apoſtle reckons up many groſs ſins, and tels them, <hi>They ſhould not be ſo much as named amongſt them,</hi> much leſs then, practiſed, and lived in. Oh, what Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter can <hi>lift up his voice loud enough, like a trumpet, to declare unto people their tranſgreſſions.</hi> Thou art to be a new creature, a new building, Why then is there that old rubbiſh in thy life? Why is not that old houſe pulled down? Why is it that cuſtom, and the Divel, and thy wicked heart is ſtronger to keep thee in theſe bonds, then Gods word, and his Miniſtry are able to unloſe thee out of them. In
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:30767:146"/>
other things, uſe and cuſtom bringeth contempt and wearineſs, Why ſhould not then dayly ſinning make thee weary? Thoſe old luſts, that afford no new comfort, Why doſt thou not loath it at laſt? If the Iſraelites were weary of Manna, though ſo ſweet and excellent, Why ſhouldſt not thou ſay of theſe husks of ſins and ſwines draff, thou haſt enough? It were impoſſible if this new creation were in thee, thou couldſt live in, and love thoſe unlawfull pleaſures thou haſt been uſed to. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> well preſſeth that forementioned Text: <hi>Old things are paſſed away, all things are become new,</hi> as (ſaith he) <hi>Old leaves in Autumn through drineſs they wither, and fall off from the tree,</hi> there is no more ſap or juyce to maintain them. Thus when a man is regenerated, thoſe former luſts loſe their vigour and life, they have no more nouriſhment to ſupport them. Be therefore no more blind at noon day: thoſe continual and dayly luſts which thou frequently practiſeſt, demonſtrate to all the world thou art in thy old ſtate of Gall and Bitterneſs: If the fountain were ſweet, it could not ſend forth ſuch bitter ſtreams.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That old darkneſs and blindeneſs which was upon his minde, is paſſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. To old dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs &amp; blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp; new lights in the room thereof.</hi> I might inſtance in every particular of old cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption in a man, and ſhew you what a new creation there is inſtead thereof; but that would be infinite: I ſhall therefore inſtance in ſome remarkable particulars: And what is more notable then that Chaos, which is on every mans heart before converſion, Darkneſs covering the face of his ſoul, not able to diſcern any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual thing, yea to judge them folly and madneſs? What doth a man naturally more ſcorn and contemn then the practical power, and preciſe ſtrictneſs of Godlineſs? He ſeeth no lovelineſs, no Majeſty, no beauty in ſupernatural things: <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, <hi>That if an old man had the eyes of a young man, he would ſee as well as a young man, becauſe the ſoul in its own operations doth not grow old or weary, but the organ of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in an old man is more indispoſed and unfit:</hi> And we may ſay, if a natural man had the eye of a new creature, he would then ſee, judge, and diſcern as a new creature. The Apoſtle mentioneth this great alteration in men converted, Epheſ. 4. <hi>Ye were darkneſs,</hi> in the abſtract, <hi>but now ye are light in the Lord,</hi> yea its called <hi>Marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous light</hi> by <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9. For certainly that light of knowledge, faith, and ſpiritual diſcerning in a Godly man, is wonderful and admirable. So then where this new creation is, that old ſtupiditie, dulneſs, blindeneſs, knowing nothing, and regarding nothing of God, doth pals away; and now they know God, believe his word, and are filled with much delight and comfort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Therefore how canſt thou judge thy ſelf to be a new creature, whoſe right eye is put out, whoſe underſtanding is wholly darkned? Every ſermon is a riddle and parable to thee. The Bible is a book ſealed up to thee: Why is it that thou art no more carefull to get light in thy heart? How hath nature defended the eye, by pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it in an hollow place of the head, fortifying it with skins and an eyelid, and brows, as a three-fold wall to keep off any thing that may hurt it? And wilt not thou be much more deſirous to preſerve ſpiritual ſight?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>His old confidence and bold preſumption concerning his good eſtate, and Gods love towards them, that alſo paſſeth away:</hi> And inſtead thereof trembling en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth <note place="margin">3. To old pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</note> into his bowels, rottenneſs gets into his very marrow, becauſe he hath felt the terror of the Lord. There is no greater deſtructive principle of that old man in us, then that it bewitcheth a man with a ſelf-flattery, ſelf-fulneſſe, and ſelf-righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, that God loves him, that he hath a good heart, and a good God: Thus the divel keeps all things in quiet and peace, till Chriſt a ſtronger comes; but when <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> feels the burthen of her ſins, ſhe needs Chriſts comfortable ſpeech to her, <hi>That her ſins are forgiven. Davids</hi> heart roareth like the ſea, and the windes and tempeſts blowing on it, are not ſtill till God quiet them, She that thought her ſelf full, wanting nothing, now ſhe knoweth ſhe is poor, miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and naked. What a vaſt difference between <hi>Paul</hi> a Phariſee, and <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated? Then <hi>he was alive,</hi> all was well, now <hi>he is dead, and ſin kils him.</hi> If
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:30767:146"/>
thou art a New Creature, thou art loathſom, defiled in thy own eyes. Thou ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt like a Leper aloof off from all the mercies and promiſes of God. Thus God hath ordained, <hi>That none ſhould finde reſt to their ſouls, but ſuch who are loaded and burthened, Mat.</hi> 11. 22. Now thou haſt a reſt without any burthen, thou haſt an eaſe and never didſt feel a load: This is much to be ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>That old end, aim, and ſcope, to which he formerly referred all things, is now changed, and a new white is now ſet up.</hi> Every man hath ſome ultimate end <note place="margin">4. To his old ends.</note> to which he doth refer all his actions, that is, the center to which he falls. Now while a man is this old Creature, he looks no further then at earthly comforts, pleaſures, and advantages in this world: Thus they are like bruit beaſts, meaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their happineſſe by thoſe objects that do pleaſe the ſenſe: and as <hi>Eve</hi> deſired to taſt the fruit, <hi>Becauſe it was lovely to the eye;</hi> ſo do they long to taſt of that fruit which is pleaſing to their corrupt appetites: But ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Whether we live, we live to the Lord, and whether we dye, we dye to the Lord,</hi> Rom. 14. 8. <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee,</hi> ſaith <hi>David?</hi> whereas the property of every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man is deſcribed, <hi>Pſal. 4. Many ſay, Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> and the contrary diſpoſition of the regenerate ſheweth it ſelf, <hi>But Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us:</hi> So that if thou art a new creature, thy end is no longer to grow great in the world, no longer to fulfil thy brutiſh luſts, but to glorifie God, and ſave thy ſoul: And this end being earneſtly and affectionately deſired by thee, thou doſt diligently practice all thoſe means that obtain this end in praying often, in examining thy ſelf often, in humiliation, and reformation often. As the ſupreme Orb carrieth all the inferiour Orbs about with its own motion, ſo this great and noble end wheels about all thy actions; every thing is ſubſervient thereunto. Now if we would ask men, What is the great aim and end you propound to your ſelves in this world? Though with their tongue they would hapily ſay, the ſalvation of their ſouls; yet with their lives they would deny this: For if thy end be changed, the means would be changed, the way would be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged thou diſt uſe to live in.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>All his former falſe waies of worſhip and ſervice of God, they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, and now he ſerveth God after a new manner.</hi> Thus all the heathens when <note place="margin">5. To old falſe waies of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</note> they came under this New Creation, they threw away their Idols, they forſook their falſe gods; and if they were not Idolaters, but trained up in ſuperſtitious waies, and a Traditional worſhip invented by their Fore-fathers, as the Jews were, they forſook this alſo. <hi>The Kings daughter is to forget &amp; forſake her Fathers houſe.</hi> We ſee <hi>Paul</hi> ſpends much in his Epiſtles to take off the Godly from thoſe very Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances God himſelf had commanded, when the time of their abrogation was come. Not but that even this New Creature, may for want of good light and inſtruction be far plunged into ſuperſtitious and unlawful worſhips: But as the Day-ſtar ſhall ariſe in their hearts, ſo by degrees the night will wear away. <hi>What agreement hath Chriſt with Belial?</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, handling the caſe of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating with Idolaters in their Worſhip, 1 <hi>Cor. 6. Seeing they are the Temple of the Lord.</hi> It is worth the obſervation, <hi>Iſa</hi> 2. when the people of God by his heavy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon them for their Idolatry, ſhall be weary of it, it is ſaid, <hi>They ſhall throw their Idols to the Bats and Owls,</hi> that is into dark corners and holes: A fit expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for as their Idols were blinde, Eyes they had, but did not ſee; ſo they ſhall caſt them away unto blinde creatures. This ſhould make people take heed how they plead for any old thing in religion, meerly becauſe it is old; for then thou ſhouldeſt have continued in thy old popery, in thy old ſuperſtition, which many years ago thou didſt live in. Remember we are to be new Creatures in the Lord, and ſo muſt leave all old falſe wayes; though there may be <hi>the good old paths alſo that we muſt enquire after,</hi> Jer. 6. 16. when new errors have overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="262" facs="tcp:30767:147"/>
Sixthly, <hi>His old animall and natural actions, they paſſe away, and he is a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6. To old na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural actions.</note> 
                     <hi>in them.</hi> Not that he doth not eat and drink ſtill, as if he did not live after the natural way of other men: but onely a new creature over-rules all thoſe acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons after a Godly manner, inſomuch that we may ſay, it is new eating, and new drinking when this creation taketh hold of us. For in that former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>We did onely eat and drink to comfort our ſelves, to ſatisfie nature, or to pleaſe our appetite:</hi> But when regenerated, we eat and drink thereby to be enabled in our places to ſerve him, fulfilling that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</hi> Oh the exactneſſe and excellency of this new creature; it makes new eating, new drinking: now when thou drinkeſt thy ſelfe drunk, Art thou drunk to the glory of God? If grace were in thee, What an alteration would it make?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Natural men, they eat without fear,</hi> Jude 12. <hi>They do not remember their Mortality,</hi> How quickly Gods judgements may come upon them: Thoſe who were drowned in the deluge, the old world lived in this old corruption; they did eat and drink, and gave in marriage: That is, ſpent their time in the uſe of the creatures with much carnal jollity and mirth, and then the flood over-whelmed them on a ſudden. Oh there is a great deal of carnal eating and feaſting, a great deal of carnal mirth in the Creatures. But when a man is made this new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he uſeth all theſe comforts with temperance and an holy fear. <hi>I beat down my body,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul:</hi> That is, he kept himſelf in an holy ſtrict way in the uſe of all lawful comforts, that no ſpark of fire might ſuddenly break out and ſet him on fire. Thus <hi>Job, He ſacrificed unto God, and was afraid, leaſt while his ſons were feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they ſhould ſin againſt him. David</hi> prayeth about ſome, <hi>That their table might become a ſnare unto them.</hi> And certainly this is the portion of wicked men, their eating, their drinking is a ſnare to them; their mirth and jollity is a ſnare unto them: They marry, they buy houſes, oxen, and theſe things hinder them from coming to the feaſt when invited. But this new Creature is taught otherwiſe, <hi>He marrieth as if he married not, he buyeth as if he bought not, he uſeth the world as not overuſing it.</hi> And truly this work of grace is not only ſeen in caſting away the works of darkneſſe, unqueſtionable ſins; but in a gracious moderating and ordering all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful comforts.</p>

                     <hi>relations, this new creature changeth:</hi> And indeed this work of grace where it lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veneth a man, makes an alteration in a man, not onely in the general, as a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, but as a Magiſtrate, a Miniſter, an Husband, or a ſervant in any particular rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If the Heathen ſaid, He could not be <hi>Bonus vir,</hi> which was not <hi>bonus civis,</hi> not a good man in the general, who is not a good Citizen in his particular rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; How much more doth the Scripture verifie this, which doth not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct us about our duties, as Chriſtians in the general, but layeth down the ſeveral Graces of Husbands, Maſters, and Servants? So that as by it the Miniſter is <hi>Prepared for every good work, 1 Tim.</hi> 6. ſo every relation alſo is. If therefore thou art a new Creature, this will make thee a new Magiſtrate, a new Miniſter, a new Husband, a new Wife. A Magiſtrate who before looked onely to his own great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and power, <hi>Ut praeſit, non ut profit:</hi> Now he remembers he is <hi>the Miniſter of God for good to thoſe that do well, and for terrour to thoſe that do ill.</hi> He conſiders that as the ſun hath its light not for it ſelf, but the world; ſo he hath not his place and authority for himſelf, but for others: He remembers that it is <hi>Res pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica,</hi> not <hi>Res propria.</hi> Thus alſo, if a Husband, if a Maſter, he obſerveth all thoſe Relation-Duties and Qualifications commanded by the word, and looks at God in all thoſe things, which makes them called ſpirituall men; becauſe their principles, aims, and whole guidance of their ſouls in theſe things is upon higher grounds then morality can attain unto.</p>

                     <note place="margin">8. To old reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to God.</note> 
                     <hi>unto</hi> God: They doe not pray, hear, as they were wont: Not that they change theſe inſtituted Ordinances of God as they doe when they come out of Idolatry and Superſtition: But in theſe reſpects there is a great alteration made.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Whereas they thought the very externall Duties were enough to commend them to God,</hi> and upon this ground they prayed, came to Church, received Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Now they ſee they were deceived, and judge all nothing without an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward change of the heart, and an outward reformation in the life. Obſerve the Apoſtle <hi>Galatians</hi> the 5. Where having ſaid the ſame thing in the Text, <hi>That Circumciſion and uncircumciſion availeth nothing, but Faith working by love,</hi> He preſently addeth, <hi>This perſwaſion cometh not of him that calleth you:</hi> That is, this perſwaſion that external Duties are all the ſervice God requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that he looketh after no more, this doth not come from God who hath called us, for he enlightens our minds, and ſpiritualizeth our hearts to worſhip him in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and truth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>There is a glorious change alſo made in manner of theſe duties:</hi> Before he prayed and heard perfunctorily, he came after a cuſtomary manner, doing theſe duties without the ſenſe of ſin, a broken heart, and groans unutterable: but now he is fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord: ſo that a new creature leaveth not onely his former old Luſts and ſins, but his former way of performing all religious duties.</p>
                  <p>Uſe of Inſtruction, <hi>How few are new Creatures?</hi> For in how many mens lives doe you ſee their old ſins, their old luſts? Their Duties, and ſolemn Worſhip of God is done with no more fear, inward and ſpirituall deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſoul. That which thou glorieſt in, That thou art no changeling, it is thy ſhame. As this body muſt be changed er'e it can inherit immortality, and glory, ſo thy ſoul muſt be changed er'e it can come to everlaſting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. What is more miſerable then to ſee an old man with his old ſins upon him, as ignorant as he was threeſcore years ago? The ſame Oaths, the ſame Curſes as he had uſed fifty years ago: Oh thou great God of heaven, make this Truth fall like <hi>The Coal from the Altar,</hi> to touch <hi>Not their Tougnes onely,</hi> but hearts.</p>

                     <q>For in Chriſt Jeſus, neither Circumciſion, or Uncircumciſion availeth any thing, but a New Creature.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THis new Creature hath been diſcovered as it ſtands oppoſitely to thoſe old things, which the Apoſtle ſaith, are <hi>paſſed away.</hi> We come in the next place to handle it poſitively, as it is in ſenſe abſolutely conſidered; and in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, when the Apoſtle calls it a new Creature; the eſſence or being thereof is thereby declared to conſiſt in a ſupernaturality, or way of life, above that which the power of a meer man can reach unto; ſo that it is no more than a ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Creature, one, who is acted above the principles and motives of nature in all the duties he doth, ſo that the beſt way to diſcover this new Creature is, to ſhew wherein it is above the ordinary courſe of Nature: And although the School-men diſpute, wherein lyeth the true and proper notion of ſupernaturality, or what is that which makes a thing ſupernaturall, yet I ſhall not enter into that La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, this work of grace is a new Creature or ſupernaturall, <hi>in regard of its original and beginning.</hi> It doth not flow from the principles of nature: it's <note place="margin">The work of grace is a new Creature, or ſupernaturall. 1. In its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall.</note> from the power of nature that a man eateth, drinketh, laugheth or diſcourſeth; but let a man doe any thing holily, believe, or repent, to this a ſpeciall power from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is neceſſary. Indeed we need the aid and aſſiſtance of God, even to all ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary actions; Therefore the Scripture ſaith, <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our being;</hi> and God is the Author and Actuator of nature, as well as of grace; but that is a common help, this a ſpeciall help. God doth more for thee when he gives thee an heart to breath after Chriſt, then when he inableth thee to breath the breath of a naturall life; and if God be the Fountain of our naturall life, much more of our ſpirituall life. It is not enough to call a thing ſupernatural, in that it's ſolely of God, for ſo the world was created onely by him at firſt; but it muſt come from him in a peculiar and ſpeciall manner, as the author of all grace; thus every where in the Scripture, faith, repentance, love, joy, and all other graces are made a fruit of the Spirit, or the gift of God, they are not by humane power; and this ſhould make us ſenſible of our own poverty and nothingneſſe; for as often as thou heareſt the Word calling thee to believe, to repent, it doth but put thee in minde of thy utter impotency. By the Precepts a man may ſee what he ſhould doe, by the reproofs what he doth not, and by the promiſes what the grace of God doth; from this ſtock and foundation that Thou art nothing, and Grace is all, muſt the new Creature proceed. The beginnings of this is with a deep poverty of ſpirit, and apprehenſion of our inabilities. The great obſtruction in the way why thou doſt
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:30767:148"/>
not aſpire after this glorious eſtate, is becauſe thou findeſt not the need of a power from heaven to lift thee up thither: As thoſe that were blinde and lame; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired Chriſt, knowing, he onely could give them their eyes and their limbs again; ſo doe thou; O Lord, I muſt mourn for, and turn from my ſins upon holy grounds. Oh that I could doe it, how often, Lord, doe I reſolve to climb up this hill to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heaven, but I preſently fall back again; to thy power therefore, and to thy grace I flye.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſupernaturality of this Creature is ſeen <hi>in the Motives, why it ſets upon</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. In the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which ſtir it up to duty. Becauſe of God.</note> 
                     <hi>any duties,</hi> and that is, becauſe of God. Thus faith, part of the new Creature in a man, believeth Gods Word, not from cuſtome and education, or the authority of the Church, but becauſe of that divine Authority and Revelation which appeareth therein: As a man ſeeth the Sun by the light of the Sun ſhining from it. Thus the <hi>Theſſalmians</hi> received the Word of God, <hi>not as the word of man, but as of God, 1 Theſ.</hi> 2 14. This new Creature believeth the principles of Religion, <hi>Quia ipſe dixit,</hi> becauſe God hath ſaid it, not becauſe men ſay ſo: when a man aſſents unto matters of Religion no further than humane grounds lead him, it is but an humane faith, and we need not a ſpeciall gift of God to believe thus: After the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner alſo it is, when a man bewaileth his ſins, and condemneth himſelf for them, meerly becauſe of the naturall light of conſcience, not from the Word, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God is offended, but becauſe of externall judgements, this is but to move as a man, to repent as a man; whereas the Apoſtle telleth us <hi>of ſorrow after a godly manner, 2 Cor.</hi> 7 9. which is, <hi>when a ſpirit of prayer</hi> and ſupplication, and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is upon our ſouls, becauſe God is diſpleaſed with what we have done; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the greateſt, and the moſt noble part of the ſupernaturality of this new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture lyeth in this, That we goe to all divine objects upon a divine ground, upon a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine motive; ſo that it's acknowledged by all, both Papiſts and Proteſtants, that nothing can be ſaid to be graciouſly and after a godly manner done, unleſſe it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend as high as God, and be terminated on him, as the object: we are not to ſtay on <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder, but to goe up to him, who ſits at the top of it in heaven. Oh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, we may believe as men, repent as men, pray as men, hear as men, but all this while not new Creatures; becauſe theſe things are not done with a reference to God, and a complacency in him: and by this we may eaſily judge, why it's ſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a man to be taken from the wedding Feaſt, <hi>and bound hand and foot, and thrown into utter darkneſſe,</hi> I mean to be taken from religious duties, and damned, becauſe theſe were not the acts of a new Creature, but the humane devotions of a morall man. Let not therefore thy heart be quieted in any holy duties, till it be immediately applyed to God himſelf. The women that ſought for Chriſts body were not contented to ſee the Linnen in which it was wrapped, but they looked ſtill after the body; ſo neither may we reſt in the expreſſions of duties, but to go further, even to the Lord himſelf; this very point is the hinge of Chriſtianity, get this and you get all: Believe becauſe of God, mourn becauſe of God, and then you are at the higheſt of eſſentiall perfection, though not graduall. This is the onely, or at leaſt main ſpecifying difference between <hi>Judas</hi> his tears and <hi>Peters;</hi> this makes <hi>Manaſſes</hi> his humiliation good, and the want of it makes <hi>Ahabs</hi> bitter. Do not then any longer like worms crawl on the ground, but like Angels ſour up into heaven: This would make you like the Silk-worm, ſending forth that which is precious alwayes from you.</p>
                  <p>Two wayes a man may apply himſelf to God: either, Firſt, <hi>As he may be known</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A man applies himſelf to God; As re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, I. In the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> 
                     <hi>by the creatures.</hi> Of this the Apoſtle diſcourſeth much <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. for in them he revea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth his wiſdome, power and goodneſs, and ſo the Gentiles are condemned, becauſe they did not glorifie him as God; they did not goe as far as by the Moon-light of Nature they were guided: But ſuppoſe they had glorified God according to the knowledge they had of him, and did not detain the truth in unrighteouſneſſe; yet in thoſe acts they were not new Creatures, becauſe there wanted faith in God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in his Word, which is the ſoul to every action, and the Salt that ſeaſons it.
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:30767:149"/>
Therefore there is a ſecond way of the ſouls tendency to God, and that is, <hi>As he is revealed in his Word, and made known in Chriſt,</hi> being drawn unto him by his <note place="margin">II. In his Word.</note> Spirit, and ſo lifted up above all his naturall abilities, and this is the expreſſion of of a new Creature; So that what <hi>Luther</hi> prayed for <hi>Melancthon, Rapiat te De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, ex humanis in divina, è tuis in ſua,</hi> is to be powred out in the behalf of every na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man. If you ſee a <hi>Paul</hi> crucified to the world, having his Converſation in heaven, knowing how to abound, and how to want, inabled to doe all things, through Chriſt that ſtrengthens him; that his former ſinnes he once lived in, doe not ſtill ſtick cloſe to him, and damn him; you may as much wonder as they did, when they ſaw the Viper upon his hand did not kill him; and when they ſaid, The gods are come down tous in the likeneſſe of men; and <hi>Paul</hi> would return the ſame anſwer as then was, Why doe you look upon us, as if we had done theſe things by our own power? but in the name of Chriſt are they wrought. If you ſee a man walking holily, humbly, reformed from ſinne, ſay, This is the great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this ſupernaturality is ſeen, <hi>In that it is a way of ſuch perfection and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſſe,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. In that she perfection it leads to is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove natures inclination.</note> 
                     <hi>that it is no wayes agreeable to our nature;</hi> we have nor ſo much as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to it; and ſo ſupernaturall is as much as connaturall; for thus holineſſe was not ſupernaturall to <hi>Adam,</hi> but it was a fit and ſuitable qualification, even as rationality and riſibility was connaturall to his ſoul: ſo God creating <hi>Adam</hi> for ſuch a glorious end as to enjoy him, holineſſe was a connaturall perfection due to him; but now ſince our lapſed-and polluted condition, all holineſſe is ſo far ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall, that it is againſt our natures, we have no inclination to that which is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; yea, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We have enmity againſt the way of God, and we neither are, or can be ſubject to it, Rom.</hi> 8. Godlineſſe is a kind of violence to our corrupt natures; and therefore we are ſaid to crucifie, and mortifie ſin, yea to deny our ſelves; all which argueth the repugnancy that is in us to that which is holy; won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der not then, if men be ſo unwilling, ſo untoward to be brought to this work of grace: There is a ſecret enmity, and antipathy in us to it; we love it no more than the thief doth the light; and upon this is grounded all that rage, hatred and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition they have againſt godly wayes: They cannot give you a good reaſon why? onely their hearts are full of venome againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, this ſupernaturality may be ſeen, <hi>in that proportion and analogie it hath</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. In its ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy with God.</note> 
                     <hi>with God,</hi> though with a vaſt difference. We call Gods Wiſdome, power, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe ſupernaturall, becauſe it tranſcends the ſphere of the Creature, though to God it be natural; ſo Chriſts power to work miracles was natural to him, though ſupernaturall to us: Now in this new Creature there is a rude draught, and ſome imperfect lineaments of this; <hi>Be yee holy as I am holy; and he purifieth himſelf, even as God is pure.</hi> As God loveth all things, and doth all things to the glory of God, ſo doth this Creature refer all to him, it liveth wholly to him; and as all the ſtreams empty themſelves into the ſea, ſo doe they all their glory, welfare and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage into the honour of God. As all comes from him, ſo they return all to him: Thus they alſo learn of Chriſt, who is the treaſure of all ſupernatural perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, not onely his miracles, but his graces were above our humane ſtrength; His Patience, his meekneſſe, his humility, his zeal, his obedience to the death: all theſe demonſtrated him to be the Son of God; and therefore in this we are to ſhew his image and likeneſſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the next place let us conſider the qualities and properties of this new Creature;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The Qualities and properties of the New-Creature. 1. A partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the divine nature.</note> 
                     <hi>and firſt the excellency and perfection of it is very obſervable, it being a participation of the divine Nature,</hi> as <hi>Peter</hi> ſtiles it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 4. and hereby we are like not Angels but God himſelf. The Schoolmen do ordinarily determine, that grace is more noble and perfect than any Creature: neither the Sun, or the Heavens, or any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the World is comparable to it; for they have onely a naturall perfection, this a morall: Yea grace in the ſoul, they ſay, is more excellent and noble than the ſoul it ſelf; and if the ſoul of a man be more worth than a thouſand worlds, what
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:30767:149"/>
is grace in that ſoul worth; and the reaſon why grace is a more noble thing than any other Creature, is, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith well: <hi>In illis tantum ſunt opera a Des, in hâc eſt imago dei;</hi> look upon the glorious Sunne, in it is onely the work of God; but look upon grace, and in it is the Image of God; ſo that as we ſay, <hi>Non-poteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquid eſſe melius Deo,</hi> Nothing can be better than God, ſo neither can any thing be better than grace the image of God. If therefore this be true, that this now crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is more perfect than any other Creature, no marvail if the wiſe man ſay, Riches and Pearls are not to be compared to it; And although this new Creature be an accident, and the ſoul a ſubſtance, and ſo <hi>in modo eſſendi,</hi> in the manner of being, it is more imperfect than the ſoul; yet becauſe it's an accident that floweth not from the ſoul, as an effect from the cauſe, but is cauſed by an efficient of a more eminent nature, therefore it is more noble than the ſoul it ſelf. As you ſee the light, though it be an accident, yet is more glorious than the aire in which it is, becauſe it cometh from the Sun a more glorious body than the aire: ſo that the meaſure of every things perfection, is the near or remoter participation of God, and this new Creature bringeth a man to the neareſt participation of God of any Creature. We are not like God in being Rich, Great, Noble, Honoured, but in being holy; and the perfection and nobleneſs of this Creature is herein unqueſtion ably ſeen; becauſe the promiſe of ſalvation and eternall life is made onely to this. An Angel hath not eternall glory becauſe he is an Angel made of ſuch a glorious nature, but becauſe he is holy. And the ſoul of a man, though it be immateriall, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, and hath many perfections, yet ſalvation and happineſſe ſhall not be given to it becauſe it is a ſoul: though it be worth more than a world, yet it is not worth an heaven, but becauſe it is found in the life of this new Creature, though even it then be alſo of grace; becauſe this new Creature is not made perfect in this life.</p>
                  <p>Again, this new Creature muſt be more noble than any other Creature, becauſe it prepareth and fitteth us for a more noble end and being (I ſpeak not of merit, but of the order God hath appointed) ſo that it doth not qualifie a man as a man; in which ſenſe Learning, Prudence, and other politicall abilities doe, but as one who by it may enjoy and have Communion with God himſelf; but though it be thus excellent, we muſt not lift it ſo high, as if thereby we were juſtified and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God through any inherent worth thereof.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, from this excellency cometh another quality, which is <hi>Beauty and lovelineſſe,</hi> to be deſired by all. Oh if thy eyes were not blinded, thou wouldſt ſee <note place="margin">2. Deſirable beauty and lovelineſſe.</note> every thing in the world to be contemned, that this may be obtained. No wonder if the man in the Parable, <hi>ſold all he had to get this Pearl:</hi> no wonder if <hi>Solomon</hi> doth ſo commend this new Creature under the name of <hi>Wiſdome,</hi> and exhorteth to take pains for this rather than for other things. Oh that the preaching about it might beget love in you to it, deſires after it, ſaying, I take pains for wealth, to live in this world, but there is a more noble good than all theſe things below: Let me not be ſatisfied till I be made a new Creature. If duties doe not avail without this, can wealth or greatneſſe profit without it? Shall the devill think, that the ſhewing of the glory of the world may tempt men to worſhip him; and ſhall not the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this glory make thee willing to worſhip God?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The neceſſity of this:</hi> If thou art not a new Creature, thou art miſerable in all fulneſſe. Thou art not a wiſe man indeed till thou art a new Creature. Hence <note place="margin">3. Neceſſity.</note> the Scripture commends this under the Title of Wiſdome, and calls every wicked man a fool. Whatſoever parts and abilities thou maiſt have, yet thou art not wiſe til thou art thus made new: for a wiſe man, <hi>ſapiens ſapit res prout ſunt,</hi> judgeth of things as they are. The child thinketh Copper is Gold, and thus while thou art not this new Creature, thou judgeſt earthly temporary comforts, which are but for a ſeaſon, which will dye with thee, to be the only good to be laboured for. He is a wiſe man that judgeth earthly things as earthly, but eſteemeth heavenly things as heavenly. Again, he is a wiſe man that prevents after-wiſhes. <hi>Non putabam,</hi> I did not think it, is the portion of a fool; therefore God cannot repent, becauſe he fore-ſeeth
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:30767:150"/>
alwayes what is to be done. When <hi>Tully</hi> ſaw <hi>Pompey</hi> was overcome, whoſe ſide he favoured, and <hi>Caeſar</hi> prevailing, he cryeth out, <hi>O miſeram ſenectutem, O me nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam ſapientem;</hi> He is now full of miſerable wiſhes, becauſe he did not fore-ſee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents. Now this new Creature, if we alwayes follow the direction and inclination thereof, we ſhould never cry out, Oh that I had done otherwiſe, Oh that I had lived nother life: Then ſhal I not be confounded, when I have reſpect to all thy Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1 19. The ſweetneſſe of this new Creature will be ſeen when you come to dye. Oh how happy will it then be to think, I doe not repent of my pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of my ſtrict ſerving of God; though I denyed my ſelf much unlawfull plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, yet now I am full of lawful and good joy. Again, Wiſdome is to lay up to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, when reſolutions to alter will be too late. Now onely this new Creature layeth up treaſure for eternity. Oh if men would look upon ſin now, as the damned in hell look on it; if it were as terrible to you now, as it is to thoſe that are roaring in Hell, how quickly would men ſay to their ſins, Be gone?</p>
                  <p>As the new Creature is thus onely wiſe, ſo this only is true riches, true wealth; <hi>rich in faith,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. And <hi>Laodicea</hi> was poor, though abounding in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fulneſſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. It was the Stoicks Poſition, That the wiſe man is only a rich man. To be ſure, it is the Scriptures truth, That this new Creature is only a rich Creature, for he only hath God the Fountain, he only hath the promiſe: all things are his, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. This is better than the Philoſophers ſtone, which is ſaid to turn all into Gold.</p>
                  <p>Again, This onely is true peace, happineſſe and comfort: Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>As many as walk after the rule, peace on them.</hi> Where this new Creature is not, there is no true peace, no true joy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>  they may in the midſt <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

If then onely wiſdome, onely riches, onely joy be in this new Creature, how is it, that men ſeek not after it in the firſt place? why is it not the firſt thing that all people begin with?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, As the neceſſity of it is conſiderable, ſo another quality obſervable, is, <note place="margin">4. Strictneſſe and Exactneſs.</note> 
                     <hi>the exactneſſe and ſtrictneſſe of it:</hi> For you heard that this new Creature doth not onely make a man forſake his old ſins, and ſo he is a new man then, but it new mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and ſtampeth all his lawfull actions and comforts; it keeps a man exactly to his bounds, ſo that the water doth not over-flow the banks leſt it get ſoil; he loveth, but not over-loveth; It ſets the heart of a man like a Watch, to ſtrike when, and no more than, it ſhould. Hence the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>Walking exactly and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly, Epheſ.</hi> 5. 14. ſo that from this exactneſſe, neceſſarily floweth a ſingularity, as to the common cuſtomes and ways of the world: you deſpiſe men for their ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, for ſingularity; this argueth your ignorance of grace, for this new Creature neceſſarily makes a man ſingular; as to wicked and worldly men, <hi>Matth. 5. What ſingular thing do ye? Doe not even the Heathens and Publicans the ſame?</hi> ſo that although a vain proud ſingularity be a part of the old Creature, and a plain demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of pride and folly, yet a godly ſingularity is a fruit of this new Creature; he doth not ſuch things, as wicked men do, as naturall men doe, as he himſelf once did; ſo that every man is bound to be ſingular in this ſenſe, elſe he cannot be a new Creature.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>This new Creature is endowed with a fittedneſſe and preparedneſſe for every</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5. Preparednes for every good work.</note> 
                     <hi>good work;</hi> ſo that thereby there is an univerſall inclination to every good way: Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Eph. 2. 20. We are his workmanſhip, created to every good work.</hi> As e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very creature is by Gods providence furniſhed with powers and faculties ſutable to thoſe actions and operations which belong to them; ſo is this new Creature accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated with all thoſe principles that may induce him to ſuch a life as is anſwerable thereunto, ſo that what is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>A body thou haſt prepared for me,</hi> is true, both of ſoul, and body in this new creature. Now this preparedneſſe of heart for every duty and grace, is of infinite concernment; for without this the duty miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and the heart is not eaſily put into an inſtrumentall fitneſſe for Gods glory;
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:30767:150"/>
there muſt be much cutting, and ſawing, and hammering, ere the heart be a poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtone in Gods building.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>This new Creature being wholly of God, both in the nature and operations</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6. A man needs not bring it down to him, but it elevates a man to it.</note> 
                     <hi>of it, doth elevate and lift up a man to it,</hi> ſo that a man is not to bring that down to him; <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; and, <hi>He that is born of God, cannot ſin;</hi> and hence it is, that <hi>Paul,</hi> with all new Creatures doth not conſult with fleſh and bloud in their duties, but with Gods Word, the Law and Rule of this new Creature; ſo that it is a thing which the new Creature abhorreth, to make uſe either of grace it ſelf, or the opinion of it, to bring about any wicked thing; for as the Load-ſtone draweth the Iron, not the Iron the Load-ſtone, ſo grace doth draw and move the heart of a man after it, and man is not to make that follow him, grace being a new Creature; and ſo of God, it lyeth not in mans power to make what he will grace. The Magiſtrate is called, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>This new Creature is wondred at, and deſpiſed in the world,</hi> As the ſhadow alwayes followeth the Sun, ſo do reproaches ſlander this new Creature: it is like the ſpeckled bird among the Creatures, as the Scripture deſcribeth the Church; <hi>They think it ſtrange,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that they run not into the ſame exceſſe of riot with you,</hi> for it's a life that is contrary to theirs, and ſo cannot ſtand together any more than the Ark and Dagon; But how deſpicable and miſerable ſoever in the eyes of the world, yet of glorious account with God. It is with this Creature, as with all ſtrangers, hated and deſpiſed; and like Chriſt himſelf, not having where to lay his head: but if thou art a new Creature, though in an old priſon, in old rags, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but outward ruines, thou art indeared to God.</p>

For 1. This is the very neceſſary ingredient in our converſion and turning to <note place="margin">1</note> God: For in that thou art not admitted to pardon and conſolation, either God muſt be blamed, or thou muſt be blamed: ſeeing God was an adverſary to thee, and thou an enemy to him, the fault is ſomewhere, and either God muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (I ſpeak with reverence) that he hath done ill to threaten thee, to afflict thee, to break thee, or thou muſt confeſſe the blame lyeth upon thee. Now it would be blaſphemy to charge God ſo fooliſhly; but it is piety to charge thy ſelf heavily; and what do the words <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Repent,</hi> or be wiſe after the fact? but imply that thou haſt been fooliſh, and out of thy wits all the while thou livedſt in ſuch ungodly courſes; ſo <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, admonition, which the ungodly man is with all readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to receive, is as much as putting a mind, an underſtanding in a man, as if a man were a beaſt before, and when he is converted, God breaths a rational ſoul into him again, at leaſt gives a ſanctified, and right uſe of reaſon. Again the word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, Converſion, doth it not ſuppoſe an averſion, or a turning away from God? So that the reaſon thou bringeſt againſt this change, is moſt for it. <hi>Goliah</hi> is cut off with his own ſword: Thou pleadeſt if thou art a new Creature, thou muſt condemn all thy former life, all thy by-paſt converſation: very good reaſon; For how is it repentance elſe? How is it converſion elſe? Neither is this ſuch diſhonour, for God onely cannot repent becauſe of his infinite perfection, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no ignorance in his underſtanding, or mutability in his will, which are the grounds of repentance: But as for man naturally corrupted and defiled, he is <hi>Ad ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil aliud, quam paenitentiam natus,</hi> Born, at leaſt new regenerated to do nothing but repent of his former converſation. Do not then think with thy ſelf, If I leave my old life, my former courſes, I ſhall confeſs a blame upon my ſelf. Alas, in this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing lieth the great work of a new creature; in this particular thou art often to excerciſe thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Stick not at this to ſhame and condemn thy former life: For this is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">2.</note> neceſſary qualification for thy admſſion into grace. Thou muſt come with a ſacrifice of atonement if thou wilt be accepted: That is, Chriſts blood which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhed for thoſe that feel themſelves loſt. If we confeſſe our ſins, is often the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition expreſſed, for the Scepter of Grace to be held out to us, <hi>Levit. 5. 5. 1 John</hi> 1. 9. And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, If we would judge our ſelves, we ſhould not be judged of the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. And <hi>David, He confeſſeth and bewaileth his folly, that God may be juſtified and cleared when he is judged,</hi> Pſalm 51. God will receive a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can, not a Phariſee. If thou giveſt glory to God, by judging thy own ways, clearing him, though he ſhould damn thee, this is the moſt compendious way to obtain grace. <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith, <hi>Some heathens in their ſupplications to their gods, would not carry either Gold, or Iron, or a ſtaff into the Temple with them, but lay all aſide when they went to pray,</hi> to ſignifie they did not truſt in earthly wealth or greatneſs, but Gods goodneſs and power only. And thus it ought to be in our ſpiritual ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to the true God, we muſt lay aſide our own righteouſneſs, and go to Chriſt, as the menſtruous woman who had ſpent all ſhe had upon Phiſitians, yet could not be cured: Oh therefore be ſo far from fearing this duty, that rather thou wilt forwardly offer thy ſelf thereunto: ſay the way to get honour and praiſe with God, is to diſhonour my ſelf, and magnifie him. His mercy in pardoning, his grace in forgiving, will be ſo much the more admirable, by how much unworthy and vile I am in my own eyes.</p>

Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>When he was a child, he spake as a child, but when a man, as a man.</hi> Thou wilt ſay, When I was a beaſt, I lived as a beaſt, but ſince a new creature, as a new Creature. <hi>What profit have you of thoſe things whereof yee are now aſhamed?</hi> Rom. 6. 21.

of old and be troubled: See how are <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>David</hi> affected with the ſins of their youth; yea godly men are ſo far from fear of condemning themſelves from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſins, that when their ſins have been ſcandalous to the Church of God, they have acknowledged, and bewailed them in the publick aſſemblies: And this was that publick confeſſion of ſin and penance, which afterwards by popiſh Doctrines was ſo corrupted. If any of the Church had been overtaken by a foul ſin, they had no peace in their hearts till they had thrown themſelves down in the publick aſſemblies, crying out with him, <hi>Calcate me inſipidum ſalem,</hi> Tread upon me as unſavory ſalt; No leſs wouldeſt thou do, if the glory of God, and the edification of the Church did require it for thy own ſinful waies. Know therefore, that this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing thy ſelf, is but ſo much accuſing of thee with God. Thou art afraid to be thought a new man, that thou haſt done amiſſe heretofore: Oh if thou wert truly wrought upon, all the world could not make thee keep in thoſe accuſations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictments which thou makeſt againſt thy ſelf daily at Gods tribunal.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>A new creature ſticks not at this ſelf-condemnation, becauſe thoſe former wayes</hi>

                     <hi>repented of, are uſed as an advantage by him to ſet up the praiſe and glory of God in ſhewing mercy to him.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> he is often willing to make mention of all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer impieties, that ſo the grace of God may be made the more illuſtrious; and this is one reaſon why you have the ſins of the Godly recorded in the Scripture to all eternity as it were. <hi>Noahs</hi> drunkenneſſe, <hi>Moſes</hi> his unbelief, <hi>Aarons</hi> baſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance in Idolatry, <hi>Davids</hi> Adultery and Murther, <hi>Peters</hi> Abjuration of Chriſt, not to defame them, but to have perpetual monuments of Gods grace &amp; goodneſs to them. Thus the Apoſtle when he would ſtir up the Epheſians and others to thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and to admire the riches of Gods grace to them, he puts them in minde of their former converſation what they were once, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. and this they did not take ill, as a matter of upbraiding of them, but as a whetſtone to ſharpen their thankfulneſſe. Why then ſhouldſt thou be afraid to confeſſe thy ſelf once out of the way? ſeeing this will make for Gods grace, which left the ninety nine ſheep, and fetched thee home upon its ſhoulders who was gone aſtray.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond <hi>Scarcrow that men pretend againſt this new creature is, That hereby they</hi>

                  <p>To Anſwer this, conſider it is no new thing for many men to be ſuch fooliſh <note place="margin">Anſ. 1</note> maſter builders in matters of religion, as that all muſt be taken down again; there is nothing more ordinary then to have ſome crack in the foundations: our Saviour doth fully clear this, when he ſpeaks of one who built upon the ſand, the winds blew, and tempeſts aroſe, <hi>and then the fall of that houſe was great,</hi> Mat. 7. 26. Thus alſo the Apoſtle chargeth the <hi>Galatians, Have ye ſuffered ſo many things in vain,</hi> Gal. 2. So that it is very ordinary for a people to go on many years in a rode of religion; and in the practice of holy duties, yet they do all theſe things in vain: All muſt be undone and a better foundation laid. If thou haſt built hay and ſtuble, the fire will conſume it all at laſt: Do not therefore do in thy ſpiritual condition, as bankrupts uſe to do in their temporal, never care to look to their accounts, afraid to conſider of their debts, but ſtill hope to rub it out, till at laſt all be too late: So many a man hath inwards thoughts and fears that his eſtate is not right, that this will never hold when he comes to account, but he is unwilling to dwel in his thoughts upon theſe things.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As this is ordinary, ſo we have plain inſtances in Scripture of men accuſtomed <note place="margin">2.</note> a long time in the way of religious duties, yet this hath been earneſtly urged to them to become New: <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a teacher in Iſrael, and ſo of long ſtanding, and acquainted with the Scripture, in prayer often, yet unleſſe he be born again, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the Kingdom of heaven, <hi>John</hi> 3. And thus all thoſe Jews that were converted by <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, by Chriſt and the Apoſtles Miniſtry, they were all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in that outward worſhip of God he had commanded, but by their preaching they ſaw a neceſſity of being born again: And this is the moſt happy, and neceſſary

If it be found that thou haſt thus many years come to Church in vain, not laid good foundations, and right principles, this is the moſt dangerous vanity of all: for to take pains in vain about temporall things, is but an outward momentary loſs; but to pray in vain, to hear in vain, is a ſpiritual and eternal loſs: Its an happineſs for a traveller to know betimes that he is out of the way; but if he ſhould travel the whole day in unſeaſonable ſharp wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and dangerous rodes, and then at night be told he is clear out of the way, What ſad tydings would it be to him? And thus it is here: if a man ſhould live for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or threeſcore years in many ſad exerciſes, and outward miſeries, and when he comes to dye be truly told, Oh ſir, you are quite out of the way to heaven, you have been travelling to hell this many years: How muſt he cry out, Oh why did not I think of this before? Why did I not know it before?</p>

                     <hi>or to ſuppoſe it naught, would plunge us into despair:</hi> to that there are ſeveral An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It argueth ignorance of the breadth, and depth of Original corruption to <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> argue ſo: Thou forgetteſt in what ſtate thou art born, and how unclean thou art by natural propagation; otherwiſe if this were acknowledged, thou wouldſt eaſily ſee that there is a neceſſity of being born again: What, thou wert not born with the image of God upon thy ſoul, Thou wert not born a Childe of Grace, but of wrath: <hi>As this corruptible body muſt put on incorruption, e're it can be made glorious,</hi> ſo this defiled ſoul muſt put on purity e're it can be made happy in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. So that there is a neceſſity upon thee to conclude, That thou art wholly in ſin, and ſhut up under wrath; thou muſt ſee thou art undon: And from hence it is that men deſire not more this New Creature: they think their old life will ſerve. They perceive not the Ruines that are on their ſouls, and by this means reſt contented, though in an undone eſtate.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Thou who art afraid of despairing, if all be found naught in thee, conſider that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>it is neceſſary thou ſhouldſt despair and have no hope or ſtay in thy ſelf, or any thing thou doſt.</hi> For thoſe loaden and burthened ones, who are invited to come to Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. can find no reſt or eaſe in themſelves till they come to him: Inſomuch that none are further off from grace and mercy, then thoſe who juſtifie themſelves, as the Phariſees did. It is true, through the ſenſe of ſin to deſpair of the grace of Chriſt offered, and to neglect that ſalvation, is a crimſon ſin, and immediately oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the Goſpel; but to deſpair of our ſelves, and to have no hope in what we do, is a neceſſary qualification, and hereby we give glory to God; and therefore if we did deſpair more in our ſelves, our condition would be leſſe deſperate: And this is the condemnation of men, that they preſume in the mercy of God, and bleſſe themſelves in their hearts, when yet there is but a ſtep between them and hell.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>It is better deſpairing here with hopes, then despairing here after without any the</hi>

in hell be a New Creature upon any terms, whatſoever it coſt him, if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible? But we are fooliſh, like ſome fooliſh, infirm, and wounded perſon, who will not diſcover his wounds, nor make known his grief till it be too late: Lay it therefore home upon thy heart, and ſay, If I am afraid of the ſight of ſin here, What ſhall I do with it hereafter? If a ſpark be thus heavy and ſcorching, What will the whole flames be? Oh, but men are never wiſe till it be too late. <hi>Dives</hi> when he is in hell, then his eyes are opened, and he bewaileth his condition. Be aſſured of this, that God hath unchangeably decreed, thy ſins ſhall be bitter to thee here, or hereafter. The word is gone out of his mouth, and it cannot be recalled: thou ſhalt either glorifie him by a voluntary confeſſion, or by an extorted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained one hereafter: Therefore do not feed thy ſelf with vain hopes, as if thou ſhouldſt never find ſin with a ſting: no, at laſt it will bite like an Adder, and ſting like a Scorpion, if it do not in this life.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly remember, <hi>That trouble and pain which may be for a while in the pangs of this New creature, will be abundantly recompenſed with the after joy and quietneſſe</hi>

                     <hi>thou wilt have. Rejoyce in the Lord, ye upright in heart, and the Godly rejoyce with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 8. Thou canſt not imagine what ſweet peace, and comfort of heart it will bring to thee, to think that once indeed thou waſt captivated to ſuch and ſuch ſins, but now thou haſt broken thoſe ſnares. <hi>Paul</hi> once a bitter adverſary to the wayes of God, How much doth he rejoyce in the change made upon him? How often doth this New Creature cry out with gladneſs and thanks-giving, he would not for a world be as once he was? If he might have all the glory on earth, he would not live as he hath lived: And thus we have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled that objection, grounded upon a three-fold abſurdity.</p>
                  <p>A Fourth Objection, or Obſtruction againſt this New Creature, <hi>Is the ſtrictneſs and ſingular exactneſs of it.</hi> Not onely groſs ſins to be caſt away, but even all lawful affections to be moderated, and dieted: They muſt not do as the world, not live as the world: this is to put themſelves into a miſery, as he ſaid, <hi>Qui medicè vivit, miſere vivit,</hi> becauſe he muſt be ſo temperate, and abſtemious in thoſe things to which his appetite carrieth him. Now this cavill is wholly unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: for</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Thy very Chriſtianity, and the profeſſion of it, carrieth thee not to do as men of the world doth.</hi> So that thou muſt either lay aſide thy chriſtianity, or elſe be <note place="margin">1.</note> exact in thy life, and ſingular to the manners of the world. The Church of God is compared to a woman clothed with the Sun, <hi>and the moon under her feet,</hi> Revel. 12. 7. Doth not the Apoſtle exhort us, <hi>Not to be faſhioned unto the world,</hi> Rom. 12. 1. We are not to have their faſhion upon us: And why are we called a Church, but becauſe we are called out of the world, and ſo have not our converſation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the principles thereof? And the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> calls it <hi>Pure religion, and undefiled, to keep our ſelves unſpotted from the World,</hi> James 1. 17. If therefore drunkenneſſe, luſts, pride, earthlineſſe, immoderate affections to theſe things below, be things of the world, thou art no more to conform to them, then light to dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and howſoever the world accounts thoſe men of the beſt faſhion, who are rich, great, and honoured, yet the Scripture ſaith, <hi>they are of the beſt faſhion,</hi> who are not faſhioned to the manners of the world: by this argument thou ſhouldeſt ſtill lie in thy Paganiſme, and Heatheniſme; For why ſhouldſt thou come out of the world in reſpect of thy faith, and not alſo in reſpect of thy life? Thou wouldeſt have a better faith then infidels, Why not alſo a better life? Anſwer that, if thou canſt, God hath not only called us to imbrace his Doctrine, but unto holineſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Thou complainest this is an exact ſtrict way, full of difficulties:</hi> Is it not true this of every good thing? Is there any good thing either natural or moral to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <note place="margin">2.</note> without much labour? ſo that the difficulty makes for the excellency of it: Strive to enter in at the ſtraight Gate, <hi>Luke 13. 14. For the way to deſtruction is a broadway.</hi> You cannot get ſo much as the bread and food of your bodie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſweat of your brows: and think you to get the ſalvation of your ſouls ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily:
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:30767:154"/>
Learning cannot be obtained without great pains and ſtudy: <hi>Sudavit &amp; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit,</hi> ſaith he: If therefore this new creature be ſo difficult and rare, ſo hardly to be obtained, then thou haſt the greater reaſon to preſſe the more about it. Thou art to fear the way thou walkeſt in is too broad a way: Thou muſt be a <hi>Jacob</hi> wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, before thou canſt be an Iſrael prevailing: You muſt run in a race, e're you can obtain a Crown: and indeed that Crown of glory is ſo rich and glorious, that theſe are but <hi>ſiliquae laboris,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> called them, the husks of labour in reſpect of that Manna hereafter.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Thou complaineſt of labour and paines, if thou doſt obſerve it, every man takes</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>more pains to go to hell.</hi> A ſervant to ſin is a far greater ſlave and drudge, then a ſervant to righteouſneſs. Take the Adulterer, How doth he watch for the twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light? How full of fears and hopes to accompliſh his luſts: Take the Ambitious man, How doth he break his ſleep, toil his mind, and conſumeth himſelf to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his deſigne? Take the covetous earthly man. How is his ſoul pierced through with many cares? And how doth he drown himſelf in thoughts and fears about his eſtate? So that thy ſervice in the wayes of Godlineſs would be far more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, quiet, and profitable, then thoſe of ſin and Satan. It is a known ſtory of <hi>Pambo,</hi> who ſeeing a ſtrumpet taking pains about the dreſſing her ſelf to pleaſe her Mate, cryed out and ſaid, <hi>He could not take as much pains to pleaſe God;</hi> and this will appear true; men take more pains, are more turmoiled in going to hell, then they may be in going to heaven.</p>

What names were given Chriſtians by way of contempt? And if the faith of Chriſt be ſubject to perſecution, yet thou dareſt not Apoſtatize from that, Why then from the power of Godlineſſe, though ſubject to troubles? How often doth the Scripture forwarn us in this reſpect? <hi>That we are not to think the fiery try all ſtrange,</hi> 1 Pet. 4. 12. <hi>And we are to know that we are appointed to all afflictions and troubles in this world,</hi> 1 Theſ. 3. 3. This demonſtrateth the excellency of a New Creature: For if it were of the world, <hi>the world would love it as his own,</hi> John 15. 19.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Theſe troubles and perſecutions are not a miſery, if rightly apprehended, but</hi>

                     <bibl>GAL. 6. 15.</bibl>
                     <q>For in Chriſt Jeſus neither Circumciſion nor uncircumciſion availeth any thing, but a New-Creature.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>I Shall now finiſh this Diſcourſe about a new Creature: we have handled the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, and its properties; I ſhall in the laſt place <hi>ſhew you the counterfeits of this new Creature,</hi> or what that is which ſeemeth to be this new Creature, and yet is not. There is nothing wherein a man doth oftner deceive himſelfe than in this. If the queſtion ſhould be put to every man, Whether he be a new Creature, or not? He would anſwer affirmatively, And thank God he is: It is therefore good to demonſtrate it ocularly and palpably, that there are many things which have the vizar and form of this new Creature, but they want the power of it; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to have the ſhew, name and title of it, is eaſie; but to put forth the powerful operations of it, is burdenſome and difficult: In the number therefore of theſe Counterfeits, are,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>All thoſe who have the outward forme and ſhape of godlineſſe, but are wholly deſtitute of the inward efficacy and power of it.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Having a form of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Who ſeem to be born again, but are not.</note> 
                     <hi>godlineſſe, but denying the power of it, 2 Tim</hi> 3. 5. The Greek word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by a Form, Image, or Similitude; As if you ſhould ſay, the Picture or Statue of a man, it is not a man: Thus it is here, there are many who have the outward faſhion and expreſſion of godlineſſe, but they have not the reality of it, which is here in the Text called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, virtue or power, becauſe the true nature of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is diſcerned by its operations, a picture doth not ſpeak, nor walk, nor grow, becauſe it's onely the form of a man. Now this outward profeſſion might ſeem to put in fair for this new creature; for look upon him as a Chriſtian, ſo he is one who hath renounced the Idols of the world; he is one that comes out of the wilderneſſe he once lived in: If you compare him and an Heathen together, doth not one ſeem to be a new Creature in reſpect of the other? But this externall new change is not enough. <note place="margin">Why an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form of godlines with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inward ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of it, &amp;c.

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe as you have heard, The greatest work of this new Creature is in the heart,</hi> called therefore the hidden man, and the inward man. It is not ſo much a new Tongue to profeſſe a new worſhip of God, as a new Minde, a new Will, new Affections: for look where the old man had his greateſt Hold, and his ſtrongeſt

Fort, there this new man cometh and poſſeſſeth it. Now the ſtrength of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lyeth in our mindes and hearts; there is the Treaſury and Shop of ſin: It's from the heart (ſaith our Saviour) that evill Thoughts, Adulteries, Murders, and all wickedneſſe doth flow, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 21. Then on the contrary, when a man is made a new Creature, from his heart come good thoughts, holy affections, and a godly converſation. Doe not then judge according to outward appearance, thou muſt not onely look to what fruit thy life bears, but what root that is from whence it groweth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>This outward form cannot be the new Creature, becauſe the Apoſtle in the Text</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">II.</note> 
                     <hi>makes it contradistinct, and an oppoſite; or at leaſt a diverſe member to that of a new Creature.</hi> For when he ſaith, Circumciſion availeth nothing, he meaneth the whole external form of the ſervice of God in the old Teſtament, when he ſaith un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſion availeth nothing, he meaneth the whole externall form of the worſhip of God in the new Teſtament. Now to both theſe is contradiſtinguiſhed this new Creature: ſo that if a man have all the poſtures and outward forms of the Chriſtian Religion, and godlineſſe profeſſed therein, yet he hath not oyl, he hath only lamps, and when the voice of the Bride-grooms coming will be heard, he wil fall into mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable confuſion: Why is it then, that men reſt in forms and externall ſhews, as if that were all God required, as if there were no further thing requiſite?</p>

As it holds true of that ſin, ſo we may ſay; If any man be a drunkard, lyar, ſwearer, Sabbath-breaker, he hath denyed his faith, and is worſe than an Infidel. But why worſe than an Infidel? Becauſe he ſinneth againſt more light and knowledge, as alſo againſt more holy obligations and bonds which are in the Chriſtian Religion. Know therefore that a titular Chriſtian, but a reall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane man; a nominall believer, but a reall ungodly perſon, is like old Sepulchers, with new guilding and painting over them; like a Statue of earth and dirt, with ſome glorious colouring; and as if a man ſhould goe to touch and feel what ſuch a Statue is, it would preſently turn to dirt and duſt in his hand: ſo if thou wouldſt ſeriouſly lay to heart thy condition, that which thou hopeſt in, and boaſteſt of, thou wouldſt finde to be empty and vain: reall ungodlineſſe and prophaneneſſe under the form of Chriſtian profeſſion, is groſſe and palpable hypocriſie; and it's a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how that contradiction between thy faith and thy practice, thy Religion and thy converſation is hid from thy eyes; It's a wonder, that thy ſins ſtare thee not in the face, when thou art in thy Chriſtian duties, like ſo many devils, asking you what you do there.

But every man changed from his former wicked wayes is not preſently a new Creature, though he be a new man. <hi>Ahab</hi> was a new man in his humiliations; he had new affections, new ſorrow, new humiliation, yet not a new Creature; This is diligently to be conſidered, that ſo men may ſee upon what grounds and motives they ſet upon a new courſe of life.

Golden times of peace and plenty made ruſty new Creatures, as I may ſo aliude; but times of perſecution took off all their ruſt, and made a luſtre upon them. This new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture therefore is unchangable in all changes, at leaſt for the main ſubſtance and root of grace; but there is many a man became new and wonderfully changed for a fit, for a pang; It's but a Land-flood not a Fountain, and ſo is quickly dryed up. The people of Iſrael in their afflictions were wonderfully changed, but their hearts were not ſtedfaſt within them; we have a notable inſtance in one particular, <hi>Jer.</hi> 34. 15, 16. where the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> warneth the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to let their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants go free at the time appointed by God, otherwiſe they ſhould not go free from judgements: Hereupon they entred into a Covenant, to proclaim liberty to their ſervants; but they did not hold long in this new change: Therfore mark that expreſſion, <hi>Ye were turned to day, and had done right; but ye turned again, and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted my name:</hi> See here how a people may be changed from evill to good, and then not long after change good unto evill again. Thus the Swine new waſhed is all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver new for a while, but ſhe returneth to her mire again: Thus <hi>Johns</hi> Hearers did rejoyce <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for an hour, for a ſeaſon; and afterwards they ſay, <hi>John</hi> had a Devill. Oh conſider then, whether thy becoming a new man, be not upon ſome fits for a little while, and then thou Apoſtatizeſt again: Thy inconſtancy is an argument of thy hypocriſie: Thou art but a blazing ſtar that may make a luſtre for a while, thou art not fixed in the Orb. Now with what earneſtneſſe ſhould this be preſſed upon you? How many men become new for a day, for a week, but then preſently return to their old luſts again? This argueth thy motion is not naturall, but violent, otherwiſe it would hold out.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>It may be defective in the motives of it; Thou art become a new Creature upon old grounds,</hi> for ſo it may fall out. Not love to Chriſt and ſpirituall conſiderations may ſet thee upon this change, but temporall fears, and love to outward mercies: When the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 16. would declare, <hi>That every man in Chriſt is a new Creature, and old things are paſſed away,</hi> he declareth this by inſtancing in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars; <hi>Henceforth know we no man after the fleſh,, no not Chriſt himſelf:</hi> A mighty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. The ſenſe is, That whereas once they delighted in, and had much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort by the bodily preſence of Chriſt; he was a great ſtay and comfort to them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:30767:156"/>
that they were exceedingly troubled to hear of his departure. Now (ſaith the Apoſtle) we look not after thoſe corporeal conſiderations, but know him after, a ſpiritual manner, we expect ſpiritual ſtrength, ſpiritual priviledges, and ſpiritual conſolations by him; ſo then if a new Creature, thy humiliations are after the Spirit, not after the Fleſh; all thy religious duties, thou knoweſt them not after the fleſh: But there are many men, though changed in their lives, yet it is after the fleſh only they are changed, becauſe Gods judgements were upon their eſtates, their bodies, and the outward man. The Prophet <hi>Hoſ. c.</hi> 7. doth excellently compare all the Jewes Prayers and Faſtings, becauſe for their wine and oyle onely, to howlings, that as bruit beaſts, when they are deprived of their food, and ready to be ſtarved, make an horrid howling, and yelling. No better did God eſteem of their humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and dejectons before him. Let not then any corrupt worm breed in thy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thou doſt newly ſet upon, for that may quickly devour all thy expected fruit.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>This new man may not be a new Creature, becauſe the change is wrought upon him by confuſed principles of the minde, and ſuddain affections and reſolutions, not by a diſtinct, clear, and well adviſed information of judgement.</hi> Thoſe hearers that recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Word with joy, found immediately a change upon them; but they held out for a ſeaſon only, becauſe it was not a deliberate work on them; Therefore our Saviour exhorts every one that would make a change of his life, and become his Diſciple, to ſit down firſt and conſider, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 28. whether he be able to make ſuch a building as that of grace is, or whether he can ſet out ſtrength enough againſt ſo many thouſand enemies that will be in the way. Obſerve it, he compares this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of Chriſtianity, and his diſcipleſhip to two great and chargeable things, which have exhauſted men of great Treaſures, building, and waging Warre; and therefore our Saviour turned back ſome that came to be Volunteers in his Service, informing them of the hardſhip that would accompany his wayes; ſo that there is no ſuch hopefull way of continuing in a good new change, as when this is wrought by a ſound illumination of the mind, and by ſtrong conviction of the judgement, through potent Arguments. And what can be thought the reaſon of ſo many Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates from the hopefull beginnings of grace, which ſeemed in many, but this onely, Their affections were wrought upon, they had great grief, great fear and terror upon their conſciences, but little or very weak workings upon their judgements? Therefore we Miniſters of God, think not this any ſuch great matter, to ſtir up in you, new grief, new ſorrow, new fears in you. Alas, this water will quickly be dryed up; but this is the great work, to convince your judgement with ſuch new light and reaſon out of Gods Word, and this will ſtick like an Arrow in thy heart: Thou wilt roar out and cry, Oh there are ſuch arguments from the Scripture, ſuch ſtrong reaſons from Gods Word for me to become a new man, that I am not able to gain-ſay them. Therefore this new creature is called Light in the Lord: fear all thoſe affections of grief, and ſorrow, and terror that are in thee, being but affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and not the fruit of an inlightned judgment, will quickly vaniſh away: And as rotten fruit falls to the ground before it is ripe, ſo will all theſe affections decay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they come to any maturity, that flow not from a ſanctified underſtanding. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines ſay, God beginneth orderly, he firſt worketh in the underſtanding, and by that moveth and exciteth the affections; but the divell he firſt moveth the affections, and by them he perverteth and corrupteth the underſtanding. Thus he propounded to <hi>Eve</hi> what was good to the eye, and pleaſant to the taſte, thereby to enſnare the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and by that means blinded her judgement. Therefore the Apoſtle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>Timothy, to reprove with all Doctrine, 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 2. To make men afraid and tremble about ſin, when by good and ſound Doctrine they are not informed of the foulneſſe and guilt of it will never hold.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>This new man comes ſhort it may be of a new Creature, becauſe the work of grace is not deep enough.</hi> He is an outward new creature, but not an inward new creature. That fooliſh builder our Saviour ſpeaketh of, who loſt all his pains and coſt, miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in this, becauſe he did not dig deep enough: Thy heart is throughly wounded
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:30767:157"/>
for ſin, and ſlightly cured again: It hath not been a deep wound, or a ſure cure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: ſo then as Planters of trees are careful about the root and builders wary about the foundation; ſo when thou beginneſt to ſet upon a new courſe of life, remember that thou goe low enough into thy ſoul, that it may take root downward as well as fruit upward. The heart is full of hardneſſe and ſtonineſſe, and ſo thou canſt not get into the bottome of it preſently; the love of God, the fear of God rooted in the heart would make thee hold out a new man alwayes.</p>
                  <p>I might now ſpeak of other Counterfeits of this new Creature, <hi>As a man affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting new and ſtrange opinions, he is very prone to judge the better of himſelf becauſe of</hi>

                     <hi>this;</hi> ſo a man undertaking ſome new and ſtrict way different from the Word of God, as the way of Phariſaiſm: but I have handled theſe already, when I ſpake of falſe Signs. I ſhall therefore conclude this Text and Subject with the ſuggeſtion of ſome helps and remedies to become new Creatures; for I doubt not but that many of you, at leaſt in ſome ſad thoughts or other, have reſolutions to become new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The conſcience ſurely is not ſo ſtupified, but it many times tells thee, O this old life thou liveſt muſt be altered, it's time to turn over a new leaf, to learn a new leſſon; God forbid I ſhould dye with theſe ſins upon me! How many times doſt thou reſolve and purpoſe, I will never be prophane more, My life ſhall be new, I will ſet upon a new courſe in my family; but theſe buds are quickly ſnipt off by ſome cold froſt or other. What directions then may be given to keep this purpoſe in our hearts, and to put theſe reſolutions into practice? for we reſolve, and reſolve to be new, but we live and dye in old wayes. To help us herein, take theſe directions following.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Let thy reſolutions come from ſolid reaſons, not ſuddain affections.</hi> This I <note place="margin">1.</note> hinted before; What purpoſe is taken up by ſtrong demonſtrations from Scripture, they will hold alwayes the ſame, becauſe the Scripture is the ſame. The Scripture doth repreſent ſinne in a terrible aggravation as well one day as another; that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth the goodneſſe of God in the ſame attractive manner as well one week as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: whereas meer ſuddain affections they ebbe and flow. If therefore thy reſolutions doe not hold as firmly againſt ſinne in time of health as well as ſickneſs, if they be not as cordiall in thy life time as at the time of death, quicken thy ſelf up with Scripture-arguments, and ſay, The Word of God ſaith the ſame things ſtill, and why ſhould not my heart be the ſame ſtill?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Let thy reſolutions to become a new man, be made not in thy own ſtrength, but in the ſtrength of Chriſt:</hi> Thou doſt reſolve in thy own power to caſt out the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vills <note place="margin">2.</note> that poſſeſſe thee, thou purpoſeſt in thy own ſtrength to deſtroy theſe <hi>Goliahs.</hi> But ſaith <hi>Paul, I can do all things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me, Phil.</hi> 4. 13. And ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Without me ye can doe nothing, John</hi> 15. He doth not ſay, No great thing, but nothing; and he doth not ſay, Ye cannot perfect, or conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate any thing without me, but ye can doe nothing without me, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> well conſidereth the Text; and then it's <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, without me, or ſeparated from me; As the Branch cut from the Vine cannot bear any fruit: Now the more ſenſible and apprehenſive thou art of thy own infirmities, and impotency, the more ready Chriſt is to help: ſay, O Lord, though this be too great a work for me, I cannot throw theſe mountains into the Sea, yet it is not too great for thee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Let theſe reſolutions be accompanied with earneſt and fervent prayers to God.</hi> Thou purpoſeſt and reſolveſt, but where are thy lively and powerfull ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <note place="margin">3.</note> unto God? There is no ſuch Engine to batter down all the ſtrong holds of ſinne, as prayer; ſee our Saviours incouragement herein, <hi>Ask and ye ſhall receive, knock and it ſhall be opened,</hi> Mat. 7. 7. Prayer is the key of Heaven, as the Ancients called it; thy reſolutions therefore and deſires are like thoſe of the ſluggard, who deſireth, and deſireth, but putteth not his hands to work, and ſo his deſires are ſaid to kill him; Thus thou reſolveſt, and reſolveſt, but doſt not ſet home, or back theſe reſolutions by earneſt and ſtrong prayers; therefore thy reſolutions deſtroy thee: A man ſtrong in reſolutions, and weak in ſupplications will preſently be foyled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:30767:157"/>
every temptation, you muſt not therefore onely reſolve, but you muſt watch, pray, and even yet thy reſolutions take no place, extraordinarily faſt, and ſeek to God; for ſinnes that have been long upon thee, are like thoſe divels which poſſeſſed a man from his youth, and ſuch could not be caſt out, but by prayer and faſting.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>If thou wouldſt turn theſe godly reſolutions into godly actions, ſeparate</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>thy ſelf immediately from all temptations and occaſions to ſinne,</hi> from all evill compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, who are apt to hinder thee in ſuch good purpoſes; for it's vain thing to think thy ſelf ſtrong enough to abſtain from a ſin, when thou canſt not withdraw from the occaſion of it. The Jewes that were to abſtain from leaven in the dayes of the Paſſover, that they might be ſure not to eate it, would not ſo much as have it in their houſes: yea, ſo ſuperſtitious were they, that they would not ſo much as mention the word <hi>Lechem,</hi> Bread, leſt leaven ſhould come into a mans minde. The <hi>Nazarite</hi> that was not to drink wine, would neither eat Grapes. Therefore bid farewell to all thy old companions, all thy old temptations, and ſay as that new Creature once did, who formerly living in Fornications and the Whore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſolicite him as ſhe uſed to doe, he cryed out, <hi>Ego non ſum ego,</hi> I am not I: I am another man than I was.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Purſue thy reſolutions into actions,</hi> becauſe of thy mortality and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty <note place="margin">5.</note> of life. <hi>To day if you will hear, harden not your hearts;</hi> Now therefore, or it may be never: Do not as ſome Heathens, which Offer their Bee-wax unto their Gods, and keep the Honey to themſelves. Doe not thou reſerve thy old decrepit age for this new Creature, and ſpend the prime and flower of thy time in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of ſin: <hi>Poſt Geneſin ſequitur Exodus,</hi> as ſoon as we have a beginning we are making to an end; Why then art thou ſtill reſolving, and reſolving, when thou haſt no ſecurity for thy life? This night, this day, thy ſoul ſhall be taken away from thee. Oh thou mortall man, and lump of clay, thou that art but ſo much duſt before the wind, how dareſt thou put off becoming a new man?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> Of exhortation, <hi>Let not this Subject be preached in vain unto you.</hi> The ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> and excellency of it, might be our conſtant Theme: we might ſit down as ſoon as ever we have read the Text, and ſay, This is the ſumme of all. Doe not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive your ſelves; as if thy old wayes thou haſt lived in will leade thee to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. If theſe were our inventions, if they were our words and perſwaſions one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you might eaſily reject them, but being the aſſertions and plain commands of the Word, how can you but hear and tremble! and above all motives let this prevail, <hi>viz.</hi> The wonderfull comfort, joy and peace of conſcience you will have in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That I am not as I have been; ſuch and ſuch ſins have been committed: but oh (bleſſed be God) I have forſaken them: you would not be what you were once for all <hi>Solomons</hi> wealth. Alas! What torments and helliſh pangs did you, while old ſervants to ſin, feel? What gripes and ſtings, that thou livedſt ſo, and waſt not changed into a new man!</p>

To underſtand the Text, we muſt take notice of the coherence, as the very firſt word <hi>For,</hi> dothadvertiſe us. In the begining of this chapter the Apoſtle after a moſt divine and admirable manner, deſcribeth the whole nature of our juſtification, regeneration, and ſalvation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. From the Efficient cauſe, <hi>God rich in mercy;</hi> with the impulſive cauſe, <hi>For his great love wherewith he loved us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. From the Meritorious, or as the Logicians call it, the <hi>Procatarcticall</hi> cauſe, <hi>moving God from without, through Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. From the Final cauſe, <hi>To ſhew forth the exceeding riches of his Glory.</hi> From this deſcription ſo magnificent and full of ſpiritual glory, ariſeth verſe 8. a ſure and ſolid propoſition, <hi>By grace ye are ſaved:</hi> From the firſt to the laſt, <hi>all is of Grace:</hi> And grace that is without us, <hi>viz.</hi> The good love of God, not any dwelling in us. We are ſaved: Salvation is here either put for juſtification, becauſe by that we are intituled to heaven, or elſe we are ſaid to be already ſaved, becauſe we have the ſeal and pledge of it here; and it is begun in us, and alſo we have a ſure right to it:
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:30767:159"/>
and <hi>qui jus habet ad rem, rem ipſam videtur habere:</hi> ſome underſtand ſalvation, as much as a purgation, or deliverance from ſin; for as ſin is called death, ſo free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome from it, may be called life and ſalvation: it comes all to one. In the next place we have the inſtrumental cauſe of our ſalvation, and that is Faith: And leſt we ſhould be thought to have this faith of our ſelves, as if God indeed gave his mercy &amp; grace to thoſe that believe, but we did believe by our own power; God giveth the Oyl, and we bring the veſſel to receive it, he preſently addeth, <hi>and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God:</hi> And as if the ſpirit of God would herein expreſly provide againſt all thoſe ſubtile opinions that craftily undermine Grace, he further addeth by way of oppoſition, <hi>Not of works,</hi> giving alſo a reaſon of the whole, <hi>leſt any man ſhould</hi> boaſt: Whereupon my Text is brought in as a reaſon to prove all is of Grace, <hi>For we are his workmanſhip.</hi> The ſtrength of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lyeth upon that rule in Logick, <hi>Nothing can be a cauſe and effect too, in the ſame conſideration.</hi> But our works and holineſs, they are the effects of his grace: <hi>We are his workmanſhip,</hi> therefore they cannot be a cauſe; and yet leſt by magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Grace, and ſetting up of faith, excluding all that we do, he might ſeem to juſtle out good works, and an holy life, he ſaith, <hi>We are created in Chriſt to doe them,</hi> onely they are effects flowing from grace, not cauſes producing grace.

It is to have the Fountain, the ſumm, the Treaſurie of all good: It is the Divines rule, That we muſt not go to an abſolute God, but relative one, conſidered in the relation of a gracious Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venent: For hereby God hath bound himſelf; and though we cannot plead our worth, yet we may his fidelity and truth: Though we cannot urge our works, yet we may his words: So that if we look into the Original of this workmanſhip, we ſhall finde it to be the onely Grace of God: Gods word is gone out of his mouth; and ſo being once paſſed under this rod, as the Scripture expreſſeth it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. 37. we may boldly urge at the throne of Grace, <hi>Oh Lord, it was once free to thee whether thou wouldſt own us or no, do good to us or not, but ſince thou haſt entered into promiſe with us, thou canſt not deny thy ſelf.</hi> So that to be Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, Gods people, is to be had as it were into the mount of Transfigurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and God ſhews thee all the glory of heaven, and ſaith, <hi>All this will I give thee.</hi>

And herein that holds true which was told you not long ſince, That it coſts Chriſt more to make us his people, then to create the world; for there it was but his word, ſaying, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light:</hi> But here it is his death and ſufferings, to redeem us from our former evil waies. This ſhould make us even ſtartle, and be aſtoniſhed at the noiſome, and foul guilt of ſin, which plungeth us into an irrecoverable loſſe, unleſſe by Chriſts blood we are ſet at liberty: Every ſin is the price of Chriſts blood. Now herein people do much deceive themſelves; they look for ſalvation by Chriſts blood, but not for a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from the power of ſin, whereas the blood of Chriſt doth not onely cleanſe away guilt, but it alſo makes white and fruitfull to every good word and work.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Which is moſt proper to this Text, we are his people and workmanſhip by a gracious renovasion, and making all things new in us.</hi> God once made us after <note place="margin">IV.

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That it is a wofull thing to be the workmanſhip of God by Naturall creation, and not his workmanſhip by gracious Renovation.</hi> It had been better for thee never to have been born, never to have been Gods creature in the firſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, if thou art not his creature in the ſecond making. Thus our Saviour ſaid of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, It had been better for him he had never been born,</hi> Mark 14. 21. Some Scholaſtical
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:30767:160"/>
heads have thought the very natural being of a man, to be ſo great a good, as that in reaſon a man would chuſe rather to be damned, then not to be at all: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they expound that ſpeech of our Saviours concerning <hi>Judas,</hi> to be true only in regard of the ſenſitive part of a man, but not his rational. But this cannot hold: for</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Damnation is the inflicting of an infinite evill upon a man, ſo far as he is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of it, and the depriving him of an infinite good.</hi> Now to be, or to have a <note place="margin">I. Why it were better never to be, then not to be new made.</note> life, is but finite, limited good: If therefore thou art not Gods gracious work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, it had been better if thou hadſt been a Toad, a Serpent, yea, nothing at all, then to be a man: And if men in the extremity of their bodily paio, have curled the day that ever they were born, as we read <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> though it was their great ſinful impatience to do ſo: How much rather muſt they cry out ſo in hell, where there is not one drop of hony in all the gall they have? Not the leaſt drop of water can be had to cool ſo much as the top of their tongue. Why then do not your ears tingle while they hear this? Art thou not a New Creature? Hath not God made thee all over anew? Oh miſerable man! Alas that ever thou wert born! How often wilt thou wiſh in the horror of thy conſcience, thou hadſt never been a man? Why doſt thou rejoyce in thy wealth, in thy greatneſs, in thy comforts, and haſt no true godlineſs to rejoyce in? If thou hadſt all <hi>Solomons</hi> wealth, and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſalems</hi> daies to enjoy it, yet if not Gods workmanſhip, wo be thee that ever thou wert born!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Thou hadſt better never have been Gods natural creature, if not this gracious creature; becauſe this natural life is fraughted with many miſeries and troubles, ſo</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">II.</note> 
                     <hi>that the grief is more then the joy: now to be miſerable here, and miſerable for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hereafter, is miſery in its height. Man that is born of a woman is of few daies, and full of trouble,</hi> Job 14. 1. But man that is born of God, is incorruptible, and everlaſting, and full of peace and joy in the holy Ghoſt. Alas, all thy comforts in this life, which are but few, they hang but upon a thred of thy uncertain life: ſo that as the heathen ſaid, when one was commending the riches, and wealth of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, <hi>Non amo faelicitatem è funibus pendentem,</hi> I do not love that wealth which hangs upon ropes, if they break the ſhip miſcarrieth. We may ſay of all comforts: We love not that profit, that pleaſure which hangs upon thred: Why then doſt thou not betake thy ſelf to ſome ſolitary &amp; ſerious contemplation? ſaying, What is my life worth? wherein am I more happy then beaſts? then that Toad that creeps there, if I be not made a new Creature?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Therefore better never be born, then not be this workmanſhip of God, becauſe hereby a man is fruſtrated of his end, and that true happineſs which ought to be the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">III.</note> 
                     <hi>ſtudy and endeavours of all.</hi> Man as he was created with more remarkable excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency then other Creatures, therefore you have the Scripture bringing in God, as it were, conſulting with others, <hi>Let us make man after our own image;</hi> ſo was be ordained to a more ſublime and glorious end, which was to enjoy God, and hate eternal communion with him; and the means to partake of this beatitude, was the image of God, a pure and holy nature. Now when we loſt, or fell from this means and help, we alſo Apoſtatized from that glorious end: And by this means in ſtead of everlaſting happineſs, meet with everlaſting horror and damnation: So that if the bleſſedneſs of every thing lye in its proper and ſutable operations after the moſt perfect manner, to its proper end, then are we become moſt miſerable, who are turned both out of the way to, and end of all happineſs. Oh that men ſhould not more conſider the end why they are made, the end why God gives them to live and move and have a being, is it to eat and drink and ſatisfie thy llſts, and at laſt go down into hell in a moment? Oh be not as bruit beaſts, that periſh without underſtanding.</p>
                  <p>In the third place obſerve this, <hi>That as here in the Text we are called in the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>general Gods workmanſhip, ſo in other places we have the particular kinde of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip expreſſed;</hi> For Gods word doth uſe ſeveral ſimilitudes to expreſſe our rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:30767:160"/>
to God, that ſo what one is not emphatical to declare, the other may do it. Thus we have handled the relation of Sons, which is more then his workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; for an houſe is the Artificers workmanſhip, but it is not his Childe, and therefore he hath not ſuch endeared affections to it. In other places they are called, <hi>The wife of Chriſt,</hi> to ſhew their intimate conjunction, <hi>That they are bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh;</hi> but in other places the Workmanſhip of God, under the inſtance of an houſe. As a man dwels in his houſe, ſo God doth not only make us his people, but he dwels in us afterwards: Now how rich and glorious muſt that ſoul be, who hath Chriſt lodging and reſting in it? He that ſits in his Glory at the right hand of God, doth alſo abide and dwell in thy heart. In other places, this workmanſhip is not only called an Houſe, but a Temple, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. and that denoteth more then an Houſe, <hi>viz.</hi> a peculiar deſtination and conſecration of it to God. Thus every godly man converted is made a Temple of the holy Ghoſt. Its peculiarly dedicated to God; ſo that luſts and Satan have nothing to do there. Thus you ſee what kind of Workmanſhip we are, Gods Houſe, Gods Temple. Oh the marvellous dignity and purity that ought to be in every New Creature! How comes Owls and Satyrs, luſts of darkneſſe to be in the Temple of the Lord! ſometimes we are his Workmanſhip of a Vine-yard, or a pleaſant Garden, as the book of <hi>Canticles</hi> ſignifieth, planted as <hi>Eden</hi> was by God himſelf? Now how come briars and brambles up in Gods Garden? So that the conſideration of our being Gods Workmanſhip ſhould make us take heed there be nothing of ſins, or the Devils workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in us.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth place conſider, <hi>Wherein Gods Workmanſhip as we are New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. Wherein Gods workmanſhip as we are New Creatures ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth that as we are crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</note> 
                     <hi>ſurpaſſeth that as we are creatures;</hi> And herein we muſt remove one falſe difference that is aſſigned in Popery, which is this, <hi>God indeed</hi> (ſay they) <hi>made us without our ſelves, there was not our Will or Conſent required to it; but he doth not new make us, or cauſe us to be New Creatures without our Will;</hi> and they bring that old ſaying of <hi>Auguſtines, Qui fecit te ſine te, non juſtificabit te ſine te.</hi> He that made thee without thy own power, he will not alſo convert thee without thy own power. But the Scripture makes us wholly paſſive in that firſt work of grace. Although it be alſo true, That in being made New Creatures, we are not without underſtanding and a will at that time, but there is no natural imbred power in us to turn our ſelves unto God, as the very phraſe Workmanſhip and Created do import; and truly this is the end of the Apoſtle in this part of the Chapter, to exclude every work of ours; for if it be never ſo little, we may boaſt at leaſt ſo farre, but there is a vaſt difference in the original and cauſe of the one and the other.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>God made the world, and with other creatures, man as the epitome of all,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">I.</note> 
                     <hi>out of his general love and goodneſſe.</hi> He did not create from natural neceſſity, as Bees make their Hives and Honey, or as the Sunne communicateth his light, but voluntarily and out of his meer love, <hi>Ex indulgentiâ,</hi> not <hi>indigentiâ.</hi> Bernard. So that it was Gods goodneſſe to thee to make thee a man, and not a toad, or a ſerpent: <hi>But the original of making us New Creatures is a ſpecial and more peculiar love.</hi> As <hi>Jacob</hi> loved <hi>Joſeph</hi> with a ſpecial love, and as a ſign thereof, gave him a party-coloured Coat: So God with a ſpecial favour is carried out to ſuch whom he converts, and beſtoweth on them the choice Ornaments of Grace. Hence it's never called Gods Grace, that he made the world; we doe not attribute it to Gods Grace properly that we live and have a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but to his Love and Goodneſſe. But the Scripture doth peculiarly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate it to the Grace of God, that he elects us, juſtifieth, ſanctifieth and glorifieth us.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond Difference is, <hi>In regard of the acts and works of God in his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">II.</note> 
                     <hi>and diſpenſation towards them;</hi> For God dealeth with man as a Creature
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:30767:161"/>
in the way of a general Providence, and ſo man as a Creature meerly is looked unto, as the Beaſts of the field, and the Fowls of the air, only in a more noble Degree, becauſe he is a more noble Creature: but now Gods dealing to his New Creatures, is in a way of Predeſtination, and a Covenant of Grace; ſo that even the very outward Mercies that the New Creature hath, come from a ſweeter and more comfortable ſpring, then they doe to a meer man; for thy very Food, Health, Raiment, and all thy daily outward Mercies, they are the fruit of Election, not of general Providence, and ſo they come from the ſame Love, which predeſtinated thee to glory, and doth juſtifie thy perſon: Oh what a raviſhing conſideration is this to every New Creature! How may he triumph with <hi>Paul, Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect?</hi> That which is but Providence to others is Predeſtination to thee.</p>
                  <p>A third Difference is, <hi>In regard of the Comforts, and ſupports God gives to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">III.</note> 
                     <hi>the New Creature, above thoſe to the Old Creature.</hi> God giveth to man as a man, many outward humane Comforts, otherwiſe even to live would be an Hell; Inſomuch that all life is for ſome Delight and Comfort. Thus God hath put into all mens hearts ſome Delight and Comfort, as a Cordiall againſt thoſe many miſeries they are to grapple with in this world. Hence ſome men take Comfort in one thing, ſome in another, according to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral inclinations; and when theſe humane Comforts are taken away, then their hearts break, and they have no more content in their lives. Thus God hath alſo provided admirable and wonderful Comforts and Supports for this New Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>They rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> and that in the midſt of all outward miſeries, when all humane Comforts fail, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 1. This is like ſome Herb that will be green and freſh in the midſt of Winter, when all other are dead or withered: Oh then the folly of thoſe who cannot part with their pleaſures of ſinne, they think they ſhall part with all their joy then, and never have a comfortable day more. Alas, thou never haſt true ſolid joy, till thou leave thoſe ſinful pleaſures, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> had not Manna, till the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Garlick was gone. Other differences might be mentioned, but becauſe this is a fruitful point in the uſe of it, I come to the practical improvement of it.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, Are thoſe who are converted Gods Workmanſhip, the choice and excellent worke of his hands? then let us <hi>Examine our ſelves, whoſe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> 
                     <hi>workes are thoſe we do?</hi> Are thy Lies, thy Oathes, thy Luſts Gods Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip? Are theſe the good workes God hath ordained thee to walk in? Oh, if thou pretendeſt to be Gods Workmanſhip, why are there ſo many works of Sinne and Satan in thy life? It is ſtrange that men doe not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with their owne hearts, and conſider their lives no more. Where is their Faith? And why is their Conſcience ſo aſleep? for doe they not eaſily ſee themſelves the Devils Workmanſhip, and are they not of him as their father? Oh do not think that any greatneſſe or ſtoutneſſe of ſtomack will bear thee out againſt God! When God at the day of Judgment ſhall ſummon thee to his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, and ask, Whoſe workmanſhip art thou? Whoſe works haſt thou done? Wilt thou not be preſently confounded before God and the whole world, not knowing what to ſay or do?</p>
                  <p>Are the people of God his workmanſhip? then here is ground for many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable conſiderations. As <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Thou groaneſt under the defect of grace, thou mourneſt for thy imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Faith, imperfect Love, imperfect heavenly-mindedneſſe. Oh conſider <note place="margin">1.</note> thou art Gods Workmanſhip, and he will make all perfect at laſt, never fear that ſinne, Satan or the world can deſtroy the work of God; Chriſt came to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the works of the fleſh, and the Devil; The Devil cannot deſtroy the works of Chriſt, Chriſt did caſt out Devils from men, but the Devils cannot caſt Chriſt out of the heart. Oh then be not caſt down and inordinately dejected
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:30767:161"/>
with thy rude, confuſed and diſorderly heart, for God will at laſt put all into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent order. Never think that God is like that fooliſh Builder, who began to build, and could not make an end; No, God will make every grace in thee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ere he hath done with thee.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Its ground of great Comfort in all thy ſad temptations and miſeries, <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> whatſoever thy burden be. Thou art Gods Workmanſhip, and ſo he cannot but pity thee. The Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. ſpeaks of us as Creatures. He knoweth what we are made of, he conſiders that we are not as braſſe or iron, but brittle clay, and <hi>he heareth the young Ravens when they cry to him;</hi> Now if God ſhew ſuch pity to all things, becauſe his natural Creatures; what compaſſion will he ſhew to his gracious Creatures? Oh therefore pray fervently unto God, Lord, are we not thy Workmanſhip? Thou that heareſt the cry of Ravens, wilt thou not hear the cry and groans made by thy holy Spirit in us? Even the Sea-monſters draw out their breſts to their young ones, and Lord, wilt not thou behold us thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and relieve us in our wants? Many other comfortable Meditations might be ſucked out of this Point, ſweeter then the honey or the honey-comb.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Uſe of Inſtruction, to ſuch who are the Workmanſhip of God, Oh do <note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> nothing to blurre and ſoil this curious work of God in thee. If God hath made thee excellent and holy, wilt thou with theſe new cloathes upon thee go and roll in the dirt, when ſin or the world tempts thee? Remember that thou art Gods Workmanſhip, Shall the Heavens become like a noiſome dunghill? Shall the works of fleſh and Satan be found in the Workmanſhip of God? You that are New Creatures, as you have exceeding great Priviledges, ſo alſo great Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to holineſſe; that wickedneſſe and ungodlineſſe is not to be found in you, which is ſeen in the world.</p>

                  <p>My buſineſſe at this time will be to deſcribe the manner of this workmanſhip, <hi>Created;</hi> And here I ſhall not touch upon what hath already been obſerved about this action, but conſider it in another diſtinct notion, which is this;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As God at the Creation made the earth which was without form and void, and ſo
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:30767:162"/>
wholly indiſpoſed, to bring forth fruit, by that word of command and bleſſing upon it, when he ſaid, Let the earth bring forth graſſe and fruit. Even thus of diſorderly, wicked and moſt indispoſed men to any godly actions, he doth by his grace make us prepared and fitted to every good work.</hi> Now that it might wholly appear to be of Gods bleſſing and power meerly, that the earth did bring forth fruit and graſſe, obſerve Gods Providence herein; For he gives this command to the earth, before he had made a Sun, and before there was any rain, ſo that all muſt acknowledge this fruitfull and germinative power in the earth to be meerly of God. There was no more at firſt in the earth to bear fruit, than in any ſtones or dry wood. Even ſuch an admirable work of God is this ſpirituall change which he makes upon men. For thoſe who formerly were enemies, and adverſaries unto all godlineſſe, they become lovers and delighters in it. Oh how neceſſary and comfortable is it to preach of this mighty work of God? for hereby we hope, that God may create ſome ſuch auditors, and make to himſelf a holy and godly people out of thoſe who before were prophane and ungodly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Such is the great and mighty work of God, that he makes thoſe, who where altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obſerv.</hi> That God in this worke makes thoſe that are unfit and averſe to holineſs, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it.</note> 
                     <hi>unfit and averſe from what is godly and holy, to imbrace and delight in it. Thus God is ſaid to be able to raiſe up Children to Abraham out of ſtones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every time thou ſeeſt an ignorant prophane man made a believer and holy, then is a very ſtone made <hi>Abrahams</hi> childe; every time you behold a wicked and wretched ſinner, praying, humbling himſelfe, and reforming his life, you may then wonder and ſay; Behold how God makes Grapes to grow of Thorns, and Figs on Thiſtles; when God makes <hi>Matthew</hi> a Publican to leave his gainfull ſinnes, and to follow him; when he cauſeth <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> to bewaile and forſake her former luſts, God doth as he did at firſt Creation, out of a confuſed and unformed heap, make a glorious world. Therefore the Apoſtle uſeth that expreſſion, God who worketh light out of darkneſſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 6. implying that God did not once only at the Creation, work light of darkneſſe, but ſtill he doth it daily. Even as often as he makes the Word of God to enter into mens hearts. So that we may ſay even of the worſt and prophaneſt of people, as the Prophet did to God, when God asked him, <hi>Can theſe dry bones live?</hi> Ezek. 37. 3. So, Can ſuch a people, ſo ſtupid, ſo careleſſe, ſo rebellious, be prepared to every good work? O Lord thou knoweſt! that is, O Lord, its in thy power, thou canſt do whatſoever thou pleaſeſt! A Camel with his big bunch on his back hath no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſition or fitneſſe to enter a needles eye, yet God can make it do ſo. Though we deny there is any tranſubſtantiation, God cannot (and <hi>Potentiſſimè non poteſt)</hi> or rather one ſubſtance cannot be changed into another, and they retain their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per dimenſions and qualities; Yet in every converſion of a ſinner, there is a ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tranſmutation in reſpect of the qualities thereof, darkneſſe is made light, gall is made honey. This glorious conqueſt over mens hearts is propheſied of as the great glory of Chriſts Kingdom, <hi>Iſa. 11. 6. The Wolf and the Lamb ſhall lie down toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> &amp;c. That curſed enmity ſhall be removed, when God ſhall take away the poiſonous nature of evil men. Thus <hi>Iſai. 29. 18. The deaf ſhall hear, and the blinds ſhall ſee,</hi> and <hi>verſ. 24. They that erred in spirit and murmured ſhall learn Doctrine,</hi> who more unlikely to hear then refractory and rebellious men? yet theſe ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.</p>
                  <p>To explain this Doctrine, let us view the truth of it in particulars. As <note place="margin">The Point ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in theſe particulars. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>God in this spiritual change makes a people unfit, unpoliſhed, and every wayes indispoſed, ſutable, and enclining to what is holy.</hi> Every man naturally lies like a rude ſtone in the quarry, it muſt be poliſhed and come under much ſawing and cutting ere it can be put into the building. Hence an upright heart ſometimes is called by a word that ſignifieth a <hi>poliſhed heart,</hi> the roughneſſe and ruggedneſſe of it is taken away. Thus the work of renovation is expreſſed by taking away an heart of ſtone, and giving an heart of fleſh. Take a ſtone and you can make no impreſſion upon it, whereas fleſh is pliable and tender. Now this ruggedneſſe
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:30767:162"/>
and unpreparedneſſe of people to become godly, how univerſal is it? Though many <hi>John Baptists,</hi> are <hi>A voice crying, Prepare a way for the Lord,</hi> yet the <hi>Mountains are not made low, or the valleys exalted to make an even and plain way,</hi> till God prepare all. That <hi>Orphaeus</hi> ſo much celebrated by the Heathens for his muſical Harp, thereby taming the wilde and ſavage Creatures, as alſo making Trees and Buſhes to runne after him as raviſhed with his Muſick, is nothing but a wiſe Magiſtrate, by wholſome and good Laws making a barbarous people, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and righteous. But how much rather may the Word of God be called that Harp which changeth Beaſts into Angels, and makes rude and ſottiſh people holy? And certainly all people generally are ſuch a barren wilderneſſe, that if we do look to mans power meerly, we ſhould deſpair of ever ſeeing them made pleaſant Gardens. And as all new Plantations finding a people uncivilized, and the ground unhusbanded, need a world of pains and diligence to bring them into good order; ſo the ſeveral Diſpenſations of Gods Word, in divers places, which are like ſpiritual Plantations, need much labour, preaching, inſtruction and exhortations, ere they are fitted for heavenly operations. Let us therefore make you look up unto Heaven, imploring that omnipotent power of God; Oh ſay, Lord, bid theſe dry bones live! Theſe crooked Trees to become ſtraight: ſay, Lord, I have no fitneſſe in me to pray, to hear, to do what is godly: O do thou prepare and ſit the heart!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Of a people wholly impotent and unable, God in this ſpiritual Renovatior, he makes able and ſtrong in ſome meaſure to do things pleaſing to him.</hi> That womb of <note place="margin">2.</note> the ſoul which was ſo barren that no humane power could open it, God makes fruitful. Our impotency is ſuppoſed in that we are dead in ſinne, and not <hi>able of our ſelves to think one good thought;</hi> What can be leſſe then this, we are not able of our ſelves to entertain the leaſt good thought how we may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, how we may leave and forſake our ſins. Neither doth this diſcovery of our impotency excuſe us, and make us the leſſe ſinful, or to be the leſſe pitied; for it with us, as with a man, who had a great ſtock given him, and he hath prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally ſpent all. This voluntary inability of his doth not excuſe him from paying his debts, but makes him more faulty, who might have done well and would not. Thus God gave us a rich and plentiful portion, and we quickly ſpent all; and now the Law of God cals upon us for good actions, as ſo many debts we owe, and we are not able to diſcharge any. But when this renewing grace of God is vouchſafed to us, then the <hi>lame can walk, the blinde can ſee, the dead Lazarus can come out of the grave, and have the grave cloaths untied,</hi> in which he was bound; So that we Miniſters in preaching, and you people in hearing are to call upon God fervently and earneſtly, that he would take away all our ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and inſufficiency. Oh pray that he would give thee good thoughts, good affections, and ſo good operations! ſay, Oh that God who made ſo many <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Corinthians, Epheſians,</hi> of weeds to become flowers, that he would vouchſafe the like gracious power to us! ſay, Oh Lord, thy arm is not ſhorten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, our hearts are no more too ſtrong for thee, then theirs were.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>In this ſpiritual change, God of a froward, contrary and irreconcilable</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>people, makes a loving and willing people to what is good.</hi> Take all men till faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by grace, they are enemies to God and godlineſſe. The wiſdome of the fleſh is not ſubject to God, neither can it be. As the Wolf cannot love the Lamb, nor the Hawk the Dove; ſo neither can wicked men love thoſe things that are holy. What a wofull experience have all the wicked men in the world in their ſeveral ages, given of their curſed venom, and cankered malice againſt godlineſſe, in all the oppoſitions they have raiſed againſt the faithful Meſſengers of God, reproving them for ſinne, and informing them of duty! Oh but when God makes theſe waters to go back, when he toucheth theſe mountains and they melt like wax, then what imbracing and loving is there of that which once
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:30767:163"/>
they could not endure. Thus <hi>Pſal. 110. Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power;</hi> Oh then that we could ſee God making ſuch a wonderful change up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. The time hath been, thou waſt an enemy to all godly waies, a profeſſed oppoſer and ſcorner of them. No Toad ſo odious in thy eyes as one who lived ſtrictly and laboured to fear God in all his waies; but now God hath made ſuch a change that they are only thy delight upon the earth. Thy righteous ſoul is now like <hi>Lots,</hi> grieved and tormented to ſee and hear the evil doings of wicked men: if thus, thou art then one created to good works.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Where this powerfull Renovation is, There God of a people that were</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>weary of his ſervice, and repining at it, as a burden, do now delight and rejoyce in it, as the greateſt happineſſe they are capable of.</hi> Thus <hi>Iſa. 4. The Nations ſhall flow to the mountains of the Lord.</hi> Though it be againſt their nature and cuſtome, and former advantages of profit and pleaſure, yet they overcome all theſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, and account nothing ſo dear, as the opportunities of enjoying God in his Ordinances. See in what an heavenly manner <hi>Davids</hi> affections are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, who could <hi>live alwayes in the Courts of the Lords houſe,</hi> and envied the very Sparrows that came ſo near the Altar. And certainly if the carnal and worldly heart can rejoice ſo much in thoſe advantages, where their luſts are ſatisfied, how much rather muſt a ſpiritual heart in the midſt of all theſe ſpiritual applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe ſpiritual good things are unmixed, and have no gall in them at all, as the good things of the world have?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Of a people inconſtant and unſetled in the wayes of God, by this new change</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>he makes fixed and rooted upon a ſure Rock.</hi> Obſerve the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they often cried unto the Lord in their extremities, but their hearts were not ſtedfaſt within them, and ſo they quickly revolted again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. 31. But the people of God are ſaid to be like Mount <hi>Sion, that cannot be removed,</hi> Pſal. 133. 3. <hi>The gates of hell cannot prevail againſt them.</hi> They are an houſe built upon a <hi>Rock,</hi> and ſo when the winds and tempeſts ariſe, <hi>they ſtand faſt.</hi> As God is a God that changeth not, ſo they are holy, believing, and change not. <hi>Iſraels righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is like a morning Dew,</hi> Hoſ. 13. 2. it quickly drieth up, the Dew fals as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> obſerveth, when the Mornings are neither too hot or cold; Thus an heart that is lukewarm, and hath no real, inward efficacy of grace, ſets upon Duties, but when the Sunne ariſeth and ſcorcheth, preſently the graſſe withereth. Oh its a great Argument of this New Creation, to be ſtedfaſt and immovable in the work of the Lord. Not to change with the times and ſeaſons; To be one while for the truths and waies of God, and another while to be againſt them. Thoſe things that are from a principle of nature are conſtant, and alwaies alike, but thoſe things which come about by accident, and as it happens; they are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and incertain. See then thou art, as it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>The ſame Yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and to day, and for ever.</hi> As great ſtorms and tempeſts diſcover what root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tree hath, ſo variety of conditions doth manifeſt what mettall we are made of. As therefore <hi>David</hi> praied, That God would alwaies keep up that willingneſſe in the mens hearts, who then offered to God; ſo doe thou deſire that God alwaies would keep thy ſoul in that tenderneſſe, love and ſtrong affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which ſometimes are kindled in thee. <hi>Johns</hi> hearers did <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for an hour, a ſhort ſeaſon <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Rejoyce exceedingly,</hi> as in triumph, but when his Miniſtry began to touch them cloſe for their particular ſins, then they ſaid, <hi>He had a Devil:</hi> Now certainly God is alwaies the ſame, that which is good is alwaies as lovely, that which is ſinne is alwayes as abominable; Therefore thy affections ſhould be alwayes in the ſame manner carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out towards them. I might in many other particulars ſhew you, how God doth create a people unto that which is good? The term from which, and the term to which, Happy are the people who finde ſuch a change. What wondering was there when the Apoſtles were filled with the holy Ghoſt; ſo
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:30767:163"/>
                     <hi>that they all ſpake with ſtrange Tongues;</hi> No leſſe is it here. Thy tongue prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of, and praying to God, ſpeaks in a ſtrange tongue to what it did once, when lying and curſing came as ſo many ſparks of hell out of thy mouth. Oh when will God appear thus in his power, when will he bow the Heavens and come down?</p>
                  <p>Now the grounds why God takes ſuch untoward and indiſpoſed materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als <note place="margin">Gods reaſon or end in chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed people. 1.</note> to any thing that is good, and makes them complying with, and imbracing of his holineſſe, are</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>To ſhew forth the Glory of his Power and Grace.</hi> That which <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks concerning himſelf, whom he makes a monſter of men, and ſtileth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>The chiefest of all ſinners:</hi> Now (ſaith he) God converted him, that the <hi>exceeding riches of his grace might be made manifeſt to the ages to come.</hi> Gods Power and Goodneſſe is wonderfully revealed in this: His Power that he can ſubdue the hearts of men ſo averſe, and ſo oppoſitely bent: And his goodneſſe, that he will do it to ſuch enemies to him. That he ſhould ſurprize <hi>Paul</hi> in his journey to perſecute the people of God, with ſo much melting Grace, when he might have ſtruck him into Hell with the Thunder-bolt of his anger, This was unſpeakable Goodneſſe; ſo that upon this ground, the Miniſters of God may earneſtly importune God that he would turn their people from darkneſſe to light, O Lord, thou doſt all things for thy Glory! Now the more unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, unable and oppoſite men are to their own Salvation, the greater will thy glory be in helping of them; As <hi>David</hi> uſeth this as an Argument, that God would have mercy on him for his ſins are very great. Some indeed tranſlate it <hi>(Although)</hi> Thus we may urge, O Lord, Pity them and ſhew compaſſion to them, for they are a people cruel to their own ſouls; and therefore God hath many times choſen the worſt of men, that ſo his Goodneſſe may be the more remarkable. Thus (ſome ſay) the Jewes were the moſt brutiſh and blockiſh people in the world, yet God choſe them rather then any other to be his people. So the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> they were noted to a Proverb for wickedneſſe and uncleanneſſe: They had a Temple dedicated to <hi>Venus,</hi> and many Virgins were dedicated to her yearly to make Whores; And <hi>Coty</hi>'s the Heathen god for uncleanneſſe, was there worſhipped, yet God turneth theſe Beaſts into Saints, and ſweet Herbs come up where Brambles and Thorns did grow.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>God hath this end in this ſpiritual Creation, to ſhew his abſolute Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>and free Liberty in exerciſing his gracious Power upon what Subjects he pleaſeth.</hi> He doth not many times vouchſafe his Grace to thoſe that are civil and of a lovely converſation, nor to men alwaies of wiſdom and parts, as our Saviour acknowledgeth with the admiration of Gods wiſdome herein; <hi>Thou haſt hid thoſe things from the wiſe, and revealed them to Babes.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 11. doth profeſſedly diſpute Gods Dominion herein, <hi>Whom he will he chooſeth, and whom he will he hardeneth: And who are thou, O man, that diſputeſt with God?</hi> Gods Diſpenſation herein is wholly Arbitrary, and none may ſay unto God, Why doeſt thou ſo? Thus while the Apoſtles were preaching, it is ſaid, <hi>As many as were ordained to eternal life, believed,</hi> Act. 1. 48. <hi>And the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath obtained,</hi> Rom. 11. Hereupon it is that the Apoſtle doth ſo often put the godly in minde of their election, that hereby their hearts might be ſtirred up to all Thankfulneſſe; for what an overwhelming conſideration would this be to the gracious heart, to conſider of thoſe many thouſands lying in a lump of ſin, God ſhould chooſe thee among others, and leave the reſt in a periſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition!</p>
                  <p>A third end, <hi>Hereby God will for ever keep his New Creatures in Humility and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>ſelf-emptineſſe.</hi> For when we know, that Juſtification and Regeneration are Priviledges vouchſafed unto us, not for any Works we have done, for we were enemies to God; This keeps us in daily humble and low thoughts about our
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:30767:164"/>
ſelves: God hath ordained that way to Heaven, wherein he ſhall have all the Glory, and man take only ſhame and confuſion to himſelf. How can Pride and Vain-glory ever lodge in our hearts, when God onely makes us to differ from others, and we have nothing but what we have received? Hence the Apoſtle doth ſo often put the converted Saints in minde, what they were once, how they walked in all their groſſe waies of ſins and hainous crimes, as others did, till God had mercy on them, and this he doth to return all into grace. The remembrance of what thou wert once, how full of ſin, what an enemy to that which is good, may make thee cry out, <hi>Not unto us Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name belongs all glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The fourth end, <hi>Why God makes ſuch a glorious change upon his people, is to ingage them to more Service and Obedience.</hi> That as they have yeelded themſelves <note place="margin">4.</note> ſervants to ſinne, now ſervants to Righteouſneſſe: Men of great ſins, when converted, become men of great ſervices. Thus <hi>David,</hi> who ſinned above others, how active is he for Gods glory above others? <hi>Paul</hi> who perſecuted the Church more then all, when converted labours more then they all. This is a ſharp good to be more then an ordinary Saint, when a man hath been more then an ordinary ſinner. <hi>Peter</hi> that three times denied Chriſt, is three times called upon to <hi>feed Chriſts ſheep.</hi> The ground that was fruitful of weeds, when well ordered, becomes excellent for corn.</p>
                  <p>A fifth end is, <hi>Hereby God would provoke others to godlineſſe;</hi> For when we ſee that by Gods grace men of deſperate lives, and hopeleſſe converſations, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <note place="margin">5.</note> lovers of God and Godlineſſe, then what a ſhame will this be to others, who did not ſeem farre from the Kingdome of Heaven! Thus God is ſaid to provoke the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to jealouſie, for when they ſaw the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who knew not God, and lived in all darkneſſe and wickedneſſe, to become imbracers of Gods Worſhip; This was enough to ſtirre up Jealouſie in them. Thus alſo the Phariſees might have bluſhed to ſee the Publicans and Harlots entring the Kingdom of Heaven before them. Oh what a provocation ſhould this be to men, when they ſee men who were formerly averſe and contrary to what is good, now to rejoyce in it! When a <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> forſaketh her luſts, and cleaveth to Chriſt, what Harlots then will any longer ſtand out? When <hi>Paul</hi> an enemy makes much of that way he ſo hated once, How might this turn all the Phariſees? When therefore you ſee God working ſuch great things upon any man, ſay, The Lord doth this to provoke me, Shall ſuch repent and not I? Shall ſuch amend their waies, and I ſtand out ſtill?</p>
                  <p>Having thus explained the Doctrine, let us conſider what uſe may be made of this,</p>
                  <p>And firſt, Is it thus uſual with God, <hi>To raiſe ſtones to be children to Abraham,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> 
                     <hi>to make a barren wilderneſſe a pleaſant garden?</hi> then what Encouragement may the Miniſters of God have, where they ſee the greateſt oppoſition and averſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe? Alas God doth not finde men with a natural propenſity to good things, but he creates them. God doth not find men Lambs, but he makes Wolves Lambs; ſometimes where <hi>Paul</hi> had a minde to goe, hoping to doe good, the Spirit of God did prohibit him to goe, and at other times he is ſent to a people, that was not likely. This made the Prophet ſay, <hi>He was found of thoſe that ſought him not.</hi> We are with <hi>Abraham</hi> not to look to the dead womb of the Creatures, but to the mighty Power of God, who calleth things that are not, as if they were. It was <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſinne of unbelief, and for which only he was hindered from entring in <hi>Canaan,</hi> that when God bad him ſtrike the Rock, <hi>to have wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter guſh out,</hi> he was unwilling, and doubted whether God could doe it or no. Let not the Miniſters of God ſinne through unbelief, as if to God, the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of men were not poſſible, becauſe its impoſſible to men. When the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples had been ſiſhing all night, and catched nothing, Chriſt afterwards bids
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:30767:164"/>
them throw in their nets, and it was ſo full of fiſh that the net was in danger of breaking. So then let us be encouraged in our work, for all thoſe who are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to life in a Pariſh, they will believe, they will be converted at one time or other. And becauſe the Miniſters of God know not the ſecret counſels of God, therefore are we to preach to all, to wait patiently upon all, as if every one were to be ſaved. Therefore the Apoſtle exhorts us to <hi>inſtruct in patience and meekneſs, even thoſe that gainſay, if peradventure God may give them repentance,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 25. Though they are not ſure their inſtruction will do any good, there be a difficulty in it, yet they muſt not give over.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 2. To humble us under all the works of grace God vouchſafeth to us, <note place="margin">2.</note> for we made not our ſelves New Creatures: Oh take heed of all thoſe proud Doctrines that debaſe Grace, and ſet up mans Will, as alſo of all inward pride of Heart, glorying in any thing thou haſt. Did God revenge himſelf ſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Belſhazzar,</hi> becauſe in the pride of his heart, he boaſted, <hi>That that was great Babel which he had built;</hi> How much rather, if a man ſhould ſay, This is the Heaven I have merited, This is the eternal Glory I have purchaſed: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las look into thy by-paſt life, and what was there to move God to ſhew mercy unto thee? In ſtead of having God call thee ſo graciouſly to him, he might have pronounced that curſe, <hi>To depart into everlaſting fire. Pauls</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer wickedneſſe made him for ever humble and aſhamed in himſelf. And this is the main reaſon, why the good Works the godly do cannot juſtifie them, becauſe though they were for the preſent perfect, yet they could never abſolve from the guilt of our former ſinnes, we committed in ignorance of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 3. What cauſe a people loaden with grievous ſins, and rooted in them, <note place="margin">3.</note> have to cry mightily unto God, for his omnipotent power, for nothing can ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate thee and thy luſts, but that ſtrong arm of God which made Heaven and Earth, and raiſed Chriſt from the dead. In natural neceſſities there they apply themſelves to God, thinking nothing but his power can give rain, can ſtay the peſtilence, can ſheathe the ſword; and why then do you not alſo ſay, Oh its God only that can ſoften this heart of mine! that can humble this proud ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack of mine! Oh therefore pray unto God! ſaying, O Lord, Thy arm is not ſhortned! Art not thou he, who didſt turn <hi>Manaſſes</hi> his heart? Art not thou he who didſt convert ſo many thouſands at one Sermon? Oh put forth the ſame power, <hi>Draw us and we will run after thee,</hi> roll this ſtone away, and we ſhall praiſe thee!</p>

I proceed therefore to the final cauſe of this ſpiritual creation, and that is, <hi>To good works:</hi> In the Greek it is <hi>Created in good works.</hi> The final cauſe (ſaith <hi>Eraſmus)</hi> is not here ſignified, but the effect of grace creating: ſo that in his ſenſe the Holy Ghoſt ſhould not intend the end of creating us anew, but the effect of his grace, as if that did work all the good in us; and which is a wonder, <hi>Eſtius</hi> a Papiſt goeth this way, quoting <hi>Iſa</hi> 26. that place, <hi>O God thou haſt wrought all our works in us:</hi> It is much for him to do ſo, for this ſeemeth greatly to exclude the power of free will: But I rather take it for the final cauſe, and commend our tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators who render it, <hi>unto good works;</hi> and it is an Hebraiſm to uſe the Prepoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>in,</hi> for <hi>unto,</hi> although the Grecians alſo do ſo, as <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, for gains ſake, for a rewards ſake. There <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> denoteth a final cauſe, though indeed this is ſo the final cauſe, as that it is alſo the effect.</p>
                  <p>Obſ. <hi>That all thoſe who are new creatures, are created unto good works; ſo that a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obſerv.</hi> New creatures created unto good works.</note> 
                     <hi>godly life is a neceſſary fruit of their renovation.</hi> This new creature can be no more without an external godly converſation, then fire without heat, or hony without ſweetneſs. In ſome ſenſe it is more then the fruit of a tree; for a tree may live and grow, and yet bear no fruit; but this new creature cannot be, unleſs there be alſo thoſe good and holy works which God requireth of us. This point is of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment when ſo many ſatisfie themſelves with hopes of this glorious eſtate, &amp; yet their works are the works of the fleſh, and of darkneſs: As Chriſt ſaid of the falſe Prophets, <hi>By their fruit you may know them;</hi> ſo it is alſo true of falſe Chriſtians, by their fruit you may judge what they are.</p>
                  <p>For the underſtanding of this point, let us conſider what the phraſe implieth, <hi>Created to good works;</hi> and that comprehends,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>An inclination and propenſity to a godly life.</hi> For as God created all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with an inclination to their proper operations, thus this ſpiritual man is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued <note place="margin">1. What to be created to good works implieth</note> with a willing tendency unto thoſe actions that are heavenly. Thus as the ſparks flie upward, and the ſtone falls downward from an inward inclination of nature, ſo they are carried out to faith, repentance, holineſs, from a free principle within. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> defineth that to be the nature of every thing, which is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:30767:165"/>
of its motion, for its ſelf ſake, and not by accident: And thus natural moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons differ from violent, which are from a principle without, and by accident. Oh its a matter worthy of all your conſideration, to attend to the principle of your motions in holy things, whether it be natural or violent. You may read of <hi>Ahabs</hi> good works in ſome ſenſe, he prayed, and humbled himſelf, but he was not created to them, becauſe they were from a violent principle without, the judgements of God; not a natural principle within, which is a ſanctified and renewed heart: Yea, if you look upon <hi>Judas,</hi> you may ſee in ſome reſpects alſo his good works: there was his contrition, his confeſſion, and his ſatisfaction, but he was not created to theſe good works, becauſe extracted by ſlaviſh horror of conſcience, not ſweetly enclined thereunto by faith in God, and love of him. There is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the nurſes care of the child, and the mothers: The former doth it becauſe hired, and betruſted with it, but the latter from an inward <hi>ſtorgy,</hi> and maternal bowels: So then is it thus with thee? doſt thou pray, hear, live in all Godlineſs, as one that is created thereunto? One who hath a free voluntary inclination? in which reſpect the law of God is ſaid to be written in their in ward parts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>To be created to good works, implyeth not onely an inclination, but a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>readineſs, or preparedneſs, which is a further qualification.</hi> The fire hath an inclination to aſcend upwards, but yet ſomething may violently keep it down, that it cannot aſcend actually: Inclination to good works implieth the remote power, but rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs ſuppoſeth the proxime and immediate power. Gods own people who have the ſeed of Grace in them, yet how unprepared, and unready many times to that which is good! Therefore to watch and to be ready, is a duty ſo often preſſed; <hi>Be ready to every good work,</hi> and <hi>prepared to every good work:</hi> To this is oppoſite, dulneſs, ſluggiſhneſs, liſtleſneſſe, and all kind of weariſomneſs in the ſervice of God. But this ſhould quicken us up, <hi>That we are created to Godlineſs:</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the heart ſhould alwaies be ſwept and ready dreſſed for Chriſt to lodge in: you muſt have lamps and oyl; commonly ſin ſurpriſeth us, becauſe we are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for Godlineſs: Thus Chriſt knocked, deſirous to come in, but the Church was unwilling, and ſo deprived her ſelf of much comfort. Prayer is the Key of heaven, but if ruſty it will not open; and thus it is of all duties, if thy heart be not prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The phraſe, created to good works, doth denote them to be the principal and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>main end.</hi> God hath appointed every thing to an end, which holds not onely in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral agents, but alſo natural: Hence is that rule, <hi>Opera naturae ſunt opera intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> The works of nature are the works of reaſon and underſtanding, becauſe it ordereth, and wiſely directeth them to an end. Now as other creatures have their ends, ſo this new creature hath its, which is to be wholly imployed in thoſe works that are godly. This is his errand, his buſineſs and employment. The Apoſtles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is remarkable, <hi>Tit. 3. 8, 9. This is a faithful ſaying,</hi> and which thou art to affirm conſtantly, What is that? <hi>That thoſe who believe be careful to maintain good works:</hi> Two Greek words are obſervable <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that it be their care and ſtudy, and all their wiſedome, and then <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to maintain, or rather to be an example, and a preſident. The Apoſtle his ſcope is, that all Chriſtians ſhould make their houſes and families a ſchool-houſe, as it were, of a godly life, that there ſhould be no prophaneneſs, no filthy luſts, no ſcandals. That which the Apoſtle ſpeaks to <hi>Timothy,</hi> belongs to all, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to exerciſe himſelf unto Godlineſs; as he that is to run in a race, giveth himſelfe wholly to that: ſo that hell is not more oppoſite to heaven, then their lives are to this new creature, who live in a conſtant way of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety and manifeſt wickedneſs. The fruits of the fleſh are manifeſt, ſaith the Apoſtle, Every man that liveth in obedience thereunto, may preſently diſcern he is not a new creature. Oh then, when thou art overtaken with any evil ungodly way, ſay, Is this the good work God created me unto? Is this the Godly action he made me for? God did not make thee to eat and drink, much leſſe to riot and revel it, but to walk holily, righteouſly, and ſoberly; and let the Godly when at any time unwilling,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:30767:166"/>
and indiſpoſed to that which is good, ſtir up themſelves to all chearfulneſs, ſaying, <hi>For this end God created me anew; for this end I came into the world,</hi> How can I neglect the main buſineſs I have to do?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>It implieth conſtancie and perpetuity.</hi> That which we are created unto, is not once or twice to be thought on, or practiſed; but it is the conſtant imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a man. All natural actions are conſtant; The fire doth alwaies aſcend, the ſtone doth alwaies deſcend: and thus he that is righteous, doth righteouſneſs, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. 29. ſaith the Apoſtle: This diſcovereth the hypocriſie of thoſe who are uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and in ſome fits onely for good actions. In time of fear and danger, then they will do good, bewail their ſins, promiſe reformation; but this bulruſh that hangs down its head for a while, becauſe of ſome ſtorm falling upon it, after a fair day doth preſently perk up again, <hi>Gal. 6. 9. Let us not be weary in well doing;</hi> let us not faint or ſwound by any diſcouragements or oppoſitions, but remember a good action will alwaies meet with a good reward, which grace will Crown it with. How many are almoſt perſwaded to take up a godly and holy life, but preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly return to their vomit again!</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Here is univerſality of good works.</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks indefinitely, created to good works, and that is equivalent to an univerſal where the matter is neceſſary: He doth not ſay, created to ſome good works, or this and that good work, but good works in the general. If a man be ſtudious for all the good works of the ſecond Table that relate to man, as the works of righteouſneſs, liberality, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and love, &amp;c. if negligent in the good works that relate to the firſt Table, of piety, worſhip of God in Truth and ſincerity, keeping his Sabbath, zealous for his glory, fearing an Oath; this man is but for ſome good works, and ſo not created by God, which is univerſal. Again, if a man be zealous for the works of piety and religion, but careleſſe in the duties of juſtice, equity, truth to men, of brotherly love and liberality to thoſe that are in neceſſities, as far as it is his duty, he alſo is to doubt whether he be created to good works; for Gods grace createth to one as well as to another.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>It doth not onely ſuppoſe us inclining and ready to them, but zealouſly to purſue them.</hi> Thus they are called a peculiar people, <hi>zealous of good works;</hi> zeal is an hot burning affection, compounded partly of grief, becauſe we are hindered in what we would do; partly of anger againſt that which oppoſeth us; and partly of vehement love, which carrieth us out to that we deſire. Thus the godly are greatly grieved, becauſe of that relique and remainder of corruption which makes them not to do the good they would, as <hi>Paul</hi> bitterly complaineth. They are alſo angry at thoſe luſts which have the greateſt power over them: And laſtly, hot burning love to the glory of God, whom they do honour, and deſire to exalt continually. And as zeal breeds jealouſie, ſo it doth alſo in the godly breaſt: Their zeal to that which is holy makes them jealous, leſt at any time ſin ſhould deceive them, or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan ſeduce them. Thus <hi>Job</hi> made a covenant with his eyes, and <hi>David ſet a watch before his mouth,</hi> and <hi>Paul kept down his body,</hi> and all out of a godly jealouſie, leſt though they had gone ſo far in the way of holineſs, their feet at laſt ſhould be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the way.</p>
                  <p>Having thus explained the phraſe, <hi>Created to good works,</hi> let us conſider what they are; For there is a wo to him that calls evil good, and good evil. <hi>Jonah</hi> thought he did well to be angry: it is a great degree to do good works, when we know what they are: And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Thoſe onely are good works which are commanded by God, and conformable</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. What works are good works</note> 
                     <hi>to the rule laid down in the Scripture.</hi> So that as the definition of ſin is, <hi>That it is the tranſgreſſion of the law,</hi> thus the definition of a good work is, <hi>That it is a conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the law of God.</hi> The word of God is the Rule, the Canon; and as the Artificer can draw no good line which is not commenſurate to the rule, ſo whatſoever thou doſt which is not agreeable to Scripture, which is not anſwerable to that pattern, it is not good a work how glorious ſoever it be. This is an excellent truth to be inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:30767:166"/>
on: As that onely is true Doctrine which is agreeable to the Scriptures, ſo that onely is a good work which is anſwerable to the ſame rule. The Scriptures are a rule of faith, and of manners alſo: and as we ſay in matters of religion, <hi>Non credo, quia non lego,</hi> I do not believe it, becauſe I do not read it in Gods word, ſo <hi>Non ago, quia non lego praeceptum,</hi> I do it not, becauſe not commanded. And this cuts off moſt of thoſe works from being good works, which are ſo magnified in popery. what are their good works, for which they call a man a religious man, a ſpirituall man, a perfect man? Are they not vowed poverty, chaſtity, and blind obedience, with many other ſuperſtitious uſages? Now as the Phariſees thought their waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and humane commandments in religion good and glorious works, when yet our Saviour diſdaineth them upon this reaſon, <hi>Who hath required theſe things at your hands?</hi> Even ſo all thoſe good works of ſuperſtition, will-worſhip, traditional cuſtomes, though dignified with the title of good works, yet are to be rejected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not required: So that as counterfeit coyn is ſo far from being owned as cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant mony, that he who is found guilty of the making of it, is adjudged to death. So all counterfeit worſhip and ſervice of God which hath not the ſtamp of the Word upon it, is ſo far from being acceptable with God, that ſuch without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and reformation are condemned to eternal death. Herein certainly people fouly miſtake; they judge things to be good by the cuſtome of them, by the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and profit of them, and not by the rule of goodneſs. How could vain, and prophane ſports be accounted good works, if men did look into the Scripture for their goodneſſe? Thou ſayeſt, <hi>It is good for me to do thus, to live thus, to take up ſuch a courſe of life,</hi> but doth the Scripture ſay, it is alſo good? Thus as for want of this rule we take up many things for good, which are not good; ſo again, we reject ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny good works as folly, needleſſe, not requiſite, becauſe we do not ſtudy herein. To live ſtrictly, to be ſingular to the common waies of the world; to keep up holy family-duties, theſe things we look not upon as good works, becauſe they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our corrupt affections and luſts: Eſpecially how hardly can we be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that it is a good work to confeſſe Chriſt in the midſt of a crooked Generation; that it is good for us to love Chriſt more then Father, or Mother, or life it ſelf, that it is good to take up the Croſſe and follow him. How hardly do we perſwade our ſelves theſe are good works? That may be a good work which is grievous and evil to fleſh and blood: In matters to be done, How often do we judge the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of them, by the ſafety and advantage? If <hi>Paul</hi> had thus conſulted with fleſh and blood, he would not have thought it a good work to preach up that to his great danger, which once he ſo vehemently oppoſed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Good works are ſuch actions as we are enabled to by the grace of God.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Such acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as we are inabled unto by the grace of God.</note> God is ſaid <hi>to be the Author of every good, and perfect gift,</hi> James 1. No man unleſſe enabled and ſanctified by the ſpirit of God can do the leaſt good work; as a beaſt is not able to act the things of reaſon: For <hi>the imaginations of a mans heart are onely evil, and that continually,</hi> Gen. 6. ſo that there is not room for the leaſt good therein. How then muſt man plunged in ſinne ſay, he is not good, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can do good? The tree muſt be good, elſe the fruit cannot be good; and thus a man muſt be ingraffed in Chriſt, and partake of his fatneſſe, elſe all is but a wilde Olive, and wilde Grapes. And upon this ground it is, that the Orthodox maintain that poſition againſt Papiſts, That all the works of unregenerate men are ſins, as they come from them. Though <hi>Amaſiah</hi> and <hi>Jehu</hi> do thoſe things which are right in Gods eyes for the matter of them, yet in reſpect of circumſtances, they exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fail, and ſo they are made ſins to them. Whereupon is that neceſſary diſtinction, That an action may be ſaid to be good materially for the matter of it: Thus when a wicked man prayeth, heareth, he doth that which is good for the matter; or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, that is, when they are done upon ſuch principles, in ſuch a manner, and to ſuch an end as God requireth: So that to do a good work there is requiſite the help of Gods ſpirit to lift us up. As <hi>Zacheus</hi> was too low of himſelf to ſee Jeſus, he was fain to go up into a tree; ſo we are too too ſhort to reach unto any good work; it is
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:30767:167"/>
above our reach till the ſpirit of God lift us up. Oh that unregenerate men did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this Truth as ingraffed in their ſouls; I have lived thus long and have not done one good work, <hi>yet</hi> I have been without Chriſt, deſtitute of his ſpirit, &amp; ſo a branch ſeparated from the vine: Oh how little, or no hope at all have I! What ſhall I do? Have pity upon me all ye that know me, and pray for me: not one good work in all my life time! but a continual ſinning hath run through my converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And this every unregenerate man muſt ſay, though not prophane, but very ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and ingenuous, yet if not a new creature, he is not created to any good work. We are created to it: our free will or moral education cannot prepare us for them; ſo that though the name of good works be often in our mouths, yet the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions themſelves are rarely performed, becauſe few are endued with the ſpirit of God. Hence that is called the holy Spirit, becauſe without it there is no holineſs; as there is no light from the heavens but by the ſun, the ſtars ſhining, as they ſay, by its light.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Good works are ſuch which have the concurrence of all circumſtances:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. And that have the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of all circumſtances.</note> There muſt be a good cauſe, a good manner, a good end, and if any one of theſe be wanting, it is not a good work. <hi>Bonum eſt ex integrâ cauſâ: Uzzah</hi> did not a good work, for God was ſo diſpleaſed, that he ſtruck him dead ſuddenly for it, though he had a very good intention, and all becauſe the manner was not good. <hi>Cains</hi> Sacrifice was not doing well, for then he had been accepted, as God told him, becauſe his perſon was not good: So that it is eaſie to commit evil, but diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to do that which is good, becauſe a man muſt every time hit the mark; if he fails in one circumſtance, if one ſtring be broken, the muſical harmony is ſpoiled. Oh what a rouſing Truth is this? How ſhould this chaſe away all ſecurity, all truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in thy good heart, and good works? For where are they? God indeed looked on all he did, and ſaw they were exceeding good; but mayſt not thou look over all thou didſt ever ſince thou waſt born, and ſee all exceeding evil? You think you do good works, but it is ignorance; you know not how many things are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a good action, and one dead fly ſpoileth the whole box of oyntment. This bitter herb makes death in the duty, which otherwiſe would bring life. This made the Pſalmiſt pronounce of every man by nature, <hi>There is none that doth good, no not one.</hi> What an uncharitable cenſure doth this ſeem to be in humane reaſon? <note place="margin">Pſal. 14. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>None doth good,</hi> not one in all mankinde till quickened and enlivened by grace. I beſeech you lay this deep in your hearts; <hi>I am good for no good work:</hi> I am wholly evil, and all that I do is wholly evil. <hi>Paul</hi> that had ſome good in him, becauſe of the mixture of evil, cryed out, <hi>O miſerable man that I am, Who will deliver me?</hi> how much rather have I cauſe to bid all comforts ſtand aloof off, and to be alone, crying out, <hi>Who will deliver me?</hi> ſeeing I am nothing but evil, nothing but ulcers and ſores all over me. There is nothing will ſooner drive you out of ſelf-love, make you amazed at your ſelves, and cauſe you to cry out, <hi>Help Lord, elſe we periſh,</hi> as to think, not one good work hath ever been done by us yet.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Good works muſt flow from a good heart within.</hi> From a purified Fountain <note place="margin">4. A good work muſt flow from a good heart.</note> and ſweet, do iſſue ſweet ſtreams: When <hi>Moſes</hi> vehemently required of the people of Iſrael, <hi>to obey the commands of God,</hi> which was nothing but to do good works; the people preſently made a ready promiſe, that they would do all: But mark what <hi>Moſes</hi> replyeth, <hi>Oh that there were ſuch an heart in them;</hi> this is all: It is not for thee to ſay and promiſe, <hi>I will ſet upon a good life, I will be diligent in good duties:</hi> But oh that there were ſuch an heart in you. Hence our Saviour compareth the good heart of a man <hi>to a good treaſure from whence all things flow.</hi> Thus that great promiſe of regeneration firſt begins with the heart, <hi>I will take away the heart of ſtone and give an heart of fleſh; and I will write my law in the inward parts,</hi> Ezek. 36. and what then? <hi>Then I will make them to walk in my commandments:</hi> Thus alſo the commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and ſoul,</hi> &amp;c. As the wickedneſſe of an evil man lyeth moſt in his heart, ſo the goodneſſe of a good man is moſt in the heart. Now this particular alſo is not attended to; men
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:30767:167"/>
never looking any further then the work they do, Is that a Duty? Is that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded? but not attend to, with what inward rectitude and purity of ſpirit they do theſe things. The difference of the third and fourth hearers, lay not in externals at firſt, but that one had a good and honeſt heart, which the other wanted; &amp; although men look to the outward good works, yet God looketh moſt to the inward good heart: Therefore the hypocrite doth no good work, though he ſeemeth to the world full of good works, becauſe his heart is not good. Our Saviour inſtanced in this, and preſſed it much upon the Phariſees, ſaying, <hi>They were wolves within, and noiſome ſepulchers within, though painted without.</hi> Think therefore thou heareſt God ſpeaking unto thee that of <hi>Solomon, My ſon, give me thy heart,</hi> Prov. 23. 26. thy good heart, elſe thoſe good works are but a blaze, there is no good foundation.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Good works are thoſe, and thoſe onely which are done for the glory of God.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5. And be done to the glory of God.</note> Let any action be in it ſelf never ſo neceſſary, ſo glorious, ſo profitable to others, yet if it be not for Gods glory, there is a wo to ſuch good works inſtead of an <hi>Euge,</hi> or <hi>well done.</hi> The Phariſees prayers, faſtings, and alms, have a wo and threatning an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to them in ſtead of a promiſe. <hi>Whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God:</hi> now vain glory and ſelf-applauſe, is a worm that quickly breeds in the beſt fruit, in the choyceſt actions: The godly at the day of judgement do not know the good works they did; as the ſilk-worm hideth it ſelf within the curious ſilk it works, whence was that Motto upon it, <hi>Operitur dum operatur, She is all over covered whilſt ſhe works:</hi> The ſame ought we to be in all the holy duties, and moſt heavenly actions we perform; <hi>Operimur dum operamur:</hi> upon this reaſon <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, <hi>All the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous actions of the heathens were but</hi> ſplendida peccata, <hi>gliſtring ſins,</hi> becauſe they cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted their love to their countrey by vain glory, and ſo they did, as he ſaid, <hi>Unam cupiditatem aliâ ſanare, Heal one ſin by another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Uſe of Exhortation, To take up that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Let every man try his own</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> 
                     <hi>work.</hi> The word ſignifieth ſuch a tryal as the Goldſmith uſeth about his Gold, whether it be right or no: He hath his Touch-ſtone to diſcover it. Let this be your care; thouſands and millions of works you have done in your life time, bring them all to the Touch-ſtone, the Scripture, the rule of goodneſs. It is not an eaſie matter to be found doing but one good work: Inform and inſtruct your ſelf better about the Doctrine of a good work, how much the Scripture requireth; and certainly if there be any ſparklings of conſcience, it will make thee fear all the works thou haſt done. For what? doſt thou call thy ungodlineſſe, thy prophane courſes, good works? Doth Gods word command theſe? Doth Gods Spirit enable thee to do theſe? Oh blind man, hood winked by the divel, that doſt not ſee thy ſelf all over plunged into evil! But it may be thou thinkeſt thy prayers, thy duties, thy civility, thy charity, good works, and indeed theſe are good for the matter of them, but as thou doſt them who art not regenerated, who haſt not the ſpirit of Chriſt dwelling in thee, who haſt corrupt and ſinful ends, they all are thy evil works, and come in the catalogue of thy other ſins. Thy duties not done by a gracious heart, through gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious power, to a gracious end, in a gracious manner, are ſins to thee as well as thy other ungodly waies. I know the proud and ſelf-flattering heart of man loveth not to hear this, cannot endure that all its gold ſhould be diſcovered to be droſs. But it is not what thou thinkſt, and what others think about thy good works, but what Gods ſpirit pronounceth in his word: how great wil thy confuſion be, if that which thou calleſt a good heart, a good life, and good works, all good, God ſhall diſcover to be an evil heart, an evil life, all evil! God cannot be deceived, but thou art eaſily.</p>

                     <p>Setting forth divers diſtinctions, and Axioms to clear the Doctrine of good works.</p>
                  </argument>

                     <bibl>EPHES. 2. 10.</bibl>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>GOod works (you have heard) are the inſeparable and neceſſary fruit of this <note place="margin">Divers expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natory rules to be conſidered of about good works. 1. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks ſometimes in diſpraiſe of them.</note> 
                     <hi>New creature.</hi> It hath alſo been informed you, what a good work is. I ſhall at this time lay down ſome diſtinctions, or neceſſary Axioms to clear this Doctrine about <hi>Good works,</hi> and ſo proceed to application.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, <hi>This is worth your obſervation, That the Scripture ſpeaketh ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in praiſe and worth of them, ſometimes again by way of diminution, and debaſing of them.</hi> When good works are compared with the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, or have relation to juſtification, then they are rejected as unable for any ſuch uſe. Thus the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Our righteouſneſs is like a menſtruous cloth,</hi> Iſa. 30. 22. How loathſom is that? and ſo are our holy duties if <hi>God ſhould enter into judgement with us. Juſtitia noſtra eſt indulgentia tua Domine, O Lord, our righteouſneſs is thy indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence:</hi> Our juſtification conſiſts in pardon; therefore we have no perfection to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie us, but imperfection to be forgiven us. Thus the Apoſtle alſo, <hi>He doth account</hi> (and that is an act of judgement and deliberation) <hi>all things but dung and droſs in compariſon of the righteouſneſs by faith in Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3. 8. So then when the beſt works we do are conſidered in the Court of juſtification, there they are damnable, and have ſo much droſs in them, that God doth reject them as inſufficient. They are not good, but bad works in that ſenſe. Therefore a man in juſtification is looked upon as a ſinner, without a righteouſneſs anſwering the Law, though at that time alſo he doth repent and believe. <hi>But then at other times the Scripture ſpeaks of good works in reſpect of ſanctification, and as they relate to the glory of God, and are an orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to our holy profeſſion.</hi> And in this ſenſe the word of God doth often commend them, and exhort to them. So that if thou haſt got ſo much skill as to know in what ſenſe the Scripture debaſeth them, and in what ſenſe it commends them, bleſs God for that knowledge, and look upon it as a ſtar to guid thee. The Apoſtle in this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter, <hi>attributing our whole ſalvation to grace,</hi> leſt he ſhould be thought therefore to exclude good works, and it were all one whether we were prophane or godly, he addeth, <hi>That we are created to good works.</hi> Take heed of Popery to make thy good works a ground of juſtification; take heed of Antinomianiſm, to deny the preſence of them.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond rule is, <hi>That good works are not to be limited to one kind, but are to be</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Good works are to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as far as Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</note> 
                     <hi>extended as far as the Law of Gods commands.</hi> Thus the Obedience to the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment is a good work, to the ſecond, &amp; ſo to every one; for the Law is a rule of good works, and as the Logicians ſay, <hi>There is no created being, but it is reduced into
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:30767:168"/>
one of the ten predicaments:</hi> So there is no duty or good work commanded of us, but it is contained in one of thoſe Ten words, as <hi>Moſes</hi> calls them: A word is there uſed for a Precept, as often in the Hebrew. This is good to be obſerved, that ſo we may be conſcionable and abounding in every good work. Good works are works of piety, works of righteouſneſs, works of charity: Every work that comes from a good cauſe, commanded by the rule of goodneſs, performed in a good manner, to a good end, is a good work, whether the object matter be God or man; and howſoever uſe hath almoſt appropriated the phraſe <hi>Good works, to thoſe of charity,</hi> yet the Scripture extendeth it to all the good fruits of a godly life: And in the Scripture ſenſe, no man can do one good work, which hath not a principle to do all. Godly obedience is copulative, and he that doth a good work, becauſe God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it, will do all becauſe God commands it. This conſideration would make us not like <hi>Herod, to do many things,</hi> but like <hi>Zachary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth, To walk in all the commandments of God,</hi> Luke 1. 6. Thou prayeſt and heareſt, becauſe this good work God commandeth: Oh thou, fool, Doth not God alſo command thee to be chaſt, to be ſober, to be heavenly minded? The graces of God are chained together; he that hath one, hath all: and therefore it is to be wondered at, to ſee what hypocriſie may be in a mans heart to be affected with ſome good works; he could have no peace in his conſcience if he ſhould omit them, and yet can totally neglect others without any remorſe at all: If thou hadſt committed murther, the guilt of blood would torment thy conſcience, torture thy ſoul. Why ſhould not uncleanneſſe, curſing, do the like? Doth not the ſame God that ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not Kill,</hi> ſay alſo, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Another rule about works is that of</hi> Auſtins, <hi>founded alſo upon the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. They go not before juſtified perſons but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after.</note> 
                     <hi>Scripture, good works do not go before a juſtified perſon, but follow after,</hi> Bona ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra non praecedunt juſtificationem, ſed ſequuntur. This Text doth clearly aſſert this Truth, <hi>We are ſaved of Grace, not by works,</hi> becauſe we are Created to them, being his Workmanſhip. It is not in Divinity, as the Philoſophers ſay in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, <hi>Bona agendo ſumus boni, By doing good works, we are made good;</hi> No, we are by grace made good, then we do good: As the Fountain muſt be before the ſtream, and the root or tree before the fruit. Thus our Saviour, Make the tree good, and then the fruit will be good. Thus <hi>Abels</hi> perſon is firſt accepted, then his performances: This Truth is of great concernment, it being inbred in men to look more to an outward good work, then the goodneſſe of their perſons and natures. They do not imitate God, who is good in his nature, and then doth good in his Actions; ſo ought we to be good, and then to do good. Therefore by this rule thus ſetled upon Scripture, it is an undoubted Truth, That no man till juſtified and regenerated, is able to do any good work: He is a leper, all is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, and every thing he toucheth he maketh unclean to himſelf. This ſhould make us ſit down on the dunghill with <hi>Job,</hi> abhorring our ſelves, when there is none of all mankind of himſelf can do good, no, not one. What Doctrine may make us loath our ſelves, and ſeek out for a new creation, and ingraffing into Chriſt, if this doth not?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The next rule is, That then in Scripture things are ſaid to be,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. In Scripture things are ſaid to be when they are made manifeſt.</note> 
                     <hi>when they are made manifeſt, and apparent.</hi> And this rule will open the ſenſe of all that diſcourſe in the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> where he diſputeth it by ſeveral argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>That we are juſtified by works.</hi> In ſo much that it hath much exerciſed the learned, how <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James</hi> are to be reconciled; For <hi>Paul,</hi> he expreſly proveth that juſtification is without works; and that <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified by faith onely: and <hi>James</hi> he ſaith, <hi>Abraham was not juſtified by faith onely, but by works:</hi> Now two things reconcile theſe brethren that ſeem to differ. Firſt <hi>Paul,</hi> He proveth that faith onely juſtifieth; and <hi>James,</hi> That this faith which ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth is not alone, ſeparated from <hi>Good works. Paul</hi> proveth what it is that juſtifieth, <hi>Uiz.</hi> Faith; and <hi>James,</hi> what kinde of Faith, <hi>Uiz.</hi> a working live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:30767:169"/>
faith. <hi>Paul</hi> argueth againſt a Phariſee that thought his works would juſtifie him, and <hi>James</hi> againſt a Carnall Goſpeller that thought faith alone, in the meer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of it, was enough to ſave, without a godly life. And ſecondly, it may be thus compoſed; <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of the nature of juſtification in it ſelf, and <hi>James</hi> of the manifeſtation of it. A thing in Scripture being ſaid to be then done, when it is diſcovered to be ſo: And thus when you read in <hi>James</hi> in ſeverall places, <hi>That a man is juſtified by Good works,</hi> that is, he is manifeſted to be ſo. As the Apoſtles ſimilitude evinceth, when he ſaith, <hi>As the body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſoul is dead, ſo is faith without works.</hi> Now as the body doth not give life to the ſoul, but fetcheth all from it, and doth outwardly declare what the ſoul doth; ſo doth a Godly life manifeſt and declare who are juſtified, and who not. So that it is in vain to pretend a good heart, where there is not a good life. And this is the reaſon why God in the Commandements requireth the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward work, becauſe that doth demonſtrate to the world the frame of the heart.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>We are alwaies to diſtinguiſh between good works, in the truth of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5. We muſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween good works in the truth of them and in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of them</note> 
                     <hi>them, and in the perfection of them.</hi> The Godly are created to the Truth of Good works in this life, but to the perfection of them in the life to come. As he ſaid, <hi>I believe, Lord help my unbelief:</hi> So it is true of every other Grace; Lord, I love thee, help my want of love: Lord, I am humble, help my want of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. No man goeth beyond <hi>Paul,</hi> who when he would do good, found evil preſent with him. And the Apoſtle declareth a perpetual oppoſition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict between the fleſh and the ſpirit: So that the Godly cannot do the good things they would; ſo that this Truth will direct two ſorts of perſons, Firſt thoſe that are ignorant, full of ſelf-flattery, and ſelf-righteouſneſſe; they are apt to take a ſhadow for the ſubſtance: every thing that gliſters for Gold, whatſoever is good for the matter of it, to take it for good in all the circumſtances of it. And then ſecondly, There are the Godly ones who are ready to conclude nothing is good in them, becauſe not perfectly good. They think this action comes ſhort of that perfect rule; and is not anſwerable to the glorious Majeſty of God: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they do not own that goodneſſe in them which God owneth in them, and hereby walk not in that thankfulneſſe, chearfulneſſe, and exemplary joy as they ought to do.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>This is the true character of a new creature, That he is as zealous and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6. The New Creature is as diligent as if works would ſave him, and yet as fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies on Chriſt as if there were not the leaſt good in him.</note> 
                     <hi>of good works, as if they were to ſave him, as if there were no Chriſt, no grace to rely upon: and yet on the other ſide he doth as fully and really rely upon Christ, and his grace, as if there were not the leaſt spark of any goodneſſe in him.</hi> This is a Scripture and admirable temperament, To joyn thoſe places of Scripture together, <hi>Work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling;</hi> and yet when you have done all, ſay, <hi>Ye are unprofitable ſervants.</hi> When ye have done all, if that were poſſible, how much rather muſt we ſay ſo, when we come far ſhort of all! That which doth ſo puzzle corrupt and erronious heads, he can practically recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods promiſe to give, and mans duty to do. He ſo believeth in Chriſt, that yet he is not barren of Godly and holy works; and he ſo practiſeth theſe, that his faith is not taken off from making Chriſt all in all. To ſome men we may ſay that of <hi>Luther, Take heed not onely of thy evil works, but of thy good alſo, Uiz.</hi> do not truſt in them, be not proud of them; To others, that of <hi>John Huſſe, Ubi opera non apparent ad extra, ibi non eſt fides ad intra, Where Godlineſs is not in the fruit, there faith is not in the root;</hi> where the body doth not move or ſtir, there is no ſoul within.</p>
                  <p>Now becauſe I did not intend to dwell long on this part of the Text, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the comfort and profit of a good work, lyeth not in the Doctrine and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, but in the practice and exerciſe, I ſhall therefore be large in the Uſe, and ſo conclude this point.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> Firſt, <hi>Is it a neceſſary fruit of a new creature to walk in good works? then
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:30767:169"/>
the evil and ungodly deeds of moſt in the Chriſtian world, ſheweth that they are in that old damnable condition they were born in.</hi> If we conſider the general converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of moſt men, What deeds of darkneſſe, and of ſin and Satan may be found in them? That which <hi>Salvian</hi> complained of the lives of Chriſtians in his daies, may not we alſo take up? <hi>Praeter pauciſſimos quoſdam, quid eſt aliud omnis catus Chriſtianorum, quam ſentina vitiorum? Beſides a very few that fly ſins, and endeavour to keep themſelves unſpotted from the world, What is the whole company of Chriſtians, but a ſink of all vices?</hi> You may ſooner finde men <hi>reos malorum omnium, quam non omnium, You may ſooner finde men guilty of all ſins, then of ſome onely,</hi> And <hi>Facilius majorum criminum, quam minorum, And ſooner men guilty of the greater crimes, then of the leſſe;</hi> yea, he addeth, almoſt all the whole Church is brought to ſuch a reproach and ſcandal of manners, <hi>ut incuncto populo Chrrſtiano genus quoddam ſanctitatis ſit, minus eſſe vitioſum, That in all the Chriſtian world it is a kinde of holineſs to be leſſe vitious.</hi> Doth he not ſpeak as if he lived in our times? For except ſome few in every Congregation, which are like the Glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to the harveſt; are not people generally ignorant, prophane, ungodly, ſo that it is a kind of great holineſſe to be leſſe wicked then others? His Oaths not ſo dreadful, his malice not ſo rancorous, his drunkenneſſe not ſo beaſtly: If men be leſſe wicked, we are apt to judge them virtuous men, ſuch a deluge of ſin doth o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow: But oh the patience of God who beholds and ſeeth all this ingratitude, rebellion, and hoſtility againſt his Majeſty, yet forbeareth to take preſent ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance.</p>
                  <p>Now there are many arguments why you ſhould take heed of theſe evill works.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Thy evil deeds of ſin, brings Gods evil work of puniſhment.</hi> Is there evil <note place="margin">1. Why we ſhould take heed of evil works.</note> in the City, or in the Land, <hi>ſaith the godly Prophet,</hi> and I have not done it? <hi>Amos 3. 6. viz.</hi> an evil of puniſhment: But why? Becauſe men have firſt done their evil works. Thou that thinkeſt Gods judgements of Plague, Famine, and the devouring ſword to be very grievous and evil; Why doſt thou not conſider thy evil waies, which have procured theſe things? Your iniquities with-hold good things from you. And the Prophets are alwaies diligent in the middeſt of Gods judgements brought upon a people, ſtill to remember them of thoſe iniquities, which have been like the vapours mounted up to the heavens, and afterwards congealed, fall down in terrible Thunder and lightening: Oh therefore if thou findeſt not God ſo good to thee or the publick, as thou deſireſt, conſider it is the evil of thy waies that brings all calamities.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Therefore let thy life be free from all evil works, becauſe thy profeſſion of Chriſtianity obligeth thee to it.</hi> How can an holy profeſſion, and an unholy life <note place="margin">2.</note> accord together? How can darkneſs and light be reconciled? When God whom thou ſerveſt is holy, Chriſt by whoſe name thou art called is holy, the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances whereby thou draweſt high him are holy; when all this is holy, How is thy converſation ſo wicked and unholy? For a prophane man full of evil deeds, to pray, and hear, is as loathſom as for the ſow wallowing in its mire, to come and rowl it ſelf in a pleaſant garden. That place is obſervable, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. where the Apoſtle having ſpoken of ſome wretched Apoſtates from the Truth of Chriſt, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>Nevertheleſs the foundation of God standeth ſure.</hi> As men who build glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous palaces lay a ſure foundation, ſo God being to build an eternal City, he layeth a deep and firm foundation. Now as their cuſtom was to write ſome ſhort and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſentences upon their foundation ſtones, as appeareth out of <hi>Zachary;</hi> ſo ſaith he, God hath ſet two Sentences upon his foundation: The one is, <hi>The Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thoſe that are his,</hi> i. e. he will effectually preſerve them from falling away. And the other is, <hi>Let every one that nameth the name of Christ, depart from iniquity.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve this, This ſentence is one of the choice ones that God will have inſcribed: Let every one that names Chriſt, takes his profeſſion on him, <hi>depart from iniquity.</hi> Take heed then of being Thiſtles in Chriſts garden: of being Tares in his wheat: This
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:30767:170"/>
is to mingle heaven and earth, yea heaven and hell together: either therefore lay aſide the name of a Chriſtian, or the works of an Heathen, and one who knoweth not God. <hi>Quid in meo eſtis, non mei? What do you who are not Gods, in Gods vine-yard?</hi> Why are you that are Goats, among Chriſts ſheep? Oh conſider what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach ye are to the holy name of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Conſider the Titles which the Scripture giveth evil works, and thoſe titles</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>wil demonſtrate the nature of them.</hi> They are called <hi>The works of the Divel,</hi> What can be a more horrid aggravation then to ſay, Thy luſts, thy ungodlineſſe, they are of thy ſelf, and they are of the Divel too? It is the Divel in thee, and by thee, who provokes thee to ſuch waies. Thus our Saviour bid <hi>Peter, Get thee behinde me Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, get thee behinde me Divel,</hi> Mat. 16. 23. Why? was <hi>Peter</hi> a <hi>Divel?</hi> No, but becauſe what he did came by the Divels inſtigation and temptation; therefore he uſeth that phraſe. Thus <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith to <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira, Why hath Satan filled thy heart, to lye against the holy Ghoſt? Act.</hi> 5. 3. and the Jewes or Phariſees are ſaid to be <hi>of their Father the Divel, for his works they do:</hi> and Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to come into the world to deſtroy the works of the Divel.</hi> Oh then remember thy ſelf, by whom, and from whom is it that thou art ſo prophane and ungodly? Is it not from the Divel? Doth not that unclean ſpirit ruling in thee, provoke thee to all uncleanneſſe? Thou wouldſt judge it an uncharitable cenſure to be called as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was, <hi>Thou child of the Divel;</hi> but yet every man living in that ungodly and unholy way, is ſo. Neither doth this excuſe them, as if they were juſtified, and all the blame to be laid on the Divel, no, for he works upon thy corrupt diſpoſition within. If thou wert not firſt tempted by thy own luſt, the divel could not be a tempter to thee: If thou wert not ſtubble, his fiery darts would not enflame thee. Conſider then all this, you who wallow in all mire and filth of ſin. If the Divels were to act viſibly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, and had bodily members to work withall, they would do as thou doſt: And further alſo remember that he who thus enticeth thee to all ſin, will be a tormenter afterwards unto thee, and will be an accuſer unto God againſt thee, for that which he hath excuſed unto thee; throw them then away, <hi>they are the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Again they are the works of darkneſs, as good works are the works of the light.</hi> A wicked man is in darkneſſe, and knoweth not whither he goeth. <hi>They are</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>works of Darkneſs,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 11. partly becauſe it is for want of light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that they are committed. If thou didſt know what the Scripture commands, if thou didſt know the will of God, and the happineſſe promiſed to the contrary thou doſt, thou wouldſt never live as thou liveſt. Again they are works of darkneſs, becauſe committed without fear and ſhame, men do not think God ſeeth them, that the revengeful eye of God is upon them. Oh the horror and confuſion that would be on their ſouls if this were attended to. And laſtly they are works of darkneſſe, becauſe they will be rewarded with utter darkneſſe. Thy ſin and thy pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment will be proportionable. Thou lovedſt darkeneſſe, and therefore thou ſhalt be thrown into utter darkneſſe. Oh that wicked and ungodly men ſhould be no more amazed at their dreadfull eſtate. <hi>In the next place, they are called the works of the fleſh, as good works the works of the spirit,</hi> Gal. 5. Of the fleſh, becauſe they come wholly from us corrupt and carnal; there is nothing of the Spirit of God in them: they are ſparks from that fire and brimſtone in thy bowels: they are ſo many drops of poyſon vented from thy venemous nature: and as they are thus works of the fleſh, ſo they work corruption as the fleſh it ſelf is corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>They that ſow to the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption,</hi> Gal. 6. 8. <hi>Again they are vain works,</hi> as the ſcripture calls them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 18. They are empty of that they promiſe: thou lookeſt for pleaſure, profit, advantage by them, but they bring the clean contrary: they have a gliſtering skin, but a ſting in the tail of them. With what curſes &amp; indignation wilt thou bid them be gone, which now thou doſt ſo embrace? All that momentany pleaſure, What is become of it? What is that drop of hony to that Ocean of Gall thou muſt for ever drink in hell?</p>

Is it according to Scripture that I live? Is my life good, according to the rule of goodneſſe? and when you would make inquiſition into your ſelves, and pronounce a ſentence accordingly, take heed of ſelf flattery, ſecurity and eaſe; but arraign thy ſelf at Gods Tribunal; compare thy life and the word together: That ſayeth, <hi>ſuch a life is good, ſuch actions are good:</hi> Is it thus with thee, or the clean contrary? Oh conſider, That God judgeth not as man judgeth. He judgeth according to the inwards; he tryeth the heart and reins, and accordingly judgeth thy actions which come thence. All the Titles you have, Chriſtians, Believers, Saints, Do not theſe engage to a godly life?

Our Saviour maketh a difference of two builders in Chriſtianity, both raiſe up and edifie, have a profeſſion, an outward from of Religion, but one buildeth upon ſands, and another upon the rock. Now he buildeth on ſands, whoſoever taketh up the way of Religion upon any worldly, carnal or corrupt principle: If it be built upon education, cuſtom, formality, this is like a ſtone not faſtned to the corner ſtone, and ſo a ſudden tempeſt will hurl it down; therefore <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. when the Apoſtle had prayed, that they might be ſtrengthened in the inward man (the words ſpoken of in my Text) he addeth, <hi>Rooted and grounded in love,</hi> in the love of Chriſt; till therefore thou art homogeneous with Chriſt, as it were, and doſt love him becauſe of holineſs and godlineſs ſake, thy heart is looſe and uncertain: If the tree had no rooting in the earth, it would be as ſubject to fall as any leaf it bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: If the ſhip be not anchored, its carried with every wind; ſo unleſs grace ſettle thee upon Chriſt, and thou cleave to him, there is no temptation but will hurry thee this way and that way: Even a reed that is apt to be ſhaken with every wind, if tyed to a rock, ſtands unmoveable; ſo thy heart natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe, deceitful, inconſtant, and full of treachery to God, if faſtned to Chriſt, then as Chriſt is the ſame yeſterday, and to day, ſo art thou; As the times did not, nor have not changed Chriſt, ſo neither will they thee, when grounded on him; if therefore you ſee men leaner in the ways of godlineſs then before, not ſo much in the practical exerciſe of Grace, it's becauſe they run as ſheep among the brambles and bryers of diſputes, and loſe their wool, they do not keep cloſe by faith to the live Tree, which would convey ſweet fulneſs: Happy therefore is that Chriſtian, who daily goeth out like that woman to touch Chriſt, that ſo he may finde vertue come from him to heal him: If thou haſt bottomed thy ſelf upon any thing but Chriſt, thou art not a pillar in the temple of the Lord, which cannot be removed, as is promiſed to the godly <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. 12.</p>

The <hi>Corinthians</hi> were very zealous of thoſe gifts and abilities, which brought them applauſe and eſteem among others, but negligent about love to God and mens ſouls, which is an effect of ſanctifying Grace; therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I will ſhew you a more excellent way,</hi> 1 Cor. 12. 5. And certainly, though it be laudable to inquire and try all things in the matter of Religion, yet there is a more excellent way, <hi>which is to hold faſt that which is good,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 21. Theſe and the like inſuing particulars, are the grounds and reaſons of the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe the proper end and uſe of all Doctrinal Principles, is to lead and</hi>

                     <hi>guide the heart into a practical exerciſe of Grace:</hi> Therefore all the while a man doth imploy his head, and his heart not ſanctified, he falls ſhort of the end of all Religious principles; <hi>If ye know theſe things,</hi> ſaith our Savior, <hi>happy are ye if ye do them,</hi> John 13. 17. Happineſs lieth not in the knowing of them, but do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them. Divinity is practical, even as the art of Medicine; for a man doth not attain health by reading <hi>Galen,</hi> or knowing <hi>Hippocrates</hi> his <hi>Aphoriſms,</hi> but by the practical application of them to remove his diſeaſes: Hence you have that notable expreſſion, <hi>The acknowledgement of the truth, which is after godlineſs,</hi> Tit. 1. 1, If thou doeſt not acknowledge God, Chriſt, and all other matters of Religion after godlineſs, thou miſſeſt the mark: But yet we ſee this vanity upon men, that they know onely to know, as it is ſaid of one people, that they had money onely to tell it, they made no other uſe of it. To eat meat, and not to digeſt it, is like getting knowledge, and not follow it into practice. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is ſo ordained for, and relating to practice, that all wicked men are ſaid not to know God, becauſe though they have a general knowledge, yet they improve
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:30767:175"/>
it not in a particular application. If then <hi>Solomon</hi> obſerved it as a great vanity in the world, that God gave ſome men riches, and yet they had no power to uſe them, <hi>Eccles.</hi> 5. 19. how much more is it to have great intellectual abilities, and continual exerciſes of the underſtanding, and in the mean while to have no power to make uſe of them for the good of their ſouls: To be often eating of the tree of knowledge, but never to taſte of the tree of life. The very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, though they had but ſome few ſparks of a true knowledge about God, having no other Book but that of nature to learn by, yet in how grievous a meaſure are they puniſhed by God, becauſe they did not live according to their knowledge, neither did they glorifie God as they knew him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. So then, though thou ſheweſt thy ſelf a rational man, and not a beaſt, in that thou ſearcheſt into the grounds and reaſons of thy Divine hope, yet it is but labor in vain. if theſe eyes to ſee, be not alſo accompanied with feet to walk in the Commandments of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It is far better to eſtabliſh the heart with Grace, then reaſon with Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes, becauſe the more quick and apprehenſive a mans underſtanding is, if his heart</hi>

                     <hi>be not ballaſted with godlineſs, its the greater enemy and froward adverſary unto God.</hi> The Apoſtle calls the wiſdom of the fleſh, enmity to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 7. ſuch as is not or cannot be ſubject to the will or truths of God: Thus the wiſe of this world, have the myſteries of Religion hid from them, and they are revealed to babes: A working head, without a working heart and hand in the ways of God, is like a ſword in a mad mans hand. The greateſt oppoſition to Chriſtianity, was from Philoſophers, which made <hi>Tertullian</hi> call Philoſophers the Patriarchs of Heretiques: Therefore the firſt thing the Goſpel doth, is to captivate the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and to bring down every high thing that exalts it ſelf againſt God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. Oh then, thou doeſt not chooſe the better part in Religion, when thy intellectuals are continually exerciſed and whetted, but thy heart and life is barren of all goodneſs: Its true, nothing revealed in Scripture is contrary to right reaſon, though it be much above it; but corrupt and carnal reaſon can no more receive the things of God, then a Dwarf can meaſure the Pyramides: So all the while thou art increaſing knowledge, if Grace be not accompanying, thou art but nouriſhing an enemy againſt God; corrupt underſtandings have prejudiced mens Salvations, as much as looſe and diſſolute lives; therefore ſaith <hi>John Baptist</hi> to the Phariſees, <hi>Think not to ſay in your hearts, &amp;c.</hi> Their reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and diſputes within, kept off the power of Gods word upon them; What brought in all that Angel Worſhip, and deſertion of Chriſt as the head, but that men were puffed up in their filthy mindes? <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 18.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Therefore its better to get Grace in the heart, then Notions in the head,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>becauſe all brain-Knowledge and Diſputes may be perverted to an ill and ungodly end;</hi> onely Grace in the heart cannot be abuſed: Its true, the profeſſion of Grace, and the outward appearance of it may be abuſed to ungodly deſigns: The name and reputation of piety, may be a colour for iniquity; but real piety it ſelf can never be overruled for any ſinful end, becauſe its the nature of Grace to make a man refer all things to God. <hi>Jehu</hi> had but the outward body of Religion, not the ſoul, therefore his intentions were carnal and earthly, while his pretenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were ſpiritual and heavenly: But where true Grace is, there is not divers ſeeds ſowen together, but his inward and outward man are both alike; but it is not thus with Knowledge, Opinions and Diſputes in Religion. This light may be like that of a blazing Star, which is nouriſhed onely by ſlimy and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome exhalations. Several ways, and to ſeveral corrupt ends may all this Diſputing be abuſed; As</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>To gain applauſe and eſteem,</hi> to be admired by ſome followers: Thus the <note place="margin">I. How Diſputes may be abuſed to corrupt ends</note> Phariſees, they did all to be ſeen of men; this the Apoſtle calls <hi>Puffing up in their filthy mindes:</hi> This the Apoſtle expreſſeth, when he ſaith, <hi>Knowledge puff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up, but charity edifieth,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 7. Its a very hard thing if God hath given a
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:30767:176"/>
man golden Talents, not to fall down and worſhip them: If therefore theſe Opinions and Diſputes are fit fewel, to beget pride and vain glory, and to make men look after victory over others, more then the truth; how much better had it been for thee to be exerciſing thy ſelf in godlineſs, and to walk humbly with God! The pride of parts and Opinions, is far greater then that of Cloathes or Beauty, or any other earthly thing, becauſe we judge thoſe excellencies of the minde, above any temporal excellency; therefore conſider with thy ſelf, what is the iſſue of all thy inquiſitions and debates into Religious truths, is it to make thee more ſelf-conceited, more boaſting, and confident in thy ſelf? The igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a ſimple man, will not be ſo great a damnation, as the pride of a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man. Labor then for that which will keep thee low, humble and ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſed, and this Grace onely in the heart will accompliſh: Worms do not ſooner breed in ripe and ſweet fruit, then Pride and Self-confidence doth in knowledge and intellectual abilities.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Another corrupt end of Parts and Diſputes in Religion, is to be ſelf-willed,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">II.</note> 
                     <hi>and ſtiff-necked, not willing to yield to any;</hi> like the Motto upon the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man god <hi>Terminus, Cedo nulli;</hi> and this is that which makes a man an Heretique, when a man after ſeveral admonitions, doth obſtinately and willfully adhere to that opinion which he hath choſen, and will not, as Religion which is from above, would incline, <hi>Be pure, peaceable, and eaſily to be entreated,</hi> James 3. 17. The Phariſees they were frequent in Diſputes with Chriſt, and deſpiſed the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as thoſe that knew not the Law, when they had nothing to ſay, and their mouthes were ſtopped, yet they would adhere to their former way. Its true indeed, conſtancy and ſtedfaſtneſs in the truths of God is neceſſary: <hi>Herein</hi> (ſaith <hi>Luther) we ought to be more Pertinacious then Stoicks;</hi> and it was a Proverbial ſpeech in <hi>Galen,</hi> when men would expreſs a difficulty, <hi>You may ſooner change a Chriſtian from Chriſt,</hi> they were ſuch holdfaſt men: But this doth no ways excuſe erronious pertinacy, or ſelf-willed obſtinacy in falſe ways, or in doubtful diſputations: Its like removing a mountain out of his place, when we would perſwade a man againſt that Tenet or Opinion he is ingaged in.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. <hi>Thoſe Diſputations and Opinions may be carried on, for carnal and temporal advantages, for covetouſneſs and filthy lucre;</hi> as we may ſee it was in the Phariſees: <note place="margin">III.</note> And the Apoſtle diſcovers the ends of the falſe Apoſtles, that they thought gain was godlineſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 6. and the love of money made many ſuffer ſhipwrack in their faith: How then can that be beſt, which may be proſtituted to the worſt and moſt ignoble reſpects? It was <hi>Pauls</hi> comfortable Proteſtation, <hi>That he had not uſed a cloak of Covetouſneſs,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 2. 5. The reaſon why the falſe Apoſtles vented their vain Opinions was, that they might not ſuffer perſecution for the Goſpel of Chriſt. And thus <hi>Auſtin</hi> defined an Heretique, one that took up any falſe way, <hi>Alicujus temporalis commodi gratiâ,</hi> for any temporal advantage and profit. How then can the quinteſſence and ſafety of Religion be laid in that, which may be ſubſervient to ſuch ſinful luſts of the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Its better to get Grace, then to be exerciſed in theſe Diſputes, becauſe many times head-Diſputations are uſed for to make Parties and Schiſms in the Church;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">IV.</note> To draw many Diſciples after them, and ſo to ſtand a divided body from others. The Apoſtle, how careful was he to prevent ſchiſms and diviſions? therefore he daily preſſed love, and to think the ſame thing, and to ſpeak the ſame thing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all things to be done in charity, and nothing through contention and vain glory. It would be a ſad ſtory, to tell you what rents the Leaders of any falſe Opinions have made, which could not be cured in ſome hundreds of years afterwards; and which is the greater wonder, while the Apoſtles were alive, who were infallible Judges, and could have determined any doubt of Religion, yet in their days weeds did come up in Chriſts Garden, and the envious one did ſow tares amongſt the good wheat.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Therefore it is better to exerciſe our ſelves in Grace then in Parts, becauſe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">V.</note>
                     <pb n="319" facs="tcp:30767:176"/>
                     <hi>a man may take a great deal of delight in his Opinions and Notions, and be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinately in love with them, as the Adulterer is with his unlawful object.</hi> The Scripture many times uſeth this expreſſion, <hi>To go a whoring after the imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their own hearts:</hi> When the falſe Phophets and ſeduced people committed any Idolatry, they took a great deal of pleaſure and content in their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and carnal reaſonings, ſo that there may be contemplative fornication, as well as real. Men may fall into inordinate love with the conceits of their own brain, as unclean men with a beautiful face; or as <hi>Pigmalion,</hi> grow inamoured with his own face; ſo that a man may think he preacheth for God, liveth and dyeth for God, when all the while, its but for the apprehenſion of his own minde, which is like a <hi>Dalilah</hi> to him: A fearful thing its thus to be deluded, but its a judgement foretold that ſhall befall thoſe, who receive not the truth in the love of it, <hi>That they ſhall be delivered up to believe a lye,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2. 11. <note place="margin">4.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, A fourth general ground, <hi>Why its better to minde Godlineſs then Diſputes, is becauſe at the day of Judgement, God will proceed according to our works we have done;</hi> not ſo much the knowledge and parts we have had: It will not be, what haſt thou known? chiefly, but how haſt thou lived? Thus the Scripture ſaith, <hi>We muſt be all manifeſted at the tribunal, to give an account for what hath been done in the fleſh,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 11. Oh then, how ſhouldeſt thou ſpend thy time moſt about that, where in the great queſtion wil be at the day of Judgement: God will then make inquiry how fruitful thy life hath been, of Love, Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Temperance, Sobriety, and other good fruits of the Spirit. Would it not be a vain thing in a ſervant, who expects his Maſters coming daily, that will call him to give an account of his Stewardſhip, and he ſhould all the while imploy himſelf in bables, and unneceſſary imployments, not at all tending to that work which his Maſter doth moſt expect, what ſtripes may he juſtly look for? Seeing then the end of thy calling is holineſs, and thou art created to a godly life: Oh look to have this Oyl, beſides the Lamp of knowledge, leſt thou art ſurprized by horrible confuſion, when the Bridegroom comes.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>In Knowledge and Parts there is not a true ſatisfying, and filling of the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>heart with ſpiritual content;</hi> but Grace onely brings Chriſt into the heart, and makes God our portion and inheritance, in having of whom there is onely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. <hi>He that drinks of me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ſhall never thirſt more.</hi> John 4. 14. Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking of Chriſt, is more then to diſpute about him, to make controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in Religion about him: Its by ſaving Grace to be incorporated into him, and to receive Vivifical influence from him. <hi>Solomon</hi> doth not onely diſcover vanity in riches, and temporal advantages, that they give no true content to the ſoul, but alſo in knowledge and learning, that hath a greater vexation with it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he concludes, <hi>Of making Books there is no end:</hi> The ſum or perfection of all is, <hi>Fear God, and keep his Commandments,</hi> Eccleſ. 12. 13. Of Controverſies and Diſputes there is no end, there comes jars and contentions endleſs about them, but the ſum of all is, to get the fear of God in our hearts, and to keep our ſelves unſpotted from the ſins of the world: This hath made even ſome Papiſts who have imployed their whole time in Controverſal Divinity, to cry out of it as an heavy burthen, thinking they have loſt the ſweetneſs of Religion thereby: As <hi>Suarez,</hi> who wrote ſo many Tomes of Diſputes; yet ſaid, He prized that time which was ſet apart for the ſearching and examination of his Conſcience, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation towards God, above all the other time he ſpent. It was a witty alluſion, of <hi>Iſidorus Peluſiota,</hi> As the Iſraelites, who did gather Manna, were to go out of the Camp where war was, for the Manna did not fall within the Camp; ſo thoſe that would gather the Manna and Sweetneſs of Religion, muſt go out of the Camp, where ſpiritual war is, by Religious Diſputes. As in eating of the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Lambs, they took the fleſh, and feaſted on that, but threw away the bones; ſo thou art to take that in Religion, which will feed and nouriſh thy ſoul, but caſt away hard, unprofitable Controverſies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="320" facs="tcp:30767:177"/>
But you will ſay, Is it unlawful to inquire and Diſpute in matters of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Is not this to plead with the Papiſts for ignorance, and to make that the <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> Mother of Devotion? Doth not the Apoſtle bid us <hi>Try all things?</hi> Are we not to ſearch the Scriptures? Are we not forbid to believe every ſpirit, but to try it? 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 1. Muſt we not grow in Knowledge as well as Grate? If the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then make no ſearch, how can he turn Chriſtian? If the Papiſt do not enquire, how can he become Proteſtant? Why are Reformations ſo much magnified, if ſo be we muſt lie down in an old ignorance, or take all things upon truſt? Is not this to make blinde men lead blinde, and ſo both to fall into the ditch?</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore handle this caſe onely, and ſo make application: And firſt, It <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> cannot be denied, but that its a duty not onely upon Miniſters and learned men, but all Chriſtians, men and women, to read and ſearch the Scriptures, and not to take any Doctrine upon the Authority of men, &amp; becauſe the State is of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or becauſe our Anceſtors &amp; Forefathers did ſo, and believed ſo, <hi>Qui deſcrit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

Are not thoſe <hi>Bereans</hi> ſaid to be more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table then others, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 11. becauſe they examined the Apoſtles Doctrine, and looked whether it was conſonant to the Scripture or not, and yet this is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ignorance and ſtupidity of the whole body of Chriſtianity; If they ſhould be required to give an account of their faith, or their Worſhip of God, they could give no better anſwer, then that ignorant woman did to Chriſt, <hi>Our fathers worſhipped here, and art thou better then they</hi>

Our fathers believed thus, and are we wiſer and holier then they: This is not faith, for-faith is a gift of God, wrought by his ſpirit in our bearts, whereby we believe matters of Religion, for a Divine Motive and Authority, even becauſe God hath revealed it in his word; But wo be to us, becauſe of that ſupine and damnable ignorance which is in moſt men: This therefore muſt be granted, that its our duty to grow more in knowledge, and not to reſt as babes in the principles of Religion, as the Apoſtle preſſeth, but to grow and be ſtrong men, and to have our ſences exerciſed to diſcern between good and evil, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. but here is the difficulty, and the great wiſdom required, how to uſe our parts in ſinding out truth, ſo as not to prejudice Grace in our hearts; for the Apoſtle, when he ſaith in the Text, <hi>Its good or better to have the heart eſtabliſed with Grace, then with Doctrines about meats;</hi> he doth not abſolutely forbid the Diſputes about them, for we know this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie was much diſputed about, and even in the Councel at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> after there was much diſpute, there was a determination of it for all Churches: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore take theſe Rules:</p>

                  <p>Briefly therefore to inform you, take notice that Grace hath its leſs principal, and more principal or noble ſignifications; leſſe principal, as when it is uſed for the <hi>external glory, comlineſs, or lovelineſs of a thing.</hi> In which ſenſe it is ſaid, <hi>The grace</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the word Grace.</note> 
                     <hi>of the flower periſheth,</hi> or <hi>for thankfulneſs and gratitude,</hi> 1 Cor. 14. as the Latiniſts ſay, <hi>Habere gratias,</hi> the Alms and Charity alſo of Believers, is ſtiled <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Grace.</hi> But the more noble ſignifications are for <hi>Active</hi> Grace, or <hi>Paſſive</hi> Grace: active Grace, I call that love, and free mercy of God without us, whereby we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and accepted to ſalvation: In this ſenſe Grace is ſaid to juſtifie, and we have remiſſion of ſins by grace, <hi>i. e.</hi> by the favour and love of God onely, not any thing that we have done. This true explication overthroweth the main pillars of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: and in this ſenſe where you read of grace in the New Teſtament it is moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uſed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is <hi>Paſſive</hi> Grace, and that two fold, either for to be accepted of God, to be in Grace and favour with him, as the phraſe is often, to finde grace in a mans eyes. And thus the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is ſaluted, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Greatly favoured and beloved,</hi> not full of inherent Grace, as the popiſh writers groſly pervert this place. Or ſecondly and laſtly, Grace is uſed for thoſe holy qualities infuſed into the ſoul, and that heavenly help God vouchſafeth to us in our way to heaven. Thus faith is a Grace, repentance is a Grace, zeal is a Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Papiſt takes the word Grace in this ſenſe altogether; but we ſay, this is not the moſt noble uſe of
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:30767:178"/>
the word; and the Grace of the Goſpel ſo often magnified, is not any thing within us, but Gods favour and love without us: Yet we deny not, but thoſe holy quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties within us are called grace ſometimes in the Scripture. Indeed there are Divers too rigid, who contend that the word Grace, when it relates towards a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſenſe, is alwaies taken <hi>for the favour of God,</hi> and that it never ſignifieth godlineſſe which is in us, or done by us. But there are ſome places, though not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, wherein is clearly demonſtrated this uſe of the word as it beto kens ſomthing inhering, and abiding in us, as 2 <hi>Pet. 2. ult. Grow in grace, and the knowledge of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</hi> To grow in grace muſts needs be underſtood of thoſe holy gifts of Gods Spirit in us, which are daily to be improved: ſo <hi>Sing with grace in your hearts, Col.</hi> 3. 16. And again, <hi>Let your speech administer grace to the hearers, Col.</hi> 4. 6. And if it be acknowledged by all, that the common gifts of Gods Spirit, ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying, working of miracles, yea, and offices in the Church, are called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, why ſhould it be thought hard thoſe ſanctifying gifts may be alſo named Graces? And in this ſenſe Grace is taken in this Text: for that holy work of God upon the heart, whereby he doth eſtabliſh and confirm it in godly wayes. From this ſenſe we obſerve,
<q>
                        <l>That there is a work of God upon a mans heart, which is called Grace. <note place="margin">Obſ.</note>
                        </l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This point is of admirable uſe; For without grace here, there can be no glory hereafter. And this grace of God is rarely to be found: there go many counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits for this precious jewel: we are apt to call any moral virtue, any ingenuous and civil converſation, with the excellent Title of Grace. It is therefore a ſubject worth the treating on, to ſhew what are the effects and ſymptomes of this Grace upon a man; for nothing in the whole world is ſo deſirable as Grace: no created excellency comes near to grace. A rich man without grace, is like a dead carkaſſe with glorious garments upon it. A learned man without grace, is alſo like a dead corps with ſweet flowers ſtrewed over it. It is the abſence, or preſence of Grace that makes a man happy or miſerable: Oh therefore that before this ſubject be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it might turn you all into the likeneſſe thereof; That as fire turneth every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it worketh upon into its own nature, ſo grace might make every hearer graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. That the word might be the ſeal, and your hearts the wax to receive that Divine impreſſion: That ſo ye may be as <hi>Paul ſaith, An Epiſtle to be ſeen and read of all men;</hi> that all men may behold and admire the grace of your lives, which is wrought by the word of Grace. To imprint this upon you. I ſhall diſcover firſt the proper Grounds and Reaſons why it is called Grace, with the noble effects thereof.</p>
                  <p>Onely in the firſt place I muſt neceſſarily remove a falſe ground, or effect attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to it, and that by all Papiſt Writers, who ſay, <hi>Therefore this inward holineſſe in us is called Grace, becauſe it makes us perfectly accepted, and gracious with God. ſo that thereby we have a right to eternal happineſſe.</hi> Hereupon they ſpeak moſt of Grace as that which doth <hi>Gratum facere, Make a man accepted unto God</hi> from the inward condignity and worth of it. This is to take away the true child, and to put a dead one in the room: to take away Goſpel grace, evangelical grace, and to put ſomething done by us in the room of it. For although it be true, that the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly actions we do are above humane ſtrength, and we are enabled thereunto by the power of God onely; and are therefore called <hi>Grace;</hi> Yet they are not done ſo perfectly and purely, as thereby to make us accepted with God. This is good to know, that ſo we might give all glory to Chriſt, and be debaſed in our ſelves. It is a great piece of wiſdome in Chriſtianity not to confound grace juſtifying, and grace ſanctifying: Grace juſtifying is an action of God, grace ſanctifying is a quality wrought in us: Grace juſtifying is perfect, grace ſanctifying hath much imperfection cleaving to it. Now that no grace in any godly man doth make accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to eternal life, appeareth</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>From the reliques of corruption in every man, though regenerated, as we ſee</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1 Why grace within us can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not juſtifie us.</note> 
                     <hi>in</hi> Paul, <hi>whereby he dare not truſt in himſelf, but in Chriſt onely.</hi> He findes evil when
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:30767:179"/>
he would do good; for which reaſon the beſt Saints have begged earneſtly for pardon, and have been afraid with <hi>David,</hi> leſt God <hi>ſhould enter into judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with them, and ſo they not be juſtified,</hi> Pſal, 143. 2. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> when he mentioned thoſe high acts of grace which he did, yet prayeth often, <hi>Remember me O Lord, and spare me,</hi> Neh. 13.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Grace within us cannot juſtifie us, becauſe the Scripture layeth that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>wholly on God and Christ.</hi> God the Fathers grace, as the efficient cauſe of it; and God the Sons merits, as the ground of it; and by faith we are to put it on as a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſo that we are ſtill in a paſſive ſenſe ſaid to be juſtifyed, and not in an active to juſtifie our ſelves, unleſſe in that ill ſenſe as the Phariſee is ſaid to juſtifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. None doth ſo Divinely, and admirably prove this point by ſeveral arguments, as <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles doth, inſomuch that one would wonder how any Popiſh writer can make Commentaries upon his Epiſtles, and not be convinced of their errour. So that our happineſſe, and the ground of all our peace, lyeth not in what we have done, but what we have received, and in what Chriſt hath done for us. This doctrine is like the hony <hi>Sampſon</hi> found in the dead Lyon, in Chriſt crucified, which we are to inſtruct all burthened ſinners in. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> comes off at laſt with his <hi>Tutiſſimum eſt,</hi> It is moſt ſafe to reſt wholly upon Chriſt, not our righteouſneſſe. I know it is hard to call godlyneſſe grace, and not to think that it muſt be all in all; and how prone we are to leave the fountain, Chriſt, and to run to the Ciſterns, our own graces, every mans heart can eaſily ſuggeſt. This ſtumbling-ſtone being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the way.</p>
                  <p>Let us in the next place take a view of the true reaſons why it is called Grace, as alſo the properties of it.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, <hi>It is called grace, becauſe it comes freely from the grace of God.</hi> The <note place="margin">1. Why inward holineſs is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Grace.</note> effect is dignified with the Title of the cauſe; it is called grace, becauſe it comes of grace. It is true, all good things come from God: <hi>Every good and perfect gift is from him, the Father of lights;</hi> as all light is from the ſun mediately, or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately: yet we do not call the good things of nature, Grace, as <hi>Pelagius</hi> did, becauſe they come from God in a general way, as the Author of nature, this in a more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and appropriated way, as the Author of Grace: So that if thou haſt grace in thy heart and life, the very name of grace ſhould make thee humble, thankful, lowly in thy own eyes. If it be grace, then it is not by thy natural ſtrength and power: If it be Gods gift, it is not thy ability. Oh then admire the goodneſſe of God: If thou haſt an heart to love God, to believe in a promiſe, to minde hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, ſay, <hi>This is grace.</hi> It is not nature, nature hath no power to do thus, nor no will to do thus: No power, for godly actions are wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the ſphere of humane power; humane power and humane actions are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate, but a humane ſtrength, and Divine actions have no congruity. And as nature hath no power, ſo alſo no will, or inclination to it, but rather delights in the clean contrary.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Godlineſs in the heart and life is called grace, not onely becauſe it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed freely by God upon us, but becauſe we were unworthy, and deſerved the clean</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>contrary.</hi> It is the judgement of <hi>Pareus</hi> a learned Divine, that the image of God ſtampt on <hi>Adam,</hi> though it was the ſyſteme of all Godlineſſe, yet it could not be called grace; and therefore reproveth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> for ſtiling his book, <hi>De gratiâ primi hominis,</hi> Of the grace of the firſt man. It was indeed godlineſſe, and holineſſe (ſaith he) but it was not grace; becauſe though it was freely beſtowed on <hi>Adam,</hi> yet he being not in a ſinful condition, but that original righteouſneſſe was a perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction due to him (as the Orthodox in a ſound ſenſe maintain againſt the Papiſts,) therefore it could not be called grace. I will not determine this; but to be ſure, now ſince man hath fallen, that work of God ſanctifying our natures, healing our corruptions, is grace, becauſe it is vouchſafed unto us, lying in a clean contrary, and oppoſite condition. Thus not onely grace juſtifying and evangelical was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable to <hi>Paul,</hi> when he had been the chiefeſt of many ſinners, but grace ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:30767:179"/>
alſo. That God ſhould make ſuch a blackmore white, ſuch a noyſome weed a pleaſant flower, How great was that regenerating grace which made ſuch a change? Lye down then in ſpiritual ſhame and confuſion, Oh thou godly ſoul, and ſay, <hi>Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto thy grace let all glory be given:</hi> For what was there in thy former life time, that ſhould merit at Gods hand to make ſuch a change? Waſt thou not ignorant as others, it may be, prophane as others, ſeeking for happineſſe in the bowels of the Creatures as others? How often doth <hi>Paul</hi> minde converted perſons, with their former vain converſations, that ſo the remarkable change made by grace upon their ſouls might be the more wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>This work of godlineſſe is called grace, becauſe it is arbitrarily beſtowed by God upon whom he pleaſeth, and when he pleaſeth:</hi> Whom he will he calleth. <hi>Paul</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> is raviſhed with the unſearchable depths of Gods wiſedom in diſpenſing his grace, eſpecially God uſeth not to give his grace, where there might any outward excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency ſeem to deſerve it, for that grace might appear out of meaſure gracious: He ſelects thoſe objects, that have the leaſt ſhew, and that are moſt contemptible in the eyes of men. Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>He hath not called many noble, many wiſe, many learned;</hi> For if he had taken that method, men would have thought God had been affected with ſuch humane excellencies, and therefore received the rich rather then poor, the learned rather then ignorant; this alſo is an overwhelming conſideration of Gods love. Who art thou that God hath given grace to thee, and not to many thouſand others? It may be God hath choſen thee, one out of all the family, all thy kindred, yea all the town where thou liveſt. Did God lay An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels aſide, one whereof was able to do more ſervice to God, then millions of men, and take thee? Oh grace! Again, hath God laid many noble men, many great men aſide, and given grace to thee a poor mean man? Oh unſearchable riches of grace! Further, hath God laid many men aſide, who by their Sexe could have been more active and vigorous for God, and beſtowed grace on thee a poor weak wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man? Oh admirable grace! The Phariſee thanked God that he was not like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men; but he did it from a principle of preſumption and arrogance: But thou mayeſt with humble thankfulneſſe, and great fear and trembling, acknowledge the mercy of God, that he hath not left thee in thy filthy luſts, as he hath done other men. Chriſt aggravated Gods providence and care to the widow of <hi>Sarepta,</hi> that there were many widows in that place beſides her, yet the Prophet was ſent to her only. But here is a greater aggravation, how many men and widows are there in the place where thou liveſt, yet grace is vouchſafed to thee rather then others? This ſhould put fire in thy bones and bowels, it ſhould make thee active for God; for thou ſhould eſt think if God had called others, given grace to others, they would have been buſie and fervent men; they would have been zealous for his glory. Oh let me not requite the goodneſſe of God after ſo ill a manner: by giving grace to me, and denying it to another of more learning, parts, boldneſſe, and courage, he ſeemeth to loſe by it; others would have improved his Talents better then I have done: Certainly this conſideration ſhould be a goad in thy ſide, thou ſhouldſt ſay, Lord, it is fit that I ſhould do thee all that ſervice which others would have done, if converted, in my room. It is not fit thou ſhouldſt be a loſer by me.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>It is called Grace, becauſe it enableth a man to do thoſe things which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>all humane power.</hi> In this ſenſe grace and nature are alwaies immediately oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite; for as thoſe common gifts of Gods ſpirit, working of miracles, ſpeaking with tongues, and propheſying, are called grace, becauſe not procured by humane indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, but vouchſafed by Gods benevolence; ſo much more the enabling of us weak and impotent ſinners, to do that which is holy and heavenly, may much rather be called grace. This point, if rightly conſidered, would make men look upon grace as a more rare and admirable thing then men generally account it to be. Alas, thou liveſt as thou haſt been trained up; thou walkeſt according to thy education, thou comeſt to holy Duties as the cuſtome and manner is, but never thinkeſt until a
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:30767:180"/>
man be prepared by grace from above, he can no more do any thing holily then a poyſonous ſerpent can vent hony. Grace therefore is that, which if once infuſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a man, ſo far as that is operative, makes him live not as a man, much leſſe as a beaſt, but upon Divine and heavenly principles; hence it is that the godly are ſaid to be <hi>partakers of the divine nature,</hi> and Chriſt is ſaid <hi>to live in them,</hi> Epheſ. 3. Oh the heavenly Metamorphoſis and change which is wrought on a man by grace: For how is it poſſible that a man ſhould love the glory of God, more then his own comforts, wealth, or life it ſelfe, if a Divine power did not enable him? How could it be that a man ſhould finde more joy in God, <hi>then they have had when their wine and oyle encreaſeth,</hi> did not grace work thus mightily? All civility, morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ingenuity, and humane piety, or devotion, is but a ridiculous Ape to true grace.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>It is called grace, becauſe it is the moſt choice and excellent perfection of a man in relation to his ultimate end, which is the enjoyment of God.</hi> The glory, beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <note place="margin">5.</note> and excellency of any thing, is called the grace of it: and we in Engliſh ſay, <hi>ſuch a thing is the grace of a man:</hi> Now nothing may be ſo well ſaid the grace of a man, as grace or godlineſſe. It is not wealth, honour, greatneſſe ſets out a man, ſo much as grace: there is ſcarce any perfection of ſenſe, but the bruit beaſts do in ſome ſenſe or other exceed a man; and as for intellectual abilities, the Divels do far tranſcend man; onely grace puts a man in an higher degree then theſe can attain unto: onely there is required a ſpiritual eye and judgement, to judge grace the moſt excellent thing. Certainly if ſolid reaſon might take place, thou wouldſt quickly be convinced that grace is the choyceſt perfection by this Argument; That is the choyſeſt qualification which diſpoſeth a man to his choyeeſt end: now wealth, health, and ſuch ſenſible mercies, they onely prepare for a ſenſible, and animal good: Parts, learning, and political wiſedom, they onely fit for a civil good; but grace and godlyneſſe, they diſpoſe for a ſpiritual good, though not perfectly, much leſſe meritoriouſly. If therefore every thing be prized for its inſtrumental uſe and ſervice, Why are not all things neglected to obtain grace? And howſoever with Heathens and Pagans this Doctrine may not be acknowledged, yet with you Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians who receive the word of God, and profeſſe a ſubjection to it, How can it be denied? Oh then think not thy ſelf better for any outward temporal mercy, but by his grace. Let that be thy firſt queſtion, Am I godly? You do not judge of an horſe by his outward trappings, and goodly ornaments ſaid the Heathen: ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may we eſteem of a man by the many outward mercies he enjoyeth, but the work of God upon his ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Grace in the heart, is nothing but glory begun.</hi> Grace is glory begun <note place="margin">6.</note> here, as glory is grace perfected hereafter, and this doth wonderfully extol the work of grace. Indeed here it is imperfect, and accompanied with many defects; there are worms in the beſt fruit, and ſo an unlovelineſſe in us, as well as a comeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and therefore though it be preſent in the hearts of Gods people, yet they dare not appeal unto Gods juſtice, nor can they endure his tribunal. Now we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in part, love in part, and we may ſay of all our graces, as the Heathen of his knowledge, <hi>His knowledge was not ſo much knowledge, as ignorance;</hi> ſo neither are our graces ſo much graces as infirmities: but yet in time this imperfection will be aboliſhed, God will make thy love a glorious love, thy godlineſſe glorious, when he ſhall add his ultimate perfection to it. Grace here is like a childe in its infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and we ſpeak and know as children, but in Heaven we become like men.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The nature of grace inherent in us, lyeth in an irreconcileable oppoſition with ſin; they are contrary one to another, as light and darkneſs, bitter and <note place="margin">7.</note> ſweet.</p>
                  <p>A three-fold contrariety we may acknowledge in them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>An effective oppoſition, as between fire and water.</hi> Thus the ſpirit luſteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fleſh; as the ſpirit of wine and poyſon conflict together. Therefore <note place="margin">I.</note>
                     <pb n="327" facs="tcp:30767:180"/>
when ſin is at quiet in a mans life, and thou art ungodly, prophane, and there is no reluctancy, no oppoſition; this is an argument of little or no grace in thee. Oh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider this all ye who lye down in ſin with ſecurity; there is no complaining in thy heart, no trouble in thy conſcience, no ſtruglings in thy breaſt, no ſtirrings in fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayer, <hi>Lord help me elſe I am overcom.</hi> Truely as the pſalmiſt ſaith of ſome wicked mens death, <hi>They have no bonds, they are not in pain as other men,</hi> ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in their life time they are not in that ſhame, grief, and trouble about ſin, as the godly ſometimes are.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>There is a formal oppoſition.</hi> They are two immediate forms, (as it were) in <note place="margin">II.</note> the ſoul as health and ſickneſſe, white and black: and howſoever it is a rule, that two contraries cannot be in the ſame ſubject, yet that is to be underſtood in the intenſe degree, otherwiſe as there is a <hi>crepuſculum,</hi> when its partly night, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly day, ſo there is ſuch a temperament in every godly man, a twilight; ſome ſin and ſome godlineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>There is a moral oppoſition.</hi> Where ſin doth abound, there it procureth <note place="margin">III.</note> at Gods hand either the denial, or withdrawing of ſome meaſure of grace already beſtowed; and thus where grace is improved, there God hath made a promiſe to ſubdue ſin, to overcome thoſe rebellious Jebuſites that yet lurk in our land: ſo that if grace be in a man, it lieth not idle: This will quickly be diſcovering it ſelf, by crucifying and mortifying of ſin. Therefore the next thing to be done, is to ſhew the characters of a gracious man: in the mean while make this uſe: <hi>If grace be of this nature, then it plainly diſcovers thoſe to be graceleſſe men that live in the wilfull committing of groſſe ſins, without repentance or reformation.</hi> Oh thou of no grace, How is it that thou art not affraid, and aſhamed of thy ſelf? If grace were in thy heart, would it not be in thy tongue, in thy life, in thy converſation? If grace be the chiefeſt excellency of a man, ſets a man above all other creatures; then ſin which is the immediate contrary, muſt needs be the greateſt debaſement of a man: all wickedneſſe is a ſhame, a reproach; it makes a man like a beaſt, like a divel. Oh then let all ſinners tremble, and be confounded at their woful eſtate; when God comes in glory to judge thee for thy life, What grace ſhall he finde in thee? Thou haſt deſired wealth, but not grace; thou haſt deſired to be great, but not gracious.</p>
                  <p>Uſe 2. <hi>How vain a thing it is to hope for the grace of God, and his favour without us, if we have not grace within us.</hi> You heard godlineſſe is called grace, becauſe it comes from Gods grace; it comes from his love: ſo that when he loveth graciouſly, he maketh gracious: ſin ſhall not have dominion over you, becauſe you are under grace. In vain therefore do men hope for grace juſtifying, where they do not finde it ſanctifying: In vain do they preſume that Gods grace will pardon their ſinnes, when it doth not deliver them from the power and dominion of it. Oh then, that men would not wilfully deſtroy their own ſouls by damnable preſumption. Thou hopeſt in Gods grace who art an inordinate liver, a prophane ſwearer, and riotous perſon: No, ſhew me the grace that ſanctifyeth thee, and then I dare promiſe thee (the grace that will juſtifie thee.</p>

                  <p>THere is a choice and noble work of God called <hi>Grace,</hi> as you have heard: The next thing to be inſiſted upon, is, <hi>What are the Characters and Properties of a man who hath grace.</hi> For as all cauſes doe manifeſt themſelves by ſome effects, ſo grace in the hearts and lives of men will diſcover it ſelf quickly by its o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations. Think it not therefore too much, if we come twice or thrice in words of inſtruction, and exhortation, about this ſubject of grace: for as its not one ſhowr of Rain that is enough to ſatisfie the parched earth after a great drought, but there muſt be continuall droppings; ſo neither is one Sermon ſufficient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and reform you in this matter, but there muſt be a frequent and vigorous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of this truth to your hearts.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Character of grace in a man, is, <hi>To elevate and lift up his heart, ſo that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of grace in a man. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>in all his Actions, Religious, Civill or Naturall, he relates to God as his chief and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end.</hi> For grace being of a ſuperior, and more exalted nature than humane ſtrength and abilities, it doth thereby lift up a man to an higher end than otherwiſe he would aime at. <hi>Whatſoever ye doe, whether eat or drink</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>doe all to the glory of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 31. As the ſuperior Orb carryeth all the inferior Orbs away in its own motion, contrary to their particular inclinations; ſo grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into the heart overcometh all thoſe ſinful and ſelfiſh inclinations which are in us, and makes us more through God, to God. Grace in a man is like fire, which being of an active nature, doth change and aſſimilate every thing, turning it into fire, or very like it: Therefore even hard and cold Iron put into the fire looks like fire, and ſeemeth to be made fire: Thus godlineſſe in the heart of a man, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth every thing towards God; Whereas before his Converſion God was not in his thoughts, his intentions, his deſires and affections, but he lived wholly of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and to himſelf: Now his eyes, his aimes, his reſolutions are fixed principally upon God and his glory. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifieth about the work of his Miniſtery, the diſcharge whereof might be ſubject to many corrupt and carnall intentions, that he performed it in godly ſimplicity, as of God, and to God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 17. Hence are thoſe expreſſions, to acquaint our ſelves with God, in all our ways to aknowledge him: and a godly life is deſcribed to be a walking with God; ſo that as the herb <hi>Heliotropium</hi> doth turn about and open it ſelf according to the motion of the Sun; thus where Gods commands are, Gods will is manifeſted, or his glory intereſted, there a godly man doth apply himſelf. Oh what a precious temper is this in all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious actions, not to be carryed by vain-glory, and applauſe of men, but to eye God ſolely! Well did the Father call vain-glory, <hi>The ſweet ſpoiler of ſpiritual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:30767:181"/>
and a pleaſant thief,</hi> for ſo indeed it is. The Phariſees were not godly, though in prayers and almes often, becauſe theſe things were not done to God, but for humane applauſe: This is the Pirate, that many times robbeth us of our rich Merchandiſe, our ſpirituall traffique with God: Inſomuch that a man may be ſerving himſelf and his corrupt ends, when to the world he ſeemeth to be ſerving of God. As in religious actions, ſo even in humane and civill actions, the glory of God is the aime propounded; what the Apoſtle would have ſervants doe, not to eye their Maſter, but to doe it as unto Chriſt; the ſame is required of us in all our civill imployments: Art thou a Magiſtrate? Are thy imployments in civill conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations? conſider not men, regard not merit; but as he which ſhoots that he may hit the mark, takes a little time to unite his force, and fix his aime; ſo doe thou gather thy affections together, and ſet thy ſelf on purpoſe to remember, that this is for God, and to God. Thou deſireſt to look further than humane Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments would ſuggeſt; this one Scripture diſcovers few men have grace: for take them in religious Duties, there Cuſtome, Education, or Pride, are the principles that ſet them on work, or in their civill imployments, and then ſelf-advantage, earthly greatneſſe, temporall preferments are the Fountain to theſe ſtreams; But a gracious man is filled with a divine Spirit, over-looking thoſe inferiour reſpects, his end being ſpirituall, and ſo raiſed above all earthly temptations; this being the proper work of grace, to put a man into ſuch a diſpoſition, as that he may have communion with, and enjoyment of God; for as a Beaſt is no wayes fit for any commerce with a man, till he be made a man; ſo a man while without grace, hath no diſpoſition, or qualification in him whereby he may draw nigh to God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>A gracious man hath an high eſteem and prize of the things of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>grace.</hi> The Goſpel is the Goſpel of grace, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 24. The Word is the Word of grace, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 3. God is the God of grace, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 11. The Ordinances are means of Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 24. Juſtification and Salvation are the effects of Grace, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. 5. Now a man of grace doth mightily deſire theſe things of grace; and it is an evident argument of one without grace, when he hath no dear eſteem, no precious delight in theſe ſpiritual things. When <hi>David</hi> makes ſo many ſweet ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing expreſſions about God being his Portion, his inheritance, all in heaven and earth to him; when he doth ſo admire the Ordinances, and the worſhip of God. What are theſe but the honey of a ſweet Bee, the manifeſtations of a gracious ſpirit? So thoſe divine ſtrains of <hi>Paul, Epheſ. 1. &amp; alibi,</hi> admiring the grace of God in ſpirituall mercies, do tell all, what a gracious heart <hi>Paul</hi> hath within, that can adore ſuch priviledges. Whereas now come to an unregenerate man, he can no more eſteem theſe things than the Swine doth Pearl, or ſweet Flowers. The man in the Parable when he had found this Pearl, he ſold all he had to be owner of it: And thus it is with a godly man, when once he hath taſted of the power of grace, he loves his luſts no more, his ſins no more: As when a man hath taſted Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, all other things ſeem unſavoury; thus after he is godly, all his former wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and worldly wayes ſeem like Garlick and Onions to this heavenly Manna; how devoid then of all grace doe men generally demonſtrate themſelves? where is their high eſteem of God and Ordinances, of all ſpirituall priviledges? Alas, Preach of theſe things, and they ſay, Who will ſhew us ſome other good thing? Thus to the diſtemperate palate of a ſinfull man, the ſweeteſt objects give no reliſh at all.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Its a ſure Character of grace to make a man hunger and thirſt ſtill af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more degrees of grace.</hi> Therefore the godly man is deſcribed by ſeeking, <hi>Rom.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 2. 3. by deſiring, <hi>Neh.</hi> 1. 11. by hungring and thirſting, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. 6. becauſe his ſoul is never ſatisfied in the way of grace, but he hath an holy dropſie on him, the more he drinks of this water the more he thirſteth after it: Objects that are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſenſe, they glut the Faculty at laſt; ſo that an honey-comb is ſometimes loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed; but ſpiritual objects are ſo farre from burthening the heart, and cauſing a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:30767:182"/>
that the more they are enjoyed, the more they are deſired, and longed after. Every Chriſtian is compared to a Merchant, whoſe ſcope is to increaſe and advance his eſtate; to a Travailer, who conſiders not ſo much how many miles he hath gone, as how much of his journey is ſtill behind. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> he forgets that which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. and preſſeth forward to the mark before him; ſo that it is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſign of a man in grace, when he goeth on to perfection, and thinketh not, I will live as the moſt doe, I will not be ſingular, or goe further than the multitude doth: Its a ſign thou haſt not taſted how good grace and holineſſe is, and therefore thou deſireſt not more of it; and certainly, if grace to ſuch a degree be ſo good and comfortable, how much more is it to an higher degree! As the dog is ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh until he hath got the ſent of his game, and then he purſueth it violently; ſo it is here: A man that hath not apprehended the powerfull excellency, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of grace, he is very remiſſe and negligent in all endeavours after it; but he that hath once felt this fire in his boſome, deſireth to make it ſeven times hotter. Oh then, if a drop of this grace bee ſo precious, what is an Ocean of it?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Grace doth especially, and in the firſt place cleanſe away the filthineſs of the Spirit, and Heart pollution.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle putteth theſe two together, <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>Perfecting holineſſe, and cleanſing our ſelves from all filthineſſe of the ſpirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 1. For grace (you heard) was the immediate contrary and oppoſite to ſinne, ſeeing therefore the main ſtrength of ſinne lyeth in the heart, and a man is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his actions, but his heart; ſo the chief power of grace is in the heart; So that as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Sing with grace in your heart:</hi> Thus pray and hear with grace in your hearts. The Phariſees that were ſo admirable for externall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, or Superſtition, rather wholly neglected the work of grace in their hearts; and therefore contrary to nature, when their Streams ſeemed clear, the Fountain was all muddy. When the fruit looked like ſweet fruit, the root was altogether bitter. The heart of a man is the Fountain, from whence iſſueth either <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e, or death; Its the ſouls Privy-Chamber, and the proper Throne for Chriſt to ſit upon. How uncomely were it in an houſe, to have all the out-rooms and entrance ly<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and ready ſwept, but the inmoſt places altogether foul and ruinous: no leſſe folly is it, to look to thy externall converſation, that it be clean and unblameable before men, but the inward frame of thy heart to be like a noiſome Sepulcher. He therefore that is gracious is afraid of ſinne in his heart; <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me,</hi> Pſal. 66. 18. Though all the world cannot judge him for outward impieties, yet becauſe God ſeeth the unbelief, pride and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſave urineſſe of his heart, this doth exceedingly afflict him. But oh what ſtrangers are men to their own hearts! who take the Pſalmiſts Counſell, to commune with their hearts, and be ſtill? who embraceth that duty ſo often commanded, <hi>To ſearch and try the heart?</hi> Never call that grace in thy life, which is not firſt rooted in thy heart. Oh ſay then, O Lord, all the work lyeth within, help againſt inward luſts, againſt inward diſtempers.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Grace doth there eſpecially inable a man to doe thoſe duties, where fleſh and bloud would ſooneſt contradict.</hi> When we are commanded to deny our ſelves, and <note place="margin">5.</note> take up the Croſſe to follow him, when commanded to cut off our right hand, and to pull out our right eye; theſe things are paradoxall to fleſh and bloud; they cry out, Theſe are hard ſpeeches, who can bear them? But grace, that is ſeen eſpecially in curing and healing ſuch weakneſſes; for where Nature is ſtopt, and can go no further, there grace doth properly diſcover it ſelf; Where nature ſuggeſts this to be done as ſafe and good: Grace adviſeth, But this is a ſinne, this is againſt Gods glory. When <hi>Joſeph</hi> was in that inticing temptation, had he attended to the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the fleſh, he had been over-whelmed: but grace ſuggeſting the fear of God, and his preſence, and how great a ſinne it would be againſt him, that preſerved him as admirably as the three Worthies in the fiery Furnace, who were not ſo much as ſcorched. We may ſee an excellent inſtance of nature and grace in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> obedience, and his faith; his obedience, when God commanded him to take
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:30767:182"/>
his onely Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and offer him a Sacrifice: Every word was enough to make Nature reſiſt and gain-ſay; His Son, onely Son, <hi>Iſaac,</hi> whom thou loveſt, to offer a Sacrifice. Oh what violence is here to nature! but ſee how potent grace is, which no doubt checked all the reaſonings of nature, as <hi>Job</hi> did his wife for ſpeaking foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly. Again, in matter of faith in the promiſe of God, there its ſaid, <hi>He conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not the deadwomb of Sarah,</hi> Rom. 4. nor his own body, <hi>as good as dead,</hi> but reſted on the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and therefore had hope againſt hope, hope in the Promiſe, againſt hope in Nature. Thus when as nature hath its fear, grace hath its fear above that; where nature hath its hope, grace hath hope above it: and how prevalent grace is above nature, is apparent in that neceſſary qualification in every Diſciple; <hi>He that loveth not Father or Mother more than me, cannot be my Diſciple;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon when one deſired to bury his Father, before he followed Chriſt; which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a requeſt of Civility, and naturall affection; ſhould he ſuffer his Father to ſtink, and rot above ground? is it not againſt nature to leave him unburied? yet our Saviour rejecteth him with this, <hi>Let the dead bury the dead,</hi> Matth. 8. 22. So then where grace is in a man, there it conquers naturall inclinations, affections and deſires; inſomuch that he puts off a man, when he puts on a Chriſtian. Oh then doe not think, that when once made gracious, ſuch humane naturall Obligations will be ſuch ſnares to thee, as they have been: It will not be graces excuſe to ſay, I have bought a Farm, or married a wife, and ſo cannot come; but therefore the rather come.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, <hi>Where grace is, there it doth not despiſe little ſinnes, but is afraid to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> Its farre from ſaying, as he of <hi>Zoar, Is it not a little one?</hi> He dares not ſwear petty Oathes, nor uſe idle words; for to grace no ſinne is little, becauſe its againſt that great God of heaven, who hath ſeverely puniſhed even little ſinnes. <hi>Adams</hi> firſt ſinne, which hath involved all the world in ſo much miſery, and made the firſt ſpark to kindle hell, was but little for the matter of it. <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſinne, for which God kept him out of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſeemed very little comparatively: and <hi>Elies</hi> ſinne, was onely in the defect of grace, he did his duty, but not with ſuch Zeal as he ſhould have done; yet for this Gods judgements were ſo great upon him, and his Family, that it made the eares of thoſe tingle who heard it. And as for <hi>Saul,</hi> he committed many grievous ſinnes, but that for which God took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to deprive him of his Kingdome, and to caſt him off, was but the not ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long enough till <hi>Samuel</hi> came; and therefore ſetting upon the Sacrifice to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the people who were impatient. Therefore where grace is, there cannot but be preciſeneſſe, exactneſſe, they cannot ſwallow a Gnat, much leſſe a Camell: It makes the heart tender, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>like the eye, which the leaſt crum of duſt doth greatly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend: As for that Phariſaical hypocriſie, to make conſcience about leſſe things, and to neglect great, grace doth alſo abhor; for if a little ſinne not regarded, or ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by worldly men, be ſo grievous to it, how much rather that which is of a more bloudy nature? and if ſinne cannot compell him to goe on a mile, how ſhall it doe two or three? Therefore both ſinne and nature are rectified by grace.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>A gracious man is full of humility, lowlineſſe of minde, and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> Where there is <hi>gratia,</hi> there is <hi>gratitudo;</hi> hence you heard the ſame word ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth <note place="margin">7.</note> both, God reſiſteth the proud, but he giveth grace to the humble, <hi>James</hi> 4. 6. ſo that lowlineſſe of ſpirit is both an evidence of grace, and a means to preſerve and encreaſe grace. The very name grace puts them in mind of their unworthineſs, that they did nothing to cauſe God to doe it for them rather than others; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as no Doctrines are more contrary to the work of grace in a mans heart, than thoſe of <hi>Pelagians</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> who make the efficacy of grace ſuſpended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the co-operation of our will. Oh! how can they diſpute againſt, or write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that grace of God which they have ſound ſo omnipotent upon themſelves, making them of unwilling willing, and of enemies friends to him? If therefore thou art a man of pride, ſcorn and vain-glory, know theſe are ſurer demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:30767:183"/>
of the Devill reigning in thee, than Chriſt by grace. Obſerve <hi>Paul,</hi> a man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced with much grace, and who ſo magnifying grace as he? All the ſtreams of his ſanctifying grace run back again, and empty themſelves into juſtifying grace, the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean and Fountain whence they flow.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, <hi>Grace, where it is, makes a man diligent, fervent and conſcientious in all the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">8.</note> 
                     <hi>means of grace.</hi> God knoweth that grace in our hearts is like ſmoaking flax quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put out; he therefore hath appointed ſeverall Ordinances to quicken and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame us thereunto, ſuch as prayer, hearing of the Word, and Sabbaths: now a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart makes much of theſe, they are food and nouriſhment of the ſoul; how doth <hi>David</hi> long for them? Therefore men that live without the publick Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or private and family duties, what argument can they have to conclude for grace in their hearts? for if that were in them and abounded, oh the zeal in all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly duties that would diſcover it ſelf, knowing that the heart would grow cold, if theſe coales of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>In the next place, conſider the excellent, and precious advantages or properties of grace. As, <note place="margin">The precious advantages or properties of grace. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>It is the onely true nobility and perfection of the ſoul.</hi> If the Poet ſaid of Morall virtue, that it was <hi>ſola &amp; unica nobilitas animi,</hi> the ſole nobility of the mind: how much more muſt grace be? for this is <hi>indoles divina non humana.</hi> We are by it born of God, and ſo reſemble not man but God. The <hi>Bereans</hi> for ſearching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to matters of Religion are ſaid to be more noble than others: for as ſinne makes a man baſe, unworthy, and therefore like unto the bruit beaſts, ſo grace innobles a man, exalteth him, and makes him like an Angel, yea like God. The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour, ſaith <hi>Solomon, Pro.</hi> 12. 26. wherfore the godly are compared to veſſels of honor in the houſe, &amp; the wicked to veſſels of diſhonor, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 20. Oh then why do men eſteem themſelves according to their birth, greatneſſe, worldly advantages: Alas, its grace that is the glory of a man: wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe in great men, honoured men, rich men, is but a noiſome dunghill covered with Scarlet.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Grace onely hath the promiſes of this life, and the life to come made to it.</hi> So ſaith the the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 8. Heaven and Salvation is promiſed not to <note place="margin">2.</note> men of parts, morality; but to men of grace. Look over any promiſe in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for pardon of ſinne, for joy and happineſſe, this is given onely to thoſe that have grace in them. Now to be a man without a promiſe, is to be like one in the old world, without an Ark, when the Deluge did over-flow: Let thy ſinnes lye like ſo many mountains upon thee, thou haſt no incouragement to call God Father, till this grace hath made thee a child to him. Why is it, that men doe not conſider this now? Who can tell thee all the woe and miſery that belongs to thee, while God ſets a fiery ſword to keep thee from every promiſe, as once he did <hi>Adam</hi> from the Tree of life? and for the things of this life, they are promiſed onely to grace by way of mercy. Wicked men they have temporall, worldly mercies, but it is by Gods Providence, not by his promiſe; and therefore they are not mercies to them, but inſtruments to draw out and exerciſe their impieties the more: wicked men, if they have health and ſtrength, they are more imboldened in their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; if they have riches and large revenues, their luſts are thereby more active; ſo that to the gracious man onely they become a mercy; ſo what can more induce thee to get grace than this, To conſider that hereby every thing will be a mercy to thee, all comforts, all afflictions, all relations; this grace turneth all waters into wine, this is the true Philoſophers ſtone, that makes every thing gold; ſo that we are to call things good or bad according to their operations in a way of grace, or ſinne. If the great things of this world make thee more vain, ſinfull, diſſolute, then they are bad things; if the ſad and miſerable things of this world make thee full of faith, heavenly-mindedneſſe and zeal, then they are good things; if thou art gracious, God will with-hold no good thing from thee; All things
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:30767:183"/>
are thine, whether life, or death, things preſent, or things to come.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Grace will inable a man to all conditions,</hi> to goe through variety and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges <note place="margin">3.</note> of all temptations; for they being gold can indure the ſire, when the droſſe melteth, they being corn bear the winnowing, when the chaff bloweth away. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> knoweth how to abound, and how to want, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 12. Grace makes a man of that ſtrong conſtitution, that he can endure extream colds, and extream heats, as you ſee in <hi>David</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Grace is the great comfort to a man in time of diſtreſſe, dangers, and feare</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>of death.</hi> Not that a man may put truſt in it, ſo he is to worſhip God onely, but as a teſtimony of his intereſt in Gods grace and favour: Thus <hi>Paul</hi> at his death is comforted from his grace, That he had fought a good fight: So <hi>Hezekiah</hi> when in thoſe publick ſtraits, and private ſentence of death upon him, what bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth him up, but that he had lived a gracious life? and thus did <hi>Nehemiah</hi> alſo. Oh beloved, think not to be always merry, jocund; know, one time or other diſtreſſes will ſeize you, howſoever you cannot eſcape the pangs of death: what then will wealth, friends, carnall pomp and greatneſſe avail thee? Oh the teſtimony of thy heart upon good ground, that thou haſt lived graciouſly, been afraid of ſinne, walked according to the Rule, will be more joy to thee then all the world; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the other ſide, at the time of death, to have thy heart tell thee, Thou haſt lived a Swearer, Drunkard, prophane Perſon, negligent of all good things, and now art falling into hell, and the hands of the Devill whom thou haſt ſerved, and whoſe work thou haſt done all thy life time: What horror and terror muſt this fill thee with?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> Is grace thus excellent? Then oh, that you might be transformed into the likeneſſe of it! What will other things availe thee without this, if God hath given thee health, but no grace, riches, but no grace? Be no longer like Swine, to refuſe the Pearl for mire and filth: Have ſuch thoughts and eſteem of Grace, as if thou wert a dying, and preſently to give up the ghoſt. If it be worth the having then, its worth the enjoying now. And woe, again woe to thee, who haſt mocked at grace as the greateſt folly, and counted the gracious man a mad man, becauſe he would not run into the like exceſſe as thou doſt: Thou wilt at laſt ſee him the happy man. Theſe things in generall you will acknowledge; but why do ye not apply them in particular?</p>

                  <p>HAving diſpatched the nature, properties, and effects of inherent grace, I come (according to my Method) to detect two counterfeits of this, and they are <hi>Natural Honeſty,</hi> and <hi>Moral virtue;</hi> for theſe two make a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſhew, and ſeem to be like the two great lights in the world, if humane reaſon may be judge, and I begin with natural honeſty out of this Text.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle in this Chapter brings in an heavy indictment and charge, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jew and Gentile, wrapping up all mankind in their winding ſheet, as being dead in ſin and iniquity; and whereas it might be objected <hi>verſe 14. That the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles cannot be found ſinners,</hi> becauſe <hi>where no law is, there is no tranſgreſſion:</hi> He anſwereth this objection, informing us, That though the Gentiles were without a Law in ſome ſenſe, yet not without it in another: They were without a Law writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and promulged, as the Jews had, but not without a Law ingraffed in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, whereby they had common dictates about good and evil: Which Natural honeſty was a Law to them in many things; <hi>And therefore they not having a Law, are a Law to themſelves.</hi> This being the ſumm of the Anſwer, he illuſtrates this work of God in mens hearts naturally,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By the Title, <hi>The work of the Law,</hi> i. e. The ſubſtance of the ten Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which do ſummarily comprehend all duties to be done, and all ſins to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the manner, <hi>It is written in their hearts.</hi> Though it be implanted, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed, yet the Apoſtle uſeth this expreſſion of <hi>Writing,</hi> becauſe the Moral Law was written on Two Tables; onely you muſt not take this expreſſion like that of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Jer. 31. as <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and others have done, where God makes a Covenant, <hi>To write his Law in their hearts;</hi> for that is a gracious writing <hi>de novo,</hi> whereby God inſuſeth grace into his Children, enabling them to walk in his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with all propenſity and delight, from ſanctified principles within. But here he ſpeaks of that natural ingraffing which God hath made upon the conſciences of men, whereby they judge good to be imbraced, and evil to be abhorred. It is true, there are learned men, and moſt of the Ancients go that ways alſo, who expound this of Gentiles, but believers and converted; for it may ſeem to attribute too
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:30767:184"/>
much to Nature, to ſay, <hi>That Heathens do by nature the things of the Law:</hi> but when you hear in what ſenſe they are ſaid to do it, you will quickly perceive that to be no ſuch great matter, as may put them in a capacity of ſalvation. I ſhall not trouble you with the interpretation of <hi>Flaccius Illyricus,</hi> much toyling about the ſenſe of this place, which makes ſo directly againſt his opinion about Originall ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, This Natural honeſty imprinted in mens conſciences, is deſcribed by an external effect, <hi>They ſhew it,</hi> viz. in the actions of their lives, <hi>abſtaining from whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, injuſtice, and murther.</hi> 2. By Internal effects, <hi>The witneſs and workings of Conſcience,</hi> ſometimes by accuſation upon things ill done, ſometimes by excuſe and approbation, when well done. Interpreters finde ſome difficulty about the ſenſe of the greek words <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, In the mean while accuſing, or excuſing one another. That is, as ſome expound it, <hi>They condemn one and another,</hi> by reaſon of the natural light of conſcience left in them about ill doing, or well doing. But others, as it is in the Margent, render it <hi>between themſelves,</hi> in this ſenſe, Every man hath a court within in his own heart, where there are accuſations or defences according to the nature of the works we do, Every one hath a judge in his breaſt, and a Tribunal or terrible Bar in his Conſcience within, by which he is condemned or acquicted. This expoſition I like beſt; onely I would render <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, not <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween,</hi> or <hi>the mean while,</hi> but <hi>Alternatim, By change and viciſſitude,</hi> as the Greek word is ſometimes uſed: So that the Apoſtles meaning is, That there is ſuch a Law about good and evil in mens hearts, appeareth, in that all Heathens have had their Conſciences one while accuſing them, and at another time excuſing them; one while they have been terrified, and another time comforted and quieted in their Conſciences, according as they have deported themſelves. Now to the whole expoſition of this Text in the ſenſe declared, may be objected all thoſe places of Scripture which ſay, <hi>We are dead in ſin:</hi> And <hi>Chap. 3. 10, 11, 12. &amp;c.</hi> that long deſcription of mans <hi>Natural filthineſs,</hi> where <hi>none, no not one is ſaid to underſtand,</hi> or to be righteous; eſpecially that famous place ſeems directly to thwart this, where it is ſaid, <hi>That the imaginations of the thoughts of a mans heart are onely evil, and that continually.</hi> But here may be eaſily an happy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord found out; for thoſe natural impreſſions and inclinations, which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout good and evil, are imperfect and inſufficient to enable us to do that which is every way good in every circumſtance; and it is onely of ſome particular no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious things, and it is onely for the matter done, not the manner of it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though Heathens have done good things, yet they never did them well; and though they have abſtained from ſins, yet they never did it from pure and right grounds. Thus while they did the works of the Law, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencies were thus buſie and active within them, yet they were corrupted and defiled; And therefore as the Apoſtle argueth, <hi>Their very mindes and Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences were defiled alſo,</hi> Tit. 1. 15.</p>
                  <p>This may ſuffice for explication at this time; more may be added hereafter: for this Text doth contain admirable practical matter, being fruitful, and bearing twins as it were.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That there is naturally implanted in mens conſciences, ſuch common notions</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſ. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>and apprehenſions about God, and that which is good and evil; that thereby their conſciences are very active within them; and they forbear ſome ſins, and do ſome good things in their outward converſation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Though theſe principles and dictates of conſcience within, carry men out to never</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obſ.</hi> 2. The works of the Law in a mans conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, may be conſidered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a mans three-fold eſtate.</note> 
                     <hi>ſo much natural honeſty, yet it is not Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall begin with the firſt: And for the underſtanding of it conſider, That we may ſpeak of the work of the Law in a mans conſcience, according to a mans three-fold eſtate.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That of Perfection and innocency, wherein God made Adam before his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy:</hi>
                     <pb n="336" facs="tcp:30767:185"/>
And thus the work of the Law was perfectly engraven in <hi>Adams</hi> heart, both for knowledge to diſcern, and power to perform. This was a Star ſure e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to guide <hi>Adam</hi> to eternal happineſſe: Adams ſoul was not made like a blank paper, for Virtue or Vice to be written on it, in a meer indifferency; but he was made after the image of God, which was righteouſneſſe, and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. It was an Image, the whole and univerſall reſemblance of God, and every Lineament was curiouſly, and accurately drawn. By reaſon of this, there was no duty to be done, but <hi>Adam</hi> knew it, there being no ignorance, imprudence, blindeneſſ, or folly in his minde; and hereby he had a propenſion, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, facility, and delight in what God commanded, no commandment being an heavy yoke to him.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, <hi>If we speak of man turned an Apoſtate, and become a wretched pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digall, loſing that ſtock God ſet him up with;</hi> Then though nothing of that holy image be left in him, yet his underſtanding and conſcience being faculties of his reaſonable ſoul, they abide ſtill, elſe he could not be a man. And although theſe are wholly corrupted, as to do any thing that is truely good, yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in man fallen, common notions and principles about religion and honeſtly, which ſerve for many ſpecial uſes hereafter to be mentioned: And although in ſome theſe have been defaced, and they have grown paſt feeling, and their ſenſe of God almoſt extinct, yet for the general theſe principles have been active in all men.</p>
                  <p>And Laſtly, <hi>We may ſpeak of theſe Divine reliques in man, as reformed and enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by Gods word, and furbiſhed by ſupernatural directions:</hi> And herein they are wonderfully furthering godlineſſe; for grace doth not put out thoſe little ſparks, but enkindleth them to a flame: So that natural principles elevated and perfected by ſupernatural, carry a man forward to all real godlineſſe. <hi>Now my diſcourſe ſhall be limited to natural light and power, while we are corrupted in our ſinfull eſtate;</hi> and in the examination of this, we may ſee diſcovered, that though nature hath many things laudable and commendable, yet ſhe is not to ſit in the Throne of Grace; but <note place="margin">Why God hath left the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in man fallen. 1. That God might be known and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged in all the world.</note> rather nature is graces foot-ſtool.</p>
                  <p>In the next place let us conſider why God hath left theſe notions (as ſo many ſparks of fire raked up in aſhes) in our hearts.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, <hi>That hereby God might be known and acknowledged in all the world:</hi> That though men by nature did but grope in the dark, when they enquired what God was, yet it was clear to them there was a God, whom they conceived ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, and then whom nothing could be better. This the Apoſtle calls, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>That which may be known of God,</hi> Rom. 1. 19. Indeed this naturall knowledge of God is ſo confuſe, uncertain, and corrupted through carnall imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, that in the Scripture phraſe they are ſaid <hi>to be ignorant of God, and to be without God, and that God is onely known in his Church:</hi> But yet that they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to ſome kinde of apprehenſion of him, is plain by <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. where they are condemned <hi>becauſe they did not glorifie God, as they knew God.</hi> This is a ſure Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ome. That there is no meer natural Atheiſt in judgement; there may be an Atheiſt in affection and deſire, wiſhing there were no God to govern and order all things, puniſhing men for their wickedneſſe; in which ſenſe the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>The fool hath ſaid in his heart, there is no God, Pſal.</hi> 14. 1. But to be perſwaded in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there are none ſo by nature, or very rare: <hi>God hath ſet this Candle in the dark places of the belly, to keep men in aw, and to acknowledge a power above them.</hi> Men that have not had the glorious Sunne of the word to walk by, yet they have had this Torch to go by in the night. And truly the improvement of this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral principle, that there is a God, might make every wicked mans joynts to tremble; for if thou canſt not raſe it out of thy heart, Why doſt thou not glorifie him as God? Why art thou not afraid of him as a God? <note place="margin">2 That we may be the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Therefore theſe practicall principles of good and evill abide in us, that
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:30767:185"/>
ſo we might be the more inexcuſable:</hi> For when men have not lived according to that which the light of nature would have directed them to, their condemnation will be very juſt, themſelves being Judges, and their own conſciences bearing witneſſe to it. When therefore men live in ſuch ſinnes as Nature condemneth, ſuch are uncleanneſſe, unjuſt dealings, lying and forſwearing; they do not need <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law, nor <hi>Pauls</hi> Goſpel to condemn them; they have that in their own hearts which will accuſe and overthrow them. The Apoſtle many times provoketh to Duty by this, 1. <hi>Cor. 11. 14. Doth not even nature teach thee?</hi> Oh how often may even Chriſtians be ſeverely rebuked? Doth not even Nature teach thee, that to Lye, Steal, commit Adultery, are horrid ſins? How then canſt thou break this ſtrong bond in which Natural light hath tyed thee? To be condemned, becauſe we do not believe in Chriſt, would not be unleſſe Chriſt had been propounded to us: we need ſupernaturall revelation to ſome duties; but the Duties enjoyned by Nature, they oblige us, though no Scripture had been written, no Miniſters did inform us; though none ſhould bid us fulfill them. Thou haſt a Doctor or Teacher in thy own breaſt, which condemneth thee for what thou doeſt, therefore art thou greatly inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>God leaveth theſe practical impreſſions upon us, that ſo what is good</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. That what is good may be honoured.</note> 
                     <hi>may be honoured and praiſed, what is evill may be matter of ſhame and reproach.</hi> It is an excellent thing to conſider, That the things of piety, and juſtice, and all goodneſſe, have a remarkable reverence in the hearts of all men. Who would not be thought to be pious, to be juſt, to be righteous? Now how could theſe come to have ſuch Authority amongſt men, if there were not ſomething in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to approve it? So wickedneſſe, that is condemned and cenſured by all mankinde: Now no man is willing to be thought an ungodly man, an unjuſt man; and whence is all this, but ſtill from this work of the Law written in mens hearts? Hence are thoſe rules, <hi>Omnis peccans eſt ignorans,</hi> and <hi>Nemo poteſt velle malum, quâ malum,</hi> Evill is forward to come in Goodneſſes clothes, elſe it could not be embraced by any man. This makes much to juſtifie the nature of what is good and right; for all men, though never ſo ſavage or barbarous, they do adore it in the generall, though in the particular they have greatly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>This Law is written in mens hearts, that ſo kingdomes and common-wealths,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. That king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and Common-wealths may be preſerved.</note> 
                     <hi>and all humane ſocieties may be preſerved:</hi> For if there were not Dictates about God and righteouſneſſe, Kingdomes would preſently be turned into rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries, and horrid confuſions. We admire, and that juſtly, the providence of God in bounding the waters, that they do not overwhelm the earth: but much more admirable is Gods power in preſerving humane ſocieties, that men are not Wolves and Tygers, committing all bloody outrages. What is the cauſe of this? No outward power or ſtrength ſo much, as an inbred apprehenſion about a God, and a ſtrong conviction of the conſcience, what is righteous and juſt to be done; And therefore whenſoever this hedge is broken down, the very flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates of all wickedneſſe is preſently ſet open; and bleſſed be God, that hath put ſuch a bridle in the mouth of Man, who by ſinne hath made himſelf ſo bruitiſh.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>God hath left theſe ſacred remnants in us, that there might be a ground</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5. That there might be a ground of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</note> 
                     <hi>of converſion and regeneration:</hi> For howſoever we are ſaid to be dead in ſinne, and our hearts are compared to ſtones, and we reſembled to bruit beaſts; yet that is in reſpect of any active capacity or ability to do what is good, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe God dealeth with us in a way of reaſon and argument, anſwerable to thoſe Natural Dictates within. Thus when <hi>Paul</hi> preached of Temperance, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and the world to come, <hi>Felix</hi> trembled, becauſe there were ſome princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of reaſon within him aſſenting to thoſe Truths which <hi>Paul</hi> preached. Indeed
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:30767:186"/>
the Papiſts fouly miſtake, who make regeneration to be nothing but the actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and exciting of thoſe inward principles by grace: As if a man ſhould blow up and inflame ſome little ſparks of fire covered under aſhes: and by this means they make Nature co-operate with Grace; this contradicts thoſe expreſſions where God is ſaid to make an heart of fleſh, <hi>and write his Law in us;</hi> for by theſe Texts it is apparent, That God infuſeth the firſt power into us, and puts in a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſtrength, and doth not excite, or ſtir up our Natural ſtrength: So that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this Natural writing, there muſt be a Gracious writing, elſe we certainly periſh. But yet theſe natural principles of religion and honeſty, are good foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations to work upon; to preach to men and not to beaſts. I ſpeak (ſaith <hi>Paul)</hi> to wiſe men, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 10. 15. judge what I ſay. We preach to men that ſhould have Reaſon, and Natural Conſcience working in them: Now if ſo, How is it that thou art not converted? That thou haſt not left thy ſins? Set upon a way of ſtrict Godlineſſe? for let thy Naturall conſcience work; give it leave to argue; hear it ſay what it can; Doth not that cloſe with the holy Truths we preach to you? Your affections (happily) do not your love and deſire do not, but your Natural conſcience, that is terrified; that ſaith, this is religion, this is juſt; therefore it muſt be done: That ſaith, thy ungodlineſſe, thy luſts are ſins, and therefore to be avoided. Oh hear what that preacher in thy breaſt preacheth to thee ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times: And (beloved) this is the great advantage that the Miniſters of the Word have while they rebuke ſin, exhort to Duties: Though we make men our enemies, yet their conſciences are our friends: While your corrupt affections make you rage and ſret at what is good, yet your conſciences they ſpeak for it, and approve it. That therefore the word of God might have a ſubject to work upon, ſomething to cloſe with, there are theſe fiery ſparks of light and Truth burning in mens breaſts: So that there is no man we preach unto, but if he would let his Natural Conſcience be judge, and determine about his leaving ſin, and doing good, the Verdict would be on the Miniſters ſide. Here is the controverſie, the word of God commands thee to caſt away thoſe ſins thou liveſt in, it threatens thee with all the Curſes in the Law. Well, thy corrupt heart pleads to the contrary, theſe luſts are ſweet, are profitable, thou art accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to them; and then thou haſt many carnal prejudices; To do ſo, would be to live ſtrictly, preciſely, ſingularly; and what repute that hath with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, all know: So that it is againſt their good name and their credit, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, to be ſo wary about ſin; thus thy corrupt affections plead. Well then, put the iſſue of this debate to the Naturall light of Conſcience, hear what that will ſay, and preſently that will conclude, That which is good and righteous, is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred before what is pleaſant and profitable: That will ſay, God is to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before man: if you will go on, and live thus, and do thus, I muſt do my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; I cannot but accuſe you, terrifie you, arraign you: I cannot but give you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſharp wounds: And howſoever you may for a while through pleaſure, and pride, and earthly affections ſtop my cry, and ſtifle my voice, yet one day I ſhall roar ſo in thy ears, that for horrour thou wilt not be able to endure it. This is the very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> about every wicked man; and therefore think not to bear it out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the word; do not go about to ſtop the mouth of Natural conſcience. Thou mayeſt for a while <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>God hath imprinted theſe principles in us, That ſo Men might abound in civil honeſty, and Moral virtues;</hi> which although they are not true grace, they <note place="margin">6. That ſo men might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in civil honeſty and virtue.</note> are but copper, and not gold, yet hereby men are leſſe wicked, and ſo God is not ſo much diſhonoured, <hi>Camillus</hi> is better then <hi>Verres: Fabricius</hi> then <hi>Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line:</hi> Mens lives are not ſo much to the reproach of Gods name, and his exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great diſhonour; for howſoever it be true, That theſe principles of Nature
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:30767:186"/>
doe not encline us to good truely, and upon a right ground, yet by them we are curbed from acting all the wickedneſſe our hearts would accompliſh; and ſo are thereby as Wolves and Tygars tyed up in chains. The Apoſtle ſuppoſeth this, when he ſaith of the Heathens, <hi>Rom. 1. That they detain the truth in unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe;</hi> That is, the natural knowledge which they had of God and righteouſneſſe, would have provoked them to what is holy and good; but they violently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this Truth; they kept it from being active, and burſting out like fire in their lives. Is not <hi>Medeas</hi> caſe, the caſe of many men, They ſee better things, and approve them, but they follow the worſt. Oh conſider thy ſelf, Doeſt not thou inwardly think there is a better life to be lived then I live; a better courſe to be taken for Heaven then I take: But ſtill thy ſins and corruptions turn thee out of the way. Oh it is to be feared that this is a reigning univerſal ſin; for Men having lived ſo long under the Goſpel, cannot become ſo bruitiſh and ſtupid in their imaginations, but that they know when they ſinne, and when they doe well, How then can they endure to live againſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>

                     <p>BUt you will ſay, If God hath left theſe principles in us, How comes it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that in many men they are aſleep? Do not all Men almoſt runne into thoſe ſins which the Law of Nature forbids? How is it that Men ſwear; lye, commit whoredomes, and do injuſtice, if they have ſuch a School-maſter within to teach them? Who would not ſay by the lives of moſt men, That theſe are overwhelmed and quite buried? and if it were among Heathens, it were no great wonder; but that it ſhould be amongſt Chriſtians, is the great amazement: For they have not onely this Natural light inbred in them, but ſupernatural light alſo revealed unto them. So that for men under the Goſpell, to become ſo ſottiſh and ſenſeleſſe about what is good, and what is ſin, is beyond all expreſſion intollerable.</p>
                     <p>The grounds of this ſenſeleſneſſe and ſtupifaction of Conſcience may be theſe.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, <hi>Ill education, and long continued custome in evill,</hi> for theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <note place="margin">Ill education &amp; cuſtom in ſin.</note> a ſecond nature quickly; and the firſt Nature is obliterated as it were. Men that live conſtantly by great Noyſes, they regard them not; but ſtrangers are much diſquieted with them: So what men have been brought up in; they ſaw nothing but wickedneſſe and prophanneſſe in their parents lives, and in the families where they were taught; this takes away the horror of ſinne: They ſee their Anceſtours, and learned men, and great men, they have made no matter of Godlineſſe, but ſinned as they pleaſed; this roots out all aw of ſinne in the Conſcience: Some Heathens baniſhed out all Poets, and Comedies, and Tragoedies upon this ground, becauſe their Gods were brought in, doing ſome wickedneſſe or other: Now they well argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, That men would be much more hardened in their impieties, when they had their Gods for a pattern.</p>
                     <p>And thus it is here, Children, for the moſt part, and ſervants, they have no other God then their Parents or Maſters; and if they obſerve them to drink, and ſwear, and be naught, they immediately conclude, they may do it alſo: ſo that if you ask, How is it that ſo many men live without any ſenſe of a God, or Conſcience about ſinne, enquire into their Education; ask how they
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:30767:187"/>
have been brought up: Did not their Parents, their Anceſtors, did not their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies they lived in abound in ſin; and then without Gods miraculous grace upon them, they cannot come to be of another judgement: and this is the reaſon, Why the Scripture doth ſo often call upon Parents to teach their Children the fear of God, and to bring them up in his knowledge; for if that be neglected, thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall ſparks of honeſty will quickly be put out. And much like to Education is Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, men habituated in evill wayes are paſt all feeling preſently. Thoſe who at firſt had ſome checks of Conſcience, and akings of heart, when once plunged into ſinne, they fear nothing, they feel nothing, they apprehend neither heaven or hell; but as the Salt water of the Sea when it hath over-flowed the Banks, and covered ſome grounds, leaveth ſuch a ſaltiſh, brackiſh diſpoſition in the ground, that it can never be got out again, or return to its former nature. Thus Cuſtome in any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane way takes away all ſenſe and feeling, ſo far, that they never come to that ingenuity and tenderneſſe of conſcience which once they had. How is it that once thou daredſt not omit prayer, private, or in family? That once thou couldeſt not give way to unchaſt company? Thou couldeſt not endure the company of ungodly men: But now theſe things are never any trouble to thee; they are no torment to thee. This is a cuſtome, this is a prophane uſe upon thy ſpirit: Oh then put out the ſparks of fire before it be kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; ſtop the leak at firſt, before the ſhip be filled with water; reſiſt the principles of ſinne: Of all ſorts of people we have leaſt hope of doing good unto them, who are ſetled in a ſinfull way; that can ſinne without fear, or any regret of Conſcience: For theſe men have not that foundation in them, which we ſhould work upon: For our preaching doth good to thoſe who ſet Conſcience a work, that let Natural light cloſe with what is delivered.</p>

This ſate heavy on the heathens ſpirits, whereupon they have made Tractates upon this queſtion, Why it ſometimes fals ill to a good man, and well to a wicked, as <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> wherein they have behaved themſelves in ſome meaſure well, gravely acquitting Gods providence; and had they enjoyed Scripture-light, they had eaſily waded through that deep: And it is no wonder that theſe blaſts have made Heathens ſtagger and reele too and fio, for we have the eminent Cedars in Gods Church almoſt overturned by it. <hi>David,</hi> a godly man, greatly exerciſed in ſeverall condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, though alwaies finding God turning ſtone into bread for him, when he was in any wilderneſſe, yet how pitifully doth he toil and labour under this temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73. that thoſe who were wicked, they proſpered, they had their hearts deſire; they had no pangs, nor troubles; and this did ſo far prevail, that in a ſudden paſſion, he ſpeaks like an Atheiſt, <hi>Verily, I have waſhed my hands in innocency and have cleanſed my heart in vain.</hi> On monſtrous ſpeech, and dreadfull to come out of a godly mans mouth: to ſay, it was a vain thing to fear God, a vain thing to walk juſtly and innocently, if he had done wickedly, he ſhould have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpered better.

Alas, the Scripture doth evidently informe us of juſt, and wiſe ends, why God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſuffered his enemies to proſper, and godlineſſe to be perſecuted, and his Saints made Martyrs for his Name ſake; ſo that the Word of God is the trueſt Glaſſe to repreſent the face of all things here below, eſpecially that is ſatisfactory, that God hath appointed a day of judgement for the whole world, when all ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and be judged for what is done in the earth; and as here below they do not complain that Malefactors are not executed before the Aſſizes, but patiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that time: So are we quietly to wait that great day, wherein God will ſettle all things according to their nature and deſerts.

Now ſuch men have very little apprehenſion upon ſinne, or godlineſſe; were it not for the ſhape of their bodies, you might judge them beaſts, for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard onely the things of ſenſe. Thus as the glorious Sunne is eclipſed by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Moon; ſo doe arthy thoughts, and earthy affections obſcure that petry light, which ſhineth in a mans breaſt; and certainly, if love of the world hath put out the Goſpel, and Scripture light that ſhined in ſome mens breaſts, as the Scripture gives pregnant proofs of it; no wonder if it do wholly extinguiſh the light of nature.

As (I ſay) it is in ſupernaturall light, thus it fareth with naturall, the continual accuſations, and ſmitings of Conſcience, through cuſtome men harden themſelves againſt, and at laſt contemn them.

If the Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. makes it ſuch a grievous and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous ſinne to eat any meat doubting, or to doe any thing doubting, whether it be a ſinne or not; then how grievous a thing is it to doe thoſe things, about which thou haſt no doubts, but clear convictions that they are ſins: As for example, take the unjuſt, deceitfull man in his trade, Doſt thou doubt whether thou ſinneſt in lying, cozening, and over-reaching? Doſt thou ſcruple whether it be a ſinne? No, but thy Conſcience plainly telleth thee, This was not lawfull, this was not juſt. So in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in any groſſe prophaneneſſe, Do you commit theſe things, doubting whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be ſinnes? or doſt thou not plainly accuſe thy ſelf in what thou doſt?

                     <hi>a juſt judgement of God upon men, becauſe of the abuſe of Natural light:</hi> when men have not lived as they have known, nor walked as they have known, God as a juſt judge hath delivered them up to their own unnaturall luſts, which hath been more grievous than to be delivered up to Lions and Bears, and to be torn in pieces by them. This is evidently ſet down, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. at large; where the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, not walking according to thoſe implanted principles within them, but breaking the bounds that nature had ſet them, God gave them up to all manner of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Sixtly, <hi>Another cauſe that will dull, if not extinguiſh thoſe principles of conſcience, is a wilfull turning away our thoughts and conſiderations from what they ſpeak within</hi>

Thus <hi>Cain</hi> full of trembling, to ſhake this off, he travaileth, and buildeth Cities, and all to have a quiet mind. Thus as when the Prophets of God called to mourning and ſackcloth, there was gladneſſe, and making of all melody: ſo when Conſcience accuſeth, condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, calls for repentance and reformation, they labour to make a greater noiſe that may drown this. It's true the acts and dictates of Conſcience are not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to our wills, <hi>Quoad ſpecificationem,</hi> as they ſay. A man cannot think that to be good which he deſireth, nor that to be evill which he would not; but againſt and contrary to mens wills and affections they ſay, This is good, and this evil: but <hi>quoad exercitium,</hi> in reſpect of the exerciſe of it; So they may wilfully turn away their thoughts from conſidering what is ſaid to them. Thus as the thief hareth the light, becauſe his deeds are diſcovered thereby; ſo a wicked man dares not give heed to what conſcience ſaith, he runneth from it as much as he can, becauſe it is wholly againſt the courſe of his life; ſo that if you never minde or conſider, what that law of God in thy heart ſpeaks to thee: it's no wonder if thou art never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: But if thou wouldſt commune with thy own heart, and ſearch it, bid all other things ſtand aloof off, thou and conſcience will conſider together, thou and conſcience will examine together; if this were done, thy ſins ſhould not lodge a night longer with thee.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>A prephane jollity, and a carnall merriment,</hi> this alſo weakens the voice of naturall Conſcience; ſome men are as afraid of any ſerious ſober thoughts <note place="margin">7.

This was their diſpoſition, who ſaid, <hi>Let us eate and drink, for to morrow we ſhall dye.</hi> Oh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſs,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:30767:189"/>
rather let us repent and mourn, and forſake our ſins, for to morrow we ſhall dye; but theſe ſwiniſh Epicures, they made the clean contrary uſe, We have but a ſhort time to live, we may not hold out till to morrow, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us be merry while we may, when we are gone, all is gone; we will take our pleaſures while we may have them. This jolly prophaneneſs, puts out all the eyes of Conſcience; now all his care and thought is, but how he may be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, how he may be glutting and ſatisfying his luſts; as for the day of judgement, or thoſe ſad Sermons which his conſcience may preach to him, he deſireth to hear no more of them, he wil make much of one while he may. But Oh! what is this making much? Its making up much wrath, much miſery, and much horror for thy ſelf: That which thou ſaidſt is making mirth, is indeed making nothing for thee, its the eternal perdition of thy ſoul and body.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, <hi>Neglect to stir up and quicken theſe natural Dictates, by all thoſe ſpecial and ſupernatural helps which God hath appointed;</hi> not that theſe can ever <note place="margin">8.

For an inſtance of the former defection, take <hi>David</hi> and others; Who could think that ever they ſhould commit ſuch bloody and hideous ſins as they did? Where was their grace? Where were the fiery darts of Gods ſpirit in their hearts inflaming them? Nothing but ſin and the fleſh appeareth in them, they are like a tree in winter, that diſcovers no ſap or life; like a man in a dead Lethargy, that manifeſts no breath: Now then, if the ſupernatural work of grace in a godly man, may be ſo ſtupified and over-whelmed, is it any wonder if theſe dictates of nature be ſilent? But as in the godly, theſe things are overtopt by their ſluggiſhneſs, and careleſs walking; ſo in natural men, whatſoever dictate may be to good, it wholly dyeth, as ſparks of fire dye, becauſe there is nothing to blow on them, and inkindle them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Therefore may there be no declaring of this Law in mens hearts, becauſe</hi>

And as the Malefactor would willingly kill the Judge, if it were in his power, that ſo the Judge may not condemn him; thus the corrupt luſts and affections of men, make them deſirous to ſtifle conſcience, that ſo conſcience may not condemn or accuſe them. There is nothing that a wicked man is ſo afraid of, as to be diſquieted in his ſins: Our tongues are ours (ſay thoſe prophane men) who ſhall control us? Therefore that they may not ſtand in awe, and ſo be kept from ſin, as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. 4. they labor to muzzle the mouth of conſcience, that it bite not: A vain and fooliſh attempt indeed, for when God makes this roar and rage in a man, all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, ſports and paſtimes in the world, cannot allay the noiſe of it; but yet men will attempt theſe vain things: Fear of natural light, makes men hate it, and the hatred of it, makes men put it out if they can.</p>

The next thing to be undertaken is, to ſhew wherein men do demonſtrate theſe <note place="margin">6</note> dictates of Conſcience, and how far they have been prevalent upon them to that which is good: And the diſcovery of theſe things, is an excellent way to raiſe bluſhing in the faces of many Chriſtians, and to provoke them to jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie, when they ſee that done in <hi>Athens</hi> or <hi>Ethnical Rome,</hi> which is ſcarce done in <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> eſpecially thoſe who are the people of God, and pretend to an higher and ſupernatural light, muſt diligently beware, leſt they be outſtript in thoſe moral honeſt things, which the very light of nature teacheth ſome men.

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>This Law of God in mens hearts, is demonſtrated by theſe excellent Tractates and diſcourſes, which many by the help of natural light onely have written;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <note place="margin">Wherein the Law of God in mens hearts is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated. 1.

Thus the Moral diſcourſes of <hi>Seneca, Plutarch, Plato,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Stoicks,</hi> ſpeak very high things about that which is vertuous, and that which is vicious; inſomuch that many mens Divinity in their Sermons, or Contemplations and Devotions, have been nothing but the choice flowers pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led out of their garden. This (I confeſs) is juſtly to be blamed, and ſeverely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved:
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:30767:190"/>
for Scripture matter, either in things of faith, or things to be done, doth as much excell all thoſe Notions, either in majeſty or purity, as the Sun doth an <hi>Ignis Fatuus,</hi> or any Ignited Meteore: But I know not how it falls out, whether of the witty invention in them, or eloquent expreſſions, thoſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Authors have delighted ſome, more then <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms, or <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles; eſpecially many of the Jeſuits in their Religious Tractates, ſtuff their diſcourſes with <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Contemplations, or Moral Inventions. Now although it be true, that it were a great error to take <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> though a great Prophet, for Chriſt, much more a <hi>Seneca</hi> or a <hi>Plato</hi> (though ſtiled Divine) for a Chriſt; yet if we ſpeak of the ſphaere of nature, how far ſhe hath been able to accuſe vice, and plead for vertue, herein they have been wonderful; take <hi>Tullies</hi> Book <hi>De Oſſiciis:</hi> If men and their publique converſation, did keep to that fidelity in words, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs in deeds, and love to the publique againſt all particular profit, it would make the lives of men very admirable, though not godly: And it is a great honor to thoſe Books of the Heathens, that the Apoſtle himſelf doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alledge verſes out of ſuch Authors, and that for morality alſo; witneſs that ſentence, <hi>Evil words corrupt good maners;</hi> which is ſanctified (ſaith <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian)</hi> or made Eccleſiaſtical, as <hi>Hierom,</hi> by <hi>Paul,</hi> it being a verſe of the <hi>Comedian Menander;</hi> and it is true by experience, that evil words and diſcourſes, ſuch as ſome <hi>Corinthians</hi> had, which did privately, by ſome reaſonings fetched from Philoſophy, endeavor to weaken the Chriſtian faith about the Reſurrection, do quickly infect mens lives: and as the Apoſtles, ſo miniſters may ſometimes upon fit occaſions, uſe ſentences out of thoſe Authors, ſo that they do it not too frequently, or with affectation, or thereby diſparaging the powerful ſimplicity and divine Plainneſs of the Scripture. The many Books therefore and Diſcourſes, which men by the help of natural Conſcience have made, to the ordering of mens lives in a vertuous way, are a ſure demonſtration of this Law written in their hearts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The wiſe, juſt and righteous Laws which many of their Law-givers</hi>

It is true, in ſome things their wiſeſt Law-givers have eſtabliſhed notorious wickedneſs, but that doth not hinder the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of their many other good Laws. If then Heathens have ſuch thoughts about wicked actions, that they deem them worthy to be puniſhed with all diſgrace, contempt and reproach, yea ſome of them with death it ſelf, and that in the moſt cruel maner. This doth evidently declare, that they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred principles about good and evil; and upon this ground it is, that the Apoſtle ſpeaking of Magiſtrates, even Paganiſh, ſaith, <hi>They are the Miniſters of God, to thee for good,</hi> Rom. 13. That they are a terror to the evil, and not to the good; if thou doeſt well, be not afraid, but if thou doeſt ill, fear, becauſe he doth not bear the ſword in vain: So that this is a manifeſt conviction of the Conſcience of every wicked man. If thou art a prophane, unjuſt, intemperate
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:30767:191"/>
man, why art thou afraid the Magiſtrate ſhould ſee? Thou feareſt his eyes, Is it not becauſe of an implanted principle, That good is to be incouraged, and evil to be avoided? and the very fear of the Magiſtrates ſword, keeps a world of people from that actual wickedneſs, which otherwiſe they would be plunged into: So that if you look over all the Societies of men in the world, that have a Government, wherein ſome command, and ſome obey, you will conclude, All this proclaimeth to the world, men have thoughts there is a God, and that wicked actions deſerve juſt puniſhments.</p>

                     </gap>, a Temple for all gods, thinking themſelves herein Religious, that they did not refuſe the Religion of any nation: Their Temples, their Altars, their Sacrifices, their Reverence to their Prieſts, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive charge and coſt they were at in keeping up their Religious Worſhip, though they beſpake miſerable madneſs and confuſion upon their ſpirits; yet they alſo demonſtrate innate apprehenſions about a God, and that Divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage we owe to him. And as for ſome, who were called Atheiſts, its thought therefore they had that brand on them, not that they were againſt a God, but becauſe they derided the multitude, and the ſuperſtitious obſervations of the gods then worſhipped. Its plain, <hi>Seneca</hi> thought the Romans guilty of much ridiculouſneſs in their Divine Worſhip, and wrote a Book about it, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, which is loſt; and although he thus was convinced of their vanity, yet he diligently performed that external Worſhip, <hi>Tanquam legibus juſſam, non Diis gratam;</hi> As a thing commanded by the Laws and Cuſtoms of men, not at all acceptable to the gods. As they were frequent thus in Adoration, ſo they performed it after a grave and ſolemn maner; witneſs that cry of the Prieſts, <hi>Hoc age,</hi> minde this onely: and certainly the reverence, attention and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of Heathens to their Idols, will condemn the ſluggiſhneſs, dulneſs and drowſie irreverence, which Chriſtians ſhew to the true God, in their Worſhip of him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>They declare this Law written in them, by the work of conſcience terrifying them upon any evil actions:</hi> What fear and horror hath been upon heathens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, <note place="margin">4.

Alas, we would think ſuch things ſhould be ſpoken of onely among Chriſtians, and where the word that is preached, is the diſcerner and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverer of the thoughts and actions of all men; but even among them that never ſaw this Sun, there are divers ſayings, commending and admiring the bleſſedneſs of living ſo, as not being conſcious to our ſelves of any groſs ſinful ways: <hi>Nil conſcire ſibi, &amp;c.</hi> To be conſcious unto a mans ſelf of no evil, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt action, is that onely thing which may make a man happy: <hi>Hic murus aheneus eſto;</hi> that is a brazen wall to beat back all darts; As the ſweet nurſe in old age, as <hi>Pindar</hi> calls it. Oh that Chriſtians ſhould do ſo many things, that raiſe up conſcience like a Lyon and Bear, to roar within them; when even Heathens have been afraid to make their conſcience their enemy and adverſary. If the fire hath ſo quickly burned the green tree, how will the dry tree indure? Oh think not theſe phraſes of Conſcience, and trouble for ſin, unquietneſs and terror in a mans breaſt, to be fictions and vain ſcare-Crows: No, men have had them, that have lived onely in a wilderneſs, that had no other Book to read then that of the Creature; they have feared a terrible juſt God, ready to be revenged on them whitherſoever they went: And doeſt thou lye, and ſteal, and commit whoredom, and thinkeſt not that God beholdeth thee, with a ſparkling eye, full of vengeance?</p>

                     <hi>ſparks, and have attained to admirable commendations, for many things done by them:</hi> They did not all of them detain the truth in unrighteouſneſs, but did admit of all the Culture and Tillage they could meet with, to perfect thoſe vertuous principles as they thought of. Hence ſome of them have thrown away all the wealth they had, that they might the better attend to Philoſophy; yea, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> would never diſpute about the Heavens or Stars, or other Sceptical matter, but wholly manners, how to rectifie them, and to make yong men leave: their vices; eſpecially we might give you inſtances of their great improvements in theſe things:</p>

They conclude, Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, were the onely walls and defence of a Kingdom. Some of them, devoted themſelves to preſent death, as the <hi>Decii</hi> and <hi>Curtii,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent judgements to the publique. Oh what a ſhame may many Heathens, upon record in Hiſtory, be to thoſe who ſtile themſelves Chriſtians!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>In Fidelity and Righteouſneſs,</hi> both of words and promiſes, and all <note place="margin">II. Fidelity.</note> their contracts. <hi>Romana fides</hi> was a proverb, becauſe they faithfully would do what they had promiſed; their words were as good as oathes. One priſoner, a captive, had given his word, that if he might go to diſpatch his buſineſs, and get ſome way or other to redeem himſelf, he would faithfully return again, in caſe he could not; and not being able to effect it, he returneth again to his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, though he knew he was to be put to all cruelty. <hi>Ariſtides</hi> was called the juſt, becauſe of his righteouſneſs and faithfulneſs in all his dealings. But of how many may we ſay, even that are called Chriſtians, in ſtead of Such an one the juſt, ſuch an one the falſe and unrighteous man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>In all moderation and ſobriety, abſtaining from thoſe things that were</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">III. Sobriety.</note> 
                     <hi>fit objects for their luſts. Alexander</hi> kept himſelf from <hi>Darius</hi> his Virgins, when he had conquered him by War: They were temperate in their dyets, avoiding occaſions of gluttony and drunkenneſs. The <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> would have their children ſee a drunken man, that beholding his madneſs and beaſtlineſs, they might take heed of it: And as for the paſſions of anger and malice, how lowly in refraining of them, patiently bearing all contumelies and reproaches! I would, ſaid an Heathen, to one who reviled on him, that this man could rule his tongue, as well as I can my ears. I would beat and puniſh thee, ſaid another to his ſervant, but that I am angry. Thus we might go even into the wilderneſs, and gather many ſweet flowers there: We might tell you of wiſe and ſage <hi>Apophthegmes,</hi> of vertuous and noble actions, and all this while they had no hopes of an Heaven, or Eternal Glory to incourage them. Many of them, after their noble Achievements for the publique, returned home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain without any wealth or advance, but onely glory; yea, and one or two of them contemned that alſo: But though they have done thus worthily, yet you muſt take heed of two errors, magnifying theſe their actions too high.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Some have thought,</hi> and that both of the ancients and latter ſort of <note place="margin">Cautions.</note> Writers, that many of theſe Heathens have been ſaved; that men who in their generation did thus wonderfully, could not be damned. Though theſe Teachers are divided among themſelves; ſome ſay, the Law of Nature ſaved them, as Chriſt doth Chriſtians, ſo that they ſay, they were ſaved without Chriſt: Others ſay, Chriſt was immediately and extraordinarily revealed to them: but neither of theſe opinions have any ground in Scripture, which attributes no ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation but unto Chriſt, and the calling upon his name, which they did not. <note place="margin">No ground in Scripture for Heathens Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The other Error</hi> is, that natural men by improving their naturals, are thereby diſpoſed and prepared for ſupernaturals; that a man by well uſing
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:30767:192"/>
of this natural light, God will give him ſupernatural light: But God hath made no ſuch promiſe in the Scripture, and the falſneſs of it is declared in this. That we never read yet of any Heathen, who upon the good improvement of thoſe natural abilities, had grace vouchſafed to him. I ſhall in the next place come to the Uſe of this point; And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Have Heathens without the Scripture, without the knowledge of <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> Chriſt and his Word, done many things righteouſly and ſoberly? Then what ſhame and reproach is it to Chriſtians, if any among them be found unjuſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and living in all intemperance? Yet is not the greater number of thoſe that profeſs the Chriſtian Religion, infected with ſome erroneous and groſs vices or other, which the Gentiles have abhorred? As Chriſt ſaid of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion a ſtranger, <hi>He had not ſeen ſuch faith in Iſrael;</hi> and truly, we may ſay, That there is not to be ſeen ſuch faithfulneſs in mens words, ſuch temperance in their lives, no not among many Chriſtians, as have been among many Gentiles. Who can plead for ſuch who deal unjuſtly, ſpeak falſely, over-reach in their contracts? when men without the true knowledge of a true God, have been afraid to do it. You could not among all the <hi>Lacedaemonians</hi> have ſeen one drunken man, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it was their ſlaves, their <hi>Helotae,</hi> as they called them; and now it is hard to finde a ſober, temperate man among many Proteſtants. Some of the Heathens have been ſo Religious about an oath, and fearful about ſwearing, that they never would uſe it upon any humane or earthly buſineſs; yet he is accounted a man now not of any ſpirit or gallantry, that doth not imbroider his Language with ſeveral Oathes. <hi>Baſil</hi> the Ancient, objected to Chriſtians in his time, that accuſtomed themſelves to ſwearing, the example of one <hi>Clinias</hi> a <hi>Pythagorean,</hi> who having a great fine laid upon him, to pay a great ſum of money, the which he might have eſcaped by taking an oath, yet he would not ſwear, but rather pay that money: Certainly, if God doth ſometime ſend his own people to the very irrational creatures to learn, to the Ox and Ant, no wonder, if they may ſometimes be taught by thoſe who have not ſuch means of holineſs as they have. Civility and Moral honeſty, theſe are to be found among the Pagans, and ſometimes we cannot finde it among Chriſtians; eſpecially the Heathens have condemned a man of a falſe heart, that will ſpeak one thing with his mouth, and intend another thing: <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I hate him even to hell, that ſaith one thing with his mouth, and thinketh another thing in his heart, ſaith he in <hi>Homer:</hi> They loved a candid and ſincere ſpirit, as he that wiſhed there was a glaſs in his breaſt, that all the world might ſee what was in his heart: But O the hypocriſie, double tongue, double heart that many baptiſed perſons have. Why do not ſuch leave Chriſts Sheepfold, and go rather into the Dens and Holes of ſubtil Foxes? And ſo for intemperate, diſſolute men, Why do not they forſake Chriſts Fold, and go to the Sty of Swine, wallowing there in all mire and filth? Now conſider how many horrid and grievous accuſations the committing of ſuch ſins is ſubject unto:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There is leſs excuſe and plea to be made for thee: Haply at the day of Judgement, Heathens will plead, Why? they did not believe in Chriſt; Why? they did not receive the Goſpel, that it never ſounded in their ears, there was no preaching to them; or if ſo, the matter was ſupernatural, ſuch as fleſh and blood could not cloſe with, there was no proportion between that glorious object and the faculty: But what can you ſay? who have and do live in ſuch ſins, which the very children of Pagans would condemn: Can you ſay, Lord we did not know that to ſpeak falſely, do unjuſtly, live intemperately, were ſins? We had none to tell us, that theſe were unlawful ways? No ſuch thing can be plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by you; O therefore be at laſt awakened from this ſecurity; remember you are men, and not beaſts; remember God hath placed a conſcience, to be a Judge in you: Oh do not ſuch things! thus all without thee, and all within thee will condemn.</p>

As there is leſs excuſe, ſo they are a greater reproach and ſcandal to that glorious Goſpel which we receive: What? ſhall not the Goſpel of Chriſt, and the word of God teach us more holineſs, then the Turks <hi>Alcoran?</hi> Shall not the ten Commandments of God, oblige us to more purity, then the twelve Tables of the Romans: O what a ſad diſhonor is this to the truth and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, that among his people, ſhall be found doers of thoſe things, which natural light would abhor. Such are indeed ſpots and blemiſhes in our Congregations; ſuch are foul and deformed Monſters: <hi>Let every one that nameth Chriſt, depart from iniquity.</hi> What do ſuch weeds among his flowers? ſuch wolfs among his ſheep? If thou wilt be drunk, be ſo in the night among Pagans, not in the day among Chriſtians. The Church of God is not a fit place to vent ſuch unnatural impieties in; With what zeal and holy violence ſhould we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade theſe things in your hearts? As long as there are any prophane men, any unjuſt men, any groſs impieties committed by you, which nature would for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid, we ſhall not ceaſe to call on heaven and earth to be witneſſes againſt you; nay, every ſtone in the wall, and the timber in your houſes, ſhall ſpeak againſt you: Why do ſuch unclean Lepers come near where any holy duty or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances are to be performed? As they call an Ague, <hi>Ludibrium medicorum,</hi> the reproach of Phyſitians, becauſe they know not how to cure it; So let not that obſtinate ſenſeleſs diſpoſition in groſs ſins, be any more <hi>Ludibrium Theologo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> that with all our vehement exhortations we cannot heal thee of.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Sins committed againſt natural conſcience, make the more noiſe and terror in a mans conſcience, we do the more difficulty obtain a pardon of them; you ſee in <hi>Cain,</hi> upon his murther; in <hi>Judas,</hi> upon betraying innocent blood; and in <hi>David, Deliver me from blood-guiltineſs, O God,</hi> Pſal. 51. Theſe are deep and ſore wounds, which will moleſt a long ſeaſon, and when healed, will yet leave a ſcar. O think not that merry paſtimes, and jolly company will eat out this dart, when once mortally and deadly ſhot in thy heart: ſins againſt ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral light, ſuch as unbelief, diffidence in the promiſe, make not ſuch an horrid noiſe and tumult in thy ſoul, as theſe do: None can ſtill the roaring of theſe waves but God alone.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is more ingratitude and rebellion in thee who doeſt thus, becauſe God hath vouchſafed greater light, given greater help and ſupport againſt theſe ſins, then the Nations of the world receive, inſomuch that thy condemnation will be far greater, then of thoſe who were brought up in Natures School onely.</p>
                  <p>Have Pagans and Heathens done admirable things? then what glorious and <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> commendable things ſhould Chriſtians do, let not them outreach us: As the Apoſtle reckons up a catalogue of worthy Saints, who by faith wrought great and holy things, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. ſo we may put in a ſcroul of the names of many Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, who without faith, and without the knowledge of God, have done ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable exploits within the ſphear of Nature: Be thou exhorted to waſh out thoſe black ſpots in thy life; Conſider that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil. 4. 8. Whatſoever things are pure, holy, righteous, of good report: If there be any vertue, any praiſe, think of theſe things.</hi> We are not now preſſing you to be like Angels in heaven, doing Gods will, but that you would not be outſtripped by Gentiles, which know not Gods will. If any man among you be found prophane, unjuſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate, let him cry out, <hi>I am unclean, I am unclean, what have I to do, to take Gods word in my mouth, and hate to be reformed?</hi>

                  <p>THis Text (as you heard) was fruitfull in bringing forth twins, two pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticall obſervations. The firſt, <hi>That God hath implanted in mens hearts na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſome principles about a God, and the approbation of what is good, and alſo the rejection of what is evil.,</hi> hath at large been handled. We come to the ſecond, which is, <hi>That all the worth and excellency which men by theſe naturall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, though improved to the utmoſt, can attain unto, is not grace.</hi> The Scripture re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring Regeneration, and a new Creation, doth ſtill intend a further, excellency than naturall honeſty, or naturall devotion can carry us unto; for as we told you, though men are here ſaid by nature to have Gods Law written in their hearts; yet that is far different from that gracious promiſe in <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> where God is ſaid to write his Law, and put his fear into their hearts, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. For that is a writing of the Law, after the naturall ſtonineſſe is taken away, and a tender fleſhly plyable heart given unto them; ſo that ſhould God write no more graciouſly in us, than what is at firſt naturally ingraven in us, it would argue no more that we had grace, than that the Devils and damned in hell have grace; for you muſt know theſe Dictates about God, and a Conſcience about evill, is ſo inſeparably ingraven in our hearts, that it is not taken out, no not from the damned in hell; but the great cauſe of all their torment and miſery is, becauſe that work of conſcience is ſo quick and ſenſible in them, that being the gnawing worm which never dyeth: ſo then how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the laſt day, you heard the Heathens deſcribed in their glory, and many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable things done by them; yet now you ſhall hear their glory ſtained, their Sun in an Eclipſe, many dead flies that doe wholly marre their Box of oyntments. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed as <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerveth, A man that reads what excellent things they have done, cannot but have a kind of pity of them, and a ſecret deſire that they might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which (no queſtion) were the grounds that made ſome poſitively aſſert their ſalvation; but in matters of Religion, not humane pity or affections, but divine Authority muſt be the ſtar to guide us, and where we are unable to find out the juſtice, or mercy of God, there yet to adore them, it being as impoſſible for us to comprehend the wiſe and deep things of God, as a worm to underſtand the councells, and wiſe purpoſes of men: Come we therefore to prove and illuſtrate our Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     <hi>What is all this Doctrine to us?</hi> What doth it concern us, to hear that Heathens may, or have done ſuch righteous things? Are we Pagans, and Gentiles?

                     </gap>eſt on him for ſalvation, we receive the Sacraments. Therefore this diſcourſe about naturall light, and naturall power, ſeemeth altogether impertinent to us; the leaſt dwarf in Chriſtianity being higher than the talleſt Giant in Heatheniſm: What do you tell us of nature, who live under grace?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To anſwer this, Firſt, it may be charitably and juſtly aſſerted, that there are many</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Anſw. 1</note> 
                     <hi>who have the titles of Chriſtians, that yet in knowledge and lives differ nothing at all from Heathens.</hi> They know no more than a very Pagan doth, and their lives are far worſe than many Gentiles. There are men among us that ſeldome or never fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Church-Aſſemblies, that if they be queſtioned about God, or Chriſt, or the Holy Ghoſt, can give no better account, than if they had lived among the Indians, onely they have heard of a Chriſt; but what he is, and to what purpoſe appointed by God, they know not the leaſt iota or tittle of it: Its not any knowledge or faith they have about the Chriſtian Religion, rather than any other in the World, but onely the Kingdome wherein they live, and the Authority under which they are, enjoyneth ſuch things to be received, with the example of other their neighbours, eſpecially the imitation of their parents, and this is all that moveth them to the owning of Chriſt. Certainly, the faithfull Miniſters of God, may, or ought to ſay, <hi>Rivers of water runne down our eyes, becauſe many underſtand not the very foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation and firſt principles of Religion.</hi> They are but mock-Chriſtians, they have a name and a badge of Chriſtianity upon them, but their ignorance and ſottiſhneſſe is ſo great, that it would make a man to be amazed at it. Do not therefore ſay, What is this to us? Oh it is too much to too many, who have ſcarce learned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be a Chriſt, or an holy Ghoſt, or no.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>This Diſcourſe is pertinent, becauſe though there may be many amongſt us, who have the knowledge of Chriſt, and underſtand the true Religion; yet they have not powerfull efficacy, or operation upon their hearts or lives.</hi> The Word of God doth not direct, correct, or mold their lives, they attend not to that, but what good they doe, or evill they avoid, is wholly from thoſe Reliques and remnants which God hath left in them. This is a chief point in Chriſtianity, to conſider, whether it be a naturall principle onely that carryeth thee to what is good, or a ſupernaturall; whether it be the Law written in us by God the Author of nature, or the Law written in us by God the Author of grace. The Apoſtle ſpeaketh of the acknowledgement of the truth after Godlineſſe, <hi>Titus</hi> 1. 1. the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of truths as they are in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Epheſians</hi> 4 and <hi>Coloſſians</hi> 1. 6. The knowing of the grace of God in truth. All which is, when men living under the Goſpel, are by the power of it ſo changed and altered, that whatever good they doe, or evill they avoid, they are in all inabled by a ſupernatural ſtrength vouchſafed unto them. Now it's too apparent, that moſt mens Religion, Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Converſations, are wholly built upon a naturall Devotion, and a naturall righteouſneſſe: they would have been ſuch devout men and ſo juſt men, if they had never heard of Chriſt; if they lived among the Heathens they would have been no better or worſe. I entreat you therefore to conſider what divine impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the Chriſtian Religion hath made upon you. Art thou any more in all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties thou doſt, than what thy mother-Piety, (as we ſay mother-wit) or thy mother-Righteouſneſſe inableth thee to. Thou worſhippeſt God and Chriſt with the ſame humane affections and devotions as the <hi>Romans</hi> their <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> their <hi>Diana,</hi> onely thou haſt the true object of worſhip, and they have not. When our Savior preached, that he was the true bread which came down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:30767:194"/>
preſently ſome hearers cryed out, <hi>Lord give us evermore of this bread,</hi> John 6. 34. Here were humane affections, and a naturall devotion; they did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, or graciouſly diſcern, what this <hi>bread of life</hi> was. It may be juſtly feared, that the Goſpel or Word of God hath little power over mens lives, onely an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, or naturall piety leads on men to doe what they doe; For if they were ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified and moulded by the word, then that would carry them to all Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, they would have a reſpect to every duty; beſides they would in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall and heavenly manner be affected, and in a conſtant perſevering manner: Whereas naturall Piety is ſeen only in ſome ſtraits and extraordinary difficulties; as the Heathens, who carried <hi>Jonas</hi> in their Ship, ſought all to their gods, when they were in extream danger by a violent tempeſt. Therefore neither Sun or Water is ſo neceſſary (as they ſay) as this truth is; for this will only teach thee the true Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtical difference between that which is humane and divine in thee. This will diſcover <hi>Sibboleth</hi> or <hi>Shibboleth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>We have juſt cauſe to preach of this even to Chriſtians, becauſe they are out-stripped in many things by the heathens.</hi> They obſerved their Idols and falſe Gods with more fear and care, than thou doſt the true. What a wonderfull ſpeech was that of <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> and <hi>Eugenius,</hi> who being very clement, and exceſſive in forgiving thoſe enemies that made warre againſt him, and being admoniſhed that this clemency of his would undoe him, and imbolden adverſaries the more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, we read this Anſwer, <hi>Nos non ſic colimus Deos, &amp;c. We doe not ſo ſerve or worſhip the gods, that our enemies ſhould overcome us.</hi> Alas, what Chriſtians may truely ſay ſo? How many times have the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> the ſavage and fierce na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world overcome the Church, and deſtroyed Chriſtians, becauſe they have ſerved God looſly and negligently, <hi>Vitis noſtris barbari fiunt fortes: Our wickedneſſe and ſinnes made the adverſaries ſtrong;</hi> ſo that here is great cauſe to hear theſe things with attention, knowing we have too much Heatheniſm in us, we have little of the Goſpel mould in us.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things laid down, we come to demonſtate that no naturall excellency de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be called grace; and for the more orderly proceeding; as the Apoſtle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videth <note place="margin">Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that no naturall excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency deſerveth to be called Grace.</note> the whole work of a man in reference to ſalvation, into theſe three parts, <hi>Tit. 2. To live righteouſly,</hi> in reſpect of others; <hi>ſoberly.</hi> in regard of our ſelves; and <hi>Godly,</hi> in reſpect of God, I ſhall firſt detect the inſufficiency of <hi>Naturall piety,</hi> then <hi>Naturall Honeſty,</hi> and laſtly, <hi>Naturall Sobriety</hi> and temperance: wherein we ſhall wholly reject that poſition of ſome, making a three-fold Piety, <hi>Judaica,</hi> of the Jewes, <hi>Ethnica,</hi> of the Heathens, and <hi>Chriſtiana,</hi> of the Chriſtians; for as <hi>Extra Eccleſiam non eſt ſalus;</hi> ſo it muſt needs follow, <hi>non eſt Pietas,</hi> without faith, it being impoſſible to pleaſe God, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 11. For their Piety and Devotion to God.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>How farre ſoever it may carry a man, yet it is accompanied with great blindneſſe, ignorance, and confuſion of mind; that whatſoever reverence, or affections</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">I. Natural Piety and Devotion not grace. For, 1. Its blinde.</note> 
                     <hi>they have towards God, yet ſuch a darkneſſe is upon a man, that he can doe nothing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth notably confirm this, by that Diſcourſe he had, when at <hi>Athens,</hi> Acts 17. 22. &amp;c. <hi>I found an Altar with this Inſcription, To the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known God: whom therefore ye ignorantly worſhip, him I declare unto you.</hi> They did ignorantly worſhip God, even thoſe <hi>Athenians,</hi> that were renowned for learning, and intellectuall abilities; and <hi>verſe 27. That they ſhould ſeek after the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and find him.</hi> Its a full expreſſion, to ſhew that all men naturally are like the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in a thick darkneſſe, that are forced to grope and feel with their hands, not knowing what to doe: and thus it is with every man, though a Chriſtian, if he order not his ſteps according to the ſupernaturall light of the Word; he doth but grope, and is in great confuſion about God, and Chriſt; not onely upon the Heathens Altars, but upon ſome Chriſtians ſolemn worſhip may be this Inſcription, To the unknown God. Thou prayeſt to an unknown Chriſt; it is an unknown Holy Ghoſt unto thee: Regeneration is an unknown pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge;
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:30767:194"/>
faith is an unknown Grace; ſo that this naturall light about a God, is ſo confuſed, ſo darkned, that thereby he cannot any wayes expedite himſelf, or direct his wayes to pleaſe God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>This naturall piety and devotion, is exceedingly ſtained and beblurred by carnall and vain imaginations,</hi> whereby they have been guilty of horrible and groſs <note place="margin">2.</note> Idolatry; ſo that their Piety hath been the greateſt abomination, and that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly wherein men naturally judge themſelves moſt holy and religious in ſerving of God, there they have moſt diſhonoured him. Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. ſheweth of the wiſe <hi>Grecians,</hi> that they became <hi>vain in their imaginations turning the glory of the incorruptible and immortall God into an image of an Ox that eateth hay.</hi> The <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that were moſt famous for knowledge and learning, were the moſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable in their religious worſhips; ſo that all the Idol worſhip in the world came from that confuſed darkneſſe in mens thoughts about a God. And the ſame corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted principle in Popery, yea, and in common Chriſtians, is ſtill moſt vigorous to have images and ſome corporall reſemblances of him we do worſhip. Thus we judge of God like a man, like our ſelves, and therefore attribute that to him, which we ſee is pleaſing to our fancies. Therefore know thou, that all that deſire which is in thee after a carnall and ſenſible worſhip of God by images and ſuch repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, is but Heatheniſm in thee: Such kind of worſhip was brought in at firſt from the cuſtome of the Heathens; and the beſt pretence the introducers had for it, was, that thereby they might win the Gentiles the more eaſily to them. Oh then think not, this Sermon belongs to thoſe who live in the remote places of the world, who worſhip the Sunne and Moon and Stars. No, it is very proper for many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us ſtill, who delight in, and love all outward pompous and ſenſible Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, whereby the Heathens were wont to worſhip their gods.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>This light and devotion men had in them by nature, was ſo farre from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>gracious, that none were ſo bitter and malicious againſt the pure and ſpirituall Worſhippers of God and Chriſt, as they were.</hi> Thus there are certain devout <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo called, <hi>yet they ſtirred up perſecution againſt Paul,</hi> Acts 13. 50. 17. 17. They were exceedingly affectionate and devout in their traditionall worſhip they had of God; and ſo none greater enemies to ſpirituall worſhip than they: So true is that of the Apoſtle; <hi>The wiſdome of the fleſh is enmity to God; and it is not, nor can be ſubject to him,</hi> Rom. 8. 7. No greater adverſary in the world to the pure worſhip of God, than a mans natural reaſon, and carnal apprehenſions, deſtitute of Scripture-directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; all the falſe &amp; ſuperſtitious worſhip which ever came into the Church (and ſhe was ſcarce ever free) did flow from this Fountain, a carnal and humane judgment, what was fit and orderly, what was pleaſing to God, and what was diſpleaſing. <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerved this long agoe; and certainly, the ſimplicity, and pure ſpirituall worſhip of God is very offenſive and troubleſome to carnal apprehenſions. When therefore thou art to judge, what is the beſt worſhip pleaſing to God, and wherein he doth moſt delight, doe not conſult with thy own Methinks, or what Cuſtome and Education hath ingaged thee too, but to what the Scripture informs therein. The manner of Gods worſhip in publick we ſee, hath become the matter of ſad contentions for a long while. The Proteſtants calling that Reformation which the Papiſts abhorred, as deformation. Now certainly, if men would, as <hi>Conſtantine</hi> did in the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> cauſe the Bible to be the judge of the Controverſies, and not to goe beyond, or on this ſide that direction, laying aſide all carnall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices and ſuggeſtions, &amp;c. the ſpirituall worſhip of God would be readily imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. <hi>Auſtin</hi> admired <hi>Socrates</hi> his Speech, that God muſt be worſhipped onely that way, which he hath appointed. Oh therefore labour to ſubdue that remnant of Heatheniſm in thee, which is to adore God and worſhip him by carnal imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, light of reaſon, and not ſupernatural Revelation of Gods will: for ſtill we ſee how bitter naturall devotion is to true piety: none ſo cruel and bloudy as they who are carryed out againſt the true worſhippers of God: witneſſe the Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an party, who like Wolves have accounted the Sheeps bloud ſweeteſt.</p>

Fourthly, <hi>Although naturall light hath attributed unto God, a Government in this world, puniſhing the wicked, and abſolving the righteous, yet they have done this</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>with many doubtings, and much weakneſſe, often ſpeaking of Fortune and Chance, which they thought moderated every thing in the world.</hi> That God hath a revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eye upon ſinners, ſee how the <hi>Barbarians</hi> did acknowledge, <hi>Acts</hi> 28. For when <hi>Paul</hi> had a Viper faſtned on his hand, they concluded after this manner, <hi>No doubt this man is a murderer, whom though he hath eſcaped the Sea, yet vengeance ſuffers not to live.</hi> And ſo <hi>Jonas</hi> Mariners, when they were in extream danger of Shipwrack, they thought it was, becauſe ſome hainous Offender was among them, with whom God was angry. Thus it was implanted in them, that there was a God who did behold and take notice of wicked men, and would accordingly bring them to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Though they were thus at ſometimes, yet at other times they ſpake much of a goddeſſe Fortune, to whom they gave the reins of the government of the World; and therefore the Emperors had a golden Ball, which was Fortune, that was kept ſucceſſively, as if the keeping of that would preſerve their Empire: and they ſacrificed to <hi>Fortunae Viſcoſae,</hi> Fortune Bird-limed, that ſhe might not leave them, but make them always proſperous. Now this corrupt opinion, that Chance ordered all things, could not but ſtrike out all true fear of God, and obedience to him.</p>

But becauſe the next thing I ſhall ſpeak of, is, their morall vertues, a ſtep higher than thoſe naturall Dictates remaining in us, and am there to ſhew their inſufficiency, I ſhall deſiſt, and come to the Uſe, which is of Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, If thou liveſt in prophaneneſs, in unjuſt and unrighteous ways, here thou art worſe then an Heathen, they will riſe up and condemn thee; neither will the priviledge of Baptiſm or the title of Chriſtianity be a protection to thee, from that wrath which is due to thy enormous ways.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Our Savior ſpeaks of ſome Heathens, that if the Goſpel were preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, they would be more affected, and teſtifie better ſigns of their love of it, and reverence to it, then thoſe who enjoy the means of Grace: <hi>If the things had been done in Tyre and Sidon,</hi> ſaith our Savior, which were Heatheniſh places, <hi>they would have repented long ago in ſackcloth and aſhes,</hi> Mat. 11. 10.

                  <p>I Shall at this time finiſh the matter I intended out of this Text, which was to ſhew, <hi>That all the Moral excellency and worth, a man by nature can attain unto, deſerveth not to be called Grace and Godlineſs.</hi> The onely thing conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, that remaineth to be diſcuſſed, is, <hi>Whether thoſe Moral Vertues, the choiceſt Heathens are ſo exact in deſcribing of, and preſſing to, are Grace:</hi> For there is nothing ſeemeth to be ſo like godlineſs, as thoſe Moral Vertues, Fortitude, Temperance, Juſtice, Liberality, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ſeeing the Scripture commands the ſame things, that thoſe Authors do ſo commend, it may juſtly be doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have thoſe Moral Vertues that do ſo excellently civilize a man, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regulate all his actions, that the Church and Commonwealth where he liveth, receiveth much good by him, be not enough to Salvation. This is a point of great concernment, for who doth not think, if he attain to ſuch a well-temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life, that he is in the neceſſary way to ſalvation? For the better diſcovery of the truth in this point, conſider theſe things:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That the Heathens were right in this, in commending Moral Philoſophy above all other Arts, becauſe the end of it was to make men civilly good, and

orderly to govern their actions: Therefore <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaid well, The other Arts are called <hi>Liberal,</hi> becauſe they are worth the ſtudy of a free and ingenuous man; but this is called <hi>Liberal,</hi> becauſe it makes a man free, and ſets him at liberty from his paſſions and vices. All the Sciences lie in Contemplation and Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but this endeavoreth to bring a man to the injoyment of ſome good, which is his end. The former were onely invented <hi>Ut. Exercitia ingenii,</hi> not <hi>Remedia animi,</hi> but this to be a medicine and cure of the ſoul. Hence when they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared all the Arts together, ſometimes they reſembled them to a field; Natural Philoſophy they made the plants and roots that grew therein; Logick the hedge that incloſed the field; but Moral Vertue was the fruit growing thereon: At other times they compared them to an Egg; the yolk or ſubſtance, was Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Philoſophy; the ſhell was Logick. Thus far they did well, that they thought it more excellent to reform a mans manners, to better his converſation, then to know the Motions of the Heavens, or to diſpute ſubtilly: Therefore they called it the muſick of the ſoul, as that which did tame and quiet mens unruly paſſions, and regulate their crooked lives; and herein they will certainly at the day of judgement condemn many Chriſtians, who labor more for knowledge, and how to get skill and underſtanding in thoſe matters which have applauſe in the world, then to live ſoberly and righteouſly.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Howſoever <hi>Plato</hi> and other Heathens, have labored much in laying down Doctrines and Precepts to cure mens lives, yet <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> hath the more general approbation, for deſcribing of Ethical Doctrine; Indeed <hi>Plato</hi> hath more Divine matter in his works, but <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> methodizeth it; therefore one ſaid, That all things lay confuſed, till <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> came, who put them unto order. As the great Army of the <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>des</hi> was confuſed and tumultuous, till <hi>Cyoxares</hi> their General regulated them. Yet the Fathers, they generally were moſt addicted to <hi>Plato,</hi> from whom alſo they ſucked in ſome corrupt opinions, which their Chriſtianity did not quite waſh away; and becauſe of their former life and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, it is an uſual thing with them to call the Chriſtian Doctrine, and the Chriſtian Religion, Philoſophy: But afterwards <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> began to be admired, whom <hi>Averroes</hi> called the Rule and Example, which Nature had found out, to demonſtrate the ultimate perfection of a man; yea, ſome Popiſh Writers have thought him a glorified Saint in Heaven: But whatſoever excellent Doctrine he might propound to make men civil, and externally vertuous, yet the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion doth reveal a far more excellent and noble way; and therefore if we take <hi>Solomons</hi> Proverbs, which we may call <hi>Solomons</hi> Ethicks; how infinitely doth he tranſcend <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> for though both may preſcribe the ſame Moral duty, yet <hi>Solomon</hi> ſtill carrieth us out to God, and ſets up a ſure light to direct our feet in a good and upright way.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That which we call <hi>Ethicks,</hi> or moral Philoſophy, is a doctrine informing us how to regulate our actions, according to honeſty and righteouſneſs, that ſo we might be happy: For although Heathens miſerably erred, and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, about what happineſs was, and the chiefeſt good, yet they all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, there was ſuch a thing, and that the way thereunto was onely by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous actions: The nature of which they deſcribed to be in keeping of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Mean, ſo that a man do not fail in exceſs or defect; and all this was to be done for vertues ſake, out of love to it; as for example, they made Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance a vertue, but when and how? even when a man had got an habit of this ſobriety rooted in him; not exceſſive in any things of pleaſure, nor yet defective in things convenient and neceſſary; and all this he doth not for applauſe ſake, or to preſerve his health, but out of a love to vertue: This therefore they preſs, that he who would be happy, he muſt be a vertuous man; and certainly, this may ſeem an high point, that they held none vertuous, but ſuch who did vertuous actions, for vertues ſake: This laid down, it will be very profitable to know whether this be not Grace: whether any men need to do any more: would it
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:30767:198"/>
not be well, if many amongſt us were thus far moralized? The anſwer is nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, All ſuch vertues, let men attain to never ſo much lovelineſs and come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in them, yet are not the Grace God requireth of thoſe who would be ſaved: Their Temperance, their Meekneſs, their Juſtice, is far different from that Temperance, Meekneſs and Righteouſneſs, which the ſpirit of God works in us; therefore there are ſome Divines that ſay, The Scripture never uſeth ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in that ſenſe, as the Philoſophers do; neither (ſay they) is Grace ever cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led vertue: But I cannot ſay this latter is true, for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>A ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous woman,</hi> Prov. 30. 10. that is, A gracious godly woman; and the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the chain of Graces, ſaith, <hi>Adde to faith, vertue; and to vertue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 5. It is true, to deliver ſuch matter as this, as to love a good and honeſt action for honeſties ſake, ſeemeth to be very high, and we may juſtly queſtion, whether ever any Heathen was ſo vertuous in that reſpect; they were onely notions, delivered by men in Books, not realities practiſed in mens lives; but grant all this were ſo, and we have many men amongſt us, who are admirably moralized, prudence and reaſon hath wonderfully civilized them, that they abhor any groſs ſins, as that which is againſt the nature of a man, and makes him become bruitiſh; but yet none of theſe are yet in a ſtate of Grace. And conſider well the grounds of this point, that at laſt thou mayeſt be provoked to true godlineſs:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>This civilized Vertue falls ſhort, becauſe it hath not been built upon a ſure, deep and humble foundation;</hi> which is, the acknowledgement of our natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption <note place="margin">1. Natural ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, with other natural habits, not Grace.</note> and the horrible ſtain that is now throughout the whole man: They were alſo ignorant of the ſinfulneſs of thoſe inward motions, and firſt ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſin, which <hi>Paul</hi> doth ſo bemoan and bewail himſelf for, as a miſerable captive. Now if a man build never ſo fair an Edifice, upon a ſlighty and weak foundation, when any ſtorm ariſeth, all will fall preſently to the ground. All men indeed, have acknowledged vertue hard and difficult to fleſh and blood, they placed it upon an high hill, to which it was hard climbing, but yet they did not make it impoſſible to fleſh and blood. Some of the Heathens conceived, the ſeeds and foundations of vertue were in our nature, as ſparks of fire are in a flint ſtone, which are ſtricken out, though with an hard blow; but man is ſaid <hi>To be dead,</hi> not aſleep in ſin, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. and our Regeneration is called a Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, not an awakning from evil ways. Grace is not ſowed in an heart, as ſeed in the ground, which the earth brings forth by a natural power, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred ſtrength; but as <hi>Sarah</hi> did conceive, wholly by the power of God: Thus doth the heart of a man bring forth the fruits of righteouſneſs. Here then is the certain ground of mens miſtakes, they lay not a ſure foundation at firſt; they think not ſin hath made ſuch a deep and inward wound upon a mans ſoul, and therefore they ſeek not out for ſuch a deep and inward cure: Oh know then! that although thy life be never ſo externally vertuous, yet if thou haſt not begun with this principle of Debaſement, all the work of grace is to begin a new in thee.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>This Moral Vertue is not Godlineſs, becauſe they erred in the maner</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>alſo of obtaining it:</hi> They looked upon vertue, as that which was acquired by their own induſtry and cuſtomary actions; they call them acquired habits, not infuſed: They thought by often actions of Temperance, Meekneſs and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, to get the habits of them; but in Chriſtianity it is far otherwiſe, God firſt makes the tree good, then the fruit will be good: Firſt he infuſeth into our ſouls ſupernatural principles, inabling us to walk holily, and then we walk in his Commandments; this is called, <hi>The taking away of an heart of ſtone, and giving an heart of fleſh,</hi> Ezek. 32. and <hi>Writing his Law in our hearts,</hi> Jer. 31. ſo that when we are righteous, temperate, in a Chriſtian way, it is not becauſe we often accuſtomed our ſelves to ſuch actions before, but becauſe God firſt ſanctified our natures thereunto; whereas all Moral Vertue is obtained by a ſtudious and

diligent exerciſe of our ſelves in ſuch ways; therefore they called this Art or Doctrine, <hi>Ethicks,</hi> from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, Cuſtom, becauſe they did frequently uſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſuch maners; And how common is this amongſt us? Have men been formerly given to ſuch and ſuch vicious and ſinful courſes? if they recover out of theſe, they do it by an humane power, they ſtint themſelves in ſuch and ſuch a maner: All this is well done, but ſtill they muſt look higher, they muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect and beg for grace, to be infuſed in their hearts by Gods ſpirit, not obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their own labors: Therefore men thus moralized, and no more, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver zealouſly affected with the Grace of God converting them; they never are admiring, as you ſee <hi>Paul</hi> is, ſometimes to raviſhment, of the riches of Gods grace, and his unſpeakable love to them: Nor have they ſuch diſcovery of Grace in them, as to be often ſpeaking of, and affected with the original of it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>This Moral Vertue is therefore inſufficient, becauſe it is not guided by a ſure and ſtanding rule, which is the word of God:</hi> For ſeeing that is true, which is affirmed <note place="margin">2.</note> by them, That vertue is in a golden Mediocrity, moderating againſt exceſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; there muſt be ſome ſtandard or immoveable rule to go by, that we erre neither on the right hand or the left. Now that which they preſcribed, was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the dictate and reſolution of a prudent man; <hi>Sicut vir prudens judicabit,</hi> As a prudent man ſhall judge: But alas? no man can be a rule to a vertue, but ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue muſt regulate him: This were to have the Sun follow the Clock, as they ſay; therefore theſe did onely grope in the dark, not knowing how to order their ſteps; they were like ſhips in the ſea, without any Pilot. But to that which is truly grace and godlineſs, the word of God is a ſure rule; that onely regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateth our actions, that informeth us how to moderate our paſſions, how to bound and limit our affections; as alſo, what motives and attractives ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large our deſires to what is good: Therefore the Word of God is ſo often called a <hi>Light</hi> and a <hi>Lamp,</hi> Pſal. 119. and the Apoſtle calls it the <hi>Rule,</hi> Gal. 6. 16. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which we muſt direct and order our ſteps: That is not grace, which the thoughts of a wiſe man ſhall determine, but what Chriſt and the Word of God ſhall conclude; and indeed, hence ariſe all miſtakes about God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, that the Scripture is not made the Judge of it. That which to our apprehenſions, to our prudential thoughts, we think to be right and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, that preſently we imbrace, and go no further: But the nature of true godlineſs, is as much above thy thoughts, and beyond thy expectation, as any myſtery of Faith. A man would as hardly believe, that Grace is ſuch a ſupernatural myſterious work, as the Doctrine of the Trinity, or Chriſts Incarnation is incredible to a Natural man: Look therefore to have true Grace, a farre other thing, then thy Natural Prudence would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>This Moral Vertue is not Grace, becauſe ſuppoſe the utmoſt and higheſt which they attained in this way,</hi> viz. <hi>To love a vertuous action, for vertues</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>ſake, not for vain glory, or ſelf-ends, but meerly becauſe vertue is lovely, and comely, and conſonant to right reaſon:</hi> Yet becauſe they ſtaid in this, and did not refer all to God, placed their truſt and happineſs in this, and not in God; therefore theſe Vertues were indeed Vices. Hence the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 6. 1. calls all their Magiſtrates and Governors in their Publique Courts, unjuſt: <hi>Do any of you go to Law before the unjuſt, and not before the Saints:</hi> Though they had a Civil Juſtice, and were a terror to the wicked; yet becauſe this was not referred to Gods glory, the Scripture calls them <hi>unjuſt.</hi> But you ſee, the godly who have true Grace in them, and the fruits of Gods Spirit, yet reſt not in this, look not to be juſtified or made hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py hereby, but go out of them all to the favor of God through Chriſt: Thus <hi>Paul accounteth his Righteouſneſs dung and droſs, in compariſon of the Righteouſneſs by Faith,</hi> Philip. 3. 8. <hi>Paul,</hi> furniſhed with ſo many gracious
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:30767:200"/>
abilities, yet as a meer Beggar, runs to Gods Grace for covering, leſt his nakedneſs appear: So that if our Graces, which yet are wrought in us by Gods Spirit, may have no confidence put in them; much leſs may thoſe Civil Vertues: And for this reaſon, <hi>Auſtin</hi> puts thoſe glorious Vertues in the Catalogue of Vices. Thoſe vertues, ſaith he, which a man ſeemeth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have, by which he hath power and dominion over vices, unleſs they be referred to God, they are vices rather then vertues; for although of ſome they are then thought to be true and honeſt vertues, when they are referred to themſelves, and not deſired for any thing elſe, yet even then they are ſwelling and proud, and therefore are not vertues but vices: For as that is not fleſh, but above fleſh, which makes fleſh live, ſo that is not of a man, but above man, which makes man to live happily: thus <hi>Auſtin.</hi> So then this Civil vertue can make none godly, becauſe it makes a man ſtay in himſelf, and reſt in thoſe apprehended perfections, not at all going out to God; whereas Grace in its proper effects, ſtill makes us to eye God, and look out to him.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>As a Conſectary from the former, therefore this Moral Vertue</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>is not godlineſs, becauſe it is not a life of faith, which yet is the ſoul and heart of all godlineſs. The juſt ſhall live by faith,</hi> Romans 1. 17. Now this life of faith is not onely in Juſtification, whereby we lay hold upon Chriſt for his Righteouſneſs, that ſo Chriſt may be all in all; but alſo in Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, whereby Chriſt dwelling in our hearts, we receive Power, Life and Motion from him, to walk in all godlineſs: Thus <hi>Romans 11. By faith we ſtand as branches in the Olive Tree, and receive of its fatneſs:</hi> The life of Grace in a godly man is not an entire independent and abſolute life of it ſelf, but a partial dependent one, ſuch as the branch is of a tree; or a member of the body; or the childes life in the womb. As therefore when the root is withered, the branches muſt; or as ſweet flowers, pulled off their root, preſently loſe their life and fragrancy; ſo doth a godly man, if he could be ſeparated from Chriſt: But civil vertue is not a life of faith, depending upon another; its a life of works, wherein we are a kinde of abſolute Lords, not fetching power from without us. Hence it is, that theſe moraliſts are never much in prayer, earneſt in ſupplications; they pleaſe themſelves with cuſtom and formality, and laſie devotions, not feeling the conſtant need of Chriſt, and the daily ſupply which they ſhould have from him; yea, they are wholly ſtrangers to the life of faith, they know not what it means; they have no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes or temptations in it: Therefore do not thou judge of thy good condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by thy Morality, by thy external Righteouſneſs, but by thy faith; Doſt thou know what it is to believe? to lie ſucking at the breaſts of Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe daily? to be drawing out of the wells of Salvation continually? This is the great part of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>This Moral life is not a gracious life, becauſe here is nothing of Chriſt in it;</hi> who yet inableth onely to what is godly, and makes that godlineſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable: <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>There is no other name to be ſaved by, but by Chriſt; and no other way, but by faith in that Name,</hi> Acts 4. 12. Therefore Chriſt calls himſelf <hi>The Way, the Truth and the Life,</hi> John 14. 6. <hi>The way,</hi> ſo that whatſoever glory and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity any action may have, yet if it be not through him, its out of the way; and the faſter a man runs, if it be out of the way, the greater loſs it is. Then he is the <hi>Truth,</hi> all actions not done in his name, are but lyes and vanities: Thy Religion is a lye, thy Righteonſneſs is a lye, if it be not done in and through him. And then he is the <hi>Life,</hi> let thy converſation be never ſo reſplendent, ſo glorious, yet it is but a dead glory; there is no ſupernatural life of grace, but where Chriſt is. Now a Moral man, if a Chriſtian, though he may in profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion acknowledge Chriſt, yet he doth not live as one that daily receiveth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence from him: Chriſt is not really in his thoughts, in his duties, in his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:30767:201"/>
he doth not pathetically and heartily, cry out, How vain are all theſe duties without Chriſt? How undone were I, if not for Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>This Moral Vertue is not a life of Grace, becauſe it is many times a dreadful oppoſer, and a curſed enemy to it.</hi> Thoſe Stoicks, which were the chiefeſt <note place="margin">7.</note> of Heathens, and had the ſublimeſt notions about vertue, That would not have a man love vertue, not for the ſweetneſs and delight it brings, they thought that too baſe, and an unworthy reſpect, but onely for vertues ſake; yet how deſperately did they ſet againſt <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 17. 18. like loves its like; and therefore if Moral vertue were grace, it would love, reſpect and honor it whereſoever it findes it: Thoſe onely ſhould be chief in our affections, who are in piety.</p>
                  <p>But you may ſay, <hi>What? is there no difference then to be made between a vicious man, and a civilized man; between theſe outwardvertuous actions, and groſs prophaneneſs?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Queſt.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes, very much; for Firſt, God hath commanded the prophane, groſs man to be caſt out of the Church Aſſemblies, till he be reformed: <hi>If one that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>is a brother, be a fornicator, drunkard, &amp;c. not to eat with ſuch an one; and caſt out from among you that wicked perſon,</hi> 1 Cor. 5. ſuch groſs ſinners are no more to be ſuffered in holy Aſſemblies, then Swine in your garden, then Toades in your diſhes, then dead Flies in a box of ointment; but a Chriſtian civilized, though not regenerated, hath no ſuch cenſure to be inflicted upon him; and although this Morality be no qualification for heaven, yet it keeps men from being ſpots and blemiſhes, reproaches and ſcandals to that holy name which is called upon by us: Therefore its great matter of praiſe and bleſſing of God, if theſe reſtraints are put upon men, and they do not like Swine wallow in all mire and filth.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Moral vertue is profitable both to others, and to themſelves alſo. <hi>To</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>others;</hi> Thus the Righteouſneſs, Fortitude, and other noble Qualifications a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Romans, were a great advantage to the publique, and while thoſe humane vertues flouriſhed, <hi>Rome</hi> was the Queen and Head of the world; but (as their own Authors obſerve) when that ſtrictneſs and juſtice was diſſolved, and in the room thereof Avarice, Pleaſures, and all corrupt adminiſtrations, then ſhe became ſo ſick, that ſhe could neither indure her diſeaſes, nor yet her remedies: And then they are profitable to thoſe that do them, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their condemnation will be leſſer, their puniſhments more mitigated; and partly becauſe God doth beſtow many outward temporal rewards upon them. <hi>Ahab</hi> for external humiliation, had the publique judgements of the Land removed for that ſeaſon; and induſtry, frugality and righteous dealings, have temporal bleſſings following them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> To inform how far they are off from all grace, and ſo all hopes of glory, who live in groſs and prophane ways: What? if ſuch Righteouſneſs doth not avail? ſhall thy unrighteouſneſs? If ſuch temperance and ſobriety? ſhall thy voluptuous and unclean courſes? If copper be not found to be gold? ſhall dung be thought to be gold? Therefore let ſuch be aſhamed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, and never open their mouthes with any confidence. But</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This ſheweth the excellency of the word of God, which diſcovers thoſe things as contemptible and unworthy, which among men are ſo admired: What is more amiable? then to ſee a man of a ſober, temperate, chaſt and juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation? yet the Scripture ſheweth a more excellent way; not that it takes theſe away, but lifts them up to an higher nature. It makes a man go further, and do thoſe things upon ſpiritual and ſupernatural grounds, which were done upon humane and inferior motives before.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE firſt words of the Text cauſe us to look back to the Verſes before it. The Apoſtle in the beginning of the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, reproveth a ſinfull and unwarrantable practice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of going to Law one with another. Not that it is abſolutely a ſinne to demand our right before a Magiſtrate; as the Anabaptiſts would inſet from hence; for then the Apoſtle would not have permitted them to uſe ſuch judicial deciſions among themſelvs, to which he directs them; but the grounds of this prohibition are, partly becauſe they impleaded one another before Heathen Magiſtrates; and ſo Chriſtianity was made a reproach; partly they wanted a preparation of mind to ſuffer wrong, rather than ſinfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt in inferior matters; partly becauſe they did wrong, and were full of injurious carriages, and that to their brethren: from which wickedneſſe he deterreth them by that thireatning; <hi>Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of heaven?</hi> and to confirm this the more, he layeth down a more generall propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, enumerating ſeverall kinds of ſinnes; and leaſt they ſhould think their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian

Be not deceived,</hi> and the beginning of this <hi>verſe 11. And ſuch were ſome of you.</hi> For the former, although it was as plain as the Sun-ſhine at Noon-day, that all who live in groſſe ſins ſhould be damned, yet there were <hi>Corinthians</hi> who deceived their own ſouls, thinking they might be ſaved, although they lived in all prophane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.

                     </gap> uſeth ſuch a Preface, <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 8. and <hi>Paul, Gal. 6. 7. James</hi> alſo 1. 16. when they are to ſpeak that thing, which unknown, or unobſerved, would bring a man much evill; and truely there cannot be a greater cauſe to prefix ſuch an Antidote than in this matter of the Text: For how notoriouſly univerſall is this contagious and infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Principle, that the profeſſion of the truth of Chriſt, and a generall formall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation upon his Name will bring a man to heaven, though his life be nothing but a preparation for hell. Learned men ſay, that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> taught this Doctrine, That a bare profeſſion of faith, without a reformation of mens lives, is enough to ſalvation: whether this be mens Doctrine, or opinion, I know not; to be ſure, its too much their practice; and it may juſtly be thought, as <hi>Austin</hi> did, that one main reaſon, why <hi>James</hi> doth ſo much prefer good works, and a godly life, informing that faith alone without theſe did not juſtifie was, becauſe ſome corrupted and perverted theſe places in <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, where he ſets up faith as the onely inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of juſtification.</p>
                  <p>Obſ. <hi>That men are very prone generally to deceive themſelves in this, that though</hi>

                     <hi>they live wickedly, yet they ſhall dye happily, and be ſaved gloriouſly.</hi> Though they have lived enemies and adverſaries to God, yet they think to have the Kingdome of glory, as children and heirs of God. O monſtrous folly and madneſſe to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine ſuch things! But what is more frequently acted in the whole world than this? Is not prophaneneſſe and impiety as common among us as dirt in the high-way, or weeds in Summer; yet which one of theſe men, that live in ſuch wayes, doth not promiſe himſelf heaven? So that if we could remove this pillar, that ſo many lean upon, I ſee no obſtruction, or impediment in their way to ſalvation. If our hearers were driven out of this refuge, and were convinced; this is but a deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and it will doe them no good, how many would come to us as they did to <hi>John Baptiſt, What ſhall we doe to be ſaved?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the further preſſing of this point, it is worth the conſideration What are thoſe cauſes that make men of great impieties thus fooliſhly perſwaded; and firſt, <hi>Non-attendance to the Scripture;</hi> not obſerving the threatnings and curſes ſo peremptorily delivered there againſt all ungodlineſs. Men judge of their ſalvation, <note place="margin">Why men of great impiety have ſtrong perſwaſions of their happy Condition. 1.</note> and have hopes according to the principles of the world, and humane perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: They think God like themſelves, as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. They do not go to be informed out of the Word, how it will be with them at the latter end. Oh know then, though thy own heart, and though all the men in the world ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit thee, yet that is nothing, as long as the Word bindeth thee faſt in thoſe chains of condemnation. Thou therefore that liveſt in all groſſe prophaneneſſe, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thy ſelf heaven and happineſſe, look into the Scripture and tremble, take the Bible and read, ſee if that doe not make it as impoſſible for thee a prophane man, abiding ſo without Repentance and Reformation, to be ſaved, as it is for fire to be without heat, or the Sun without light: Who would think, that thou who rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and heareſt ſo much every day, ſhould be thus deceived? <hi>Know ye not,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdome of heaven?</hi> Know ye not! Is there any ſuch a Babe, or an Infant in Chriſtianity that is not acquainted
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:30767:202"/>
with this? Come then and hear the Concluſion of all, let the Scripture at laſt put the period to thy vain hopes: unleſſe thou haſt a new Bible, or new Scriptures, there can be no incouragement; for this which we read to you, &amp; out of which we preach to you every day, makes it one main buſines thereof to perſwade the wicked it ſhall goe ill with him. Oh then ſay, Here is no hope for me ſuch a ſinner, here is no incouragement till I become another man. They are the bewitchings, and deceitfulneſſe of my own ignorant corrupt heart, that telleth me of other things.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Therefore are many deceived in this plain point; becauſe though they</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>acknowledge damnation in the general to ſinners, yet they never make particular appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to themſelves;</hi> they doe not ſay, This threatning, this curſe belongs to me. God gave the Commandements in the ſingular number, <hi>Thou ſhalt do no Murther, Thou ſhalt not commit Adultery;</hi> to teach every man to reflect upon himſelf, and ſay, Thou doſt thus; and thou doſt thus. The Prophet complaineth, <hi>No wicked</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 4. Lam. 3 40.</note> 
                     <hi>man ſaid, What have I done?</hi> Jer. 8. 6. Hence are thoſe commands, <hi>To com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune with our own hearts, and be ſtill, To ſearch and try our wayes.</hi> It would make a man wonder, and ſay, How can this be? A man will acknowledge a Drunkard cannot inherit the Kingdome of heaven, and yet that man will be drunk; and ſo of all other ſins. Now how came the general and the particular to be thus oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites? meerly becauſe men came not to particular conviction; they doe not make home-application; they ſay not, <hi>Is not this I Lord?</hi> Even godly men have been ſenſeleſſe of grievous ſinnes, as <hi>David</hi> of Murder and Adultery, till <hi>Nathan</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou art the man.</hi> Oh let thy Conſcience take <hi>Nathans</hi> language, and ſay, <hi>Thou art the man.</hi> The Scripture ſpeaks to me, the Miniſter preacheth to me, as if there were no other ſinne in the world: But this undoeth you, you goe on in foul and ungodly ways, not ſo much as thinking what you are, not minding you are ſuch and ſuch a ſinner. To reflect upon your own ſelvs is a peculiar effect of reaſon, beaſts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do it; and the more thou art ſenſible this way, the more reaſon thou haſt in thee. Be not then as the Swine that never reflects upon her ſelf; thinking I am a Swine, I love to wallow in the Mire, I am no Sheep. As that Beaſt can never have ſuch thoughts, ſo be not thou as brutiſh, never to conſider, How plain is my wickedneſſe? it cannot be hid from my eyes, I love not, or delight not in that which is good.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Therefore are men deceived, becauſe they repreſent Gods mercy and grace in ſuch an univerſal and unlimited way, that they bound it not to faith and repentance,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>and a godly life.</hi> God indeed is an Ocean of mercy, an inexhauſted Fountain of all grace and goodneſſe. When we have thought the higheſt we can, yet ſtil there is more mercy in him than we can comprehend: but to whom is all this? who may plead this, and claim this in prayer? Even the humble, the broken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart. <hi>David</hi> may well cry out, <hi>Have mercy according to the multitude of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> Pſal. 51. 1. becauſe his heart is wounded, and bones are broken through Gods diſpleaſure at ſinne. If therefore thou wilt comfort thy ſelf with Gods mercy, and with his grace, be ſuch a qualified Subject as that requireth, lye like that man of <hi>Jericho,</hi> not onely half dead, but half damned in thy own ſenſe, and then the good <hi>Samaritane</hi> will poure Oyl into thy wounds. Doth God any where proclaim pardon and forgiveneſs to the unhumbled ſinner? Doth Chriſt ſay, Come to me ye jolly and merry ſinners, who never felt ſinne a burden. No, but all the mercy he ſpeaks, it is to thoſe, who being burdened with ſinne, deſire nothing more than to throw away that load. Do not then as the Bee is ſometimes drowned in Honey, ſo thou drown thy ſelf in the ſweet apprehenſions of Gods mercies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Gods wayes. As a Beaſt might not touch the Mountain, ſo neither may a foul wretched ſinner come near the promiſe to lay hold on it. Why might not the Divels and damned in hell comfort themſelves with this, That God is merciful, he is full of pity, and therefore will not let us lye alwayes roaring in theſe eternall flames? Oh you would ſay, this would be a vain mad thing, becauſe God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:30767:203"/>
otherwiſe, And is it not thus alſo in our caſe? God is mercifull, but he hath decreed otherwiſe, then that thou who loveſt and liveſt in ſinnes, ſhouldſt ever be refreſhed with this mercy. The damned in hell may have it as ſoon as thou wilfully abiding in thy wickedneſſe; onely God may give thee Repentance, and ſo fit thee for mercy, which he will not doe for Divels.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>That wherein they wilfully deceive themſelves, is alſo about Chriſt, the Mediator and Saviour.</hi> This they build upon; Chriſt came to ſave ſinners, he is a <note place="margin">4.</note> Mediator to make up our peace. Now they make no queſtion, but this being true, they are ſure to be ſaved: Thus they build upon a good foundation, hay and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; for Chriſt is not a Saviour to any, but thoſe who receive him alſo as a Lord and a King, and ſo proffer ſubjection to all his lawes: He is not onely a Jeſus, a Saviour, but he is alſo a Lord and a King, and he never communicates his benefits, where he doth not beſtow his graces. It's true he came to ſave ſinners, he dyed for this end, but he alſo dyed to ranſome us from our luſts, and to make us a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple zealous of good works, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. 14. The grace of God (which is that of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in Chriſt) hath appeared, teaching us to deny all ungodlineſſe: So then as Chriſts body was not laid any where but in a new Sepulcher, whereno man elſe lay; ſo Chriſt the Mediator is not received into every mans heart, but where no luſt, or other groſſe ſinne is ſuffered to abide: If Chriſt be a Saviour to thee from hell hereafter, he is alſo a Saviour from preſent luſts and tranſgreſſions; and indeed this is the greateſt ſalvation of all, by how much the evill of ſinne is above the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill of the greateſt puniſhment. Therefore the truly godly, and ſuch as indeed have propriety in Chriſt, they look upon this as the principall and chief end of our redemption by Chriſt, to have our active evils ſubdued, rather than our paſſive. They thank God for ſending Chriſt into the world, to take away proud hearts, earthly hearts, diſobedient lives. In this they rejoyce, that there is vertue and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy in Chriſts death, to kill thoſe burdenſome luſts and ſinnes which they lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Know therefore, that if Chriſt purpoſe to doe you any good hereafter, he will do ſome to thee in this life. It's as great a mercy, and thou needeſt it as much, that he ſhould deliver thee from thoſe preſent evill wayes thou walkeſt in, as if thou wert in hell flames to be ſaved from them: And never did <hi>Dives</hi> more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately deſire a drop of Water in Hell to cool his ſcorched Tongue, than thou oughteſt for the preſent to deſire the bloud of Chriſt, and the Spirit of God, which is like Water, to extinguiſh that immoderate thirſt and deſire after ſinne.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Men doe ſo eaſily deceive themſelves, becauſe they put too much worth and efficacy in the Sacraments, and externall profeſſion of the true Religion.</hi> In being a <note place="margin">5.</note> Proteſtant, in participation of the Sacraments, they think there is ſo much piety and Religion, that though their lives be foul and noyſome, yet they hope for ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. This was a great deluſion of old in the <hi>Jewes;</hi> what controverſies had the Prophets, and expoſtulations with them in this matter! The <hi>Jewes</hi> they pretended their new Moons, their Sabbaths, their Sacrifices, and would not be driven from this refuge: But ſay the Prophets, <hi>W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſh ye, make ye clean, Iſaiah 1. execute judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and juſtice, let every wicked man forſake his evill way.</hi> Otherwiſe the Prophet declareth, that God hatteh their ſolemn Aſſemblies. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> would not have uſed ſo many Arguments to prove that faith without the godly effects of it could not juſtifie, if ſo be men had not been too prone to ſuck in this Principle; and as I told you not long ſince, This Opinion was ſo generally and univerſally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>(viz.</hi> That if a man did believe Orthodoxly, though he lived wickedly) in <hi>Auſtins</hi> time, That he did with fear and modeſty oppoſe it. But obſerve our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours ground of his refuſall of all thoſe who enjoy many priviledges, yet live ungodly; <hi>Depart from me ye workers of iniquity,</hi> Mat. 7. Becauſe they were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of iniquity, therefore God rejects them. Hence the Scripture complains of thoſe, who have the form and profeſſions of the faith of Chriſt, but in works they deny him, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 16. Thou abhorreſt the <hi>Socinian</hi> and other Hereticks, becauſe by
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:30767:203"/>
their opinions they deny Chriſt to be God; but thou by thy ungodly actions doſt alſo deny his God-head. Thou abhorreſt the Atheiſt, who ſaith, <hi>There is no God:</hi> yet all the wickedneſſe thou committeſt doth really ſay, <hi>There is no God:</hi> Therefore what doe we regard thy words, and thy Sacraments, or thy profeſſion, when we ſee thy deeds? Make thy life clean, waſh thy foul converſation, and then make thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious approaches to God. <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) the Lord will not hear my prayer.</hi> The cry of thy ſinnes will be above the cry of thy prayers; know then, as every tree is tryed by its fruit, ſo thy actions diſcern what thou art. Make never ſo many zealous prayers, come never ſo frequently to Church, yet if in the week day God findes Oathes, Drunkenneſſe, Prophaneneſſe in thy life; this is a reall denying of him.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, <hi>Therefore they delude themſelves in this weighty buſineſſe, becauſe they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>not the nature of faith and trusting in God.</hi> Come unto the vileſt of men, when deaths ſtroak is upon them, when the fear of that ſurrounds them, even then though full of their ſinnes, yet will ſay, They truſt in Chriſt Jeſus, they believe in him. But oh thou ignorant man; what is it to believe, and to truſt in him? Is it not out of the ſenſe of the bitterneſs of ſin, and a deliberate forſaking of it, obedientially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning up our ſelves to Chriſts commands, and therewith relying on Chriſt the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, is not this to believe? Doth not the ſame faith, which with one hand recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Chriſt, with another purifie the ſoul, and carry it out to all the fruits of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: preſumption indeed that is eaſie; to lay hold upon Chriſt for pardon, with an hand ful of wickedneſs this is ordinary: but to truſt in him according to Scripture direction, and that order which God hath inviolably preſcribed men, that is rare. Faith therefore is the gift of God, and it is wrought by his Spirit in us; we can no more cloſe with Chriſt, in a true Scripture-manner, as a Saviour, or the Promiſes revealed by God, than we can joyn with him as a Law-giver, or obey his Precepts. If therefore thou underſtoodſt the Nature of truſting in God, and what it is to believe, thou wouldſt not ſo eaſily perſwade thy ſelf thou doſt truſt in him, when thy Conſcience tells thee of thy manifold ſinnes. Hence the godly have found it ſo difficult to believe: they have been almoſt over-whelmed with doubts and fears; though Chriſt hath held out the Scepter of grace to them, yet they have even fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through fear and ſhame, when they came into his preſence. How frequently doth <hi>David</hi> call upon his ſoul, <hi>to truſt in God, and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Chriſtian faith and unchristian practiſes can ſtand together, how your Religion and your converſation can accord:</hi> The one is Honey, the other is Gall, the one is Light, the other is Darkneſſe. How is it poſſible you ſhould fall into ſuch palpable and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd contradictions. O deceive not your ſelves any longer, think not it will be well as long as thoſe ſins are unrepented, and unreformed. Be not deceived, ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to all ſuch, when you have to doe with men; if they profeſſe much kindneſſe and obſervance of you, yet in all their actions they work you all the deſpight and miſchief they can. Doe ye not call them Hypocrites, and ſay, <hi>Quid verba? What are words;</hi> when I ſee your deeds to the contrary? Doth not God from heaven ſay the ſame things to you; To what purpoſe is your hearing, and praying, your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of love to me, when all your deeds ſavor of hatred and rebellion againſt me? Now to quicken thee againſt this ſelf deluſion and ſelf deſtruction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That God will not be mocked;</hi> for ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Be not deceived, God will not be mocked,</hi> Gal. 6. 7. All thy Religion, all thy holy duties, without a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of thy life, is but a meer mockery of God; for what can be a greater mockery than this, to cry out of thy ſinnes here, and to commit them when thou comeſt home? To ſay here, Lord ſet thy will be done, even as Angels in heaven do it, and then at home to obey it no more than Devils in Hell, Oh conſider, this is
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:30767:204"/>
mocking of God, and of this ſinne thou haſt been guilty many years. Was not that plain mockery of Chriſt, when they called him King in ſcorn, and yet at the ſame time crucified him. No leſſe is it here, when thou draweſt nigh to God, as if thou worſhippedſt him, as if thou wouldſt love and obey him, and afterwards live to his great diſhonour.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Conſider, that what a man doth in his actions, is in ſome ſenſe a more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all demonſtration of a man then any words or profeſſions.</hi> He is the greateſt and moſt reall enemy to God, whoſe life is ſo, let his outward profeſſion be what it can be. Therefore God at the great day of judgement will proceed according to the works of men. The Lord heretofore complained of thoſe <hi>that drawed nigh to him with their lips,</hi> Iſa. 29. 13. <hi>but their hearts were far from him;</hi> and that did appear by their lives. Doſt thou think the words of prayer will help thee, when the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſinne are ready to damn thee? Wherein can you more really ſhew what you are, than by your conſtant life and converſation? O more blind than Moles or Bats, that ſee not themſelves for the preſent the fire-brands of Hell. What can hide this from thy Conſcience? Is it not too plain, that thy life is the fruit, thy duties are but leaves and bloſſoms. Doth not the Husbandman cut down that tree for burning which beareth not fruit, though many leaves.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>As it is mockery of God, ſo its plain, groſſe, and palpable hypocriſie.</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane men are apt to cenſure thoſe who live more ſtrictly, and accurately than themſelves as Hypocrites, not conſidering in the mean while, that heaven and earth cannot but take notice of their Hypocriſie: for what is more palpable than this, in thy words and Chriſtian Religion to acknowledge Chriſt a Lord and King, but in all thy actions to rebell againſt him: On the Sabbath day to come and outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be wail thy ſins; and the very next day, or hour, to commit thoſe very ſinnes again. How can you ſo ſoon forget what you were about? How is it that you ſo quickly croſſe your prayers and holy duties? May not Heathens and Pagans deride you, when they ſee your ungodly lives? May not they ſay, Loe, there is a Chriſtian who worſhippeth Chriſt, that commands him not to ſwear, but he will doe it all the day long? loe, there is a Chriſtian, whom Chriſt commands, that their hearts ſhould not be over-charged with Drunkenneſſe and the cares of this world, but they will do the clean contrary: What do you think God hath forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten your Religious approaches and ingagements, becauſe you have forgotten them?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Remember thou canſt not alwayes live in this fools paradiſe.</hi> Thou canſt not alwayes be in this fond dream of happineſſe and felicity; but God at laſt will bring thee to the touch-ſtone, and thy reward ſhall be according as thou art. Thus he that doth wickedly may for a while account himſelf happy; yet this will quickly melt, when death comes, when the day of judgement comes, then it will be fully diſcovered, that thoſe ſinnes and heaven can no more ſtand together, than light and darkneſſe. Then God will tell you, <hi>Depart you workers of iniquity;</hi> there is a great gulf between mercy and you. Oh then reflect upon thy ſelf and ſay, Why doe I all this? I live thus againſt Gods Law, and yet pleaſe my ſelf with thoughts of peace and happineſſe, how can it be? you muſt have another way to heaven, then ever the Bible hath yet diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>Uſe a.<note n="d" place="margin">Uſe 2.</note>  of Inſtruction, <hi>That nothing in all the Chriſtian Religion, if duely conſidered, doth at all incourage to any ſinne.</hi> If any thing might imbolden a man, it might be thought the mercy and goodneſſe of God, the freeneſſe and fulneſſe of Grace: but as for the former, <hi>There is forgiveneſſe with thee, that thou maiſt be feared,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130. 4. and as for the latter, with what holy indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation doth the Apoſtle argue againſt thoſe that from the freeneſſe of grace, would argue a liberty to ſinne, as if the plenty of the one would incourage to multiply the other, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1.

This is much propheſied of as the fruit of the Goſpel, that the ſavage, cruel and poyſonous natures of wicked men, ſhall be ſtrangely taken away, <hi>Iſa. 35. 5, 6, 7. The eyes of the blinde ſhall

Corinthians 2. 4. When therefore by the ſimple, plain and pure demonſtration of Divine truths, and of Gods Word, you ſee the hearts and conſciences of flagitious men awakened; you ſee them changed into holy, godly, heavenly men, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, foul and ungodly. What glorious praite doth hereby redound to the word preached? This is like <hi>Davids</hi> little ſtone, ſlung into the head of great <hi>Goliah.</hi> If men of wiſdom, eloquence, ingenuity, and excellent Morality, if theſe onely were the men converted? it would quickly be thought that it was ſome excellency in them, rather then the power of Gods word without; but in theſe groſs livers it cannot be attributed to any thing in the world, but the word preached: Deſpiſe not therefore the plain and powerful preaching of Gods word; for that is the muſtard ſeed, which though little in quantity, is in operation mighty: You ſee twelve men indued with ability to preach this, did quickly leaven this whole world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>God makes his grace to come to ſuch great ſinners ſometimes, that his</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>tender mercies and compaſſions may be made the more illuſtrious:</hi> As it was Chriſts pitty to cure that cripple, that lay thirty years by the pools ſide, and had no man to help him; ſo theſe ſinners that are bound in ſtronger chains then others, whom the Devil detaineth in ſurer chains then others, its a greater act of pitty and grace to reſcue them: Thus <hi>Paul</hi> being ſenſible of himſelf, as the greateſt of all ſinners, how paſſionately doth he break out to admire the mercy and grace of God to him: So that when we ſee a wretched obſtinate ſinner, who careth for nothing, feareth nothing, is not able to pitty himſelf, converted and inlightned by the grace of God; here are tender bowels, God pittieth him more then man doth himſelf. As <hi>Hierom</hi> ſaid of the poor dumb man that cannot ſpeak or beg for an alms, <hi>Maxime rogat, dum non poteſt rogare,</hi> The more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able he is to ſpeak, the more he doth ſpeak, moving compaſſion and pitty. Thus a wicked man, who is indeed dumb ſpiritually, cannot ſpeak, cannot pray, cannot utter any one word in his behalf, is thereby an object of pitty with God, becauſe ſo miſerable: If then you ask, Why are ſuch mens eyes opened? why do ſuch men underſtand what they did not? Chriſt in mercy hath ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, <hi>Ariſe and walk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Grace converts ſometimes notorious ſinners, to confound the pride and ſwelling thoughts of ſelf-righteous men. There are a generation of men, whoſe ways</hi>

                     <hi>are clean in their own eyes,</hi> Prov. 16. 1. men who juſtifie themſelves, bleſſing God they are not like other men; now when the grace of God comes and worketh
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:30767:205"/>
upon the moſt profligate ſinners, leaving others to their own pride and conceited righteouſneſs, hereby they are confounded and aſhamed: Thus it was diſcovered by our Saviour, he tells the Phariſees, <hi>That the publicans and harlots ſhould go into the kingdom of heaven before them;</hi> and, <hi>He came not to call ſuch righteous as they were, but ſinners to repentance;</hi> Mat. 9. 13. There are none commonly further off true grace, then thoſe who pleaſe themſelves with the conceit of their own goodneſs and righteouſneſs. The emptieſt ear of corn growes up higheſt, and holds its head above others; but thoſe who have true grace, are deeply ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their own inſufficiency and imperfections; their righteouſneſs, is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail their own unrighteouſneſs: It falls out therefore, that there is ſometimes more hope of a groſs ſinner, then a civilized Phariſee; for the one is ſooner convinced, his conſcience is eaſier awakened; but the other being already falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded of his own worth, can hardly be changed: <hi>Ille morbus vix eſt ſanabilis qui ſanitatem imitatur,</hi> That diſeaſe which is like health, is hardly cured; and thus a man living a life like godlineſs, when it is not ſo indeed, is ſeldom truly reformed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>God will have ſome of the worſt of men ſometimes converted, that the Miniſters of God, who are ſometimes caſt upon ſuch a people, might not ſow without</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>hope, nor preach without hope:</hi> Even a wilderneſs may become a pleaſant river, even a <hi>Mary Magdalene,</hi> a Publican, may be converted by preaching; What then may not the Miniſters of God expect? though their ſoul (as <hi>David</hi> ſaith) <hi>lyeth down among Lyons:</hi> We may not always ſay, <hi>Wo be to us, becauſe we live in the tents of Kedar,</hi> for God may make that like <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> A place where nothing but bryars and thorns came up, may be made a pleaſant garden: Chriſt told his Diſciples, <hi>He ſent them like ſheep amongſt wolves,</hi> Mat. 10. 16. and yet theſe ſheep made many wolves ſheep like themſelves: Though therefore we catch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when we caſt our nets; yea, though we catch ſcorpions inſtead of fiſhes, yet theſe ſcorpions may be made fiſhes: <hi>With God all things are poſſible,</hi> ſaith our Savior, Mat. 19. 26. ſpeaking of this very thing, to convert men, which is to make a Camel go through the eye of a needle: Though therefore humane reaſon may tell a man, there is no ſucceſs to be expected, no good to be done, becauſe a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſo and ſo vicious; yet we muſt not regard the dead womb, but the power of God: <hi>Its he that opens the barren womb, and makes thoſe that were fruitleſs to bring forth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Therefore God will have ſome of theſe Beelzebub ſinners converted, that ſo grace may be acknowledged to be a real, manifeſt, powerful work, and that in the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>eyes of all the world:</hi> Men are prone to judge godlineſs, nothing but the Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, and the tender conſtitution of ſome mens bodies, or their black imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or fancies which ariſe within; but now when ſuch, who have been ſo long, ſo continual in evil and ungodly ways, they ſhall love and delight in what they once loathed: This makes godlineſs a palpable viſible thing: When <hi>Paul</hi> a blaſphemer, a curſed oppoſer of the ways of Chriſt, is converted, and ſets up that which he once pulled down, this makes all men ſee Gods Grace is not a notion, but a real lively work upon a man. That as the whole world won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, when they ſaw Chriſt work ſuch palpable miracles, <hi>making the blinde to ſee, the deaf to hear, the dead toriſe,</hi> they concluded he was God; here could be no impoſture or deceit, the things were ſo manifeſt: Thus when God calls ſome wicked men, and makes them forſake all the pleaſures and profits, leave the cuſtom receipt immediately, deny their parents, friends, and all that might work upon natural affections; all the prophane and carnal company to whom their ſouls was once glewed; this muſt make every man ſay, Here is more then no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, here is a real fire. The Poets taught much of <hi>Circe's</hi> cup, which turned men into beaſts, but here is a change of beaſts into men, yea into Angels; and we may ſay, <hi>This work of the Lord is marvellous in our eyes.</hi>

                  <p>Why do we not ſee God working thus as wonderfully to the change of men, <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> as he hath done heretofore? there the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and other Heathens, wallowing in Idolatry, and all moral vices, yet found the word of God aſſimilating them to its own nature; it made men leave their corrupt and defiled natures, and come to imbrace that which formerly was ſo contrary to them: But now we ſee no ſuch things done, no not among Chriſtians; in thoſe days an Heathen Adulterer, an Heathen a Drunkard, became waſhed and cleanſed by the word; but now a Chriſtian thus polluted, notwithſtanding his Chriſtianity, and the word frequently preached unto him, doth not reform and make him leave his former impieties.</p>

                  <p>We may ſay of every regenerate man, Such wicked men you were once, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane as others, negligent as others, ſenſeleſs of ſin and Gods wrath as others, but now this dark night is turned into a glorious day. The Prophet ſpake of ſome, <hi>Amoſ 6. 12. That they turned righteouſneſs into hemlock and wormwood:</hi> That was a wicked turning, but this turneth hemlock into righteouſneſs. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet complained of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> fallen from her mercies, <hi>That her gold was become droſs, and her wine water,</hi> Lam. 4. but here is the contrary, droſs is become gold, and water wine. <hi>Ego non ſum ego,</hi> ſaid an unclean perſon once converted, to the whore that ſollicited him to the ſame courſes ſtill: So do thou ſay to all thy former wickedneſs, catching hold on thee as <hi>Joſephs</hi> miſtreſs did on him; I am not I, I have not the ſame judgement, the ſame affections, the ſame deſires that once I had, and therefore cannot imbrace what I once ſo dearly loved. The exact handling of this point will be, when we come to thoſe Texts that call it
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:30767:206"/>
converſion, or a change, or a turning to God; then the term from which, and the term to which, may more largely be conſidered: Onely I ſhall now give you ſome qualities of this turning, and change from our evil ways, truly to ſtir you up immediately to the practiſe thereof. We ſee God hath wrought many changings and turnings of things in our days: O how happy, if in all theſe, we might ſee this ſpiritual change, men formerly prophane, now holy; men here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore guilty of notorious ſins, now as exemplary and zealous of what is godly.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, <hi>Therefore this change is a neceſſary one:</hi> It muſt be ſaid of every one <note place="margin">1. The qualities of a gracious change or turning from our evil ways.</note> that would be ſaved, <hi>Such an one thou once waſt, but now thou art ſanctified.</hi> Even the man who hath always lived civilly and unblameably, that hath no groſs ſin to be turned from, yet he hath the ſoul-uncleanneſs, and the heart-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eproſie up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, from which he muſt be waſhed; ſo that this turning from what once we were, is indiſpenſibly neceſſary in yong and old, in rich and poor, either inwardly or outwardly: Conſider of this therefore, you whoſe Motto is, <hi>Sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per idem;</hi> though that be a glory in a good thing, yet for a man to be always the ſame he was from the womb, is certain and irrecoverable death; When then will you bethink your ſelves? when ſhall the time be, that thou wilt become another man? think not that fleſh and blood can inherit the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: This undoeth many, that as they never dream of a change, which death will one day make upon them, ſo they never deſire a change, that Grace in this preſent life ſhould work on them: Therefore as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid of the change by death, <hi>He would every day wait till his change came,</hi> Job 14. 14. (as ſome expound it:) do thou ſay of this change by grace, I will every day pray, hear, read, meditate, mourn and roar out before God all the day long, till this ſpiritual change come.</p>
                  <p>Scondly, <hi>Its a rational change:</hi> Its the higheſt act of reaſon, for a man to <note place="margin">2.</note> become another man: For ſeeing the Scripture, which cannot lye, informeth us both of original and actual pollution, whereby we become no more qualified for heaven, then Toades to be made Angels: This being granted, its the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reaſon in the world, that thou ſhouldſt immediately ariſe, and go out from thy own ſelf; For how wilt thou, who art but ſtubble and dry wood, be able to indure this conſuming fire of Gods wrath? Again, its rational, becauſe its for the better: Though men do not love to change, yet when its for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then they are glad; How do men thus change, in all their outward affairs? but herein turning from ſinto grace, we tranſcendently have the advantage; we change corruption for glory, coals for gold, luſt and ſin, for the enjoyment of God, and communion with him: So that if men would ſet judgement on work, and conſider what that is they were once; and what that is to which God now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them, they would make no delay, but riſe up and be doing. Again, its the greateſt reaſon thus to change, becauſe we our ſelves are ſubject to a total change by death: We cannot always live and abound in our pleaſures, and our jollities, but death will at laſt come and make a wonderful change: Oh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be changed ſpiritually, before thou art changed corporally; the time will come, when it will be ſaid of thee, Thou livedſt in ſuch advantages, in ſuch comforts, but now thou art not, death hath ſwallowed up all thy temporal joy, and life it ſelf: Oh let it be for the preſent ſaid, Thou didſt live once in ſuch wickedneſs, in ſuch impieties, but now all is altered: <hi>I beſeech you as pilgrims, abſtain from the luſts of the fleſh,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 11. <hi>Remember you are pilgrims and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers, you have no abiding place in this world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Its a profitable change: What profit have you of thoſe things, whereof</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>you now are aſhamed,</hi> Rom. 6. 1. Alas, thy ſins are no ways profitable to thee, for all the curſes of God both temporal and ſpiritual do accompany them; but godlineſs is profitable for all things: Though it would <hi>not profit a man, to gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul,</hi> yet it would exceedingly profit a man, to
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:30767:207"/>
gain his ſoul, though he loſt all the world: Though he ſaid, <hi>Miſerum eſt illud verbum fuiſſe,</hi> yet here, <hi>Faelix &amp; beatum verbum eſt fuiſſe:</hi> Its a bleſſed and happy word, to ſay, Such an ungodly man once, but now not at all; ſuch an one that ſcorned and deſpiſed the ways of God, but now he loveth and rejoyceth in them; even as the Prodigals Father rejoyced over his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting ſon, <hi>He was dead, but now is alive; he was loſt, but now is found:</hi> Thus mayeſt thou, with joy and thankſgiving, ſay, I was loſt, but grace hath found me; I was dead, but grace hath inlivened me.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Its an honorable change: For thoſe that honor God, God will honor,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 30. As thoſe that ſerve baſe and vile luſts, the Lord giveth them <note place="margin">4</note> upto contempt and ſcorn before others. Its true, in the eyes of the world, to ſet upon this change, its many times object of diſdain, To leave thy luſts, thy wantonneſs, thy pride, thy jolly companions, and to betake thy ſelf to a more accurate and exact way of godlineſs, makes a man the drunkards ſong, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69. 12. as <hi>David</hi> complained he was: But as <hi>David</hi> was then more honorable, when he danced ſo Religiouſly before the Ark, then when he conquered and ſubdued ſo many Philiſtims, although <hi>Michal</hi> deſpiſed him and ſcorned him at her very heart: Thus it is here, ſince thou haſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken thy ſinnes, feared an oath, been conſtant in Private and Family Prayer, zealouſly ſanctifying Gods Sabbaths, which he hath commanded: Since this (I ſay) thou art become truly honorable, and art born of God.</p>
                  <p>Uſe of Exhortation, <hi>To raiſe and awaken your ſelves out of your former im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> Oh that once we might ſay, You were dead, but now are made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live: Oh that at laſt we might ſay this Text, <hi>Such and ſuch hainous offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſome of you have been; but now ye are waſhed, now ye are ſanctified through the blood of Chriſt.</hi> Call thy ſelf to an account, ſay, Oh my ſoul, doeſt thou minde to be thus always? Are there no purpoſes or reſolutions to become another man? Why doth not he that uſed to ſwear, ſwear no more? Why doth not he that uſed to be luſtful, be luſtful no more? <hi>Let him that ſtole</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>ſteal no more,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 28. Oh that God would make this bleſſed change in your lives! What ſhould hinder it? Can your ſinnes be better then GOD to you? Can your luſts be more then Heaven to you?</p>

                  <p>WE have already conſidered the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> according to what they were by their own voluntary corruption, <hi>Let us now take notice of them, as what they are by grace.</hi> They were black and uncomely of themſelves, but ſanctified and made beautifull by the grace of God. Now this grace of God vouchſafed unto them is expreſſed in three particulars, Ye are <hi>Waſhed,</hi> Ye are <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified,</hi> Ye are <hi>Juſtified.</hi> Some make this difference between them, That the firſt priviledge, <hi>Ye are waſhed,</hi> is a general comprehending both Sanctification and Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; as if the Apoſtle had firſt expreſſed himſelf in the general, and then diſtributed this general into two famous branches thereof: and indeed waſhing or cleanſing is ſometimes uſed for the taking away of the guilt of ſin, and then it is the ſame with juſtification; as when <hi>David</hi> prayeth God would waſh him &amp; make him clean, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 51. and ſomtimes its uſed for the cleanſing from the filth and power of ſin, in which ſenſe its the ſame with ſanctification: and in this reſpect, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 1. God cals upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to waſh her, and to make her clean: This may well be received: But I <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> goe with other Expoſitors, that make the Apoſtle uſe a gradation, naming thoſe priviledges in the order God beſtowed them upon them: and the firſt is Waſhing, that is Regeneration; the Type whereof and Seal is Baptiſm; which was the firſt thing done to them, when received into the Church: ſo that the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is; But ye are ſpirituallly waſhed and cleanſed from the filth and dominion of theſe ſins, a Seal whereof was your Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>Then the ſecond degree is <hi>Sanctified,</hi> which is a further grace of God, not only regenerating, but making us holy unto the Lord, and cauſing us to walk as thoſe that are ſet apart for God, from all common and prophane uſe. Laſtly, they are <hi>Juſtified.</hi> Now although it be ſeriouſly diſputed, whether Juſtification or Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication goe before one another; and generally it is aſſerted, that in priority of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture a man is juſtified before he be ſanctified, though they be both together in time; yet withall they acknowledge, that according to our ſenſe and feeling, and the Method we muſt take for comfort, we apprehend our Sanctification before our Juſtification; and no man may perſwade himſelf, that he is juſtified, who doth not diſcover in himſelf the fruits of Sanctification. The one is the fruit, the other is the tree: ſo that the Apoſtle may very well put ſanctification firſt, becauſe to our ſenſe and apprehenſion it is ſo. As for that interpretation of Papiſts and others, that make juſtified, to be the obtaining of a further degree of righteouſneſſe, and increaſing in holineſſe, we reject as erroneous. Now this threefold mercy is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified by the meritorious cauſe, <hi>In the Name of the Lord Jeſus.</hi> That is by Jeſus Chriſt known and beleeved on; as alſo by the efficient cauſe, the Spirit of our God, which is therefore called the holy Spirit, as being in an appropriated manner, the
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:30767:208"/>
Author of our Sanctification. Thus the Text is opened. I begin with the firſt, <hi>Ye are waſhed;</hi> and obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That Regeneration, or the renewing of ſinners is a waſhing or cleanſing of them.</hi> Sin <note place="margin">Obſ.</note> hath two things in it, Filthand Pollution, and ſo Sanctification cureth it; guilt and merit of condemnation, ſo juſtification taketh it away. We are upon the firſt work of grace, that which takes away the noiſomnes, and pollution of ſin, with the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and power of it, which is here called Waſhing and Sanctifying. The <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> like Swine had been wallowing in their Mire, and grace did not onely waſh their out-ſides, but their in-ſides, their very natures away, and make them ſheep. Thus God ſpeaketh of a clear Fountain he will ſet open for <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to waſh in. <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 1. For the diſcovery of this point, conſider,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That the Title of Regeneration, under the notion of waſhing, doth ſuppoſe that ſinne is of a defiling polluting nature, making the perſons unclean and loathſome,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Sin of a defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling nature.</note> 
                     <hi>where it is.</hi> Its therefore compared to <hi>Spots, Deut.</hi> 32. 5. and <hi>Blemiſhes,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 27, to <hi>Mire,</hi> to <hi>Vomit, 2 Pet.</hi> 2. 22. Such names doth the Scripture give ſinne: to teach men, How they ſhould look upon themſelves, when ſinners? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. you have there the Prophet excellently deſcribing every mans naturall condition, by an infant new born, tumbling in its bloud, not waſhed, or cleanſed. Men make ſin the matter of their boaſt, and their glory; but it is indeed matter of ſhame and loathing. Thou art aſhamed of thy rags, and thy ſpotted garments: But oh what bluſhing ſhould be at thy wicked and ungodly actions. Thou ſhouldeſt ſit down like a <hi>Iob</hi> upon his Dung-hill, abhorring thy ſelf; like a <hi>Lazarus</hi> full of ſores; like an unclean Leaper, crying out, <hi>Thou art unclean, unclean.</hi> The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaking of wicked men, ſaith, <hi>They are become filthy and abhominable in their doings, Pſalme</hi> 14. and it calls them <hi>Vile perſons,</hi> Pſal. 15. 4. Whatſoever eſteem and glory ungodly men may have in this world, yet they are with God vile perſons, and therefore called by the name of ſuch Beaſts as are odious to men. Whereas on the contrary, Grace is the life, the beauty, the honour and glory of a man, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to excellent and precious ornaments.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>This apprehenſion that ſinne makes men unclean and defiled, hath been</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Superſtitious bodily-waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</note> 
                     <hi>ſo ingraven in the hearts of all men by nature, that therefore they have uſed ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitiouſly many externall bodily waſhings:</hi> as if that would take away their polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make them more acceptable to God. Thus the Heathens uſed to waſh themſelves, before they entred into their Temples, to ſacrifice to their Gods, and they had water pots, or ſtones of water ſtood at the entrance into the Temple, wherein thy purified themſelves; confeſſing hereby, that ſin made them ſo beaſtly and unclean, that they were no wayes fit or decent to perform any Religious acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: and thus the <hi>Iewes</hi> they brought in many ſuperſtitious Waſhings: When they came from Market, when they had been about any imployment, they would come home and waſh themſelves, yea they waſh'd their Beds, their Pots, their Di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhes, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 4 l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt they ſhould get any defilement. Thus <hi>Pilate</hi> did waſh his hands, to denote thereby his Innocency; and <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks of the ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſome Chriſtians in his dayes, That they would never goe to prayer, till they had waſhed themſelves. Now our Saviours Doctrine is a good Antidote to all ſuch ſuperſtitious thoughts: Not that which goeth into a man doth defile him, but that which comes out. Its not a bodily filthineſſe, or uncleanneſſe, but a ſoul-filthineſſe, which is ſo diſpleaſing to God. The Papiſts they attribute much to <note place="margin">Mar. 7. 15, 16.</note> their Holy-water, as if the ſprinkling of that would cleanſe away the ſtone of the ſoul, but this is the peculiar effect of Chriſts bloud onely.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>That we might be fully convinced of our native filthineſſe, and the nature of Gods Spirit in renewing us, God appointed externall Ordinances and Rites of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. The uſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances and Rites.</note> 
                     <hi>waſhing, hereby to make us underſtand ſpirituall things.</hi> Thus in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, God commanded ſeverall waſhings of the body: The Prieſt was to waſh himſelf before he ſacrificed; and ſeverall other cleanſings there were; by all which God did inform them of their vileneſſe and loathſomneſſe; as alſo there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:30767:208"/>
to look to Chriſts bloud, of which theſe were Types: As the Apoſtle argueth at large to the Hebrews. In the New Teſtament alſo, although the externall Rites are but few in number, which Chriſt appointed under the Goſpell, his Church being now out of her Infancy, and ſo more inabled to diſcern ſpirituall things of themſelves. Yet one of the two Sacraments, <hi>viz.</hi> Baptiſm, God hath appointed for this end, to ſignifie our naturall pollution, and the renewing operation of Gods Spirit: Thus Baptizing is as much as Waſhing. All that are made Chriſts Diſciples he would have waſhed, to ſhew that they had noyſomneſſe upon them; and that the Spirit of God muſt cleanſe their ſouls. <hi>John 3. 5. Unleſſe a man be born of Water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdome of heaven;</hi> He doth not ſpeak of Baptiſm there; for Chriſt had not at that time appointed Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm (though <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptized) and to be ſure it was not appointed then univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally to all Nations, as appeareth by the Commiſſion afterwards; <hi>Goe, Baptize all Nations.</hi> This is confeſſed by <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himſelf: I rather therefore take wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the Spirit of God, as afterwards it is compared to fire; ſo that the ſenſe is, <hi>Unleſſe a Man be born of the Spirit of God,</hi> which is like water, cleanſing, healing, quenching, Sanctifying, <hi>he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> But though this place carry it not, yet many other places ſpeak of this Baptiſm, and the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification thereof: ſo that the foulneſſe of ſinne, and the nature of Regeneration is excellently decyphered by the Sacrament of Baptiſm. Doe not thou then reſt in thy Baptiſm, doe not preſume upon that; for unleſſe thereby thou art taught to loath thy ſelf for ſinne: unleſſe thou art waſhed from filthy ſinnes and luſtfull wayes, this waſhing is no more to thee, than the waſhing of a Blackamoor, which leaves him as deformed as he was. Oh that Baptized men, waſhed men ſhould yet be ſo foul and noiſome in their lives, unclean bodies, foul tongues, earthly hearts; all theſe defile.</p>
                  <p>Conſider that place, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10. 22. where the Apoſtle ſheweth the duty, and the priviledge of of the people of God; they may come with boldneſſe unto God, he hath held out the Scepter of Grace to invite them. But who are thoſe whom God will thus honour?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Such as are waſhed from an evill Conſcience; all thoſe who waſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from all known evils; who avoid inward ſinnes, pride, hypocriſie, earthly <note place="margin">Who God ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours with bold acceſſe unto him.</note> and immoderate affections, Oh thou canſt have no boldneſſe to pray, or to call on God, whoſe Conſcience tels thee of ſuch defilement and wickedneſſe thou liveſt in: And,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Their bodies waſhed with pure water. This is an alluſion either to the legal waſhings, or to Baptiſm; and implyes, that not onely the ſoul, but the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy alſo muſt be waſhed from all its bodily filthineſs, as 2 <hi>Cor. 7. Let us cleanſe our ſelves from all filthineſſe of fleſh and Spirit;</hi> ſo that ſoul-wickedneſs, and bodily wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs muſt be waſhed away,</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Therefore the Scripture ſpeaketh of a two fold ſubject to be waſhed.</hi> Firſt, the heart; thus as in the place mentioned, having your hearts ſprinkled <note place="margin">4. Of the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the heart.</note> and cleanſed from all filthineſſe of ſpirit. This heart-waſhing is firſt to be ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as being the root, principle, and foundation. Thus purifie your hearts, ye double minded, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 8. If the Fountain be not cleanſed, all the ſtreams muſt needs be muddy. Now although moſt men neglect this Duty, yet this is the main of all. A bad heart is an ill Treaſury: out of the heart proceed evill thoughts, and all manner of actuall evill. This point our Saviour preſſed much upon the Phariſees, who had cleanſed their lives from outward wickedneſſe, but their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards were full of all foul and noiſome luſts: and the neceſſity of this appeareth, in that God accepteth of no externall religious Duty, no Praying, no Hearing, no Charitie, no Humilitie, except they be firſt waſhed in their hearts; There lyeth the greateſt filthineſſe, though you muſt take the candle of the Scripture, if you would find out the Duſt there, and ſweep it away.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond kind of waſhing the Scripture ſpeaks of, is the waſhing of our

hands, which is the cleanſing of us from all actions of Wickedneſſe; as Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, Oppreſſion, Uncleanneſſe, and all manner of unlawful and ſinful do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. <note place="margin">The waſhing of our hands.</note> Thus <hi>Iames</hi> addeth, <hi>Cleanſe your hands, and Purifie your hearts:</hi> He ſaith, firſt Cleanſe your hands, and then Purifie your hearts. Not that the waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the hands is to be done before the waſhing of the heart; but becauſe our Actions they are moſt manifeſt and ſenſible to the world; and therefore we ought to declare our ſelves clear in that reſpect. So then, no man may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort himſelf, as if Regenerated or renewed, if ſo be his Actions are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oul and ſinfull: If thy hands be not clean, thou maiſt not take hold of any holy thing. Conſider <hi>Davids</hi> Expreſſion, <hi>I will waſh my hands in innocency, ſo will I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe thy Altar, Pſal. 26. 2. David</hi> will not come to worſhip God, till he hath waſhed his hands in innocency. Oh conſider this excellent and holy pattern which <hi>David</hi> hath left for you. Say, I will waſh my life, my hands, my eyes, my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die from all its former wickedneſſe, and ſo will I pray, ſo will I goe to hear. <hi>Lay aſide all ſuperfluity of naughtineſſe,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 21. He cals ſin <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Sordes,</hi> filth and loathſome matter, and then hear the Word of God. As thoſe that made the Garland of Roſes and other Flowers, for thoſe that conquered in the Race, they were to have clean and waſhed hands; ſo all thoſe who meddle in any holy duty, praying, or hearing, they muſt have cleanſed lives: when God gave the Law, he would have the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> cleanſe themſelves three dayes before they heard it; and the women who were to come into <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, were ſeverall dayes purifying, and dreſſing themſelves. How much more then, when we come into the preſence of an holy God, ought we to cleanſe our ſelves, and to ſhake off all that which may be diſpleaſing in his eyes.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>To be ſpiritually waſhed and cleanſed there are theſe things required:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5. What is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſpiritual waſhing. I.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>a loathing and abhorring of our ſelves;</hi> looking upon our ſelves as ſo many bruitiſh beaſts, and ſo many abhominable Monſters, fit for nothing but to be caſt upon the Dung-hill, becauſe we have loſt all our Savour. Thus <hi>Job</hi> abhorred him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in duſt and aſhes, under the apprehenſion of Gods glorious Majeſty. <hi>Ezek. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>0.</hi> 43. The Promiſe of grace made to the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is, <hi>That they ſhould remember their wicked doings, wherein they have been defiled, and they ſhould loath themſelves in their own ſight. We bluſh,</hi> ſaith <hi>Daniel</hi> and <hi>Ezra, and are aſhamed.</hi> Thus the P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>can ſtood aloof oft, as deeply ſenſible of his uncleaneneſſe. Oh then, how farre are moſt men from this waſhing in the Text; when did they ever loath them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? when were they abominable in their own eyes? when did they humble themſelves in the duſt, crying out they were noiſome Dung-hills, and not men. They could not indure their own ſelves: The very memory and thoughts of all their wayes were grievous and tedious to them. Till men come thus to be aſhamed and confounded in themſelves, they cannot be ſo much as in a preparation to be made clean. Oh tremble then, you who applaud your ſelves, who love and pleaſe your ſelves in your wicked wayes, like the Horſe-Beetle, that delights to live in the Dung; like Vermine, that love to be in Muck-hils. Oh why are ye not aſhamed that God ſhould ſee you, that good Angels and men ſhould behold you. It will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be well with thee, nor wilt thou ever be put into any hopes of ſalvation, till thou beginneſt to be odious in thy own eyes, till thou canſt not abide and indurethy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>To be waſhed, is required godly ſorrow, and morning for ſinne. David waſhed his Bed with tears,</hi> and ſo he did his ſoul alſo. Not that our tears or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <note place="margin">II.</note> can waſh away the guilt of ſin. No, there can be no remiſſion without bloud, <hi>Heb</hi> 9. 22. and the bloud of Chriſt; but they may in ſome ſenſe waſh the filth and defilements of ſinne away. Therefore there is Gods waſhing, which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks much of, and that is the remiſſion of the guilt of ſinne; and there is our waſhing, which is the godly, ſorrow and mourning for the iniquities we have committed: ſo then if thou wouldſt be a man waſhed from thy ſinfull pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, conſider, That thy head muſt be like a fountain of tears, thy eyes muſt be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the Pool of <hi>Betheſda</hi> in this ſenſe, that thy filthineſſe may be waſhed away.
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:30767:209"/>
How then canſt thou perſwade thy ſelf, that thou haſt received this priviledge, when thy heart was never melted for thy ſins: Godly ſorrow is wholly a ſtrange thing to thee, thou doſt not know what it means. Alas! thoſe ſuddain exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, The Lord forgive me, God pardon me, I ſhould not have ſaid ſo, or done ſo: This is not the godly ſorrow commanded in the Scripture; why then doſt thou lie with thy filth and unclean abominations upon thee? why doſt thou not mourn and lament over thy wretched condition? What haſt thou tears for the loſſe of wife, children, goods and eſtate, but none for the loſſe of God? Tears in thy eyes are better Jewels than thoſe on thy ears.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>To be waſhed, there is alſo required a ſpirituall pain and trouble of the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">III.</note> 
                     <hi>ſoul.</hi> For this waſhing of a ſinner, is like the waſhing of pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rified old ſores which cannot but adminiſter great grief and aches, as when the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ailor waſhed <hi>Peters</hi> ſores: Therefore <hi>David</hi> expreſſeth his Repentance by broken bones, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 51. which declareth the holy pain and trouble of ſoul he had within him, becauſe of his iniquities. Hence it is alſo called pricking and wounding at heart. Go to therefore you ſinners, who live heart-whole, and heart-ſound, as you call it, you never have any pangs, any travail of ſoul for your iniquities, you never are in labour or pain; know, that you are not waſhed from your impieties: why doſt thou not take up the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi>'s expreſſion, <hi>Mich. 1. 8. I will wail and houl, I will go ſtript and naked, I will make a mourning like the Dragons, and wailing like the Owls,</hi> becauſe of the anguiſh of mind, and trouble of ſoul upon me for my iniquities. Never think it will be well, till thoſe ſinnes which have been ſo ſweet and pleaſant to thee, be like Gall and Wormwood, biting like a Serpent, and ſtinging like an Adder. It cannot be, but that theſe luſts for a ſeaſon ſo delightful, will afterwards become like ſo many devils tormenting thy conſcience. Be not afraid to be ſick and troubled for ſin now, it may be medicinal and helpful now, but it wil be paenal and eternally tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>To be cleanſed, there is required a constant and daily applying of thoſe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">IIII.</note> 
                     <hi>remedies, which are appointed by God to make us clean;</hi> and that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aith in Chriſts bloud, and faith receiving the Word of God. The bloud of Chriſt and the Word of God are both cleanſers. Thus <hi>Acts</hi> 15. Faith is ſaid to purifie the heart; and <hi>David</hi> prayeth, <hi>Pſalme 51. That God would waſh him with Hyſſop, and make him clean, ſo he ſhould be whiter than Snow:</hi> an alluſive expoſition to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of beſprinkling the Poſts of the door with the bloud of the Sacrifice, which ſignified the bloud of Chriſt ſprinkled upon the ſoul, and faith that is like the bunch of Hyſſop, which though low and contemptible, yet was inſtrumental to that glorious effect. Thus alſo the garments of the Saints are ſaid to be made white in the bloud of the Lamb; though it be red, yet it makes them white: Therefore faith in Chriſt is mighty in operation to get out all the ſpots and defilements that are upon our lives.</p>
                  <p>The other cleanſing Inſtrument is the word of God, cleanſing his Church through his Word; and <hi>Pſalme 119. Wherewith ſhall a young man make clean his wayes? even by attending to thy Word.</hi> A young man moſt prone to foul and noiſome luſts, even he may quickly by the Word be waſhed and cleanſed. Come then often in this Bath, waſh thy ſelf often in the waters of the Scripture, and then thou wilt become white and lovely.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>This waſhing is a continual work.</hi> Though the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>They are wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,</hi> in the by-paſt time; yet becauſe man in his journey to heaven, gets much <note place="margin">V.</note> ſoil and filth; therefore he muſt be waſhing himſelf every day, <hi>Iohn 13. 9. 10. Peter</hi> did not underſtand that our Saviour taught this, by his action of waſhing their feet; but when he did, he cryeth out, <hi>Not my feet only, but alſo my hands and head.</hi> Now that the moſt godly themſelves doe need a continual waſhing, appeareth by that: He that is waſhed, needeth not, ſave to waſh his feet. The meaning of this difficult place ſeemeth to be, That though they were cleanſed by Regeneration, yet in their travel towards heaven, they got filth upon their feet, which they ought
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:30767:210"/>
every day to waſh off; ſo that as thou getteſt pollution upon thy ſoul daily, ſo thou muſt cleanſe daily: Where then are thoſe deluded perſons, who think themſelves without ſin, that they need no cleanſing? even therefore they have the more ſin, becauſe they think they have no ſin.</p>
                  <p>Uſe of Exhortation, <hi>To all prophane and ungodly perſons,</hi> that they would abominate and loath themſelves, be in their own eyes as they are in Gods <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> ſight, hated and abhorred. How can you but conſider and be afraid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der theſe things: Thy actions, are foul actions; thy life, a noiſom life; thy words, loathſom communication: Thou art like a dead carcaſe, like an open Sepulchre, ful of abomination: Oh that thou canſt abide thy ſelf! Thou ſhouldſt be as ſome miſerable wretch, that hath the members of his body rotting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and yet he liveth, how loathſome is ſuch a man to himſelf? he cannot indure his own ſmell: Thus it ſhould be to thee, who liveſt in thy groſs wickedneſs.</p>

                     <p>Of the Grace of God ſanctifying a Sinner.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <epigraph>
                     <bibl>1 COR. 6. 11.</bibl>
                     <q>And ſuch were ſome of you, but you are waſhed, but you are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, &amp;c.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THe Apoſtle (as you heard) is now deſcribing what the <hi>Corinthians</hi> are by the grace of God; which is threefold, <hi>Waſhing</hi> (and that is diſpatched;) <hi>Sanctifying,</hi> and that is the work now in hand. As for <hi>Illyricus</hi> his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that takes theſe three things for the ſame, making them onely words <hi>Synonymous,</hi> there is no colour for it; come we therefore to handle the nature of this gracious work of God, and the word hath many and ſeveral acceptions, in the Scripture, which are neceſſary to be known.</p>
                  <p>The firſt and ordinary uſe of the word, is for <hi>the external celebrating and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The word ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified its ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral acceptions.</note> 
                     <hi>the Name and Ordinances of God as holy:</hi> Thus we pray, <hi>Sanctified be thy name;</hi> and very often we are commanded <hi>To ſanctifie the Lord;</hi> which is then done, when we do with all holy fear and reverence make mention of him, and acknowledge his Majeſty; the contrary whereunto, is to defile, to pollute and to blaſpheme his holy name.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>To Sanctifie, is often uſed in Scripture, for the ſeparating any thing from prophane and common uſe, as holy unto God:</hi> Thus all the veſſels in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were ſanctified, and the Prieſts were ſanctified; and in this ſenſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He ſanctified himſelf,</hi> viz. He prepared himſelf to be an expiatory Sacrifice for <note place="margin">John 17. 1.</note> our ſins.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>There are ſome who ſay the word to Sanctifie, is as much as to juſtifie, and to make holy and righteous through Chriſts Righteouſneſs;</hi> and therefore they ſpeak of an imputative Sanctification (which is the ſame with Juſtification) and is really inherent, but inchoate in this life. Thus they ſay Sanctification is taken for Juſtification, frequently in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, Heb. 10. By which will we are ſanstified;</hi> and <hi>Heb. 3. Chriſt that he might ſanctifie his people, ſuffered
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:30767:210"/>
without the gate;</hi> and thus Chriſt is ſaid <hi>To be made unto us, Wiſdom and Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi> But this ſenſe of the word is not ſo generally acknowledged.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>To ſanctifie, is ſometimes uſed for the preparing and deſigning of any to ſome great work and exploit;</hi> ſo <hi>Iſa.</hi> 13. The <hi>Medes</hi> are ſaid to be ſanctified, for the deſtruction of <hi>Babylon: I have commanded my ſanctified ones;</hi> yea, in the Scripture commonly the judgements of God upon the wicked, by way of war and ſlaughter, are compared to Sacrifices, and ſo thoſe that are inſtruments to execute them, in that ſenſe are ſanctified; yea, it ſignifieth to prepare or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor any thing, Jer. 6. <hi>Sanctifie a war,</hi> Mich. 3. <hi>If they do not give in their mouth, they prepare a war.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>The word is ſometimes uſed antiphraſtically, for the clear contrary,</hi> to ſanctifie, is then as much as to pollute, and to be unclean; thus <hi>Exod. 19. Lev..</hi> 8. Thoſe that did after an unclean maner draw nigh to holy things, they are ſaid to be ſanctified, that is, unclean: And thus whores in the Hebrew are called Holy, that is, polluted and vile; and thus <hi>Sacrum</hi> among the Latihs is uſed.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>There is a paſſive Sanctification, or a Work of God, whereby he changeth us, and maketh us of unholy, holy;</hi> and this is the grace intended in the Text: <hi>I pray God ye be ſanctified throughout,</hi> 1 Theſſ. ult. 1 Pet. 1. 1. <hi>Through the Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Spirit to obedience.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>There is an active Sanctification, whereby in the progreſs of holineſs, we daily purifie our ſelves, growing more and more holy,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 7. 1 John 3. <hi>He that hath this hope purifyeth or ſanctifieth himſelf, as God is holy:</hi> Theſe two latter ſenſes of the word, may be here chiefly intended.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That thoſe who are renewed by the Grace of God, they are ſanctified ones; they are</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> 
                     <hi>made holy, and purified from the filth and droſs that was in them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us firſt obſerve how the ſeveral ſenſes of the word <hi>Sanctified,</hi> formerly related, is aptly applicable to them: And <note place="margin">1. Wherein the people of God are ſanctified.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>They are Segregated from the world;</hi> They are choſen from that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane and common courſe of life they lived in before; that as the Veſſels were taken from all common uſe, and applied onely to ſacred actions, to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and other Offerings: Thus God by grace, doth take men, who before were under the power of Satan, at the command of every luſt, they were vile, unclean, fit for no holy imployments; now they are ſeparated from thoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer evils: <hi>Thus true Religion is that which keeps a man unſpotted from the world,</hi> James 1. 27. Thou doſt touch this pitch, and art not defiled; thou art in this Babylonian furnace, and haſt not thy garments ſigned: This is to be a true and a good ſeparatiſt, when by the heart and affections, a man forſaketh the ways of the world; though he be in the world, yet he is not of the world; for the world lying in wickedneſs, godlineſs cannot be but ſingularity and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeneſs, in reſpect of the multitude; therefore thou art not in the number of theſe ſanctified ones, nay thou canſt not ſay, thou art of the true Religion or haſt any true Religion at all, till thou keepeſt thy ſelf clean and unblameable from all the groſs and foul wickedneſs, that the world uſually commits.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The godly are ſanctified, becauſe they are not onely ſeparated from <note place="margin">2.</note> their former prophaneneſs, but they are alſo <hi>Dedicated and Conſecrated unto God,</hi> they are made his, and are peculiarly applyed unto him; in which ſenſe the godly are called <hi>A Royal Prieſthood,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9. and, <hi>The Firſt fruits,</hi> James 1. 18. thus they are ſaid to be <hi>none of their own,</hi> Phil. 4. <hi>The godly hath God ſet apart for himſelf</hi> (ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt;)</hi> ſo then, to be ſanctified, is to be given up wholly unto the Lord as his, no more a mans own, no more the worlds, no more ſins: Therefore all the ſins of a godly man, have a kinde of Sacriledge in them, they take their ſouls and bodies, which were conſecrated unto God, and apply them to prophane and the Devils uſe: Thus the Apoſtle argueth, <hi>Shall I take the Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, and make it one with an whore?</hi> 2 Cor. 6. In this manner,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:30767:211"/>
all the ſins of the godly are to be aggravated, Sin not with thy eyes, with thy hands, with thy body, thou makeſt the Temple of God an Hell, thou art guilty of high Sacriledge.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To be ſanctified you heard, was to be prepared and fitted for any great work and imployment; <hi>Thus alſo the people of God are created and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>for every good work:</hi> All the actions of grace are ſupernatural, far above humane power, they are Divine works, and therefore muſt have power from above to enable them thereunto. To leave thy ſins, thou muſt be ſanctified thereunto; to pray aright, to hear the word of God in a ſoul-ſaving maner, there muſt be a ſanctification of thy heart; eſpecially this is uſed for execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Juſtice upon the enemies of God and his glory: This is Gods Sacrifice, and thus every particular Chriſtian, he hath many Sacrifices, for the offering of which he needeth this Sanctification. A broken and contrite heart, that is a ſacrifice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. good works are a ſacrifice, prayer is a ſacrifice. Now as in the Old Teſtament they were peculiarly conſecrated and fitted thereunto; thus alſo in the New Teſtament, none can ſubdue ſin, approach nigh unto God in any holy way, that is not firſt ſanctified by his ſpirit, 2 <hi>Tim. 2. 21. Sanctified and meet for the Maſters uſe.</hi> As the <hi>Medes</hi> were ſanctified to deſtroy the <hi>Babylonions,</hi> ſo muſt thou be to kill thy luſts, to mortifie thy ſins: Though you are not now to kill beaſts, to deſtroy them unto God, yet ye have beaſtly luſts, which you are to mortifie continually; Pride, Covetouſneſs, Prophaneneſs, theſe are beaſtly luſts, which thou art ſanctified to deſtroy.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, To be ſanctified, in the Scripture ſenſe, <hi>Is to be made fit and lawful</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>for its proper uſe:</hi> Thus ſome expound that place, <hi>The unbelieving wife is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied through the believing husband,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. that is, made fit and lawful for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal relation, though that is not all the meaning; but we have another place, where every thing is ſaid <hi>to be ſanctified by the word of God and prayer,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 5. viz. All our Meats, Drinks, lawful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mployments, they are ſanctified by prayer: The curſe that is upon all the creatures is removed away, and thy meat is made fit to nouriſh thee, thy cloathes to warm thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In this ſenſe <hi>Divines</hi> ſpeak of a civil right, and a ſanctified right to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: <note place="margin">Of a Civil and Spiritual right to the Creature.</note> Wicked men have a civil, lawful right to the goods, to the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions they enjoy, and poſſeſs them with a good conſcience, but they want the ſanctified right of them; <hi>i. e.</hi> they have not the grace of God in their heart, whereby they might improve them in a godly maner, to the glory and honor of God; <hi>It being impoſſible without faith to pleaſe God:</hi> Oh then bewail thy condition! while thou art unſanctified, thou art not fit to eat, to drink, to be a poſſeſſor of any eſtate, any honor, any goods; not but that a wicked man is true owner of what he is, but he hath not a ſanctified uſe of them, he doth not eat or drink to the glory of God, his eſtate and wealth he knoweth not how to improve for bleſſed and heavenly ends.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>To ſanctifie, is to acknowledge and uſe all things that belong to God, after an holy, reverent and heavenly maner:</hi> Thus the people of God are often exhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>To ſanctifie God in their hearts,</hi> Iſa. 8. 13. and ſo they are commanded <hi>To ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie or keep holy his Sabbaths,</hi> Iſa. 29. 23. ſo that herein is a true ſanctified perſon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, when he doth with all holy fear and reverence approach near unto God in his Ordinances: Thus a godly man is deſcribed by this property, <hi>He feareth an oath,</hi> Eccleſ 92. becauſe an oath is a ſacred appeal unto God, as the witneſs of our actions, and becauſe his majeſty is ſo great and glorious, that we are unworthy to take his name into our mouthes; therefore he is ſaid <hi>To fear an oath,</hi> he trembleth to ſwear. O how far are thoſe then from Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who prophanely and paſſionately belch out their oathes, and without any reverence, yea in madneſs and fury, make mention of God in their Oathes. If thou weit ſanctified, thou wouldeſt acknowledge the Name, Perſon, Nature, Attributes and Ordinances of God Sacred and Holy, and ſo wouldſt after a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:30767:211"/>
humble and holy manner uſe them, and make mention of them: So that the ſwearer and the curſer, howſoever he may mitigate his ſin, that he didit in his paſſion, and he doth not think of it, yet he can never pretend to Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for where that is, it doth rule the heart with ſuch an holy and reverential awe of Gods Majeſty, that he never makes mention of him, but with Religious and trembling affections. Its admirable what the Heathens have been in this very point of ſwearing, how unwilling to do it, though in a lawful thing, and all becauſe of a devout apprehenſion they had of that Sacred Majeſty to whom they did appeal in their oathes. O then, what ſhame and confuſion ſhould this be to Chriſtians; there is ſcarce any old man, or yong man, any rich man, or poor man, but given to this deteſtable ſin of ſwearing, for which a man may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called prophane, be cauſe he hath low, deſpicable and irreverent thoughts of God. Another duty of a godly man ſanctified, is to keep holy his Sabbaths, as you read in many places; ſo that the looſe, careleſs and contemptuous deſpiſing of it, is an argument of an unſanctified heart: The godly make it their delight, and they keep a ſpiritual Sabbath from their ſins, and by this means, their ſouls enter into an holy reſt that day: But the ungodly man, he judgeth theſe days a burthen, a trouble, he longs to have them over, that he may to the world, or his luſts again: Try then thy Sanctification, by thy holy eſteem and prize of thy holy duties, which are for the encreaſe of godlineſs, and promoting of that: When thou comeſt to pray, to hear, to keep his Sabbaths, with thy thoughts full of the world, the love thereof, or delight therein, thou art no ways pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ſanctifie God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, To ſanctifie, is to have all the faculties and powers of the ſoul, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by holy principles within, and thereby carried out to do thoſe things <note place="margin">6.</note> which are holy, and after an holy manner: And thus all thoſe that are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated are wrought upon, their underſtandings are made holy, their wills holy, their love an holy love, their grief and fear holy: This is the chief mercy, above all Riches, Honors and Greatneſs; without this Sanctification, every man, though alive, is dead; though rich, is poor; though happy, is miſerable. And for the better diſcovery of it, conſider:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the efficient cauſe to which this is peculiarly appropriated; and that is, <note place="margin">1. The efficient cauſe of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</note> 
                     <hi>The Holy Spirit of God,</hi> called, <hi>The Holy Spirit,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 13. Rom. 1. 4. 2 Theſſ. 2. 13. and, <hi>The Spirit of Sanctification,</hi> becauſe peculiarly appropriated to him to work this in us: So that if thou deſireſt this Sanctification, fain thou wouldſt have a ſanctified heart, and ſanctified affections; O it troubles thee that thou art not acted by ſuch holy principles; lift up thy eyes to heaven, pray that God would vouchſafe this holy ſpirit to thee, which will work like fire, conſuming that droſs of corruption in thee. No wonder, if under much preaching, many judgements of God, people remain prophane and looſe, diſſolute in their ſins, for neither Miniſter or Angels, can infuſe this holy foundation into them. its the proper work of Gods Spirit: Take heed therefore of grieving or reſiſting this ſpirit, and that you do, when ye live in ſins againſt conviction againſt the plain declaration of Gods word; when that informeth, directeth judgeth and condemneth thee, yet thou wilt go on, and be obſtinate in thy ſins: This is the ſad caſe of many thouſands, who thereby chaſe away the ſpirit of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication from them. Now that God is more willing to beſtow his ſpirit, upon thoſe that ask him in a right manner, then any father is able, or willing to give any neceſſary good thing to his childe, appeareth <hi>Mat. 7. If ye being wicked know how to give good things, how much rather will your Father in heaven, give his ſpirit to thoſe that ask him:</hi> O then ſay, This is the neceſſary thing, this is to be ſought for in the firſt place. <note place="margin">2.

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The inſtrument of this Sanctification, the means whereby God will work it, is the <hi>Word:</hi> Thus our Saviour prayeth, <hi>That God would ſanctifie his Diſciples by his truth, his word was truth,</hi> John 17. There is no ordinary means
<pb n="384" facs="tcp:30767:212"/>
for the obtaining of this, but by the word: This is the Chariot of the Spirit, here we muſt expect its workings. As it had beed a vain thing in <hi>Naaman,</hi> to expect the cleanſing of his leproſie in anywater but in <hi>Jordan,</hi> ſo it is as fooliſh and abſurd to expect ſanctification by any humane rites &amp; inventions of men, a number of which are introduced in popery. Now as Gods ſpirit onely efficiently ſanctifieth, and not humane power or freewill; ſo the Divine truths of God are inſtituted Mediums for this glorious effect, and no other ſuperſtitious deſignments made by men: Oh then, if ever thou wouldſt be ſanctified, be a diligent hearer of the word, hear in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, as we are commanded to preach: Come to this fountain often to be waſhed in, throw thy ſelf frequently in this fire, to get thy droſs out. The effects of Gods word are admirable, eſpecially in this point, to ſanctifie thee, to make thee have holy affections, and holy principles, and holy ends and aims in all thou doeſt. As thoſe that are much in the Sun, they cannot but be much coloured by it; ſo thoſe that are in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing often, in hearing often, in praying often, they will finde ſuch an holy change upon them, ſuch admirable effects on their lives, that there will be as much wonder at them, as there were of thoſe who were dead and rotting in their graves, yet raiſed by the mighty power of Chriſt: As therefore there is no hope of that tree that is near no waters ſide, that groweth in a barren wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; ſo there is no hopes of ever being ſanctified from thoſe who ſeldom or never come to hear the word, or if they do, its out of formality, cuſtom, and with ſo much dulneſs, ſleepineſs and diſtractions, that their very outward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment manifeſts much contempt and irreverence towards God? Do theſe men come to be ſanctified? do ſuch come with this grand expectation, Of unholy to be made holy?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Meritorious cauſe, which procureth this great priviledge at <note place="margin">3. The meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe of Sanctification.</note> Gods hand, is <hi>Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> Thus the Apoſtle addeth, <hi>In the Name of the Lord Ieſus;</hi> ſo that one great effect of thoſe Agonies and Sufferings which Chriſt underwent, was to obtain Sanctification: <hi>Chriſt ſhed his blood, that he might pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe to himſelf an holy people,</hi> Tit. 3. Oh then, how ſhould this make you highly eſteem it! Was it a ſmall or a light thing for which Chriſt indured all thoſe torments? could we not be ſanctified, but by his blood? why then doeſt thou make no matter of it? where is the man that cryeth out, Oh Chriſt dyed, and yet I am not ſanctified? Chriſt hath ſhed his blood, and yet I am not made holy.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Conſider the extent of this Sanctification, its <hi>univerſal throwout:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. The extent of Sanctification.</note> 
                     <hi>I pray God ye be ſanctified throughout, in ſpirit, ſoul and body,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 3. The ſpirit, that is in the choiceſt and moſt ſublime part of a man, that needeth San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification; even theſe Heavens are defiled, this Sun hath black and foul ſpots. Hence we read of <hi>Carnal mindes, Corrupt underſtandings,</hi> and therefore we need the Sanctification of them, yea, this muſt be the firſt work of Sanctification: its your minde, your judgement, your reaſon, that is ſo great an enemy to God; What hinders, but that thou ſhouldeſt go out preſently, and give thy ſelf up unto all holy obedience? but thy minde, thy judgement is not ſatisfied, that hath this or that carnal plea; ſo that of all parts, this eye, this underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt be light, elſe all the body will be dark: Oh therefore that God would ſanctifie your mindes, your underſtandings, make them holy, then would your affections and your converſations quickly become changed. Then the next thing to be ſanctified, is the ſoul; that is, the affections and paſſions, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Interpreters think; and indeed, theſe are like the wheels in the Chariot, like the fire among the Elements; if theſe be not ſanctified, a man is carried up and down lik a ſhip in the ſtorm, without Pilot or any conduct: And beſides, theſe affections are very unruly and maſterful, therefore the ſanctification of them is more requiſite. Laſtly, there is the body, and that alſo muſt be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified; <hi>viz.</hi> Organically, as it is the inſtrument of the ſoul: Thus the tongue,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:30767:212"/>
the Eyes, the Ears, the Hands, they all are to be Sanctified. A great deal of bodily wickedneſs there is in the world, and therefore that muſt be made holy. Therefore Chaſtity, and freedom from uncleanneſſe, and whoredome, is in a peculiar manner called <hi>Sanctification,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4. 3. 4. Obſerve, you who are carried away with unlawfull, luſtfull pleaſures: Chaſtity and purity of Body from ſuch loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome courſes, is called emphatically, <hi>Sanctification.</hi> So that Fornicators, Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, Luſtfull, and Laſcivious perſons, they are in a ſpecial manner unſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied perſons; they are no more to be called Godly that live in ſuch ſinnes though they ſhould pray, hear, make never ſuch profeſſion of Religion, then darkneſſe to be eſteemed light.</p>
                  <p>Uſe, <hi>Of Exhortation.</hi> Is there ſuch a work of God as ſanctification; and is that neceſſary to every one, then look out and examine diligently whether thou <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> haſt it or no: God hath made thee, and created thee, but hath he ſanctified thee? God hath given thee riches, wealth, honour, parts, and learning, but hath he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee Sanctification? Alas the lives of moſt men, are ſo prophane, impure, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, filthy, that you cannot call them Sanctified ones, unleſſe in that ſenſe as the Hebrews call whores holy, as I told you. And this is the more to be lamented, becauſe men enjoy the means, and live under the way to ſanctification, which is Gods word. Oh that thou who ſhouldeſt be a Temple of the Holy Ghoſt, ſhouldſt be a ſwine for the divel to enter in: I intreat you to be awakened; if no ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here, no glorification hereafter: Without holineſſe no man ſhall ſee God. Why? can you reſt and be quiet till you get ſome evidences of Sanctification: be no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger bruitiſh, but men, but Chriſtians. Say, <hi>O Lord, I deſire that at laſt I may be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified to thy own ſelf, Oh ſeperate me from my wonted ſinnes, my cuſtomary ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi>

                  <p>It is true, ſuch is the ſelf-love, and ſelf-flattery in every man, that he is quickly perſwaded that he is one to whom this priviledge doth belong.

                     <hi>be ſaved?</hi> We were indeed in our Baptiſme Dedicated, and Conſecrated to God, and ſo had a kind of ſanctification. There is alſo an external ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, vouchſafed to all thoſe who are under the outward Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Ordinances, in which ſenſe Believers and their children are
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:30767:213" rendition="simple:additions"/>
called <hi>Holy, 1 Cor.</hi> 7. in oppoſition to Heathens, and unbelievers: but this is not the ſanctification in the Text, nor that to which the promiſe of glory doth belong.</p>
                  <p>Let us therefore conſider the ſigns by which we come to know who are truely ſanctified.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, <hi>They who are ſo, have the ſpirit of God effectually, and powerfully</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Thoſe that are Sanctified have the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God dwelling in them.</note> 
                     <hi>dwelling in them.</hi> That as wicked men have the Divel filling their hearts, and he reigneth in them, whereby they are carried out to all wickedneſſe, with delight and boldneſſe: Thus thoſe that are ſanctified are full of the Holy Ghoſt, being partakers of his operations, and ſo are thereby fitted for all holineſſe. Hence it is called <hi>the spirit of ſanctification,</hi> and <hi>the holy ſpirit,</hi> becauſe where the ſpirit of God dwelleth, there it ſanctifieth, and makes holy. Alas the greateſt part of Chriſtians are deſtitute of Gods Spirit; yea, they have ſcarce heard whether there be an holy Spirit or not: And thereupon they have nothing but cuſtomarineſſe, formality, and education, which do act them in all religious duties. But as in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Miracles, no humane ſtrength or power could enable them thereunto; they were onely done by power from the Holy Ghoſt; So neither to love God, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, to mortifie ſin, can be done by the ſole ſtrength of free-will: but it muſt be the Spirit of God changing and new-moulding the heart. Oh then conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this, all you who go in a round, pray and hear, and hear and pray, in a generall cuſtomary way: The ſpirit of God is not in theſe; which yet is like the ſoul to the body: like fire to the ſacrifice: like windes to the ſhip; Our duties and hearts are but Ciſterns, that is the Fountain. There is never a Duty accepted, if the ſpirit of God be not working therein, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. The ſpirit helpeth our infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and God heareth the voyce of his own ſpirit. Till therefore thou art made partaker of Gods ſpirit, all thy external righteouſneſſe and holineſſe is but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and no ſubſtance. It is an image or picture, no real life at all. Oh then, How far are prophane, diſſolute men from this Grace of ſanctification? Doth the holy ſpirit of God dwell in thee? Doth not the unclean ſpirit rather live in thee, whoſe heart and life is made like a very hell? Is it the holy Spirit of God that inciteth thee to curſe, to ſwear, to luſts? Oh blaſphemy to think, or ſay ſo. Let then all ungodly, and foul wretches be aſhamed and confounded within themſelves. It was the Divel that deſired to enter into ſwine: The Spirit of God appeared in an innocent and harmleſſe Dove: Some men are ſo far from having the Spirit of ſanctification, that they mock and deride at it, yea maliciouſly oppoſe it; but theſe are reſerved to a dreadful judgement.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Thoſe that are ſanctified, have a ready and willing obedience to the truth and commands of God:</hi> Therefore it is called <hi>Sanctification of the Spirit to Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 2. It is impoſſible to have Sanctification, and not to have a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and willing obedience to all thoſe duties that are required of us. Doth God ſay to the proud, <hi>Be humbled,</hi> if ſanctified, he obeyeth imediately? Doth God ſay to the prophane, <hi>Be ſober and heavenly;</hi> when ſanctified he yeilds immediately; inſomuch that all thoſe hearers who live in viſible diſobedience to the word of God preached, they have no evidence of their ſanctification: <hi>Obedience is better then ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</hi> God looks to that more then praying, hearing, or coming to the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances: Doſt thou ſay as Chriſt? <hi>Lo, I come to do thy will, O God, thy Law is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten within my heart.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> being ſanctified, profeſſeth his ready and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling obedience unto God: And <hi>Paul</hi> alſo, <hi>Lord, What wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Act. 9. 6. He gives his heart up to God like a blank, let God ſet down what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: As fire doth melt the tougheſt Iron, and makes it in any frame you would have it, Thus the ſpirit of ſanctification doth melt and affect the ſoul, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes cheerfully obedient in duties of the greateſt ſelf-denial, and contrariety to fleſh and blood. Oh then think not within thy ſelf, I hear thus much, I come to Church thus often; but what obedience is there in thy life? That crowneth all thy duties; that is the glory of all religion. The Iſraelites that profered thouſands
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:30767:213"/>
of Lambs, yea the children of their body were not ſo acceptable, as if they had done juſtly, and walked humbly with God: Obedience is a neceſſary fruit of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Thoſe that are ſanctified delight in the uſe of all thoſe means and excerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. Delight in Ordinances.</note> 
                     <hi>which encreaſe ſanctification.</hi> The Godly are deſcribed by hungring, and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and ſeeking, and ſo they can never have enough of holineſſe: Now the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the word is one principal inſtrument of ſanctification, <hi>Sanctifie them by thy truth, thy word is truth,</hi> John 17. It is an argument thou haſt not this ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation upon thy affections, when thou haſt no high eſteem, or price of the holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances; when this hony-combe is loathſom to thy ſtomack, full of filthy Luſts. The Godly are to call the Sabbaths, <hi>a delight:</hi> and the word is aggravated under all manner of excellencies by Davids gracious heart; and for this end, becauſe it hath ſpiritual and ſavory effects: So then if thou wouldeſt know the evidences of thy ſanctification, and judge thereby, Examine how thou art affected to the means of grace? Do they become welcome and precious to thee? Doſt thou cry out like thoſe in the transfiguration, <hi>It is good to be here?</hi> Is it as meat and drink unto thee? Then thou mayſt comfortably rejoyce in this, That God hath given thee a ſanctified heart, to love the word of God, and the means of Grace, and that becauſe of the powerful operations thereby, cannot be but by a ſpirit graciouſly wrought upon.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Thoſe that are ſanctified, are diligent in preparing and fitting themſelves for the holy duties they are converſant in.</hi> Thus to ſanctifie, was to ſet a man apart <note place="margin">4. Preparation for duties.</note> for the ſpiritual imployment he was called unto. And herein is a great diſcovery of the Truth of Grace ſeen; when men do not overly, and cuſtomarily perform ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Duties, but they do <hi>Hoc agere,</hi> as the Prieſts cryed out in the Heathens ſacrifice. Thus it is a duty to ſerve the Lord without diſtraction: 1 Cor 7. and hence are thoſe expreſſions, <hi>Watch to pray,</hi> Mark 13. 33. <hi>take heed how you hear:</hi> Mark 4. 24. <hi>Be ſwift to hear, laying aſide all ſuperfluity of naughtineſſe,</hi> James 1. 21. <hi>To pray with all thy heart, with all thy minde, with all thy ſoul, this is the fruit of ſanctification,</hi> How many need this truth to be powerfully preſſed upon them. I ſpeak not of prophane and ungodly men, who quite lay aſide the performance of any holy duties; they pray not at all, they hear not at all, or very ſeldome: but of thoſe who take upon them the profeſſion of religion; that hear and repeat Sermons, that have family Duties conſtantly: Alas it is not the doing of theſe; it is not the bare performance of theſe that argue thy ſanctification: But doſt thou watch unto theſe duties? doſt thou take heed to thy ſelf in the doing of them? Are they not diſcharged as a Task, as a burthen thou knoweſt thou art obliged unto? This is to be feared, That when God cometh to examine your religious duties, they will be found but ſo many em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pty formalities, Duties neither coming from the life of Grace, nor yet ſtirring up and encreaſing that life. Oh this is to be conſidered, That all holy duties are to come from ſpiritual life, and to ſtir up ſpiritual life; whereas the deadneſſe, the dulneſſe, the barrenneſſe of all thy private and publick duties, are a great teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie at leaſt to thy defect in ſanctification. Say then to thy ſoul, Awake thou that ſleepeſt: What? Did <hi>David</hi> pray thus? Did <hi>Daniell</hi> pray thus? Did <hi>Jonah</hi> in the whales belly pray thus? Be afraid that thou art onely Luke-warm, that thou haſt no true zeal, and ſo God will ſpue thee out of his mouth, as he threatens, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 16. Perſwade your ſelves that your heartleſſe, cuſtomary, lazy performances, are great ſinnes againſt God, have a contempt of his Majeſty upon them: and for which God doth threaten to take away the means of Grace, as from ſome of the Churches of <hi>Aſia.</hi> Oh then ſay to thy ſelf, How can this earthly, cold, lazy heart of mine ſtand with ſanctification? How can I ſay I have the love of God, and Chriſt in me, which is like fire, and do things thus coldly? Dwell upon this ſign, meditate much upon it; for how eaſily and readily doth negligence, and lazineſſe creep into all your performances; inſomuch that our duties are therefore ſo ineffectuall, and

                     </gap>moothing, and fitting of thee for every particular relation, for every good Dutie, elſe thou canſt not ſerve God thereby. It is the greateſt honour that we creatures are capable off, that we may be uſed as inſtruments for his glory. Now men may be either paſſive inſtruments, or active inſtruments under him; Paſſive inſtruments I call, all ſuch as are raiſed up by God to do his work; but they have no aim or ſpiritual inclinations to ſerve God therein. Thus <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar,</hi> they are called Gods ſervants, but their hearts were not ſanctified for God in this work. Again there are active inſtruments, and ſuch are thoſe who in the Text <hi>are made meet for their maſters uſe,</hi> they have humility, and an holy fear of God. They eye him, and look up to him; and in this ſenſe <hi>Moſes, Joſhua, David,</hi> and many others were ſanctified. If therefore God call thee to any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, if God put thee into any relation, though never ſo mean, know thou canſt not go through that relation in a gracious manner, unleſſe ſanctified thereunto, <hi>and made meet for it.</hi> Be not a blunt and unſerviceable inſtrument in Gods hand.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Thoſe that are ſanctified, are not caſt down with inordinate and ſinfull fears, becauſe of all the troubles and perſecutions that may fall upon them in doing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">7. Not caſt down with fears.</note> 
                     <hi>their duties.</hi> The work of ſanctification is accompanied with much oppoſition, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, and many difficulties: Now herein is the excellency of this ſeen, that a man is not diſcouraged for all this; he feareth to offend God by any ſin, or neglect of his duty, more then any external miſery. <hi>Sanctifie the Lord your God, and let him be your fear,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 15. Be not afraid of what terrour and troubles the world can raiſe againſt you for godlineſſe ſake; but ſanctifie God, and let him be your fear: That is, have holy, high, reverent, and great thoughts of God; look upon his name, his power, his authority, as greater then any mans. It is ſanctification onely that will make a man encounter with all oppoſitions, that will make a man fear God onely: for that puts an awfull eſteem into us of his great Name.</p>

                     <note place="margin">8. Spiritual Prieſts.</note> 
                     <hi>Prieſts, offering up spiritual ſacrifices unto God.</hi> Not that they may take upon them the publick office of preaching, and adminiſtring ſacraments, but because they have ſacrifices in a ſpiritual manner to be offered up unto God: Eſpecially that place is much to be urged, <hi>Rom. 12. 1. Offer up your bodies as a reaſonable ſacrifice unto
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:30767:214"/>
the Lord.</hi> In the Old Teſtament they did after a corporall manner ſlay and kill Beaſts, offering them to God: But now we are in a ſpiritual manner to crucifie and mortifie the fleſh, with the affections and luſts thereof. If then thou art ſanctified, all thy inordinate paſſions, and affections of anger, love, and joy, are circumciſed. As the ſacrifice of one kinde was to be wholly burnt unto God, no part to remain, ſo art thou wholly to be reſigned unto God, and all that is thine is to be given up unto him, that ſo no love may be in thee, but of God, and in reference to him; and thus of all other paſſions. Oh then if thou finde ſin, and uncircumciſed affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and motions in thee, be afraid, for the ſpirit of ſanctification is not to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in vain; where that rules and raigneth, there will be a daily killing of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly Luſts.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, <hi>Thoſe that are ſanctified, they have alſo the priviledge of Juſtification,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">9. Juſtified and adopted.</note> 
                     <hi>and Adoption, whereby they are enabled to come with boldneſſe to the throne of Grace.</hi> The ſpirit of God, which is the ſanctifier, is alſo the comforter, and it doth comfort by the fruits of Sanctification, Hence <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. The Apoſtle deſcribeth thoſe to have the ſpirit, <hi>who walk not after the fleſh, nor fulfil the luſts thereof.</hi> So that the more thou aboundeſt in ſanctification, thou doeſt alſo come nearer to conſolation; not but that the moſt holy and ſanctified ones of God, may ſometimes for gracious ends in Gods diſpenſations, be barren of all comfort, and deſtitute of joy. But becauſe joy and comfort is promiſed to the daily exerciſe of Sanctification, the righteous and the godly they are called upon to rejoyce, as being the onely and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſubjects to whom this conſolation doth belong. Therefore by wicked and unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vory words and actions, we are ſaid to grieve the ſpirit of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 30. and no wonder, if when we grieve that, that it grieveth us, or leaveth us to be grieved, and vexed by the Prince of darkneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Theſe properties being thus opened, let us conſider the grounds and reaſons why <note place="margin">Reaſons or motives to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification.</note> we ſhould ſo much preſſe after, and deſire this priviledge.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, <hi>To the ſanctified perſon, God makes all things ſanctified.</hi> Oh noble and unſpeakable priviledge; to the clean, all things become clean, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. all things work together for the good of thoſe that love God, and that is an effect of Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: What will win us and move us, if not this advantage? All things ſhall be Sanctified to thee, <hi>i. e.</hi> All things ſhall make thee holy; mercies, afflictions, comforts, and croſſes. Thus as the Temple did Sanctifie the gold, and every thing brought therein; ſo this Sanctified perſon by Gods grace, hath every thing Sanctified, health and ſickneſſe, ſtraights and libertie, life and death. Now that is the utmoſt mercy in a mercy, to have, it Sanctified; it is the higheſt thing to be deſired: Thou canſt wiſh and expect no more then this, then that the condition thou art in, the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of God which befall thee, may be Sanctified; yet this thou art ſure of, who art firſt Sanctified thy ſelf. This advantage is indeed ſpiritual, and therefore remote from earthly and worldly men, who ſo they have mercies, never care or pray for the ſanctification of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Thoſe that are ſanctified, are the onely fit and welcome perſons that may</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>come into Gods preſence.</hi> Thus in the Old Teſtament, they were to Sanctifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>when they were to draw nigh unto God:</hi> And that Typical legal Sanctification, did inſtruct concerning our Moral Sanctification. Thoſe that draw nigh to an holy God, in any holy duty, ought themſelves to be made holy. <hi>What haſt thou to do to take my words in thy mouth, and hateſt to be reformed,</hi> ſaid God? Pſal. 50. Again, <hi>I hate your new Moons, and your ſolemn feaſts,</hi> ſaith God to unſanctified perſons, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1. Remember therefore that thou art no prepared, or fitted man to approach near unto God: there is no gracious invitation of thee till thou haſt thus been ſanctified. Stand aloof off: holy duties are for holy perſons: holy men muſt draw nigh to an holy God: if God bid thee depart from him here, under a diſpenſation of Grace, How much more wilt thou hear that terrible <hi>Depart,</hi> at the day of judgement?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Therefore endeavour after ſanctification, becauſe that only anſwers really</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note>
                     <pb n="390" facs="tcp:30767:215"/>
                     <hi>to the name and title the Scripture giveth all believers, all that are baptiſed.</hi> They are called Saints, to the Saints at <hi>Corinth: The Saints ſalute you.</hi> I know many contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies are about this compellation; I touch not on them now, onely this is certain, the Title of a Saint bindes thee to real Sanctification. To be called rich, and yet poor, is but a mockery: To be accounted well, and yet ſick, is but a reall miſery: And thus it is here: To be be called holy, and yet wicked; to be ſtiled a Saint, and yet a Beaſt, or a Divel, Oh how ſhould it ſhame and amaze thee? Say then, My Chriſtianly, my Baptiſme, my Religion doth oblige me to this Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. I have onely a Title, if I have not true holineſſe. So that all you who live in groſſe ignorance, and ſcandalous waies, What ſhall I term you? How ſhall I name you? Art thou fit to be called a Believer, a Saint? Yet I ſpeak not this, as if the Scripture called none Saints, or holy, but ſuch as had internall Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Be therefore ſtirred up to this, becauſe this is better then all knowledge, parts and abilities.</hi> Oh that men who look at religion, would minde this more. <note place="margin">4.</note> This is the will of God, your ſanctification, follow after holineſſe or Sanctification, without which no man can ſee God. Thou thinkeſt it a great matter to be able to repeat Sermons, to diſpute in matters of religion: Oh but it is better to ſpeak five words from a principle of Sanctification, then five thouſand from parts and intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual abilities only. Oh then ſay, if I pray, I preach, I diſpute, I repeat, and have not Sanctification; I am but a tinckling cymbal that makes a pleaſant noiſe to others, but it ſelf is not affected therewith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe of Exhortation,</hi> ſtill to be moved and preſſed hereunto. Oh the comfort and glory of being in the number of thoſe that are Sanctified: I may add one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> more, this is the onely evidence of your Election, of Juſtification, of right to eternal glory. Here a man muſt begin; If I be ſanctified, then I am elected, then I am juſtified. How then can you have any comfort? How is it that you are not full of fears and troubles, that finde no tokens of ſanctification upon you, but the clean contrary. Sanctification, it is the end of all our preaching, and of your hearing; and therefore every thing hath been in vain to you till this be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. Do not then rejoyce any more that thy riches have encreaſed; that outward mercies have abounded; but ſtill look to this, Art thou ſanctified? Yet after you have heard Sermon after Sermon, How prone are you to go home the ſame men? Not neighbour to ſay to neighbour, How may we do that we may be Sanctified.</p>

                     <bibl>1 COR. 6. 11.</bibl>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>YOu have heard the nature and properties of Sanctification: Now let us diſcuſs the counterfeits of it: for there are many things in Chriſtianitie which people do generally truſt in, as if they had power to ſanctifie them, in the mean while neglecting wholly true and real Sanctification. This point is of great conſequenco, if men would diligently attend to it: For as it was generally received among the Jews, that the Temple &amp; Sacrifices did ſanctifie them, though their lives were ful of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe: So there is ſcarce any one Chriſtian, but thinketh his Baptiſme, his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, the Goſpel, theſe do ſanctifie him. And as among the Jewes, this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ingraffed in their hearts, was that bitter root which made all things elſe bitter; ſo it is now among Chriſtians. Let us go over in particular thoſe abuſed inſtruments for ſanctification.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, <hi>There are and have been many ſuperſtitious humane cuſtomes introduced, in the zealous performance of which men, have thought themſelves ſanctified.</hi> Theſe <note place="margin">1. Zeal in Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms.</note> things have abounded in Popery: Inſomuch that all the holineſſe almoſt they cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate and commend, is this external holineſſe. Hence their holy images, holy veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, holy Altars, holy Croſſes, holy Water, and a world of ſuch Conſecrated things they have, in the devout uſe whereof they conceive themſelves made more holy. The accumulating and heaping of theſe conſecrated ſanctities, were brought in partly by an ignorant zeal to imitate the Jewiſh diſpenſations, as alſo a deſire to ſymbolize with Paganiſh rites: and partly for to ſatisfie the ambition and avarice of their holy Mother, the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> And if we conſider the generall igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and ſuperſtitious diſpoſition in moſt people, It may ſeem a wonder of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, that ever ſuch a reformation could be brought in, as ſhould take people off from their accuſtomed ſuperſtitious ſanctification. But God calleth things that are not, as if they were: Now although I hope there are few that hear me, but have learnt better then to be addicted to ſuch conſecrated holineſſe, yet take theſe antidotes againſt it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That if the inſtituted conſecrations, and ſanctifications in the Old Teſtament,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Antidotes. I.</note> 
                     <hi>and that by God himſelf, did not upon the meer uſe of them, or the work done, beget reall, and morall ſanctification; much leſſe can meer humane inſtitutions, introduced ſolely by the will of man.</hi> Now that it was ſo in the Old Teſtament, it is plain. We read of many purifications, and ſanctifications; They had holy veſſels, the holy Temple, the Prieſts Garments were holy; yet none of theſe inſtituted holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes did make the prieſts or people better; though they had holy Oyl poured on
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:30767:216"/>
their bodies, yet if they were not anointed with the graces of Gods Spirit, all was nothing. Though they came to an holy Temple, yet if their bodies were not an holy Temple, this profited them not; and no remiſſion of ſin could be obtained by the killing of Sacrifices. If then Gods own Conſecrations did not make perſons inwardly, and in their lives ſanctified, How can we think that holy places, holy Oyl, holy Water, or holy times that have no Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall, but from Mans preſumption, ſhall be able to work ſuch effects in us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Theſe can have no ſuch ſanctified operation, becauſe not appointed by God;</hi> and where there is no Divine inſtitution, we may not expect any Divine operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <note place="margin">II.</note> 
                     <hi>In vain do they worſhip me, teaching for Doctrines the Traditions of Men,</hi> Mat. 15. 9. <hi>In vain,</hi> Oh what a Thunderbolt is this; Who can perſwade the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious man, that hath laboured and toiled himſelf in ſuch ignorant and formall Devotions, that all is but labour in vain? Why might not men appoint Sacraments, and adde more to thoſe two Chriſt left us, if ſo be that they could appoint any Uſages or Rites, which would work ſuch effects?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>It argueth a people of a Divine and Noble diſpoſition, when they enquire into</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">III.</note> 
                     <hi>the Originall, and Divine inſtitution of things.</hi> Hath God put his ſtamp and ſeal upon ſuch a Cuſtome? Is there a Divine ſuperſcription upon ſuch a religious Rite? This would be like pulling off the ſcales from the eyes, and make them weary of <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkneſſe. The Hebrews call Idols ſometimes by a word that ſignifieth Terrors and Fears, becauſe the Worſhippers of them did excruciate themſelves by a thouſand of ſuperſtitious fears about them. And thus alſo are all the Traditions of men, perplexing the conſciences of men with endleſs ſcruples; whereas a true know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God out of his word, ariſing in the heart of a Man, would like the light quickly diſpel this darkneſſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>It is a dangerous thing to depend on theſe things for ſanctification, becauſe they fill the heart with opinions of merit, ſatisfaction, and compenſation made to God.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">IV.</note> Hence where theſe Cuſtomes are introduced, there the Doctrine of Merits and Free-will, and of humane ſatisfactions, are vehemently aſſerted: Now the main ſcope of the Scripture is to pull down this pride of mans heart, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptie him of all righteouſneſſe and worth; to make him to ſee Chriſts fulneſſe, and his emptineſſe. Oh, How farre was <hi>Paul</hi> from thinking of any ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, or Compenſations, who admireth that Evangelicall Grace ſo much vouchſafed unto him a moſt grievous ſinner! The Godly heart cryeth out with the Centurion, he is not worthy Chriſt ſhould come within his roof.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>The work of this externall adherent holineſſe is very eaſie.</hi> It is no greater <note place="margin">V,</note> labour or trouble to beſprinkle themſelves with ſo much Holy water, to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oynted with ſo much Oyl. If this were all that Chriſt required of thoſe that would be ſaved, hell would be emptie. But to what purpoſe are conſecrated Croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Sannctified Beads, if thy tongue, and eyes, and whole bodie be not alſo ſanctfied. The Papiſts they give this reaſon, why ſo many turned Proteſtants, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (ſay they) Proteſtantiſm chalks out an eaſie way to heaven, it is but Believe, and all will be well: but Popery holds out a more pleaſant and ſutable way to fleſh and blood; for what burthen is there in heaping up many Ceremonious and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious actions? The mortifying of one ſin, the crucifying of one Luſt, will be more heart-ache and trouble to fleſh and blood, then a thouſand ſuch Traditio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſervices.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Well then, it may eaſily be granted, <hi>That ſuch petty ridiculous ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctities that are by mens commandments, may be no more then dung, yea, an abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the Lord.</hi> But what ſhall be thought of thoſe holy Duties which God hath appointed: there is holy praying, holy hearing. Theſe holy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evies which God himſelf hath Commanded, Doth not the conſtant, and
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:30767:216"/>
diligent uſe of theſe ſanctifie a Man? No, theſe are not barely to be relied <note place="margin">How the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent uſe of Gods Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, do not ſanctifie. I.</note> upon.</p>
                  <p>For 1. <hi>Theſe duties do not ſanctifie, except thou be firſt ſanctified inwardly.</hi> Prayer doth not make thee holy, but an holy prayer proceeds from holineſſ. Theſe duties do then onely encreaſe, and adde to our Grace, when they are the exerciſes and effects of a ſanctified life within us. A wicked man who is ſpiritually dead in his ſins, can no more pray after a ſpiritual gracious manner, then a dead man can ſpeak or breath. Do not then miſtake in this buſineſſe: theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Duties are called holy, not becauſe they ſanctifie every one that appeareth near to God in them; but becauſe God, who is the object of them, and on whom they are terminated, is an holy God, and becauſe they encreaſe holineſſe in thoſe who are endued with a ſupernatural life.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>God in the Old Teſtament doth ſeverely rebuke all thoſe that draw nigh to Him</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">II.</note> 
                     <hi>in thoſe duties he commanded, and yet refuſe to be waſhed from their ſins.</hi> This is the main ſcope of all the Prophets in all their Sermons, upbraiding, and complaining that they would approach to him, as if they were his people, in a very ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: <hi>They would hear, yet do nothing,</hi> Ezek. 33. 32. And thereupon God diſdaineth their Duties; God accounts of them no more then as heathens, and the vileſt of men: And do we not need ſuch Prophets again, to awaken our people? May not we ſay? The burthen of the Lord? the burthen of the Lord. To what purpoſe are thoſe multitude of Duties? Waſh ye, and make ye clean, and ſo will God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you. What a ridiculous thing is it to comfort thy ſelf with an holy prayer, as thou thinkeſt, when thou haſt ſo many unholy words, and unholy actions? will God take notice of thy duties, when thy ſins cry ſo loud in his ears? but we have ſpoken heretofore of this.</p>
                  <p>We come to the Third thing intended, <hi>And that is the holineſſe of the Covenant</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. The being exreanally in Covenant with God, how it Sanctifies, and how it doth doth not ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie a man.</note> 
                     <hi>under which all paſſe that outwardly profeſſe God to be their God, and accept of Jeſus Chriſt to be their Lord.</hi> This is the higheſt holineſſe next to that of Sanctification, and true Godlineſſe: Now becauſe this is a controverted point, and many who confeſſe an outward Covenant-holineſſe that was Typical among the Jews, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny any ſuch federal holineſſe in the New Teſtament, and therefore ſay all the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the Goſpel, is a Moral real holineſſe; we muſt be the more tender what we deliver herein.</p>

Now what tongue can expreſſe the priviledge, and great glory of this condition, to own God for our God; ſo that thereby his wiſdome, his power, his goodneſſe, all is for our advantage; and we come in all duties unto God, not upon abſolute terms, but Covenant terms, and that of Grace: Where by God doth as it were lay aſide the glory of his Majeſty, and his terrible ſevere juſtice and becomes like one of us, condeſcending to us?</p>

How was that? not really and in truth; for then he could never fall into that unpardonable ſin: but externally and in reſpect of the outward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of the Goſpel, with their profeſſion of obedience thereunto. And hence it is, that the Apoſtle writing to all Believers, to all Churches which he had plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he giveth them the title of Saints: eſpecially we are to take notice of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, 1 <hi>Cor. 1. 2.

As for the exception that ſome make, he ſpeaks thus in reſpect of the better part. I grant that to be true in part; yet becauſe the other did not wilfully renounce Chriſt, they might in ſome ſenſe be ſaid to be ſanctified; for they voluntarily owned that holy profeſſion and name of Chriſt, though in works they denyed him.

There is none of you who are Baptized, and own the title of Chriſtians, but ye have entred into a Covenant with God, you have promiſed to be his, you have reſigned up your ſelves unto him, as your Lord, whoſe Laws you will obey.

But all this will not avail without true, reall, and practicall holineſſe, and amendment of thy life.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>This holineſſe is but titular and nominal;</hi> and although it be of ſome dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity <note place="margin">I.</note> and priviledge, as it was to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> to have the Oracles and promiſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them; Yet it is not advantagious to the chiefeſt and moſt neceſſary good, which is the enjoyment of God, and eternal happineſſe.

There were in the Primitive times extraordinary gifts vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed by the Holy Ghoſt, according to the promiſe of old, <hi>Ioel</hi> 2. Now all theſe were from the ſame ſpirit, as the Apoſtle witneſſeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4. And although thoſe extraordinary works of the Holy Ghoſt now ceaſe, yet there are many gifts ſtill diſpenſed unto men, that cannot be called the works of the ſleſh, but the gifts of Gods Spirit; ſuch as believing for a ſeaſon, joy in the word preached: illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of mind, taſting experimentally the ſenſe of Gods word, in which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaith, <hi>They are partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, Heb.</hi> 6.

may be light, but no oyl; and therefore though it be our ſaying ordinarily; Such an one is an able Chriſtian; VVhy ſo? becauſe of gift in Praier, abilitie to ſpeak in divine things; yet that is not ſo. He is an able Chriſtian, who is ſtrong in the works of Sanctification, who is able in believing, in heavenly mindedneſſe, in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, in uprightneſſe and ſincerity of heart. If ever the Profeſſors of <hi>England</hi> nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded any truth, they ought to give diligent heed to this: For how is that which is indeed true godlineſſe neglected, and curious Diſputes, and needleſſe Controverſies exalted in the room thereof!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Theſe doe not ſanctifie; becauſe a man that hath theſe gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, is ſtill carnal and unſavoury, improving them wholly to carnall and <note place="margin">2.</note> corrupt ends. It's commonly objected by <hi>Arminians,</hi> and others, when we ſay, That an unregenerate man is wholly fleſh, and altogether corrupt: and yet may have many gifts of Gods Spirit: how then can they be wholly corrupt? Are thoſe gifts of God evill? and its anſwered, The men are altogether corrupt and carnall, though ſome good gifts of God be in them; for they improve all theſe to a ſinfull end, for ſelf-advantage one way or other; even as they doe the external Gifts of God, Riches, Honour and Glory: ſo that as by theſe they are not made holy, but their corruptions are more drawn out by them: So it is here, they are not made holy by theſe Gifts and inlargements, but rather internall and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruption is more ſtrengthened thereby, But I have ſpoken at large, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon gifts of Gods Spirit are no evidences of grace.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond doubt therefore may be, what a true godly man, who is indeed ſanctified, ſhould doe, when he findes no evidences of his ſanctification. All <note place="margin">II. What a truely ſanctified man ſhould doe when he findes noevidences of ſanctification.</note> the Sermons he heareth preached about it, put him into fear and tremblings of heart: for alas! he goeth home, and looketh in his ſoul, compareth himſelf and the ſymptomes and properties of ſanctification together, and O the diſproporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he preſently diſcovers! Inſomuch that he hath little joy in himſelf, and none know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth but his own ſoul, what ſad temptations, and heavy anxieties of ſpirit he lyeth under.</p>
                  <p>To Anſwer this: Firſt, it cannot be denyed, but that even a ſanctified perſon <note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> may be in great darkneſſe, and heavy blackneſſe of ſoul, that he cannot but judge himſelf for the preſent to be a Reprobate and a Caſt away; to be an hypocrite, and all that he had done, in hypocriſie. <hi>David</hi> ſometimes caſteth forth deſpairing words in his Pſalms about his condition, as if he had no hopes of God: <hi>Heman</hi> the Pſalmiſt complains of the terrors of God, that made him even diſtracted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 88. 15. This is no new thing, for a child of light to lye and walk in darkneſſe; for a child that is heir to a great inheritance, to be in the dark cloſe womb, knowing nothing of it. God hath wiſe ends in this, both in reference to the perſons themſelves, that are thus exerciſed, to humble them, and to keep them low; as alſo to teach wicked men, that if Godly men be thus ſcarcely ſaved, where ſhall the wicked appear? Although wicked men for the moſt part ſuck poiſon hence; and God maketh this an heavy ſtumbling-block to them; that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the contrary, as if it were godlineſſe, and the too much following of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and the means of Grace, made them ſo. But oh miſerable deluded ſouls, to fall at ſuch ſtones, and to harden themſelves in wickedneſſe by that, which ſhould indeed humble them. But to direct the tempted ſoul in this matter: Firſt he muſt give up himſelf to the inſtruction and information of others, who are godly and wiſe; for he being in a temptation is not fit to judge, nor can he paſſe righteous judgement. A man in the dark cannot ſee his face in the glaſſe, nor in muddyed and turbulent water. Thou art ſick, and we ſee Phyſicians themſelves, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo wiſe, will yet hardly venture to be their own Phyſicians in dangerous diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but require the aſſiſtance of others; Chriſt himſelf had an Angel to help him; The ſame word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, in the Scripture is both to exhort and comfort, becauſe comfort is not received in a gracious heart, but by frequent and daily exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Doe not then regard thy own thoughts, and thy own determinations. Its
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:30767:220"/>
ſaid <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtaggered not through unbelief, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 20. That implyeth, that there are temptations, which doe as it were give a man a great blow in the head, making him dizzy and ſtaggering. Now as a man in ſuch an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected blow knoweth not what he doth, nor underſtandeth himſelf; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth a Chriſtian in ſuch temptations. Remember therefore thy ſelf in this black condition: Say, I am not wiſe enough, nor able enough to judge my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Art thou in doubt about thy condition? conſider whether there be not ſome great ſin committed, and unrepented of, that doth juſtly provoke God <note place="margin">2.</note> to caſt thee in this darkneſſe. This was <hi>Davids</hi> caſe after thoſe foul enormities; then he could not tell what to ſay, or think of himſelf. This <hi>David</hi> inſinuateth when he prayeth ſo earneſtly for truth in the inward parts, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 51. Wonder not then if ſuch foggy miſts raiſe ſo great a darkneſſe, that it obſcure the very Sun. Thou deſireſt impoſſibilities; thou wouldſt have evidence of ſanctification, when its evident thou doſt not mortifie thy ſinnes; Therefore repair that crack in thy building, that leak in thy Ship. <hi>David</hi> in another Pſalme 32. ſpeaketh alſo that he had no quietneſſe in his bones, till he had confeſſed that ſinne which troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him. Doe not then deceive thy own ſoul; till thou haſt put that <hi>Dalilah</hi> away from thee, never think to enjoy the joy of the Lord, which is thy ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It may be thou doſtnot diſtinguiſh between the preſence of Grace, and <note place="margin">3.</note> the power of it; between weak graces and ſtrong graces. And that which is little, or which is not to thy deſire and mind, thou accounteſt nothing at all. A little infant hath a mans nature in him, as well as he that is grown. As it was in the building of the Temple, they were not to deſpiſe the day of ſmall things; ſo neither is a godly man to contemn or diſregard the beginnings, and the ſmall things of grace. Our Saviour would not deſpiſe the ſmoaking Flax, and wilt thou? Take <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of thinking thou haſt no evidences, becauſe they be imperfect and weak: One ſpark argues fire as well as an whole flame. The child of God while he looketh to the rule, and conſidereth what he ought to be, never remembers that the conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to this rule is more or leſſe in thoſe that believe; ſo then though thou art in the loweſt form, yet thou art ſtill in Chriſts ſchool, and needeſt to look backward for what hath been done, and fore-warn'd for what remaineth to be done.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, remember the evidences thou haſt enjoyed formerly. This is a ſpecial <note place="margin">4.</note> way to keep the heart up againſt all aſſaults. The time hath been when thou didſt walk in the comfortable demonſtrations of grace in thy heart and life. The time was, when light did ſhine into thy breaſt and thou couldſt with much thankfulneſſe acknowledge the good things God wrought for thee; let not then the preſent darkneſſe obſcure all former light; live by the remembrance of what thou haſt felt, if thou canſt not by any preſent ſenſe and experience; for if ever thou haſt upon good grounds diſcovered thy ſelf to be in the ſtate of ſanctification, thou are ſtill: whatſoever thy preſent fears may be to the contrary, God is the ſame, Chriſt and the promiſe continue ſtill the ſame. Think then of thoſe Bottles of tears thou haſt filled, and remember it was once day, though now it be night, and it will be day again.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, lay down this alſo for a true and comfortable rule, That if thou canſt <note place="margin">5.</note> not finde ſuch marks of grace, yet if there be earneſt deſires and ſtrong groans af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe, there is grace begun in thee. Theſe ſprouts cannot be, but where ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is. Hence it is, that thoſe who <hi>hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſſe</hi> are ſaid to be bleſſed, becauſe they ſhall be ſatisfied, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. Though therefore corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are potent, they bear thee down, earthly affections, immoderate paſſions are prevalent over thee; yet becauſe thou panteſt and breatheſt after more grace, this is an argument of ſpirituall life in thee. <hi>Paul</hi> that complained of the Law of ſinne within him, found alſo the life of Grace within him; ſo that as long as thou doſt not willingly give up thy ſelf to ſin, and obedience to the luſts thereof, here is no
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:30767:221"/>
matter of dejection, but incouragement, <hi>Paul</hi> and others have in this manner been exerciſed.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, If thou haſt no comfort from ſanctifying grace, then make the more of juſtifying grace. God many times hides thoſe works of his in us from our own eyes, <note place="margin">6.</note> that ſo we may the more eſteem his grace without us. The hungry will prize the Honey-comb, and the ſick the Phyſician. Thoſe that ſit in darkneſſe, they long for light. Thus <hi>David,</hi> when he was in many ſad and ſpirituall exerciſes, gets into this Ark, in the midſt of thoſe waters that did over-flow. There is a time when God wil put a chriſtian to the life of faith, and make dependance and adherence the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt honour a Chriſtian can bring to him; and this is moſt eminently ſeen, when to his own ſenſe and feeling he is a barren Wilderneſſe; the ſenſe and diſcovery of grace in us makes much indeed for our comfort; but dependance on the promiſe and adherence to it, even while we are ready to ſink and to be damned, is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt honour to God.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Conſider this alſo, that as the heart is very deceitfull in a preſumptuous man, flattering him upon falſe grounds to believe in God; ſo its as deceitfull in a <note place="margin">7.</note> tempted Chriſtian to make him doubt of all things, fear all things, to regard his ſins onely, and not his graces. How prevalent the deceit of heart is in Phariſaical men, is evident to all the world; for how confident and bold are ſuch? When have they any fears or doubts about their condition? When doe they ever ſay, It may be all this is but a ſmooth skin, no ſound vitals at all? But in a godly man tempted, there his deceit worketh in a contrary way, not taking notice of the great things God hath done for his ſoul, he believeth, and mourneth for ſin, he would not commit any known ſin for all the world, yet at the ſame time cannot ſee the uprightneſſe and ſinceritie of his heart: Say then, I have a deceitfull heart in my fears and doubts, as well as preſumptions.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, Know this alſo, That it is a great and grievous ſinne to deny the works of God in us, to betray the uprightneſſe and integrity of our hearts. You ſee <note place="margin">8.</note> 
                     <hi>Iob</hi> ſtands like a ſtrong Oak againſt all the vioſent blaſts that are upon him: He is a man outwardly and inwardly afflicted, and that by extraordinary judgements from God, which made his godly friends conclude, that certainly he was an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, God did not uſe to give ſuch extraordinary blowes, but where there were great faults: now ſee how reſolute <hi>Iob</hi> was in all this, <hi>He would not part with his integrity till he dyed, Iob</hi> 27. 5. As there is nothing wherein the devill doth more deſire to ſhake thee, than in the integrity and truth of thy grace; ſo in this thou oughtſt to be the more peremptory, and its no preſumption; but great unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, not to acknowledge Gods gifts in thee. Beſides this is a bearing falſe witneſſe againſt thy own ſelf, not in matters of goods or life and death, but everlaſting peace and comfort.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, Though thou ſit in never ſo much darkneſſe, not knowing what to doe or think, yet humble thy ſelf under Gods hand, give not way to fretting impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <note place="margin">9.</note> entertain no hard thoughts againſt God and his proceedings: Say, O Lord, if I ſhould never ſee good day in this world. O Lord, though thou ſhutteſt me up in a priſon and dark Dungeon all my life time, that I can never get out, yet I may not expoſtulate with thee; my heart muſt not ſwell or fret; for it is thou (Lord) that doſt it. Thus if we would follow <hi>Peters</hi> Exhortation, <hi>To humble our ſelves under his mighty hand, then he would exalt us, 1 Pet.</hi> 5 6. It is indeed very hard to rebuke thoſe roarings of the ſoul, to quiet thoſe tempeſts and waves; we ſee what ſad effects they had upon <hi>Iob.</hi> Into what horrid paſſions he breaketh out; and when he was reproved for this, (O ſaith he) <hi>if your ſouls were in my ſouls ſtead, you would doe as I doe.</hi> Well, the ſtouter the Adverſaries are thou grappleſt with, the greater honour it will be to conquer; if it be a <hi>Goliah,</hi> then <hi>David</hi> will be more exalted.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if thy temptations be thus violent, that as hitherto thou art perſwaded thou hadſt no grace, yet from this time begin; it is not too late now: If God will
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:30767:221"/>
call thee in at the heat of the day, refuſe not to labour in the Vineyard. While thou art fearing and doubting about thy condition, the day is ſpending, and night is coming on; ſo that though thou ſhouldeſt grant, that all which hath been done by thee, hath been in Hypocriſie, and on falſe grounds; yet now begin to lay the firſt ſtone in a good foundation: Say, O Lord, Let all theſe fears, all theſe doubts be ſanctified to me, to make a ſure work: <hi>Qui nil dubitat, nil diſcit</hi> He that doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of nothing, will never ſeek out to learn; and it may be well for thee that God hath ſhaken thee thus, it may be to make the root ſtronger; There may be a clearer calm after theſe boiſterous troubles.</p>
                  <p>This may ſuffice to comfort thoſe who ſtand thus ſuſpended from God, and caſt <note place="margin">III. Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to thoſe who find San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification in them but in a low degree.</note> like <hi>Abſolom</hi> from <hi>Davids</hi> face. What incouragements may be given to that Chriſtian, who findes indeed Sanctification in him, but in a low degree, he is a Babe, a child, not a grown man: now to ſuch an one, no comfort ought to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred, ſo as to make him ſit ſtill, that he ſhould have a <hi>nil ultra.</hi> No, <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, who ran like the Sun ſwiftly fulfilling his race, Phil. 3. <hi>yet forgets what is behind, and makes faſt on to what is before:</hi> ſo that to grow in grace is a neceſſary duty, and we ought to be carryed on to perfection, <hi>Heb</hi> 6. Yea it many times may give ground of ſuſpition to Gods people, whether they have grace in them, or no; becauſe they are at ſuch a ſtand: yea not ſo well, but ſometimes in decayes and great dulneſſe; ſo that if the increaſe of riches add to the deſire of them, how much rather ſhould the increaſe of grace ſtill provoke thee more and more? But yet thou art not without many grounds of hope and comfort.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, In that God hath beſtowed the leaſt degree of ſanctification upon thee, <note place="margin">1.</note> he hath done more unto thee then if he ſhould give thee all the glory and honour of this world. To be rich in faith, though poor in the world, is better than to be rich in the world and poor in faith. Oh then with what thankfulneſſe ſhouldſt thou admire Gods goodneſſe to thee? Hath he given thee but this little Muſtard-ſeed of Grace? Hath he but begun this great work in thee? This is happier and more excellent than all the outward advantages of the earth. Its a woeful thing to have our portion in this world. As <hi>Iſmael</hi> had many great gifts, but <hi>Iſaac</hi> had the inheritance; ſo it may be God gives thee great outward abundance; but as for the ſpiritual inheritance, that he giveth to others: rejoyce then, and be excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding glad, all you who find but the very firſt fruits of this happineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The promiſe of juſtification and pardon is made unto the truth of <note place="margin">2.</note> Grace, not to the meaſure and degrees of it: The little hand of a Child, may hold a Pearl, as well as a Giants hand; ſo that though thou haſt not as much grace and godlineſſe as a <hi>Paul,</hi> or a <hi>David,</hi> yet thou maiſt as comfortably apply the Covenant of Grace to thy ſoul, as they did. Its not, he that beleeveth thus much ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>but he that beleeveth,</hi> John 6. 35.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Thou who art weak, yet ſeeſt this and be waileſt it, haſt this advantage, <note place="margin">3.</note> which a ſtranger hath not, to walk more humbly, to depend more firmly and ſtrongly upon Chriſt. Sometimes great Cedars, as <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> fall fouly, when leſſe ſhrubs ſtand ſtill. The more eminent a Chriſtian is, the more danger he is in, of pride, and ſelf-confidence, and thereupon they fall more fouly; but the little child, that is afraid to go, will not let the Mothers hand go, is kept from falling.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The weaker thou art, in ſome reſpects God hath the more care and <note place="margin">4.</note> tender reſpect over thee. Chriſt will not <hi>quench the ſmoaking Flax,</hi> Mat. 12. 20. The husbandman is moſt careful of his tendereſt plants; <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, Nature hath put it into parents to have moſt love to their youngeſt and weakeſt children. Thus God takes thoſe that are weakeſt, and giveth them more conſolations and the greater ſupport.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, There is no Chriſtian ſo weak, but he may ſome way or other doe God <note place="margin">5.</note> much ſervice: and this he ſhould comfort himſelf in, as the greateſt honour he is capable off. The Apoſtle often uſeth this ſimilitude of a mans body, and ſheweth
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:30767:222"/>
how that though one part be more noble than another; yet even the moſt ignoble hath its proper uſe, the body knoweth not how to be without it: The eye cannot ſay to the foot, <hi>I have no need of thee;</hi> yea, the Apoſtle exhorts all, <hi>That they ſhould eſteem of every man better than himſelf, Rom.</hi> 12. Even the meaneſt Chriſtian doth in ſome thing or other exceed a ſtranger.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> Be exhorted to this great duty and priviledge of Sanctification. If there be any honour, any happineſs, any excellency, it is in this: Thou art not fit for any <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> holy duty, for any religious approach unto God, without Sanctification. Thy Chriſtianity, and the doctrine of Chriſt obligeth thee unto it. This is the proper and peculiar benefit that is in Chriſts Church. There is no holineſſe among Heathens, no Sanctification without the Church of God: well, though now thou art a prophane deſpiſer, and it may be an oppoſer of holineſſe, yet one day it will be in requeſt, when Riches, Honour, Greatneſſe will do thee no good. Conſider, this is the will of God, your Sanctification, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 3. All the commands in Scripture drive to this, they tend to this; If thou art not holy, thou haſt no right to happineſſe, to have an inheritance among them that are ſanctified. <hi>Acts</hi> 26. 18. Holineſſe is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed under the Goſpel to be in a large meaſure. <hi>Zech.</hi> 14. 20, 21. Every Veſſel ſhall have Holineſſe unto the Lord: An excellent Promiſe to be improved by us.</p>

For the better opening of the words upon which I intend to build this diſcourſe, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve God himſelf inditing a Sermon for <hi>Ezekiel</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet to preach, wherein there is, 1. The Doctrine, <hi>I have no pleaſure in the death of a wicked man.</hi> 2. The confirmation of it by an Oath, which God himſelf makes, <hi>As I live, ſaith God.</hi> 3. The uſe of Exhortation, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye.</hi> 4. The Motive, <hi>Why will ye dye?</hi> For the occaſion of theſe words, you may ſee God giving Commiſſion to <hi>Ezekiel</hi> to be a Watchman, admoniſhing him by ſeveral Arguments to diſcharge his truſt faithfully; and in that all Miniſters are concerned: It was <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> wonder, if any ſpiritual Officer, who had charge of ſouls committed unto him, could be ſaved; for if a man is not able to give an account for his own ſins, how ſhall he do it for others? Therefore the forepart of this Chapter, ſhould be the faithful Miniſters Looking-Glaſs, wherein he ſhould often look: And if there be ſo much joy in heaven, for the reducing of one ſheep that goeth aſtray, how much
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:30767:223"/>
rather for the converſion of a wandring Shepherd! Another part of his duty is, to vindicate and juſtifie God; for the Jews quarrelled and repined at Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as if his <hi>ways were unequall,</hi> or as if God did delight in the deſtruction of men, yea, though they turned from their wicked ways. Now my Text is an Apology unto that calumny, where the clean contrary is confirmed by an oath of God himſelf; who though he cannot lye, and ſo his word is enough, yet for condeſcenſion to our capacity, and to confirm our faith, doth ſwear, <hi>That he delights not in the death of a wicked man. O beatos nos quorum cauſâ Deus jurat, O miſerrimos ſi nec juranti Domino credimus,</hi> Tertullian.</p>
                  <p>Now this Text is frequently urged and debated upon in the matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, corrupt Teachers concluding from hence, that there is no Election <note place="margin">4.</note> or Reprobation abſolutely, becauſe God doth ſeriouſly will every mans life, and no wicked mans death. Some anſwer, that this place is wholly impertinent to that queſtion; for (ſay they) the Prophet ſpeaks not here of eternal death, but tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and that which is by the violence of the ſword: And (ſay they further) the antecedents and conſequents do evidently ſhew, that the ſenſe is, God doth not will the death of a wicked man, if he will turn from his wickedneſs; for the Jews charged God fooliſhly, as if they were puniſhed unjuſtly, for they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded themſelves they turned to God, and yet their calamities were not taken away: This is probable; but grant the Text to be comprehenſive of Eternal death, as many other places are; ſuch as that, <hi>God would not have any to periſh, but to come to the knowledge of the truth, &amp;c.</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 4. Then the anſwer is known, which may eaſily be made good, though it be not my work now, God hath an approving will, and an effective or decreeing will. Gods Approving will is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out to the objects, as good in its ſelf; but Gods Effective will is, when he intends to bring a thing about. God had an approving will, that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould ſtand, therefore he gave him a command, and threatned him if he did fall; yet he had not an effective will, to make him to ſtand, for then who could have hindered it? Thus Chriſts tears over <hi>Jeruſalem (How often would I have gathered thee, and thou wouldſt not?)</hi> were not Crocodiles tears (as ſome ſay the Calviniſts make them) for though Chriſt, as God, had not decreed the converſion of the Jews, yet the thing it ſelf was approved of and commanded, and he as the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the New Teſtament, affectionately deſired it: So here in the Text, God by this pathetical expreſſion, doth declare, how acceptable and deſirable a thing it is in its ſelf, that the Jews ſhould be converted; how diſtaſtful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant their damnation was: therefore mark the expreſſion, he doth not ſay, I do not will the death of the wicked, but <hi>I have no pleaſure in it:</hi> And if that of the <hi>Arminians</hi> be true, that God doth effectually will the converſion of all, why then are not all converted? <hi>Who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> but I intend grapes, and not thorns; practical, not controverſal matter from this Text.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Obſervation is, <hi>That the damnation and deſtruction of a wicked man, is unpleaſing to God, its not that which he delights in.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Before I open the point, you may object one known and evident place (there being many others alſo equivalent to it) <hi>Prov. 1. 26. I will laugh at your cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi>

                  <p>To Anſwer this; Both theſe are true, <hi>God delights not in the death of a ſinner,</hi> yet <hi>He will laugh at their Deſtruction:</hi> For if you conſider death and hell, as <note place="margin">Anſwer</note> the ſinners miſery meerly, and as ſin brings it, ſo it is diſpleaſing to God; but as it is an act of juſtice puniſing the impenitent for his wickedneſs; ſo it is well pleaſing to God, for he is juſt as well as merciful. Even as a juſt Judge that condemneth a malefactor, may pity the man condemned for his crimes, and the execution be grievous to him, as its the mans miſery; yet as he is a juſt Judge, ſo he delights alſo to have juſtice done: but this is handled in controverſies</p>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Gods unwillingneſs to damn, is ſeen in the original and primitive inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Arguments to prove the point.</note> 
                     <hi>and creation of man:</hi> He made him after his own Image; indued him with all ſufficient power and ability to perſevere: There was no ſpot, or blemiſh, or defect in him, onely he was mutable, and might Apoſtatize from this happy eſtate, if he would: Seeing then God withheld nothing from him, that might make him happy; and in him he covenanted with all mankinde, intending the like good to them; hence it doth appear, how well pleaſing it was unto God, that man ſhould continue in a ſtate of holineſs before him: <hi>Sin then came into the world, and by it death through Adams voluntary tranſgreſſion:</hi> There was no Antecedaneous decree from God, neceſſitating him to ſin: It was his own willful choice, and that when he knew the penalty to the contrary; but yet ſo, that Gods permiſſive decree of his fall, did precede, though not neceſſitating: If therefore ſin had been inbred in mans heart at firſt, as it is now ſince his fall, then the cauſe would have been imputed to God; but then he had that priviledge of power to do that which is good, and to withſtand what is evil.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Gods unwillingneſs is ſeen, even ſince mans revolt;</hi> For whereas he <note place="margin">Reaſon 2.</note> might have dealt with us as the lapſed Angels, who are left without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, he hath appointed an Ark to ſave ſome Righteous perſons. There was never ſuch offers and tenders to Angels, as here in the Text, <hi>Turnye, turnye, why will ye be damned?</hi> Now the means God hath appointed for a mans recovery are divers: <note place="margin">I. The means God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for mans recovery.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>There are means by way of love and goodneſs: There are alſo means by way of Chaſtiſements and afflictions. By way of Love;</hi> How winning and overcoming ſhould that be? Love doth ſurround thee; its love that thou liveſt, that thou breatheſt; its love, thou art preſerved from hell and damnation; its love, that thou haſt any ſupport at all; therefore the goodneſs of God in all the Creatures thou enjoyeſt, ſhould lead thee to repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. The Sun that ſhines to thee, the Earth that brings forth fruit for thee, the health and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the ſenſes, ſhould melt thee always into good. Again, becauſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally we are ſlaviſh, and ſo moved rather by judgements then mercies; ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther driven with whips, then drawn with ſilken cords of love; therefore God leaveth not that way unattempted alſo: Hence the Prophets are ſo diligent in informing the Iſraelites, what was the cauſe of their plagues, famines, the ſword and captivity, even their ſins; and therefore they ſhould not be ſo much weary of them, or cry out of them, as of their iniquities: <hi>God doth not puniſh willingly,</hi> ſaith the Scripture, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. like the Bee that naturally gives honey, but ſtings not, unleſs provoked. As the Phyſitian doth not willingly put his Patient to torments, but for his good: Thus it is here, God ſeeth all his love upon thee will do thee no good, thou doeſt abuſe it, and grow wanton under it, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he will take another courſe, he will throw thee ſometime into the water, to ſee if that will get the filth out of thee; ſometime into the fire, to ſee if that will fetch the droſs out: If therefore God would leave thee incurable, he would let thee alone, and puniſh thee no more, as he threatens ſome, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 4. 14. O then know, there is never a mercy, or an affliction, never a ſmile from God, or frown from him, but he will have an account of it: How hath it made thee weary of thy ſins, and willing to repent?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The means God hath appointed, are either external or internal.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, <note place="margin">II.</note> are the Scriptures, and the preaching of the word of God. As where the Sun ſhineth, that is to give light and life; ſo where the Goſpel ariſeth, that is to beget ſpiritual and ſupernatural life: The word of God therefore, and the preaching thereof, is compared to all effectual and energetical things, to
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:30767:224"/>
Muſterd-ſeed, to Leaven, to a Sword, to an Hammer, to Fire: Now why doth God cauſe this noiſe always to ſound in thy ears, but becauſe thou ſhouldſt hearken and be obedient? It is true indeed, we muſt diſtinguiſh of wicked men; they are either ſuch as live in Paganiſm, in the ignorance of God, and without the Church (though God hath not left ſuch without a teſtimony and a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs their conſciences within, and the creatures without, bearing witneſs of God) yet we cannot ſay, that God ſo immediately wills their ſalvation, as of others, ſtill keeping to the firſt diſtinction we mentioned, and not contradicting that: Why indeed God ſhould thus differently diſpenſe the means of grace to ſome, and not to others; yea neglect the far greater part of mankinde, is a myſtery too deep for us to wade in: Gods ways are always moſt juſt, when they are moſt ſecret and unknown to us; yet even of ſuch deſtitute perſons, we may ſay, <hi>God hath no pleaſure in their death,</hi> according to our premiſed ſenſe; for he giveth them warnings againſt ſin, and implanted a thouſand witneſſes within them, to accuſe them if ever they do evil: or ſuch wicked men, who live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſound of the trumpet, that are awakened, and reminded every day of their tranſgreſſions, to ſuch as theſe God diſcovers, how unwilling he is, that they ſhould periſh in their impieties. Conſider therefore, that every leaf in the Scripture, every Sermon thou heareſt, will be a terrible matter of account at that dreadful day: God will ſay, How often would I have converted thee, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed thee, but thou wouldſt not! Then there are internal means, of which anon.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Gods pleaſure in the converſion of wicked men is ſeen, by thoſe patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and affectionate expreſſions, which we ſee the Scripture uſeth;</hi> which do not <note place="margin">Reaſon 3.</note> onely argue Gods will, but the height and ſtrength of his will: As here in the Text; Firſt, Gods Oath, <hi>As I live (ſaith God;)</hi> then the ingemination of the duty, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye;</hi> laſtly, a vehement expoſtulation, <hi>Why will ye dye?</hi> So you may read many times in the Scripture thoſe exclamations, <hi>Oh that my people were wiſe, that they would conſider their latter end;</hi> and we ſee Chriſt himſelf, though in the midſt of all that pomp and glory which was attributed to him; yet weeping over <hi>Jeruſalem, Oh that thou hadſt known the things that belong to thy peace, &amp;c.</hi> Luke 19. 42. The truth of this alſo will further be amplified, if you conſider what zealous and importunate Meſſengers his Prophets are: <hi>We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you, and intreat you to be reconciled unto God,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 20. <hi>If ye will not hear</hi> (ſaith <hi>Jeremy) my ſoul ſhall mourn in ſecret for you,</hi> Jer. 13. 17. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of theſe things, with an abſolute Election, in the ſenſe that the Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox maintain it, and not which their adverſaries calumniouſly faſten upon them, See in Controverſal Writers.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>That the death of a wicked man is diſpleaſing to God, appeareth, in that ſin, which is the cauſe of death, is the onely evil hated by him, and that onely which</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Reaſon 4.</note> 
                     <hi>he hath decreed to puniſh to all eternity: Thou art of purer eyes, then to behold ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> Hab. 1. and, <hi>God is angry with the wicked every day:</hi> He that commands us to hate it, how much rather muſt he himſelf loath it? God therefore is not the author and lover of ſin; for <hi>Non eſt author ejus, cujus eſt ultor,</hi> He is not the Author of that of which he is the Avenger: How then can God delight in thy damnation, when the cauſe of it is ſo abominated by him! Indeed (as you heard) ſeeing damnation is an act of Juſtice, and ſo hath the nature of good, God doth delight in it; but as it is ruine of the creature by ſin, ſo it is not accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him.</p>
                  <p>Fiſthly, <hi>Gods unwillingneſs that the wicked ſhould periſh, appeareth in thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal means, and inward works of Gods Spirit, that are vouchſafed to many:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Reaſon 5.</note> God thinks it not enough to give the word, and the ordinances, and thus out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to knock at the door; but he alſo opens the door in ſome meaſure. Hence come thoſe convictions of Conſcience, thoſe illuminations of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and many ſuch ſecret motions of Gods ſpirit, that if poſſible, the
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:30767:224"/>
ſoul might at laſt bewail its ſins, and turn unto God. Its true, thus far God doth not go with every one, neither are all admitted unto ſuch favor, but many within the means of Grace, have their hearts thus continually beaten upon, and their conſciences thus convinced and ſmitten: And therefore ſuch who ſhall yet retain their natural pravity and wickedneſs, when ſo many remedies ſhall be applyed, argue the greater obſtinacy, and judgement of God upon them.</p>
                  <p>Now to all this, there is one grand and main Objection; which is, If God <note place="margin">Object.</note> do thus will and delight in the converſion of men, If thoſe invitations are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and ſo pathetical, Why then doth not God change the hearts of all? why are not all converted? why are any damned? <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this there is a true Anſwer and a falſe Anſwer returned: The falſe Anſwer is by <hi>Arminians</hi> and others; Therefore ſome are converted and not others (ſay they) becauſe ſome do receive the grace of God offered, and not others: But this is to put all the glory of mans converſion upon his own will; for why do ſome receive the grace of God, and not others? Can any receive grace, without the help of grace? Muſt there not be ſupernatural life breathed into a man, before he can ſtretch out his hand towards God? beſides, this oppoſeth all thoſe places of Scripture, which deſcribe man dead in ſin, and unable to any good; and converſion is not the awakening of a man aſleep, but the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of one that is dead: Therefore the true anſwer is, that although God hath revealed his approving will thus, about the ſalvation of ſinners; yet the Scripture doth plainly limit his effective will, to thoſe that are elected, not to all men, but to ſome, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. there this queſtion is on purpoſe handled, and the Apoſtles concluſion is, <hi>On whom he will, he ſheweth mercy, and whom he will, he hardens,</hi> And doth there ſilence all thoſe cavils, that proud ſinners may make; even this very Objection he inſtanceth in, <hi>Who hath reſiſted his will?</hi> So that you muſt compare one Scripture with another, and be ſure to keep ſobriety and humility in this great myſtery, not lanching further into this Ocean, then the Scripture is a ſtar to guide you in.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though God doth thus will the ſalvation of ſinners, yet he is alſo a God of Soveraignity, and Power: None may preſcribe to him; he is of boundleſs <note place="margin">2.</note> Wiſdom and Counſel, and none can ſearch out or know the depths of God, but the ſpirit of God. How many things doth the Scripture reveal, as objects of faith, which cannot be comprehended by us; that are above all humane reaſon, though not contrary to ſound reaſon! Our Saviour hath taught us an excellent way to reſolve theſe diſpenſations of God, <hi>Even ſo Father, for ſo it pleaſeth thee,</hi> Mat. 11. As <hi>Ipſe dixit</hi> muſt be the ground of faith; ſo <hi>Ipſe voluit</hi> of our ſubmiſſion.</p>

                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Of inſtruction, concerning the inexcuſeableneſs of wicked men, who <note place="margin">Uſe. 1.</note> periſh in their ſins; Who may be blamed but thy own ſelf? Although we have it from <hi>Adam;</hi> to lay our ſins off from our ſelves, yet theſe fig-leaves will not cover our nakedneſs; for to God thou canſt not impute thy ruine: <hi>O Iſrael, thy perdition is of thy ſelf,</hi> Hoſea 13. 9. <hi>Let no man ſay, when he is tempted, that he is tempted of God, for he tempts no man, but every one is led aſide by the luſts of his own heart,</hi> James 1. Oh thou! that in this life time ſlattereſt thy ſelf, thy ſins muſt not be owned by thee, none may put thee in minde of what thou art; when God ſhall at the day of judgement, diſcover all hidden things of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, then it will be manifeſt, thou, even thy own ſelf, haſt undone thy ſelf: God hath done like a gracious, good, juſt and merciful God, but thou haſt been a cruel enemy unto thy own ſoul, <hi>Qui voluntatem Dei ſpreverunt invitantem, voluntatem Dei ſentient vindicantem,</hi> You ſhall finde his power in puniſhments, who have deſpiſed his grace and mercy in offers thereof, <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Neither may you excuſe your ſelves, by caſting your ſins on Satan; for although he be a Tempter, and doth continually ſuggeſt corrupt luſts unto thy heart; yet this is onely by temptation, by ſuggeſtion; he doth not make thee ſin, whether thou wilt or no: Thou art ſtubble, and that makes the ſparks of fire which come from

him, ſo eaſily inflame. As ſome Heathens have imputed their miſcarriages to I know not what, Fate, and the conſtellation of Stars; ſo many Chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, put their iniquities off either to God or the Devil: What would you have them to do? they cannot help it; How could God puniſh and damn thee for theſe ſins, if he cauſed them in thee? God indeed hath a juſt and terrible pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence about the ſins of men, he is not an idle ſpectator of them, but yet he doth not infuſe any wickedneſs into men; <hi>that</hi> they have of themſelves, onely God may guide and order it to wiſe ends, and cauſe it to run down what chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels he pleaſeth.</p>

What excuſe haſt thou? Conſider, that God deſireth thy converſion, who doth not need thee, who can be honored though thou art damned in hell: he can raiſe up children to <hi>Abraham</hi> out of ſtones: When therefore God ſhall thus invite thee for thy good and advantage onely, he is not bettered by thee, nor made the more happy, then thy forehead muſt be braſs, that doth not bluſh at ſuch ingratitude; cry out, Who am I, Lord? what am I, that I ſhould be regarded? wilt not thou have praiſe, and honor, and glory, though I be a caſt-away? why ſhould my life and ſalvation be ſo dear to thee, who am naturally a curſed enemy to thee?</p>

                     <q>Say unto them, As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that he turn from his way: Turn ye, turn ye from your evill wayes.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THis Text hath informed us how unpleaſing the death of a wicked man is to God. We now proceed to the inference made from that propoſition, <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wicked ſhould turn from his evill wayes. Turn ye, turn ye.</hi> The inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination denoteth the vehement affection and deſire of God, as alſo our ſtupidity and love to our ſins, when once calling will we not awaken, but we muſt over and over again be called upon. I am therefore now to treat on that famous and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary work, converſion or turning from ſinne. As Satan and the Angel did once ſtrive about <hi>Moſes</hi> his body, So now the great controverſie between God and his Angels, and the Devil and his inſtruments, is about a wicked man, whether he ſhall ſtill be kept in the bonds or chains of ſinne, or whether he ſhall be looſened from them, and ſet free to walk in Gods Commandements. I ſhall, becauſe of the uſefulneſſe of this point, handle it doctrinally, and practically. And the foundation upon which we will build our diſcourſe ſhall be this Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That converſion or turning, from our evill wayes, is neceſſarily required</hi>

                     <hi>to an happy and eternall life.</hi> The Text hath this in the affirmative and the contrary, Let the wicked man turn, that he may live. <hi>Turn ye, Why will ye dye?</hi> See how life is the neceſſary conſequent of Converſion, and death the fruit of neglecting it. Life and death are the great Arguments in the world. What will not a man give for life? and death is the King of terrors. We uſe to ſay, ſuch a man is ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and buſie in that matter, as if life and death depended on it. To be ſure, ſuch ought your cares, prayers, and endeavors to be about the avoiding of ſin, and cleaving to that which is good; for life and death are in theſe things. Oh that men by faith and an effectual Meditation would apply theſe things more.</p>
                  <p>For Introduction into this matter, conſider ſome particulars.</p>

                        </gap>hings;</hi> ſo God is ſaid to turn joy into laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to turn the captivity of <hi>Sion:</hi> unto <hi>Perſons,</hi> and ſometimes it is applyed to <hi>God,</hi> when of angry he becomes loving and propitious unto <hi>men,</hi> when they leave their luſts, and turn to him, both are comprized in this Text: <hi>Turn unto me, and I will turn unto you.</hi> Turn unto me by an holy change, and I will turn to you by a gracious change, though all the change be in man, not God. The Texts of Scripture which command and commend this converſion are ſo many, that it is end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:30767:226"/>
to name them; ſo then as bodies, are ſaid to have ſuch a locall poſture, (as for example) a man may ſtand with this poſture, as to have his back upon the Sun, and his face clean contrary to it; Thus it is with the ſoul, the affections of the ſoul are its feet, and when it turneth from God, the back is turned upon the Sun; and in that poſture he continueth, till by faith and repentance he be turned again. Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore in what poſture thy ſoul is, whether thou art not clean oppoſite to God and his way. As naturally we came into the world, with our faces towards hell, and our backs upon God; ſo it is with our ſouls.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>As by ſinne we are thus turned from God, which is</hi> terminus a quo, <hi>ſo the Creature, and the luſts of ſin are the</hi> terminus ad quem, <hi>to which they turn.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion <note place="margin">2.</note> is a motion; Now in all motions, there is the term from which, and the terme to which. Thus in the motion of the ſoul to ſin: The term from which, is God; the term to which, is ſin: and the contrary is, when we turn to God; ſo that if there were no other arguments, this might eaſily perſwade us to come out of that cuſtome and delight in ſin, which we have been uſed unto; for how reaſonable and happy is the change, to leave ſinne, that hath guilt, torment, condemnation, and all curſes in it, and to turn to God, the fountain of all happineſſe and joy! Oh, we might think, that all the violent temptations of ſinne, ſhould never be able to hold us, but that we would quickly break all thoſe bonds, and run to God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>This phraſe of turning to God, and from ſin, implyeth thus much, That while we live in ſinne, we make ſinne our Lord and Maſter;</hi> and therefore follow <note place="margin">3.</note> that, turn up and down after that, as the Servant after his Maſter: but when we caſt off theſe tranſgreſſions, then we follow the Lord our Maſter, and go after him; ſo that all men in the world are divided into thoſe two ranks, either they are ſuch as goe after their luſts, turn after them, as the ſhadow after the body, or elſe ſuch as cleave unto the Lord, and as the herb <hi>Heliotropium,</hi> turneth up and down after the Motion of the Sun, ſo doe they in obedience and affections after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of God. Now this ſervice and obedience to the luſts of the fleſh, is a tedious and toilſome life indeed, though to the corrupt heart it may ſeem other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden,</hi> Matth. 11. 22. A man that turneth into the way of ſin, is like a traveller that ſhould turn into a way full of Quick-ſands and Bogs, and dangerous Precipices, having alſo a ſore and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable burden on his back, preſſing him down with exquiſite pain.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, ſin is a connatural and ſutable object to their depraved affections; and ſo they ſwallow down ſin, which is like honey in the mouth, though it prove Gravel in the belly. Oh then that all wicked men would have thoſe repenting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, as the Prodigal, <hi>I will leave my Husks and Swine, and riſe, and return to my fathers houſe.

                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>This Converſion unto God, as it implyeth ſin putting us into an averſion from him; ſo alſo it ſuppoſeth ſlight and contempt, which every wicked man puts upon God.</hi> For to turn the back on a man is an action of ſcorn, and diſdain. Thus God complaineth, <hi>They turned the back upon him, and not the face, Jer.</hi> 32. 33. All ſin hath in it a contempt of God; for it is the turning the back on God. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though every ſin doth not formally, and expreſſely intend ſuch a diſdain and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of God; yet interpretatively, and in truth it doth ſo. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith, that contempt and contumely doe more provoke an ingenuous man than reall oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. When God would aggravate <hi>Davids</hi> ſin, he calleth it, A Deſpiſing of him. Oh then that wicked men would lay this more to heart! Thy ungodlineſſe and wickedneſſe thou liveſt in is ſo much ſcorn and contempt offered unto God, its tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the back on him. Now for thee a poor ſinful Creature, who haſt all thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:30767:226"/>
from God to put contempt on him, how unſufferable is it? and the greater the contempt is, by how much baſe and more ignoble thy luſts, are to which thou turneſt. To prefer the Devill before God, to regard his temptations more than Gods Promiſes; What arrogancy, and impudency is this? Did the Devill creat, thee, doth he preſerve thee, did he dye, or was crucified for thee? Then if thou art ſo many wayes obliged, and ingaged unto God; yet for thee to prefer the Creature, yea the Devill before God; how unjuſtifiable is it?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Becauſe by ſinne we are thus averſe from God. The further we go on in ſinne, and the more progreſſe we make in thoſe wayes, the farther off ſtill we are from</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>God, and our turning back to him will be a more difficult thing.</hi> The Prodigal went into a far Countrey, ſpiritually as well as corporally: He went far from God, and therefore his return would coſt him dearer: ſo that this ſhould make every man ſtop betimes in the way of his ſinning; this ſhould make him without any delay return to God: for every day thou goeſt farther, and ſtill farther from him; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou ſhalt return to him, thy task will be the harder. Oh it is ſeldome ſeen, that a man who hath all his life time been in motion and travell from God, ſhould at laſt bethink himſelf, and reſolve to go back to God, from whence he fell. As <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid of the Heathens noble and admirable actions of morality, which he called glittering ſins, That the faſter they learn, the more they were out of the way; This is true of all wicked men, the greater haſte they make in this world, and the more dayes they live, the farther off are they from God: thou art farther off from ſalvation, than thou waſt many years agoe. A ſad thing it is to conſider, that the longer thou liveſt, the leſſe hope of thy Converſion; the more time thou haſt ſpent in this world, the further off from happineſſe. Be not then worſe than the Horſe, or the Mule, for a Bridle in their mouth will ſtop them, and turn them out of the way: But though the Scripture put many Bridles in thy mouth, give thee many curbs to keep thee from ſin, yet thou wilt violently ruſh on. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle could ſay of ſome, <hi>Their ſalvation was nearer than at firſt, Rom.</hi> 18. but we may of many, Their damnation is nearer.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, <hi>This Converſion, and turning unto God, is in Scripture ſpoken ſometimes as</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>our work, and ſometimes as Gods work.</hi> Thus in the Text, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye.</hi> And again, <hi>Make ye a new heart, and a new ſpirit:</hi> But in other places, its made the peculiar gift of God alone. Thus God ſaith, <hi>He will take away the heart of ſtone, and give an heart of fleſh,</hi> Jer. 31. Ezek. 32. So, <hi>He will circumciſe their hearts, He will give them a new heart, &amp;c.</hi> Now how can theſe be reconciled? If God doe it, how can man? If man, how can God? Can it be Gods gift and our work too? Now there is returned this anſwer by erroneous Teachers, that (ſay they) from thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces its plain, our Converſion is partly from Free-will, and partly from Free grace, though Gods grace be acknowledged to be the principall: The one teacheth Gods operation, the other our co-operation. Thus they do not exclude God totally, yet they make him onely a co-partner with us in this work of converſion: But this is quickly diſpelled, by thoſe places that deſcribe man <hi>dead in ſinne;</hi> and ſo can be no ſynergiſt with God: as alſo by thoſe Texts which give the praiſe and glory of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion totally and ſolely to God, not dividing this glory between him and the Creature, no more than divine worſhip, of which God is ſo jealous, that he will have it alone.</p>
                  <p>The true Anſwer therefore lyeth in this; That the former kind of places of our duty and obligation, what we ought to doe; They are not a meaſure of our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er what we can do. When the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye;</hi> He doth not here declare what we are able to do, but what we ought to do; and yet this is not in vain, becauſe by this we are convinced of our impotency, and are humbled under our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity; and withall God makes this a practical command to turn us: Even as that word at firſt, <hi>Let there be light;</hi> or that of Chriſt to <hi>Luzarus, Lazarus come forth;</hi> and the latter kind of places they argue the work of Converſion to be wholly of God, in which we are ſubjects receiving; not agents co-working. This is to be
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:30767:227"/>
underſtood in reſpect of the initiall working of Grace; for this phraſe, <hi>Turn ye,</hi> doth alſo imply that we act and work; being firſt acted and wrought upon by God; <hi>Actiag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>mus, &amp; hoc bene agimus, quod a bono agamur.</hi> So that to ſpeak properly, turning to God, or converſion, is not ſo much that work of grace infuſed in us, which we receive, as <hi>Adam</hi> had the breath of life breathed into him; but its the actual motion and turning of the ſoul, which floweth from the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>: So that this is <hi>rectus ſecundus,</hi> the other is <hi>actus primus,</hi> as they ſay. Hence a man is not ſaid to turn to God, becauſe he hath the habits and principles of grace, but becauſe they are actuated, and by them the ſoul doth move to God, as is more largely to be ſhewed. Thus then you ſee how thoſe places are conſiſtent together.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>This Converſion or turning to God, is either the firſt Converſion, or the latter.</hi> The firſt Converſion I call that, when we are at firſt tranſlated from the <note place="margin">7.</note> ſtate of darkneſs to glorious light; when at firſt we are taken off the bitter root we were in, and ingreffed into the ſw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>et Olive-tree. The latter converſion is that when upon fals, or ſins committed, we have in ſome meaſure turned from God again, but afterwards return. Thus <hi>Peters</hi> recovery is called a converſion, <hi>Luke 22. 32. When thou art converted ſtrengthen thy brother.</hi> And thus when the Diſciples fell into p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>d and contention, our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Except ye be converted, and become like little children, ye cannot enter into the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi> Mat. 18. So that although there be but one main fundamental converſion, or turning to God, yet ſeing every ſin, eſpecially thoſe that are more foul, do turn remarkably from God; therefore even converted perſons need dayly to be further converted. Do not therefore reſt in this, that thou art once converted, thou canſt remember the time and inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it; but conſider, there is a daily converſion, and turning to God requiſite; Thou art to be converted from thy daily pride, daily hypocriſie, daily guile of ſoul, diffidence in the Promiſes. Some think, becauſe of that great work, and remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able change God once made upon them, that therefore they may ſay, <hi>Soul take thy eaſe, for thou haſt much good laid up for thee, and think to be cloathed in all glory, like the L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                        </gap>es, that neither labour, or spin;</hi> but the word of God tels us, that there are daily corruptions remaining, from which we muſt conſtantly turn away.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, There is a two fold Converſion. <hi>The one from Heatheniſm and Paga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm or Hereſies, to the true Faith and Doctrine of Chriſt: The other not o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ly from</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">8.</note> 
                     <hi>that, but alſo from ungodlineſſe and impiety in our lives.</hi> Now though the one be much admited, yet the latter is the chief of all. We ſee by the preaching of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles many thouſands were converted; but many of theſe were Hypocrites, and loved the world and their luſts ſtill. Therefore they were onely converted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the faith of Chriſt, not to obey his holy laws and commands. Thus ſome are ſaid to <hi>Turn from their Idols to the living God,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1. 9. But if they did not leave their ſins, and their carnal confidences, which were as ſo many Idols, they found no advantage. Therefore diligently mark this; Its a light matter to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from Heatheniſm, Hereſie and Popery, ſo as to come to acknowledge the Truth; but art thou alſo converted in thy heart and affections, to ſubmit to, and willingly obey the Lawes of Jeſus Chriſt? This is all in all.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly; <hi>Therefore in the laſt place; As every part and faculty of the ſoul and body hath been averſe from God, ſo Converſion must be in them all.</hi> The mind muſt <note place="margin">9.</note> turn from its vain, ignorant, blinde, and unbelieving thoughts and imaginations: The will muſt turn from its obſtinacy, perverſneſſe and diſobedience: The heart and affections from their unlawfull objects they were placed upon; and from all this exceſſe, violence and immoderacy: for want of theſe comes that partiall and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Converſion to God ſo often condemned in the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> Oh then ſit down and think, Lord, every thing within me is averſe to thee, there is nothing but is turned from hee Oh then vouchſafe thy Grace, which will make all within me turn to thee; minde, heart, affections, and all my might: you will find that true Conver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

So that if there be no knowledge, there is no hope of any turning to God; therefore <hi>Laodicea</hi> is counſelled to buy eye-ſalve, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. 18. as that which would be the firſt means to help her; and this Prayer is ſtill to be continued, for thoſe whoſe converſion we deſire, <hi>That God will give them eye-ſalve:</hi> Its ordinarily ſaid, As God in the firſt Creation wrought light, before other things; ſo in man, who by nature is a miſerable Chaos and confuſion, God cauſeth light to ſhine out of darkneſs. The bruit beaſts are not capable of converſion, becauſe they have no reaſon; and although our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be naturally corrupt, and ſo a great enemy to God, yet there is by it a paſſive capacity, though not an active of converſion. Hence the Goſpel at firſt did take the beſt and moſt glorious effects in cities, where men were bred up in more knowledge and underſtanding: It's true, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Not many learned are called,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. and, <hi>God chooſeth the fooliſh things of the world, to confound the wiſe;</hi> and our Saviour Chriſt giveth thanks to God, <hi>That he had hid the things of ſalvation from the wiſe, but revealed them to babes:</hi> But by Wiſe and Learned, are meant
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:30767:228"/>
ſuch, that with their learning are alſo pufft up with pride; and by babes, were not meant thoſe that have no knowledge or underſtanding, but that are lowly and weak, comparatively to others: Howſoever, where converſion comes, it giveth light and knowledge, if there were none before. The conſideration of this, ſhould much ſtartle and amaze many of you, for how woful and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table is the ignorance of moſt? how little is known about original and actual ſin, which is their diſeaſe? and how little about Chriſt, who is the Phyſitian? <hi>God would have all men to be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the truth,</hi> 1 Tim 2. The knowledge of the truth muſt be firſt attained; and on the contrary, <hi>Its a people of no underſtanding, therefore he that made them, will not ſave them,</hi> Iſa. 27. 11. Chriſt told the woman, <hi>If thou hadſt known the gift of God, and who it is that ſaith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldſt have asked of him,</hi> John 4. 11. <hi>If thou hadſt known;</hi> and this we may ſay to thoſe, who lie ſtill in the dungeon of their ſins, If thou hadſt known what thy condition is, what the curſes of the Law are, how terrible God is, how few ſhall be ſaved, and ſuch like, thou would<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t not ſtand idle, as thou doeſt, but like the Hart, pant after the blood of Chriſt, as that after the waters: Oh then that God at laſt would perſwade ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of their damnable eſtate. To whom is the word without profit? to whom is it a ſavor of death, but to ignorant people? Where may the Miniſters make their ſad complaints, They have labored in vain, and none believe their report, ſo much, as where this darkneſs, this night is upon mens hearts? You old men then, that know nothing, that underſtand very little, why are ye not afraid, being you are in ſuch darkneſs? and you fathers, whatſoever you fail in, fail not here, about inſtructing your Children, though you cannot leave them wealth and eſtates, yet let them have the knowledge of God out of the Scriptures: How much would it affect you, to have children bodily blinde? would you not heal them, if you knew any remedy in the world? but to your childrens ignorance and ſpiritual blindeneſs, you are voluntarily acceſſary, and you willingly are the cauſe of it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Men far from converſion, are ſuch as have a Phariſaical Self-conceit</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Men that have a Phariſaical conceit of their own righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</note> 
                     <hi>of their own Righteouſneſs and good Works;</hi> by which means, they never think of going back, for none can perſwade them, but they are in the right way already: This is a generation, that will ſooner dye in their ſins, then ever turn to God; and our Congregations have ſuch, as well as the former. Obſerve our Saviours Sermons, and you ſhall finde, that he did leaſt good, upon thoſe that iuſtified themſelves; inſomuch, that he tells them, <hi>Publicans and harlots entered the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven, before ſuch as they were;</hi> and again, <hi>I come not to call the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but ſinners to repentance,</hi> Luke 5. 32. ſo we preach, not to convert thoſe who think themſelves Righteous already, who applaud themſelves in their good Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities, or plauſible lives; but to thoſe who are convinced of their ſinfulneſs, and groan under it: I know it is a very unpleaſing thing for a man, to be found a ſinner, to judge himſelf and condemn himſelf upon that account; he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſit down with a falſe, dawbed peace, and cozen his own ſoul, then arraign and terrifie himſelf after that maner; but it is a vain thing to hide and exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate, when we have to do with God; we muſt judge our ſelves, elſe God will judge us. It was the Churches bold preſumption, that would at laſt deſtroy her, to ſay, <hi>She was rich, and clothed, and wanted nothing, when indeed ſhe was miſerable, and naked, and wanted all things;</hi> yet in ſuch a fooliſh Paradiſe do many place <note place="margin">Rev. 3. 19.</note> themſelves, They be converted, they become changed, they are as good as any others already, they have as good an heart as any other: Theſe men are moſt incureable, and are in the greateſt danger, becauſe they feel no danger: O then know, That quietneſs and ſecurity which thou haſt in thy breaſt, and all that <note place="margin">3. They who have been long accuſtomed to ſin.</note> confident preſumption in thee about thy ſelf, will at laſt be like the cobweb, not ſerve to cover thee, when the tempeſts of Gods wrath ſhall ariſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>They have but little hope of converſion, who have been long accuſtomed
<pb facs="tcp:30767:229"/>
to ſin, whoſe iniquities for many years together have been taking a deep root. If a Blackamoor may change his skin, then may you do good, who have been accuſtomed to evil,</hi> Jer. 13. 23. Hoſ. 9. 9. <hi>When Iſrael had deeply corrupted themſelves, then God would remember their iniquity.</hi> A man that hath been a long while given to his luſts and ungodlineſs: Oh who can give hopes that ever he will turn to God! Take heed then of cuſtom in any ſinning, it is like a milſtone about thy neck, it will, like <hi>Pharoah,</hi> oppreſs thee, and keep thee down, that thou mayeſt never leave <hi>Egypt.</hi> The Devils that poſſeſſed a man from his youth up, were more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultly caſt out, then any others: The husbandman hath little hope of a crop in ſowing, when the ſoil hath a continual wont to miſcarry. Cuſtom in ſin, makes men like the tall grown Oaks, which cannot be removed, they have got ſuch deep hold in the earth; whereas at firſt ſin is more timorous, and leſs impudent, the conſcience of a man is not ſo hardened: A continual uſe in ſin, takes away all the ſense and feeling of it, all the horridneſs and terror of it: Thus men that are accuſtomed to curſing and ſwearing, they minde it not: Men given to luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and filthy ways, have no horror upon them, after their unclean practices; and why? cuſtom is like a great ſtone laid upon a man, already dead and buried in the grave of ſin: And therefore a ſinner, habituated in an evil way, is compared to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who was dead and buried, and even putrified ere he was raiſed again.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Thoſe that have enjoyed the means of grace for a long ſeaſon, and yet are bryars and thorns:</hi> Theſe give little hopes of converſion. The ground that <note place="margin">4. Thoſe that have had the means of grace a long ſeaſon, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ungodly.</note> hath often received rain, and brings forth nothing but weeds, is nigh unto curſing, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 7. Thoſe that refuſed the Prophets, <hi>The duſt of their feet was to be ſhaken off, in teſtimony againſt them,</hi> Mat. 10. 14. The word of God doeth moſt good, and hath the greateſt effects, at its firſt coming to a place; as you may read in the ſeveral plantations of the Church at firſt, whereas the longer men live under it, the authority and majeſty of the word is abated: <hi>Ye did for a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon rejoyce in his light,</hi> as our Saviour told the Jews concerning <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> John 15. 35. When God hath ſent his Miniſters and Prophets one after another, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing, inſtructing, and vehemently exhorting and charging you, to part with your luſts, ſaying, You cannot have them and Chriſt too; you cannot hold them an heaven too: Its a ſad preſage, (and yet thou hardeneſt the neck againſt all theſe reproofs) that Chriſt hath ſaid of thee, as of that fig-tree, <hi>Never fruit grow more on thee.</hi> As there are ears of corn that are blaſted, that never thrive, or come to any good; ſo there are many blaſted ſinners, impenitent and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, which after many remedies applied, yet continue under the power of their diſeaſe: O then, conſider how much this concerneth you! you may by your unfruitfulneſs and barrenneſs under the means of grace, make your converſion leſs poſſible, then that of Pagans and Heathens. Did not our Saviour ſay? Mat. 11. 21. <hi>That the Tyrians and Sodonians would have ſhewed more effects of a converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then the Jews to whom there had been ſo much preaching, if God would have vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed the Goſpel to them?</hi> Certainly you are in a more dangerous eſtate, then any people that ſit in darkneſs, and have no light: If ſo many Sermons, ſo many Sabbaths, ſo many Exhortations, have done no good? who can but think it is in vain to plant and water any more?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Thoſe that have accuſtomed themſelves to rebel againſt the light, and to live againſt the convictions of their conſcience:</hi> As the Mariner uſed to ſtorms and <note place="margin">5. Thoſe that have accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to rebel againſt the light.</note> tempeſts, is not afraid; ſo theſe continually uſed to the whips and ſcourges of their conſcience, at laſt are not afraid at all, yea, quite put it out: The Apoſtle calls this <hi>A cankered conſcience, ſeared with an hot iron,</hi> 1 Tim. 4. 2. or <hi>Quite cut off,</hi> as ſome expound it; and certainly, this muſt be a deſperate preſage: for ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing converſion is let into the ſoul, by that needle of conviction; if this be reſiſted, and continually beaten back, what hope is left at the bottom? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this is the inlet to the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, from which never any
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:30767:229" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was, or ſhall be converted, of whom if we had certainty, we might no more preach to their converſion, then to the Devils and damned in hell. But whence comes this impoſſibility of turning to God? it aroſe at firſt from rebelling againſt light, living in thoſe ſins, which the ſpirit of God convinced thee of by the word, and ſo in ſome meaſure, <hi>Doing deſpite unto the Spirit of Grace:</hi> This makes thee at laſt inſenſible; even as frequent walking barefoot, brings a ſenſeleſneſs of pain upon the feet: Now whether this light be natural, ingrafted in thy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; or ſupernatural, revealed by the grace of God, it is a woful hardneſs, to reſiſt any of them: This indiſpoſition to converſion, is very common; for what man is there, that liveth in groſs palpable ſins, that doth not rebel againſt his conſcience, and rebel againſt the light of Gods word: Oh! this muſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, thou haſt deviliſh wickedneſs in thee, that thou doeſt the things, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt are ſins: I ſay, Deviliſh, becauſe the Devils have great light in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, but malicious enmity againſt God in their wills: If therefore thou wouldſt prepare the way for God in thy heart, and have the gates of thy ſoul unbolted, that the King of Glory may come in, be ſure, let thy converſation anſwer thy conviction; let thy heart in affections and practice, be proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to thy light and judgement; be ſo bleſſed, that when thou knoweſt, thou doeſt alſo: Therefore you that live under much preaching, are often in hearing, and miniſterial admonitions, you had need take heed to your ſelves, for as often as thou ſinneſt, thou goeſt againſt the inſtructions of thy own heart: Thou knoweſt otherwiſe, thou haſt been taught otherwiſe, thou haſt heard other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; <hi>This is kicking againſt the prick:</hi> This daily uſe to the noiſe and ſound of conſcience, will at laſt take away the terribleneſs thereof.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Thoſe alſo are very far from turning unto God, even without any hope,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6. Thoſe that by God are given up to the power of their ſins.</note> 
                     <hi>that are by Gods just judgement, forſaken and given up to the power of their ſins,</hi> to ſin with all greedineſs, wilfulneſs, and without any remorſe at all. There are ſuch who have this incurable diſeaſe upon them; and which is more terrible, it is to be found chiefly in the Church of God, and amongſt them, that have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the beſt means: Thus <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6. 10. Many of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are to have their eyes ſhut, and their ears made deaf, and their hearts ſenſeleſs or fat, leſt they ſhould underſtand and be converted. To <hi>make the heart fat,</hi> is a metaphor from beaſts, that by the fatteſt paſtures, are ſooneſt prepared for the Shambles; ſo many people by the choiceſt and moſt excellent means of grace, are ripened for this heavy judgement of a ſenſeleſs ſpirit. Wo be it to thoſe perſons, that are ſmitten with this ſpiritual blindeneſs: Behold then the ſeverity and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of God, to ſeveral perſons, who for a long while receive his grace in vain, and reſiſt his ſpirit; God in his anger ſweareth, <hi>This people ſhall never enter into his reſt,</hi> give them blinde eyes, a deceived heart, a ſtupid conſcience, let no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry trouble them, let no judgement awaken them: Therefore howſoever thou boaſteſt in thy boldneſs and impudency in ſinning, and braveſt it towards God and man, yet thou art more terribly curſed then <hi>Cain,</hi> for he went trembling about under his curſe, and thou goeſt ſecurely in all jollity and mirth.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>A people of frequent reſolves and purpoſes to amend, while judgements</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">7. Thoſe that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter judgements are removed, againſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, return to their former ſins again.</note> 
                     <hi>are upon them, but when they are removed, returning to their former ſins again:</hi> Such diſcover their inconſtancy and hypocriſie ſo often, that they give little hopes of a true and right turning to God. <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> while the hand of God was heavy on him, how ready then for his duty! then he will let the people go, then he cryeth out of his ſin; but no ſooner is the rod taken off his back, but he is in the mire as before. The people of Iſrael are alſo a pregnant inſtance for this, while they were in fears of enemies, or under any of Gods ſore judgements, that they ſought and cryed mightily to God; but let them have reſpit, they fall from God again: Hence are they ſo often condemned for hypocriſie and backſliding, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

There are many people in times of fear, and dangers of death, are as ſoft as wax; but when recovered, as hard as iron: Men of aguiſh diſpoſitions, ſometimes very hot, and again very cold; ſometimes in great fears, ſtraights and troubles of ſoul, ready to roar out like Bears, for the anguiſh upon their ſouls, becauſe they have ſinned againſt God; and other times as bold, and ready for the ſame ſins they complained of, as if they were not the ſame men. As they ſay of long ague fits, they end at laſt in a conſumption; ſo theſe changes and viciſſitudes upon thy ſoul, will at laſt end in final Apoſtacy: O then be ſure to keep up all thoſe Engagements and Obligations thou haſt taken upon thy ſelf: Be the ſame in health, as ſickneſs; in joy, as fear; after a ſermon, as when thou art hearing one, that fills thy heart with fears.</p>

Solomon</hi> doth often ſentence a ſcorner, for a man that ſhall periſh in his wickedneſs. I know not why it is, but it falls out, that godlineſs and true holineſs is the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ſcorn, deriſion and contempt to carnal and wicked men: Thus <hi>David</hi> was the ſong of drunkards; and what is more ordinary, then to deſpiſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride the practical power of godlineſs?

                  </p>
                  <p>And firſt, <hi>The poſſibility of thy converſion may make thee ſet about it.</hi> It is not with thee as with the damned, and divels in hell. Being thou art not yet in the Grave and Hell, there may be hopes for thee. Although the laſt day I ſhewed how difficult and unlikely ſome men were to turn to God, yet that was onely in reſpect of viſible ſecond cauſes; otherwiſe as when our Saviour ſaid, <hi>It was as impoſſible for a rich man to be ſaved, as a Camel to go through the eye of a needle;</hi> the Diſciples then cryed out, <hi>Who then can be ſaved?</hi> But our Saviour ſaid, <hi>With man indeed it is impoſſible, but with God all things are poſſible;</hi> So ſinners, and wicked men under thoſe Characters thus deſcribed, are no more likely to turn to God, then a Camel with its bunch-back to go through the eye of a needle: but with God all things are poſſible. An abſolute impoſſibility of turning to God is onely in thoſe that have ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt, or are for ever delivered up by God to an impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and a hard heart. But who they are, is rather a ſecret in Gods councel, then a myſtery diſcovered to us: ſo that no wicked men under any Characters whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver (unleſſe thoſe excepted) may conclude in deſpair, That it is not poſſible they ſhould ever be converted. God doth here invite the ſinners of Iſrael in what quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſoever, to turn to God; now this is a great encouragement, the very poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of turning to God. Ah, How juſtly might God ſtrike thee dead in thy ſinnes, ſend thee with thy goar blood to hell, and leave thee hopeleſs and helpleſſe? But he hath not ſhut the dore againſt thee: He hath not yet bid thee depart into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire, He knoweth thee not. It ſhould be like oyl in thy bones to think ſuch a thing may be. O Lord, Is not my condition deſperate? Is there any hope left for me? Am I not paſt all favour? Is not my time ſpent? Oh, What a mercy is this? But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>ing the poſſibility is uncertain, thy life is ſo ſhort, time is ſo quickly run out, that it may be thy converſion is not poſſible for any longer then a day more, or a night more; then what inexcuſable folly and madneſſe will it be to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it? It is many times Satans temptation to hold men a long while in ſin, and then to perſwade them it is too late to turn to God. At firſt any time is ſoon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:30767:231"/>
and afterwards every day is too late; but never believe that ſuggeſtion. Oh then, as the Husbandman ploweth in hope, which nouriſheth all actions; ſo thou maiſt hear in hope, pray in hope, ſet onwork of reformation in hope; for God never bid a people ſeek his Name in vain.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Not onely the poſſibility, but the probability may much prevail with thee.</hi> For on Gods part it ſeemeth more probable thou maiſt be converted, then millions <note place="margin">2.</note> in the world. So that howſoever many men by abuſe of the means, may make their condition far worſe then that of Heathens and Pagans: yet if we ſpeak ſtrictly in reſpect of the means themſelves, it is far more probable thou that haſt the means of converſion, ſhouldſt be converted, rather then thoſe that enjoy them not. The greateſt part of the world ſits in horrible darkneſſe without any light: to them the word hath not come, which yet is the ordinary means of converſion; ſo that on Gods part, and the means, it is far more likely that God wills thy converſion, rather then thoſe to whom he ſends no Prophets at all. It is true, the word is ſometimes ſent to harden men, and it becomes the ſavour of death; but this is after men have horribly abuſed it: and it is not the proper and genuine effect of the word, but accidental through the indiſpoſition and obſtinacy of the hearers. Well then, let this encourage thee to turn to God, God hath not withdrawn, or denied the means to thee; yet he ſends his Prophets, and miniſters to call thee to him: Why doth God vouchſafe all this to me? who ſhould turn if I do not? Oh it is intollerable ſhame if any in the world turn to God, and thou doſt not who art ſo often exhorted. Doe any in the world repent, grieve for, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake their ſinnes? and doeſt not thou who enjoyeſt the powerfull means of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>It is not onely probable, but thy turning to him is very acceptable and welcome.</hi> Thou art ſure to have the dore opened to thee: Never any man turned <note place="margin">3.</note> to God that was put back again: <hi>Come unto me, ho, every one that thirſteth come, come and buy without money,</hi> Iſai. 55. 1. <hi>No man that cometh unto me, will I in any waies caſt off,</hi> John 6. 37. ſo that this ſhould be like fire in every ſinners bowels. Oh Lord, when men have been offended, and grievouſly injured, they many times become ſo implacable, that no ſubmiſſion, no ſatisfaction can content them. But God after all the deſpite and diſdain done unto him, is willing to be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: this goodneſſe and mercy of God ſhould abundantly change thy heart. And certainly thou doſt not ſeriouſly and fully ponder theſe things in thy heart, if thou dideſt, thou wouldeſt not a moment longer ſtay from running to him: Thou wouldeſt not onely turn, but run to him; <hi>Draw us, and we will run after thee,</hi> praieth the Church, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. God doth not onely powerfully over-rule the ſoul, but ſo ſweetly enclines it to delight in good and holy objects, that when the heart hath once taſted of the goodneſſe of God, nothing can keep it from him: Seeing therefore thy turning unto God is ſo acceptable to him, is ſo vehemently deſired by him, Why ſhould it not make thee ſhake off all ſlothfulneſſe, and addreſs thy ſelf to him?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Therefore turn to God, becauſe this will prove thy good, and thy hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe:</hi> It makes not at all to Gods happineſſe: God is all-ſufficient, the Sun, to which the Starres contribute no light: <hi>My goodneſſe doth not extend to thee,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> Pſalm 16. 2. If a man drink of a fountain he bettereth himſelf, he doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit the fountain: If a man ſee any comfortable objects by the Suns light, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſheth himſelf, he doth not advantage the Sun: So it is here; If thou turn to God, God is not made more happy by thee, he needeth not thy converſion, or thy Graces; but it is thy ſelf onely that will reap the profit. Oh then let this move thee, What doth this at all avail God? If I turn to him, it is my good, not his that is intereſted herein? One would think that ſelf-love would herein provoke thee; for will a man give all he hath for a Temporal life, and not much rather for Eternal?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="422" facs="tcp:30767:232"/>
Fifthly, <hi>Therefore turn to God, becauſe he is your God.</hi> God is the God of a people two waies, internally, when he changeth their hearts, and indeed beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth <note place="margin">5.</note> all ſpirituall priviledges upon them; and thus he is a God onely to thoſe that have true grace; that are the Children of the promiſe, and according to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: but then he is a God externally to all ſuch who outwardly own him, and call upon him: A God by externall Covenant and acceptation; and in this ſenſe he is the God even of thoſe that are the Children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the fleſh onely. Now the ſcripture makes this externall relation to be a ground why we ſhould turn from our ſins, <hi>Hoſea 12. 6. Therefore turn thou to thy God;</hi> to thy God, the propriety is a ground of Converſion; and certainly the motives are very attractive which are drawn from this: You all by your Baptiſme have received God as your God; to be no more the Divels, or ſins, or the worlds: if therefore thou haſt Apoſtatized, and broken this Covenant, How neceſſary is it to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>urn?</p>
                  <p>For 1. <hi>By External Covenant, thou tookeſt God to be the Husband of thy ſoul.</hi> The Scripture delights to expreſſe it, by betrothing, and marrying the ſoul to God, <hi>Hoſea 2. 19. Thou wast to leave Father, and Mother, and all Loves, and to cleave to him onely.</hi> Now by thy ſins thou haſt turned from this Husband, and haſt ſet thy heart upon other Lovers. Thus the Scripture doth not onely call Idolatry Adol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and going after other Husbands, but all inordinate love of the World, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing therein, <hi>James 4. 5. Ye Adulterers, and Adultereſſes, know ye not the friendſhip of the world, is enmity with God?</hi> Here all kinde of immoderate, and exceſſive affections to any Creature, is Adultery: ſo then whenſoever thou art turned from God to any ſin, thou haſt run from thy Lawfull Husband; thou haſt forſaken the true object of thy Love: is it not then all the reaſon in the World to take up the Churches reſolution, <hi>Hoſea 2. 7. I will go and return to my firſt Husband, for then it was better with me then now:</hi> ſay then, my ſoul hath been playing the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot all the while it hath forſaken God; it was God, and not theſe that my ſoul pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to cleave unto.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>As an Husband,</hi> ſo in the next place, <hi>a Father alſo thou tookeſt him to be, and by this means thou art commanded to call him Father:</hi> But if thou like a Prodigall haſt left thy Father, and ſpent thy ſubſtance in the ſervice of the Divel, With what face canſt thou call him Father? Think of it ſeriouſly, you who live in groſſe and palpable ſins: Is God the Father of ſuch wicked ſinners? Have they the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters of ſons, and not rather of enemies, who thus diſobey him? remember then that thou haſt forſaken thy Father, and by thy ſins haſt turned from him. Is it not time then with the Prodigall to ſay, <hi>I will ariſe, and goe to my Father, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that I have ſinned againſt him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Laſtly, <hi>Then was he taken for a Lord and Maſter; for a King to rule and reign over thee.</hi> Thy Baptiſme was a giving of thy ſelf wholly up to Gods govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to walk according to his Laws; now ſince that, How perfidiouſly haſt thou violated thy Oath? Thou haſt not been a ſervant to him, but to the Divel, Gods great enemy. It is uſuall with Divines to ſay, Baptiſme is <hi>Sacramentum militare,</hi> a Military Oath; becauſe every Chriſtian being called to a ſpirituall war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farre, doth there ſwear fidelity to Jeſus Chriſt, as the Captain of his ſalvation. Now every wicked man is, <hi>Proditor militiae,</hi> a flyer from his Colours, and runs into the enemies Camp. Conſider then what Rebellion and Treaſon againſt God is in every ſin, after thy Baptiſm-ingagements; thou art a runagate ſervant from thy Maſter. Now if ſo, is it not requiſite that thou ſhouldeſt turn back to him? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſinner is not only an Apoſtate, and Covenant breaker in <hi>Adam</hi> our firſt Parent, but a ſecond time a revolter, and Covenant breaker alſo, by not living according to that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Therefore turn to God from ſin, becauſe ſin is a ſtate of thraldom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>and ſlavery, and our converſion unto God, puts us in a ſtate of freedome and libertie. Of what a man is overcome, that is he a ſervant to,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 Pet. 2. 19.

But thou art to believe the Word of God againſt thy own ſenſe and feeling; that makes it ſuch a Captivitie and ſlavery. Oh therefore pray to have this Captivitie turned: Why do I live in a Dangeon, when God hath glorious manſion places? Why do I feed on husks, when God hath ſuch dainties for a true convert? leave off this drudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſin: The divel is an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Turn unto God, becauſe he will then turn unto thee, for ſo he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth.</hi> Do thou turn with an holy change, and he will with a gracious change. Thou hadſt thy back on God, and God turned the back upon thee. Thou was an enemy to God, and God was an enemy to thee: But who can ſtand under his enmity? Who can endure his wrath? But upon the ſouls turning to God, what an happy change and turn is made in all Gods diſpenſations? The Creatures are now turned when he is turned; for they groaned under him as under a burthen. The Angels are now turned to him when he is turned; for they are reconciled, and take him for a fellow ſervant. The Scripture that is curned alſo; for whereas before every page did ſpeak terror, and breath forth anger, now it breaths onely comfort and conſolation to ſuch. The providence of God is now turned; for whereas before every thing was a Curſe, and wrought to thy Damnation, now eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing worketh to thy good, and furthers thy ſalvation, Yea now God is turned, (to ſpeak after the manner of men, though the change is properly in us, not in him) for he that was an enemy, that was angry, that accounted all thy prayers Abhominations, that askedſt thee, What thou hadſt to do to take his Name in thy mouth: Now he becomes a gracious Father, anſwereth prayers, and welcometh thee into his preſence. Thus you ſee how happy a thing it is to turn to God, for then every thing in Heaven and Earth, becomes alſo turned for thy good.</p>

                  <p>Ninthly, <hi>Set before thy eyes thoſe Converts who are recorded in the Scripture, and ſee the joy and happineſſe of their condition, and then do thou write after their copy.

What unſpeakable joy doth he finde in his heart to think he is what he was not once? If thou hadſt never heard of any that turned from their ſinnes to God, or if they did, that they have repented that ever they repented, they were ſorry that they turned from their ſinnes; it was better with them when they ſerved their luſts, then when they ſerved God. Then thou mighteſt have ſome plea. But when thou readeſt of the exceeding joy, and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull bleſſedneſſe and peace of Conſcience they have had, who have been thus converted from their evill waies, What cords of ſinne can be ſo ſtrong as to hold thee any longer?

This is your caſe who live in groſſe and prophane courſes: Thou art going the clean contrarie way to heaven; men go not to heaven through ſuch miry paths; and beſides, there is Hell and damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all the curſes of God in the way, Why then ſhould you not ſay, Bleſſed be God, and bleſſed be thoſe Watchmen that have given me this warning?

rib. It comes and kiſſes thee as <hi>Judas</hi> did Chriſt when he had plotted the betraying of him into his enemies hands. Therefore judge thus of thy luſts, and thou wilt pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily eſcape from them.</p>
                  <p>Twelfthly, <hi>Therefore turn unto God, becauſe the end of all Gods judgements</hi>

                     <hi>and calamities which are brought upon thee, whether publick or private, are for this, to make thee turn from thy ſinnes.</hi> When <hi>Nineveh</hi> is to be deſtroyed, ſhe muſt turn from her evil waies, elſe no hope: That threatning was to prepare for Converſion. Thus the Prophet <hi>Iſai,</hi> and others, <hi>Amos</hi> 6. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, <hi>I ſmote you with famine,</hi> and reckons up many ſeveral judgements, and in the enumeration of every one, ſtill concludes, <hi>yet are ye not returned to me, ſaith God:</hi> So that the end why God bringeth his ſore judgements, is, That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one in the Land ſhould turn unto God. Haſt thou any perſonall Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, any Domeſtick Afflictions? The leſſon God would alſo teach thee by theſe roddes, is to turn from thy iniquities to him: Yea, as the end of all Gods Works, ſo of his Word alſo, of all Preaching, and all hearing, is Converſion unto God.</p>
                  <p>Uſe, <hi>Of exhortation.</hi> Refuſe not all theſe Motives, reject not theſe grounds of Converſion: Which of them hath not reaſon and ſtrength enough in it to bring thee to God? Art thou not ſure to ſpeed? Will not all ſorrow be turned into joy, when all wickedneſſe is turned into godlineſſe? Can you doe better, be more happy by turning unto thy luſts which have a moments plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and an eternities torment? Why do you not with all humility and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe bleſſe God that calls you to turn to him? Why ſhould he not ſuffer the Divell and ſinne ſtill to reign over thee, whom thou doſt ſo willingly ſerve? Conſider, What joy there is in Heaven, when a wicked man is converted to God; What joy there is on earth to faithfull Miniſters, to Godly friends, when this Converſion is vouchſafed unto thee: Oh ſay Then, though many Sermons have heretofore moved me, and made me almoſt to leave my ſins, yet this ſhall turn me quite from them: I will be tempted no longer: I will no more conſult with fleſh and blood, and God grant you may go home with another ſpirit upon you; God grant that you might finde the World like fire burning in your bowels, that it may be ſaid of every one of you as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his Prodigall Son, He was loſt, but now he is found; he was dead, but now he is alive.</p>

                  <p>THis ſubject of Converſion, is like <hi>Ezekiels</hi> waters, that riſe higher and higher; therefore marvel not, if we continue long upon it, for the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will ſtill be new, though it be the ſame Text. The laſt day our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor was, to uſe all thoſe forcible Reaſons, that might perſwade you to turn from your ſins to God; although indeed, the very naming of it, doth carry ſo much light and truth with it, that it argueth incredible ſtupidity and obſtinacyin all thoſe, who yet wilfully continue in their iniquities: that therefore every moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain may be made level, &amp; every valley raiſed, to make a prepared way for Chriſt, I ſhall anſwer thoſe Objections, or Prejudices, or Cavils, which are as a great gulf between them and converſion. The Objections that ariſe from a carnal vain heart, I will call <hi>The mountains that muſt be made low;</hi> the objections from a diſcouraged or dejected heart, that doubteth of its acceptance with God, if it doth return, or imagineth ſtrange impoſſibilities for its own particular; this I call <hi>The valley that must be exalted:</hi> And firſt, let us endeavor to prevail with the carnal man, to have ſo much faith, as to throw this mountain into the ſea. That objection which I ſhall begin with, is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To turn unto God, is to leave all thoſe pleaſures, that delight and carnal mirth, I have had in my ſinful ways:</hi> If ſo be I were to be a Cloiſtered Monk, or a ſolitary <note place="margin">1. Carnal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</note> Hermit; If I were perſecuted, flying into caves and dens, that it would deprive me of all my pleaſure, then ſuch contemplations, and holy meditations might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced; but for me, that finde ſuch pleaſure, ſuch jollity in my wicked ways, to turn to God with mourning and humiliation, is to bid me be no more <hi>Naomi,</hi> but <hi>Marah:</hi> Thus the voluptuous man, the unclean man, the drunkard, the glutton, the earthly and coveteous man; yea, all who finde iniquity, like honey in their mouth; theſe all ſpeak like the Fig-tree and Olive-tree in <hi>Judges, Shall I leave my fatneſs, and my ſweetneſs, and forſake all my former pleaſures, to mourn and faſt, and reform, and to live a ſtrict life of mortification?</hi> Thus every man is drawn aſide by pleaſure. To take you off in this reſpect:</p>
                  <p>Firſt conſider, <hi>That the Scriptures judgement about ſin, is wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to thine:</hi> The word of God acknowledgeth no pleaſure, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireableneſs <note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> in ſin; but the clean contrary, Gall, and Wormwood, and Bitterneſs, and Death, Wrath, and Terror, and Curſes, and Torments: How then comeſt thou to ſpeak of pleaſures and delight in ſin, when Gods word knoweth no ſuch thing? Now the Scripture is the wiſdom of an All-knowing God, and we are to believe that, more then our own ſenſe and apprehenſion: We ſee diſeaſes do ſo infect the palate, that it many times judgeth bitter ſweet, and ſweet bitter,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:30767:234"/>
but the nature of things is not changed becauſe the palate is changed; and thus it is here, by reaſon of that corrupt frame of heart in thee, thou judgeſt ſin pleaſant; no ordinances, no godly objects have any ſavour or delight in them: but theſe do greatly affect thee; know all this is a diſeaſe, a ſickneſs upon thy heart, as ſome diſeaſes make the ſick parties eat black coals, and ſuch loathſom <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>raſh: This is a diſeaſe. The word of God, which onely revealeth true wiſdom, ſpeaketh otherwiſe: Oh then! call no more thy luſts ſweet, thy ſins pleaſant, its a diſeaſe on thee makes thee think ſo, if thy palate and taſte were ſpiritual, thou wouldſt with diſlike, reject every temptation of ſin, as Chriſt did the vinegar they gave him to drink. <hi>Paul</hi> told <hi>Elymas, He was in the ſtate of gall and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> Acts 8. 23. <hi>Elymas</hi> did not think ſo, nor feel ſo: And thus is every wicked man, in a condition of gall and miſery; if his heart were truly qualified, he would cry out of the bitterneſs of thoſe ſins, which he now ſaith are ſweet: Judge then righteous judgement about thy iniquities, and thou wilt quickly forſake them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Grant thy ſins have pleaſure and delight in them, yet they are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant onely to the bruitiſh and ſenſual part of a man; the eyes, the ears, the body, the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>imagination, theſe for the moſt part are pleaſed in the actings of ſin:</hi> Now what an unworthy and irrational thing is it for thee, to purſue thoſe pleaſures, which are common to thee, with beaſts? Sin haply may bring bodily pleaſures, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily delight; but how low ſhould theſe things be to thee that haſt a ſoul, whoſe true good and happineſs lyeth in godly actions, and enjoying of God? Did not the rich man in the Goſpel, ſhew himſelf like a beaſt, when ſpeaking of his barns full, he ſaid, <hi>Soul, take thy eaſe, for thou haſt much good laid up for thee,</hi> Luke 12. 19. Soul! O brutiſh expreſſion, what were theſe good things to his ſoul? he might have ſaid, Body, take thy caſe, but Soul he could not: when therefore the pleaſures of ſin, have painted themſelves, like <hi>Jezebel,</hi> to intice and deceive thee, reject them with diſdain: Theſe are not pleaſures for an immaterial, immortal ſoul; theſe are not a proper delight, for the chief and moſt noble part of me; If I were onely a body, and not a ſoul; then there might be greater reaſon to admit them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Grant further, that ſin hath pleaſure with it, <hi>yet its ſuch a pleaſure, that cauſeth death, a pleaſure that brings damnation with it;</hi> like ſome deadly and <note place="margin">3.</note> mortal herbs, that they ſay, will put a man into laughing till he dyeth: Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant delightful things, do ſooner cauſe diſeaſes, then bitter: Much honey, quickly turneth into much choler; ſo that ſins imbracement of thee, is like that of the Ivy, which ſecretly devoureth the thing it cleaveth to. Conſider what the Wiſeman, that had got the true experience of all things, affirmeth, <hi>I ſaid of laughter, It was madneſs,</hi> Eccleſ. 2. 2. and, <hi>It is better to go to the houſe of mourning, then of mirth,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 2. do not then like thy ſins the better, becauſe ſweet and delightful. Poyſon that kills preſently, may be made ſweet; and ſo thoſe ſweet luſts, and thoſe ſweet ſports of ſin, convey death and hell in their pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Let it be ſtill granted, that ſin hath pleaſure in it, <hi>yet it is but for a moment, its but like the blazing of ſome crackling thorns in the fire:</hi> That which <note place="margin">4.</note> the Scripture ſpeaks about a mans vanity of life; its but a Vapor, a Shadow, a Bubble, is true of all the pleaſures of ſin; they paſs away in the enjoying of them: The godly comfort themſelves in this, <hi>That theſe preſent afflictions are but light and momentany, in reſpect of that eternal weight of glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 7. and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary a wicked man may ſay, That theſe preſent momentany pleaſures, are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to that eternal weight of torment: Thus the grace of <hi>Moſes</hi> is commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>That he choſe rather to endure the reproaches of Chriſt, then to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon,</hi> Heb. 11. They are but pleaſures for a ſeaſon; O then! when thou art but a mortal ſinner, and thy joy a mortal joy, all is fading; why then art thou ſo importunate after theſe ſhadows?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Although ſins may have ſweetneſs for the preſent, yet they have a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note>
                     <pb n="428" facs="tcp:30767:235"/>
                     <hi>and a ſting afterwards.</hi> A man that in his hot blood hath got a dangerous wound, he feels it not preſently; but when he is cold, then he begins to be ſenſible of it: And thus it is here, a man in the hot and violent purſuit of luſts, feels no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, apprehends nothing; but when his conſcience is once awakened and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, then he cryeth out, O the wounds, the ſting, the blows that ſin giveth him: Thus <hi>Solomon,</hi> ſpeaking againſt drunkenneſs, not to be inticed with the occaſions of it, he addeth his reaſon, <hi>Look not upon the wine, while it moveth it ſelf in the cup, for at laſt it biteth like a Serpent, and ſtingeth like an Adder.</hi> Prov. 23. 32. Little doth the drunkard think, he had as good ſwallow down ſo many live Adders, and ſtinging Serpents. The Apoſtle tells us, <hi>That ſin hath a ſting,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. How then is it, that thou perceiveſt the honey, but not the ſting of it? but its no wonder, for this is at laſt: At laſt it biteth like an Adder, at the time of death, at the time of fears and grievous judgements, then it puts forth thoſe ſharp and poyſonous ſtings. It was <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> advice, we ſhould look upon pleaſures going and notcoming, they leave horror and terror behinde them: Commune therefore with your own hearts, ſit down and conſider, This ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will be turned into gall; this is the Devils ſubtilty, to preſent the pleaſure, but not the torment of a ſin; ſee what a ſting it made in <hi>Cains</hi> conſcience, what a ſting in <hi>Judas,</hi> and it will be ſuch a ſcorpion in thy ſide one time or other.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Thou wilt not turn to God, becauſe of the pleaſure in ſin? <hi>Oh! but what pleaſures and joy doeſt thou indeed deny thy ſelf, by not turning to him:</hi> If husks <note place="margin">6.</note> and droſs hath pleaſure, how much hath true repentance, and the exerciſe of the graces of Gods ſpirit, which is the true manna? If a wilderneſs be ſuch a delight? what may <hi>Canaan</hi> be? If theſe droſſie and filthy luſts do affect thee, then how may glorious objects move thee, if thy heart were ſpiritual? <hi>At thy right hand</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) are rivers of pleaſures for evermore,</hi> Pſal. 16. 11. and, <hi>We believe with joy unſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 8. Therefore if pleaſure and ſweetneſs do move thee, <hi>Oh taſte and ſee how good God is, and all the ways of godlineſs.</hi> The pleaſures of the world are like muddy puddling waters; but theſe are pure ſtreams: Thou wilt finde one hours praying, better then a thouſand of prophane fudlings; one hours enjoyments of Chriſt as thy husband, by faith, then all the wanton dalliances and unchaſt imbracements of unlawful objects: Oh then! thou art an enemy to thy true joy, to thy true peace, as long as thou doeſt not turn to God.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Call not that pleaſure, which when thy ſoul is powerfully wrought upon by Gods grace, will be onely bitter and miſerable to thee:</hi> Look upon all the true <note place="margin">1.</note> converts unto God, how have they been affected with ſin: Did not <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> with anguiſh of heart, cauſe floodgates of ſorrow to be opened? Did not <hi>David</hi> upon his after-converſion to God, being turned aſide by murther and adultry, lie roaring through anguiſh of ſpirit? <hi>What profit,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>have ye of thoſe things, whereof you are now aſhamed,</hi> Rom. 6. 21. And ſo here, What pleaſure and ſweetneſs is there in that, which you now finde ſo bitter? And if thou haſt not ſuch a merciful time here to finde it bitter? thou wilt have a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and juſt time to finde it ſo in hell: What? do the damned ſouls feel any pleaſure? is there ſo much as one drop of honey, in all the gall they are to drink? If not, where is thy wiſdom and judgement, that doeſt not throw away thy ſins as ſo much hemlock, and imbrace godlineſs in the room thereof, which brings its pleaſant well-come with it, even much tranquillity and quietneſs of conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Thus we have unmasked this Objection, and made that appear to be a ſerpent, which was taken for ſo pleaſant a fiſh, if we may allude to our Saviours ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The next obſtruction in the way, which doth commonly keep men from turning to God, is the profit and great advantage they finde in thoſe ſins they live in:</hi> If they <note place="margin">2. The profit of ſin.</note> be ſins of Iujuſtice, Violence, Oppreſſion, any unlawful way of gain; Oh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="429" facs="tcp:30767:235"/>
hard then, not to cry out, <hi>Great is Diana:</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome, that thought gain was godlineſs, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. 5. not godlineſs gain, as it is indeed great gain: Thus ambitious men, covetous men, thoſe that are immoderately affected to any thing, they care not what laws they break, what violation they offer to Gods Commands, ſo that they may be rich, and great, and honored in this world, that is all they look at; ſo that a too attentive eye to worldly profit, is that many times which keeps from turning to God.</p>
                  <p>This is alſo eaſily anſwered, if a man go into Gods Sanctuary, or plow with his Heifer: For</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>If there be profit in thy ſinful ways, it is about worldly fading things, which</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Anſw. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>will leave thee at laſt, as Judas his thirty pieces did, in a tormenting hell:</hi> Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour tells us, <hi>That if a man ſhould get the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul, it will not avail him,</hi> Mat. 16. 26. whereas that is indeed profit, which is immortal, which will continue for ever, which is profit in life time, and profit in death time, which will be profit when thy body is buried, and rotting in the grave: Thou then that getteſt profit, and this earthly profit comes upon thee daily, ſtill remember thy grave will be a period to it: There is a ſudden ſtorm ariſing, that will make all this ſuffer ſhipwrack, and thou muſt ſwim naked, as it were, to Gods Tribunal, to be judged there.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Never call ſin profitable, for to that are all the curſes of God threatned,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> How then can that be profitable to thee, which makes a man curſed at home, and curſed abroad, curſed in all his ſtore and abundance? Oh do not deceive thy ſelf! it is not wealth, but Gods wrath thou art treaſuring up every day: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, godlineſs is profitable for all things, as the Scripture ſaith; and hath the promiſe of this world, and the world to come; but wickedneſs is profitable for nothing, but hath the curſes of this world, and the world to come: Do not then account of any increaſe by ſin, God hath threatned to blaſt it, it will melt away like the dew, it will turn to garvel in the belly; all theſe profitable mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels God will make thee vomit up. Hence the Scripture doth ſo commend a little with Gods favor, and obtained in Gods way, then all treaſures with iniquity, <note place="margin">Pſal. 37.</note> call not then that profitable, which is either the moth to eat thee ſecretly, or the fire to deſtroy thee violently.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>That is onely profitable, which is profitable to the greateſt good that we</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>ſtand in need of, and to divert the greatest evil that can befal us:</hi> Now no ſins are profitable to that, but the clean contrary; for the greateſt good that we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of, is the favor of God, the light of his countenance: This <hi>David</hi> doth ſo often pray for in his ſtraights, as being the onely Sun to diſpel that dark night which was upon him; and on the contrary, no evil, no not of miſery, torment, and pain, is like that of Gods anger and fury againſt ſin. Now take all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and advantages thou haſt got in a ſinful way, what do theſe help, for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of the one, or repelling of the other? Oh take <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> burning and ſcalding in the guilt of ſin, can they buy Gods favor? can they purchaſe the light of his countenance? Doth not the Scripture make the ruſt of their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, <note place="margin">James 1. 3.</note> and the timber in the wall, to cry out, and witneſs againſt the wicked man? Then be aſhamed ever to pretend this any more, that the wicked ways thou liveſt in, are in ſo many reſpects hopeful to thee, for that cannot be, it deſtroyeth the main, and is contrary to the true happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>That cannot be called profitable, which as it cannot help to the good we cannot want; ſo neither at the time, when we are in the greateſt extremity. Riches</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>will not avail in the day of wrath. Iudas</hi> had the bitter experience of this; if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou couldſt finde any true profit in the way of ſin, it might then be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, when at the time of death, or at the time of fearful and heavy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, thou art in the greateſt extreamity: But (alas!) how truly mayeſt thou take up that, Ye are miſerable comforters all; who doth not then cry out of his ſins? who doth not then bewail the time, and his folly, that ever he entertained
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:30767:236"/>
ſuch a bitter-ſweet as ſin is: Take up then at laſt principles of wiſdom, lay up treaſure for an evil day, provide againſt a ſad ſtorm ariſe, and what will that be? The hour of death, the hour of Gods judgements: Oh! then to have an Ark to run into, then to have a mark upon thee, that the deſtroying Angel may not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume thee, is a great mercy: But this will never be obtained in a ſinful way; ſo that if thou turn to God, and art conſtant in the daily exerciſe of grace, then thou haſt the onely Cordial, the onely Oyl to be poured in thy wounded ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Never pretend profit, for all the while thou doeſt not turn to God, thou art in every thing a loſer:</hi> Who can enumerate all thy loſſes which come through ſin? <note place="margin">5.</note> There is the loſs of all true joy and peace of conſcience; there is the loſs of eternity in happineſs, of heaven, and all the glory therein, which is more then can enter into the heart of man to conceive; there is loſs of thy immortal ſoul, which is more worth then all the world; and laſtly, there is the loſs of God, the fountain of all good and happineſs, <hi>Bonum in quo omnia bona,</hi> That Ocean of good, in which all the ſeveral ſtreams of goodneſs empty themſelves: Oh then that ever thou ſhouldſt be ſo ſeduced, as to ſay, Its better to live in my ſins as I do, then to turn unto God! for what? is it better to have that preſent profit, then Heaven, Happineſs, and God to all eternity? Oh ſay rather! Theſe my ſins will never make ſatisfaction for the loſs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>incur by them; theſe my corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will never get me as much, as I loſe through them: I keep coals and dung; and part with gold and precious pearls. Its the great ignorance and pravity of our corrupt natures, that knoweth not how to put a right prize and eſteem upon things.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, If thy profit keep thee from turning to God, and thou thinkeſt it a great part of wiſdom and prudence to continue in this ſaving way, as thou calleſt <note place="margin">6.</note> it: <hi>Then how doth this condemn all the holy Martyrs and Confeſſors for the faith of Chriſt, of the greateſt folly and madneſs that ever was;</hi> They may then lay aſide thoſe Robes of Glory they are adorned with; For what did not they loſe? their wealth, their riches, their pleaſures, their lives to follow God; they thought turning to Chriſt more profit, then turning to any carnal ſafe way in the world. Did not the Martyrs take the ſpoiling of their goods joyfully? Did not they as willingly lay down their bodies at the ſtake, as men do their cloathes to ſleep? Certainly, ſin and the world did then tempt them to turn out of Gods way, but they would go forward; and thereby our Saviour had given them an excellent Antidote, <hi>He that will ſave his life, ſhall loſe it; and he that will loſe it, ſhall ſave it:</hi> And thus we have caſt this mountain down, that exalted it ſelf againſt our converſion.</p>
                  <p>The third Cavil is, <hi>The cuſtom and habit they have in ſin:</hi> That now they ſay; It is vain to attempt this work; had they in their yonger years ſet themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">3.

                  <p>Secondly, Becauſe evill acquaintance putteth ſo great a demur to Converſion, <hi>Therefore the Scripture is ſo diligent, in giving many exhortations to avoid all the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety</hi>

And <hi>Solomon</hi> the mirror of all wiſdome, is very frequent in Precepts, concerning the Adulterous woman; The young man muſt not come near her dwelling, he muſt paſſe on the other ſide of the ſtreet, keep off from ſuch place as places of the plague, and dangerous infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. So where unjuſt violent men are brought in, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. entiſing the young man to caſt in his lot with them, he is warned to have nothing to do with them, he muſt avoid them, as the bird doth the ſnare that is laid for her. Hereupon the Pſalmiſt begins his firſt Pſalm with the bleſſedneſſe of that man, <hi>who doth not ſit nor walk in the company of the ungodly,</hi> Pſ. 1. 1.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Therefore ill company is dangerous, becauſe ſin is of an infecting conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious nature; it quickly ſpreads through a family, through a pariſh, eſpecially if any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent</hi>

                     <hi>in place and office give an example to wickedneſſe.</hi> The ground of that Church-cenſure, Excommunication, is the contagion of other mens ſins; <hi>Purge out the old leven,</hi> that was in the inceſtuous perſon, 1 Cor. 5. 7. And why? becauſe a little leven leveneth the whole lump: he that toucheth pitch, cannot but be defiled with it. He that lieth in the dung-hil cannot but ſmel of it: ſo then thy delight with ungodly, and prophane men, cannot but in time make thee as black as they. Why ſhould not men be as much afraid of being infected with ſin, as with a contagious diſeaſe? but onely we are carnal, fearing the evil of the body, which is death, but not the evil of the ſoul, which is ſin and damnation. Oh then ſay, Why am I ſuch an enemy to my ſoul? How can I ever turn to God as long as I live here, delight in ſuch men? How can I ever go into <hi>Canaan,</hi> if I leave not this <hi>Egypt?</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>there is not onely evil got by them, but this is alſo a ſure demonſtration of that mans naughty and evil heart.</hi> For it is the old rule, <hi>ſimile, ſimili, gaudet;</hi> ſimilitude

is a cauſe of love; and therefore if ye ſee a man delight in the ſociety of that man, who is prophane and wretched, that man is ſo too in his heart and diſpoſition; for though many men will not outwardly be drunk or ſwear, yet if they love thoſe that do ſo, it is plain their diſpoſitions are againſt godlineſſe as well as others: ſo that as <hi>David</hi> having a godly heart, did evidently demonſtrate this by that expreſſion, <hi>His delight was in the Saints of the earth,</hi> Pſal. 16. 3. So it is a ſure demonſtration of a wicked man, though he may not do outward wickedneſs, yet if he keep company with thoſe that do it. The Apoſtle makes it a ſign we have paſſed from death to life, <hi>If we love the brethren,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 14. and if we love thoſe that live in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of all evil, it is a ſign we are ſtill in the ſtate of death: ſeparate therefore thy ſelf from that evil ſociety, if thou wilt turn at any time to God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Therefore do evil companions ſo greatly hinder converſion, becauſe they are</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>daily hardening and encouraging one another in an evil way.</hi> Thus they emboldened one another that ſaid, <hi>Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall dye:</hi> and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle alleadging this, ſaith, <hi>Evil communications corrupt good manners,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 33. For as the godly are recorded in Scripture as ſo many live <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oals put together, enflaming one another with fire from heaven, thus thoſe that feared God <hi>spake often one to another,</hi> ſath Mal. 3. 15. and in <hi>Eſai,</hi> 23. they are calling upon one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Come, let us go up to the houſe of the Lord, we will go alſo:</hi> So the contrary is with wicked men, they put preſumption and deſperate boldneſs into one another; they hearten one another. Where any hopeful ſeeds of good motions are riſing up, they preſently pull them up: What, you grow preciſe? What, you turn me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy? What matter is it what Miniſters preach? They muſt have ſomething to ſay; thus they are able to blaſt all, and one wicked companion is able to do more hurt, then many ſermons good.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Therefore are thoſe, who are joyned in evil fellowſhip, hardly converted to God, becauſe men are moved by examples, especially of a multitude.</hi> Where corcuption is univerſal, there not to be carried down the ſtream, argueth life of grace: Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples affect more then precepts, becauſe they are viſible and obvious to the eye, Thus <hi>Peter</hi> is ſaid <hi>to comple ſome men to Judaize, by his example meerly,</hi> Gal. 2. 31. eſpecially examples are more potent and violent, when they are general: Therefore you have a ſpeciall command in this caſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evil,</hi> Exod. 23. 1. In corrupt ages, where ſin like a deluge doth overflow, then to have ſome men apply themſelves to God, is a great wonder. Thus it is ſpoken as a great matter after that all fleſh had corrupted his waies, <hi>Then began men to call upon the Lord,</hi> Gen. 4. 26. as ſome expound it; Then ſome men began to ſet up the pure worſhip of God. Well, though this be ſuch a mountain in the way, yet ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations may make thee eaſily climbe over it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>You have the example of ſome who have lived in prophane places, have been</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. Directions and means how to get through, or caſt off the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment of wicked com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions and relations.</note> 
                     <hi>compaſſed about with all wickedneſſe, yet theſe even out of hell have cryed unto God and drawn near unto him.</hi> Thus <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was born of a wicked Father, King <hi>Ahaz,</hi> and all the family was likely very much corrupted, becauſe he did after all the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of the heathens. Yet how wonderfully doth God bring a clean thing from an unclean! Thus in <hi>Nero's</hi> Court, who was the monſter of men, and no doubt but his family a monſter of families, eſpecially for cruelty and bloody perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Church of God, yet the Scripture tells us, <hi>there were a company of Godly men, even in Nero's Court,</hi> Phil. 4. 22. Thus alſo <hi>Nicodemus</hi> a Phariſee, and a great man in the Phariſees counſels, yet he feareth God, and is not drawn aſide by their examples. Do not thou therefore put it off, and ſay, if I lived ſomewhere elſe, if I had any to joyn with me, to take my part, I would then turn to God, but now I muſt do as thoſe with whom I live, elſe there is no abiding for me: ſpeak not thus, for the Scripture recordeth thoſe that have broken through greater difficulties then thou art in, neither if thy heart were right, could this ſtop thee.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Lay this down for a rule, that it is not ſo much a friend, a father, a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>neighbour, as the divel in and by theſe that doth thus tempt thee to keep from God:</hi> For
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:30767:238"/>
ſuch is his ſubtilty to deſtroy thee, that he layeth all baits, and uſeth the moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtruments that may undo thee, as we ſee he did thus from the beginning: He doth not imediately ſet upon <hi>Adam,</hi> but upon <hi>Eve,</hi> and by her ſeduceth him. Oh, If <hi>Adam</hi> had perceived the Divel tempting him by her, How reſolutely would he have gainſaied her? <hi>Rev.</hi> 10. It is ſaid, <hi>The Divel ſhould throw ſome of the Saints into priſon,</hi> How ſo? The Divel would ſtir up the malice and venom of wicked men againſt them; eſpecially this Truth is manifeſted by our Saviour when <hi>Peter</hi> took him aſide, and diſſwaded him from the ſuffering which he was to undergo; ſee what entertainment our Saviour giveth him, <hi>Get thee behinde me Satan, for thou ſavoreſt not the things of God,</hi> Mat. 16. 23. Oh thus ſhould thy zeal and anger work: It is not thy friend, thy father, thy husband, thy neighbour, but the Divel in all theſe, that ſeeks to deſtroy thy ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Remember this, that Chriſt makes it a fundamental qualification in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one that would be his Diſciple, to hate father, and mother; and brother, and ſiſter,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>for his ſake,</hi> Luke 14. 26. Be not then ſtartled at this: Oh my parents, my kindred, my friends would never endure me, ſhould I turn to God, and live a holy ſtrict life. Think of this Text; he that hates not the deareſt relations for Chriſts ſake, is not worthy of Chriſt. Therefore our Saviour calls for a man <hi>to cut off his right hand, to pull out his right eye,</hi> Mat 5. 30. the deareſt things in the world, that may be an offence to him, and keep him from God; for as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>It is better to go with one eye, and one hand to heaven, then both eye and hands to hell.</hi> It is better to go with the frowns and anger of thy deareſt friends to heaven, then with all their love to hell. Never then urge this any more, I dare not for my friends, for my acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; for thou canſt never be Chriſts Diſciple, if any thing be dearer to thee then Chriſt. We ſee Chriſt himſelf, though a pattern of all holineſſe, yet when his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would have had him done ſomething when it was not Gods time, <hi>Woman,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>What have I to do with thee?</hi> Joh. 2. not mother, but woman, and what have I to do with thee?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Whenſoever the Lord begins <hi>to ſhake and trouble thy heart for ſin,</hi> and thou art thinking of another life, to take another courſe; then it is thy ſpeci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> duty <hi>not to ask counſel and advice with carnal &amp; unregenerate friends:</hi> alas they think thou art mad; now thou wilt be undone; they know not what ſuch troubles for ſin mean: Why then ſhouldſt thou diſcover thy diſeaſe to ſuch who are no Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? Take rather <hi>Pauls</hi> example, when God wrought wonderfully from heaven to convert him, <hi>He obeyeth God imediately, and never conſulted with fleſh and blood,</hi> Gal. 2. Thus do thou: Doth God by the Miniſtry, by Preaching, convince thee of thy ſinful waies, of becoming a new man, give up thy ſelf to this call imediately? Do not conſult with fleſh and blood? But as <hi>Eliah</hi> when he threw his cloke upon <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and the ſpirit of God moved his heart, he preſently followeth <hi>Eliah,</hi> will not go home to take leave of his friends, but imediately followeth him: ſo let it be with thee. And we ſee when ſome proffered voluntarily to follow Chriſt, onely they deſired to bid farewell to their friends, and one asked leave but to go and bury his dead Father, that our Saviour rejected them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21. 22, and would admit of none of theſe excuſes: ſo that theſe inſtances ſhould teach thee, when God by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters calls thee from thy ſins, never to ask counſel at home, never to enquire what my kindred and acquaintance will ſay, but preſently follow God.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Doth the ſtrife and variance thou ſhalt have with thy Naturall friends and acquaintance move thee? Oh, <hi>Conſider that Chriſt hath foretold this a long</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>while ago,</hi> and therefore be thou the more encouraged to endure ſuch aſſaults. <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 31, 32. 30. 35. Our Saviour there inſtructing his Diſciples how they ought to confeſſe him before all men, leaſt they ſhould be amazed to ſee the jars and contentions that will be becauſe of godlineſſe: He tels them, I am come to ſet a man at variance againſt his Father, and the Daughter againſt the Mother; and a mans foes ſhall be they of his own houſhold: mark this Text, for it may ſeem very offenſive and harſh. Shall Chriſts Doctrine be a make-bate? ſhall that ſet families
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:30767:238"/>
all on a fire, and a contention? This ſeemeth to be little credit to his Doctrine. But it will be thus, not from the Nature of Chriſts Doctrine, for that is a Doctrine of peace with God, and peace with men: but whereſoever his Truth is received in the practical power of it, ſuch is the violent oppoſition even of the deareſt friends againſt it that are not godly, that it raiſeth up all their hatred and violence againſt it. Hence we read in Eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, that ſometimes even children have been perſecutors of their Fathers: Let not then thy ſpirit ſink under this, That by thy turning to God, and condemning the wicked waies that the family liveth in where thou art, thou ſhalt make much contention, ſtir up an hornets neſt; for this is no more then Chriſt hath foretold. Conſidering the venemous, and malicious diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons men have naturally againſt God and his truth, it cannot be otherwiſe; onely let this teach thee wiſedome, and courage to prepare for a ſtorm.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>How many times do evil and wicked men, though never ſo great one with</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>another, fall out in deadly enmity about worldly ſinfull matters!</hi> For although theſe Swine and Bears do many times agree well among themſelves, eſpecially againſt godlineſs, which they look at as the common enemy, yet there is no true love among wicked men; they hang together as ropes of ſand, any matter of profit, luſt, or pride, will preſently make them rage at one another. Now what ſhouldſt thou care for the love and friendſhip of ſuch men, who can love no body but for ſelf-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects? The Heathens have excellently debated this, that there is no friendſhip a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong wicked men, but onely good men; for when profit or pleaſure is the knot that tyeth them, that is eaſily broken; when wicked men agree, it is not peace, but conſpiracy. Never then let that diſhearten thee: Oh if I ſet my face for godlineſſe, be once accounted in the number of thoſe that walk ſtrictly, all my neighbours will reproach me, every ones mouth will be open. Art thou ſo weak a Creature to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard this? their love is not worth the owning; no wicked man can love another, but for carnal ends; and therefore they are very hypocrites, and ſecret back-biters of one another where it makes for their advantage: ſo that in this thou ſheweſt thy ſelf unworthy of Chriſt: there are many men that its a glory to be ſpoken againſt by them, and it would be a mans diſhonour to have their good word, yea, a man ſhould preſently ſay as the heathen, <hi>nunquia mali feci?</hi> what evil have I done that ſuch a man commends me?</p>

me now I am a dying, and know not what wil become of me? Oh I have no eaſe, no quietneſſe, What ſhall I do? Oh I cannot abide to ſee you, I cannot endure to look on you, you bring all my wickedneſſe to my mind. Thus it will be with thee, if God do but in the leaſt manner awaken thy ſecure conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Let the Uſe be, firſt of Admonition to you that are Parents, Maſters, Friends, or Neighbours, take heed of checking and quenching any little ſpark of a good moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that God may work in your children and ſervants: It is an heavy ſin to murther their bodies, but far greater to murther their ſouls, and yet thou doſt this, when thou canſt not abide to ſee in thy wife, child, or ſervant, any deſire to become a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Thou callſt it Melancholy, madneſs, folly, and thou deſpiſeſt it in thy heart. Oh know this is to act the Divels work in an high degree: As <hi>Herod</hi> ſought to kill Chriſt as ſoon as he was born, ſo thou endeavoureſt ſpiritually to kill Chriſt in the heart of him who is almoſt converted. There is too much of this diveliſh wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the world; men that had rather ſee their friends and neighbours, any thing in the world, then profeſſe godlineſſe.</p>

Of comfort to thoſe who will cleave to God, and follow Chriſt, though they have all the hatred of their friends, though parents, husbands, make them have a wearie and ſad life, yet they love Chriſt more then all: Oh bleſſed art thou above others, thou art a kinde of a Martyr; all the hardſhip and grief thou goeſt through for godlineſſe, it is a Martyrdom: The Scripture giveth thee many encouragements in this way.</p>
                  <p>Uſe 3. Of Exhortation to all thoſe who are intangled by evil companie, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly ſocietie. Oh come out of that <hi>Egypt,</hi> come from that <hi>Babylon;</hi> never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be Chriſts Diſciple till thou leave that accurſed followſhip.

Oh hadſt not thou better ſay to them, depart from me, I will know you no more, then have Chriſt ſay to thee, Depart into everlaſting fire, I know you not: And know godlineſſe will help thee to excellent companie, to excellent mirth: A good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is a continual feaſt: Thou wilt enjoy God, Chriſt will dwell with thee.

                  <p>WE have endeavored to make plain thoſe Mountains, that are in the way to our Converſion, and turning to God: Now it remaineth, that we exalt ſome Valleys, and remove thoſe diſcouragements that are on mens ſpirits, while in the general, they ſeem to deſire and purpoſe to turn unto God. I acknowledge, theſe valleys are not ſo many as the mountains; diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and dejections not ſo frequent, as preſumptious; more are fondly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the eaſineſs to turn to God, then the difficulty: which is clearly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced, by the ſecure and negligent diſpoſition of moſt, that though they hear never ſo much about this duty of turning to God, yet never conſider or apply, never make any matter, whether they are turned unto God or not. I will not be too long in enumeration of the uſual dejections in this kinde; I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in one or two, which will in effect ſerve for the reſt: And</p>

                     </gap>, that live but for a day; there comes up a worm, that quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſumes theſe gourds. The deſires of a man in his converſion, are compared to Hunger and Thirſt, to Panting and Breathing, all which are the moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and impatient motions of a man: Can a man be hungry, ready to be ſtarved, and ſit ſtill crying, O that I had food? no, it will break through ſtone walls. You ſee what the hungry Lepers did, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7. 8. deſperately ventured even into their enemies quarters, that they might be ſatisfied: And thus, if thy purpoſes and reſolutions were full and ſtrong, no luſt, no temptation could be ſo ſtrong as to hold thee any longer; but now they are half deſires, and faint wiſhes, and God hath made no promiſe to ſuch, that they ſhall be ſatisfied. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of himſelf before his converſion, how he had many deſires and reſolutions to leave his ſins, which made him pray to God, that God would give him grace to part with them, yet at that very time he was afraid (he ſaith) that God ſhould hear his prayers; he was afraid God ſhould do that for him, he deſired: And thus it may be with thee, thou haſt many affections and deſires to forſake thy ſins, frequent relentings, yet if it ſhould come to it indeed, that thou muſt be taken from them, it would be a trouble to thee; all which argueth, thou art not real, fully bent againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>As theſe purpoſes are but weak and faint, ſo it may be they are ſlaviſh in thee, extorted onely from outward conſiderations of danger and puniſhment, in fear</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>of death, and of publique judgements:</hi> Now if ſo, its no wonder if theſe thorns do not bear grapes: This is often in the Scripture exemplified, <hi>Ahab, Pharaoh,</hi> the Iſraelites; while the ſtrok of Gods judgements was upon them, then they would turn to God: Thus the Iſraelites turned and turned very often, but they turned from God again, as often as they turned unto him: Now the ground of this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriage was, becauſe theſe purpoſes were violently wrung from them, they dared not to do otherwiſe; and ſo when the cauſe was removed, the effect pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ceaſed. Look then, what it is that is the riſe of thy reſolutions; thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveſt and reſolveſt ſometimes, even with ſad and bitter tears, but thou art after wards where thou wert before; Is not this that which marreth all? Theſe reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions never are, but when thou art in ſome fears, in ſome terrors, and theſe violent things therefore will never hold long: They will hold as long as the principle of their violence holdeth; but when that ceaſeth, all thy purpoſes fall to the ground again. Never then wonder to ſee the Iſraelites commit thoſe idolatryes, and that injuſtice, which ſometimes they cryed out off, and confeſſed to God; for all this was ſqueezed from them, not willingly done by them: O then! if thou wouldſt at laſt ſee a ſweet harmony, between thy reſolution and converſation, begin to mend thy purpoſes; let them not be reſolves out of fear, but out of love: O Lord (ſay) not onely in time of danger, but in the midſt of all mercies and comforts, my ſoul breathes after thee: Its not fear of hell and death makes me take up theſe concluſions, but love to thee, and what is holy: Thou mayeſt be ſure, this will hold, thou wilt be the ſame, if this move thee firſt. Thou wilt be no longer, as the man that purgeth his ſhip, which leaketh, and water comes in at one place, as faſt as it is emptied at another; but thou haſt laid a good and ſure foundation to build upon.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Thy purpoſes vaniſh away without execution, becauſe it may be they art onely ſudden and flaſhy, they continue but for a ſeaſon:</hi> They come like ſuddain light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <note place="margin">3.</note> that makes an aſtoniſhment for the preſent, but immediately is gone: Thus <hi>Balaams</hi> deſires were upon a ſudden apprehenſion of Gods glorious providence to his Church. <hi>Agrippa</hi> was almoſt perſwaded to be a Chriſtian, for that time while <hi>Paul</hi> was preaching; ſo that thoſe purpoſes, which are not conſtant not rooted, will dye as ſoon as they begin to live. As our Saviour ſpeaks of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary ſaith which doth immediately ſpring up, and immediately wither; ſo <note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> theſe reſolutions, they do preſently riſe up, while we are preaching, and while you are hearing, but then as ſoon as the duty is over, thy purpoſes are over:
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:30767:242"/>
Therefore as <hi>David</hi> prayed for the people, that offered ſo willingly, <hi>God keep this always in their hearts,</hi> 1 Chron. 29. 18. ſo ſhouldſt thou, O Lord, not at this time onely, but always make my ſpirit thus reſolute, thus fixed againſt iniquity; let not theſe holy motions of thy good ſpirit dye within me. Its not the having of godly reſolutions to turn unto God, but the powerful retaining of them, and making uſe of them in time of need, that doth avail and help us: Why then art thou ſo diſquieted within thee? the cauſe is plain, thou mayeſt ſee clearly what is to be done: Let not thoſe reſolutions of thine, be as pilgrims and ſtrangers, that lodge but for a night; let them rather be as the fire upon the Altar, that never went out. As it is ſaid of the wicked man, that he cannot ſleep, till he hath accompliſhed his miſchieef; ſo do thou take no reſt, till the godly purpoſes of thy ſoul be fulfilled.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Thou complaineſt, that thou art driven from thy reſolutions to <note place="margin">4.</note> turn unto God: <hi>Then reſolve more in the grace and power of God,</hi> not in thy own humane ſtrength and confidence: This makes men fall again as often as they riſe, they think to ſtand by their own power. Certainly, if in ordinary common things, we may not peremptorily reſolve to do ſuch and ſuch things, but to expect his aid and providence, if God will; much more in ſpiritual duties: ſay then to all thy ſins, which have ſo frequently conquered thee, as <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Goliah, I come unto thee in the name of the Lord, whom thou haſt defied;</hi> I ſet upon the mortifying of theſe ſins, not by my own ſtrength, but in the power of Chriſt, whoſe glory and honor my ſins would take away. When <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent temperament of grace, <hi>He knew how to abound, and how to want;</hi> he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth, <hi>I can do all things through him that ſtrengtheneth me,</hi> Phil. 4. 13. over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come nature, remove mountains, make the dead to live; thus it will be with thee, if thou adheareſt to God. Alas, what can an hand do, if ſeparated from the body? what the branch, if divided from the vine? no more can thy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes or reſolutions, unleſs partaking of Chriſts influence: If therefore thou wouldſt not have yea and nay, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> excuſeth himſelf in another caſe, but thou wouldſt be ſetled in thy converſion to God, go out of thy own ſtrength, lean no more to thy own power, but cry out, Oh thy weakneſs, Oh thy impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, Oh the guile and falſhood of thy heart; there is no more truſting of it, no more believing in it; and therefore Lord, let thy right hand uphold me. Do as the little childe, that hath attempted to go alone, but finding it cannot, holds the father by his hand, and then he is not afraid to go. Do as <hi>Peter;</hi> when ready to ſink in the waters, then he cryeth out then Chriſt holds his hand out to ſuſtain him.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>If thou finde thy ſelf thus prone to break thy promiſes and reſolutions,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>this ſhould not ſo much diſhearten, as make thee the more wary and diligent:</hi> Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties do not diſhearten, but inflame a reſolved ſpirit, even as ſtirring doth the fire. If oppoſitions and temptations ſhould take away all hope and confidence? then every man might ſit down with fear in the way to heaven, and ſay truly with the ſluggard, <hi>A Lyon is in the way,</hi> yea, many Lyons; but God hath made the way to heaven narrow and ſtraight, that ſo we may the more ſtrive to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therein; and the violent muſt take heaven by force, even as the Iſraelites did the Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> So then, though thy turning to God, put thee in many agonies, many fears, ſometimes in hope, ſometimes again in deſpair; yet let not this make thee caſt away the Anchor of Hope, and ſay as they did, It is in vain to pray, to reſolve, to ſeek any longer: That expreſſion of the Apoſtle, calling <hi>Hope an Anchor,</hi> Heb. 6. 9. is excellent to this purpoſe. Would it not be a wilde mad thing in a Marriner, when the waves ariſe, and ſtrong guſts beat his ſhip back, if he ſhould in that conflict throw away his Anchor? no leſs is thy folly, while thou art thus unconſtantly toſſed up and down, ſometimes in high reſolutions towards Heaven, ſometimes as low as hell; thou caſteſt away thy hope, which onely would ſupport thee; Oh rather ſay, Theſe difficulties
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:30767:243"/>
arguue a duty of the greater watchfulneſs; there is more reaſon for me to watch and pray, to fear and pray.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Let that encourage thee, while climbing up this high hill, That God hath made gracious promiſes, even to the leaſt ſparks, the leaſt beginnings of any good in a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>man:</hi> How comfortable is that? <hi>The bruiſed reed he will not break, the ſmoaking flax he will not quench,</hi> Mat. 12. 20. as God ſaid about his Temple, <hi>None ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the day of ſmall things;</hi> ſo it is here, Let not ſmall things be deſpiſed: What is leſs then a grain of Muſtard-ſeed, and yet how quickly doth that overgrow other herbs! ſo that there is no doubt on Chriſts part, but that he is ready to draw thee, and to give legs to thee; the onely queſtion is, Whether thou doeſt ſeek him with thy whole heart? let that be, and the Miniſters of God may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thee, that he will make little ſparks flame into a great fire: There is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent promiſe in <hi>Iſaiah, The faint and weary ſhall renew their ſtrength like an Eagle,</hi> Iſa. 40. 30, 31, 32. Oh then, ſit down and meditate on theſe gracious promiſes that are made, even to the Hungry, to the Thirſty, to ſuch who ſeek, though they have not found; never doubt on Gods help, onely be ſure thou art ſincere and hearty in thy purpoſes, to turn unto him. Certainly, God that heareth the yong Ravens, and gives them food, will hear thoſe yong and infant crys and reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thine to better things.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>This may alſo greatly incourage thee, though thou haſt many foils, That grace is far more potent then ſin:</hi> Though thy ſins be pleaſant, be made na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <note place="margin">7.</note> to thee, though they grow up like weeds, of their own accord; and grace is a ſtranger, and a plant in an unnatural ſoil, while in thy heart, yet it is far ſtronger then thy ſtrongeſt corruptions; ſo that thy diſeaſes are not ſuch incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ones, but that grace is a medicine and plaiſter potent enough to help thee; there is balm in <hi>Gilead:</hi> For as Chriſt is ſtronger then the Devil, therefore he judgeth him, and caſteth him out of the ſtrong holds he had; ſo grace is more effectual then ſin: Fear not then to grapple with thy luſts, ſay not they are above me, they are to ſtrong for me; for the ſeed of God, whereby a man is born of God, is ſtronger then this. Hence faith is ſaid to overcome the world, 1 John 5. 4. and as for outward helps, Greater is he that is with us, then thoſe that are againſt us; ſo for inward help alſo, if thy ſin be great, let the power of grace be alſo apprehended greater: The houſe of <hi>David</hi> will grow greater, and the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> leſſer; make therefore thy arguments from without thy ſelf, not within; ſay, O Lord, thy grace can cure me, thy grace can deliver me out of this miry clay.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, Doeſt thou complain thy reſolutions take no effect, thou art ſtill where thou wert? conſider, if it be not, becauſe though thou purpoſeſt aganſt <note place="margin">8.</note> ſin, <hi>yet thou doeſt not abſtain from the occaſions of it;</hi> and if ſo, no marvel if it be labor in vain: Never think to turn to God from thy ſins, if thou doeſt not turn from the occaſion of them: Alas, if thon haſt not ſtrength to avoid the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of ſin; which is leſs? how canſt thou ſin it ſelf, which is the greater: He that reſolveth not to be burnt in the fire, will never come too near the flames; he that will not be inticed by the adulterous woman, muſt not come near her dwelling. <hi>Job</hi> that reſolved againſt uncleanneſs, made a covenant with his eyes. <hi>Paul</hi> that feared to be a caſt-away, kept down his body; thou mayeſt then eaſily ſee what undoeth thee: No marvel if the Bird that endeavoreth to fly up to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, fall down again, when a ſtring is on her foot: Thus thou haſt ſometimes heavenly reſolutions, heavenly meditations, but there is a ſtring on the foot, or rather a milſtone about the neck; and that is, the occaſion or temptation to ſome ſin, from which thou canſt not part: Separate thy ſelf therefore firſt from the occaſions of ſin, then the ſin will be more eaſily ſubdued; as the husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man firſt cuts away the under buſhes and brambles, before he layeth his ax to the root of the tree: This is ſo great a matter, that our Saviour teacheth us to pray, <hi>Not to be lead into temptation;</hi> he doth not ſay, lead into ſin, but tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:30767:243"/>
for that is opening the gate, that is the firſt tumbling down the hill, and it is hard to ſtop afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, to quicken thee in thy reſolutions to turn unto God, though thou <note place="margin">9.</note> often get falls; <hi>Conſider what the ſtrong appetites and purpoſes of men in natural and worldly things put them upon. Thoſe that will be rich,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>pierce themſelves through with divers cares,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 9. Their earneſt deſire after theſe things, puts them upon all labor and toil day and night; every difficulty is eaſily devoured, <hi>per mare, per terras, &amp;c.</hi> they compaſs ſea and land, and all to poſſeſs themſelves of theſe fading riches. Take the ambitious man, that hath a boundleſs and vaſt deſire after honor and greatneſs, he doth not onely reſolve and reſolve, but is very induſtrious to compleat his deſigns: Take the malicious man, how unquiet in his ſleep, how reſtleſs in his thoughts, till he hath vented his poyſon! Now ſhall men in ſinful and unlawful ways, not onely imagine wickedly; but conſtantly and effectually practiſe it? and ſhalt not thou be as active in the ways of godlineſs? Never then let this temptation binde thee hand and foot; and certainly if thy converſion to God could never be attained, if thy turning to him were impoſſible, yet its better and more ſafe to dye in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and conflicts with theſe luſts, then out of diffidence to give up thy ſelf a priſoner to them: Its more noble to go lame to the grave, with thy ſtruglings againſt thy dear corruptions, then to become a voluntary ſlave to them.</p>

                  <p>IN the former part of this Chapter, you have an injunction laid by God on <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah,</hi> and the execution of it. The injunction and execution, is in going down to the Potters houſe, and beholding a work upon the wheels which was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, the Potter made it another veſſel, as it ſeemed good to him. This was a Type, or outward viſible ſign, in a lively and ocular manner to repreſent the power, Soveraignty, and Omnipotency of God, in reſpect of all Kingdomes and States, and more particularly of that of Iſrael.

The ſame Hebrew word is uſed for the evil we do, and the evil God doth, though they differ exceedingly; ſo that we ſee God preacheth not only by his word, but by his works. His turnings of a Kingdome by Wars and others judgements, is to cauſe our turnings: God removeth a peoples peace, mercies, and externall good things, that they might remove far from them all their evil things.

Now this is a great matter; for ſuch is mans Atheiſm, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane ſecurity, that he conceiveth of God, as keeping himſelf within the circle of heaven, and not acting and governing the world by his providence here below. The Church was better taught, when in her Captivity and other judgements, ſhee makes her moans, but ſtill looks over all inſtruments to God, <hi>Why haſt thou, O God, caſt us off? and why art thou angry with us?</hi> Pſal. 74. 1. <hi>Job</hi> alſo was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taught when he conſiders, not the <hi>Sabeans,</hi> but God ſpoyling him of all his comforts, <hi>The Lord hath given and the Lord hath taken, Job.</hi> 1. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>This phraſe,</hi> to frame evil, <hi>ſuppoſeth Gods Soveraignty, and omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent power over all people.</hi> He can as eaſily deſtroy a flouriſhing happy Kingdom, as
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:30767:246"/>
the potter can mar his veſſel on the wheels, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41. how excellently is God deſcribed in his majeſty and greatneſs, holding all the world in his hand, <hi>Ut homo nidum,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian,</hi> as a man doth a birds neſt; yea, all the nations of the world are but a drop, but as ſmall duſt, as nothing, yea leſs then nothing: Oh what little cauſe have men to truſt in greatneſs, power, forces, fenced cities and ſtrong places, when they are but as ſo much duſt, when God breatheth on them! and it is as impoſſible for any earthly power or greatneſs to ſubſiſt and keep from ruine, when God is angry, as duſt to lie ſtill in the air, when a ſtormy wind doth ariſe: Well then might <hi>Jeremy</hi> cry out, <hi>Jer. 10. Who would not fear thee, O King of the Nations?</hi> Let us not then account any thing great but God; we are clay, and he is the potter: And as it may diſcourage, when we are a ſinful people, though overſlowing in all external mercies; ſo it may incourage a people when converted, though in a deſolate confuſion, for God can make this rude clay, a glorious veſſel of honor; he can make dry bones to become living men: Here is his Soveraignty extolled in this phraſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>It argueth, that God can ſuddenly and quickly bring judgements upon men:</hi> Gods wonderful works of his wrath, are not onely ſeen in the matter he <note place="margin">3.</note> doth, but alſo in the manner: On a ſudden, in a moment calamities riſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any man thought or looked for them; even as the Church ſaith, <hi>When he turned their captivity, they were as men in a dream,</hi> Pſal. 126. 1. ſo when he brings their captivity alſo: Hence you have the expreſſion in this Chapter, <hi>At what inſtant I ſpeak to a land to pull it down, or build it up:</hi> He can do thoſe things in an inſtant, which humane power could not produce in many years. <hi>I create light and darkneſs, Creatio fit in inſtanti</hi> they ſay; God makes the deluge of his wrath to overflow in an inſtant: Thus he overthrew <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha</hi> on a ſudden; and that wonderful work of God, in bringing dead bodies out of the grave to appear before his Tribunal, will be in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 52. ſo that when God is ſaid <hi>to frame evil againſt a people,</hi> it implieth, that he can bring this in a moment, on a ſudden, before men think it poſſible. How often doth the Prophet tell them, <hi>That their miſeries ſhall come upon them as travel upon a woman with childe:</hi> Oh how ſhould this make every wicked man ſpeedily turn from his evil ways, for God can bring his judgements on thee in a moment; thou mayeſt have no time, no ſpace to bewail thy ſins, but his anger will conſume thee in the twinkling of an eye; yet how ſecurely do men live in open rebellion againſt God? how do they put far off from them the evil day? They put it far off in their thoughts, when God puts it very near in reality upon them: Could men eat and drink, and riſe up to play, if they did conſider how obnoxious they are to the ſharp arrows of God, which may be ſhot into their hearts every hour? who can tell thee what evil the next day, the next night, the next hour, may bring upon thee?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Gods framing of evil, as the Potter doth his clay, doth denote an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility to reſiſt, and to eſcape his judgements:</hi> Can the clay refuſe the Potters <note place="margin">4.</note> hand? no more can wicked men Gods Government, whereby he puniſheth wicked men for their ſins: There is no running from God, <hi>If thou getteſt into heaven or hell,</hi> as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>his right hand will finde thee out,</hi> Pſal. 139. 8. God tells <hi>Lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If then God prepare and frame evil againſt thee, its not all the policy or power in the world can ſecure thee. Who art thou, O piece of clay, O mortal man, duſt and aſhes, that thou ſhouldſt be able to flee from Gods anger, when it purſueth thee?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>As it argueth irreſiſtableneſs, ſo a neceſſity of ſubmitting and yielding</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>to him;</hi> Not to ſtrive or repine at his chaſtiſements: Thus the Scripture often, <hi>Shall the potſheard riſe up againſt the Potter, and ſay, Why madeſt thou me ſo?</hi>
                     <pb n="445" facs="tcp:30767:246"/>
Rom. 9. 21. <hi>The fooliſhneſs of a man perverteth his way, and his heart fretteth againſt the Lord:</hi> Thus when we by our evil deeds cauſe Gods wrath to fall upon us, we are ready to ſay with the Jews, <hi>His ways are not equal;</hi> its part of the ſin and puniſhment which the damned have in hell, that they curſe, and rage, and blaſpheme God continually: Oh take heed of being like the damned in hell, fretting at that evill which God frames againſt thee! Do thou, as <hi>Ieremy</hi> here, <hi>Go down into the field of the potter, and conſider the clay there:</hi> Remember thy own ſelf, thy duſt, thy clay, and thy ſins; all which will make thee not open thy mouth, becauſe God doth it. How ſhould this humble the proud and lofty ſpirits of haughty and obſtinate ſinners? God he frames his judgements againſt thee, and can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> thou refuſe them? muſt thou not yield the back to his ſcourges and blows? why ſhould a living man complain, a man for the puniſhment of his ſins, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>This phraſe doth imply, how unwilling God is to exerciſe his wrath which</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>he hath purpoſed;</hi> for here he tells the Iſraelites, <hi>He frameth and deviſeth evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them,</hi> as his purpoſe and reſolution; <hi>therefore let them return from their evil ways,</hi> to prevent the actual pouring out of his wrath: Thus in the former part of the Chapter, God ſpeaks to a people about pulling them down, before he doth indeed deſtroy them. To frame and purpoſe evil, is not preſently to bring evil; No, if that people, againſt whom it is framed, repent of their evil practiſed, God will of his evil framed and reſolved on: Thus God ſpeaks of <hi>Whetting his glistering Sword,</hi> before he run it into the bowels; and he is ſaid <hi>to roar like a Lyon, which giveth warning before he tear in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</hi> The Prophet expreſſeth this way of God excellently, when having inſtanced in what judgements God purpoſed to viſit them with, <hi>And becauſe I will do this, prepare to meet thy God, O Iſrael,</hi> Amos 4. 12. Take thou our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors counſel, <hi>Agree with thy adverſary in the way, before he hale thee to the judge, and thou be condemned,</hi> Mat. 5. 25. from whence thou canſt never be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived: So that this expreſſion of framing evil, ſignifieth much love, goodneſs, and unwillingneſs of God actually to deſtroy.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>To frame evil, and deviſe it, doth excellently repreſent the juſtice</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">7.</note> 
                     <hi>of God, that he dealeth with men according to their wickedneſs;</hi> for as this people would not turn to God, but go after the devices and imaginations of their own heart; ſo God he will imagine and deviſe from his heart evil againſt them; ſo that its a very ſutable expreſſion to thoſe wicked men. As in another place, when the Iſraelites were ſo obſtinate, that they would walk in the way which they ſhould chooſe; God to anſwer them, tells them, <hi>He would alſo chooſe out their deluſions,</hi> Iſa. 66. 4. ſo true is that of <hi>Pſal. 18. With the froward thou wilt ſhew thy ſelf froward:</hi> So that this ſhould exceedingly humble and terrifie wicked men, for God will ſhape out puniſhments, and frame out ſuch judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that will be very anſwerable and proportionable to thy wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, <hi>To frame evil, and deviſe it, implyeth the wiſdom of God:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, That he afflicts in counſel and deliberation (to ſpeak after the manner <note place="margin">8. 1.</note> of men) not in ſudden, irregular paſſion; he frameth it, he deviſeth it: Thus when God was to deſtroy the whole world, he ſaith, <hi>Let us go down and ſee whether it be ſo or no:</hi> Theſe are expreſſions to humane capacity, to ſhew how juſt and wiſe God is in all the calamities he brings upon a people. When <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſius</hi> had in cruel paſſion, cauſed the people of <hi>Theſſalonica</hi> to be put to the ſword, for ſome offence done againſt him, <hi>Ambroſe</hi> would not admit him to the Sacrament, till he had repented of that cruel paſſion; and withal, made a law, that when any man was condemned to death, there ſhould be thirty days re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite between ſentence and execution, that ſo nothing might be done in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Gods wiſdom is ſeen, in that its not every kinde of judgement
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:30767:247"/>
he takes, but what is fit for his end he propounds: As the Potter doth not make every veſſel in one ſhape, but one one way; another, another, as his uſe is of it, Thus God ſheweth wonderful wiſdom, in the variety of his afflictions, one is one way exerciſed, another, another; becauſe they come not at random, but are framed by God, at his pleaſure. Hence <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. he is ſaid to watch over evil, to bring it upon them. God watcheth over evil, to ſhew that he conſiders what is the fitteſt judgement, what is the fitteſt ſeaſon, who are the fitteſt ſubjects: Oh how well is it, that the framing and deviſing of all evil, is not in the Devils hands, and wicked mens hands! they indeed frame evil, and deviſe malicious devices; but they are onely inſtruments, every way limited, in power, in time and place, and therefore they cannot devour as they deſire: And thus much for the phraſe, <hi>To frame and deviſe evil, when attributed to God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next place, conſider briefly, why judgements and afflictions are <note place="margin">Why judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are called evil.</note> called evil; For is not God juſt in diſpenſing of them? Are not his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments righteous and holy? Do not the people of God with much joy and praiſe, acknowledge them? why then ſhould they be called evil? This hath ſtruck ſo much upon ſome of the Ancients, <hi>Arnobius</hi> and others, that they thought onely that good came from God, which was pleaſant and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and that theſe bitter ſore afflictions, come onely <hi>Permiſſivè,</hi> as the Orthodox ſay, about the evil of ſin: And the error about this, made the <hi>Marcionites</hi> hold two firſt and chief principles: One Good, from whom came onely good; the other Evil and wicked, from whom came onely evil: But the Scripture is very clear, and the Prophets are very diligent to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, That all the judgements they lay under, were brought by God upon them for their ſins.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, <hi>They are called evil, becauſe though in their nature and uſe, the good fruits of Gods juſtice, yet they deprive us of our temporal and ſpiritual</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                     <hi>good we might enjoy:</hi> So that as the happineſs and quietneſs we might have in body and ſoul, is truly called Good; ſo that which depriveth us of theſe, may well be called evil. Thus the Prophet, <hi>Your iniquities withhold good things from you,</hi> Jer. 5. 25. Oh how ſhould this, if not the love of God, make thee ſet againſt thy ſin; for its that which depriveth thee of all temporal and ſpiritual good; its that which turneth all thy honey into gall, all thy wine into vinegar, all thy bread into a ſtone.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It may well be called evil, becauſe its the fruit of that which is truly evil.</hi> The evil of puniſhment is the neceſſary daughter of the evil of ſin; <note place="margin">2.</note> now it is uſual to call any effect by the name of the cauſe, and nothing is more ordinary in Scripture, to call both ſin it ſelf, and the puniſhment of ſin, by the name of ſin: Thus ſin is ſaid <hi>to lie at the door,</hi> Gen. 4. 7. <hi>Chriſt became ſin for us,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. <hi>Your ſin will finde you out,</hi> Numb. 32. 23. that is, ſin and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: So that no man may commit the evil of ſin, with hope to eſcape the evil of puniſhment, for they are both chained together.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>They are evil, becauſe upon all men naturally where they fall, if not prevented by grace, they draw out their evil, they make them more wicked, as we may</hi>

They are as Garlike, and other unſavory herbs, the more they are pounced, the worſe is their ſmell.</p>
                  <p>But although they be called evil, yet they are nothing ſo evil, as the evil of ſin. The breach of Gods law, the offence done to his Majeſty, is infinitely a <note place="margin">Sin the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  <p>THe Doctrine gathered from theſe words is, <hi>That God purpoſeth evil and calamities againſt a people, that they might return from their wicked ways.</hi> In this point three things are to be conſidered; 1. <hi>That God frameth all calamities. 2.

The third thing which remaineth is, <hi>That Gods end in all theſe exerciſes, is to make men turn from their ſins:</hi> Converſion is the end of all Gods ſcourges and ſtripes; if men did throw away their evil, God would quickly burn his rod.

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That Gods afflictions upon a people, may be branched into three heads:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Afflictions branched into three heads.</note> ſome are firſt meerly <hi>exploratory,</hi> or by way of tryal, to draw out a Chriſtians graces, and to encreaſe his glory Thus perſecutions and troubles for the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, impriſonment and Martyrdom; theſe were not ſo much evil framed by God, to make them turn from their ſins; but conflicts and combates appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God, for his choice and valiant Champions, that ſo they might receive the greater weight of glory: And hence the people of God are commanded <hi>to account it all joy, when they fall into ſuch temptations,</hi> James 1. for what the fire is to the droſs, the water to a ſpotty garment, the winnowing to the wheat, the ſame are theſe combates to them, they ſtrengthen their graces, they weaken their luſts, and they advance their glory; ſo that the ignorance of this end, doth ſometimes put Gods children into great perplexities; for becauſe they fall frequently under Gods afflictions, no ſooner is one over, but another ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, like the waves of the ſea; they begin to doubt preſently about the main, they call the very foundations into queſtion, Why doth God thus follow me with loſſes and troubles? is it not becauſe I am an hypocrite? may I not fear the great work of converſion is yet to be done? But this is a temptation; had not <hi>Iob</hi> been well exerciſed to diſcern between good and evil; theſe very tempra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had broken his heart.</p>
                  <p>A Second branch of Chaſtiſements, <hi>are indeed for ſin, and flow from Gods an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>

                     <hi>but they are wholly medicinal:</hi> They are to let blood, like the Phyſitian who intends health; not like the Butcher, who is to deſtroy; and theſe by the Scripture are called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, becauſe God would diſcipline us by them as children, not puniſh us as condemned malefactors.</p>
                  <p>And if you ſay, <hi>How can theſe be for converſion, when ſometimes they fall upon thoſe that are converted, ſuch as are made Gods children already?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Queſt.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>To Anſwer this, you muſt remember what was ſaid heretofore, that even thoſe who are converted, do yet need daily to draw nigher and nigher to God; <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> they are to be converted daily from thoſe frequent corruptions, which eſtrange them from God; and thus when Gods own people have their afflictions, they are to conſider, Is not this to turn me nearer to God? is there not ſuch pride, ſuch dulneſs and coldneſs in the ſervice of God, that I am to be turned from? Well, its clear, to Gods own children, they are thus medicinal; but by the Texts forementioned, and in ſeveral other places, its alſo evident, that even to thoſe who are ſinners, and remain in an unconverted eſtate, God reacheth out his gracious offer in their troubles: That as it is ſaid of ſeveral <hi>Pſalms,</hi> which more principally contain the ſubjects of affliction, <hi>A Pſalm to give underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> ſo ſhouldſt thou write, as it were, upon every trouble, upon every af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, <hi>An affliction to give underſtanding.</hi> Do not Phyſitians command men diſtracted, and out of their wits, to be kept in dark dungeons, to be bound in ſtraight chains and fetters, to have hard and miſerable fare, that ſo by all this hardſhip, they may come to their underſtandings again? thus God doth, Men by their ſins are turned mad, they are grown out of their right reaſon; they indeed think ſtrictneſs and preciſeneſs is the way to make men out of their wits; but thy luſts and thy wickedneſs, deprive thee of all ſound judgement; now God, that he may recover thee, bindes thee in chains, afflicts thee with ſeveral judgements, that ſo at laſt thou mayeſt ſeriouſly conſider of thy ſelf, and thy condition: ſo that there was never any trouble befell thee, but thou ſhouldſt make as good uſe of it, as ever thou didſt of the beſt ſermon thou haſt heard.
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:30767:248"/>
Hence <hi>Pariſienſis</hi> will not call theſe afflictions evil, but good; and therefore divides Gods diſpenſations into <hi>Bona Attractionis,</hi> and <hi>Bona Retractionis;</hi> Good things drawing or attractive, theſe are Gods mercies; good things withdrawing or retractive from ſin, and theſe are afflictions.</p>
                  <p>But thirdly, <hi>There are ſome judgements of God for ſin, wherein God doth not aim at converſion, but utter ruine:</hi> Therefore when we ſay, God by his calamities, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends <note place="margin">3.</note> the converſion of men; it is not to be underſtood univerſally, not of all men, nor at all times; God hath ſome judgements which are called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, puniſhments and torments, which proceed from the meer hatred and implacable enmity of God; and ſo converſion is no more intended by theſe, then the flames and torments in hell are appointed to convert, or to bring the damned to repentance: Thus was the overthrow of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> fire and brimſtone was a fit declaration of the hell they had deſerved; and although it may not be peremptorily ſaid, that all the whole world that periſhed ſave eight perſons, were all damned, for that is diſputed among the Learned; yet its plain, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part were incurably wicked, and ſo the deluge, though of water, was not to waſh their ſins, but God did firſt throw them into water, and then into e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal fire preſently; and wo be to thoſe wicked men, to whom their miſeries here are but the beginning of ſorrows hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Now we may obſerve a difference between theſe penal, deſtructive evils, and <note place="margin">The difference between penal evils, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal. 1.</note> healing medicinal ones, in theſe reſpects:</p>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Afflictions are converting, and not deſtructive, when God doth vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe inward teachings of the ſoul, inward meltings and humiliations of the ſpirit</hi>

Conſider then, doth the rod give thee wiſdom and underſtanding? doth God ſpeak wiſdom to thy heart, while thy outward man is ſo ſharply exerciſed? then theſe things come from love, and will end in love: Oh this undoeth us in out calamities! we attend to the outward burthen, and grievous nature of them, we ask, When will they be gone? we cry out, How long Lord? but wenever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:30767:249"/>
that we are by our calamities in Gods School; we conſider not, neither do we hearken to what God ſaith unto us; look then to have teaching, as well as ſtriking: Oh woe be to that man, whom God onely beats and beats, but teacheth him not at all: This is a forerunner of ſad deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Having premiſed theſe things, I come to ſhew in the next place, how Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <note place="margin">How afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of men Not of their own nature.</note> are operative to the converſion of men, what influence they have to make us turn to God: And here are two Errors to be avoided:</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, as if afflictions of their own nature, in their own ſelf, could beget any ſuch heavenly change upon men: No ſuch matter, for if the Word of God it ſelf, and the Sacraments, if deſtitute of Gods ſpirit and his power, are uneffectual, how much more muſt theſe outward calamities be? Therefore as <hi>Ezekiels</hi> wheels could not move, unleſs the Spirit drive them; nor the pool of <hi>Betheſda</hi> communicate health, unleſs the Angel deſcended and ſtirred the waters; ſo neither do any afflictions or troubles at all, do any good, but where Gods ſpirit moveth upon theſe waters. Experience confirmeth this, How many times do people grow more deſperate, more obſtinate and impenitent in every evil way, by the judgements upon them? The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> complaineth of them, <hi>O Lord, when thy hand is lifted up they will not ſee,</hi> Iſa, 26. 11. <hi>Though a fool be brayed in a morter, yet he will not learn wiſdom,</hi> Prov. 27. 22.</p>
                  <p>The Second Error to be avoided, is to attribute any merit or worth to a pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <note place="margin">Nor by way of merit for the patient bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them.</note> bearing of afflictions, as if by this we could merit either grace or glory. The Apoſtle indeed ſaith of Afflictions, <hi>That they do work an eternal weight of glory,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 17. but the word doth not there ſignifie a proper cauſality, onely God doth make afflictions advantagious for his children glory: Do not then think, that becauſe thou haſt a miſerable life here, God is bound to make thee amends in the life to come: Thoſe that ſay ſuch things, know not that their ſins have deſerved all wrath in this world, and the world to come. This ſtone being removed out of the way, I proceed to deſcribe the manner how theſe outward calamities may further converſion.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, <hi>They are very advantagious to ſet the word preached upon our hearts:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">But firſt by ſetting the word preached upon our hearts.</note> 
                     <hi>I ſpake unto thee in thy proſperity, ſaith God, but thou heardeſt not,</hi> Jer. 22. 21. The word of God is never ſo likely to have a powerful impreſſion, as when men are in miſeries; then their proud ſpirits, their lofty hearts are tamed: As the rod in the ſchool, and diſcipline makes inſtruction eaſily enter into the negligent childe; ſo when God teacheth you by his word, and afflicts you by his works, this may provoke to converſion: Doth God therefore put thee in this fiery fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace? ſay, This is to bring all that hath been preached to me to my minde; God hath a ſpecial regard to his word, it is the precious ſeed ſown, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ploweth and harroweth the ground; he afflicts and humbles Hearers, that they may get good by it: This is the proper uſe of all chaſtiſements, to make way for the word preached, to mollifie and ſoften, that it may enter; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what hearers are more obſtinate and oppoſite to the word, then ſuch as live in jollity and ſecurity, that have their hearts eaſe? Theſe have a fat heart, and ſo are not ſenſible.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Affliction helpeth much to make men ſober and wiſe, to give our ſelves to underſtanding;</hi> and by underſtanding we come to be converted. <hi>Solomon</hi> often <note place="margin">2. Afflictions help to make men ſober and wiſe.</note> tells us, <hi>That the rod gives wiſdom;</hi> and therefore God takes this way with us, we being far more ſtupid and ſenſeleſs in ſpiritual things, then any childe can be to humane Learning: Now when God depriveth us of our joy, of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, of all outward delights, this is apt to make a man to conſider the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all things, What are Riches, what are Honors, what are External mercies to be me thus afflicted, thus broken and bruiſed? When thou rebukeſt man for his ſin, all his deſireable things periſh; when then God takes away the deſire of thy eyes, the deſire of thy heart, this is to make thee wiſe; as you take away the childes babies, to make it learn its leſſon: Its better to go to the houſe of
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:30767:249"/>
mourning then laughter, for the living will lay it to heart. The Prodigal never came to his true minde, till he was brought to bitter extremity: Oh then, if thou finde Gods hand heavy upon thee, ſay, This is the time to get wiſdom, ſpeak now Lord, for my heart is ready to hear: If thou doeſt not know more, and underſtand more then ever, thou loſeſt the benefit of thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Affliction may further converſion, in that it doth ſenſibly teach a man, how</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. By ſenſibly teaching a man how ſad and bitter a thing it is to ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God.</note> 
                     <hi>ſad and bitter a thing it is to ſin againſt God:</hi> Sin is compared to gall and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, but it is never perceived to be ſo, till God bring us into external miſeries: Thus <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Jer. 2. 19. <hi>Then ſhall ye know, it is a bitter thing to depart from God:</hi> Therefore though men in jollity and outward eaſe, never think of turning unto God, yet how is it that you refuſe, whoſe ſins have found you out. Theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents have now put out their ſtings upon you; you finde your iniquities no longer ſmiling on you, no longer tickling and pleaſing of you, but they have ſaid you in a tormenting bed of ſorrow: Thou haſt received thy good things, but now thy time is come for evil things: Every man doth quickly ſettle upon his lees, if he be not removed from affliction to affliction: How fit then and congruous is it for that man, who lieth under the ſmart of his ſins, to depart from them! What is the cauſe of thy preſent miſery, of thy preſent troubles? is it not ſin? What hath brought thee into that deep gulf thou art in? is it not ſin? What hath turned all thy waters into blood, as it was with the <hi>Egyptians?</hi> all thoſe comforts and delights thou uſeſt to refreſh thy ſelf with? is it not ſin? Then why doeſt thou not ſay? If ſin make all this evil, if that bring all this miſery, why ſhall I imbrace it any louger? And a Chriſtian will further argue, If theſe beginnings be ſo heavy, what will the after end be? if in this life it ſting and wound ſo deeply, what will it in the life to come? What is hell and the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting flames thereof, if now ſin be ſo terrible?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>In this afflictions may alſo prepare for converſion, becauſe they are apt</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. They are apt to dead a mans heart to all creature-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights.</note> 
                     <hi>to dead a mans heart, and all his delights that he took in the creatures:</hi> Sin is an averſion from God, and converſion to the creature; now grace is an averſion from ſin, and converſion to God; and there is nothing doth ſo prepare and take off the heart from the creature, as when God afflicts us in them, and by them. As then the breaſt is made bitter, to wean the child; ſo God puts bitterneſs in every comfort, in every condition, makes affliction to grow up with every mercy, a thorn with every flower; that ſo thou mayeſt ſay, Its not good to be here, we muſt ſeek a better good then theſe things are: <hi>In their afflictions they will ſeek me early,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 5. 15. Oh when God ſhall make every thing bryars and thorns to thee! when thou lookeſt for good, and behold nothing but bitterneſs, now is the time to allure thy ſoul to God; ſay, What wilt thou do? whether wilt thou go? Hath not that Star wormwood fallen into every ſtate thou art in? Hath not God bid thee be called no more <hi>Naomi,</hi> but <hi>Marah:</hi> Why then doeſt thou any longer ſeek for grapes on thorns; for true happineſs in the way of ſin? God took the Church into the wilderneſs, and then he ſpake to her, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. 14. Oh when God hath brought thee into a wilderneſs, all comforts are kept from thee, then take the advantage, then pray, then mourn; now, if ever, that iron of thy heart is in the fire, and it may be beaten into a good frame; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more univerſal thy affliction is, if it takes thee off from all refuges, leaveth thee not one drop of comfort, the likelier it is to do thee good, for thy ſpiritual diſeaſe and corruption is contumelious, that it muſt be ſtrong phyſick, elſe it will not work on thee: As long as thou canſt catch upon any twig, any branch to ſave thy ſelf, thou wilt not throw thy ſelf into the arms of Chriſt: Therefore God hedged the Churches way with thorns, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. 6. that ſhe might not any way break through for her ſins; and when ſhe was thus ſtopped, then ſhe reſolveth to go back to her former husband again. Thus afflictions in theſe particulars may help on our turning to God, not but that the word is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:30767:250"/>
inſtrument, onely this may ſmooth and prepare the way for the word to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; inſomuch that a man, who hath no afflictions, and who liveth in all the eaſe and delight of his ſoul, he may be in a deſperate condition, and moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, though he bleſs himſelf. Its related of <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> that being in the houſe of a man who boaſted he never had any calamity in all his life; Come, ſaith he, let us make haſte out of this houſe, leſt ſome remarkable vengeance of God fall upon us: He thought thoſe were moſt unhappy, that had ſo much earthly happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Nihil infelicius ſemper felici.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here is one doubt to be anſwered, and that is, Why ſhould men be preſſed in times of calamities and miſeries to turn unto God, ſeeing that is uſually brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> for hypocriſie; all is out of fear, and extorted, and ſo not thank worthy: If <hi>Iſrael</hi> return to God, becauſe he is framing evil againſt them, its meerly for fear of evil, and not love of God, or what is good. Doth not the Prophet call the Iſraelites faſtings and mournings, when they were under Gods judgements, by no other name, then howlings, as if they were ſo many beaſts kept up in a den, ready to be famiſhed, that cryed for food onely, Why then ſhould this be urged upon us?</p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, <hi>Theſe calamities must be the occaſion onely and initial motive;</hi> they muſt prepare and make way, but they muſt not be the principal ground, nor the <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> onely: Even as the needle draweth on the thread; or as in matter of faith, the true Churches Authority, makes way to receive the truth of God, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards we believe for the divine Authority thereof; ſo theſe outward miſeries, they give the firſt hint, they begin to make the firſt ſhake, but afterwards the ſoul forſakes ſin, and cleaveth to God, not out of fear onely, but love to him: We do not therefore preſs you, to make your afflictions the onely ground, but let them be ſanctified introductions: And ſo I proceed to the Uſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That no man hath cauſe to boaſt and rejoyce of his outward proſperity, that he is not afflicted as others, he liveth and is dandled, as it were, in the worlds <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> lap: Who knoweth, but that this is the fatting of thee for the ſhambles? Who can ſay, but that God is moſt angry with thee, while he ſeemeth not to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry: Oh how much better were it, that God did follow thee by one affliction after another, by one miſery after another; this great calm is but the forerunner of a terrible ſtorm; know ſin hath it ſtings, and it will one time or other be ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible. As its ſaid, the Magiſtrates hath not the ſword in vain; ſo neither are all thoſe threatnings, all thoſe arrows and ſwords of Gods vengeance in vain, <hi>But who believeth our report?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, That we the people of <hi>England,</hi> of any Nation in the world, ſhould be a converted generation to him: It ſhould be matter of amazement and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> if every ſinner be not turned from his evil ways; for God hath not onely framed evil againſt us, but poured it on us; he hath not onely whet his gliſtering ſword, but run it in our bowels; the Lyon hath not onely roared, but torn in pieces: In vain do we ſpeak and hope of Gods turning his wrath from us, till we have turned from our iniquities: We look not to the true cauſe of all our judgements; the ſins we lie in, we live in; the ſins that every Town and Village walloweth in, theſe have been our undoing: Oh then you who ſay, Your have loſt thus much and thus much by the times, be able to ſay, You have loſt your ſins alſo, and found God.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THe Prophets Commiſſion conſiſted of two parts, The firſt Inſtruction. The ſecond Exhortation. We are upon this latter, and in it are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved 1. The duty, <hi>Return;</hi> the nature of which hath been already diſcuſſed. 2. The time now, <hi>Return now.</hi> 3. The term from which, with the appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, <hi>Every man from his evill way.</hi> 4. The extent alſo of it, <hi>From your evil doings.</hi> The next thing in our method to be handled is, the time when this duty muſt be ſet upon, and that is now <hi>Turn ye now.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From whence Obſerve, <hi>That Converſion or turning unto God, is a duty required at the preſent time.</hi> Thus in other places parallel in the margent, where this duty is often commanded; ſtill the time is prefixed now, <hi>Return ye now.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For opening of this neceſſary practical point, Conſider <note place="margin">Man is prone to put of the day of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That it is a very prone inbred thing in a man to procraſtinate, and still to put off the day of repentance, and converſion to God.</hi> He reſolveth, and he purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and he hopes in God to do it, and God gives him grace to do it, but he never ſets upon the work. Do but commune with your own hearts, and ſee if there be not ſomething or other ready alwaies to ſtiſle and kill thoſe purpoſes to return and ſo thou art alwaies delaying, and delaying, hoping for a time at laſt, till it may be thou falleſt into the grave, and ſo all thy hopes cut off. Now the cauſes of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay to turn to God, may be ſeveral: <hi>Sometimes it may come from ſluggiſhneſſe and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Cauſes of mens delays to turn to God. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>idlneſſe:</hi> Even as the ſluggard hath a deſire to eat, but he tolleth himſelf on the bed, and ſaith, <hi>Yet a little ſleep, and a little ſlumber,</hi> and ſo he refuſeth to ſet his hand to work. Thus it is here, he deſireth to part with his corruptions, to ſin no more, but then he cryeth a little more eaſe; ſo much praying, ſo much hearing, ſo much humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, ſo much fervencie and violence is very tedious to him: <hi>The kingdome of heaven is to be got by violence,</hi> Mat. 11. 12. and the way to heaven, is ſtriving, runinng in a race, wreſtling and combating, all which the idle man will never doe.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond cauſe is, <hi>Dear, and exceſſive love to the luſts we live in, when we have at</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>the ſame time ſome conviction, and yet ſtrong corruptions.</hi> Conviction that it is high time for us to break off our ſins by repentance, and yet ſtrong corruptions do ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice us, and perſwade us, that we are not able to break theſe bonds, and caſt them aſunder, then converſion is delayed. Thus <hi>Agrippa</hi> was almoſt perſwaded to be a Chriſtian, <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 28. but yet his preſent luſts with-held him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="454" facs="tcp:30767:251"/>
The third <hi>Cauſe of delay to turn unto God may be, the immoderate and exceſſive love, and cares of the things of this world.</hi> Thoſe are apt to ſurfet, and over-charge the <note place="margin">3.</note> heart: this duſt got into the eye, is apt to blinde them. Thus the young man that ſeemed ſo forward, when he was bid to ſell all, could not bear that Doctrine, but went away very ſorrowful, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 22.</p>
                  <p>A fourth <hi>Cauſe, may be recovery out of ſome dangers, diſeaſes, or calamities that we were in.</hi> The Iſraelites often turned unto God, but they proved deceitful, they went <note place="margin">4.</note> backward, as well as forward, and what was the matter? They would turn to God from violent fears that were upon them; they then cryed, and mourned, and prayed unto the Lord; but this fountain preſently dryed up when a ſun-ſhine day came. So that proſperity and freedom from trouble, makes a man pur off his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, as much as ever he put them on in times of adverſitie. Thus you ſee what are the cauſes that may make men uſe that <hi>Corvinumcras,</hi> as <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls it, <hi>The Crows note,</hi> Cras, <hi>to morrow, to morrow.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Conſider, that it is an high, and a very grievous ſin, for a man obſtinately and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">It is a grievous ſin to reſolve to turn to God, but not yet.</note> 
                     <hi>formally to have this expreſſion, I will turn to God, but not yet.</hi> I ſay to have this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, and not with attention to it, it argueth very great rebellion, for it ſuppoſeth light in thee; thou ſeeſt thy ſelf out of the way, thou ſeeſt thy ſelf undone, and wandring in waies to hell, yet thy rebellion againſt this light is ſo great and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that thou wilt oppoſe it: beſides it argueth much contempt; for if thou didſt highly prize God, and his favours, thou wouldſt immediately forſake all other things, and cleave to him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things premiſed, now let us conſider why we ought to take the preſent <hi>Now,</hi> not to put off, no not a day, an hour, not this moment; and there was never <note place="margin">Why men ſhould turn to God preſently. 1.</note> any duty had ſuch reaſons for it. As</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The vanity and uncertainty of a mans life is ſo obvious a reaſon, That it is ſtrange every one doth not reſolve, Now will I forſake my accuſtomed ſins, I will do it now.</hi> The ſhortneſſe of our daies is frequently agrravated by the Scripture, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould apply our hearts to wiſedom, we ſhould not look ſo much to this moment, as provide for eternity: Who art thou then, O mortal man that doth yet put off thy repentance? who hath given thee ſecurity for to morrow? why doſt thou not take the Holy Ghoſts councel? <hi>To day, and while it is called to day, hear his voice,</hi> Pſalm 95. 7. Oh duſt and aſhes, Why art thou not afraid of being blown a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with every breath of Gods diſpleaſure? In wordly matters you are careful to make every thing ſure; you know not what will fall out, it is good to be certain; and in heavenly things, there you content your ſelves with any probabilities. The Pſalmiſt gives a convincing Epithet, <hi>Pſal. 4. O ye mortal men, how long will you love vanity.</hi> Let us then beſeech thee who art entangled in thy luſts by that body of death thou beareſt about with thee, by the conſideration of that ſentence of death paſt upon every one, the execution whereof may be this night, ſo that thou never maiſt hear this Exhortation more, by the conſideration of the grave into which thou art falling, that thou wouldſt no longer put off, but turn from thy ſins. Oh ſay, contrary to thoſe Epicures, Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we ſhall dye: Let us pray, and return unto the Lord, for to morrow we ſhall dye.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Turn now, becauſe the day of Grace and ſalvation offered unto thee, is as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain in continuance as thy life.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Behold, now is the time acceptable,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>now is the day of Salvation,</hi> 2. Cor. 6. 2. therefore receive not the grace of God in vain: and our Saviour, <hi>Work while ye have day, for the night is coming, and no man can then work,</hi> John 9. 4. If a black night for Ordinances and the Miniſtry ſhould be coming upon you, the ſun and the ſtars be turned into bloud: Oh then, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wilt thou run? and what wilt thou do? gather the Manna therefore while it falls; come in while the door of Grace ſtands open: take heed of being like <hi>Eſau,</hi> coming too late for a bleſſing, like <hi>Saul,</hi> that cannot have God anſwer him any way, by <hi>Urim, or Thummim,</hi> or any other manner: The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> might
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:30767:251"/>
well ſay, <hi>Return ye now;</hi> for ſhortly captivity, or the ſword will deprive you of all means of grace: How diligent is the husbandman to take the ſeaſon for ſowing, the tradeſman his ſeaſon for buying and ſelling! but for our ſouls we are not wiſe: We ſay not, Oh my ſoul, now if ever let this ſermon pierce thee, now if ever let this exhortation prevail with thee. Oh unwiſe men, go and learn of the bruitiſh Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they are ſo wiſe as to lay up their ſtore in ſummer againſt winter: and thus it ought to be with thee; if there may come a ſad time of famine for the Ordinances, and the means of Grace, do thou as <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who laid up proviſion for that time of ſcarcitie. Now while God calls, do thou ſay, here, Lord, I am.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Therefore turn now from your evill waies, becauſe the longer you put off, the more you hinder your peace and happineſſe.</hi> All the time ſpent in ſin is loſt time, it muſt be all redeemed again as the Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>Thou art an hinderer of thy peace and comfort all the while thou art labouring in the way of ſin,</hi> thou art with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal feeding on husks, when thou mighſt have a fatted calf; thou art eating onions when Manna may be gathered: What are the pleaſures of ſin, to the enjoyment of God, the peace of a good Conſcience, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt? How wilt thou try out when once ſet at liberty from this priſon, Now I begin to live, Now I begin to have happineſſe, now I begin to have pleaſure, but never till now? Thou wilt finde a damage, and a loſſe which cannot be repaired, but by that happineſſe in Jeſus Chriſt: So then bethink thy ſelf, What a loſer am I, exchanging dirt for gold? It is my own advantage and happineſſe, if I betake my ſelf to God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly <hi>Therefore turn to God, becauſe the longer thou putſt off, the greater diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty it will be to leave thy ſins.</hi> At laſt Converſion will be every day more remote then at firſt; for the difficulty will ariſe ſeveral waies, here will more then a three-fold cord be to be broken.</p>
                  <p>For 1. It will be more hard, becauſe ſin is every day hardening of a mans heart <note place="margin">1.</note> more: Now all hardneſſe of heart makes turning to God more difficult: wax is ſooner melted then cold Iron: Therefore ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>To day if you will hear, harden not your hearts,</hi> Pſal. 95. implying that every delay doth freez the ſoul, and make it more benummed: if thou art not fit to day, thou wilt be leſſe fit then to morrow: and hence it is why men rooted in ſin, and inveterate in old cuſtomary iniquities, do ſeldom change their black ſkins: the beginnings of a wound are to be healed; if you let it rankle and canker, then that groweth incurable at laſt. Oh then take up betimes; while there are any relentings, any meltings, go preſently to God: If thou getteſt cold after this heat, then thy diſeaſe will be more mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Therefore it is more difficult if thou delay, becauſe to thy naturall hardneſſe <note place="margin">2.</note> thou wilt add <hi>adventitious, and acquiſite,</hi> Every man naturally hath a ſtone upon his heart, and grace muſt remove that in converſion; but when thou haſt refuſed often to come at Gods call, then there is a ſecond, and a third, yea many ſtones laid upon thee while thou art buried in the grave of thy ſins; Oh then, wo be unto thee who doſt make thy condition worſe at laſt, then at firſt. Who knoweth if thou hadſt regarded the firſt impreſſions, and motions of Gods ſpirit, but that thy condition had been more hopeful? Oh take heed of proving bankrupt in the way of ſin; then the more thou ſpendeſt, the likelier to be caſt into that dungeon out of which there can be no redemption. Take heed then of adding hardneſſe to that which is inbred in thee: Thou haſt enough to preſſe thee into the loweſt ſea; thou needeſt not have more milſtones hung about thy neck.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It is therefore more difficult, becauſe the judgement of God is more terrible to ſuch in a ſpiritual manner. The Lord hath ſpirituall judgements, as well as <note place="margin">3.</note> temporall; and although we grone and complain more under bodily miſeries, yet theſe ſpiritual have the greateſt danger; and of all ſpiritual ones, this of hardneſſe of heart is the moſt grievous, as by the Prophet appeareth, <hi>Eſai. 6. Go and make their hearts fat, their eyes blinde.</hi> Oh then fear the longer thou putſt off, leſt God will
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:30767:252"/>
ſmite thee with more ſtupidity, more ſenſleſneſſe, and ſo at laſt thou f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll into an hopeleſſe condition, that all means uſed for recovery, do make thy ſickneſſe more deſperate.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Therefore it is more difficult if thou delayeſt, becauſe the divel hath thereby <note place="margin">IV.</note> got the ſtronger poſſeſſion on thee; for every man hath either God and his ſpirit dwelling in him, whereby he becomes a lively Temple, and his houſe, and ſo all things are according to his government, or elſe the Divel he hath a full poſſeſſion of him; but now his hold in thee is ſtronger and ſtonger, as thou delayſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it will be the more hard to caſt him out, when he hath had ſo many years poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. The divels that poſſeſſed the man from the womb up, could not be caſt out but by ſome extraordinary way. The divel was in <hi>Judas</hi> his heart long before, yet ſaith the Scripture, <hi>The Divel entered into his heart,</hi> John 13. 27. How is that? was he not before there? Yes, but now more then ever; he had ſinned more, and reſiſted the grace of Chriſt more, and therefore God gave him up to the greater power of the Divel: And thus it will be with thee; the more thou putſt off, the more thou delayeſt, the greater Tyranny and raign will Satan have over thee.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Therefore turn now to God, becauſe the ſooner thou goeſt to him, the more ſervice and honour thou wilt bring to him.</hi> Suppoſe a man be called at the twelfth <note place="margin">5.</note> hour, yet how little can he do for God before night? Alas thou haſt lived a long while in the ſervice of ſin and ſatan, and thou needeſt even <hi>Methuſalems</hi> age to do God ſervice, for all the diſlervice and diſhonour thou haſt done him. <hi>Paul</hi> becauſe he had been very active for the Divel, and ſo laboured more then many of his equals in pulling down the Church; therefore when once converted, ſee how he rejoyceth as a gyant to run his race, and he laboureth afterward more then all to build the Church. Oh then think the greateſt honour thou art capable of, is to do the Lords work: Angels rejoyce in this; and all the while thou art in the courſe of ſin, then thou art doing the Divels ſervice: Although now there be no greater delight to thee, then fulfilling the luſts of the fleſh, yet when thou art once turned to God, thou wilt labour abundantly in the work of God, and it will be an heavy trouble to thee that thou haſt been an enemy ſo long to God, and promoted the work of his adverſary. Therefore get betime into the vine-yard of the Lord, and ſo thou wilt have time to do him the more ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>The ſooner thou turneſt to God, thou wilt prevent the more ſin, and ſo the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>more ſhame and trouble of heart.</hi> Thoſe that have gone far in the waies of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they have the greater falls, and ſo their broken bones put them into the more pains e're they can be healed. Oh what a deal of peace would <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> and <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Magdalen</hi> have enjoyed, if they had been converted in their younger years! So if <hi>Paul</hi> had been betimes drawen home unto God, he had not had all that trouble and grief of ſpirit for perſecuting the Church of God. Thoſe that are aged women, they ſay, have the ſorer and more dangerous travails, if they had never any Children before: and thus they have the more difficult converſions, the greater anguiſh and pain of Conſcience, who have lived long in ſin, and committed great ones. Hence is that, <hi>Remember thy Creator in the daies of thy youth:</hi> and it is good to bear the yoke in the youth; ſo it is here, it is good to feel the bitterneſſe of ſin betimes; it is good in our younger years to feel how ſad a thing it is to diſpleaſe God; this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage hath early converſion. So then, let young ones hearken to ſermons, let them attend to what the Miniſters of God exhort; for converſion doth not onely belong to the old, but to the young; yea commonly converſion is ſooner wrought upon the younger ſort of people, for they have not reſiſted the grace of God ſo much, they have not provoked God to give them up to their own hearts luſts and deſires, as many aged perſons have.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, Suppoſe thy converſion and turning to God for the future, were not onely poſſible, but ſure; if it were infallibly revealed to thee, that God would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <note place="margin">7.</note> thy death make himſelf known in a gracious manner to thee, yet how unfit is old age, or a diſeaſed ſick body to turn to God? When thou haſt given the Divel
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:30767:252"/>
all thy ſervice, and power, and ſtrength, then to give a Carkaſſe to God it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly; like thoſe Heathens that keep the honey to themſelves, and offer the wax to their Gods: ſay then to thy ſelf, as the Prophet in another caſe concerning thoſe that offered blinde, and ſame Sacrifices to God: Offer it now to thy rulers, and governours, ſee if they will accept of it: And thus it is here, thy lame, diſeaſed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm ſervice, How fit is it for God, when it is not fit for any man? The command is, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy ſoul, with all thy minde, and with all thy ſtrength:</hi> if this be required of thee, then it is moſt unworthy and diſhonourable dealing, to put off God to thy feeble age.</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, <hi>Conſider the nature of ſin, what it is, and thou muſt needs ſay, There is no way, but preſently to go out of it.</hi> It is the poyſon of the ſoul, and that is not to be <note place="margin">8.</note> kept long in the body: It is the bloody wounding of it, and thou muſt not let it lye long in this bleeding: it is the meer mercy of God that ſin doth not give a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſtab and blow to thee, to undo thee to all eternity. Why then wilt thou ſtay for an hour, for a moment in this eſtate? Who would abide long in a place, where fire is ready to burn and conſume all before it? Yet this is thy condition; it was <hi>Lots</hi> great ſtupiditie, that when fire and brimſtone was ready to rain from heaven upon him, he would not go out till the Angel came and pulled him out, <hi>The Lord being mercifull to him,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>Geneſ,</hi> 19. 16. And thus it is here, our ſottiſhneſs, and ſtupidity is ſo great, that although heaven above be againſt us, and hell beneath ready to devour us, yet we think not of converſion to Him.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, <hi>If ſo be thou wouldſt ever turn to God at all, then why not now?</hi> Do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and delude thy own ſoul; if ever thou wilt part from thy luſts, begin preſently, <note place="margin">9.</note> for what can be more neceſſary? Commonly this is our method, that we will do the neceſſary things in the firſt place; we wil firſt provide for our lives, before we do for ornaments; Nature teacheth us to do that which hath the greateſt neceſſity: now then what is more neceſſary then to turn to God? if this be not done, thy ſins are upon thee, thy luſts will overwhelm thee, thy damnation is ſure and unavoidable. Turn now unto God, becauſe it is moſt neceſſary: one thing is needful: neither ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, honour, or any advantages are like to this. Beſides, if ever thou wilt turn to God, do it now, for there can be no reaſon hereafter, which will not be much more now. Is ſin of a terrible damning nature, then it is ſo now? Doth Gods anger be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to ſin, ſo it doth now? Is God alſo to be loved, and choſen before all things? then now as well as at any time hereafter. Thy comforts will be greater, thy ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour more, thy ſervice to God more; therefore return now unto God.</p>
                  <p>Uſe of Exhortation, to be perſwaded to this duty, <hi>Return now,</hi> ſet immediately upon the work, Why ſhould Gods work be done laſt of all? Oh think rather I will turn unto God, and that preſently, becauſe I may dye before I think of it. If I dye before I have ſetled ſuch and ſuch worldly buſineſſes, there is nothing but a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral loſſe; but if I dye before I have ſetled the peace of my ſoul, then I am eternally undone. Oh how many have been ſurprized by Gods ſtroke, before ever they thought of it: then they cry out, <hi>Lord, spare me one year longer, Lord, give me space once more; I am not ready to dye, I have not quitted my ſins; Oh if I dye now, I ſhall dye and be damned in them.</hi> Come then and take the good counſel of the Prophet, <hi>Do it now;</hi> are your hearts yielding and conſenting? you will have the comfort of ſincerity, if you turn to God while in your health and ſtrength; whereas when fear and danger works upon thee, then ſtill thou wilt doubt of thy integrity in what thou doſt.</p>

                  <p>THeſe words (you heard) were the ſecond part of <hi>Jeremiah's</hi> Commiſſion, the matter whereof is exhortatory, and in that the duty, and the time of the duty have been conſidered. The third thing in order to be proſecuted, is the ſubject, with the appropriation of it, <hi>Every man from his evill wayes.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the common and general ſins, wherein all had defiled themſelves, there were alſo peculiar darling and beloved ſins, that every one had eſpouſed particularly to themſelves: If therefore they would declare their ſincere, and unfeigned Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion unto God, they were to throw away theſe <hi>Dalilah's</hi> to ſacrifice theſe <hi>Iſaacs,</hi> their onely ſins, which they loved ſo much. A man may leave many ſins without any trouble, ſo as it be not that to which he is dearly ingaged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That true Converſion will put a man upon the forſaking his dear and beloved ſin:</hi> He will not as <hi>Lot,</hi> deſire to have a little one ſpared: So, Lord, I will pray, hear, <note place="margin">Obſ.</note> turn unto thee; onely in this ſpare me. Some ſay, that <hi>Naaman</hi> the <hi>Syrian</hi> was not truely converted, becauſe he ſtuck at one beloved ſin; for when he proffered his ſervice to the true God, promiſing to take him for the only Lord, he addeth, <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don thy Servant in one thing, that when I goe down into the houſe of Rimmon, and my Maſter lean on me, I alſo then bow down,</hi> 2 King. 5. 18. They that make him not a true Convert, ſay, here was hypocriſie. This Office was a place of honour and profit, and ſo though he would acknowledge the true God in many things; yet this his evill way he would not leave; I will not determine that point of his true Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but certainly this is a very frequent miſcarriage in theſe dayes; Many hear the Word gladly, receive it with ſome joy, and do many things willingly; but then they are held in one ſtring, there is one dead Fly, and that marreth the Box of oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo that it paſſeth a Diminitive <hi>but</hi> on a man, and all his Religion. As in that <hi>Naaman</hi> we inſtanced in, it is ſaid he was a great man, and of great authority in the land, but he was a Leper, and that marred all: ſo it is here, he prayeth, he heareth, he conformeth to many godly things; but there is ſuch a finne, ſuch a luſt, and that undoeth all; and as every man may have his particular ſin; ſo its obſerved, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have their proper ſins. The <hi>Jewes</hi> in former times were above all ſins proue
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:30767:253"/>
to Idolatrie; therefore its thought God did exerciſe them in ſuch a bodily way of worſhip; and ſo many external and glorious Ceremonies were commanded them; that if poſſible, they might not deſire Idolatrous worſhip. The <hi>Corinthians,</hi> their ſin was uncleanneſſe and wantonneſſe, therefore the Apoſtle doth ſo much preſſe Arguments againſt that. The <hi>Cretians</hi> are branded to be alwayes Lyars; and the Apoſtle confirmeth this teſtimony. Thus Nations have their proper ſins, as well as particular perſons, yea particular Towns and Villages, by one reaſon or other, are obſerved to be more prone to ſome kind of ſin then others: But I ſhall limit my ſelf to particular mens darling corruptions, which is the root to be plucked up, the Fountain to be dryed up; and every Chriſtian ſhould be ſo far a ſpirituall Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to himſelf, as to be able to know, what is that particular ſin to which he is moſt inclined; for at that breach hell and damnation will enter.</p>
                  <p>But to make this point naked and open, conſider, <hi>That Originall ſin, though it</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved and dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſins. I.</note> 
                     <hi>be the ſeed of all kind of wickedneſſe, and there cannot be an inſtance given of any horrid crime in the world, but this would carry a man unto it, yet this poiſon in every man vents it ſelf in one way, rather than another:</hi> Even as in every mans body there is a ſeed and principle of death; yet in ſome there is a proneneſſe to one kind of diſeaſe more than to another; and this may be called that mans proper ſin, his evill way. As Philoſophy tels us, Though all the individuals of one kind agree in one common ſpecifical nature, yet every one hath a particular difference, whereby it is diſtinguiſhed from another, which they call <hi>Hecciety;</hi> ſo its here, though there be many ſins acted in common by all, yet ſeveral men have their particular corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are like the Prince of Devils, that commands all their other ſins. Its true, there is no ſin committed by any man, but thou haſt cauſe to bleſſe God, that thou art not as deſperately intangled in it, as others. Therefore what the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks of the worſt of wicked men, and higheſt enemies to the Church of God, the Apoſtle <hi>Romans</hi> 3. applyeth to everie man. Yet evetie man hath his inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to one kind of ſinne rather than another: and this difference of darling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beloved ſinnes may ariſe from two grounds, the one internal, the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The internall cauſe of a beloved ſin is the complexion and bodily conſtitution of a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The reaſon of the difference of darling ſins in men. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>man:</hi> For as one mans body inclines to cholerick diſeaſes, another to melancholick; ſo the very natural conſtitution, while a man is under the power of ſinne, hurrieth one way rather than another: Not that this excuſeth a man, to ſay, its his inclination to do thus and thus, he cannot help it, for ſanctifying grace will work in a man, a contrarie inclination, put another predominant principle within him; and beſides this doth not extenuate, but aggravate his ſin; for the more it is rooted, and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to him, the more difficult will his recoverie be; ſo then a mans peculiar ſin, that he is moſt addicted unto, may ariſe from his bodily conſtitu<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ion, that may be a more prepared inſtrument for ſome vice rather than another. <hi>Or our darling ſinne</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>may ariſe from ſome externall cauſes,</hi> and they may be theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Cuſtome and uſe in ſome kind of ſinne.</hi> Frequent cuſtome doth at laſt breed an habituated delight, and becomes a ſecond nature; ſo that men who have been in long Captivity and ſervice to luſts, they willingly have their eares boared, and are never willing to leave that Service. We ſee dayly ſad experience of this truth. Men who through long continuance in ſinne, have now turned it into their nature, They ſay of that ſin, as Chriſt of grace, One thing is needfull; <hi>They add Drunkenneſſe to Thirſt,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> calls it, <hi>Deuteronomie</hi> 29. 19. That is, after they have committed ſinne, they are vehement and fervent for it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>A darling Sin may ariſe from the condition, or relation we are in.</hi> There may be ſome temptations ſutable to the inward luſts of an heart, that we cannot leave ſuch ſins, unleſſe we quite forſake ſuch a condition, or calling. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> his beloved ſin was Covetouſneſſe; and his condition he was in, carrying
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:30767:254"/>
the Bag, that was a continual blaſt to blow up the fire of luſts; ſo if ambitious men get to the pinacle of honour; if covetous men to places of profit and gain, here the Serpent in their breaſts gets the warm beams of the Sun, there is a daily incentive to add many Cubits to the ſtature of their luſts; and its a very ill and malignant conſtellation, when a mans outward condition, and his peculiar ſinne meet together, he had great need to pray to be delivered from the mouth of ſuch Lions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>In the next place, that may be called a mans particular way of ſinning, which yet we cannot call his beloved ſin.</hi> For it may be a great grief and torment <note place="margin">II.</note> to him, it may be a Tyrant uſurping power over him, not the delight of his ſoul. Some ſay <hi>David</hi> was very prone to the ſin of lying; its plain, that being in many ſtreights by <hi>Saul,</hi> he uſed many unlawfull ſhifts: Now this was an heavy burden to him, <hi>Deliver me from the way of lying,</hi> Pſalme 119. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>9. He doth earneſtly pray againſt this Sinne: And ſo in another place, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 31. 10. He ſpeaks of being kept from mine iniquity: ſo the godly may be more prone to fall into one ſin then another; ſome into inordinate paſſion, ſome to cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly fear, ſome to diffidence in the promiſes; yet theſe are not their beloved ſinnes, but their hated enemies, they mourn and complain with <hi>Paul,</hi> That this Law of ſinne within them leadeth them Captives; They cry out, and ſay, Their ſouls ſuffer violence within them: No ſinne, but Chriſt, is the beloved of their ſouls; he is the chiefeſt of ten thouſands; yet ſome corruption or other beateth them often down; they are more overtaken in ſuch a corruption then in any; Therefore they ſay, This is my iniquity, this is the <hi>Saul</hi> that is always purſuing of me. Its neceſſary the godly ſhould underſtand this difference between a ſinne beloved, and a ſin violently tyrannizing over them: for this is moſt certain, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever giveth up himſelf willingly to one kind of ſin, he is yet in the ſtate of nature and wrath, he is not turned unto God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>As many of Gods people have found their hearts weakeſt to reſiſt ſome kinde of ſins: ſo the godly have for the moſt part ſome grace or other wherein they</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">III.</note> 
                     <hi>doe moſt excell.</hi> They have their way of grace, wherein they are moſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable: Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> is marked for his meekneſſe, <hi>David</hi> for ſincerity and a faithfull heart, <hi>Paul</hi> for zealous labour in promoting the Goſpel. Hence the godly are exhorted to think better of one another than their own ſelves; becauſe there is no grace, but one man may exceed another in: This ſhould teach the head or eye not to deſpiſe the foot; for even that member hath ſome peculiar ſerviceableneſſe which the other hath not.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, conſider the Signs or Diſcoveries of a beloved ſin, and they will appear thus: <note place="margin">IV.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That which ſwallowes and devoureth all thy other ſins.</hi> All other ſinnes are but ſtreams emptying themſelves into that Fountain, and Ocean; this is the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <note place="margin">1.</note> ſinne. The Phariſees peculiar ſinne was vain-glory, becauſe all things were referred to that: For ſeeing ſuch a ſinne is in the room of God to them, whole belly is their God, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 19. Therefore they refer all to that. The Adulterer, if he be greedy toget gain, its but to conſume upon his luſts; for that is the Idol of his heart; ſo Covetouſneſſe in an earthly man is called Idolatry; becauſe all the ſins he commits, all the fraud and wrong he doth, its to ſatisfie this: As in a mans body, where there is one great wound, all the humours will run thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>A beloved ſin is that, wherein a man cannot endure to be reproved and rebuked ſharply.</hi> They can with great delight, hear you preach againſt ſuch <note place="margin">2.</note> and ſuch ſinnes; but then come to that wherein they are moſt intangled, then all their malice and venome works, ſo that there is no ſuch diſcovery of a darling ſinne, as a mans impatience, and fretting againſt thoſe who faithfully rebuke. When <hi>Herodias</hi> deſireth <hi>Johns</hi> head in a Platter, it was becauſe his Tongue
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:30767:254"/>
had reproved her beloved ſin. Thus becauſe the Phariſees were reproved by Chriſt for their beloved ſins, hypocriſie, and Self-righteouſneſſe, they were moved with envy and hatred againſt him. Try then thy ſelf, canſt thou endure the ſharp Raſor ſhould come upon the ſoreſt part? Is there nothing that is in the Word cutting like a two-edged ſword, but thou art willing it ſhould enter into thy very heart? This is very comfortable.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>That is a mans beloved ſinne, on which his minde, his heart, and all his</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>labour is ſpent.</hi> The Voluptuous man is deſcribed to be one that maketh proviſion for the fleſh. The Adulterer is brought in by <hi>Solomon</hi> diligently obſerving the time for his Luſts. The malicious Enemy to Godlineſſe is ſaid by <hi>David</hi> to go up and down the ſtreet like a Dog waiting for an opportunity, and cannot ſleep till he hath accompliſhed miſchief. As <hi>Joſeph</hi> was known to be <hi>Jacobs</hi> Darling, becauſe he beſtowed a more excellent coat upon him than the reſt, and ſo the elder Sonne was to have a double Portion, as moſt beloved; So that ſinne which hath a double Portion above others, that which hath more of thy Cares, thy Thoughts, thy heart; that is thy Darling ſinne: Oh kill that, cruſh that in the Egge, before it come to be a Cockatrice. Men ſhould commune with their own hearts, and ſtudy themſelves more than they do in this matter.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>That is thy darling ſinne, which thou wouldſt have ſpared above all.</hi> Thou wouldſt never ſtand delaying, but turn immediately to God, but for that. <note place="margin">4.</note> That which thou hideſt in time of danger, as <hi>Iehojadah</hi> did young <hi>Ioas,</hi> hoping in time to make him King. This is the <hi>Goliah</hi> of all the <hi>Philiſtims:</hi> Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when the Grace of God comes cloſe to a mans heart, begins to wreſtle and combate with ſinne; then there is no ſuch ſturdy and potent enemy as that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ſin. All the difficulty is in throwing down that mountain. When there was a man very forward, and not very far from the Kingdom of Chriſt, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our to trie his ſincerity, preſently puts him upon the leaving his indeared ſin, and then ſaith the Text, <hi>He went away exceeding ſorrowful.</hi> This was the cup of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie-water that did preſently make his thigh to rot. What then is the ſinne that hinders thee alway? That is the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <p>Fiftly, <hi>The darling ſinne may be found out by the eaſineſſe to be overcome by it. Sampſon</hi> is eaſily perſwaded by <hi>Dalilah,</hi> when none elſe in the World could <note place="margin">5.</note> ſteal away his heart. The Apoſtle bids us lay aſide the ſin that doth ſo eaſily beſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 1. Its the general Rule of the Scripture, Of what a man is overcome, that he is in bondage unto: and if the man be eaſily without any reſiſtance over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, then its an argument he is the more in bondage. Conſider then what that ſinne is, which thou canſt hardly refuſe, what that is which finds the door always open, and there know all thy Calamity ariſeth by that, Its an heavy ſlavery (if the ſoul could be ſenſible) to be at the command of any ſinne; when it faith, Go, thou goeſt; and when Come, thou comeſt: Thou canſt deny nothing to it, as <hi>Herod</hi> could not to <hi>Herodias;</hi> Ask not half, but the whole Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and thou will part with it to enjoy thy luſts.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have heard how this particular ſin of a man, which is his own indeared corruption may be found out.</p>
                  <p>Now lets conſider, Why Converſion to God doth in a ſpeciall manner make <note place="margin">Why Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion makes a man leave his darling ſins.</note> a man leave this: The work of Grace doth in a peculiar manner take off this yoke <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

That was the <hi>premum mobile</hi> which carried all the reſt with it; ſo that as it was given in command to the Souldiers, that they ſhould not fight with little, or great, but with the King of Iſrael: ſo grace in the heart of a man doth not ſo much aſſault leſſe ſinnes as this great one. Come, ſaith grace, let us deſtroy this, and all is ours, This is the ſtrong man that muſt be bound ere the houſe can be taken: This is the Dim that muſt firſt be deſtroyed. No wonder then, that a man intangled in any cloſe beloved ſin, can promiſe himſelf any true comfort or hope, for he is under the ſtrong power of ſin and Satan, as long as this is upon him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Therefore a man muſt forſake this beloved ſinne, becauſe in true conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion unto God, we are to leave ſinne upon ſuch ſpirituall and Scripture grounds</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>which are true in every ſinne, as well as in any.</hi> The grounds of turning from ſinne are, becauſe its contrarie to an holy God, it oppoſeth an heavenly and pure Law, it grieveth Gods Spirit, its the noiſome filthineſſe and dung of the ſoul: Why then if this be thy ground, then all this is true of thy beloved ſin as much as any; for that is againſt Gods holy will, that is oppoſite to a ſpirituall Law that is contrary to purity and the beauty of the ſoul. Its an hypocritical Converſion, when men leave ſome ſins, and not others; they can part with ſome kind of cocorruptions; but then there are others of which they ſay, as was of <hi>Goliah's</hi> ſword, None like that. Now all this is but deceit and frowardneſſe of heart, this is but halting before God; for if thy beloved luſt be ſinne, if an enemy to God, if an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie to his glorie, how canſt thou lodge it in thy ſoul? Oh that people would attend more to the true ſpiritual and acceptable ground of leaving a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſinne, for that would ſweep all away, it would not leave an Hoof in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Therefore in Converſion, a man will be ſure to leave his peculiar ſin, becauſe all repentance and humiliation is a kinde of revenge, and ſpirituall judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>and condemning of our ſelves.</hi> If we would judge our ſelves we ſhould not be judged of the Lord; ſo the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that had been too conniving at the inceſtuous perſon, not indeavouring to purge out the old Leaven as they ſhould: when they began to turn from this ſin, then ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>What fear? yea what zeal, what indignation and revenge? 2 Corinth. 7. 11. In all things ye have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to clear your ſelves in this matter.</hi> Thus it is with a godly man; of all ſinnes, that which was his greateſt delight, his greateſt practice, now his greateſt zeal and indignation is againſt: Was uncleanneſſe his beloved ſinne? Now he doth eſpecially abound in purity; that ſo all the world, yea and God alſo may ſee him clear. Was pride his darling ſinne? then of all graces he is moſt cloathed with Humilitie. <hi>Pauls</hi> great ſinne was perſecuting and deſtroying the Church of God once: but when converted, who had ſuch Fatherlie bowels? who had the Church in his heart ſo much as he? As <hi>Cran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap>er,</hi> that had ſubſcribed with his right hand to that which was againſt his Conſcience, afterwards with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge put that firſt into the Flames; So doth the true Convert; Of all ſins I will be revenged moſt of that, by which I moſt diſhonoured God. Thus <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> takes that hair of hers which had been uſed to allure others, and waſhes Chriſts Feet with it. And thoſe eyes that had been wanton Snares, doe now ſtand beblubbered with Water. Thus the godly man will be avenged upon his ſpiritual luſts.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Converſion to God is the bringing of a man to true and ſolid Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note>
                     <pb n="463" facs="tcp:30767:255"/>
Now that will preſently adviſe him to take heed of that ſin which will moſt eaſily ſeduce him: He will take heed of that fire which hath ſo grievouſly ſcorched him; He will remember the deadly wounds and bloudy ſtroaks ſuch ſinnes have given his Conſcience; and therefore he is afraid, and trembleth at the verie approach of ſuch ſinnes. <hi>David</hi> when he had been throughly humbled for his Murder of <hi>Uriah,</hi> afterwards refuſed to drink the Water that men jeoparded their lives for: This is the bloud of man, he cryeth out: So will the true Convert be afraid to come near the borders, near the temptations of his old former ſins.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Therefore doth Converſion make a man leave his darling ſinnes, becauſe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>it puts a man upon ſhewing the greateſt love he can to God, who hath ſhewed ſo much to him.</hi> Now wherein can he ſhew more ſervice and love to God, than by kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his <hi>Abſolom,</hi> by offering his <hi>Iſaac? Now,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>I know thou loveſt me, becauſe thou haſt not ſpared thy onely beloved Sonne.</hi> So God, Now I know thou art truely converted to me, for thou doſt not ſpare thy dear luſts, thou doſt not hide thy beloved ſinnes any more: Love to God will put a man upon this; and no wonder, for it puts a man to loſe his Wife, Children, yea his dear life for Chriſts ſake: is it then any wonder, if it parts a man and his beloved ſinnes?</p>
                  <p>Uſe of <hi>Inſtruction,</hi> That all they are ſtill in their Hypocriſie, and lye under <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> Gods wrath, who retain any beloved ſinne. What though thou doeſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, yet if thou wilt not part with thy <hi>Herodias,</hi> thou art in Gall and Wormwood. And this is the rather to be obſerved, becauſe a man may goe for in the profeſſion of Religion, yet have ſome ſecret beloved finne that he hugs in his Boſome all the while. Oh throw that Toad out of thy heart; Chriſt cannot, will not dwell in thy heart, till that enemy of his be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodged. Oh let a <hi>Iudas</hi> be a Pillar of Salt to ſeaſon you: Did not he pray, hear, work Miracles in Chriſts Name, and yet lived in a ſecret belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſinne? God will unmask ſuch Hypocriſie, and make thy ſinne finde thee out.</p>

                  <p>That which we are to move from, yea run and fly from, is the impiety and tranſgreſſion of our lives. Every one that lieth in any ſin, muſt be turned up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide down, as it were; his love muſt be where his hatred was; his grief where his delight was; his back, where his face was; and his face and affections upon that, on which his back and all contempt and ſcorn was. To turn and change from a mans former ſins, is no diſgrace, but a neceſſary duty, and a great dignity: Thus Converſion is a motion from ſin, not like the turning of a door upon the ſame hinge, never moved out of his place. Wonder not that I am long on this ſubject; for I am not yet near the bottom of this excellent Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of matter, and we ſhall draw up new and freſh water, not troubling you with the ſame matter that hath already been handled. For the diſcovery of this point; Conſider</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Who they are that are in ſin, or live in ſin, and therefore need converſion:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Every man. For</note> For many a man is eternally undone, becauſe he doth not ſee a neceſſity of his turning to God; he either takes for granted, that he is already converted, or <note place="margin">1. All by nature are in a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſtate of ſin.</note> he thinks converſion is onely for Pagans or Hereticks, to the true Chriſtian faith, or ſome notorious groſs ſinners, whoſe ſins are of a crimſon colour. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to undeceive and convince you herein, know and conſider, what it is to be in ſin, or who may be ſaid to be in ſin, and every ſuch perſon needs conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, <hi>Every one by nature is in the damnable ſtate of ſin, although he
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:30767:256"/>
never committed any actual impiety:</hi> Thus ſin was unknown to Heathens, and denyed by ſome Heretiques; but the Scripture doth plainly aſſert it, concluding us <hi>To be children of wrath by nature</hi> Epheſ. 2. he doth not ſay, by actions, by cuſtom, by practice, but <hi>by nature:</hi> This is the firſt ſtone, and the deep foundation that muſt be laid: This is called native, original, natural, and hereditary ſin. Till a man be inwardly and powerfully convinced of this, he cannot ever think of turning unto God; ſo that converſion is requiſite to every one that hath this birth-ſin. We come naturally with our back to heaven, and face to hell; now here muſt be a converſion unto God: Begin here, and ſtudy here, How were it poſſible that men ſhould ſit and hear ſo much of turning to God, and never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to move towards him, but becauſe they feel not this natural averſeneſs in their whole man from God, and what is holy? Let no man, free from groſs ſins, and walking in an orderly civil way, think this duty of converſion doth not belong to him; for if thou hadſt no more ſin in thee then the childe new born, thou wert yet to turn unto God, as being in a dangerous path of death and deſtruction; yea, this converſion and turning from this innate corruption, is far more difficult, then from any actual impieties, for this is more cloſely bred in thee, and ſetled in thy bowels: The Scripture calls this thy body, thy fleſh, thy members, as if thou wert turned into this ſin: This is the fountain, this is the root, this walketh with thee, riſeth with thee, dwells in thee, as in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per poſſeſſion: ſo that in your turning from ſin, be ſure you go as deep as to this native filthineſs: Its not to turn thy coat, or thy skin, but thy very heart and inwards, when you are to turn unto God: We ſhall ſhew in time, of many turnings to God, but they laid no good foundation, they laid not the ax to the root of the tree; they cut off <hi>Sampſons</hi> hair, but plucked it not up by the root, and ſo the ſtrength of corruption prevailed over them again; ſo that this turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſin, is to turn from thy own ſelf, to leave thy own ſelf, and joyn with God, to be one with him: As iron put into the fire a long while, loſeth its coldneſs, and its black colour, and looks like fire. Its a true and good ſaying of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe, Homo recedens malè a Deo, cecidit in ſeipſum,</hi> Man falling from God, fell into his own ſelf: So that he is as a beaſt tyed up in a cloſe dungeon; his thoughts, his affections, his deſigns are onely for himſelf, original corruption hath brought this perverſe diſtemper on a man; look then that thou break this Dragons head: Thou wilt finde thy ſelf within (how glorious ſoever in thy externals) like <hi>Ezekiels</hi> wall, whereon were pourtrayed the forms of all creeping and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable things; or like <hi>Peters</hi> ſheet, that had all the kindes of unclean beaſts within, Thus thy heart hath all manner of vile and foul luſts cleaving unto thee; and therefore though thou wert as innocent from actual ſins, as once in thy cradle, yet thou art to turn to God, and to forſake that preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That man is ſtill in ſin, and ſo needs converſion unto God, <hi>who</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. Having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward delights and luſts after ſin.</note> 
                     <hi>hath daily inward delights and luſts after ſin, though it may be, fear, and ſhame, and outward puniſhment keep them from acting the evil they would do.</hi> It was a received opinion among the Phariſees, and many Heathens, that the meer will and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſin, did not deſerve puniſhment, no not from God: From man indeed it cannot: but to think thoughts, deſires, and inward purpoſes of ſin, are free alſo with God, is to deny the Law to be a ſpiritual law, forbiddin, all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward motions and affections of ſin; it is to deny God to be a father of ſpirits, who beholdeth and tryeth the inward man, and doth moſt abhor ſpirit-filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Hence <hi>Peter, 2 Pet. 1. Beſeecheth as ſtrangers to abſtain from thoſe luſts that war againſt the ſoul:</hi> Grant therefore, that ſtill thy life be unſpotted from all the groſs ſins of the world, yet as long as unruly luſts prevail in thy heart, as long as inward ſecret motions of ſin prevail over thee, thou art far off from God, and therefore needeſt turning to him: Oh how well were it, if all thy filthy luſts within were diſcovered to thee! if thou didſt judge thy ſelf a ſerpent, which
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:30767:257"/>
though it hath a glittering, glorious skin, yet is full of poyſon and venom within.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He is ſtill in his ſins, and ſo needeth turning to God, that doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and daily live in the committing of groſs and known ſins: This is as clear <note place="margin">3. And ſome live in the conſtant and daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting of groſs and known ſins.</note> as that thou liveſt and breatheſt; and to this man properly the Text ſpeaks, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from his evil way.</hi> An evil way, is the trade, cuſtom, and ordinary practice of a man: Oh then if we behold the lives of moſt men, who is there that doth not need converſion? who doth not walk in one evil way or other? who doth not live in the practice of one known ſin or other? Then what an heavy judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is this of God, that no more are converted? that ſo few ever turn from their wicked way, but live and dye in it? How often, as the Scripture cryeth out, <hi>Return, O Shunamite, Return, Return,</hi> have the Miniſters of God cryed aloud to ſuch, Return, O return, and yet men go on deſperately in paths of rebellion againſt God! Oh why is it, that when ſo many in our Congregations need this grace of converſion, ſo few obtain it! Know, thou that liveſt in the cuſtomary commiſſion of any known groſs ſin, thou art ſpeedily to get out from it, as <hi>Lot</hi> was out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> when fire and brimſtone were ready from heaven to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, They live ſtill in their ſin, and ſo need converſion to God, Who though <note place="margin">4. Or if they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>never yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of them.</note> now they do not commit their ſins they once did, <hi>yet never have truly and unfeign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lyrepanted of them:</hi> Oh its again and again to be conſidered, upon what terms men leave their ſins; Thou waſt ſuch and ſuch a prophane wretch once, but now thou art not; How comes this forbearance of time? if it be not from godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and a true apprehenſion of Gods diſpleaſure, thou art ſtill in thy ſins, though they were committed many years ago. Its one thing not to commit ſin again, and another thing to turn from ſin: The former may be done upon many grounds that are not heavenly and gracious; but the latter is onely upon pure grounds: But of this more in the counterfeit work of converſion.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee how every Auditor is not to let theſe ſermons paſs as general things, like a tale that is told, wherein they are not concerned; but to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Is not all this ſpoken to me? am not I in the number of thoſe, who yet need converſion? was it ever done upon me? when did God ever make this change upon me? Oh this undoeth you! notwithſtanding all preaching, and all your hearing, no man ſaith, What have I done? am I turned to God? you ſee every man by nature is a Blackamore, that muſt be made white: If thou haſt not outward wickedneſs to turn from, thou haſt that inbred pollution, yea, thy own ſelf to turn from. Thus you ſee who are to turn from ſin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Which is the quinteſſence of this point, Let us conſider what are the motives and grounds which are acceptable with God, when we turn from <note place="margin">II. The acceptable motives and grounds of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> ſin; for, as you heard, Men have left their ſins, they have not ſo much turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them, but even run from them. <hi>Ahab,</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites, Judas,</hi> thoſe turned from their ſins, would do ſo no more, at leaſt as their preſent condition was; yet they never truly turned from any one ſin: Therefore conſider, that every kinde of forſaking ſin, is not preſently a turning unto God. That you may underſtand this, conſider what are the right motives with a true convert to leave ſin; he will never do or live as he hath done, no, not for all the world; And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>There are inferior or leſſe principal motives, which do lawfully work upon a man, to make him turn from ſin, ſo long as they are in the ſecond place;</hi> And that is the <note place="margin">1.</note> Argument in the Text, <hi>Gods framing and bringing evil upon men for their ſins:</hi> When God complaineth that he had thus and thus ſcourged them, yet they did not return unto him; this argueth, <hi>That its lawful to turn from ſin, becauſe of the fear of puniſhment, and Gods judgements accempanying it:</hi> And commonly this is the firſt motive in place, though the laſt in dignity and worth: Let then all the threatnings, all the wrath of God denounced againſt ſin, make thee ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turn from it, for God (as the Magiſtrate) doth not bear his ſword in vain,
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:30767:257"/>
neither doth the Scripture threaten in vain; but if there be no more reaſon then this, if this be the principal and the onely, then thou loveſt ſin ſtill in thy heart; thou art kept from it, as the Dog by a clog on him, from doing his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. The godly, though they may be firſt awakened to turn from ſin by theſe thorns in their ſides, and yokes on their necks, yet they ſtay not in theſe; but they have more Noble and Divine grounds why they turn from ſin; And they are:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The offence and juſt diſpleaſure that is given God, by their iniquities:</hi> Oh <note place="margin">1.</note> this prevaileth with them, more then all external puniſhments in the world: Alas, what is ſword, or death, or hell it ſelf, to Gods frowns, to Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſures? Thus <hi>David</hi> in his converſion to God, after his grievous relapſe, is affected with this, <hi>Againſt thee, thee onely have I ſinned, and done this evil in thy ſight,</hi> Pſal. 51. It was not loſs of childe, and many other ſad chaſtiſements that followed him and his poſterity, did ſo much affect him as this; He had diſpleaſed God, and done evil in his ſight: This is a ſure and everlaſting ground, thoſe that walk by this rule, will never prove a deceitful bow.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>They turn from ſin, becauſe of the contrariety it hath to the pure, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>and holy Law of God:</hi> And this is a ſure ſign of a true convert, when a man turneth from his ſin, becauſe of the enmity and repugnancy it hath to the holy Commandment of God: This is to leave ſin, becauſe of the nature of it, and for its ſelfs ſake. Hence though God had not confirmed his Law by any threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, or made it penal in ſuch an high way of puniſhment, yet the heart of him, who thus turneth to God, could not cloſe with it, or imbrace it. The Apoſtle maketh the very nature of ſin to lie in this, that it is a tranſgreſſion of the Law: Now then when a man ſhall leave ſin, not onely becauſe it hath the curſes and the puniſhment of the Law, but becauſe its the tranſgreſſion of the Law; this is a good ſign. You may behold this excellent diſpoſition in <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7. What is that which makes him ſo ſadly bewail his captivity and thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to ſin? ſee the motive, <hi>Becauſe the Law was holy and ſpiritual, and he was carnal:</hi> The purity of the Law, and the impurity of his ſpirit, made ſuch an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and conflicts in his ſoul: Oh then conſider, what is that which ſets thy ſoul on turning from ſin, is it meerly an external puniſhment, not the loathſom and contrary nature of ſin, to Gods pure commands? this is not compleat and ſincere; it doth not argue thy turning to be from a true inward principle, but from external violence: Even as the wheel in the mil, moveth as long as the force of the waters compell it, but when they ceaſe, then the wheel ceaſeth; all ſee this motion is not natural, but violent; ſo it is here, as long as the waters of afflictions are upon thee, they ſet the wheel of thy heart moving in prayer and other duties, but when theſe are dryed up, then thou ſtandeſt immoveable in thy ſins. Oh then hunger and thirſt for this frame of a true convert, that thou mayeſt ſay, O Lord, though ſin hath ſo many inticements of pleaſure and carnal advantage on one hand; and though it hath ſo much wrath and terror on the other hand, yet neither of theſe prevail ſo much with me, as becauſe ſin is contrary to ſo exact a rule, oppoſite to ſo heavenly a principle: He that can upon good grounds ſay this, needeth not doubt of the integrity of his heart.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The true Convert leaves his ſin and turneth from it, becauſe of love to God, and thoſe graces which ſin doth thwart: Ye that love the Lord, hate evil; hate that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>which is evil, and cleave to that which is good,</hi> Rom. 12. Men may turn from ſin, and yet love it for all that; they part with it, becauſe ſin is either taken from them, or they from it: Who can ſay, but that <hi>Pharaohs</hi> diſmiſſion of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was wholly againſt his will? had it not been for the ſharp rod on his back, he would never have yileded; now all theſe things are by force and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint: But as God loves a willing giver, ſo he loveth a willing forſaker of his ſins, one that doth it with love and delight in him. When two things are fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen and congealed together, they may either be violently ſeparated by forcible

breaking the ice, or kindely by the thawings and meltings of the Sun: Thus it is here, when men and their ſins are congealed together, the Devil hath mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them together; now theſe may be ſeparated violently, by ſome forcible judgements of God, that they cannot ſin, though they would, as they have done; or elſe in a kindely, gracious manner, and that is by the love of God ſhed abroad in their hearts; for whatſoever is not done out of love to God, is not thank worthy, neither doth God accept it: But the bypocrite, when he is forced to leave his ſin, it is with him, as it was with the Devils that poſſeſſed bodies, they came out indeed when Chriſt commanded, for they could do no otherwiſe, but ſore againſt their wills, therefore they were vexed, and tore and rent the poſſeſſed party as they went out; thus they leave ſin as unwillingly: Therefore let the love of God be kindled like a fire in thy breaſt, and that will ſeparate thee from ſin.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>He turneth from ſin, becauſe of the unkindeneſs and ingratitude that is in every tranſgreſſion:</hi> All ſin hath rebellion in it, againſt God as our Soveraign, <note place="margin">4.</note> and unkindeneſs againſt him, as a merciful father, and the fouutain of all the good we have: Now he that doth truly turn from ſin, is much moved thereunto, becauſe of the unkindeneſs therein to all Gods mercies, becauſe God was ſo ill recompenſed after his love to us: Thus God aggravates <hi>Davids</hi> ſins, by enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the ſeveral mercies that were beſtowed on him, <hi>If all this had been too little I would have given thee more,</hi> ſaith God; ſo many mercies, ſo many hot coals of fire, and this makes a man eſcape from his ſins. We might alſo ſhew, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe grounds of turning from ſin, hold in every particular tranſgreſſion, therefore their converſion is univerſal; but of that hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Now let us inſtance in thoſe things that hinder this motion or turning unto God: And <note place="margin">III. The hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of it. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Want of ſpiritual life:</hi> You wonder not if the dead carcaſs lie always in the ſame place, and do not ſtir it ſelf; neither is it ſtrange to ſee men dead in ſin, and buried in the grave of it, never taking one ſtep forward to heaven.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. As in corporal motion, there are two things requiſite, the eye to <note place="margin">2.</note> direct, and the feet to walk; ſo for the ſoul to turn from ſin, there muſt be a right and pure eye, and there muſt be ſound and good feet. The eye is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, eſpecially faith, which is the pupil of the eye; that diſcovers the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger we are in, the judgements imminent over us, and this will make us riſe up and walk. When that thick <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkneſs was, the people ſate ſtill, and did not ſtir out of their places for ſeveral days together; and thus men in darkneſs of minde, that know nothing of God, Heaven, or their own damnation, they ſit ſtill and ſee none of this evil coming on them.</p>
                  <p>Again, Affections are often called the feet of the ſoul; by theſe we turn from ſin, when we are converted, love to God, grief for ſin, and hatred of it, deſire <note place="margin">3.</note> and hope of pardon, and enjoyment of Gods favor: But the natural man is like the poor Cripple, that lay thirty years by the pool of <hi>Betheſda,</hi> he cannot move himſelf to be healed: As the poor bed-ridden man, he cannot ſtir or move himſelf; ſo neither can ſuch, who lie ſin-ridden, under the power and command of all foul iniquities.</p>
                  <p>Uſe of inſtruction, how much this Text, and this point of Converſion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth moſt of our hearers; for who is not in one evil way or other? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is not onely to be preached to thoſe that are in the High-ways, Gentiles and Heathens, but to you who frequent the ſolemn aſſemblies; yet what hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er goeth home, and thinketh with himſelf, I am yet to be converted, I am yet to turn from my evil way? Do not eaſily perſwade your ſelves, that the work is done already; no, ſuch a change as this would make more noiſe in thy conſcience, it would make more alterations in thy life; thy ſoul would have been in travel and pangs ere this manchilde had been brought forth: How art thou turned from that, which thou art committing every day? how art thou turned from
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:30767:258"/>
thy prophaneneſſe when it is ſtill in thy mouth, in thy words, in thy hands, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions. Oh if you did conſider you had to do with God, and ſcripture Truths will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide ſo, when ſin hath curſed and damned thee into hell, thou wouldſt not let theſe things paſſe away as thou doſt. You will know that converſion hath been preached unto you, and that all thy deſtruction and damnation is of thy ſelf.</p>

                  <p>WE have conſidered <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> Commiſſion in the two parts of it. The next thing to be conſidered, is the ſucceſſe, or the event of it: and here we ſhall finde blaſphemy writ (as it were) on their foreheads. Nothing but peremptory, and wilful obſtinacy againſt this ſo juſt, neceſſary, and reaſonable an Exhortation, And yet were this denial like that of the younger ſon in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who ſaid, <hi>He would not, but afterward repented, and went,</hi> it had been more tolerable; but they perſevere in this impudent diſobedience: So that we may take notice of the aggravation of their reſolved wickedneſſe. 1. In their perem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptory Negation, <hi>And they ſaid, there is no hope:</hi> Although it was Gods goodneſs to invite them to turn to him, it was their advantage, not his; and although he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens them with that evil he is preparing for them, yet they ſay, <hi>No:</hi> And herein their rude and obſtinate rebellion is more evident, in that they make no excuſes, pretend no reaſons, but barely ſay, <hi>They will not turn unto God from their ſins.</hi> Thoſe in our Saviours Parable, that were invited to a feaſt, though it was their great ſin to make any thing in the world an impediment to their coming, yet they feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reaſons, and were willing to be excuſed; but how they fell, the Prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> plainly ſets forth, <hi>They will be what they are, and they will not change.</hi> And this their obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy is further declared in a two fold amplification. Firſt, in that Phraſe, <hi>There is no hope:</hi> There is the ſame expreſſion, and the Hebrew word in Chapter 2. 25. ſome render it, <hi>Desperatum eſt,</hi> It is deſperate; we are reſolved to go on whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it coſts us; <hi>Vatablus, expectoratum est,</hi> in this ſenſe, our heart is wholly turned aſide, and plucked off from God; we cannot love him, or obey his commands. Others, <hi>Obfirmati ſumus,</hi> we are ſetled, and obdurate in our wickedneſſe, <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> preaching is in vain to us; he may hold his tongue, for we are ſet upon that which is evil. On Tranſlators render it, <hi>There is no hope,</hi> and that may be in this twofold reſpect; Firſt, We have for ſo long a time given our ſelves up to the waies of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſe, we have thus long accuſtomed our ſelves to them, that now there is no hope that ever we ſhould become better. Or Secondly, we have for ſo long a time provoked God by our wicked rebellions, that there is no hope for us to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with God if we would return unto him: But this ſeemeth not ſo proper, becauſe at this time God did hold out his Scepter of Grace to them if they would come in, and turn from their evill waies. Now you may demand, Whether the Iſraelites did in plain and direct terms anſwer <hi>Jeremiah</hi> thus? For it might ſeem
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:30767:259"/>
improbable that they would acknowledge their way an evil way, and yet live in it: whereas they muſt needs do ſo, if they did <hi>in terminis</hi> thus refuſe the Prophet; <hi>For</hi> (ſay they) <hi>we will walk every one in the imagination of his evil heart:</hi> Or whether doth not the Prophet ſay, <hi>They ſaid ſo,</hi> becauſe by their lives and converſations, wilfully perſiſting in their former impieties; They ſaid thus by their actions, though not by their words? They might do both; for we ſee the Iſraelites ſometimes telling <hi>Jeremiah</hi> to his face, <hi>That they would not do what God had commanded them by his mouth,</hi> Jer. 44. 16. a notable place to diſcover their avowed and open diſobedience to God.</p>
                  <p>Obſ. <hi>That there are ſome men, who though they hear never ſo much of their duty to turn from their ſins unto God, yet are wilfully reſolved to continue in the ſame.</hi> It <note place="margin">Obſ.</note> was not <hi>Jeremiahs</hi> portion onely, or the Prophets and Apoſtles in former times, but in all ages the Miniſtrie of God meets with ſuch incorrigible and deſperate hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. Let the word of God ſound as terribly, as that Trumpet will at the day of judgement: Let all waies be uſed, <hi>Johns</hi> auſterity, or Chriſts meekneſſe: the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of their ſins cannot be removed into a ſea of tears, and godly ſorrow. Do we not every day ſee this fulfilled? How few are the hearers that come with this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and prayer unto God, that they may go out from Gods preſence, cleanſed from their leproſie? That they who came ſwine, may return ſheep? That they who came Crows, may go home Doves? This undoeth you, that you come not to hear, that ye may be changed, made other men, but build ſtill upon your old rotten foundation.</p>
                  <p>To make this Doctrine like fire in your bowels, conſider, That under the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of the word there are two kinde of ſinful and wicked hearers. <note place="margin">Two kind of wicked hearers. 1. Ignorant.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Thoſe that live in their ſins, and in an unconverted eſtate, by either an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, or a groſſe ignorance. Or 2. Such who have knowledge, and yet knowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and wilfully commit thoſe ſins, that inwardly their own Conſciences, enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the word, condemns them for. In theſe two ranks all wicked men may be placed: For as for Heathens, who have a meer negative ignorance or unbelief in God and his word, becauſe they never had Prophets ſent among them, ſome (Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines) ſay they are not damned for the not knowing, or not believing of thoſe things which are manifeſted meerly by revelation; but becauſe they detained the natural light of Conſcience in unrighteouſneſs. We ſpeak not then of ſuch, but of thoſe who are under the ſun-beams of the word, and yet are frozen in their ſins, (a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels miracle) or under the ſweet droppings of the Goſpel, yet are a barren wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs: Now ſome of theſe perſevere in their ſins, from a ſinful damnable igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. They know not the neceſſity of converſion: they underſtand not what all theſe ſermons tend to: They are altogether unacquainted with ſuch a work of Gods Spirit. Tthis ignorance doth not excuſe. For the ſervant that doth not know his maſters will, <hi>ſhall yet be beaten with many ſtripes,</hi> Luke 12. 47. becauſe it is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther firſt, an effected ignorance, they deſire to be in darkneſs, and not to ſee the light, that ſo they may the more quietly, and ſecurely lye down in their ſins; they will not underſtand, that ſo they may not do good: there is this horrible impiety up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mens hearts, that they are afraid of divine light: they ſhut the eyes, leſt they ſhould behold that which is Truth, or good: even as a man draweth the curtain that no light may hinder him to take his reſt; as the thief hateth the light becauſe it diſcovers his wickedneſſe. Take heed then thou are not in the number of ſuch prophane wretches; thou careſt not for hearing, preaching, for reading the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, for acquainting thy ſelf and family with the principles of religion: This will breed ſcruples in thy Conſcience: this will make thee ſee thy prophanneſſe, thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, to be crying ſins; and therefore thou ſtoppeſt thy ear with the deaf Adder, that no inchanting may draw thee out of the hole. This is affected ignorance. Or ſecondly, It is groſſe ignorance, and that is which cometh by negligence, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane careleſneſs: and this is the cauſe that moſt in our Congregations are ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant about Religion, about Converſion, and theſe main points of godlineſs. A pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:30767:259"/>
negligence, they have no hearts, no minde, no affections to ſuch things; there is nothing belongs to their Trade, to their husbandrie, but they can skill in it, only in divine things they are as brutiſh as beaſts. Think not that this ignorance will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe you; ſay not, I am not book-learned, ſuch things are too high for me: What, wouldſt thou be thought a Chriſtian, and yet the neceſſary principles of religion too high for thee? Thou art to lay aſide thy endeavour after all other things in this life, till thou haſt attained to this: If thou doſt not eat of this tree of knowledge, thou canſt never eat of the tree of life. Oh then that at laſt God would make us Miniſters ſons of thunder, to awaken and terrifie you out of this groſſe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſort of ſinners living in their impieties, are theſe in the Text, who <note place="margin">2. Prophane.</note> have knowledge and inſtruction, yet are ſo deſperately wicked as they will perſiſt in it however: and ſuch are all wicked men who live in groſſe ſins, that are not onely condemned by the word, but by a mans own heart. There is no Swearer, Adulterer, drunkard, but he ſaith, as theſe in the Text, <hi>No, but we will go after the luſts of our own heart.</hi> Now though the other are inexcuſable, becauſe their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is wilfull, ſo theſe are much more to be reproved. Chriſt prayed, <hi>Father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them, becauſe they know not what they do.</hi> Luke 23. 34. But here it is rather, <hi>Father, let thy wrath fall on them, for they know what they do. Gregory</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe places, <hi>They go quick into hell, and the earth ſwallowed them up quick,</hi> applie it thus (if by way of alluſion it may be received:) ſuch who ſin wilfully, who know their ſin, who feel their ſin, whoſe conſciences are quick to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them: <hi>Oh</hi> (ſay they) <hi>theſe go quick to hell,</hi> and hell ſwalloweth theſe alive as it were. Now it may eaſily be demonſtrated, that many ſinners are in this latter rank with theſe in the Text, They ſay, <hi>No, we will do as we have done,</hi> take the pleaſures of ſin we uſed to do, whatſoever is ſaid to the contrary. Thus men fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low one another deſperately into deſtruction: even as <hi>Saul,</hi> he firſt fell deſperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on his ſword to kill himſelf, and afterwards his armour-bearer as violently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed himſelf. It is an heavy judgement of all judgements, thus willingly and wittingly not to murther his body, but his ſoul, which is the greateſt ſin of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murther.</p>
                  <p>In the next place conſider (as was hinted before) that two waies we may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover this obſtinate diſpoſition; either expreſly in words, by a publick owning this impudent rebellion, or in our actions and deeds onely: Of the former ſort the Scripture giveth ſome inſtances, ſuch as thoſe that ſay, <hi>The Lord ſeeth not,</hi> and <hi>bid the knowledge of the moſt high depart from them, Job</hi> 21. 14. And again ſuch as <hi>Pſ.</hi> 12. ſay, <hi>Who is the Lord? our tongues are our own, we will not be controlled.</hi> Of the latter ſort are thoſe, who though they utter not this miſchief with their mou hs, yet by their works they deny him. Therfore think not to ſay within your ſelves, We are not ſuch impudent ſinners, we do not belch ſuch blaſphemie with our mouths; for if thou goeſt on wilfully in thy wicked way, againſt all thoſe admonitions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations that are diſpenſed to thee, God will judge thee in the number of ſuch high offenders.</p>
                  <p>Therefore in the third place obſerve, What are thoſe cauſes that tumble down <note place="margin">Cauſes of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy in ſin. 1. Atheiſme.</note> men headlong this hill of deſtruction, that they ſeemed to be carried into hell as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently as the Swine poſſeſſed by the divel were into the bottom of the ſea; for men came not to be thus wicked at the firſt Temptation. And one Cauſe is, <hi>Atheiſme and unbelief:</hi> Where this is, preſently a floodgate is ſet open for all impietie and wickedneſſe, as Faith is the firſt foundation ſtone in the building of all godlineſſe: a man muſt believe that God is, &amp; that he is a rewarder of all thoſe that ſeek him: ſo Atheiſme and unbelief is the firſt ſin that makes way for all other impieties. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth there is no God, and that God is not a ſevere Judge of thoſe that do wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly. Hence are thoſe expreſſions of the moſt flagitious men; <hi>Is there knowledge in the most high? and God is not in all their thoughts:</hi> ſo that when the fear of God and his judgements is ſtricken out of mens Conſciences by unbelief, you may call
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:30767:260"/>
that man Legion, for many thouſand of Luſts will quickly poſſeſſe him; Oh then if thou wouldſt be kept from this pit of confuſion, daily quicken up in thee faith in God, and all his attributes, as the Scripture revealeth him, and fear of him in all thy waies; for if theſe will keep a man from ſwallowing Gnats, much more Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mels.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Another cauſe is long cuſtome in ſinning.</hi> This makes a mans Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence <note place="margin">2. Long cuſtom in ſinning</note> like Leviathans ſcales, as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaks of; this doth not onely make a man dead in ſin, but burieth him in the grave, and rolls a great ſtone over him: this makes a man like the fat beaſt prepared for the ſlaughter, and yet fils us for the preſent with all joy and content: Theſe often ſay, <hi>There is no hope,</hi> We have lived thus long in the pleaſures of our ſin, and they are ſo habituated in us, that we cannot do otherwiſe. Hence experience tels us, that many men ſin, and that grievouſly; yet they do not ſo much as think they are ſinners, becauſe cuſtome hath taken away all feeling from them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Proſperity and abundance of eaſe and plenty in the committing of their ſins, doth alſo make men lift up themſelves preſumptuouſly againſt God:</hi> Thus God <note place="margin">3. Proſperity and abundance of eaſe.</note> by <hi>Jeremiah, I ſpake unto thee in thy proſperity, but thou wouldſt not hear:</hi> and <hi>Sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> obſerveth it, becauſe judgement was not preſently executed, <hi>Therefore the heart of man was ſet in him to do wickedly,</hi> Eccleſ. 8 11. and <hi>David</hi> alſo takes notice of this, when being greatly troubled at the proſperity of the wicked, and relating all things are according to their hearts deſires, he addeth, <hi>Therefore violence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſeth them as a chain,</hi> Pſal. 73. 6. What was it that puffed up <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> ſo that he made himſelf as God, and Tyre and Sidon, that they ſet their hearts as God, but outward greatneſſe? therefore ſucceſſe and proſperity in wickedneſſe, makes men exceeding bold, even againſt God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Hardneſs of heart:</hi> This doth violently carry on men to wickedneſſe, for as long as that ſtone is, there can no mollifying, or ſoftening impreſſion be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. <note place="margin">4. Hardneſſe of heart.</note> Thus the Apoſtle argueth, <hi>Rom. 2. Despiſeſt thou the goodneſſe of God, and after thy hardueſs and impenitent heart treaſureſt up wrath?</hi> hardneſſe, and then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency. Oh what is the reaſon that men do not give over, but ſtill add more wickedneſſe? Is it not becauſe of this hardneſſe? It is a vain thing for the Artificer to think to bring his cold Iron into any form or faſhion before it be melted, and heated in the fire.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Deſpair,</hi> That ſometimes makes a man heap iniquity upon iniquity; he thinketh he can be no worſe then he is, and therefore he will eat and drink, for <note place="margin">5. Deſpair.</note> to morrow he ſhall dye, he ſhall be damned: Thus as you heard ſome explained this, <hi>There is no hope,</hi> that is, we have committed ſuch foul abominations, and have ſinned ſo preſumptuouſly, that there is no hope, God will not receive us if we ſhould come. This was <hi>Cains</hi> condition, deſpair made him cry out, <hi>his ſins were greater then he could bear;</hi> and therefore he never humbleth himſelf before God, but goeth on in his reſolved wickedneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>The Divels great power and dominien that he hath over ſuch men, makes them boggle at no impiety.</hi> Theſe are the Divels inſtruments prepared for every <note place="margin">6. The divels do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over thee.</note> high degree of wickedneſſe: As God hath his ſervants, and precious veſſels fitted for all his greateſt imploiment; ſo theſe are by the divel prepared for the worſt kind of drudgery: thus when the divel had entred into <hi>Judas</hi> his heart, taken greater hold on him then ever, then he can guide him to that perfidious act of wickedneſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray Chriſt into his enemies hands, yea and can ſo horribly diſſemble as to give him a kiſſe, pretending much reverence at that very time of treacherie. Thus you ſee what are thoſe milſiones that are hung about ſuch mens necks to preſſe them down into the ſea. Here muſt be one Objection anſwered, and that is, <hi>How can men ſin willingly, and knowingly?</hi> for is it not a received rule among Philoſophers, and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">Object.</note> by Divines, that <hi>Omnis peccans eſt ignorans, All ſins come from ignorance?</hi> And is it not alſo another received maxime, <hi>That no man can will evill, becauſe it is evill, Nemo intendens malum operatur?</hi> and the reaſon is, becauſe no facultie can be
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:30767:260"/>
carried out beyond his object: as the underſtanding cannot give aſſent to any thing that is falſe, it is impoſſible but it ſhould believe that which is true, or appearing ſo; ſo it cannot be but that the will ſhould will good, or what it judgeth good, How then can thy ſin, when they know it to be ſin?</p>
                  <p>The Anſwer is two-fold; Thoſe mentioned rules are true, but thus men come to ſin wilfully and knowingly. 1. Although they have the knowledge of ſins in the general, and do in the univerſal believe theſe things to be ſin, yet in the par<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>icular they do not conſider it at that moment of ſinning; ſo that if we take ignorance for imprudence and inconſideration that men do not weigh circumſtances or actions in the balance, then all ſins come from ignorance. Or 2. Men come to ſinne wilfully, becauſe as their Conſciences tell them ſuch actions are ſins; ſo their ſenſe or corrupt affections, preſent at the ſame time the pleaſure and the profit of ſin, and by this means, they take the bait, not attending to the hook; and thus the evill of ſin doth not ſo much deter them, as the ſeemiug good of ſin doth allure them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe of Admonition</hi> to all that hear this Truth. Take heed that there be not many among you of this wilfull obſtinate rebellion againſt God: How can God or his Prophets judge it otherwiſe, when he hath not onely framed evil, but actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted his ſevere wrath upon you by ſore judgements? yet many return not from their evil waies. If you are not guiltie herein, Why then after ſo many Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and admonitions doſt thou yet embrace thy luſts? What is this but like theſe in the Text? to ſay, <hi>No, we will walk after the imaginations of our own hearts.</hi> To be ſure thou wilt confirm that there is this incorrigibleneſſe, if ſtill after this Sermon thou ſhalt perſiſt in thy wickedneſſe; for it will come to this, either (Lord) I am convinced, I will ſtand out no longer, I will give up my ſelf to thee; or elſe, For all that is ſaid, I am reſolved to go on in my impieties. Oh do not think to plead igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, think not to ſay, <hi>Lord for give me, for I know not what I do:</hi> Yea thou doſt know what thou doſt, and thy own Conſcience with the word of God doth conſtantly condemn thee for it. Now conſider the aggravation of ſinning thus wilfully. 1. It is an argument of one that is hopeleſſe, and incurable; for if thou mockeſt at the day of judgement, and careſt not for the threatning of God, What remaineth to cure thee?

                     <bibl>JOEL 2. 12, 13.</bibl>
                     <q>Therefore alſo now ſaith the Lord, Turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with faſting, and with weeping and mourning: And rent your hearts, and not your garments, &amp;c.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THe former part of the Chapter is very elegant and copious in deſcribing a day of darkneſs, of thick darkneſs; that is, a day of Gods judgements, and his fierce anger. The Prophet is very Rhetorical and Metaphorical, in ſetting this judgement before their eyes. Some underſtand theſe Verſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned together, of the Army of the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> or ſome other potent Enemy, that God would raiſe againſt the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> But <hi>Piſcator</hi> from <hi>Verſe</hi> 25. doth probably gather, that this whole deſtruction in ſeveral Verſes, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. is not to be applied to any Army of men and horſes, but to that numerous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Vermine, Locuſts, Caterpillars and Cankerworns, that God ſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them to devour their fruit and corn; which the Prophet calls <hi>verſe 25. Gods great Army;</hi> and indeed the Prophets phraſe ſeemeth to conclude this; for ſaith he of this Army, <hi>verſe 4. The appearance of them, is as the appearance of horſemen, and like the noiſe of chariots upon the mountains ſhall they leap:</hi> Thus God many times uſeth the vileſt and moſt loathſom creatures, to puniſh the ſtouteſt and moſt lofty men; for as they ſay of Gods providence and wiſdom in making of the creatures, he is <hi>Maximus in minimis,</hi> the greateſt in the leaſt; ſo is he moſt dreadful and terrible, in the moſt contemptible inſtruments. It trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled <hi>Abimelech</hi> to be killed by a woman; &amp; what a debaſement was it to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi> to be overmaſtered by Frogs and Lice? Oh how greatly is God to be feared! who hath thouſands of inviſible Armies, that he can raiſe to deſtroy thoſe that oppoſe him. After the ſolemn and magnificent deſcription of this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful judgement, the Prophet adviſeth the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> what is the duty God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of them, their caſe is not yet deſperate. Caterpillars and Locuſts are loathſom to them; let their ſins be ſo, which are indeed the true Cankerworms that deſtroy their mercies: This judgement would make the earth and heavens to tremble, <hi>verſe</hi> 10. let it work ſo upon their hearts. As God would puniſh them with the vileſt of creatures, ſo let them be more vile in their own eyes, then monſters and beaſts: If they would have God turn away his judgements, let them turn from their ſins.</p>
                  <p>This Text I have choſen, becauſe it containeth the <hi>term to which</hi> of our <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion:</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:30767:261"/>
We have already handled the term from which, and that is <hi>Sin.</hi> Now the term to which is to be conſidered, and that is, <hi>God;</hi> ſo that in the words you have the preface to the duty, and the duty: The preface containeth the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and divine command inforcing to it, <hi>Thus now ſaith the Lord;</hi> its the great God of heaven that requireth this, who by his word made heaven and earth, to whom the winds and ſeas obey; how much rather ſhould man? Oh apply this to your hearts; Who is it but God that bids me turn from ſin? its not the Miniſter ſo much, its not the Meſſenger or Ambaſſador ſo much that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, as God himſelf; Is not his wiſdom and his Soveraignty enough to command preſent obedience. 2. The duty; and there is 1. The duty it ſelf, <hi>Turn ye,</hi> which is diſpatched. 2. The term to which of this motion, <hi>Even unto God.</hi> 3. The maner, <hi>With your whole heart.</hi> 4. The effects, <hi>With faſting and mourning.</hi> 5. The form or nature of it, <hi>Rent your hearts and not your garments.</hi> 6. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to incourage, <hi>For God is gracious and merciful, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We are in order to fix upon the term to which, and that is God. <hi>Turn ye even to God. Even to me,</hi> implieth, that a man may turn and turn, and yet not turn even to him; he falls ſhort of this center, he cometh not to his journeys end: From whence Obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That it is not enough to turn from our ſins, but we muſt turn even to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> 
                     <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its not enough to go out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> but we muſt enter into <hi>Canaan;</hi> its not <note place="margin">1.</note> enough to hate evil, but we muſt cleave to that which is good. Turn to me, even to me; let nothing elſe be the center, the end of your motion. This point is of great conſequence; for hereby I ſhall diſcover the counterfeit converſions of many, <hi>And ſo ſet the true and counterfeit together;</hi> and not as in other Texts, handle the counterfeits ſeparately by themſelves. That it is not enough to turn from ſin, unleſs we turn even to God, appeareth by that complaint, <hi>Hoſea, 7. 16. They return, but not to the moſt high; they are like a deceitful bow.</hi> How do they return, but not to the moſt high? becauſe they were diligent in faſting, humiliation, and the outward exerciſes of repentance, but ſtill they were hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites in heart; and therefore proverbially compared to the broken bow, that ſeemeth, as it were, to ſend forth its arrow directly upon the mark, but the ſtring breaking, it either falls on the ground, or flieth back on the face of the Archer; ſo they ſeemed by all their external duties, to aim at God, and eye him, but all fell upon themſelves; they looked no further then to their own advantages. For opening of this, conſider, how many ways men may turn from ſin, and yet not to God. 2. What it is to turn even to God. And</p>
                  <p>Firſt; <hi>Men turn from ſin, but not to God, when they commit them no more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. How many ways men may turn from ſin, and yet not to God.</note> 
                     <hi>the temptations and occaſions are taken away:</hi> So that if they would, yet they cannot have an opportunity to ſatisfie or accompliſh their luſts: There is nothing more ordinary then this, men conclude they are converted, becauſe they do not ſin as they have done; whereas the true cauſe is; the temptations and opportunities are removed; ſo that there is not the work of Gods grace changing thy heart, but the work of his providence removing the objects there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Snakes and Adders they lie in their holes, and are alive as well in winter as in ſummer, yet becauſe in winter they want the warm reviving beams of the Sun, therefore they appear not out of their holes: Thus ſin, it may be, is as lively and powerful in thee as ever, but there are not the kindely and warm temptations to draw it forth: So then, this is no turning to God, becauſe thy heart is ſtill the ſame. The Lyon is a Lyon, though his claws be pared off, and he tied up in a dungeon: That King who ſtretched out his hand to lay hold on the Prophet, and his arm withered, was never the more innocent, becauſe he did not actually commit his deſigned miſchief; and certainly if the hearts of godly men have deceived them, that they have thought it not poſſible for them to commit ſuch ſins, as they have been warned about; as we ſee in <hi>Peter</hi> about
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:30767:262"/>
his Apoſtacy, no wonder if wicked men do ſo greatly delude their own ſouls: It may be then thou canſt not be unclean, as thou haſt been, thy body is an old painful decripit body; thou canſt not be ſuch a Prodigal as thou haſt been, for thou haſt not wherewith to do it: Alas! thou art not converted from ſin, thou art onely deprived of the inſtruments of ſin; therefore ſtand thou by, for here is no glad tidings for thee.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>They turn from ſin, but not to God, that forſake their groſs wicked</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>ways, but then either go no further then meer civility, or elſe divert to ſome ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous way of worſhip:</hi> This is much to be regarded, for here men ſwallow down poyſon, while they think it is honey: And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, thoſe that turn to civility onely, dye in the wilderneſs, and never come to <hi>Canaan;</hi> yet this is a great converſion and change in the worlds account: If they ſee a Prodigal turned a good husband; if a diſſolute debauched man, a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber temperate man, they cry out, Behold a true convert! but this is to turn half way onely to God: They leave the ſin, and ſet upon the contrary duty, but from falſe and infirm principles: They turn not to God, to cloſe with him, to receive him as their Lord and King, onely they have ſome inferior reaſons, which make them thus change their lives: Fear of poverty and hardſhip makes them better husbands; ſo the indangering of their bodily health by groſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, makes them more ſober: Now in all this a man, though he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from his ſin, yet becauſe his motions are onely humane, ſuch as wiſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens have propounded to themſelves, therefore they turn not unto God: Theſe that from prophane men, turn to be meer civil men onely, and not godly, are, as it was with <hi>Jonah,</hi> who had got a goard to defend him from the heat of the Sun, and he thought now he had a ſure defence, but a worm ariſeth preſently to devour it: So thou who art turned more civil and ingenious then once thou wert, beginneſt to bleſs thy ſelf, and admire thy condition, not conſidering that for thy black coals and dirt thou didſt wallow in, thou haſt not found gold, but copper. We may indeed, as our Saviour did, look upon ſuch who have this change, and love them, and yet ſay, <hi>Thou art not far from the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> The Prophets and the Apoſtles preſs a far other converſion, then the moſt exact Moraliſts among the Heathens; when therefore thou beginneſt to turn and change, be ſure thou goeſt to the proper end of ſuch a motion; ſtay not in any thing but God; do not take up thy lodging any where, till thy ſoul reſt on him.</p>
                  <p>But the ſecond miſcarriage in turning from ſin, may be into ſome ſuperſtitious and ſeemingly zealous worſhip of God; and this is more dangerous poiſon then the former. It hath been the caſe of divers, when afflicted in conſcience for ſin, and feeling the load and burthen of it, preſently to fall upon ſome auſtere ſuperſtitious exerciſe of Religion, which God never commanded, and by this means they think to make God amends, and to give ſatisfaction; but this is not ſo much converſion as ſubverſion. Suppoſe the Phariſees had gained ſeveral pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and groſs ſinners to become their Proſelytes, to leave their former foul ſins, and to be very diligent and ſtrict in outward ſuperſtitions; yet our Saviour ſaith, <hi>That ſuch were made the children of wrath;</hi> they were not turned to God, but in ſome reſpects more from him: Take heed therefore of turning from a publican, to become a Phariſee; this is deſtruction ſtill: And yet this kinde of converſion is for the moſt part onely acknowledged in Popery; for they ſpeak much of their converts and converſion, but what is that which they ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently commend? <hi>viz.</hi> When men living in the world, and guilty of groſs ſins, do begin to feel the terror and burthen of them, and thereupon enter into ſome Monaſtery, joyn themſelves to ſome Religious order, as they call it, and this i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

one ſin; and thus it is here: To bow to Altars, to go on pilgrimage, to keep a ſtrict Lent, theſe are far more eaſie to fleſh and blood, then to mortifie ſin, <hi>Habes quod in to occidas,</hi> ſaid <hi>Austin.</hi> Though we have not Rams or Sheep to kill for Sacrifice, yet we have ſeveral luſts to mortifie, and this is a greater pain: So then, beware of this deluſion of Satan; for if he cannot keep men in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane ſecurity about their ſins, but their conſciences will tremble and cry out; then he leads them into dark ſuperſtitious ways, and ſo they damn themſelves in a narrow way, that leads to hell; for there is a broad way to hell, and there is alſo a narrow ſtraight way, which the troubled conſcience of a man findes out, wanting the guide of the Scripture: And the Devil makes ſuch take up their croſs and follow him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Then we turn not to God from ſin, when we onely change the practice</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>of ſin, groſs foul bodily ſins, to more ſpiritual ſoul-filthineſs:</hi> As when we with indignation caſt away our prophaneneſs and ſcandalous ways, but this filleth us with pride and ſelf-confidence, and a carnal truſt in our Righteouſneſs: Oh this is not turning to God, but further from him then ever; <hi>I come not to call the Righteous, but the ſinners to repentance,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, Mat. 9 13. ſuch as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready conceited with a ſelf righteouſneſs, becauſe with the Phariſee, they can ſay, They are no Theives, no Adulterers, nor like other men, theſe are in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect oppoſition to converſion. This was the great ſin of the Jews, they went about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 1, 2. to ſet up their own Dagon; but alas, that could not ſtand before God. Take heed then, that when thou haſt caſt out ſome black Devils, there come not white ones in the room; the Devil transforming himſelf into an Angel of light: Oh its a great matter, when theſe unclean ſpirits are caſt out of the ſoul, what comes in the room thereof. Alas! the Parable tells us, that a mans heart may be garniſhed and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed to prepare for thoſe Devils that are ſeven times worſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 25. and as this holds for ſelf-righteouſneſs and pride, ſo for vain diſputations, and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new opinions in Religion; for if thou haſt given over all thy prophaneneſs, and on a ſudden all thy ſtrength runs out in diſputations about Religion: Thou doſt not minde mortification of ſin, and cloſe communion with God, but thou art of this opinion, and that, and runneſt roving up and down in Religion, this is an argument thou art, it may be, unſettled from ſin, but yet not ſettled upon God; Thou art too much a ſeeker, for it may be thou haſt not yet found God. Do not thou think converſion is an exchange of one ſin from another; no, its a well adviſed renouncing of all, and taking God in the room of them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Though we leave ſin, yet we do not turn to God, when afflictions and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>calamities are the onely motive to make us keep off:</hi> So that we are beaten from our ſins, as the dog from ſheep, our hearts are not turned to hate thoſe luſts we once loved: This was that which made the Prophet ſay, <hi>They returned not to the moſt high;</hi> becauſe though they were conſtant in prayer, and humiliation, and faſting; yet it was meerly to divert judgement, and out of love to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral mercies: And thus alſo <hi>Zachary</hi> the Prophet expoſtulateth with the Iſraelites, <hi>In thoſe moneths, did ye faſt to me, even to me? was it not for your ſelves?</hi> Zach. 7. 5. If therefore theſe temporal calamities be the great wheel to ſet all agoing, you return not yet to God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Let a man turn never ſo far from the committing of any groſs ſin, yet if</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>ſtill he do not turn from himſelf, his ſelf aims, ſelf-ends, ſelf principles, ſelf intereſts, he is not yet turned to God;</hi> For converſion is the unhinging of the ſoul, hanging it upon another hinge, or ſetting it upon another bottom then it had before: Therefore the whole requiſite to a Diſciple of Chriſt, is compriſed in this, <hi>To Deny himſelf:</hi> If a man deny his luſts, his ſins, all his outward wickedneſs; yet if ſtill he hath not denied himſelf, he hath not killed the Serpent in his head, and therefore he will revive again; for therefore were ſins committed, becauſe they were ſelf-pleaſure, ſelf-eaſe, or ſelf-profit: This was the blood that ran
<pb facs="tcp:30767:263"/>
in every vein; therefore till a man be no longer himſelf, till he be converted and turned from himſelf, what a change ſoever may be in his life, yet he is not turned to God. Thus you ſee, that ſeveral ways men may turn from their ſins, and yet not cloſe with God; they are removed from their former life, as the dove was ſent out of the Ark, but they have not found any place to reſt their ſouls upon. Oh how much doth this concern you, who have made ſome motion from ſin! you will not, you cannot, you dare not live as you have done: Oh! but upon what terms is all this? Thou mayeſt turn from ſin, and yet go round and round about, till thou haſt fallen into the ſame ſins or worſe again: As ſome wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring traveller, that hath loſt his way, goeth directly to that place at night from whence he came in the morning: Oh take heed of being a broken Bow, to have all thy ſeeming turnings to God prove fruſtrated.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, let us conſider, What it is to turn to God, even to him: And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, it is, <hi>Becauſe he is diſpleaſed and offended by ſin:</hi> This is the very quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſſence <note place="margin">1. What it is to turn to God.</note> and differential mark of converſion. <hi>David</hi> bewailed this conſideration in his ſin; and the Prodigal, when he became a convert, this wounded his heart, <hi>Father, I have ſinned againſt heaven, and againſt thee, and am no more worthy to be called a ſon:</hi> All is but forced and counterfeit in converſion, till this be the great motive to ſet all on work: This will hold for all ſin, and at all times, whether in proſperity or adverſity, life and death.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>To turn even unto God, is to be unquiet and reſtleſs in ſoul, till we do</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>enjoy his favor, and the light of his countenance:</hi> So that if all judgements for ſin be removed, if all outward comforts and abundance overflow, yet all is nothing, till God be reconciled: Thus it was with <hi>David, Reſtore joy</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and heal the broken bones,</hi> Pſal. 51. This is a ſure Touch-ſtone of grace, when honors, riches, and all outward accommodations are nothing, unleſs God ſpeak peace: As <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> ſaid, when he ſpake of all the honor and greatneſs he had, yet all availed him nothing, as long as <hi>Mordecai</hi> lived: Oh ſay thou much rather, All health, friends, children, comfort me nothing, till God cauſe his face to ſhine upon me! Oh deſire to bathe thy ſoul in this meditation! this will manifeſt the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs and ſincerity of thy converſion: <hi>O Lord, in thy light is life, comfort, happineſs, and all things elſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>To turn to him, even unto him, is when the ſoul being weary of ſinful delights, and earthly pleaſures, doth wholly repoſe it ſelf, and reſt on God as its true and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>proper center:</hi> It was the ſpeech of a true Convert, <hi>Lord, whom have I in heaven but thee, and whom in the earth but thee?</hi> it was the ſpeech of the converted Church, <hi>I will leave all my lovers, and go to my firſt husband, for then was it better with me then now:</hi> Thus in true converſion, the ſoul forſaketh all, and cleaveth to him onely, <hi>Jer. 3. 14. Return, O Iſrael, for I am married to you:</hi> No converſion, as long as God is not the onely center of thy ſoul; if thou haſt other objects, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides him, if other lovers beſides him, thou art not turned even to him.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, To turn to God, is obedientially to reſign up our ſelves unto him as a Lord, &amp; our Soveraign, whoſe commands we wil faithfully obey, whoſe Laws we <note place="margin">4.</note> will readily ſubmit unto: Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> when converted, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> and the Church cryeth, when converted, <hi>Come, let us return unto the Lord;</hi> as if ſhe would ſay, <hi>Behold, here I am, do what thou pleaſeſt:</hi> So that to turn to him, is to be like wax before the fire, melted into what form God would have it.</p>
                  <p>Uſe of Examination, Haſt thou forſaken thy ſins? art thou no more the beaſt, the Devil thou waſt once? Oh Conſider, and again conſider, upon what <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> terms thou and ſin did part: How haſt thou cloſed with God? is he thy center, thy fulneſs? doeſt not thou take a picture for the true perſon? doeſt not thou lodge in ſome thing on this ſide God? Oh what ſad ſhipwrack is that which is near the very haven! To turn ſo far and yet at laſt to be turned into hell! To get ſo far out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and yet to have <hi>Pharaoh</hi> recover thee again: Fear imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and inſincere converſion, as much as prophaneneſs.</p>

The Scripture doth for the moſt part make the heart the ſeat of the rational ſoul, as if all underſtanding, reaſon, and affections were placed there, and herein it doth contradict the opinion of moſt eminent Philoſophers, who make the brain or the head, the ſeat of the rational ſoul; now ſome learned men think that therefore the Scripture makes the actions of the ſoul to flow from the heart, becauſe God doth not make any account of meer ſpeculative, or brain knowledge; but as it is accompanied with the ſtrong affections, and motions of the heart, which put a man upon practice. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerveth that looſe diſſolute practices, do not corrupt the habits of meer ſpeculative ſciences, as the Mathematiques, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but they do quickly deſtroy practical habits, as prudence and the abilitie to guide and govern our actions. Now the end of the Scripture being wholly to make us good, and to reform our lives, which cannot be done without the vigorous and ſtrong affections of the heart, doth therefore attribute all to this, in ſo much that a good heart, or a bad heart, are made the good or bad treaſury of a man. So then howſoever in ſome places of Scripture, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22. heart is oppoſed to minde, and to ſoul, and ſtrength, yet when it is put alone, as here, then it ſtands for all theſe, and in this ſenſe we are to underſtand it, <hi>Turn to God with all thy minde, thy ſoul, thy might, with all thy heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Obſ. <hi>That we are to turn from our ſins, even to God, with all our heart.</hi> This <note place="margin">Obſ.</note> [Whole heart] is but two words, but hath very great matter and conſequence in it: for a man to mourn for ſin, to ſeek to God externally onely, or with his whole heart, differ as much as a picture and a live man, as real burning fire, and painted: To leave ſin unwillingly, as <hi>Phaltiel</hi> did his wife; to turn to God with a deceitfull heart, is very abnominable. If a falſe balance be ſo abominable unto him, How much more muſt falſe and deceitful, or heartleſſe converſions?

                     <hi>Herods</hi> was, that did many things gladly, but not all things: ſuch a Convert was <hi>Judas,</hi> Did it not ſeem a glorious thing in <hi>Judas</hi> to forſake all, and follow Chriſt? but yet ſtill he kept part of his heart for a lodging to receive ſome Luſts. And ſuch half hearted Converſions are frequent in the world: Experience teacheth us of many who turn from divers ſins they once lived in; but there is one or two endeared ſins, and thoſe they would joyn with God. Thus they attempt a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, to make light and darkneſſe have communion, to cauſe an agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Chriſt, and Belial. As the Idolatrie of ſome is recorded, who feared God, and yet worſhipped the Idol gods of the Heathens: They would have the Ark, and Dagon alſo; ſo theſe would turn to God, and to ſome beloved ſin alſo, as if a man at the ſame time could turn one eye towards heaven, and the other down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Oh fear leaſt it be ſaid to thee, as it was to <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira, Why haſt thou detained part of the price? Thou haſt not lyed to man, but to God,</hi> Acts 5. 3. and ſo thou dealeſt deceitfully with God, who will not be mocked, as if thou hadſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all thy ſins, deſtroyed all thy enemies, and yet hideſt ſome, as <hi>Rahab</hi> did the ſpies, that they might not be diſcovered. Know then that he who turneth to God, with all his heart, doth not wittingly or willingly ſpare any one <hi>Agag,</hi> he doth not keep any one <hi>Iſaak</hi> alive whom God would have ſacrificed. Oh what a ſad conviction is this of the inſufficient, and imperfect converſion of thouſands: If it be with thy whole heart, How comes ſin and the world to have ſo great a ſhare of it? Remember the firſt Commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods before me.</hi> God is a jealous God, not onely when his worſhip is given to other nuncupative Gods, but when thy heart and affections are given up to any Object beſides him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>To turn to God with thy whole heart is with our utmost might and endeavor, and highest perfection we are able to cloſewith him.</hi> It is muchdiſputed in what ſenſe <note place="margin">2.</note> the whole heart is required in that commandment, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord with all thy heart, with all thy ſoul, and with all thy might.</hi> The Papiſts give too low an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, making it to be no more then ſincerely or truely. Thus they bring down the Commandment to our power, and not make that to riſe up to the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but by the concomitant phraſe, <hi>With all thy might,</hi> it is plainly meant the utmoſt perfection of a man, and therefore can never be perfectly fulfilled in this life; yet a perfection the godly have, though it daily need more perfection, &amp; in this ſenſe we turn to God with the whole heart, when we cleave cloſer and cloſer to him; and draw nearer and nearer: So that this oppoſeth all faint, weariſome, and imperfect turnings to God. God complained of the Iſraelites, <hi>That they were weary of him;</hi> and ſuch is the liſtleſneſſe of man to what is good, that he quickly turneth out of the way, or fits down before he comes to an end. <hi>Thus they did not turn to God; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in the ſpirit and ended in the fleſh,</hi> Gal. 3. 2. and that with <hi>Lots</hi> wife look back, wiſhing for their old luſts again. It was no wonder that the Prodigal ſhould with all his heart go from his ſwine, and his husks, to the dainty food in his fathers houſe; but if after that he ſhould have gone from the fatted Calf, and been weary of his Fathers muſick to his old husks again, this had been intollerable Apoſtacie. Do thou ſay then when turned to God, as the Church did, <hi>I held him and would not let him go,</hi> Cant. 3. 4. Do not go forwards and backwards as the children of Iſrael did in the wilderneſſe: Oh if thy whole heart were in this work, thou wouldſt be more earneſt, violent, and purſuing the enjoyment of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>To turn to God with the whole heart, is to do it ſincerely and uprightly.</hi> Oh this God hath complained of in the Iſraelites, that in their ſeeming converſions, <note place="margin">3.</note> their hearts were not upright, and unfeigned in them: they did but diſſemble with their tongues, and as it is ſaid of faith, may we not alſo ſay of uprightneſſe, <hi>When the Son of man ſhall come, ſhall he find uprightneſſe on the earth?</hi> He may find the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith, he may find praying and hearing, but ſhall he find ſincerity? Thus the whole heart is very often uſed in the Scripture for a ſincere and upright heart, as on the contrary a falſe hypocritical heart is excellenty called an heart and an heart. Oh this is too ordinary to pray with an heart and an heart; to confeſſe ſin with an
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:30767:265"/>
heart, and an heart: An heart ſeemingly for God, and yet an heart for ſin alſo: an heart apparently for Chriſt, and yet cloſely for the world alſo. This is commonly made the difference between the good Kings, and thoſe that had a glorious ſhew of goodneſſe, but wanted the power of it. The one is ſaid to ſeek to God, or cleave to God with the whole heart; the other had an heart and an heart. As therefore the time was once when thou wert afraid of prophanneſſe, and groſſe impieties: ſo now take as much heed of hypocriſie, and falſhood of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>To turn to God with the whole heart, is to have the heart all one in this</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>work, not to be overcharged with diſtractions and diviſions of thoughts about other things.</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> prayeth, <hi>Unite my heart to fear thy name,</hi> Pſ. 86. 11. and dividing cares and thoughts, as alſo diſtractions about many things are frequently forbidden. Oh this is admirable, and comfortable, when the whole ſoul is inclined but one way, and that to God. As the Scripture ſpeaks of a city, or family, it is excellent where they are all of one mind: ſo it is well when a man within himſelf is all the ſame way; nothing dividing, diſtracting, or diſturbing in his motions to God: to run well, and to have nothing hinder. Thus ſome expound that promiſe, <hi>I will give them one heart,</hi> Jer. 36. 32. that is an heart not divided, not diſtracted, but wholly bent upon one object. As a Kindgom divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand, ſo neither an heart in this ſenſe divided; ſome thoughts for God, and ſome againſt him; ſome affections preſſing towards him and ſome pulling back from him, ſo that if thy heart be wholly turned to God, Oh what a ſweet harmony will there be in that motion. No unequal walking, no harſh jarring: but this being the predominant object, will carry all along with it. Indeed it follows afterwards, <hi>Rent your hearts,</hi> but that is a renting off from ſin, not a renting it between God and other things. Do thou then grow acquainted with thy own heart more, ſee what it is that doth hinder thee from the one neceſſary thing: Is this turning with thy whole heart to God, when it is divided into many objects? Oh let thy heart rather be as the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was, into which they might bring no unclean thing, neither might men of no buſineſſe walk there up and down.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>He turneth to God with his whole heart, who doth not entertain any thing,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> Supra, contra, aeque, <hi>or</hi> cum Deo, <hi>Above, or contrary, or equall,</hi> or <hi>with God:</hi> So that if all theſe particulars are neceſſary, we muſt conclude that converſion is a rare work. For firſt to turn with our whole heart, is to prefer nothing above God. This Chriſt makes a fundamental requiſite in every convert. A man muſt hate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or Mother, and his own life for Chriſts ſake. Oh the wonderful change then that this converting grace makes upon a man: now his right eye, or his right hand is not dear unto him in reſpect of God, and is it not good reaſon that he who is the moſt high, ſhould have the moſt high affections, the moſt high deſires? is it not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to bid all things come lower, that God may have the higheſt room in our hearts. Oh but how many proclaim that there is a great gulf between them and converſion, for are not their baſe and filthy luſts preferred before God? is not the Divel obeyed in his luſts, rather then God in his Commandments? ſo that ſuch inſtead of turning to God, with their whole heart, thy are turned to their ſins, and to the world with all their heart: ſee then what that is which thy heart doth ſeek in the firſt place. The true Convert giveth the beſt and choiceſt of his thoughts and Affections to God: He now comes to Chriſt every day, and poureth out as it were a box of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious oyntment, the moſt excellent and quinteſſential vigour of his ſoul.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. As an hearty Converſion makes a man prefer nothing above God, ſo neither any thing againſt him, he will much leſſe love that which is hated and loathed by God. Oh then if thou art turned unto God, how comes it about that his enemies and adverſaries do ſo often lodge in thy boſome? How is it that the prince of darkneſſe findes the Gates of thy ſoul open, when the prince of Glory ſhould come in? No man can ſerve two contrarie maſters: It was a plain argument that <hi>Dalilah</hi> was not heartie for <hi>Sampſon,</hi> becauſe all her projects were to advantage the Philiſtims, that were deadly enemies to <hi>Sampſon;</hi> and ſo when all thy deſires and purpoſes
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:30767:266"/>
are to promote the waies of ſin, to further the Kingdome of Satan, thou mayeſt quickly conclude thou art far from converſion. As <hi>Joab</hi> adjured <hi>David, Thou loveſt thy enemies better then thy friends:</hi> ſo mayeſt thou expoſtulate with thy own ſoul, That it entertaineth her own damnable enemies, rather then her friends who would bring the greateſt good to her.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Hearty converſion goeth further ſtill, and loveth nothing equally with him; for where all the heart is, there all the heart cannot be any where elſe: God will have all or none. It was the falſe mother that was willing to have the child divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; the divel will take half, becauſe in that he hath all.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Still higher the true Convert goeth, for he entertaineth nothing with God: <hi>Minus to amat, qui tecum aliquid amat.</hi> So that God being the Center, and the ultimate repoſe of the ſoul, he entertaineth nothing with him in that relation. There are ſome things that do ſo challenge a primacy, that they admit nothing with them, as we ſay in our controverſies with the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> It is a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to ſay, a primary head, and a ſecondary head; ſo a primary husband, and a ſecondary husband; and thus it is here: God is the head, the ſpouſe of every faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſoul, and ſo he will have no co-partner with him. And although we are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to love lawful comforts here below, yet becauſe all are in ſubordination to him, and becauſe of him, therefore ſtill God is onely beloved. As we ſay, Such an houſe is ſuch a mans, becauſe though there be many ſervants, many attendants, yet becauſe they are but ſervants, and one maſter onely, therefore it is his houſe only: ſo it is here; The heart of a Converted man is onely Gods, and for him, becauſe though other things be received, yet as ſervants onely, and with reference meerly to God. Thus we are ſaid to turn to him with all our heart. Oh then if all theſe things go to an hearty Converſion, In how narrow a compaſſe will this work be found? Who that heareth theſe things may not cry out, <hi>And who then can be ſaved?</hi> Who may not begin to make a ſtricter ſearch into his heart?</p>
                  <p>In the next place, Conſider the effect of this hearty Converſion unto God. And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>It is inſeparable for the future.</hi> He that hath turned from his ſins to God with all his heart, will never go back again, as Hypocrites, and Apoſtates do, ſuch <note place="margin">1. Tho effects of hearty conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to God.</note> backſliding argueth that they never were rooted, or built up upon this rock: ſee how confidently that eminent Convert <hi>Paul</hi> tryumphs, <hi>Who can ſeparate us from the love of God in Chriſt?</hi> Rom. 8. And there he challengeth all things that can be named; ſo true is that, <hi>He which drinketh of this heavenly water, ſhall never thirſt more,</hi> John 6. 35. He becomes even like God: He prayeth, heareth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, and loveth God; and in theſe things he changeth not. Oh this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and unſetledneſſe, is a plain enemy to hearty Converſion.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Hearty converſion to God is inſatiable:</hi> it hath never enough of God, ſtill it would have more in him, as we ſee in <hi>David,</hi> how full of longing and pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">2.</note> expreſſions after God! It will never repent him that he did turn to God: He will never ſay, It was better with me when I enjoyed my pleaſures, and my luſts, then ſince I took God for my portion. And now here is one thing more to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> four things that never ſay <hi>There is enough,</hi> and that is a Godly heart enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>This turning with the whole heart is invincible, nothing can conquer it:</hi> This fire will dry up all waters: A man that hath an half heart, or a weak and <note place="margin">3.</note> lazy heart, will quickly be beaten back. A Lion in the way, or tall Giants will ſoon diſcourage ſome men from <hi>Canaan:</hi> but where the whole heart is fixed, there it will break through ſtone walls: Chriſt became our Saviour with his whole heart; and becauſe this Law was written in his heart, hear how readily he ſpeaks, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I come to do thy will, O God,</hi> Pſalm 40. 8. This made him conflict with Death, and all Agonies through his Fathers diſpleaſure. No wonder then, till thy whole heart be in Converſion, if thou delayeſt, and findeſt out many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="483" facs="tcp:30767:266"/>
Laſtly, <hi>This turning with the whole heart, is accompanied with much joy, delight</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>and pleaſant ſweetneſſe: What is done with all the heart, cauſeth a great deal of joy.</hi> Thus God ſaith, <hi>He would rejoyce over his people, and do them good with his whole heart,</hi> Jer. 32. 42. An admirable expreſſion to ſhew what joy and delight God would take in doing good to them: ſo that to leave ſin with ſome trouble, with many murmurings and repinings, argueth all thy heart is not in this work.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe of Exhortation, to take up this Duty.</hi> God meeteth with many hypocrites, and in nothing more then in their turning to him: men would ſeem to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, they would gladly be thought Converts, but (alas) theſe things are not done with their whole hearts. And know this, to turn with all the heart to God, is a work of great difficultie and rarity. As Chriſt ſaid in another caſe, <hi>were there not ten cleanſed, but where are the nine? There hath returned but one.</hi> So of thoſe many that pray, and weep for ſin, and ſay they will become new Converts, may we not ſay, There is but ſuch a man, and ſuch a woman, that turn with all their heart? Now be moved to this cordial hearty Converſion.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe the work of the heart is more accounted of by God, then all thy out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worſhips, though never ſo diligently, and zealouſly performed: <hi>Rent your hearts and not your garments:</hi> God cared not for rent clothes, when mens hearts were too ſound in ſin: and ſo, <hi>a broken and contrite heart, thou wilt not deſpiſe;</hi> this is preferred before whole burnt-offerings.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Thou haſt turned to ſin with all thy heart, thou haſt drudged in the world with all thy heart: Now which is the moſt large and ample object to fill thy heart: God or ſin? God or the creature? <hi>Feciſti Domine cor neſtrum, &amp; irrequietum eſt donec ad to veniat.</hi> Oh be for ever aſhamed that thou ſhouldſt have thy whole heart for ſin and the Divel, and not for God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To turn imperfectly, and faintly, will be the greater confuſion to a man; for thou hadſt almoſt laid hold on God; thou wert very near cloſing with him; thou wert almoſt entering into the haven, and then ſome ſuddain blaſts of ſin or other, drive thee back again. Oh thou that beginneſt to run in this race, What hinders thee that thou doſt not get the prize?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Thou wilt one day lament and mourn with all thy heart, that thou haſt neglected the day of converſion; but then it will be too late. Would not the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in hell with all their heart be delivered from eternal flames, and put into a day of grace again? Do they not with all their heart, and all their ſoul roar out for their undone eſtate to all eternitie? Oh that at laſt theſe Truths might prevail with you: Oh that it might be no more publiſhed in <hi>Gath, or Aſhkelon,</hi> That our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not converting.</p>

                  <p>THE third part obſervable in the diviſion of this Text, is the effect, or if ye will, the concomitant property of a cordial Converſion to God: for we being not immateriall and ſpirituall ſubſtances, as Angels are, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of a ſoul and a body: therefore many affections are required of us as ſo compounded, which ſpirituall ſubſtances are not capable of: ſuch are theſe in the Text, <hi>Faſting, Weeping,</hi> and <hi>Mourning.</hi> So that tears and bitter weeping for ſinne, are a good ſign to evidence an hearty Converſion to God. As for <hi>Faſting</hi> required alſo in the Text, that is not commanded primarily and intentionally for it ſelfs ſake, but as its inſtrumentall and ſubſervient to prayer and mourning for ſinne; for as precious ſeed ſown in Bogs and Quagmires, can never come to any maturity; ſo neither will any duty of humiliation thrive, where the body is not by faſting or debaſement prepared for it. What ever elſe needs explication in the words, ſhall be diſcuſſed in the Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>Obſ. <hi>That true and hearty Converſion to God from ſinne is to be accompanyed with ſorrow and tears for ſinne.</hi> Its not a ſlighty, formall craving of forgiveneſſe <note place="margin">Obſ.</note> from God, but the ſoul is ſo wounded and pierced, and in ſuch agonies, that many tears flow from it. The Scripture commands this ſorrow, promiſeth ſuch a mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting heart to thoſe that are converted; and we have many examples of thoſe who were hard rocks; but when converted, much water of godly mourning came from them. For a command, (becauſe ſome have thought this afflicted, mournfull ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to be an old Teſtament-ſpirit, and not beſeeming the ſpirit of Adoption in the Goſpel:) See it in the new Teſtament commanded, <hi>James 4. 9. Be afflicted, and mourn and weep, let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into heavineſſe.</hi> This is required of Chriſtians in the new Teſtament. And as the Spirit of God did once move upon the waters, ſo he will ſtill upon ſpiritual humiliation. This exhortation is directed to thoſe that were fallen into grievous ſins, and there is no other way for peace, but through this ſalt ſea of tears.

                     </gap>, that is, ſuch an heavineſſe and grief as may be ſeen in a mans very looks; Thar all may ſay, What aileſt thou? What troubleth thee? Thus as they abounded in carnall pleaſures, and ſinfull delights; ſo now all muſt be turned contrary; and as this is commanded, ſo our Saviour makes thoſe bleſſed that practiſe it: <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn,</hi> Matth. 5. 4. <hi>viz.</hi> for their own ſinne, and the ſinne of others; for they ſhall be comforted: yea he denounceth a woe to thoſe that laugh and are merrie, that never rend their hearts, or wound their ſouls for the ſins they have committed. Oh then bleſſe God, and count it an happy time, when God ſhall turn thy barren heart which was like a wilderneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into running ſtreams for ſinne. This is ſo neceſſary, that its a grace particularly promiſed under the Goſpel, <hi>Zach. 12. They ſhall mourn, as one mourneth for his only begotten Sonne.</hi> See there is the ſpirit of prayer and mourning promiſed under the Goſpel, and that for ſins againſt Chriſt, as cordially, affectionately, and a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved manner, as a mother cryeth for her onely Son. You have examples alſo for this in the new Teſtament. Did not <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> make her head a fountain of tears, that could weep ſuch ſhowrs as ſhe did? Which made <hi>Chryſologus</hi> ſay, <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarigat Coelum.</hi> Could ſhe have cryed more heartily for the loſſe of her onely child, then ſhe did for her ſins? And thus <hi>Peter,</hi> after his relapſe, upon his recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is it not ſaid, <hi>He went out, and wept bitterly.</hi> Matth. 26. 75. So that you ſee it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantlie proved, that our turning to God, ought to be with mourning and wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping: but yet the point ſo generally delivered is ſubject to miſconſtructions; and therefore take notice of theſe particulars.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That theſe waters of tears may ariſe from a four-fold Spring or Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:</hi> As, <note place="margin">I. Tears may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from a four-fold ſpring. 1. Naturall.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>There are Naturall tears;</hi> Such which come naturally from the complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or peculiar diſpoſition of the bodie at that time. Philoſophers ſay, That onely man of all creatures doth properly weep; and they diſpute much about the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe, and nature of teares. <hi>Gregory Niſſen,</hi> one of the Ancients, that had much learning in naturall Philoſophie, makes the cauſe of tears, to be the vapours that doe upon the apprehenſion of any evill, quickly ariſe by conſent from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion and ſtirring of the bowels, which aſcending to the brain, by the coldneſſe thereof are preſently heated and congealed into water; as clouds are by the coldnes of the middle Region: Yet latter Philoſophers reject this: but my purpoſe is to ſpeak of weeping and tears, not as a Philoſopher, but as a Divine. This is certain, there are natural tears, which ariſe from a tender complexion, whereby children and women are more ready to weep then men, and ſome men more then others: yea <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> obſerveth, ſome Drunkards are very prone to weep while they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound with liquor; we call them, <hi>Magdalen</hi> Drunkards, that while they are full of Beer, and like beaſts, will then crie and weep, and complain of their ſins: but theſe tears being nothing but the excrementitious humour of vapours within, they are not at all to be regarded. Some Godlie men have complained, that they cannot weep, nor ſhed tears for their ſinnes. They can for other things, Temporall evils, that afflict ſenſe, but not for ſinne. To this I ſhall Anſwer anon.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>There are worldly tears, and carnall weeping;</hi> and that is when we weep for the loſſe of any temporal mercy, or the evill of any miſery come upon us: ſuch tears are daily to be ſeen among us, who live in the world, that is nothing but a Valley of tears. This Chriſt forbade, when he ſaid, <hi>Weep not for me, but for your ſelves,</hi> Luke 23. 28. And this might be every day publiſhed aloud, Weep not for the loſſe of ſuch mercies, Weep not becauſe of ſuch miſeries, but becauſe of
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:30767:268"/>
ſin and the loſſe of God. This when immoderate, is an heavy ſin, <hi>and it worketh death,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>and is repentance that muſt be repented of,</hi> 2 Cor. 7. 10.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>There is hypocriticall weeping.</hi> The tears of Crocodiles, when men faſt and publickly mourn, yet all this is becauſe of temporal reſpects, not becauſe <note place="margin">3. Hypocriticall.</note> that God is diſpleaſed. We have too much of this weeping alſo: God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineth of ſuch ſorrow among the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and he compareth it to the how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of beaſts. All weeping and crying about ſin, if not for ſin, is but diſſimulation with God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, There is a godly weeping, which is wrought in us by the Spirit of God, and that is becauſe we have ſinned, and grievouſly offended God, which fils our <note place="margin">4. Godly weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> hearts with Gall and Wormwood: This latter is like the rain of the cloud that comes from heaven, ſweet and refreſhing; the other is like the ſalt water of the ſea, or the muddy filth of boggy places.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Godly tears they alſo ariſe from a two-fold cauſe. There are tears of hatred and indignation, or great diſpleaſure againſt our ſelves, becauſe we have ſo fooliſhly and wretchedly diſhonoured God, and ventured our eternal undoing for a moments pleaſure. There are alſo tears of love, and joy, which the heart poures out with much melting, partly becauſe they have grieved ſo good a Father, and partly through ioy to ſee ſo much grace vouchſafed unto them. The former kinde of tears, <hi>viz.</hi> of hatred and grief, <hi>Manaſſes</hi> abounded with, and <hi>Peters</hi> eyes guſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out ſuch. The latter did flow from <hi>Mary Magdalen;</hi> for our Saviour attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth all that ſorrow to her much love, becauſe much was forgiven her, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 47. and the true Convert is to expreſſe tears of both theſe kinds, of grief, and love; of hatred, and joy; <hi>Verus paenitens de peccatis dolet, &amp; de dolore gaudet; The true repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Convert grieveth for his ſinnes, and joyeth in his grief.</hi> Even naturally there is much eaſe in weeping, <hi>Expletur lachrymis, egeriturque dolor.</hi> And hence <hi>Tully</hi> complained, that though all his tears were ſpent, yet grief did ſtick at his heart, How much more will godly tears afford ſpiritual joy? Let thy heart there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be like the Stillatory, which having the hot love of God daily under it, will plentifully vent forth the warm tears of Godly ſorrow for ſin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>There may be a ſuperſtitious and Popiſh advancement of tears, and a Chriſtian Scripture-acknowledgement of them.</hi> This muſt be alſo remembred, a <note place="margin">II. A Popiſh ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of tears.</note> Popiſh commendation of tears is, when any Merit, Cauſality or Worth is attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them. Thus in Popery they make them have a ſpiritual effect, they attribute the waſhing away of ſin to them, they are judged ſatisfactory: But how arrogant is this Doctrine, to make our tears and Chriſts bloud equal? If the bloud of Chriſt only doth purge us from our iniquity, then cannot our tears, which themſelves need waſhing, as he ſaid, <hi>Lava Domine Lachrymas meas, O Lord waſh my tears, they are ſo foul.</hi> Could we therefore weep an Ocean of tears, yea bloud, yet this could not blot out one debt of ours to God. We do not then require mourning and weeping, as Friers and Popiſh Writers do: And yet on the other ſide we abhor thoſe <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> Doctrines, that make all ſorrow and weeping for ſinne to be legal, and unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming the ſpirit of the Goſpel. No, the Scripture carrieth a mean between theſe two extreams.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>This muſt not be forgotten:</hi> There is a two-fold ſorrow, or mourning; the one is intellectual, and ſpiritual; which is an act of the ſoul, whereby it deteſteth <note place="margin">III. There is a two-fold Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. Intellectuall and Spirituall, And Senſitive.</note> and abhorreth ſin above all evil, and vehemently diſlikes it, chuſing any temporall evill, rather than this evill of ſin. And there is a ſenſitive ſorrow; which is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panyed with bodily tears, and expreſſed in a ſenſible manner. Even as there is a two-fold prayer, a mental prayer of the ſoul, whereby we immediately make our requeſts known unto God; and a vocall bodily prayer, by the mouth alſo. Thus there is a two-fold ſorrow, one rational, affecting the ſoul of a man, the other ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, diſcovering it ſelf in the eyes, and face. Now the former kind of mourning, which is an act of the underſtanding and will, full of diſplicencie and vehement
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:30767:268"/>
deteſtation of ſin; this is abſolutely to be preſſed: No man can think he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted that hath not this. But then for ſenſible and bodily tears, practical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines give theſe directions: firſt that in the pangs of our converſion, and while the ſoul is in its firſt labour, then many times ſuch Tears abound: whereas afterwards in the progreſſe of ſanctification, they are not powred out ſo eaſily. Be not then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently diſcouraged, as if thy heart were a rock, and an hard Milſtone, becauſe thou findſt no affection, no melting, no tears; ſay not, Thy heaven is made Braſſe or Iron; for it may be the time hath been, that thy two eyes have been as the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the <hi>Canticles</hi> are ſaid, to be like the Fiſh-pools of <hi>Heſhbon.</hi> Remember then the bottles of tears thou then didſt fill. Its not probable that <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> could alwayes weep ſo plentifully as ſhe did at her firſt Converſion to Chriſt, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſiation with him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Divines give another good Rule, which is to regard thy pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and well adviſed forſaking of ſinne, ſo as never to return to it, more than any tears whatſoever; for Hypocrites have ſhed tears, and they many times ariſe from the bodily Conſtitution: Some can weep when they liſt; as there were women hired to mourn: and experience tels us, of many that will weep and cry for their ſins, and yet for all that commit them again. Doſt thou therefore finde that thy ſoul loatheth ſin, and that thou dareſt not, or canſt not entertain any ſin in thy life? never then queſtion thy condition, becauſe thou canſt not ſhed tears, for theſe are accidental and ſeparable, but the other is eſlential to grace; and this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the hypocriſie of manie, that becauſe they can ſometimes weep and crie, when they ſpeak of their ſins, they therefore conclude all is well, though they go on in the practice of ſin. No, its inward hating, and outward forſaking of them upon ſpiritual grounds, will more teſtifie thy Converſion then rivers of water flowing from thy eyes.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If thou haſt mourning and ſighing, becauſe thou canſt not be ſo paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately affected with thy ſins, as with temporal evils: This may alſo ſtay thy heart, thou canſt not go out and weep bitterly, thou canſt not water thy bed with tears, as <hi>David</hi> did. Oh, but doſt thou groan and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>igh after more degrees of godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row? this may ſatisfie thee: for they that hunger and thirſt are bleſſed; and if the Spirit of God work in thee groans unutterable, this is greater ſorrow than weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Groans of heart, are more than tears in the eye. When one <hi>Pſannenitus</hi> an Heathen ſaw his friend put to death, he wept abundantly; but afterwards, when his Sons were brought to ex-cution, he did not weep. The reaſon was asked, and this was returned, <hi>Leves curae loquuntur, ingentes ſtupent, Light grief may be vented, but infinite grief ſtupifieth;</hi> and ſo many times the godly heart is in ſuch an amaz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ment and aſtoniſhment that ſtupifieth it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Then onely is want of Tears for ſin, matter of trouble, when it is becauſe of want of hatred to ſin, want of meditation, or want of love to God. As for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Thou haſt loſt thy husband, thy friend, ſuch an eſtate, and thy daily thoughts of this aggravating every circumſtance, makes thee weep many ſhowrs. Now if thou didſt ſeriouſly ſet thy ſelf to meditate about ſin and all the aggravations of it, thy heart would melt as abundantly alſo; but thy negligence, thy worldly cares, thy hard heart, thy careleſneſſe that makes thee ſo ſenſeleſſe. Know in this caſe, the want of fears is thy fault, and thou doſt not meditate and pierce thy heart with ſharp conſiderations that water may guſh out.</p>
                  <p>Now let us ſee, why Converſion is to be with mourning and weeping: And <note place="margin">Why mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. 1.</note> Firſt, <hi>Becauſe the evill of fin is far greater both in the loſſe it brings us, and the poſitive damage it plungeth us into, than any outward evill whatſoever.</hi> What a ſhame then is it, to ſee people weep over their dead friends? Oh none have ſucha loſs as they have, and not to weep over their dead ſouls, for there is no ſuch loſſe as that by ſin: Shall that ſuperſtitious man make ſuch a waiting for his Idols that were taken away, and ſhalt not thou mourn bitterly, becauſe thou loſeſt God and heaven by ſin. Its the bitter evill of ſin, that makes all other afflictions bitter; there had been no other
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:30767:269"/>
evill in the world to provoke tears, had not ſinne been: This brought not onely Thorns and Thiſtles on the ground, but on every thing elſe; why then ſhall we not have mourning for that which is the fountain and root of all other ſad things?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Therefore we are to turn from ſin to God with mourning; <hi>Becauſe there is a condecency, and congruity of Juſtice in it.</hi> Its the greateſt reaſon and juſtice <note place="margin">2.</note> in the world, that as thou haſt by delight and pleaſures in ſin offended and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked God; ſo thou ſhouldſt by grief and bitterneſſe for ſin manifeſt thy love to him: ſhal there be a time when ſin was ſweet and ſhal there not be a time when it ſhal al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be bitter? Oh conſider this all you who have found the ſhort and momentaneous honey of ſin, but not the ſting of it; that have found it ſweet in the mouth, but not like <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Roll, bitter in the bellie.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Its neceſſary there ſhould be bitter mourning in our Converſion; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the manner or method God takes in bringing men from ſin;</hi> which for the <note place="margin">3.</note> moſt part is accompanied with ſuch ſtrong convictions of ſin, ſuch tremblings, and agonies of ſoul, that as the woman by Gods appointment is to bring forth in pangs and travail; ſo doth the heart of a man labour till Chriſt be formed in it. Gods method is generally to convince of ſin, the hainouſneſs of it, all the bloudy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that aggravate it, and that in a powerful, particular way; ſo that he ſeeth and ſeeleth himſelf to be this ſinner: Then God diſcovereth the exactneſſe of the Law, the ſpirituall extent of it, the innumerable curſes that it threatens to every diſobedient perſon; and laſtly, it diſcovers an impotency, and an utter inability in a mans ſelf and in all the world to help him, ſo that he is deſpairing wholly of himſelf, and receiving a ſentence of condemnation upon his ſoul, onely the grace of God comes in, before the ſoul be over-whelmed: That ſtretcheth out the hand, as Chriſt did to <hi>Peter,</hi> before he ſink in the waters. Now tell us, Can all theſe exerciſes, fears, conflicts, and commotions of heart be without mourning and weeping? It is true in ſome Converts theſe pangs and conflicts are greater than in others; yet it being Gods ordinary way to bring about Converſion by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction out of the Law, here muſt be needs great diviſions and troubles of heart.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, There will be mourning and weeping in our Converſion to God, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſympathy and natural conjunction of ſoul and body together;</hi> ſo that <note place="margin">4.</note> what the ſoul is exceſſively affected with, there is an over-flowing and redundancy of this upon the body. Thus <hi>David</hi> is ſo often in ſenſible paſſionate expreſſions of tears and deſires after God, becauſe his ſoul and heart did ſo affectionately burn after God; Inſomuch that not onely his heart, but his very fleſh (he ſaith) longeth after God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84. 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> is, Severely to reprove that ſtonineſſe and hardneſſe of heart upon many ſinners: When did they ever turn to God with bitter lamentations, and mourning, <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> and weeping? When was their laughter and joy turned into heavineſſe? You have indeed ſometimes ſeen them wring their hands, cry aloud they were undone, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their eſtates are loſt, their friends are dead, great pains and aches of body have tormented them; but not a ſigh, not a tear for their ſin. Oh know that in hell there will be weeping and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth; then thy ſins will be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in a more horrid and ghaſtly manner than now they are. A tear in the eye for ſin, is more commendable than a jewel in the ear: and if thou canſt not weep, yet ſigh and mourn like the Dove. O ſmite upon the thighes, knock on the breaſt, ſay, Even Rocks (Lord) when thou haſt ſmote them have given us water; but thou haſt ſmitten by thy Word, by thy Judgments upon my heart, and yet no mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning at all. The tears of the hearers are the commendations of a Sermon: Did you hear aright, you would pour your hearts out like water, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expreſſion is. Neither doe thou think it a childiſh weak thing to weep for ſinne: For <hi>David,</hi> who had more knowledge than all his Teachers, yet how plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull in thoſe ſhowers! Neither doe thou think it an Argument of an ignoble

                  <p>WE are arrived to the fourth Obſervable paſſage in the Prophets Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, and that is the form or nature wherein this turning to God doth conſiſt. The very being and ſubſtance of converſion to God, is expreſſed in this phraſe, <hi>Rent your hearts, and not your garments.</hi> To <hi>Rent the heart,</hi> is a Metaphor from bodies or garments, as in the Doctrine is to be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Onely two things may be taken notice of in this phraſe. <hi>To rent the garments,</hi> was a cuſtom among the Jews, whereby they did declare their exceſſive and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient ſorrow or deteſtation: Thus the High Prieſt rent his cloathes, when he charged Chriſt with Blaſphemy; and <hi>Ahab</hi> rent his cloathes, when there was fear of ſome great judgements coming upon them: Thus <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> rent their garments with indignation, when the people of <hi>Lyſtra</hi> would have ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to them as Gods, <hi>Acts</hi> 14. 14. Thus you ſee it was a cuſtom among the Jews, in apprehenſion of great grief, either for ſins or judgements, to rent their garments; as they uſed alſo to cover their heads with aſhes, and to go in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath, which outward forms of mourning, are not to be drawn into practice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, becauſe all Nations have their ſeveral ways of publique mourning. The next thing obſervable is, the expreſſion by way of negation, <hi>Rent your hearts, and not your garments;</hi> its uſual with the Hebrews, to expreſs a compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive by a negative, <hi>Rent your hearts, and not your garments,</hi> that is, rather then your garments; ſo, <hi>I would have mercy, and not ſacrifice; i. e.</hi> rather then ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: God by this teaching us, that all external duties of Worſhip and Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are nothing at all, without the gracious and godly frame of the heart.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That Converſion unto God, is accompanyed with a tearing or rending of the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obſerv.</hi> Of rending the heart.</note> 
                     <hi>heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is with as much grief and agony, as if the very heart were torn aſunder. He tells us, that turning to God doth not conſiſt in outward acts of humiliation and ſorrow; if this were ſo, hypocrites would be very diligent in it; no, there muſt be a cutting or dividing the heart aſunder, from all thoſe former ſins, that were ſo conſtantly committed. This point is worthy the Miniſters earneſt zeal, for people generally are not in earneſt about this work; they will hear much, yea, it may be, ſay much about it; but to have the heart thus wrought upon, is very rare.</p>

                     <pb n="490" facs="tcp:30767:270"/>
To open it therefore, conſider, Firſt, <hi>That the Scripture hath other equivalent expreſſions to this in the Text:</hi> That which is here called <hi>A rent heart,</hi> in other <note place="margin">Other equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Scripture.</note> places is called <hi>A broken heart,</hi> yea, <hi>A contrite heart,</hi> Pſal. 51. 17. <hi>A wounded ſpirit A tender melting heart, An heart of fleſh, A ſoft heart,</hi> Ezek. 32. All which have, their peculiar efficacy, to demonſtrate this gracious work of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A broken heart,</hi> is taken from a broken veſſel, or broken bones: Now this doth imply, what pain, what grief, yea and miſery a man undergoeth, while he is in turning unto God. <hi>David</hi> expreſſeth his broken heart, by broken bones: Oh think not then, that thou who haſt lived with an heartfull of eaſe, mirth, and carnal jollity, that ever thou haſt attained to this duty: No, this is that thou art afraid of; As <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, his ſoul hated the word <hi>Repent,</hi> becauſe he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended it a word of bitterneſs, gall and wormwood, and at that time knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Chriſt, and the Goſpel that might ſweeten this bitterneſs: Thus the hearts of many wicked men, do even hate and abhor the very name and thoughts of a broken and rent heart for ſin: They would not be put out of thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and jolly ſecurity in ſin, upon any terms.</p>
                  <p>Again, as the veſſel, when broken, hath preſently all that was in it diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and laid open: Thus it is with an heart in converſion to God, the breaking of it, makes all that wickedneſs and ungodlineſs appear, which formerly was hid and covered: Then he wallowed in ſuch foul and noiſom ways, and never took any notice of it; then he always bleſſed and flattered himſelf, ſtill ſaying, I hope in God, I truſt in God, I have a good heart, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> O but when once the ſpirit of God breaks that hollow and hypocritical heart of thine, then O what depths of iniquity appear! What ſwarms of luſt ſhew themſelves! Then thou art monſter, and abominable in thy own eyes; then thou canſt no longer indure thy ſelf, thou wilt be no longer a ſtranger, and unknown to thy ſelf. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens commended that ſentence, as fallen down from heaven, <hi>Noſce teipſum,</hi> Know thy ſelf: But (alas) they had onely candle light, or moon light, not the light of the Sun, the Scripture, to diſcover themſelves, and to judge of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by it.</p>
                  <p>The other phraſe is <hi>A Contrite heart,</hi> and that is more then broken; for this is to be bruiſed or pounced into ſmall duſt: So that this doth excellently denote, what a rent heart is; <hi>viz.</hi> An heart that is beaten into ſmall pieces, that doth not retain the outward form or ſhape that once it had; it is wholly changed and altered. Take an earthen veſſel, and let it be pounced into duſt, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth nothing of its old beauty or figure: So it is here, when the heart is thus contrite, Oh it hath nothing of its old ſecurity, of its old mirth and jollity, it hath nothing of its old falſe peace and ſelf-flattering, but becomes changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another hue.</p>
                  <p>The phraſe likewiſe of <hi>A wounded ſpirit,</hi> doth fully ſet forth this <hi>Rent heart.</hi> The body wounded, is ſubject to much grief and pain, but a ſpirit wounded to much more; therefore ſaith the Wiſe man, <hi>A wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> Pro. 18. 14. If thy heart be ever wounded for ſin, it will be the heavieſt burthen in the world to bear: Oh then thou wilt think poverty, outward torments, bodily pain, nothing to a wounded ſoul: Oh but when ſhall we, like that good Samari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, meet with ſuch perſons that lie wounded for their ſins, that we may pour oyl into their wounds! when ſhall the two edged Sword of the word give ſuch heart-wounds!</p>
                  <p>As for a <hi>Soft, tender melting heart:</hi> Theſe come much to the ſame ſenſe; for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our converſion, every mans heart is of ſtone, and adamantine, like cold iron, will receive no impreſſion; Doth not experience teach it? Why is it, that after ſo many mercies, ſo many judgements, ſo many afflictions, ſo many ſermons, men are as prone and ready to ſin as ever, but from the hardneſs of their heart? <note place="margin">What is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in the phraſe, <hi>Rent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Let us conſider, what this phraſe implyeth, Rent your hearts;</hi> and then the negative, <hi>Not your garments:</hi> And</p>

                     <pb n="491" facs="tcp:30767:270"/>
Firſt, <hi>It ſuppoſeth grief and trouble in the heart:</hi> The parts of a mans fleſh can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <note place="margin">1.</note> be rent or torn aſunder, but it muſt be with great ſorrow: And thus it is with the heart of a true convert, he findes much ſpiritual trouble and grief up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſoul; his ſoul is rent and torn into many ſad dividing thoughts, between hope and fear, between faith and deſpair, between joy and grief; as you may ſee in <hi>Davids Pſalms,</hi> ſuch contrary affections working on him, that his heart ſeemeth to be like the ſea, when contrary winds blow upon it: Oh then! this argueth, that many men have never been in theſe ſpiritual deeps, and to feel the wondrous works of God upon them; they have never ſaid to their ſins, as <hi>Paul</hi> to his weeping friends, <hi>Why do ye break my heart?</hi> They have never ſaid, O how is my heart torn in pieces! There have been bodily puniſhments for hainous crimes, when the Malefactors have been torn in pieces, limb by limb, by wilde horſes; this muſt needs be exquiſite torment, yet this hath been born; <hi>But a wounded ſpirit who can bear?</hi> Theſe tearings and diviſions of heart, when ſin in all the guilt and aggravations of it, is laid upon the conſcience, who could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, did not God ſupport in theſe agonies?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It implyeth, violence offered to the heart:</hi> Even as a garment rent, or <note place="margin">2.</note> our fleſh rent, it is even by a violent motion; and ſo it is here, in converſion there is an holy and mighty violence offered unto our unregenerate part: To take that off from the ſinful objects, it hath been fixed upon, is like keeping the greedy dog off from the ſweet blood he hath begun to ſuck: Thus the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture expreſſeth the work of godlineſs, by ſuch words as implyeth great violence and pain offered to the carnal part in a man: Hence its called <hi>Crucifying the fleſh, Gal. 5. 24. Rom. 8. 13. Gal.</hi> 3. 5. There was great violence and lingering miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the party crucified was put unto; and ſo we are called to mortifie the ſinful luſts of the ſoul; ſo that although there were no external tribulations in the way to heaven, though there were no perſecutions, no troubles, yet that which is done upon thy heart, upon thy ſinful luſts, will make the way to heaven a ſtraight and narrow way. There is a ſoul-Martyrdom, as well as a body-Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and which is more terrible for fleſh and blood to undergo, is hard to tell. No wonder then, if you ſee men ſtick ſo at converſion; O its an hell, its a torment to them; Why? the reaſon is plain, converſion is a real Purgatory; they go through fire and water to be made clean; they give themſelves to be ſacrificed by grace: Grace will not ſpare any one dear ſin or luſt they have been accuſtomed unto. Its alſo no wonder if Gods children finde it ſo difficult, ſo contrary to nature, to do any thing graciouſly; for how can it be but painful to hang crucified upon the croſs, as it were? for thus, as Chriſt dyed for ſin, ſo they dye to ſin.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>In renting, there is a ſeparation and diſunion of the heart, from that to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>which it was once united:</hi> And herein lieth the very formal nature of rending, to make a violent diviſion of one part from another, ſo that the near union is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly diſſolved; eſpecially this is ſeen in continuous bodies: And thus it is alſo in a ſpiritual conſideration; herein lieth the very proper and real notion of a godly rending of heart, when its wholly divided from thoſe ſins it did once cleave unto: This is true, that love doth make the party loving, and the object loved all one. Hence it is, that the believer joyned to Chriſt, is ſaid <hi>to be made one ſpirit,</hi> becauſe he cleaves as glue to the Lord: Thus thoſe that conſtantly follow ſins, they are made one with ſin and the Devil; when therefore they are truly converted, then comes this glorious ſeparation and diſunion; they are no longer one, but twain, now ſin and they have no more union or communion, as it were: And how bleſſed is it to ſeparate thoſe, whom not God, but the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil hath joyned together.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>This implyeth impatiency of ſpirit, as not being able to hear, ſee, or</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>bear ſin:</hi> It ſuppoſeth an extraordinary and raiſed apprehenſion of ſome dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful evil before us: Thus the High Prieſt did, when he thought Chriſt ſpake
<pb n="492" facs="tcp:30767:271"/>
blaſphemy; and thus the true Convert, he hath raiſed and aggravating thoughts about the evil of ſin; he looks upon it with a more dreadful and ſad eye then men of the world do: Doth the fleſh, doth the world or Satan tempt to ſin? Oh what horror takes hold upon him, what trembling amazement is upon him! he hath no patience, the zeal of God doth ſo burn in his heart: Oh this is a ſure evidence, that few do truly turn to God; for where is that trembling, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience in thee againſt ſin? how readily and willingly doeſt thou imbrace this Serpent, this Toad in thy boſom!</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>As impatiency, ſo indignation alſo, and high diſdain is included in this phraſe:</hi> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> when the men of <hi>Lyſtra</hi> would have Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed <note place="margin">5.</note> to them as gods, tore their garments with indignation, looking upon it as a moſt unſufferable thing; and the like indignation againſt themſelves have all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned converts; for every ſin hath groſs idolatry in it; for thereby a man at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes his ſupreame affections, deſires and thoughts, alſo to ſin, which do belong to God. The Body-Idolater, he worſhips a ſtock or a ſtone, and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down to that: Thou ſetteſt up luſt or ſin, and boweſt down thy ſoul to that: Oh then, what cauſe hath the ſoul to cry out, as Chriſt did, <hi>Get thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde me Satan!</hi> In every ſin, Satan doth tempt thee to fall down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>This doth ſuppoſe that a true Convert is thus affected, as well for other mens ſins as his own:</hi> For ſeeing this renting of the heart, implyeth a deep ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion <note place="margin">6.</note> of the diſhonor that is done to God by every ſin; then whereſoever it ſeeth ſin committed, whether by our ſelves or others, it cannot but break out in this heavenly impatiency and indignation; yea, the nearer they are to him who do ſin, if his children, if his ſervants, if his family, they are in the greater zeal: Oh then, if you ask for a ſign of a mans converſion, ſee how he is affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to other mens ſins as well as his own: <hi>When thou art converted, ſtrengthen thy brother,</hi> Luke 22. 23. Converſion doth not ſtay upon a mans own ſelf, but reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it ſelf to others: <hi>Then will I teach tranſgreſſors thy ways, and ſinners ſhall be converted to thee,</hi> ſaid <hi>David,</hi> Pſa. 50. 1. ſo that if ever thou haſt turned to God with thy whole heart, with this mourning and rending of ſoul, thou couldſt never bear ſin in others: What? can a true convert endure thoſe that are prophane and ungodly in his company, in his family? No, light can agree with darkneſs as well: Come then and behold your ſelves in this glaſs; by this ſee what judgement thou mayeſt paſs upon thy ſelf: Thou art ſo far from caſting out the wicked from thee, the ungodly out of thy family; thou art ſo far from zeal to Gods glory, to bid all evil works depart; that thou onely chooſeſt ſuch, and makeſt them the object of delight; and thou canſt not endure, but art mad through malice againſt thoſe that walk purely, and more ſtrictly then thou doeſt. Could <hi>David</hi> ſay, <hi>Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, becauſe men keep not thy law,</hi> Pſal. 119. 116. and ſhalt thou ſit in the ſeat of the ſcorner, and walk in the ways of ungodly men! Oh let this truth make thy ears to tingle, yea, thy heart to tremble: How canſt thou ſay, without groſs hypocriſie, that thy heart is rent for ſin, and yet loveſt to ſee it committed by others, thy family being like an hell, rather then heaven, wherein all kinde of impiety is committed!</p>
                  <p>The next particular is to conſider, what is implyed in the Negative or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parative, <hi>And not your garments:</hi> And that is, <note place="margin">What is imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, <hi>And not your garments.</hi> 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That no outward ſign of ſorrow or grief of heart, is regarded by God, if the heart it ſelf be not exerciſed therein:</hi> God allowed of ſackcloth and aſhes, of ſmiting on the breaſt, of rending garments; but this was as dung before him, he abhorred it, if the hearts of men were not wounded for ſin: And no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if God did refuſe theſe outward ſigns, if without the heart, when his own ſolemn and Religious duties, Prayer, Sacrifice, and the like, his ſoul did loath, while their hearts were unwaſhed, and unclean. Hence are thoſe frequent complaints and expoſtulations God hath with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> why they
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:30767:271"/>
were ſo diligent in external duties of Religion, and ſo little careful about clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and waſhing the heart: O that people could once be fit ſubjects to receive this truth. We ſtill cry, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, Circumſion,</hi> as the Jews did; <hi>Our Baptiſm, our Prayers;</hi> but O where is the man that looks to any godly work upon his heart.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Therefore is the heart thus prized above all things, becauſe that is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>of all ſpiritual life:</hi> That is the good treaſury, that is the fruitful tree; even as the heart in the body doth give life to all other parts of the whole man: <hi>My ſon, give me thy heart,</hi> ſaith God, and, <hi>With all keepings, keep thy heart, Prov.</hi> 4. This is the ſeat of all good, or of all evil: This is the ſouls Magazine, or ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Store-houſe.</p>
                  <p>Now its very good to obſerve the reaſons why God doth thus prefer a rent <note place="margin">Why God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers a rent and converted heart, before all outward acts of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> and converted heart, before all outward acts of Religion, for men do not conſider theſe things: They would think themſelves beaſts, and unworthy the name of Chriſtians, if they ſhould not pray, hear, and come to Church; but then for this curious and neceſſary workmanſhip upon the heart, they never minde it at all: Think therefore All is but a tinkling Cymbal, till God hath turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy heart thus in duties: For</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>God never commanded ſimply and meerly any outward duty of Religion,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                     <hi>for its ſelf ſake,</hi> But eſpecially he required gracious qualifications in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of them: He never commanded prayer, meerly for prayers ſake; nor the keeping of the Sabbath, meerly for external obſervations ſake; and in this ſenſe ſome expound that, <hi>Sacrifice and burnt Offerings thou wouldſt not have:</hi> If therefore theſe duties be not required, meerly and barely for themſelves, why doeſt not thou attend to that which is the principal? Oh ſay, Its not this duty, ſo much as a converted heart in this duty; its not my coming to the Aſſemblies, its not my hearing Sermons this day, ſo much as a changed turned heart that God looks at: This is the <hi>Benjamin</hi> God commands you to bring, elſe not to ſee his face. Hence when the hearts of men do not ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualize this duty; the Scripture calls it no more then a Carnal Religion, or a Religion of the fleſh, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. The Legal Rites, becauſe they did not reach to the purifying of the conſcience, are called <hi>Carnal Ordinances:</hi> See how deſpicably the Scripture ſpeaks of theſe things, when performed without ſpiritual reference to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Its <hi>Rent your hearts, and not garments, becauſe all outward duties of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>Religion, are but the veſſels or pipes which receive ſuch liquour, good or bad, as are put into them:</hi> A man may be acting his ſin, or his godlineſs, while he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of them; as the Phariſees were: Although a conſtant, ordinary neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Religious duties, be a ſure ſign of a prophane heart; yet the conſtant, daily performing of them, is not a ſure ſign of a gracious godly heart; for they are ſuch as is put into them: Even as the good Angels, and the Devils alſo have ſometimes appeared in humane bodies: And thus godlineſs or ſin may work in outward Religious duties; ſo that thoſe external performances and expreſſions, are not to be made arguments of gracious men: Theſe leaves will grow upon corrupt trees, as well as good trees.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>No wonder if God prefer a rent heart, before outward ſigns of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>becauſe theſe have been, and ſtill are conſiſtent with the moſt abominable wickedneſs:</hi> They wrought miracles, and cryed, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> who yet were found to be workers of iniquity. The Jews had their New-Moons, and their Oblations, and their daily Faſtings; and at the ſame time alſo had Idolatries, Adulteries, and all manner of outward filthineſs: So that it is a great matter to know wherein true godlineſs doth conſiſt, what is the life and ſoul of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, hearing, and all Religious duties: One word ſpoken from a converted rent heart, is more acceptable, then many thouſands expreſſed in a meer cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary and formal way.</p>

                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Is Converſion a breaking, wounding, tearing and rending of the heart? <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> then you may quickly judge how remote they are from this bleſſed eſtate, that make it their buſineſſe to keep their hearts jolly, ſecure, merry and full of eaſe. Oh they muſt hear nothing, that muſt be like a two-edged ſword at their hearts; you muſt never tell them of hell, and the day of judgement, of the narrow ſtrict way to heaven. Oh bring not theſe ſad and troubleſome things to their ears. Oh thou foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh wretch, that doſt wilfully fat thy ſoul for deſtruction. Oh think that the word of God never works as it ſhould do, till it hath grieved thee, diſeaſed thee, till it hath made all worldly delights bitter to thee. Doſt thou think to eat and drink, and ſin, and to have the good things of this life, and yet no threatning enter into thy heart? Oh wert thou not bewitched, and hardned by ſin, this preſent diſcourſe would fall like fire into thy Bowels; and if there were nothing to rend and tear thy heart, the very civil and religious rents that are amongſt us, might move thee. What woundings and rendings have there been of the body by the ſword? What religious tearings in opinions and affections? Doth not the Lord then teach us by theſe rents and diſtractions what we ſhould doe in our hearts? And if after all this thou findeſt thy heart like Leviathans skin impenetrable, and ſayeſt, How may my heart be rent, and thus graciouſly affected? I ſay, depend upon the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful preaching of the Word: That is appointed by God, not only to ſet Father a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Son, and Son againſt Father, but a man againſt himſelf, his heart againſt his heart, his affections againſt one another.</p>

                  <p>THis Chapter hath two main principal parts; the firſt is Promiſſory, the ſecond Comminatory.</p>
                  <p>The Promiſſory is of a three-fold benefit. 1. Reduction from Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. 2. Godly and holy Governours, both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical. 3. The Miſſion of Chriſt, who is deſcribed in his glorious Office, he ſhall be called, <hi>The Lord our Righteouſneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Comminatory beginneth <hi>verſe</hi> 9. againſt the falſe and wicked Prophets, as the fountain of all the wickedneſſe in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The ſins they are accuſed of, are a prophaning of the holy things of God, Adulteries, and ſwearings; as alſo Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſies, which not onely they themſelves were guilty of, but infected others al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. The wicked lives of Miniſters make a great deal of Atheiſm among people:
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:30767:273"/>
They are like poiſoned Fountains or Springs, which do preſently conveigh poiſon to all that drink of them. Now as their ſin is decyphered, ſo their judgment is threatned <hi>ver.</hi> 15. grief and heavie trouble of mind; for ſaith God, <hi>I will feed them with worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and make them drink the water of Gall.</hi> They fed the people with Gall in their deceiving Sermons, and God he feeds them with Wormwood. Now my Text doth by way of contrarie aggravate the ſad and damnable effects of a corrupt and ſinfull Miniſtry; for whereas <hi>verſe</hi> 14. he had ſhewed that they did ſtrengthen the hands of wicked doers, ſo that none did return from his evill wayes. On the contrary, in my Text he declareth the good, and ſoul-ſaving effect of it, in caſe of a godly and conſcientious diſcharge of their Function. So that in the words you have good qualifications ſuppoſed: and ſecondly the godly and bleſſed ſucceſſe that will flow from hence.</p>
                  <p>The good qualifications ſuppoſed are two.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>If they had ſtood in my Counſell.</hi> To underſtand the full ſenſe of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22. 19. and <hi>Job</hi> 1. 6. Where God is deſcribed as a Judge ſitting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Throne, and all the Hoſt of heaven ſtanding by him on his right hand, and on his left; ſo that the meaning is, If thoſe Prophets had not delivered the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of their own hearts, but had attended for my commands, had received all from me, as the Angels do; then, &amp;c. And further note, that To ſtand before one, is an Hebraiſm, deſcribing the ready poſture of ſervants, to receive any command. Thus <hi>Gehezi</hi> is ſaid to ſtand before his Maſter; and we are forbidden to offend any of thoſe little ones, becauſe their Angels behold alwayes the face of God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 20.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond qualification floweth from the former, <hi>And cauſe the people to hear my words.</hi> The falſe Prophets preached their own words of peace to them, whom God curſed; but they muſt be like the Trumpet, that ſends forth no other voice than was breathed into them. Embaſſadors muſt keep themſelves ſtrictly to the words of their Commiſſion; and Executors to the Will of Teſtators: for If it be but a mans Teſtament, no man may add to it, how much more to a Divine?</p>
                  <p>The next thing ſuppoſed, is the good ſucceſſe, <hi>They ſhall be Fiſhers of men</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; though while they followed their own ways, they laboured all night and day, and took nothing; yet then Chriſt will command them to throw in the Net, and they ſhall catch abundantly. When they thus water and plant, God will give great increaſe.</p>
                  <p>Doctr. <hi>That the Miniſtry of God faithfully diſcharged, according to Gods own</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Doct.</note> 
                     <hi>Counſell, is a ſure way to turn men from their ſins.</hi>

                  <p>To explain this, conſider:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That God hath firmly and immoveably ſet Miniſters and Paſtors, or their Office in the Church, for glorious and ſupernatural effects.</hi> That although God was pleaſed to make the world, the old Creature, by his own word immediately, uſing no Angels, or other things as inſtruments (nay they could not be uſed inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally to that infinite work of Creation) yet he is pleaſed to appoint ſpirituall Officers in the Church, <hi>To be co-workers,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>with him,</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 1. Not that they co-operate with God in the infuſing of grace in the ſoul, (no, that is Gods ſole work) but they prepare and diſpoſe the ſubject in a morall way, by convincing and inſtructing the Conſciences of their hearers. That God hath thus firmly appointed ſuch ſpirituall Offices is plain, 1 <hi>Cor. 12. 28. God hath ſet ſome</hi> in his Chnrh, ſet as he hath ſet the Sun and Stars in the Firmament: and then he reckons up extraordinary and ordinary Offices; and theſe are called gifts given to men, and the fruits of his Aſcention, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 11. where they are again enumerated: So that by theſe places, you ſee a Miniſtry is a Divine Office, a plant of Gods own planting: and that it is not a temporary, but a perpetual Office appeareth by their end, which is perpetual, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 13. till we all come to a full ſtature in Chriſt: And the Apoſtle in his Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy,</hi> laying down the Characters and Qualities of
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:30767:274"/>
ſuch who are to be Miniſters, he chargeth thoſe Commandments to be kept impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially till the coming of Chriſt. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. 21.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>As God hath appointed this Office, ſo it is the expreſſion of his wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full goodneſſe and love to mankind therein.</hi> Hence God doth ſo often tell the <hi>Jewes</hi> of this his great love to them, that he ſent them his Prophets, riſing early and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them: and in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. they are called the gifts, which Chriſt gave after his Aſcenſion; and indeed they are greater than any temporall mercies, if men could ſpiritually judge. The giving of us the heavens and the earth, with all the abundance thereof, is not like to the giving of faithful Miniſters to a people. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God to comfort the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> when they were in great extremities, he tells them, <hi>He will give them ſuch Paſtors as ſhall rule after his own heart,</hi> Jer. 3. 15. <hi>And their eyes ſhall ſee their Teachers, though he feed them with the bread of affliction,</hi> Iſa. 30. 20. Hence are thoſe triumphing expreſſions to them by the godly; <hi>How pleaſant are the feet of thoſe who bring the glad tidings of the Gospel?</hi> Rom. 10, 15. And how can it be but thought an exceeding great mercy, when God who needeth us not, ſhall yet ſend his Embaſſadors daily to us, to intreat us to be reconciled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him? As if a glorious Emperor ſhould ſend Meſſengers to win the affections of a poor deſpiſed Beggar to be eſpouſed to him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The end of this Office is ſupernaturall, for divine and ſpirituall effects.</hi> And herein it differeth from all earthly imployments, who have onely outward <note place="margin">3. The end of the Miniſtry is ſupernaturall, and four-fold.</note> happineſſe and proſperity for their end. Hence it is that they are called Angels; their imployment being ſacred and heavenly, like that of the Angels. Now this ſupernaturall end is reduceable to a fourfold effect.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>They are appointed for the Converſion, and ſpirituall change of the hearts and lives of thoſe to whom they are ſent.</hi> What a wonder was that of <hi>Peter,</hi> who <note place="margin">I.</note> Converted three thouſand at one time from their former ignorance and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe! Let not the Heathens any more boaſt of their <hi>Orpheus</hi> and his Harp, which would make wild Beaſts came, and follow him; Here <hi>Peter</hi> doth farre more by the ſpiritual Keys of his Miniſtry: and thus <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>James 1. We are begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by his word, and its the Word of Regeneration.</hi> Hence they are called Fathers, ſpiritually begetting Children unto them in the Lord. And if that be true, as it is, which <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Converſion of the ſoul is a greater wonder than any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle;</hi> then where the Miniſtry hath this Divine effect, its more admirable than to cure blind eyes, or deaf ears, or raiſe dead men from the grave. Oh then this is a ſtrong and mighty experiment of Gods work in the Miniſtry, when it doth reach thus into the inward hearts and conſciences of men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Another main end is to confirm and ſtrengthen thoſe that are converted;</hi> To make them grow more and more, as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. till we come to a full ſtature in <note place="margin">II.</note> Chriſt. Its pride and arrogancy to think thy ſelf ſo knowing, or ſo godly, as not to need a Miniſtry; for ſuppoſe thou doſt hear no more than what thou knoweſt, yet how dull are thy affections? how apt to apoſtatize, and back-ſlide! and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the righteous man he needs <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Watchman as well as the wicked, that he may not turn from his righteouſneſſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. And this is a noble fruit of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, to build up, when a foundation is already laid, to be adding cubits to thy ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to be always blowing upon thee with this ſpiritual wind, that thy graces may be flouriſhing and ſweetly fragrant alwaies.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Another effect is to revive and comfort thoſe that are caſt down</hi> with the ſenſe and burden of their ſins. Hence they are ſaid to preach glad-tidings, and this <note place="margin">III.</note> is called the tongue of the learned, to ſpeak a word in ſeaſon to thoſe that need comfort. Theſe are the good <hi>Samaritans,</hi> that bring precious oil, theſe apply the Balm of <hi>Gilead:</hi> And oh that we had more ſubjects to improve this glorious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Miniſtry upon: A wounded conſcience for ſin, is an unknown thing to men of the world: To feel the Agonies of ſinne through Gods diſpleaſure, becauſe of our iniquities, is a Riddle to natural men: but where ſuch are, how welcome are the glad tidings of a Chriſt untothem!</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="497" facs="tcp:30767:274"/>
Laſtly, <hi>To direct in matters of doubt</hi> and to adviſe in caſes of Conſcience. Hence <note place="margin">IIII.</note> they are compared to light, and to guides, that lead the blind, and direct in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known and dangerous wayes: and certainly, this is no mean task: Who is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for this very imployment, To determine in perplexed caſes of Conſcience, what is to be done, and not to ſin? Thus <hi>Paul</hi> determines many caſes of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in his Epiſtles, about eating, and not eating, about preſence in Idololatrical Temples, about marriage and ſingle life, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. and the meeting of a Synod at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Act. 15. was in one part to adviſe in matters of conſcience. Theſe are the four noble and ſupernaturall ends, for which God hath appointed this Office; ſo that we are to attend upon the Miniſtry, and to expect theſe divine effects in no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ordinary way; for Chriſts promiſe is to be expected only where his Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The wiſdome of God is herein obſervable, <hi>That having appointed the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>Miniſtry for ſuch ſupernaturall effects, he is pleaſed to uſe ſuch outward contemptible means. We carry,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>this Treaſure in earthen Veſſels,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 7. The Veſſel is contemptible and unworthy, yet the treaſure therein is glorious: That God ſhould work ſuch admirable effects in a way ſo unlikely to fleſh and bloud; this was to confound the world; for when he appointed the twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, who did more to change mens hearts, than ever all the Emperors could do to propagate their Empire by the ſword; how mean and deſpicable were they? Thus God hath ſtill appointed, that not the humane eloquence and externall pomp of the world, ſhould be inſtrumentall to this ſavoury and ſpiritual operation; But the plain and ſimple Explication and Application of Gods Word; which made <hi>Paul</hi> truly ſay, <hi>That God hath choſen the fooliſh and weak things of the world, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the wiſe and ſtrong,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. Hence <hi>Rom. 1. Paul</hi> again cals it, <hi>The fooliſhneſſe of Preaching<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>;</hi> that is, in the eyes of carnall and humane wiſedome. The <hi>Jews</hi> they require a Sign, and the <hi>Greeks</hi> wiſdome, that is, eloquence and acute demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations: But this fooliſhneſſe of Preaching, is the power of God to ſalvation. Oh then take heed, that vain carnall pride and contempt doe not hinder thee from this ſpiritual good; as <hi>Auſtin</hi> was offended at the ſimple and plain ſtile of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he found not ſuch ſwelling, tuned eloquence, as in humane Authors, which made him ſay, <hi>Dedignabar eſſe parvulus.</hi> Oh know, that unleſſe a man become like a little child, he can never with faith and trembling receive this word aright. I wonder not then, if the great wiſe men of the world do ſo undervalue this plain way of Gods Word preached; They cannot become like little children.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, Conſider, <hi>That although the Office and Miniſtry of the Church be thus</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>ordained and owned by Chriſt; yet ſo univerſall and generall may the ignorance and corruption be of thoſe that are in this Office, that the clean contrary to Gods end is brought about.</hi> In ſtead of Inſtruction, men are more nouriſhed in Ignorance; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Converſion, men more ſtrengthened in their wickedneſſe; as the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſpake peace, and promiſed good to thoſe whom God abhorred. Oh this is the moſt fatall judgement that can befall a people, to have blinde, ignorant, dumb and ſcandalous Miniſters; and although people generally may love to have ſuch, becauſe ſome eyes cannot abide the light; yet its the heavieſt expreſſion of Gods wrath upon a people. This Chapter complaineth that from ſuch falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets all evill came to <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Even as if the Sun and Moon ſhould be turned into darkneſſe and bloud; ſo is it, when thoſe that ſhould be guides, eyes, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are clean contrary: onely by the way, when theſe are called here falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, obſerve, that they may be called falſe in two reſpects, either in regard of their Office, or in regard of their matter; of their Office, and ſuch are falſe Prophets, or falſe Miniſters, as have no true Call either mediate or immediate from God: So that although a man ſhould preach that which is true and good matter; yet if he have not lawfully entred into this Office, he is a falſe Prophet. Conſider that remarkable place: <hi>If there ariſe a falſe Prophet, who foretels a thing, and the thing come to paſſe, I the Lord doe it to try you,</hi> Deut. 13. 1, 2, 3. Obſerve, that a falſe Prophet may
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:30767:275"/>
tell thoſe things that are true; and God doth thus wiſely and juſtly permit theſe things, to try people whether they be ſoundly rooted, or not.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, a falſe Prophet or Miniſter is he, who though he have a true Cal, yet preacheth falſe and corrupt matter to pleaſe ſinners: Thus theſe here are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for both: They run, and I ſent them not, they were forward, and yet had no Call. Thus they preached peace to obſtinate ſinners, and incouraged them in their wickedneſſe. Marvell not at it, if the Sons of <hi>Levi</hi> ſometimes need to be purified, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. And the Devils main deſign is either to overthrow the Miniſtrie, or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt it.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly therefore, if ſo be that Miniſters would find the ſpiritual effect of their Miniſtry; and that Gods promiſe and power might go along with their Office, they are here directed to ſtand in Gods Counſels, that is, wholly to be inquiring of him, and directed by him: for to convert ſouls being it ſelf ſupernatural, the means alſo muſt be ſupernatural, and that can be known only by divine Revelation. What coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel therefore is it, which God giveth them, in the exerciſe whereof this comfortable effect may be produced? And,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That which is to be done before all other things, is to reform their own lives;</hi> That the world may ſay, they believe that to be true which they preach to others. Thus <note place="margin">What Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters muſt doe that their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrie may be effectuall. 1.</note> they are to be an example of all purity, chaſtity, meekneſſe, faith, temperance, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly-mindedneſſe. Not but that wicked men will cavill and find ſpots in the Sun. You ſee Chriſt and the Apoſtles were much traduced, and they walked through good report and bad; but let them approve their works to the Lord, and then they ſhall have comfort. Thus the Apoſtle to <hi>Timothy; Attend to thy ſelf, and to thy Doctrine, 1 Tim. 4. 13. ſo ſhalt thou ſave others:</hi> To himſelf firſt, and then his Doctrine; the life of a man preacheth; <hi>Aarons</hi> Bels hung at his feet. What an uncomely thing is it to ſee a foul deformed Painter to draw a curious lovely Image? No leſſe is it to hear a prophane Miniſter preſſing his people to purity; a diſſolute Miniſter to urge his people to ſtrictnes: and therefore God threatned in <hi>Malachy, To make the Prieſts contemptible, and as Dung, becauſe they had not kept his Word, Mal.</hi> 2. 3. This is woful: But when the Miniſtrie, for their faithfulneſs and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the wickedneſſe in the world, are then as the Apoſtles were, <hi>made the off-ſcouring of the World;</hi> this is glorious.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>To take Counſell from God, is when they preach true Scripture,</hi> ſound Doctrine, which is after Godlineſſe; for ſo the Apoſtle deſcribeth it, <hi>which is after</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>godlineſſe:</hi> To pleaſe your ears, or delight the fancy, is not an acceptable work to God; no more than if a Prieſt in the old Law in ſtead of offering a Lamb, or Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, ſhall Sacrifice a Butter-flie, or a Peacock, becauſe of the radiant colour. No, you are to feel it as a two-edged ſword, as an hammer; and the neglect of this ſolid Scripture-Preaching, hath made many Miniſters through carnal affectation vent themſelves into vapors and meer froth; and the people have been fed with wind, inſtead of ſolid food. <hi>What hath the Chaff to do with the Wheat?</hi> ſaith the Prophet in this Chapter. As it was ſaid, He had made great Progreſſe in Rhetorick, to whoſe Palate <hi>Tullies</hi> phraſe was pleaſing, which is not ſo ſwelling and affected as ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: So he is a good judicious hearer, and like to get good by preaching, to whom the Scripture matter appeareth ſound, admirable full of Majeſtie and worth.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>As he is thus to preach ſound Doctrine, ſo there are ſeveral qualifications which are like whetting, to make this two-edged ſword enter the more powerfully.</hi> Such are our zeal and tender compaſſion to mens ſouls, to cry out with <hi>Rebecca, Give me</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>Children, or elſe I dye.</hi> Our Saviour Chriſt, when he ſaw multitudes of people, though they enjoyed the Teaching of the Scribes and Phariſees, which had ſome good uſe in it, elſe our Saviour would not have directed the people to hear them; yet its ſaid, <hi>His Bowels were moved with compaſſion towards them, when he ſaw them,</hi> as Sheep without a Shepherd: Zeal makes the ſpiritual meat hot, and ſo the fitter for digeſtion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Boldneſſe to reprove ſin; <hi>Rebuke with all authority. Ieremy</hi> muſt not fear the
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:30767:275"/>
faces of men, leſt God confound him before them: That which ſome in a crafty inſnaring manner ſpake to Chriſt, <hi>Maſter, we know thou ſpeakeſt the truth, and art <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Charge them that be rich in this world, <hi>That they be not high minded; We have not received the ſpirit of fear,</hi> but of power. Thus <hi>Iohn</hi> to <hi>Herod, Paul</hi> to <hi>Felix, Chryſostome</hi> to <hi>Eudoxius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. With labour and diligence, <hi>Preach in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon:</hi> All their names and titles imply diligence, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="4">4. Conſideration of their great account which is to be given not onely for their own ſins, but of all others committed to them. The Sacrifice that the Prieſt was to offer, was greater than that the King was, yea as great as the whole Congregation for all their ſins: to ſhew that their ſins as Miniſters were of an horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aggravation; which made <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> wonder, if any in that Office could be ſaved; and indeed with God this is poſſible, and not with man.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, all theſe muſt be coupled with earneſt prayer to God for a bleſſing upon his word; for its he that teacheth to profit; he opens eyes, he changeth hearts; he raiſeth up the dead. We may lay the ſtaff as <hi>Gehezi</hi> did, but God giveth life. Chriſt preached in the day time, and prayed in the night: While thou rageſt, fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, and art full of heart-burnings againſt them; little doſt thou think what earneſt praiers he puts up to God, that his word may be bleſſed to thy ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Uſe of <hi>Examination:</hi> Whether the word preached hath obtained this ſaving <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> effect upon your ſouls, although the Miniſters of God have ſtood in his Counſel. Have they been able to ſay, we have not ceaſed to give them daily warning? O Lord, thou knoweſt our pains, our prayers, our deſires; and yet they are trees that bring forth no fruit. Well, God will ſay to ſuch, <hi>Well done, thou good and faithfull Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, Thou haſt delivered thy ſoul, their bloud will be required at their own hands.</hi> Its the great queſtion' Why Converſion is not ſo frequent, and ordinary now, as in the Primitive times, yea as at the firſt reformation out of Poperie? To that we may ſpeak the next day: only know, Gods anger is gone out againſt men, that he makes them have miſcarrying wombs and dry breaſts. How few Miniſters can ſay, as <hi>Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, Behold I and the Children which thou haſt given me.</hi> We would fain, as <hi>Iacobs</hi> ſonnes were commanded to bring <hi>Benjamin</hi> with them into his Fathers preſence: ſo gladly when we ſhall appear before God, would we alſo bring all our hearers with us, ſaying, Not one of them committed to my charge is loſt: but we have too many ſons of perdition.</p>

                  <p>A Faithful Miniſtry (as you have heard) following the counſel of the Lord, is the ſure and ordinary way for converſion of men from their evil waies. This Doctrine hath been explained: Let us now Anſwer ſome material queſtions which will further clear this point.</p>
                  <p>And Firſt, <hi>It may be demanded Whether that Miniſtry which doth indeed ſtand in Gods eouncel, may not for all that be without this spirituall ſucceſſe?</hi> May not they <note place="margin">Whether a godly miniſtry may not be without any great ſucceſſe.</note> for all that ſee no good and comfortable iſſue of their labours?

                  <p>I Anſwer, That it doth too often fall out, that even thoſe who ſtand in Gods couſel, that follow this ſtar, do yet plough and ſow upon the rocks, and ſee no <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> ſeed grow up. Therefore this Text or Doctrine is not ſuch a general, but that it hath its exceptions; and if we will ſeek for inſtances, how plentiful are they to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm this: Shall we think that this <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> who is ſo zealous againſt the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, that he did not take a true and faithful courſe in his Miniſtrie, yes, his whole propheſie doth manifeſt that.

Yea, what need we go further for witneſſe to confirm this, when Chriſt himſelf, in whom were all the treaſures of wiſedome and holineſſe, and no man ever preached like him; yet the number of his converts were few, in reſpect of the multitude he preached unto, which made him ſo bewail

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>From the freedome and arbitrarineſſe in his works:</hi> He doth in heaven and earth whatſoever he pleaſeth. <hi>The ſpirit bloweth where it liſteth,</hi> John 3. Though therefore God hath tyed and bound us to wait on the Miniſtrie, we muſt frequent the Ordinances, yet he hath not bound himſelf to work at every time, to every Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory. God keeps this ſoveraignty to himſelf: one Miniſtrie ſhall be more ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full then another, and at one time more then another, and to ſome people more then others: Yea, many times God makes the weakeſt, and moſt unlikely Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie to be more fruitfull then a learned able one: even as <hi>Leah,</hi> that was more deformed, had more Children then <hi>Rachell,</hi> who was more comely and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull. So that as it is ſolely in Gods will, to whom he will to ſend a faithfull Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, he gives to ſome that make no uſe of it, yea that hate it and are weary of it; and again denieth it to others that long for it, or that would with the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians and Sydonians manifeſt greater affections to it. Thus alſo when he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed this Miniſtrie upon a people, it is ſucceſſeful no otherwiſe then he will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point: And herein we are to advance Gods diſpenſations, which are wiſe and juſt, though the reaſons be not alwaies viſible to us. Even as although God gave the Apoſtles power to work miracles, yet they could not do theſe when and where they pleſed, for then <hi>Paul</hi> would have recovered <hi>Epaphroditus;</hi> but they did them only when he vouchſafed power. So that it is not of us that plant or water, <hi>But of God that giveth encreaſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A ſecond reaſon on Gods part is his juſtice:</hi> For when a people have by their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <note place="margin">2.</note> obſtinacy, and unfruitfulneſſe under the means of Grace, provoked him to anger, he doth inflict that juſt judgement of a blinde mind, and an hard heart, never to underſtand or be converted: and this is very wofull, but very ordinary. Thus <hi>John</hi> 12. This is the reaſon why the Jews, notwithſtanding the daily preaching they had heard with their ears, and the miracles they had ſeen with their eyes, yet it is ſaid, <hi>They could not believe, becauſe of that ſpirituall judgement which was upon their ſouls.</hi> And thus it was alſo with <hi>Eſaias,</hi> Cap. 6. He is ſent, not to turn them from their evil waies, but accidentally through their corruption, to make them more obdurate, Oh then if we ſee where much faithfull preaching is, yet little Converſion, let us fear and tremble at the wrath of God upon ſuch a people. If God hath given them up to their own luſts? If he hath ſmitten them with blindeneſſe of minde, and wilfull rebellion againſt his word, then they are under the judgement of all judgements? And is not this anger of God viſibly gone out againſt all our Congregations? Was it not a plain demonſtration that God had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken <hi>Saul,</hi> when he would neither anſwer him by Prophet, or <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> or any other way? So it is thy caſe; Neither prayer for thee, or preaching to thee is made powerfull to convince thy Conſcience, to change thy heart: Oh men in the ſtate of Gall and Worm-wood, though they think not, or believe not ſo of themſelves. Thou ſhouldſt after every Sermon ſay, <hi>Oh Lord why is it that this word hath not yet turned me from my ſins? Oh what is the matter that it hath not ſuch power upon me? Oh what ſhall I do? Have pitty upon me, O God, and ſoften my heart. Have pitty upon me, O ye Miniſters, and pray for me, that God would give me a ſoft heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another reaſon why the Miniſter, though faithful, may not yet rejoyce to ſee <note place="margin">Reaſons from the Miniſtry</note> the good fruit of his labours, is from the Miniſtry it ſelf, and that two wayes allſo.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The Miniſtry doth not work like a natural cauſe to the Converſion of men,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note>
                     <pb n="502" facs="tcp:30767:277"/>
as fire burneth, and the ſtone falleth down, but as a meer inſtituted, and Morall cauſe, as they call it, that is by the Councell and power of God accompanying it. If it did work as a natural Cauſe, from an inbred power, in it ſelf, then it would work alwaies alike; then it would never be fruſtrated of its operation without a miracle: as that the fire did not burn the three Worthies, it was a miracle. If the Word of God preached ſhould turn men from ſin this way, it would be a miracle that every Sermon, did not convert every ſinner: but it works onely as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted cauſe. And thus as the pool of <hi>Betheſda</hi> did not at any time vouchſafe healing, but when the Angel deſcended into it: ſo neither do our Sermons upon every perſon, and at any time work upon thoſe that hear; but as Gods power ſhall come in; and therefore as was ſaid at the Sacrament, ſhould be alſo at preaching, <hi>Surſum Corda,</hi> lift up your hearts to him that is a Teacher in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: as he Baptiſeth not with water, but with fire; ſo he teacheth by fire alſo. And this ſhould direct people by earneſt prayer to look up to him: ſay, <hi>Lord, if thou goeſt not along with me in hearing; if thou speakeſt not to my dead heart to live, to my hard heart to become ſoft, it cannot be. Lord if thou hadſt been here,</hi> ſaith ſhe, <hi>my Brother had not dyed</hi> And ſo may we ſay, Lord, if thou hadſt gone along with this Sermon, with this truth, it had not periſhed without profit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The Miniſtry, though faithfully diſcharged, yet is in a ſubſervient way to Gods election.</hi> Now many are called that are not choſen: the Miniſtry is ſent where election hath not to do ſometimes: But then to ſuch it is like an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Medicine that is onely proffered, and not received to work any good: where therefore the Word of God doth convert and make theſe admirable changes, it is but the execution of Gods Election from eternity. Thus it is ſaid, <hi>As many believed, as were ordained to eternall life,</hi> Acts 13. 48. And <hi>Paul</hi> was to preach at one place, becauſe God had many people there; ſo that <hi>Election is ſure to obtain,</hi> Rom. 11. 21. Wonder not then that the Miniſtry doth not Convert all, no more then that God doth not Elect all. For on whom God hath fixed this purpoſe of Love, there he will take away the Heart of ſtone, make plain the higheſt moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and change a moſt ravening Wolfe into a Lamb.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Therefore a Godly Miniſtry following Gods Councel, may yet bring forth none, or very little fruit, becauſe of conſiderations on the Miniſters part alſo:</hi> For <note place="margin">Reaſons on the Miniſters part.</note> as in the Old Teſtament, though encreaſe of Children were promiſed as a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; yet many good women were much afflicted with barrenneſſe, as <hi>Sarah, Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel, Hannah,</hi> and others: So it may be here in the diſpenſations of Gods word. Thoſe that have received five, or ten, may be diligent in employing of it, and yet have no more encreaſe then he that hid his Talent in a Napkin, though with leſſe guilt: For ſucceſſe is Gods work, not the Miniſters duty. And this may be</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>To humble Godly and faithful Miniſters.</hi> Had they a multitude of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts? Did they ſee God ſo viſibly go along with them? this might ſtirr up pride <note place="margin">1.</note> and vanity in them, as multitude of revelations was in danger to puff up <hi>Paul.</hi> The Diſciples when they returned from their ſpiritual progreſs to Chriſt, were carnally rejoycing that the Divels were ſubject to them; and they could work miracles in his Name, our Saviour to humble them ſaith, <hi>Rejoyce not in this, but that your names are written in heaven,</hi> Luke 10. 20. God therefore may ſay not in anger, as he to <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>alum,</hi> but in mercy, Write this man childleſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God may give no more ſucceſſe, <hi>to draw out their Grace, and their love to him the more:</hi> For this is a great teſtimony of it, when we can rejoyce <note place="margin">2.</note> that Gods work goeth on, though he will not uſe us as inſtruments. Wee ſee <hi>Johns</hi> Diſciples had ſome envious thoughts to Chriſt, and his; and therefore told <hi>John, That all went after him whom he Baptized;</hi> now ſee how graciouſly <hi>John</hi> anſwers them, <hi>I told you I was not the Meſſias, but I muſt decreaſe, and he muſt encreaſe, John</hi> 3. 30. The Phariſees envy againſt Chriſt, becauſe the multitude ran after him, did work the clean contrary to that in <hi>John,</hi> even to the killing of him. It
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:30767:277"/>
much that affection in <hi>Sarah,</hi> to be willing <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhould have children, though it was not by her: There is this corruption in us, that we onely would be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments God ſhould uſe. As he ſaid in vain glory, <hi>This is the Babylon I have built;</hi> ſo we, This is the Jeruſalem I have built.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Hereby God would teach even faithful Ministers, that he needs no mans</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>parts, no mans gifts or abilities:</hi> Chriſt took three of his Diſciples up into the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figuration; this was a great favour, for it was the glimpſe of glory. Now he did this to them, and not to other of the Diſciples: Chriſt hath ſome ſpecial favours which he will diſpenſe as he pleaſeth; for as the fountain heedeth not the ſtream, nor the ſun its beam, but they are wholly from them; thus God needeth not the graces, the gifts, the enlargements of iſtruments; but many times (as the Apoſtle in another caſe) puts the greateſt glory upon the moſt uncomely parts.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>A Miniſtry following Gods Counſel, may yet finde no ſucceſſe, becauſe of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">A reaſon from the people.</note> 
                     <hi>the froward, and indispoſed temper of the people.</hi> Thus Chriſt weeps over Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem; <hi>How often would I have gathered thee, and thou wouldst not?</hi> Thus the Word alſo did not profit the Iſraelites, becauſe it was not mingled with Faith: and if our Goſpel be hid (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>It is to thoſe that periſh, whoſe eyes the God of this world hath blinded,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 3. O words worthy of all obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If it be hid, that is, if men do not underſtand it, do not feel the power of it, it is becauſe thou art one to periſh, one to be damned: It is becauſe the Divel hath ſhut thine eyes. Oh then lay the fault where it is: Thou art apt to to blame the Miniſtry, to cavil at him, or to blame his preaching. But ſee what the Apoſtle ſaith, If our Goſpel, if our preaching be hid to you, it is becauſe you are to periſh: For as the husbandman, though he ſhould be never ſo laborious in ploughing, ſowing, and fitting the ground; though he be never ſo careful to provide precious and choyce ſeed, yet if the nature of the ground be ſo barren, as it will bear no ſeed, or cauſe it to degenerate into Cockle, all the labour is in vain: Or as the Gardener, though he water and dreſſe never ſo carefully, yet if the tree be dead at the root, it is all to no purpoſe: So though the Miniſters of God are very earneſt in praying, preaching, informing, rebuking, yet where the Tree is dead at the root, What hope is there!</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond grand quaere may be, Whether a corrupt Miniſtry that neglects the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Whether a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Miniſtry may be the means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</note> 
                     <hi>counſel of God, may not yet be a means of Converſion?</hi> Whether an ungodly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry may not be uſed by God to convert others? This was a queſtion diſcuſſed of old, between the Orthodox, and the Donatiſts; for the Donatiſts thought, that if any Miniſter fell into groſſe ſinnes, neither the preaching of the word, nor his adminiſtration of Sacraments could do any good to others; for how, ſaid they, can death be a means to beget life? How can darkneſſe produce light? How can a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Divel make a Member of Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>To anſwer this caſe, Firſt, <hi>We muſt diſtinguiſh of the corruption of a Miniſter:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> For either it is Doctrinal, in reſpect of that matter which he preacheth; or elſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical in regard of his life and Converſation: if the Corruption be Doctrinal, then it is either totall, or partial: Total, when he doth wholly forſake the Truth, and preach nothing but damnable Hereſies, and the vain lies and imaginations of his heart: and he that is thus corrupted univerſally, can never convert others: The reaſon is, becauſe the word and Truth of God is that immortal ſeed, by which we are begotten: <hi>Sanctifie them by thy truth, thy word is truth,</hi> John 17. So that Divine truths are the only inſtrument of life ſpiritual, as good food and not poyſon is of natural; but if it be onely partiall, not in fundamentals, but ſuperſtitious additions; that miniſtry in ſome reſpects may be profitable: and hereupon our Saviour bid them hear the Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>While thy ſate in Moſes chair,</hi> i. e. as long as they preached the Doctrine of <hi>Moſes,</hi> but then thoſe that live under ſuch a corrupt Miniſtry, had need be very judicious to diſtinguiſh between good and bad, There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Saviour, who allowed the people to hear the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees,
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:30767:278"/>
did alſo at the ſame time bid them take heed, and beware of their Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>But in the next place, ſuppoſe they be Orthodox, and ſound in their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <note place="margin">Whether a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane miniſter may convert any.</note> 
                     <hi>yet ungodly and prophane in their lives, Can we think God will honour ſuch? Can ſalt if it hath loſt his ſavour ſeaſon others?</hi> Can light, not put under a Buſhell, but under a noyſome dunghill, Can that enlighten others? Yet ſuch unſavourie ſalt, ſuch obſcured light is every prophane Miniſter. To Anſwer this, Conſider,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That if that <hi>Holy and good diſcipline which Chriſt hath appointed in his Church were obſerved, no ſuch ungodly Miniſters were to be endured in publick of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Hence <hi>Paul</hi> commands <hi>Timothy,</hi> That he ordaine no man a Miniſter that is of an ungodly and prophane life; and certainly if Chriſt would have every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular perſon, that is an obſtinate wicked perſon, caſt out of the Church, how much rather an ungodly officer in the Church?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Yet ſuppoſe that a corrupt Miniſter is continued for want of good Diſcipline, it cannot be denied but an ungodly life <hi>is a great occaſion to pull down as much as the word builds up.</hi> Examples do work more then precepts. The lives of Spiritual Shepheards are like thoſe rods <hi>Iacob</hi> laid in the way for the ſheep to look on, that they might bring ſuch coloured lambs; and therefore if ever they are inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to convert others, it is a ſtrange, a rare and wonderfull thing. Hence in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi> thoſe that convert others to righteouſneſſe, are ſaid <hi>to ſhine like the ſtars in the firmament,</hi> Dan. 12. 3. which wicked men cannot do.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>But for all this we cannot ſay abſolutely and univerſally, That no ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miniſter is uſed at any time an instrument to convert others, no more then their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe may hinder the good effect of the Sacraments they adminiſter,</hi> for theſe two reaſons. Firſt of Example in Scripture, That makes no diſtinction between <hi>Judas</hi> and the other Diſciples in the ſucceſſe of the Miniſtry; <hi>They all twelve were ſent out,</hi> they all did miracles, they all caſted out Divels, they all returned to Chriſt and gave him an account of their ſucceſſe. To them all Chriſt ſaid, <hi>He had ordained that they ſhould go out,</hi> viz. in their preaching, <hi>and bear much fruit,</hi> viz. in their Miniſtry, <hi>John</hi> 15. 16. And our Saviour expreſly ſaith of ſome, <hi>That they ſhould propheſie in his name, yet he would bid them depart, becauſe workers of iniquity:</hi> and <hi>Phil. 3. There were falſe Apoſtles who preached Chriſt out of envy,</hi> ſuppoſing to adde more afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and perſecution to <hi>Paul,</hi> which muſt needs be an high degree of wickedneſs and malice, yet <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>He rejoyced that Chriſt was preached howſoever,</hi> which could not be if their preaching did no good. Although indeed to theſe examples of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aas,</hi> and the falſe Apoſtles, it may be anſwered, That they were not at that time groſſe and ſcandalous ſinners for ought can appear, but unregenerate and ſpiritually wicked, not corporally.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They may be uſed by God for converſion, becauſe the Miniſtry is <hi>gratia gratis data,</hi> not <hi>gratia gratum faciens;</hi> It is appointed for the publick good of others, not for the Miniſters good ſo much; and therefore God may work that end of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good, though the inſtrument be ſinful: As ſaith <hi>Auſtin, The ſeed that is ſown by a foul diſeaſed hand, may bring forth fruit as well as that which is ſown by a clean hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe of Admonition,</hi> take heed that the Word of God have no effect upon thee becauſe of thy ſins. Oh how terrible will it be when it ſhall appear, God hath done for thy converſion what a gracious God might do; The Miniſter hath done what a faithful Miniſter ſhould do, but thou haſt not done what a good hearer ſhould do: What is that? 1. Thou art not ſwift to hear, thou art careleſſe, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, thou doſt not diligently wait on the gates of wiſdom, as ſick men do at the Phyſitians doors. 2. Thou doſt not lay aſide all ſuperfluity of naughtineſſe, as the ſame Text requireth; and ſo the word is like rain falling on dirty ground that makes it more dirty. 3. Thou doſt not retain it and hide it in thy heart as <hi>David,</hi> thou doſt not cover it with warmth, as the fowl doth her eggs; thou art but almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to leave thyſins.</p>

Thus <hi>Pſalm</hi> 33. 15. an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Pſalm</hi> againſt Atheiſm, wherein the Pſalmiſt giveth ſeveral arguments to prove the providence of God, that things are not carried in this world, as mens luſts and counſels would have it, but as God orders it, either in mercy or juſtice: This, I ſay, the Pſalmiſt would have men believe; for when we ſee things done in the world, contrary to that we judge righteouſneſs, and yet no judgements immediately following, we are ready to be tempted about our faith. As <hi>Pompey,</hi> when he was overcome by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> fled to <hi>Athens,</hi> and there diſputed there was no providence, becauſe he thought he was deſerted in a juſt cauſe: But this is to be ignorant of God, and not to be able to plough with his heifer, to underſtand the Scripture, by which all thoſe Divine Riddles may be opened. Now among other arguments, he brings one that confirms my Doctrine, <hi>He faſhoneth their heart alike:</hi> The Argument is this, He that makes the heart know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every thing in the heart, and can make it think, will and love, as he pleaſeth. As the Artificer that makes a clock, he knoweth all things about the clock, and makes it ſtrike when and where he pleaſeth: And the words are Emphatical, <hi>He faſhioneth;</hi> the ſame word is uſed of Gods faſhioning mans body out of the duſt at firſt: So that God can as eaſily form and faſhion the ſouls of men, as he can their bodies; he can as eaſily ſtrike them with fear, as the body with diſeaſes. Again, <hi>He faſhioneth them alike;</hi> in the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>Simul;</hi> that is, as ſome expound, all mens hearts, there is not one mans excepted; or elſe as others, totally and wholly, there is nothing can ariſe in the heart, not the leaſt thought, or the leaſt motion, but it comes by Gods providence. Hence <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 1. the Kings heart is ſaid to be in the hand of the Lord: A Kings heart, the greateſt of men, and whoſe counſels and purpoſes ſeem to be moſt hidden, and moſt potent to be effected; And <hi>its in the hand of the Lord:</hi> A notable expreſſion, to ſhew how eaſily he can govern and turn as he pleaſeth; and then he uſeth an excellent ſimilitude, <hi>He turneth it as the Rivers of waters:</hi> That as a ſtream of water running down the torrent, can eaſily by the husbandman be ſtopt and turned down another courſe, either to refreſh his ground, or annoy it: Thus the Lord turneth the hearts of thoſe that rule in the world, either for mercy or

judgement, as he pleaſeth. Now the better to clear this truth, we will am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifie this Soveraign Dominion of God over mens hearts, in three particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: <note place="margin">Gods domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over mens hearts is ſeen.</note> 1. <hi>As in the way of his general Providence. 2. In the way of his Justice 3. In the way of his Grace:</hi> And in all theſe three particulars God is admirable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the way of his Providence, his power over hearts is manifeſted:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>In a ſuddain changing and raiſing up of their hearts by his mighty work for ſuch imployments, that they were no ways able for before:</hi> That which <note place="margin">1. In the way of his providence.</note> all the men in the world could not give; That which all the Angels in heaven could not, that God doth immediately. Thus <hi>Saul,</hi> when he was appointed to be King over <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he was of the meaneſt Tribe, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Family in the Tribe, an ordinary man; and yet it is ſaid, <hi>God gave him another heart;</hi> and when he had that, with what courage and boldneſs did he take the Government upon him: That other ſpirit, was not a ſpirit of Grace and Godlineſs, as the <hi>Arminians</hi> would have it, but of Government, and Political Abilities; in token whereof, <hi>Samuel</hi> at the Sacrifice, gave him a ſhoulder of it; to ſhew the Government upon his ſhoulders, and how he muſt bear the people: And as this was wonderful for God to make ſuch a change in him, ſo on the people alſo to receive him for their King: <hi>All thoſe followed him, whoſe hearts God had touched,</hi> ſaith the Text, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 26. God did but touch their hearts, as the Muſician doth the ſtrings of his inſtrument, and they ſound what he would have them: Such a ſpirit of Government, thoſe ſeventy Elders had, that were to aſſiſt <hi>Moſes;</hi> God took of <hi>Moſes</hi> his ſpirit, and beſtowed on them: Thus the Judges that God raiſed up in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they were in ſo many extremities, eſpecially <hi>Joſhua,</hi> whom ſome ſay, was the Heathens <hi>Hercules:</hi> Theſe all felt the mighty work of God upon their hearts.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Gods power over mens hearts in a general way, is ſeen, <hi>In the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>abating and aſſwaging thoſe fierce affections, and angry reſolutions that men have one againſt another:</hi> God in a moment can command thoſe waves and winds to be ſtill. We have two famous examples for this; the former, in <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> what reſolved malitious intentions were in <hi>Eſau,</hi> after the mourning for his father was over to kill <hi>Jacob?</hi> and now there was a full opportunity put into his hand; <hi>Jacob</hi> had no power to withſtand him, and of a ſudden <hi>Eſaus</hi> affections are wholly changed to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 33. 20. How cometh this black cloud to blow away ſo immediately? was it not becauſe God wrought, and moved upon his heart. The latter inſtance, is of <hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> he goeth out alſo in a great fury againſt <hi>Jacob;</hi> but what ſaith God to him? <hi>See thou doeſt not ſpeak any word to Jacob,</hi> Gen. 31. 24. and this preſently ſoftned his heart: We might adde to this, the meltings of <hi>Sauls</hi> heart towards <hi>David</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, when otherways he was full of poyſon and venom: Thus alſo <hi>Joſeph</hi> found favor in the eyes of <hi>Pharaoh:</hi> And a notable inſtance there is, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 18. 31. where the Army of the <hi>Syrians</hi> ſurprizing <hi>Iehoſhaphat,</hi> and thinking to deſtroy him, he cryed out, and God helped him; But how? the Text ſaith, <hi>God moved them to depart from him.</hi> So that we ſee, all our applications ſhould be to God. Men have not their hearts in their own power; men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think hurt to thee, yea, they cannot but think and purpoſe good to thee, wherefore God moves the hearts of men thereto: Thus he ſaith to theſe waves, Hitherto thou ſhalt go, and no further; he bindes up theſe clouds in the air.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Gods Providential working on mens hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>s, is ſeen in the inclination</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>and determination of them</hi> (when they are indifferent in themſelves) to ſuch ways, as whereby he will bring honor and glory to himſelf: In nothing under the heavens is Gods Soveraignity ſo much ſeen, as here: For the hearts of men, are thoſe great inſtruments, by which he produceth ſo many notable ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects in the world: <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> is remarkable herein; the Prophet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:30767:280"/>
him as ſtanding at two ways, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 21. 21, 22. either to fight againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or another Nation: Now it was all one to him, which way he went, yet God ſo ordered, that he ſhould go againſt them. Thus as God is ſaid to ponder and weigh mens hearts in one ſenſe; ſo in this ſenſe alſo, he layeth mens hearts in a ballance, and they eaſily incline this way or that way, and God he puts in ſomething that inclineth their hearts rather this way then that way. Hence the great Monarchs of the world, the <hi>Babylouian</hi> and <hi>Perſian,</hi> they are compared to Hatchets, to Hammers, to Bees, over which God hath a command. The whole world is his Hoſt, and God is the Emperor or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; and he bids this go, and he goeth, that come, and he cometh; as the Centurion did his men under him: What a wonderful work was that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Cyrus</hi> his heart, and his Succeſſors, to let the Jews build their Temple un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God again; yea, what a ſtrange paſſage was that of good to <hi>Mordechai,</hi> when the King could not ſleep, that he ſhould call for a Book to read, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then for ſports or pleaſures; and that of all Books, the Hiſtory or Chronicles of memorable things done in the Kingdome; and in that Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he ſhould pitch on the good ſervice <hi>Mordechai</hi> had done, and was not rewarded. Its remarkable alſo, that when God intended to puniſh <hi>Abimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech</hi> and the <hi>Sechemites, Iudges</hi> 9. its ſaid, <hi>God ſent an evill ſpirit between them,</hi> and that was their ruine at laſt: Oh then how much is this God to be feared, to be obeyed, who doth in Heaven and Earth what he wills! Its not as Great men, as Mighty men, as Wiſe men will; but the counſel of the Lord that ſhall ſtand.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, God in the Old Teſtament had a notable way of bringing about the hearts of men for his great and mighty works by <hi>Dreams.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are three kindes of Dreams, Natural, Diabolical, by way of delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: or Supernatural, immediately raiſed in men by God. In ſuch a way God <note place="margin">Of Dreams.</note> formerly did inform men ſometimes: Thus <hi>Iacob</hi> laying his head on a ſtone, had a dream; and <hi>Ioſeph</hi> a dream about his Superiority over his Brethren, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48. 12. yea, <hi>Pilates</hi> wife had a dream, which ſhe told <hi>Pilate,</hi> that he ſhould have nothing to do with that juſt man, to ſhed his innocent blood, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27. 19. But that is diſputed, whether the Devil did not put that dream into her, becauſe he would not have Chriſt crucified, knowing that by Chriſts death, his Kingdom would be diſſolved; But how doth that agree with Satans entring into <hi>Iudas</hi> heart, tempting him to betray his Maſter. There were two great Kings, and Heathens, ſuch as had no knowledge of God, and yet God did viſit them by dreams, of things to come; as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> by ſeven years of barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſeven of fruitfulneſs; <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> of the change of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the mighty alienation of it in time: But theſe did not underſtand them, till <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> revealed the myſtery to them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In the next place, <hi>Gods power over the hearts of men, in a way of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">II. In the way of his Juſtice. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Iuſtice, is alſo admirable:</hi> And that in two reſpects:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>In infatuating the counſels and thoughts of wiſe men:</hi> He ſtrikes the great ones of the world, when he is angry, with the ſpirit of madneſs and gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 24. 45. Thus <hi>David</hi> prayed, That God would turn <hi>Achitophels</hi> coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel into folly, onely God could do it: And the Princes of <hi>Zoan</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> that thought they were wiſe, and none like them, God ſtroke them with folly and giddineſs: So true is that old obſervation, <hi>Quos Deus vult perdere, prius dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentat,</hi> When God intends to deſtroy and ruine man, he firſt beginneth with their underſtanding, inflicting giddineſs upon that: The eyes of a man firſt dye, theu ſay, and ſo men periſh firſt in their counſels, thoughts and deſigns, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in other things: Thus God is ſaid <hi>To catch the crafty in their own wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and he knoweth that the thoughts of the wiſe they are vain,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Gods Iuſtice upon mens hearts is, in the ſpiritual blinding and harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>of them:</hi> Thus God is ſaid to harden <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart; and <hi>Elys</hi> ſons would
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:30767:280"/>
not heaken to good counſel, becauſe it was of the Lord to deſtroy them: <hi>Whom he will, he hardens,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. But this is a tender point, Divines are large about it; onely know, that God doth not infuſe hardneſs of heart, nor any evil diſpoſition in men, for he cannot be the author of that of which he is the Avenger; but it is by withdrawing and denying his mollifying Grace: And then as the withdrawing of fire from the water, makes it preſently cold, and return to its native temperament; ſo it is here, God forſaking the heart by denying his mollifying and ſoftning oparations, it cannot but grow ſtiff and obdurate againſt God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In the laſt place, <hi>Let us view the glorious power of God, over the hearts of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">III. In the way of his Grace.</note> 
                     <hi>men in a gracious way;</hi> and that is properly intended in the Text: <hi>I will give an heart of fleſh.</hi> Now Gods work on the heart, when he changeth it, in theſe particulars:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>He convinceth and enlightens the minde with ſuch a glorious light, that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                     <hi>the perſon converted ſtands amazed at it: That we ſhould ſhew forth his praiſe who hath tranſlated us out of darkneſs, into his marvellous light,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9 <hi>And you that were darkneſs, are now made light,</hi> Epheſ. 4. This is the ſeeing eye that God vouchſafeth to ſome men: Now then, if to reſtore eyes to the blinde, was ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful a work, how wonderful is it to give a man new light? God gives a man new abilities to ſee; he doth not onely bring the object, and the medium, but the ability alſo; and till this be done, its impoſſible men ſhould ever love or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire what is good: Oh look up then to this! you are apt to be wiſe in your own eyes, you are apt to ſay, as the Phariſees did, We ſee: But pray earneſtly to God for this ſpirit of illumination; thou wilt then finde as much difference in thy ſelf, as one in a dark cloſe dungeon; and another, that is come out into the open Sun-ſhine.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Gods work on the heart, is to raiſe up ſuch affections as may make the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>yoke of Chriſt eaſie:</hi> That may make thee with delight and joy, to imbrace what is good: for here is the great obſtruction againſt converſion, men have carnal and earthly hearts, they delight in what is evil, they imbrace the dunghill, they love the mire, like ſwine. hence all heavenly and ſpiritual objects are grievous and burthenſom to them: Now then God he can turn this clod of earth, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſtar in the sky; he can change this heavy lumpiſh temper, into a gracious ſpiritual diſpoſition: And when he doth thus, then what was once tedious and grievous, now becomes pleaſant and joyful.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>He doth make the heart tender and melting:</hi> And this is the great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy <note place="margin">3.</note> here promiſed: for naturally the heart is a ſtone in ſpiritual things; it hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o apprehenſion, no joy, no ſenſe; lay all the wrath of God before it, and you cannot move it, you cannot make it mourn and grieve; but when God puts forth this power, then a dry wilderneſs is turned into a pool of water; then the mountains melt like wax before him; then rocks are turned into ſtreams of water: O then admire, and pray for this mighty work of God! doeſt thou complain thy heart is like the neather milſtone? Oh it will not melt, it will not change, it will not yield to God! go to this heart maker, and he will be an heart breaker.</p>
                  <p>Fouthly, <hi>That which is the moſt admirable operation upon the heart, is the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>and bending of it, ſo as to make it of unwilling willing:</hi> Thus this expreſſion of the Text, <hi>I will give an heart of fleſh,</hi> doth denote the efficacy and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timateneſs of his power; and ſo the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God worketh in us to will;</hi> and in this very point, upon this hinge hangs that great and ſpecial truth, which the Orthodox maintain againſt <hi>Arminians</hi> and Papiſts: They will grant an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtable work of light upon the underſtanding, they will grant a potent work upon the affections, but this they will not yield, that God makes the will to will, that he ſo boweth and changeth the heart, that it readily imbraceth, what once it abhorred; yet in all that are converted, this power ſo efficacious, muſt
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:30767:281"/>
be needs put forth; for will not experience witneſs, that every mans will, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore converting grace came, was as oppoſite to God, as averſe to all holineſs, as any natural mans in the world? did he not diſpute, argue, refuſe, and ſhew all unwillingneſs, till God broke open the gate of the ſoul; he comes into the heart while the doors of it are ſhut: Thus he is ſaid to open the heart of <hi>Lydia, Acts</hi> 16. and <hi>Paul,</hi> was he willing to receive Chriſt? did not he oppoſe, perſecute and violently purſue the Church of God; and while he was in theſe furious out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, did not God in a moment bow his heart, that he cryeth out, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do:</hi> But of this more in the manner of Gods converſion.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>The ſoveraignty of Gods power, is to be adored, that he can comfort the</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>heart with heavenly joy, or wound it with ſad and heavy temptations and deſertions when he pleaſeth!</hi> Our hearts are calm and tempeſtuous, even as he ſpeaks the word, <hi>Job</hi> 34. 29. who can give trouble, if he ſpeak quietneſs, whether to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or a nation. God ſtruck the heart of great <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> and made him like a beaſt; and he can ſtrike the heart of a wicked man, and make him roar like one damned in hell: Thus we ſee <hi>David</hi> ſometimes complaineth of the great terrors that he was even diſtracted with; and at another time, his heart over-floweth with joy: This ebbing and flowing is according to the preſence or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Gods favor.</p>
                  <p>This point is worthy of all practical improvement: And <note place="margin">Uſe. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>It ſheweth what poor, weak and empty ſhadows all the great, wiſe, powerful and mighty men of the world are:</hi> They are not the maſters of their own hearts, they cannot tell what they ſhall think, what they ſhall purpoſe, much leſs, do, the next day. Well doth the Pſalmiſt ſay, <hi>They are lighter then duſt orvanity:</hi> What a folly then is it to put confidence in ſuch, to truſt in any arm of fleſh: You ſee a ſhadow is not able to move it ſelf, but is this way or that way, as the body ſtirreth; ſo is all earthly and humane power: God uſeth theſe Rods, theſe Axes, which way he pleaſeth: Oh then ſay, nothing is great but God, hope in nothing, truſt in nothing but in God. An hill or an high mountain may be ſomething, if compared with the low valleys; but if with the heavens its but a pins point: So earthly power and greatneſs, may be a terrible thing to thoſe that are weaker. Gyants are tall things to Graſhoppers, but compare them with God, and they are nothing, yea leſs then nothing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 2, Is God thus powerful over the heart, then let the godly be comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> who finde their hearts too ſtrong for them; O their proud heart, their hard heart, their unbelieving heart, their earthly heart, what ſhall they do? Its true, ſhouldſt thou pray the Potentates of the world, yea the Angels of heaven, to give thee a better heart, they could do nothing: O but God he is gracions, ready, willing and able.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Of terror to wicked men, how eaſily can he raiſe terrors and horrors <note place="margin">Uſe 3.</note> in that jolly heart of thine: If <hi>Iudas</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> would have given all the world for a quiet heart, they could not have purchaſed it: Do not then preſume too long; do not ſtill venture to offend him; he can ſend thee home with a roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reſtleſs heart, he can make thee cry out, There is no help for me, O for a drop of eaſe.</p>

                  <p>THe ſecond thing obſerved in this <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> or grand promiſe of converſion is, the good it ſelf ſpoken of, which is deſcribed, 1. Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, or by removing the oppoſite. 2. Poſitively. Let us conſider what is that grand obſtruction which muſt be taken away, ere we can have an heart of fleſh; and that is the heart of ſtone muſt be removed. The word <hi>ſtone</hi> when it is uſed Tropically in the Scripture, it is ſometimes taken in a good ſenſe, and ſometimes in a bad ſenſe: In a good ſenſe, for that which is firm and induring; thus Chriſt is called <hi>a foundation ſtone,</hi> Iſa. 28. 16. and Believers <hi>living ſtones, 1 Pet.</hi> 2. 5. becauſe of their ſolid and firm compacting and union with Chriſt. In which ſenſe <hi>Bonaventure</hi> ſaid the clean contrary to this promiſe, <hi>Nolo Domine cor carneum, da lapideum,</hi> O Lord, I will not have an heart of fleſh, that is, flexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and eaſily drawn any way; but a ſtony heart, that is firm and induring in good againſt all oppoſition whatſoever. But in this place the word ſtone is uſed in an ill ſenſe, for a ſenſeleſs, ſtupid and rebellious heart againſt Gods word. As the ſtone in the fire will ſooner fly in the face of him that ſits by, then melt. So the heart of every man by nature will ſooner oppoſe, gainſay, and rage at thoſe who reprove or inſtruct then melt, or yield obedience: Whereas, <hi>Ier.</hi> 23.

                     <hi>That every man naturally in reſpect of any divine or ſpiritual good, hath a very</hi>

                  <p>The diſeaſe of the ſtone in the body is an exquiſite and unexpreſſible torment, how much would men give to be eaſed of it. But this ſtone in the heart, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are wholly ſenſeleſs and ſtupid about heavenly things, moved neither with love or fear, or grief, is above all this torment, if men did rightly judge of it. It was the Poets fiction, that men were made of ſtones, <hi>Inde genus durum ſumus:</hi> to be ſure, there is this ſpirituall ſtone on the heart; whereby we are an hard, tough, rugged, and untractable people; inſomuch that whereſoever God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts men by the Miniſtry, there he raiſeth up children to <hi>Abraham</hi> out of ſtones, there he makes water to guſh out of rocks, there he makes dry bones to gather together and live. To amplifie this, let us conſider how much wickedneſſe this <note place="margin">How much wickedneſſe is implied in this Epithete, <hi>Stony heart.</hi> 1.</note> Epithete <hi>(stony)</hi> doth imply to be in every man naturally.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, <hi>It denoteth ſenſeleſneſſe and ſtupidity;</hi> for ſo commonly we expreſſe that by a ſtone. We ſay of a ſenſeleſs, irrational man, As good ſpeak to a ſtone. Thus <hi>Nabals</hi> heart is ſaid to be dead within him, and become like a ſtone, he was aſtoniſhed and amazed through the danger coming upon him, he was made ſtupid, and apprehended nothing. The Scripture delights by way of contempt to call the Heathen Idols, wood and ſtones, becauſe they had eies and ſaw not, feet and
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:30767:282"/>
walked not: Juſt ſuch ſtocks and ſtones are all men by nature; they have cors and hear not, they have hearts and underſtand not. That whereas the Prophet cryed to that inſenſible Altar of ſtones, <hi>O Altar, Altar,</hi> 1 King. 13. 2. and preſently it rent aſunder, here the Miniſters of God may cry aloud, and no man is ſenſible of his ſin, or crieth out, <hi>What have I done?</hi> Oh then pray that God would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move that heavy ſtone, which lieth upon thy heart, that under all preaching and teaching makes thee ſtill ſo inſenſible, that Miniſtry or no Miniſtry, judgements or no judgements are all one to thee. Do not then be any longer like the ſtones in the wall, who know nothing, underſtand nothing, though they are built in the wals of the Church where much preaching is. Some derive <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> the people, from a ſtone, I know for other reaſons, but we may ſay, becauſe of the ſtony heart, and inſenſibleneſs that is in them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It implieth incapacity and indispoſedneſs unto any thing that is holy.</hi> As they are not ſenſible, ſo much leſs prepared and fitted for any ſpiritual duty. <note place="margin">2.</note> The building of the material Temple was a type of believers. Now as the ſtone could not poliſh and fit it ſelf for the Temple, ſo neither have we any power in our ſelves to take away the leaſt enmity that is againſt God. Inſomuch that this text doth triumph over all thoſe corrupt doctrines that advance free-will, and power in man to ſpiritual things. What, can a ſtone make it ſelf to live? Can <hi>Ezekiels</hi> dry bones produce life of themſelves? Could the bone taken out of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi> ſide, make it ſelf a living woman? Its true, man hath reaſon, underſtanding and a will, and ſo in that ſenſe he is not a ſtone; but he hath no reaſon to think what is good, no will to chooſe what is good, and ſo in that reſpect is like a ſtone. And hence it is. that we need not wonder, if men of great parts and wiſdom are yet ſo fooliſh and void of all love and delight in what is good, for a man may be very quick and apprehenſive in all matters of learning and humane perfections, and yet be a very ſtone about what is godly. <hi>Nicodemus</hi> had great underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the law of God, yet how unfit for that doctrine about Regeneration!</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The ſtonineſs of the heart doth imply, not only indiſpoſition, <hi>but active contrariety and reſiſtency to what is holy.</hi> Thus the Jews are called a people of a <note place="margin">3.</note> ſtiff neck, that is the ſame with a ſtony heart, <hi>Act. 7. Ye have alwaies reſiſted the holy Ghoſt,</hi>

                     </gap>, you fall like an heavy ſtone with violence upon the word of God, and all divine exhortations. The ſtone is not only indiſpoſed for poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but as much as lieth in it, doth reſiſt, and beat back again the hammer that fals upon it. Oh this active enmity and vigorous oppoſition which is in all men by nature, to that which is holy, is much to be lamented. The Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. ſpeaks of this enmity of the fleſh, which doth ſo far prevail, that it makes a man not only not ſubject, but it cannot be ſubject to the law of God, for theſe two are contrary, the ſpiritual law and the carnal heart, and ſo as light and darkneſs, fire and water cannot accord, ſo neither can theſe. Marvell not then if ye ſee men, whoſe thoughts, purpoſes, affections, and all ineavours are againſt godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: Their hearts to conceive miſchief againſt it; their tongues to be alwaies railing or deriding of it: For can the toad vent hony? can the ſerpent ſpit cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dials? no more can theſe indure what is ſupernatural.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>This deſcribeth the hardneſs of the heart, and impenetrableneſs of it.</hi> Its a ſtone, and though the word be a two edged ſword, yet is it any wonder, if <note place="margin">4.</note> a ſword cannot pierce through an hard ſtone. The Scripture, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 18. ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of a threefold hardneſs, natural, acquired, by voluntary ſins againſt conſcience, and judicial, inflicted as a juſt judgement by God upon thoſe who have rebelled againſt the light; now this which we ſpeak of is the natural hardneſs, that which is in every man and woman. Take the moſt civil and ingenuous man, who is ſo tractable in all things of morality, yet he hath an hard heart to that which is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual. The doctrine of repentance, mortification, and powerfull walking with God, is that which can finde no entrance in him. Oh therefore that this ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual hardneſs were more apprehended; you can complain of hard times, of hard
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:30767:282"/>
dealings in the world. Oh what hard dealing hath God from thee! His judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have not broke thy heart, his mercies have not melted thy heart, Oh think if there were any ſoftneſs, if any drops in thee, if any meltings in thee, thou hadſt not to this day continued ſuch a rebellious wretch againſt God. <hi>Illud eſt cor du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, quod non trepidat ad nomen cordis duri;</hi> If thy ſoul doth not break, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and melt at the very preaching about a ſtony heart, its becauſe thou art over-whelmed by it. This hard heart is elſe where called an heart of adamant, which is as much as that, which cannot be turned: Oh this is thy caſe; nothing hath tamed thee, or humbled thee to this day.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, <hi>This word holds out the pertinacy and immoveableneſs of the heart from</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>the way of ſin.</hi> A great heavy ſtone lieth many years in the ſame place; and thus it is with every man naturally, how ſelf-willed, how unmoveable! you cannot ſtir him out of his former waies of impiety. Though he hear much, though he be intreated, reproved, and conſtantly warned over and over again, yet he is ſtill the ſame man he was. Thus as the godly are commended for their immoveable ſtate in godlineſs and in happineſs, they ſtand like <hi>Zion,</hi> which can never be moved; the ſame are they in a ſtate of wickedneſs and impiety. Oh then, how doth experience daily witneſs this pertinacy of mens hearts in adhering to wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. When they are ſo convinced, that they can ſay nothing for their ſins, they muſt needs confeſs its their duty to be other men; they cannot ſay one word for ſelf-juſtification, yet they will not move from their former courſe of impieties. What kinde of hearts we have, was typically repreſented by <hi>Moſes,</hi> when the law was commanded to be written in ſtones, for albeit one main reaſon was to preſerve the laws perpetually; as Heathen lawgivers have commanded their laws to be ingraven on braſſe, or cypreſſe trees, that will not putrifie: Yet the Apoſtle alludes to an Allegory, when he tels the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> they were <hi>his Epiſtle not written</hi> (2 Cor. 3. 3.) <hi>in tables of ſtone, but fleſhy tables of the heart.</hi> So that to have hearts of ſtone, is to be pertinacious, wilfull; ſay what you can, bring the Scripture never ſo plainly, demonſtrate and convince the haynouſneſs of ſin ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo clearly, yet nothing ſhall make any alteration in them; they will be wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe they will be.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, <hi>An heart of stone is an heart altogether cold, and deſtitute of any warmth</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>or heat of grace.</hi> A ſtone is nothing but hardened earth, and as ſiccity and frigidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are the two properties of that element, ſo are they of a ſtone. Hence, it was a miracle to bring water out of the rock: <hi>Citius e pumice aquam,</hi> is a Proverb. Stones have theſe two qualities, as the earth out of which they are generated, Siccity or drineſs, there is no moiſture, there is no waterineſs in them, and thus it is in every mans heart, a dry barren ſpirit, there is no juyce, no ſap of any grace. Therefore the Greek word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> hardneſs, and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, doth excellently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs this curſed temper, for that is properly the drineſs of any herb, when it is withered, its then good for nothing, all the juyce is out of it. And thus men by nature have not the leaſt dropping or melting of ſoul: And obſerve this, A man may have a very tender, juicy heart, as it were, about earthly things; Jet an husband, wife, or any earthly advantage be loſt, and rivers of water can guſh out of thine eies: They may be of a pitifull and tender complexion, and yet as dry and barren as a very ſtone about the ſins they have committed, and the iniquities they are guilty of. Indeed <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of a drought upon his ſoul, that it was like a parched wilderneſs. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42. 1. but that was in a gracious ſenſe, becauſe of the earneſt pantings and longings he had for the injoyment of Gods favour. But this is in a very wicked and deſperate ſenſe, when men have not the leaſt mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, or thawings of ſoul upon any divine adminiſtrations. The other property is frigidity, or coldneſs, As cold as a ſtone, we ſay; and thus every mans heart is deſtitute of all that fire and heat which doth uſually accompany the life of grace. Hence men are ſaid to be <hi>dead in ſins,</hi> Eph. 2. 4. death and coldneſs go together. The Spirit of God in its operations is compared to fire, becauſe of the efficacy and
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:30767:283"/>
fervency of it; now men deſtitute of this ſpirit, are wholly liveleſs; and cold in any thing that is good.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Seeing a ſtone is nothing but a product of the earth, it hath alſo the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the earth, which is heavineſs or gravity, an inclination to deſcend, to fall down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">7.</note> And this alſo is wonderfully ſeen in every mans diſpoſition by nature: His affections are wholly ſet upon earthly things, though he hath a body ſtreight up towards heaven, and ſo excelling other creatures, yet his ſoul is bowed down to the ground, ſo that in this ſenſe, as well as others, we may ſay, he is a worm and no man. The bodily curſe of the ſerpent, is ſpiritually fulfilled on him, To lick the duſt of the earth, and to make that his food; this is the heavy portion of every man by nature, to ſwallow down iniquity like water, to center upon earthly objects, as naturally as the ſtone fals downward; Wonder not then, if you ſee men wholly plunged in earthly affairs, they minde not, they regard not, they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand not heavenly things; for (alas) how can the earth aſcend upwards? how can a clod of clay move of it ſelf towards the skies? here muſt be a change of our natural properties, before theſe things can be done.</p>
                  <p>Having thus deſcribed the properties of this ſtony heart, and how much the word may purport. Let us now conſider <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ome effects or ſigns, which do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly <note place="margin">The effects which demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate all men by nature to have a heart of ſtone. 1.</note> diſcover, that men by nature have ſuch hearts of ſtones.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, <hi>What can be a greater evidence, then the ſecurity, quiet, and eaſe, which men naturally have, though thus obnoxious to guilt, and the wrath of God.</hi> Do but conſider what the word of God ſaith of every man by nature, how it aggravates his ſin and miſery, makes him every moment ready to fall into eternal torments, that all within him and without him is hated of God all the day long: Conſider all this and believe it. Now what a ſtone and ſtock is man, that for all this truth of God, thus informing, thus threatning, thus curſing, is no more troubled and affected about himſelf! Certainly were not men like <hi>Niobe,</hi> turned into very mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and ſtones, they could never be thus ſtupid, yea they would run up and down crying out, What ſhall we do to be changed? How may this ſtone, this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain be removed and thrown into a ſea of tears and ſorrow? Do ye then doubt, whether men be thus by nature ſo ſtupid and ſenſeleſs about divine things? What need ye go any further, ſee how they can eat, drink, rejoyce, and be ſecure, when yet ſo many woes are denounced againſt them: Oh then ſay, Lord give me a ſoft heart, give me a broken heart; yet Lord it is not broken, yet it is not broken. Oh let any judgement fall upon me rather then this hard heart. Oh let any affliction lye upon me rather then this heart of ſtone.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This ſtony ſenſeleſs heart is manifeſted, in that <hi>Though in the generall they commend holineſs and godlineſs, and ſo in the general deteſt and abhorre vice, yet</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>when it cometh to the particular, then they act and love that which they did in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral condemn.</hi> As now, Come to any prophane man wallowing in any groſſe ſin, and ask, Is it not an excellent, admirable thing, a life to be deſired, to live with the fear of God, to obey his law, to take heed of impiety, to walk religiouſly, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly and righteouſly? Oh without doubt they will ſay: and yet the ſame men live in direct oppoſite waies to this piety. Now if men were not ſtones and ſtocks; they could not but ſee their contradiction, they could not but ſee, how vainly they oppoſe their own ſelves; for if wickedneſs be to be abhorred, then thy wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, thoſe luſts thou liveſt in are to be loathed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That men have this heart of ſtone, appeareth, <hi>in that they conſider not the extream contrariety that is in their wicked lives to that holy profeſſion they take upon</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>them.</hi> Whoſoever is baptiſed into the name of Chriſt, and owneth his law, doth thereby ingage himſelf to live as Chriſt his Lord hath commanded. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> at large ſheweth the vanity and inſufficiency of ſuch a faith as doth not make a man give an univerſal obedience to what God commandeth: and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle cals upon us, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 27. that our converſation ſhould be as that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the Goſpel of Chriſt, to be ſheep and not ſwine. Now if men were not
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:30767:283"/>
meer idols, having eies and ſee not, hearts and perceive not, it were impoſſible they ſhould joyn an unholy life to an holy faith, an impure, prophane life, to ſo ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and pure a profeſſion. Canſt thou ſee or obſerve any thing, and doeſt thou not this? Why hath Chriſt called thee out of the world but to live in an unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted manner?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Herein we diſcover ſtony hearts, <hi>That neither the unexpreſſible wrath</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>of God revealed in the Scripture, nor the love of Chriſt, and the joyes of heaven promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, do work us ont of our ſins.</hi> Oh what can be a greater argument of our ſtupidity then either of theſe neglected? The wrath of God manifeſted in the word, how unſupportable is it! Is not hell deſcribed by every thing that is terrible, fire and brimſtone, chains of darkneſs, deſpairing horror; a death without death, crying for death and it cannot be had? ſo that the damned in hell can neither kill them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor others deſtroy them, and this torment to continue to all eternity, which is a perpetual woe, wherein there is no paſt or to come. That all this fury ſhould be made known to a ſinner, yet he to go on in his ſins deſperately venturing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, muſt you not cry out, Oh men, no men, but ſtones! And then on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, To conſider the love of God deſcribed in the Goſpel, to ſee Chriſt, God and man, made poor, miſerable, ignominious, lying under ſpiritual agonies, grapling with the infinite anger of God, and at laſt dying that curſed death for our ſakes, would not this make the very ſtones melt? and yet our hearts are not ſoftned by this love. The Temple clave aſunder, the very ſun was in a fainting eclipſe, as hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians ſay; and thy heart is not rent, nor doth thy ſpirit faint within thee. Beſides the joyes of heaven ſo full, pure and eternal, which are tendered to thee, if thou wilt forſake thy ſin; might not they be like the hot ſun beams that ariſe and melt the ice? but with man naturally all is in vain. Earthly comforts they are moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and deſired before the injoyment of them, and when injoyed they do not ſatisfie and ſo are leſs eſteemed; but heavenly joyes they are leſſe deſired and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved before injoyment; but when partaken of, the deſire will increaſe, and love ſhall then imbrace more then faith could believe, or hope deſire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> 1. Not to wonder if men after much preaching, yea after many judgements <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> and mercies, remain obdurate and immoveable in their wickedneſs. This text tels you the cauſe of all. They have hearts of ſtone, yea how many are worſe then ſtones, for <hi>gutta cavat lapidem;</hi> continual dropping will make impreſſion upon a very ſtone, and conſume it at laſt. But the word of God hath often diſtilled like a ſoft rain upon thee, and behold thou art not at all ſoftened, not one luſt is yet waſhed away. And ſtones upon the change of weather will ſtand on a dew, as if they were ſenſible of the alteration, but how many changes and alterations doth God make by his juſt judgements on ſinners, and thy heart is not affected? Oh then let this be thy daily praier, <hi>Lord I finde a load upon me, a mountain, an heavy ſtone upon me, I cannot pray for it, I cannot mourn for it: Lord whatſoever thou ſhalt deny me, deny not the removall of this.</hi>

                  <p>WE come in the third place to conſider the mercy, as it is poſitively ſet down, <hi>I will give an heart of fleſh.</hi> If fleſh were taken here properly for a maſſie part, then it could be no gracious promiſe, for every mans heart by nature is of fleſh; but fleſh is taken improperly or metaphorically; for when it is uſed in the Scripture improperly, it is either taken in a good ſenſe, or a bad ſenſe: In a bad ſenſe, it either denoteth fragility, miſery and vanity. Thus <hi>All fleſh is graſſe;</hi> and <hi>thine horſes are fleſh, not ſpirit.</hi> Or elſe ſinfulneſſe and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption: Thus, <hi>John 3.

It ſhould greatly humble us, that the Scripture cals ſin in us by ſuch names, for it argueth ſin to be innate, inbred in us, that we and ſin are all one as it were: as if we were not ſo much ſinners as ſin it ſelf; it cleaveth to us as the fleſh to the bones.

Thus, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. The hearts of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> which ſo readily received <hi>Pauls</hi> doctrine, are called <hi>fleſhy ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;</hi> and here it is uſed in this ſenſe in the text, <hi>I will give an heart of fleſh:</hi> We may juſtly admire the mighty work of God in making waters to guſh out of the rock, in touching mountains, ſo that they melt like wax; but above all, this mighty power of God, that makes hearts ſo ſtory and impenetrable, to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and capable for all duties.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That God in converſion doth make a mans heart tender and flexible for every duty he requireth.</hi>

His heart was like the ſtones they ſtoned <hi>Stephen</hi> with, and although he ſtoned not <hi>Stephen</hi> with his own hands, yet he was conſenting to it, and kept their gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, inſomuch that <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>Omnium lapidantium manibus lapidavit,</hi> he ſtoned him with the hands of all them that threw ſtones at him. He that compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the diſciples to blaſpheme, and was mad againſt them, ſee how in a moment his ſtony heart is taken away, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Oh tender heart, now he is willing to do and ſuffer any thing! Thus God whereſoever he vouchſafeth this converting grace, of an obdurate, averſe ſtony heart, he makes tender and pliable.</p>
                  <p>To open this, let us conſider firſt, <hi>What is implyed in this heart of fleſh;</hi> for that <note place="margin">What is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>Heart of fleſh.</hi> 1.</note> comprehends ſeveral gracious qualities: And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>A tender melting heart</hi> is principally intended. The heart of ſtone will neither yeeld to threatnings, or be ſoftened by mercies; but the fleſhy heart, that is tender under both. Thus <hi>Joſiah</hi> is commended for his tender, melting heart, while the threatnings of the law were read, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 27. and certainly thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of people diſcover, this promiſe was never effectual to them; for how ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate and wilfull are they againſt the word of God! they rage and roar like bears and tigers with vexation, rather then tenderly be ſoftened about the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion. Oh then conſider, how tender thy ſpirit is about Gods com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, doth it preſently thaw? is it immediatly ſoftened when Gods word comes to thee? this is a good ſign. I know the people of God do much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain their hearts are not ſo tender and ſoftened as they deſire: They complain they are very ſtocks and ſtones ſometimes; as the Church, <hi>Why haſt thou harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our hearts from thy fear,</hi> Iſa. 63. 17. But yet becauſe they feel this ſtonineſs, and they can tenderly bewail this, therefore it's a plain argument the work of grace is in their ſouls, though it be imperfect, and ſo it is not to be expected that all ſtonineſſe ſhould be removed out of the heart in this life. <hi>Contra vitia pugnamus non ut penitus vincamus, ſed ne vincamur,</hi> Seneca.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, From this tender ſoftneſſe of heart floweth <hi>A quick ſenſibleneſſe,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>and a lively apprehenſion of any ſpiritual thing that concerneth it.</hi> The tender skin doth preſently feel the leaſt offence, whereas that which is brawny and rugged is not ſo ſenſible. Thus it is in the true convert, he is very ſenſible, he is quick in underſtanding, as the Scripture expreſſeth it. And this ſenſibleneſſe is diſcerned in ſeveral particulars; as firſt, <hi>he can diſcern between things that differ,</hi> Heb. 6. <hi>He hath ſenſes exerciſed, to diſcern between good and evil.</hi> He is compared to an Eagle, his eye will quickly diſcern afar off. He is the ſpiritual man that judgeth all things; ſo that the true convert is not eaſily ſeduced by errors and falſe doctrines, for he hath a tender ſenſible heart: he is not eaſily inticed by Satan to ſinfull luſts, for he is preſently ſenſible. So ſecondly, his tenderneſſe appears, in that the leaſt ſins, the very motions, the very inclinations are an heavy burden unto him: Thus <hi>Hezekiah</hi> humbled himſelf for the pride of his heart, 2 <hi>Chron. 32. 26. David</hi> when he numbered the people, though the act it ſelf were lawfull, yet becauſe he did not keep Gods order, he did it out of vain glory, and Gods anger broke out becauſe of it: See how tenderly be is affected, <hi>Let thy anger be upon me and my fathers houſe, What have theſe ſheep done?</hi> When he cut off the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>his heart ſmote him. Paul,</hi> how ſadly and miſerably doth he cry out of the inward luſts of ſin within him! Thus the fleſhy heart is ſo tender, that it feels the very weight of a mote, as well as of a beam.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The ſenſibleneſſe of it is diſcovered, in that <hi>When he repents of ſin, he</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>is much affected becauſe of the unkindneſſe that is in ſin againſt God. Against thee, this only have I ſinned,</hi> Pſal. 51. Theſe <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſhould loath and abhorre them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves when God was pacified towards them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 63. This fleſhy heart is ſo ſenſible of the ill requitall that is in all ſin, for God his favour and love to them, that this affects them abundantly.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, This fleſhy heart implies <hi>Tractableneſſe and docibleneſſe in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note>
                     <pb n="518" facs="tcp:30767:285"/>
                     <hi>and flexibility in the will.</hi> Tractableneſſe in the underſtanding, that whereas a man naturally ſhuts his eyes againſt the light, he will not hear or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, but is froward, cavilling and alwaies diſputing againſt the things of his everlaſting peace; now he hath obtained that religion which the Apoſtle calls <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>eaſily to be perſwaded.</hi> This is one great corruption in man, that his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding exalteth it ſelf againſt the word, and he hath many carnall cavils and and prejudices againſt grace: now when God worketh on the heart, the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding is captivated and brought into obedience, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 5. The word of God deſtroyeth all thoſe ſtrong holds, and they are glad that this ſpiritual light ſhould enter into their hearts. Oh there is little hopes of a proud, froward, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villing perſon, that loveth to be arguing and contradicting thoſe things that make for purity and godlineſſe: When a man is taught of God, he is eaſily brought off to beleeve, to ſubmit, <hi>A little childe can lead them,</hi> as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> propheſieth, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11. 6. As tractableneſſe in the underſtanding, ſo flexibility in the will, is alſo implied in this heart of fleſh. The will of man, that is the hardeſt part of the ſtone in a man, that is contumacious, wilfull, oppoſite; that is the King, the Lord, the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; till that be maſtered, till that ſtoop, nothing in man will turn to God: but this converting grace makes willing of unwilling, makes it to chooſe and imbrace that which once it abhorred; as <hi>Paul, What wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Oh it's th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe wills of men, that are the great enemies to godlineſſe. Hence God is ſaid to work in us <hi>to will,</hi> as well as <hi>to do,</hi> Phil. 3. To will, this is admirable; oh pray importunately that God would give thee to will good, that God would give thee to chooſe and imbrace it. It's wonderfull to conſider how this hard iron, when melted by grace, will be put into any frame or faſhion.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, This fleſhy heart implieth, <hi>An obediential reſignation of our ſelves up into Gods hands.</hi> That now we ſtand at nothing, we refuſe nothing, we object <note place="margin">5.</note> nothing, we do not pick and chuſe in our obedience, This (O Lord) I could do, but excuſe me in the other thing. No, a fleſhy heart is that which is all over yielding and ſubmitting: He doth not ſay, I will give them an heart partly of ſtone, and partly of fleſh; for although ſtonineſſe be in the regenerate heart, yet becauſe it is not there by conſtant prevalency and univerſality, therefore it is ſtill an heart of fleſh, ſo that nothing will diſcover this work upon thy ſoul, ſooner then an obediential reſignation to all duties. He that breaks one is guilty of all, in this ſenſe, becauſe he breaks <hi>vinculum obedientiae,</hi> the bond of obedience, which is the authority of the law-giver: For to be fleſhy ſuppoſeth a capacity and eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to receive any impreſſion: whereſoever it findes a command, there it crieth out, <hi>Lo here am I to do thy will, O God: Thy law is written in my heart.</hi> We ſhall not inlarge this particular more, becauſe the explication of a ſtony heart, doth by way of contrariety illuſtrate this fleſhy heart. Let us therefore take notice of the ſeverall effects and conſequents of a fleſhy heart, and they are remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable. <note place="margin">The effects and conſequents of a fleſhy heart. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>This heart of fleſh is accompanied with an awfull fear and trembling under the word of God, and his glorious Majeſty.</hi> They have deep thoughts of fear and reverence when they come before God. Thus <hi>Ioſiah,</hi> whoſe heart was tender, and melting, did alſo tremble at the threatning in the word of God. If <hi>Abraham</hi> was ſo deeply debaſed in his ſpiritual approach to God, becauſe he was but duſt and aſhes, how much rather becauſe of ſin! We may then quickly diſcover grace in the tenderneſs of it, if it be not prophane, careleſs, and formall in religious duties. If thy heart be a melting heart, thy praiers are melting praiers, thy hearing is melting hearing, thou wouldſt not be ſo ſenſeleſſe, careleſſe in theſe duties as moſt men a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e. Oh then cry out of thy ſelf, for the want of this gracious diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. Thou findeſt thy heart like braſſe and Iron, not like fleſh, when thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>A gracious fleſhy heart doth readily bow and yield to God in all afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and chastiſements for ſin.</hi> The ſtubborn oak, <hi>that</hi> will ſooner break then bow; <note place="margin">2.</note>
                     <pb n="519" facs="tcp:30767:285"/>
but the tender withe, that will move every way, as it is deſired: and thus it is here, Men of ſtony hearts, unbroken hearts, if any waies afflicted or chaſtiſed for ſin, how full of rage, diſcontent, fury, and all manner of vexation, fretting even at God himſelf and all his inſtruments! but the tender fleſhy heart that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently accepts of the puniſhment of its ſin, as God calls upon, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 41. It ſaith with the Church, <hi>I will bear the indignation of the Lord, becauſe I have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt him.</hi> It wholly ſtudieth to clear and juſtifie God, but to condemn and accuſe it ſelf: O then let the people of God in the midſt of all the waves and tempeſts that riſe in their ſoul, remember to allay all by this, that they are fleſhy and not ſtone. That as God made it an argument to take off his afflicting hand, becauſe it was frail weak fleſh; <hi>Gen. 6. My ſpirit ſhall not alwaies ſtrive with man, becauſe he is fleſh:</hi> ſo he may alſo abate his anger, becauſe thou art gracious and tender fleſh. This is a precious ſymptom of grace, when thy ſoul afflicted, is like a box of precious oyntment broken, or like ſweet flowers pounced, many precious and fragrant graces diſcover themſelves. As the fire doth diſcover the mettals, whether good or bad; and tempeſts and windes, whether trees be well rooted or no; ſo do calamities, whether men be gracious or no; and in nothing doth thy grace more manifeſt it ſelf then juſtifying God, and abhorring thy ſelf. Have any frettings, any repinings made a commotion in thy heart? quiet all, and remember, the work of grace is to make a man yielding and readily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The godly heart of fleſh is ſo tender, that it doth not only avoid ſin it ſelf,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>but the occaſions of it, the appearance of it.</hi> Abſtain from all <hi>appearance of evil, 1 Theſ. 5. 22. David</hi> would not drink the water of <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> becauſe it had the appearance of mens bloud, and thus the godly are to provide all things honeſt in the ſight of all men. Chriſt that would not waſh his hands before meal, though otherwiſe a civil cuſtom, in it ſelf lawfull, yet he refuſed, that he might not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Jews in their ſuperſtitious conceit about it, did hereby inſtruct us that we ſhould not only keep from the fire of ſin, but alſo from the very flame. The firſt ſin that proved ſo fatall to all mankinde came by occaſions and temptations; <hi>Eve</hi> ſaw the fruit that it was good, and deſirable. God had not commanded her to forbear looking on it, but this became a temptation to her, and by thoſe win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of her eies death comes in. This made <hi>Paul</hi> keep down his body. This cauſed <hi>Job</hi> to make a covenant with his eies; and <hi>David</hi> to ſet a watch before his mouth. Look then to this, wouldſt thou know whether this gracious ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der heart be in thee or no; art thou then afraid to come near the brink of ſin, any thing that hath the appearance of it, thou runneſt away from it, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did from his rod, when turned into a ſerpent. This you ſhould eſpecially obſerve who venture into the occaſions of wickedneſſe, haunt the places where the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane luſts of the fleſh are daily committed: You do like the moth, that never leaveth buzzing and flying about the candle, till ſhe hath burnt her ſelf. The He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews that were to eat no unleavened bread in the Paſſeover for ſeven daies, were ſo carefull, that they did diligently ſearch the houſe, to ſee none was there, yea they would not ſo much as make mention of the word ſignifying bread, leſt it ſhould do hurt, and tempt any. And wilt not thou be afraid to come where the infection of the plague of any ſin is? Doſt thou fear the infection of the body, and not that of the ſoul? come not then near this mountain, leaſt thou beeſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>A godly heart of fleſh is tender and apprehenſive of all inward heart-ſins,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </note> 
                     <hi>and ſecret ſins, as well as publick and notorious. Paul</hi> had a ſoft heart of fleſh, when he could finde thoſe motes in his eies, and complains of them as beams, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. and indeed becauſe the diſhonour of God, and offending of him, is the great mountain and weight upon his ſoul, therefore whatſoever ſin is done in ſecret, he is as ſenſible of it, as if it had been done in the eies of the whole world. That is a known inſtance of the tender heart of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when in the temptation
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:30767:286"/>
of ſecreſie in ſinning, he cried out, <hi>How can I do this and ſin againſt God!</hi> Oh then this diſcovers the many degrees thouſands are off from the tender work of grace: For its a ſhame to ſpeak of what is done by many in ſecret. Secret un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe, ſecret injuſtice and fraud, ſecret theeving, ſecret drunkenneſſe, if it can be carried ſo that the world may not know it, that reproach may not brand them for it, they care not. Oh men of ſtony hearts! Did not God behold thee? Is not darkneſſe and light, night and day all one to him? Never be incouraged to ſin in hope of ſecreſie, for God will bring out thoſe deeds of darkneſſe, without repentance, one time or other, to thy great confuſion. I know no ſuch differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall mark from an hypocrite and a true godly man, as this. An hypocrite may have as great abilities and inlargements, may have as external a ſtrict converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as a godly man: but then in this he alwaies fails, he doth not humble himſelf for, or mortifie inward motions and luſts of ſins. He is not affected with heart-corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe God looks into the heart, and beholds the heart. Oh then, that the word of God might powerfully work upon you in this reſpect. Its not an heart of fleſh, as long as wicked, proud, earthly, unclean thoughts can lodge in thy ſoul, though they break not out into action.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>A tender heart of fleſh is greatly afflicted with the diſhonour that is done to God by other mens ſins as well as his own. David</hi> muſt needs have a very ſoft heart, <note place="margin">5.</note> when rivers of water came from his eies, becauſe men kept not Gods Law. Fleſh is eaſily wounded, it is eaſily pierced, and thus is a godly mans heart, becauſe God is not owned, is not magnified where he liveth. The Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> cried out, <hi>We is me becauſe I dwell among men of unclean lips,</hi> Iſa. 6. 5. How then do other mens impieties work upon thee? are they like a ſword in thy bowels? Doth the tearing and rending of Gods Name by blaſphemous courſes, even tear and rend thy heart? Doth the prophane naming of the wounds and bloud of Chriſt, even make wounds and bloud in thy heart? then thou maieſt praiſe God, that he hath not left thee without zeal for his glory. Is thy ſoul grieved and tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſeeing and beholding the wickedneſſe of men done in the world?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> 1. Of conſolation and comfort to thoſe to whom God hath vouchſafed this tender and ſoft heart. Its ſuch a mercy thou couldſt not help thy ſelf to, nor <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> all the world could vouchſafe it to thee. Say, <hi>Bleſſe the Lord O my ſoul, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire his grace, who hath thus melted thee.</hi> The time was when thou waſt harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and bold in ſin, thou couldſt ſwallow down great Camels, and it did not trouble thee; thou couldſt commit ſuch and ſuch impieties, and thy heart would never ſmite thee for it. Oh but now if there be any diſtemper, any rebellion, any unkindneſſe in thy life to God; it diſſolves thee, it moveth thy bowels: go on bleſſing God for this mercy. Do not think it a loſſe to thee, nor a reproach to thee: Not a loſſe, for happily thou maieſt ſay, If I had not ſuch a tender heart, if I were not ſo afraid to ſin againſt God, I might get ſuch earthly advantages: If I were as bold and as large in my principles as others, then I could thus inrich my ſelf; but this tender heart of mine hinders me. Do not judge this a loſſe but again; the later end of this will be a rich crop, though for the preſent thou haſt but gleanings: God doth with thee as <hi>Boaz</hi> with <hi>Ruth;</hi> firſt he gave her but gleanings, and a little meaſure of Corn, but afterwards he gave her himſelf and all that he had. Thus God at laſt will give the injoyment of himſelf and eternal glory, when hardened ſinners ſhall vomit up their advantages, which will be like gravel in the mouth. Nor do not thou judge it a reproach; the world judgeth it puſillanimity, a tender heart, a fooliſh, ſcrupulous heart. But as it is ſaid of God, <hi>He can do all things,</hi> only he cannot ſin, for that is an impotency, <hi>Potentiſſimè hoc non poteſt;</hi> ſo it is here, thou dareſt looſe thy comforts, thy advantages; thou dareſt be hated, perſecuted, only thou dareſt not ſin, <hi>Magnanimiter hoc non audes!</hi> At the day of death, at the day of judgement, what boldnes, what confidence wilt thou have? when the great bold men of the world ſhall tremble like leaves, and have fear round about them.</p>

                  <p>THe Doctrine about <hi>An heart of fleſh,</hi> hath already been explained, and ſome practical uſe made of it: And the matter being ſo exceeding neceſſary; (for without this <hi>Heart of fleſh,</hi> we preach in vain, you hear in vain, Gods mercies, and Gods chaſtiſements are in vain;) I ſhall therefore adde another Uſe, by way of Exhortation, Not to have any reſt or quiet in your ſouls, till God vouchſafe this mercy to you: God here promiſeth it, as the main mercy, to qualifie and ſanctifie all their temporal mercies; as if return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Captivity, injoying their own Countrey, their Liberties, Houſes and Comforts again, were nothing, if this <hi>Heart of fleſh</hi> was not alſo beſtowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. And to ſpeak to our condition; though God hath brought us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, that by the laſt wars were ſcattered one from another; though many of thoſe fears and terrors that did then overwhelm, are in ſome meaſure abated; yet if God give not this <hi>Heart of fleſh,</hi> a worm will quickly ariſe and conſume this gourd: Be therefore as importunate with God, as the Widow was with the unjuſt Judge; for God loveth importunity, he loveth ſeeking, knocking, fervent praying; and if the unjuſt Judge was overcome by importunity, how much rather will the bowels of a gracious God move towards thee? How graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly did God reward that Petition of <hi>Solomons,</hi> becauſe he did not ask for riches, long life, the life of his enemies, but wiſdom to diſcharge his truſt: So will God ſay to thee, Becauſe thou haſt not asked temporal mercies, nor earthly greatneſs, but a tender ſoft heart, be it according to thy deſire. As <hi>David</hi> therefore reſolved, <hi>He would give no ſleep to his eyes, or ſlumber to his eye-lids, till he had ſettled the Ark:</hi> So do thou reſolve to have no reſt in thy minde, or to let God alone, but importune him day and night, till he hath made that heart of ſtone fleſh within thee: Oh! why are you ſolicitous about earthly things! what you ſhall eat, what you ſhall drink, what you ſhall put on? and not in a godly manner enquiring, How may I pray, hear, live, dye, with this ſoft and tender heart? And if reaſon may be any motive to you, conſider, how much may be ſpoke for this particular.</p>

As it is the nature of ſin to harden, and to make obſtinate, ſo of grace to mollifie and ſoften: Now there is always in every condition, in every occurrence of providence, ſomething that would ſtiffen the heart againſt God, were not grace a continual thawer of the heart by the heat thereof: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou wouldſt be preſerved from thoſe ſad falls, and wretched backſlidings, which others have been tumbled into, Keep up this heart of fleſh; Oh it could never be that thou wouldſt entertain ſuch monſtrous Doctrines, or do ſuch unjuſtifiable practices, if thy heart were of fleſh: No, it is of ſteel and iron, of a rock, or adamant, and that makes thee bold to commit ſuch ſins, which tender godly perſons have their hearts ake at, and their ears tingle to hear.</p>

                     <hi>and the woful effects of it;</hi> which are woes, wounds of conſcience, hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of heart, darkneſs and gloomineſs of ſoul, ſad tears, leſt God hath for ever forſaken them; the loſs of all their former ſweet peace and communion they had with God: Oh! God of a gracious father, is now become a frowning ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; their hearts are made like an hell, wherein legions of ſad unbelieving thoughts do conſtantly lodge: This is the portion of thoſe godly men, who by negligence, careleſneſs and hardneſs of heart, come to fall off from their former meaſure of holineſs: Oh but a tender heart of fleſh, as it prevents the cauſe of theſe, ſo the effects likewiſe; it will keep thee from this roaring Lyon: So that as ſoon as ever thou findeſt this ſoft heart abating in thee, do thou then fear ſome grievous ſtorm may be coming on thee, if God prevent not.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Without a tender heart of fleſh, a man cannot perform any Religious</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>duty, in an acceptable manner to God:</hi> Prayer without this heart of fleſh, is like a dry unſavory herb; hearing of the word, if it come not from an heart thus ſoftned, is but deſperate boldneſs againſt God, and ſo an immediate provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his anger. Hence a broken heart is preferred above all ſacrifices, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. above all outward worſhip; they are the body, this is the ſoul; they muſt not be neglected, but this is the <hi>Benjamin,</hi> without whom, we muſt not ſee Gods face: Oh then as thou dareſt not but pray, and hear, and come to Church, ſo alſo be as much afraid, leſt thoſe duties be done without an heart of fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>A tender heart of fleſh is accompanied with patience, under the ſoreſt</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>afflictions, and thankfulneſs under the leaſt mercies:</hi> What a ſudden tempeſt and whirlwind of afflictions fell upon <hi>Iob;</hi> and <hi>yet in all that he did not charge God fooliſhly,</hi> Job 1. <hi>ult.</hi> but reproved his impatient wife with this ſaying, <hi>Shall we receive good, and not evil from the Lord?</hi> And as for thankfulneſs under the leaſt mercies, ſee how the Church in the <hi>Lamentations</hi> can taſte a little honey in an ocean of gall; <hi>Its of the Lords mercy that we are not conſumed,</hi> Lam. 3. 22. and ſo the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> acknowledgeth her ſelf a dog, and is glad of the crums that fall from the table, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 27. Now what a lovely and comely ſight is this; to ſee a Chriſtian patient under the greateſt trouble, and thankful under the leaſt mercies! and there is nothing will bring the heart to this admirable tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but the fulfilling of this promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>This tender heart of fleſh, is the onely fit ſoil, wherein the word of God ſown, will grow up, and bring a plentiful crop:</hi> For as they ſay of the ſoul, <hi>Animae</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>fabricat ſibi domicilium,</hi> The ſoul faſhioneth and prepareth the body, for it ſelf to dwell in; as the Spider makes her own web, wherein ſhe reſides: Thus the word of God at firſt makes the heart of hard and ſtony, fleſhy and ſoft, which when done, then is the heart ever afterwards a fit room to receive this ſpiritual gueſt: So that the word never thriveth or proſpers, in reſpect of the progreſs
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:30767:287"/>
and increaſe of godlineſs, but where it meeteth with a tender heart. <hi>Lydia</hi>'s heart is ſaid to be opened to attend to the words of <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 16. 14. Thus naturally mens ſpirits are bolted, the word findes a gate of braſs upon it, till it be made tender, and after that its careful to loſe nothing: Oh then that we could ſay of our hearers, what <hi>Paul</hi> of the <hi>Corinthians, The word is written in their fleſhy tables of the heart,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. Now for the better clearing of theſe things, it may be demanded:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Whether all tenderneſs and ſoftneſs of heart, be this work of grace here promiſed?</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Queſt.</hi> Whether all tenderneſs be this work of Grace here promiſed. <hi>Anſw.</hi> No: For there is a natural tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</note> 
                     <hi>may not the ſoul be deceived about tenderneſs of heart?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes, very eaſily; for there is a twofold ſoft heart of fleſh, which yet is not the heart in the Text.</p>
                  <p>There is a natural ſoftneſs or aptneſs to relent, and to be pitifully affected; ſuch as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of in himſelf, when he read the Hiſtory of <hi>Dido,</hi> Lord (ſaith he) I could not but weep when I read that, and yet at the ſame time I could not weep for my ſins. That tender heart of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> whereby he diſſolved into tears concerning his brethren, was not ſo much an act of grace, as of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural tenderneſs: And it ſhould ſeem he was a tender father to all <hi>Egypt,</hi> as ſome expound that name they gave <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> when they bleſſed him, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him <hi>Abrech, Tender Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>There is another tenderneſs or ſoftneſs, whereby men are ſo melted under</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">And a Legal, neither of which are this heart here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed.</note> 
                     <hi>the conſideration of ſin, as they refuſe, like</hi> Rachel, <hi>to be comforted:</hi> It ſeemeth <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> was too tender, by that remedy our Saviour applyed, when he bid her <hi>Be of good comfort, her ſins were forgiven,</hi> Luke 7. 48. To be ſure the Inceſtuous perſon was too ſoft this way, inſomuch that he was even ſwallowed up with ſorrow, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. For as the ſtring of the inſtrument, if it be too wet, can make no melodious ſound; ſo neither can an heart overwhelmed with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ſet forth the praiſe of God with faith and thankfulneſs.</p>
                  <p>It will be therefore worth the while, to diſcover this <hi>Counterfeit heart of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit of this Heart of fleſh, viz. I. Natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. How it differs from gracious tenderneſs.</note> 
                     <hi>fleſh,</hi> from a gracious one: And let us examine the firſt, which if put to the Touch-ſtone, will be thus diſcovered:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Natural tenderneſs ariſeth from the bodily conſtitution, or natural tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a man;</hi> whereas this gracious ſofneſs is the work of God in a ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural way: Thus in the Text, <hi>I will give the heart of fleſh:</hi> God as the Author of grace makes this; ſo <hi>Zach. 12. I will pour upon them the ſpirit of prayer, and they ſhall mourn for their ſin,</hi> Rom. 8. Thoſe groans unutterable, which came from an heart of fleſh, are wholly attributed to the ſpirit of God; ſo that the tender heart of the one, is like <hi>Egypt,</hi> that is not made fruitful by rain from heaven; whereas the other comes onely from above: If then you go to the fountains from whence theſe ſtreams flow, they are as far diſtant as heaven and earth; and if ye ſee them both melting and diſſolving into tears, under the chaſtiſements and judgements of God upon them; the one hath a ſpring from under the earth, the other from heaven above: Do not therefore preſently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude grace is there, when you ſee a tender, ſoft, yielding diſpoſition, for this may come from nature, as well as grace; it may be a natural complexion, not a principle of Sanctification within.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The inſtrument by which this ſoftneſs and tenderneſs of heart is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, is far different from the other:</hi> For the natural ſoftneſs is wrought, by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the objects of pity and compaſſion; but this gracious ſoftneſs is by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and by the word preached: So that the inſtrument by which a man comes to be thus changed from his obſtinacy, is wholly by the word of God; that received by faith, hath been the furnace or coals of fire to the iron, that doth make it flexible for every ſhape; whereas the former is onely by a natural ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy between the eye and the heart: The eye affects the heart, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 51. and hereupon tenderneſs is wrought; its not a work of faith, which as it purifieth the heart, ſo it makes the heart tender. <hi>By faith Noah was moved with fear,</hi>
                     <pb n="524" facs="tcp:30767:288"/>
Heb. 11. and by faith we finde the rockineſs of our heart ſubdued, and we readily yielding unto God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The motive, <hi>Which is the very ſame thing in Morals, that the ſpecifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal form is in naturals; in this there is a great gulf between one and another:</hi> For the <note place="margin">3.</note> onely motive of this natural tenderneſs, is outward evil and miſery, not ſin, or the diſpleaſure of God: There are hundreds of people, that for the loſs of dear friends, or outward comforts, can weep till they are able to weep no more, but are as a rock, and as hard as a ſtone, in reſpect of any conſideration about ſin; yet ſin is the greateſt evil, and that which depriveth the ſoul of the moſt excellent good: Thou art therefore very prone to ſigh, to be troubled, thy heart is like a fountain of water; But what is the reaſon? outward diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, want of ſuch mercies as thou doeſt propound to thy ſelf: Alas, this is not an heart of fleſh, in the ſenſe of the Text; indeed it is too much an heart of fleſh in another ſenſe; for it is wholly carnal, and is carried out upon carnal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations: If therefore thy tenderneſs and ſoftneſs of heart, be in the want of Gods favor, and the apprehenſion of his diſpleaſure, as <hi>Davids</hi> ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten was; no doubt but thou haſt then felt the power of this promiſe to thee.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>A natural ſoftneſs and tenderneſs, is flexible to any evil; it will receive any impreſſion of ſin:</hi> But this gracious ſoftneſs, though it be fleſh to what is <note place="margin">4.</note> good, it doth eaſily receive that; yet its a ſtone and an adamant to what is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; and this is a remarkable difference: you have many ſoft and flexible hearts, and that is their fault, for none ſo inſnared as they; they are like wax, that receive the ſtamp of any ſeal upon them; they are like the reed that is ſhaken up and down with every wind; now this is a great ſin. It was <hi>Reubens</hi> curſe, <hi>To be unſtable like water:</hi> To be for good in good company, and for evil in evil company; to be ſuch a Chamelion according to every company, is contrary to thoſe many commands, <hi>To be ſtedfaſt and unmoveable in the work of the Lord,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 58. <hi>And to confeſs Chriſt and his truth, in the midſt of a crooked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe generation,</hi> Luke 12. 8. <hi>Their yea ſhould be yea, and their nay, nay:</hi> Oh do not judge this the gracious heart of fleſh; for he that hath this grace, though he be like a Lamb, and all ſweetneſs of carriage be in him; yet he is alſo like a Lyon, in reſpect of courage and boldneſs for what is good: So then conſider, that as the work of grace is in one ſenſe making man tender; ſo in another ſenſe it doth eſtabliſh and ſettle upon a rock.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>This natural tenderneſs can, and often doth conſist, without any trouble and grief for the diſhonor of God, wrought by other mens ſins.</hi> Now you have <note place="margin">5.</note> heard, that a gracious heart of fleſh was eaſily wounded and torn aſunder in pain, for the wickedneſs of others: You heard, <hi>David</hi> had rivers of waters running down his eyes, becauſe men kept not the Law of God; but how many may ye ſee of tender ſoft ſpirits, that are very ſenſeleſs ſtones of the blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and impieties that others are guilty of! They have ſuch in their families, they have ſuch in their company, and in their delight; How can he be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a godly man, to whom a wicked ungodly man is not a torment and a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then: <hi>Horror hath taken hold on me,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, becauſe of the wicked,</hi> Pſal. 119. 53. Oh if thy heart were ſenſible of Gods glory, horror and trembling would ſurpriſe thee, to ſee or hear others commit iniquity, even as if thou didſt ſee them falling into the fire, or deep waters.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In the next place, let us conſider the other ſinful tenderneſs, and <note place="margin">II. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">

                        </gap>.</note> that is, <hi>When the heart is indeed godly for the main, but there is a degeneration:</hi> This tenderneſs doth go beyond its bounds: God indeed by his grace doth wound the heart, but then it bleeds too much, and ſo groweth the weaker thereby: Now the ſinfulneſs of this ſoftneſs will appear thus:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>When it hinders a man from thoſe other gracious duties that God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire:</hi> All grace is conſonant, and one grace is to be added to another, and they
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:30767:288"/>
are to cooperate one with another, even thoſe that ſeem to be at the greateſt diſtance; thus Joy and trembling, faith and fear, are to accompany one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Now there are ſome graces, that it is very hard to have co operate with this heart of fleſh; and therefore we muſt take heed that our gold become not droſs, that we do not take even ſin for grace: This is worſe then to take <hi>Iohn Baptiſt for Chriſt,</hi> this is to take a falſe Chriſt for the true one: And this is done firſt, when they caſt both their eyes upon their ſins onely, not at all eying Chriſt; as if the Iſraelite wounded by a Serpent, ſhould always have cryed out of his pain and roſting, but never look up to the exalted Serpent: This the inceſtuous perſon was blamed for, he was ready to be ſwallowed up with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: When thy ſoul is ſo dejected, that it refuſeth the comfort of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, will ſuffer no oil to be poured in its wounds, this is a ſinful ſoftneſs; this is as wetted paper, the moiſture of it hinders any writing upon it; and ſo the ſoftneſs of thy heart makes the glorious promiſe of the Goſpel not to be writ on thy ſoul; for as God writes the Law of obedience in the hearts of the godly, ſo alſo the Goſpel of comfort in their ſouls: And as hardneſs of heart hinders the former writing, ſo too much ſoftneſs and moiſture the latter: Know then, that all tenderneſs and ſoftneſs, which keeps off from Chriſt, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects the promiſe of grace, is ſinful, and is not of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>If thy tenderneſs and ſoftneſs make thee more unable and unfit for any</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>ſervice unto God:</hi> If it weaken thee, that thou canſt not pray, do or ſuffer for God, this is alſo ſinful; when it makes thee have feeble hands and knees, as the childrens bones and joynts are ſo ſoft at firſt, that they cannot go, this is ſinful. The trees that have not their ſap and juice excocted out, are not able to bear up any building; and ſo the ſoul that is inordinately tender, and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſoftned, it cannot go through with the work of the Lord: See there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that thy tenderneſs makes thee not leſs ſerviceable.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>If this tenderneſs makes thee ſlaviſhly and ignorantly ſcrupulous, that thou</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>canſt not enjoy the Liberty of the Goſpel, and the freedom of the ſpirit, which Chriſt hath purchaſed for thee:</hi> Though this may ſeem wonderful tenderneſs, yet it is not ſo indeed: Its true indeed, as we told you, the godly through their ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, abſtain from all appearances of evil, and they fear ſin may be, where it is not; yet they do not incourage a ſlaviſh, ſcrupulous diſpoſition; but they labor for a ſound minde, and a filial frame wrought by the ſpirit of adoption: So that although there are too too few in the world, that need the regulating or moderating of their tenderneſs; yet ſome there are, and this may be a word of ſeaſon to them, Do not take that doubtful, fearful ſpirit of thine, for this heart of fleſh; let not the water overflow the banks, for then it preſently gets ſoil, and is turned into mud.</p>
                  <p>Let the concluſion be by way of Information, concerning the curſed and miſerable eſtate of thoſe, who have not this promiſed mercy of <hi>An heart of fleſh.</hi> As <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Scrol had woe and lamentation written within and without; ſo hath ſuch a wicked man the inward and outward curſes of Gods word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to him: Oh thou rock and ſtone! that art neither by the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, exhortations or reproofs of the word, ſoftned; nor yet by his mercies or judgements mollified: How could thy heart indure againſt all thoſe ways God hath uſed to melt thee. Conſider, that thy heart is naturally an heart of fleſh, in reſpect of the frailty and weakneſs of it; Why then ſhould it not be an heart of fleſh in a gracious ſenſe? Were thy heart of braſs, and iron; were it immortal, and ſuch as could not dye; then thou mighteſt go on with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in thy ſin, and ſay, Who ſhall contradict? but it being an heart of fleſh, fainting, miſerable, and always dying: Oh why ſhould not this ſtir thee up to be partaker of this ineſtimable mercy! Oh cry out, and ſay, Lord, my weak frail fleſh, cryeth out for that tender heavenly fleſh; and further, thy heart being naturally of fleſh, how unable is it to combate with the wrath of God,
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:30767:289"/>
who is an infinite ſpirit? Thy heart cannot keep off thoſe ſharp arrows, which he ſhall ſhoot into thy heart of fleſh; Why then doeſt thou not take that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, to agree with thy adverſary in the way; with God, who for the preſent is thy enemy, while thou art in the way, before death come, and then there be no ranſom: Oh that you would meditate of the terror of God, how eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he can fill that heart of fleſh with helliſh horror; how ſpedily he can make the Devils take thee by the throat, and hale thee to damnation; and if ſo, there is no remedy, but to cry out, Lord make good this promiſe to me: Oh it is this I want, this would make me happy.</p>

                  <p>At this time let us take notice of the mercy, <hi>My Spirit.</hi> It will be very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to give you a Theological, and Biblical uſe of the word <hi>Spirit,</hi> which is of a great latitude in its ſignification. In this place a three-fold ſenſe may claim to be underſtood, which alſo may eaſily be compoſed and united, not oppoſed: For,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By Gods Spirit, may be meant the third Perſon in the Trinity: ſo that they are promiſed here to be made partakers of it. Its a very grave and ſolid diſpute in Divinity, whether the godly, beſides the graces and fruit of the Spirit, are alſo made partakers of the Spirit it ſelf: ſome affirm it, others deny it. But no doubt ſeverall places of Scripture doe evidently demonſtrate that we do receive
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:30767:290"/>
not onely the graces of the Spirit, but the Spirit it ſelf; and therefore the Spirit is ſaid to dwell in us, and we are the temples of the Holy Ghoſt: But yet this is in ſuch a ſupernaturall and myſticall way, that though the plain Texts compell us to believe it, yet the manner how is very difficult to expreſſe: but this is not my work to doe at this time.</p>
                  <p>A ſecond ſenſe may be by ſpirit, to underſtand the ſoul, or ſpirit of a man, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and qualified by the graces of the Spirit; and therefore its called in the verſe before, <hi>A new Spirit,</hi> which is the ſame with <hi>a new heart.</hi> So that Spirit is here put for the ſoul of a man, enlivened and quickned by the graces of Gods Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: and this ſenſe we conceive to be the moſt genuine and proper. Hence <hi>Ezek. 18. verſe</hi> 31. where you have that commanded as a duty, which is here promiſed as a gift: <hi>Make ye a new heart, and a new ſpirit;</hi> which cannot be primarily un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the Perſon of the Spirit, but the graces of the Spirit. The laſt enſe that may here come in, is to take ſpirit, for heavenly activity, vigor, and holy impulſes, and motions from God, which are as the winde to the ſails, to carry it to its expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Haven. Now the firſt and this latter ſenſe cannot wholly be excluded, yet the ſecond is that, which I will pitch upon as moſt proper, bringing in the other by conſequence.</p>
                  <p>Doct. <hi>That Converſion is the enlivening, or qualifying of a man with the graces of Gods Spirit.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Doct.</note>

                  <p>Thus <hi>Iohn 3. That which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</hi> Hence the Godly are ſaid to have the Spirit in them, and guided by it, led by it, and are ſaid to walk af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it. I need not multiply places for this. As Chriſts body was by an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſupernatural manner, the Holy Ghoſt over-ſhadowing the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> In ſuch a miraculous way as to humane power and ſtrength, is this new, holy, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Creature bogotten. The Spirit of God moving upon the waters of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, produceth this ſpiritual man: As at firſt God made the Fowls of the aire out of water, which ſoar up to the heavens.</p>
                  <p>To improve this neceſſary point, let us conſider, what is implyed in this promiſe, <hi>I will put my ſpirit into you:</hi> And,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>It ſuppoſeth every man naturally a meer dead lump, without life or motion</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">What is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed in this promiſe, <hi>I will put my ſpirit within you.</hi> 1.</note> 
                     <hi>of himſelf to any thing that is holy.</hi> For as God at firſt breathed into <hi>Adam</hi> the breath of life, <hi>and he became a living ſoul;</hi> So God doth ſtill infuſe into us his graces, that make us live the life of the Spirit. Hence ſome Expoſitors make this promiſe to be Parabolically repreſented in the next Chapter, by the reſurrection of dry bones, whereas the winde is called upon to come and breath upon the Bones and ſinews and all parts to be united together, that they may live: So doth God in the Converſion of men. But that Parable is to repreſent the recovery of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of their Captivity, and miſerable eſtate; which as to the eye of ſenſe, had no more poſſibility ever to return again then thoſe dry bones to live. Yet by way of ſimilitude, it may alſo repreſent their reſtitution unto a ſpiritual life of Grace, unto which they had more impoſſibility than to return unto their own Land. Oh then this very phraſe, <hi>I will put my Spirit into you,</hi> ſhould fall like thunder and lightning upon all thoſe Doctrines and Opinions that maintain Free-will, or the power of nature in Converſion. Can man co-operate to the infuſion of Gods Spirit? The order of nature, and the order of Grace, differ as much as heaven and earth, and one cannot prepare for the other; ſo that this expreſſion doth inform that we all are animall or ſenſual, deſtitute of the ſpirit. And as bruit beaſts cannot perform the Offices or acts of Reaſon; ſo neither can men naturally doe the actions of grace; he cannot pray or hear ſpiritually, he cannot love God, or repent of a ſin in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall manner.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>This doth ſuppoſe an elevating or lifting up the heart of a man to thoſe affections and actions, which otherwiſe are far above his power.</hi> For as the Spirit of <note place="margin">

upon him, and gave him ſuch mighty ſtrength; ſo <hi>Paul</hi> had another Spirit, in reſpect of Government: thoſe gifts of Gods Spirit in the Church that made them work miracles, ſpeak with tongues, lifted them above humane power; ſo this Spirit of God ſanctifying, doth alſo raiſe a man to ſuch holy, ſpiritual, and ſublime dutie, that in former times he was not acquainted with: neither did he underſtand. Hence to be a man, to walk as a man, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 2. in the Scripture Phraſe is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution, and a carnal imperfection, becauſe we are to have the Spirit of God who inables us to ſpirituall actions in a divine manner. Thus to believe in God, to love God, to be heavenly minded, to be patient, even every exerciſe of grace, are acts tranſcendent the power of a man, and God muſt put his Spirit into us to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us thereunto. And this is that which makes the world ſo miſtake about god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, that makes them groſſely erre about ſerving of God, and repenting of ſin; They doe theſe things as men, by cuſtome, by the principles they were born in; ſo that till this Text be made good in you, <hi>I will put my ſpirit in you,</hi> our Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are but ſo many <hi>Golgothaes,</hi> places of dead mens skuls.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, To have the Spirit of God put into us, denoteth, <hi>That we doe all our duties upon thoſe motives which are by Divine Revelation in the Word man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>us,</hi> For the Spirit of God works in his people two wayes.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Effectually,</hi> By inlivening, and enabling of them to holy duties.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Directively.</hi> By his Word guiding and leading of them. Now in the Word of God we are directed to ſuch Motives in our actions, which humane light would never diſcern, as to doe duties. Firſt, Meerly becauſe God commands, out of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Soveraignty, becauſe it is the Law of ſuch a Law-giver. Where is the man that doth not by cuſtome, or becauſe of the talk, and report of men, good things, rather then out of obedience to God? Therefore obſerve the order of the promiſe, <hi>I will put my ſpirit in you,</hi> and then I will cauſe you to walk in my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and do them. Thou then that prayeſt, heareſt, abſtaineſt from groſſe ſins; why is it? Is it becauſe thou haſt reſpect to Gods Commandment: God ſaith it, and therefore I do it. This is to have the ſpirit in us. But ſecondly, not meerly becauſe of Gods command, but from an inward principle of love, and delight in God alſo, therefore we perform our duties: <hi>If ye love me keep my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, John</hi> 14. 15. Love to God, that preſently makes us do or ſuffer any thing for him. Now love, that is reckoned in the front of the fruits of the Spirit, <hi>Ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>.</hi> 5. and the Spirit of God deſcended in tongues of fire. Of fire, to repreſent the Nature of the Spirit of God: Hence we are commanded not to quench the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. 19. which is like burning fire in our hearts. Oh this performance of duties from love, is that which crowns them, is like the perfume and Frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe at the Sacrifice. Thirdly, we are to perform holy duties, not onely out of love, but for holineſſe ſake, becauſe God is holy, and the duty is holy. <hi>Hate evill,</hi> and cleave to that which is good, be gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>wed to it, and made one with it. <hi>Be ye holy, for I am holy,</hi> ſaith God, Lev. 11. 44, 45. Now as God loveth holineſſe for holineſſe ſake, wills good for goods ſake, (or rather good is good, becauſe he wills it.) Thus ought we, to imitate him, there may be earthly motives, and humane advantages, which may incite the heart to what is good: but goodneſſe for the beauty and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of it ſhould make thee in love with it: Say then as <hi>Abraham</hi> to the King of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, I will not take ſo much as a Shooe latchet from thee, leſt thou ſhouldſt ſay, Thou haſt made Abraham rich:</hi> ſo do thou; I will not ſo much as entertain, or conſult with shy earthly advantage, leſt that ſhould ſay, I have made thee pray, I have made thee profeſſe the Name of Chriſt. Wicked men are carried out to evill for evills ſake: but there is more fulneſſe, goodneſſe and excellency in God, then there can be appearance of theſe in ſin: Therefore it is unſufferable, if when Draff ſhall move for the ſweetneſſe it hath to a diſtempered ſwiniſh appetite, that honey it ſelf ſhall not affect a ſound appetite. But I have ſomewhere elſe ſpoken of the nature of this ſpiritual life: I ſhall therefore in two things more onely inſtance the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty

of Gods Spirit dwelling in the godly, and then ſpeak of the concomitant effects of Gods Spirit in us.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, To have the Spirit of God put into us, as in duties to be done it lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <note place="margin">4.</note> us up above humane ſtrength, or motives, <hi>So in matters of ſufferings, herein the Spirit of God doth wonderfully demonſtrate it ſelf in the Converted.</hi> For hereby they are more then men: God is plainly in them, that they can deny their deareſt comforts, endure the moſt exquiſite torment, and that with joyfulneſſe and alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Look upon <hi>Paul</hi> and the Diſciples of Chriſt in the New Teſtament, What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, perſecutions, ſpoiling of their goods, taking away their lives, were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently executed upon them? and yet with what gladneſſe of heart, with what pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, faith, courage did they endure all, rejoycing that they were accounted worthy to ſuffer any thing for the Name of Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 41. The Hiſtory of the Martyrs doth abundantly declare the Spirit of God put into Believers; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this ſhould ſupport the godly, they are afraid that in times of temptation and of great troubles they ſhould never be faithful to God, they find their hearts ſo weak and feeble that they ſhall never be able to perſevere. Why doſt thou not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the ſame Spirit of God which lifteth thee above nature for active obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, will alſo for paſſive? To love God, to believe in God, to do any reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious duty ſpiritually, fleſh and bloud can no more doe it then Iron of it ſelf can ſwim: but the ſpirit of God takes thee, and fixeth thy heart upon heavenly things. So fleſh and bloud cannot be perſecuted, impriſoned, cannot dye for the glory of Chriſt, but the ſpirit of God can and doth inable hereunto. <hi>Sampſon</hi> could not doe thoſe extraordinary actions of ſtrength as a man, but as having the Spirit of God mighty upon him ſo he did: neither canſt thou do or ſuffer in a gracious manner as a man, without any more power than thy own; but as ſpirituall, as having Gods Spirit in thee ſo thou canſt. VVhat mans power can do in the hour of temptation, <hi>Peters</hi> preſumptuous expreſſion will teach us, <hi>Though all men forſake thee, yet I will not;</hi> and yet he forſook Chriſt more deſperately then any elſe. Oh therefore do nothing that may grieve, or chaſe away the Spirit of God; for who knoweth what Conflicts, what trials God may reſerve thee unto? and then without the mighty work of this Spirit of God, thou wilt prove an Apoſtate, and ſo a very <hi>Iudas</hi> or <hi>Cain</hi> at laſt: for firſt a man is forſaken by the Spirit of God, as ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then as comforting: Not that the Holy Ghoſt is totally and finally ever driven away from him that once had him graciouſly; but there are many looked upon as godly and forward in profeſſion, who are judged ſo by others, and they themſelves make account alſo they are godly; yet in the day of triall make a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Shipwrack of their Faith, and a good Conſcience. Laſtly, becauſe the Spirit of God is thus put into them, they are therefore ſaid to be the Temples of the holy Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. and if their bodies be, much more their ſouls are. O what a ſtrong Obligation is this to all godlineſſe, <hi>You are the Temples of the Spirit of God,</hi> No unclean thing might enter into the Temple! How did God complain, when they made his Temple a Den of thieves. How angry then muſt he needs be, if thou make this Temple a ſtye of Swine, or an hell of Devils? This evidently proclaims that moſt men never had this grace in the Text vouchſafed unto them: For what is there no unclean, no bruitiſh and polluted thing that enters in thy ſoul? Is thy heart as the Temple, an houſe of prayer, an heart of prayer, thy ſoul a ſoul of prayer? Doſt thou not defile this Temple every day by prophane and filthy luſts? VVhat hopes canſt thou ever have that this is made good to thee? Do not hear theſe things, as if they did not at all belong to theee. Doth not thy own heart tell thee, that if the Spirit of God did dwell and work in thee, thou couldſt not doe as thou doſt, nor commit ſuch ſinnes as thou daily committeſt? It was the Devill that was in the Swine, and hurried them violently into the Sea; but the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God appeared in a Dove: With what holineſſe then, and all godlineſſe ſhould you walk, who have this benefit vouchſafed to you? what manner of
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:30767:291"/>
perſons ſhould ye be who are the Temple of the Lord, whoſe ſouls are made an heaven? Is it for you to be vain, earthly and immoderately affected unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Creature? Have you not that within which may be in ſtead of all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to you? Thy frail body is a Cabinet wherein excellent Jewels are.</p>
                  <p>Now that we may the better know whether the Spirit of God be in us, <note place="margin">Of the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spin in a Man.</note> cauſing us to walk in his Commandments, conſider whether the other effects attributed to the Spirit in the Scripture be alſo in thee: for as the Sun vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth heat as well as light, and is not with either of theſe alone: ſo the Spirit of God comes not alone, but hath divers and noble operations with it. Hence ſome expound that place <hi>from the ſeven ſpirits</hi> in the Revelations, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1. 4. of the holy Spirit in its manifold operations. As,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Its called the good Spirit,</hi> Pſalm 143. <hi>Let thy good Spirit lead <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>e,</hi> in <note place="margin">1.</note> oppoſition to the evill ſpirit. So that as the evill ſpirit or the Devil in wicked men is continually inclining and moving of them to all evill thoughts, affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and deſires: They think evill, they conceive evill, they act evill: as the Spider doth onely vent poiſon, ſo the good Spirit of God in good men doth incline and move them to good thoughts, good affections, good actions: Hence they are ſaid to have a good Treaſure in their hearts. And of what conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence it is to have this Spirit of God, appeareth, in that its named for all good things: For whereas one Evangeliſt ſaith; <hi>If ye being evill, know how to give good things, how much more will your heavenly Father beſtow good gifts?</hi> Mat. 7. 11. Another ſaith, <hi>How much more will he beſtow the Spirit?</hi> Luke 11. 13. So that the Spirit is in ſtead of all good things. If then it cannot lie hid, it will be quickly diſcerned, whether this good ſpirit, or that evill wicked ſpirit abides and dwels in thee. The fruit will diſcover the tree: Its ſtrange that people ſhould no more conſider what the Fountain is from whence all flows, whether it be bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſweet.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Its a Spirit of Prayer,</hi> and Supplication, joyned with a tender <note place="margin">2.</note> mourning heart, <hi>Zachary</hi> 12. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. Groans unutterable are ſaid to come from the ſpirit; yea in that place is excellently deſcribed the help, guide and ſupport, which is afforded to the Godly in Prayer, by the Spirit: VVe know not what to pray, or how to pray: ſo that if thou haſt this mercie in the Text, thou findeſt it mightily working in the duty of Prayer, enlightning thy minde, heating thy affections, ſoftning thy heart, ſupporting thee againſt unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, fears and diſtruſt. Indeed the ſpirit of God giveth a Gift of prayer, which many unregenerate and hypocrites have; yea they may be admirable in it: but there is the Grace of prayer, when the ſoul is powred out in a gracious manner, and this is only in the godly. A naturall man cannot pray acceptably, and they truſt in a broken Reed who put confidence in their good prayers, which yet they have by Rote or Cuſtome, not through Gods Spirit. Do not then ſcornfully paſſe over this touchſtone.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Its called <hi>The Spirit of Wiſedome,</hi> and Revelation, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 11. 2. <note place="margin">3.</note> which was firſt communicated to Chriſt the Head, without meaſure, and then like <hi>Aarons</hi> Oyl deſcends to the Members of Chriſt. This Spirit of Revelation, is to ſee and behold the Glory of thoſe things Revealed in the Goſpel, and the diſcerning of things in a ſpirituall manner, which the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall man cannot doe; and the ſpirit of Wiſdome is to make a man under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the matters of Religion in a Godly and practicall manner, ſo to believe and know, as to referre all to Godlineſſe. Now how deſtitute many are of the Spirit in this ſenſe, the ignorance and dulneſſe about holy things doth evidently Demonſtrate; they know and underſtand nothing in the principles of Religion, ſo as to have their lives Transformed by the power of it.</p>
                  <p>Furthly, and laſtly, <hi>Its called the Spirit of Adoption,</hi> Romans 8. 15. <note place="margin">4.</note> which puts a Filiall boldneſſe into us, and makes us call God, <hi>Abba Father:</hi>
                     <pb n="532" facs="tcp:30767:292"/>
Thoſe ſlaviſh fears and ſuſpicious doubts in thee, they come not from Gods Spirit. Theſe drive thee farther off from God, they fill thee with hard and diſcontented thoughts againſt God: No, its the Spirit of Adoption; and as of Adoption, ſo its a Comforter, and an Advocate, <hi>John</hi> 14. 16. As Chriſt is an interceſſor in heaven for us; ſo the ſpirit is in our hearts pleading Gods love, his readineſſe to forgive, his willingneſſe to receive: as the godly are to pray for the Spirit of Sanctification, ſo alſo for the Spirit of Adoption; you are to pray for the Comforts of the Spirit, as well as the Graces; for theſe are wings to the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Uſe of <hi>Inſtruction:</hi> How neceſſary this Grace is to all our Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Oh that God would breath this ſpirituall breath into your ſouls. Oh that <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> you knew experimentally what it is to have the Holy Ghoſt deſcend upon you. We ſpeak not of an extraordinary Miraculous way, much leſſe of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſticall Deluſions and pretended Revelations by the Spirit of Darkneſſe; but the gracious operations of the Spirit in a Sanctifying way. Oh where will you Blaſphemers and wretched Mockers appear, who ſcoff at the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and make a jeer about it? This is not onely to grieve the Spirit of God, which is a grievous ſinne, but to doe deſpite to it. Now if the Spirit of God be vouchſafed to you, it will come with this two-fold benefit.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Its a Spirit of Truth, its called ſo, and its promiſed to lead the Godly into all Truth. Therefore let men never ſo much talk, or boaſt of the Spirit; if they be Errors and Hereſies which they broach, the good and holy Spirit is not in them; or if they be Opinions that carry to looſeneſſe and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; For its an holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond benefit is to doe duties no more in the oldneſſe of the Letter, but the newneſſe of the Spirit; this the Apoſtle calls for. Now to do a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the oldneſſe of the Letter, is cuſtomarily and formally to perform a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing without Chriſt, and his Spirit inabling of us: This is a dead Religion, a dead Faith, and yet few, even very few, goe any further.</p>

                  <p>The Spirit of God is put into their inwards; the law of God is written in their inwards; and therefore the ſpirit of man as ſanctified and renewed, is called of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the <hi>inward man,</hi> Rom. 7. 22. 2 Cor. 4. 16. Alas, we may ſay of many, It's the outward man of their godlineſſe, not the inward; becauſe it conſiſts only in the tongue, and in expreſſions, and tranſient affections at fartheſt, but as for the deep, conſtant and ſolid working of grace, that is a myſtery they underſtand not. Now that the work of grace is ſuch an inward deep changing of a man; is alſo plain, in that its called ſo often, life. Now we know life is not the external motion, or ſpeaking, or eating, or working; but the inward fountain of theſe. Life is the

                     <hi>actus primus,</hi> the firſt act, or fountain, or riſe of all other motions.

This point deſerveth a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfull opening, to go to the inwards of it, as well as that muſt go to our inwards. And firſt, Let us ſhew how farre this grace may be either tendered or received, <note place="margin">How far this grace may be tendred or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and yet not put into our inwards. 1.</note> and yet not put into our inwards.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, it's eaſily granted by all, <hi>That as long as the word of God ſounds only in the ear, and it pierceth no further, here is no deſcending of it into the bowels:</hi> and yet are not the greateſt part of our auditors no further wrought upon, then as to the ear! They come and hear, they ſit and hear, it may be; but ſtill here is no work of the Spirit upon the heart. Our Saviour in his parable compareth ſuch to the high-way ground; the ſeed fell upon it, and preſently the devil, like the birds of the air, fetcheth it away. Oh that men ſhould judge it a great ſin if they did not come and hear, and not alſo think it a greater ſin to hear, and not inwardly to receive the power of the word. For the end of hearing is to let the word fall down into the very bottom of thy ſoul. Phyſick in the mouth, not received into the ſtomack, cannot do any good.

                     </gap>in upon the ſurface of the ground, and not ſoaking to the root, will never make the plant grow; and thus it is here, Though thou heareſt a thouſand ſermons, thou that neglecteſt not any Sabbath day; yet if thou heareſt and heareſt, and only heareſt; the word doth not like <hi>Aarons</hi> oil go from thy ear, thy head, but to thy heart, thy inferiour deep parts of thy ſoul; thou goeſt home as ignorant, as prophane, as obſtinate as thou cameſt hither. Know then that the perfection and fulneſſe of every action lieth in accompliſhing its end, without which it is in vain. Eating without digeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doth not nouriſh, but breed diſeaſes; ſo the end of hearing, is to have a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and divine operation upon the very bowels of thy ſoul. As <hi>Saul</hi> when he was among the Prophets, the ſpirit came on him, and he alſo propheſied. Thus while the word of God, the inſtrument of the ſpirit, is diſplayed before thee, what a mighty change and deep alteration ſhould come upon thee! Thou ſhouldſt go home praying as others, repenting as others, fearing God as others: Do not then give the ear only, but the heart alſo; otherwiſe Chriſt only ſtands at the door and knocks, thou doeſt not let him in.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. A ſecond outward and inſufficient work is, <hi>When the word is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with underſtanding, and the grace of God doth indeed open his eyes ſo far, that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>his minde is inlightned, that he doth both know and believe the truths of Religion, but it goeth no further.</hi> Although this work be inward, being upon the minde of man; yet I call it outward, as in reſpect of the inward parts, mentioned in the Text, for that ſpeaks of more then a minde to know, or an underſtanding to underſtand the things of Religion. Although inlightning be ſometimes put for the whole converſion, and light for grace, yet at other times it's made a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct work from it, and ſuch even as reprobates have, and apoſtates, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. where inlightning, though it be a good, yea and a great gift of God; yet the Apoſtle hopes for better things of them, and things that accompany ſalvation: So that knowledge, parts, underſtanding in Religion doth not neceſſarily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company ſalvation; and we hope better things of men, then to be able to repeat or remember Sermons, or with ſome underſtanding to give an account of the principles of Religion; and many times knowing of Gods will, and doing it, are put as two ſeparable things; how far then are they from the fruit of this promiſe, who remain in groſſe ignorance, who have blinde eies, know nothing about their corruption and miſery by ſin, or about Chriſt, and faith in him! To whom all our Sermons have been as a book ſealed up; unto whom, though in Engliſh, yet we have preached unknown matter: A people likely to dye, and to
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:30767:293"/>
be damned in ignorance; for it underſtanding, knowing men, who receive the word with attention and knowledge; yet if they finde it not changing their inward man, come ſhort of grace, where muſt the ignorant man appear? <note place="margin">3.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The retaining of the word of God in the memory, that is not this grace in the inward parts:</hi> That indeed is very laudable; and a forgetful hearer is blamed by the Scripture, <hi>James 1. 25. Davids</hi> reſolution is, <hi>To hide the word in his heart:</hi> And this is a great cauſe to make it work ſo deeply; for a man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not carry coals of fire long in his boſom, but they will ſet all on a flame; yet the meer retaining it there, doth not attain to the inward parts in the Text.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The tranſient and ſuddain working upon the affections and heart, are not</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>alſo the putting of his ſpirit within us,</hi> or <hi>the writing of the Law in their inward parts:</hi> This comes neareſt, but they want root and continuance, and ſo at laſt wither. <hi>Iohns</hi> hearers did for a ſeaſon rejoye in his light; the temporary Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever doth receive the word with joy, and yet he hath no root: This is a two edged ſword, this truth makes diviſions between the ſecret and hidden things of the heart: Oh how nice a point is that, wherein the temporary and the true convert differ! both pray with ſorrow, both hear with joy, both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form duties with ſome inlargements and ſweetneſs: <hi>Simili fere ſenſu afficiuntur,</hi> ſaid <hi>Calvin:</hi> Yet as two high hills may ſeem very near together at the top, when their bottoms are far diſtant one from another; ſo theſe inlargements, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, may ſeem very near, when the bottom and root do much differ. Oh the Miniſter of God ſhould never be upon this point, but even horror ſhould take hold on the hearer, and he be like one that looketh down an high pinacle, &amp; trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth to ſee how eaſily, and yet dangerouſly he may fall; and yet looking upon the battlements he holds upon, the grace of God, and the promiſe of God, which his ſoul hath had experience of, have hope; ſo put faith and trembling together!</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>The meer external cleanſing of a mans life, from former luſts and groſs</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>impieties, is not this putting the ſpirit within us?</hi> As the Angels, when they took humane bodies, they did but ſeem to eat, and ſeem to do vital actions of life; they could not indeed, becauſe they were not perſonally united to the aſſumed body: ſo all men who have their lives cleanſed, and they ſet up a form of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, they do not theſe things as vital actions of grace; they move, as the wheel of the mill is moved, by the force of the water, not by an inward principle of life: Theſe are compared to Swine waſhed in the water, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning afterwards to the mire: Though the Swine be made as white as the ſheep, yet becauſe not inwardly made a ſheep, therefore ſhe turneth at laſt to her former impurity; but I hint onely theſe things, becauſe treated on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
                  <p>Let us in the next place come to conſider poſitively, what this inward deep work <note place="margin">What this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward deep work of grace is. 1.</note> of grace is, wherein it doth conſiſt: And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>It is then fulfilled in us, when the things of Chriſt, his Glory, Will and Command lie cloſeſt, and neareſt to the heart:</hi> For that is indeed within a man, and intimate, which is next to his heart, as we ſay; and this our Saviour re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth in every Diſciple, <hi>He that loveth father or mother more then me, is not worthy of me,</hi> Mat. 18. 37. We know the love of father and mother is a moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural thing, it comes not by teaching, by cuſtom, its inbred in us as ſoon as we are born; and yet the love of Chriſt, his Glory, and his Commandments ſhould be more intimate then this. Hence the Apoſtle, to expreſs this innate and inward life, ſaith, <hi>I no longer live, but Chriſt in me, the life that I live is by faith in Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. What an emphatical expreſſion is this, <hi>I do not live, but Chriſt;</hi> I live not the life of ſenſe, I eat not, I drink not, I breathe not bodily breath; that is, comparatively to the life of faith: So that you ſee our very natural life, which is the moſt inward and deep thing in a man that is, is ſaid not to be lived, in reſpect of this life of grace, which is more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:30767:294" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then theſe: Oh then examine, how cloſe and dearly heavenly things lie to thy heart: Is there any thing more prized then God, then Grace, then Godlineſs? then know, God hath not put his ſpirit in thee, but the Devil, or the world, and ſin have put their luſts in thee: Now this is a ſure diſcovery of the woful and ſinful eſtate of moſt people, <hi>God is not in all their thoughts,</hi> Chriſt is not in their affections, they chuſe other things rather then him. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, as God and Chriſt is the beloved of their heart; ſo that which is moſt hated and abhorred from the heart, is ſin and all evil; its more loathed then any other thing, more feared, more avoided; ſo that they chuſe affliction and all miſery rather then ſin, their heart is moſt ſenſible and apprehenſive of this: Oh what then can they think of themſelves, who harbor and nouriſh ſin? they no longer live, but ſin in them; this is their meat and drink, to do the works of the Devil: Oh then that at laſt men ſecure and bold in ſin, would be awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: How cometh that to be imbraced in thy boſom, and practiſed in thy life, which thou ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> avoid as hell it ſelf?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>This inward work of grace is ſeen, when the work of humiliation is</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>laid low enough:</hi> We read of the Parable of him that built an houſe, and when the tempeſts and ſtorms aroſe, all fell to the ground immediately; and why? becauſe this was not diged deep enough: Now our repentance and humiliation is then deep enough, when its for ſin as ſin, when its for ſin becauſe its an offence to God, and diſpleaſes him; when they loath themſelves, and count them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves abominable in this reſpect. To be humbled for ſin, as <hi>Ahab</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were often times, becauſe of the temporal judgements following ſin, was not to go deep enough: Oh! herein people come too ſhort, they cry out of their ſins, in the fear of death, in the extremity of pain: Alas, this is not to go to the bottom; there is a worſe thing in ſin, then all the temporal calamities it brings with it; and that is, to offend God, to ſeparate between his favor and thy ſoul: Its therefore very meet, that thy humiliation ſhould be for that which is the worſt evil in ſin. Again, in humiliation men go deep enough, when they do not onely ſtay upon actual ſins, but go to the very original and fountain of all: Thus <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51. he went deep, when beyond his actual ſins of Murther and Adultery he alſo bewailed the native corruption of his ſoul: Oh! the grace of God muſt indeed have a cloſe and inward work in that man, who diſcovers the root of ſin, as well as the branches; the fountain, as well as the ſtream. God in the univerſal deſtruction of the world, did not onely look to the actual impieties then committed, but to the imagination of the thoughts of a mans heart, <hi>which were onely evil, and that continually,</hi> Gen. 6. and thus he that will make a ſure and good iſſue of his humiliation, muſt ſtill dig deeper and deeper; and ſee more and more abominations, till he go to the foul and bitter root of all.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Then the word of God is put in our inward parts, when we do truly, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and unfeignedly, perform all the duties God requireth:</hi> This is to do it with <note place="margin">3.</note> the whole heart; and if we had any thing better then our hearts, they ſhould be offered up to God: Thus <hi>David, Pſal. 51. Thou delighteſt in the truth in the inward parts:</hi> Oh this a man ſhould have in all the ſervice he doth for God! So that all thoſe, who by Religion accompliſh their ſelf-intereſts; all thoſe who ſeek themſelves, have carnal movtives in the profeſſion of Religion; theſe are but pictures, not living creatures in the way of grace: Great is the number of hypocrites, even among thoſe that profeſs the name of Chriſt: Its damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blaſphemy to charge it upon all, as wicked men do; this is to condemn the generation of the godly, to blaſpheme Chriſt and the Goſpel; yet it cannot be but that through the hypocriſies of many, grievous offences and ſcandals will fall out: None of thoſe who follow Chriſt becauſe of the loaves, or who tread out the corn meerly becauſe they may feed on it, ſet up in ſeeming manner the ways of Chriſt, that they may get outward advantages, can by experience

witneſs this promiſe made good to them: They pray, they hear, they perform holy duties, but ſtill they want ſomething within, ſtill the ſoul of all is want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but its not the appearance of Good, not the name or profeſſion of it, will bring thee any true or ſound comfort: The time is coming, when all things without will fail thee, and leave thee; it muſt be ſomething within that may ſupport thee. <note place="margin">Signs and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward deep work of grace in a man. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the next place let us obſerve, What are the ſigns, or the effects of this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward deep work of grace in a man; and they are excellent:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>He doth not reſt in the external outward performance of any holy duty; if all within him be not moved and excited thereunto:</hi> He hath no comfort, no content, in praying, hearing, or any Religious duty, if all the inwards of his ſoul, and the depths of his heart, have not alſo been moved therein: Thus <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, and let all within thee praiſe his holy name.</hi> Pſal. 104. 1. <hi>All within thee,</hi> obſerve that: Thus the godly, as the Cock ſtirreth up himſelf before he crows, do prepare and ſtir up themſelves to every duty: <hi>Hear the word of God, O my ſoul, and let all within thee give ear thereunto;</hi> ſo that the dull, ſleepy, and formal performances of holy duties, diſcover a man void of grace, as well as groſs impieties: Not onely prophaneneſs and ungodlineſs abroad, but dull, lazie, and formal duties, and that in a conſtant manner, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a man devoid of this work of Grace: Oh if this were in the depth of thee, in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> midſt of thee, it would break out more vigorouſly then it doth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Where this deep work of grace is, there a mans inward thoughts and meditations are often about holy things:</hi> The tree that is deeply rooted, hath ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <note place="margin">2.</note> ſtrings, as it were, whereby its faſtned to the earth; as the yong infant in the womb is to the mother: So that thou art to obſerve, what thy inward thoughts, thy inward meditations do moſt run about: If grace be deep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, thy ſoul will be like an heaven, ſuch holy thoughts, holy meditations, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affections do lodge in thee: Thus the godly is deſcribed, <hi>By meditating in the Law of God day and night,</hi> Pſal. 1. 2. As the Pſalmiſt deſcribes the wicked man, by his thoughts, <hi>God is not in his thoughts;</hi> and <hi>his inward thought is to leave himſelf a greet name.</hi> Thoughts are the firſt born of the ſoul, they moſt diſcover what a man is, they come neareſt to the fountain. As the liquor taſtes and ſmells of the veſſel, ſo thoughts have either filthineſs or godlineſs in them, as they come immediately from the heart; Oh then conſider, what thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward thoughts for the moſt part are, for ſuch art thou as they are.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>A man that hath this deep grace, he is will rooted and eſtabliſhed;</hi> he is upon the rock Chriſt, and ſo he can abide all temptations: If there come <note place="margin">3.</note> the temptations of perſecution, he can ſhew his patience; if of error and hereſies, his godly wiſdom and ſoundneſs of minde: When men want a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, or are not built upon a rock, they are like children toſſed up and down with every wind of Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe of Examination:</hi> This Doctrine ſhould even amaze you, and put you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> a godly fear; for do not moſt men content themſelves with the externals in Religion? is not all the whole worſhip and godlineſs of many in the meer form? others place it in diſputes, in opinions; but to have grace in the inward man is rare: Oh conſider that place, <hi>Every mans way is good in his own eyes, but God pondereth the heart,</hi> Prov. 21. 22. And God is often deſcribed by this, <hi>He tryeth and ſearcheth the hearts of men:</hi> Not that theſe outward duties of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Worſhip are to be neglected; but we are not to judge of godlineſs in our ſelves by theſe; the ſoul and excellency of them lieth in the inward man: Oh remember, that if there be not a good treaſure within, thou wilt roar and tremble one day, when all things elſe will fail. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> comforted himſelf in this, <hi>That he had walked in truth and uprightneſs of heart:</hi> Then ſomething with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, will be a joy to thy ſoul, even then, when all outward things will leave thee.</p>

                  <p>THe precious and great mercy of converſion promiſed in this Text under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Titles and Notions, hath been fully conſidered of and improved. There remain ſeveral other particulars, which are not without their great weight and moment. As in the firſt place, The Order and Method of the promiſe is to be taken notice of; for he worketh in the ſame method as he promiſeth: the Method is this: Firſt, He promiſeth to give the inward root, then the fruit; firſt the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, then the ſtreams: He firſt promiſeth the inward principles, and habit of grace, a new heart, a new ſpirit, and then he will cauſe them to walk in his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. God is both the Author of Nature, and the Author of grace; now as the Author of Nature, he firſt worketh the principles of life, he giveth the principles of Motions, and all vital Actions, and afterwards the exerciſe. So it is here, God doth in the way of grace beſtow a ſupernatural principle upon men, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Obſ.</hi> Gods method is firſt to give the inward principles of holineſs, and then grace to live holily. The point il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated by ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. 1.

                  <p>
                     <hi>That God doth firſt work the foundations and principles of holineſſe, and from them men walk and live holily.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We are his workmanſhip, created to every good work,</hi> Eph 2. 10. We do not firſt do good works, and ſo become Gods workmanſhip; but we are firſt his workmanſhip, and then we exerciſe our ſelves in good and holy works.</p>
                  <p>This Doctrine hath its great uſe, both in matter of information, and exhortation; and there is more conſequence in it, then an ordinary apprehenſion will at firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. Therefore to clear this, we will firſt illuſtrate this Truth, by the oppoſite of it, or contrary opinions.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, <hi>Grace doth not come at firſt into the heart, as ſin came into the world;</hi> for <hi>Adam</hi> was not made a bad tree, and ſo brought forth bad fruit; his perſon was not made wicked, and his nature, and then that infected his Actions; but God made
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:30767:295"/>
him after his own image, in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe: So that his ſoul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing furniſhed with all graces, as the heavens are adorned with ſeveral ſtars, he might have continued in all holy actions ſutable to his original perfection. <hi>Adams</hi> ſinful diſobedience, did not as outs, flow from a polluted unclean nature, but from the meer liberty of his will: and when he had thus actually tranſgreſſed, then that act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall ſin infected, and poiſoned his whole nature. Thus you ſee the actions of ſinne were before the habits, and principles of ſin: there was a branch before a root; there was a ſweet fountain, and yet a bitter ſtream<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> but God in converting and changing of us, doth take the contrary courſe; he firſt ſanctifieth our Natures, all the faculties of the ſoul; layeth a ſpiritual life as a foundation, and then being thus inwardly enlivened and eſtabliſhed, we are carried out to all holy actions: So that all the glorious outward actions of religion, that are viſible to the eyes of the world; if they be built without this inward foundation they will prove but a Babel: They are but like <hi>Sodoms</hi> apples, glorious for ſhew, but indeed duſt and Aſhes. It is good to obſerve, How that God in the Creation of the world, both in vegetative, and ſenſitive creatures, ſtill created the principles firſt, and that in perfection, Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, able to beget and propagate others; and thus it is alſo in converſion, he work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth theſe holy and excellent principles, which afterwards are operative and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God working thus a new Nature, and thereby enabling to new acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <note place="margin">2. God takes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other kind of courſe to make holy, then the Philoſopher teaches.</note> 
                     <hi>takes a far other courſe to make holy, then Moral Philoſophy teacheth:</hi> For if we read all the Moral Philoſophers, perſwading us to be temperate, juſt, or prudent, if you ask them, How ſhall we come to have the habits of theſe things? They will tell you, by frequent actions, <hi>juſta agendo ſumus juſti,</hi> by doing many righteous actions frequently, ſo we come to have habits. Thus they know no other way, and there is no better Divinity in moſt people; for they think by doing godly actions, they are made godly: and ſo they think by walking in Gods commandments, to get a new ſpirit, which is the clear inverted order to the Text; for God firſt giveth this New ſpirit, and then cauſeth to walk in his Law; we indeed are commanded to be diligent in the uſe of the means; we muſt attend to the Ordinances of grace; but till this ſpiritual life be infuſed, there is not one good action done by us in a good manner: All that thou doſt till this new principle be put in thee, hath but the body of a good action, not the ſoul of it.

But they ſay, that man by the power of Free-will, doth joyn with the grace of God, and co-operate with that; and ſo partly from free-will, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from Gods grace, comes this new ſpirit, this new grace. But this doth directly contradict many places of Scripture, which makes Regeneration and a New-birth neceſſarily to go before all holy actions; and if a man cannot make himſelf a man, much leſſe like God, as grace doth: But ſay they, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 31. there the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Make ye a new heart, a new ſpirit;</hi> Therefore we by our working
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:30767:296"/>
obtain a new heart; But this is anſwered thus, That the ſame thing may be both our Duty and Gods Gift: when the Scripture ſaith, <hi>Make ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>a new ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> there it declareth our Duty, what we ought to do: but when God ſaith, <hi>I will give it you,</hi> that ſhews our Impotency, we are not able to make new hearts; and therefore God graciouſly worketh it for us. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably and orthodoxly defend this truth, That we were not made holy by doing holy Actions, through Grace and Free-will; but God firſt made us holy; as ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> The Wheel runs round, not to make it ſelf round, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is round, therefore it runneth round. Indeed our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Make the Tree good (Matth. 12. 33.) and then the fruit will be good;</hi> but he doth not there deſcribe our power, but that excellent order all ſhould look unto in Religion; the Phariſees, like moſt people in our dayes, they looked to the outward Actions, did not dare to omit them, <hi>They waſhed the outſide of the Cup;</hi> but ſaith our Saviour, <hi>not the outſide but the inſide muſt be firſt cleanſed:</hi> The Tree muſt be firſt made good ere the fruit can. Oh there is no Doctrine more neceſſary then this. Who looketh to good inſides! Many dare not neglect the outward Obedience unto Gods Commandments, but who mindes the new heart, the new ſpirit within; and hence they ſet moſt prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterouſly upon the work of Converſion; they think by good Deeds, by out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Duties to obtain a new ſpirit from God, not conſidering this is to build the top of an Houſe before a Foundation be laid, <hi>Non per opera venitur ad fidem, ſed per fidem ad opera;</hi> We do not come to Faith by Works, but to Works by Faith; Oh then be affected with this excellent Order and Method that God takes in our Converſion, beginne where God beginneth. What the Apoſtle ſaid about his Preaching, <hi>As a wiſe Builder</hi> (1 Cor. 3. 10.) <hi>I lay a good Foundation:</hi> So do thou as a wiſe Builder for Heaven lay a good Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; Tempeſts and Stormes will ariſe; God will have his windes and waves to aſſault you, ſo that unleſſe you be built on a Rock, you cannot continue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things premiſed, let us conſider the Reaſons why God takes this <note place="margin">Reaſons of the point.</note> order, firſt giving a new heart and ſpirit, then cauſing us to walk in his wayes, and</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Otherwiſe our Duties would be dead Duties, there would be no Life in</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                     <hi>them.</hi> If a Ball or Wheel move, this Motion is not a vital Action, becauſe its not from a Principle within, it comes wholly from without; ſo all thy Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Gods Commandments is but a dead Obedience, a dead Work, if this new Heart be not firſt in thee. God in the Old Teſtament accepted of dead Sacrifices to be offered to him, but now we muſt give up our ſelves, as li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Sacrifices, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 1. The Scripture delights to call the Work of Grace, a Life, and the Graces of Gods Spirit are compared to living Waters. And thus indeed it is, Every Prayer muſt be a living Prayer, thy Obedience living, or lively Obedience, but this cannot be till God beginne in the inward man firſt. As therefore thou canſt not delight in a dead Wife, dead Children; ſo neither doth God in thy dead Religion. We Miniſters while preaching of theſe things, may ſay our Hearts are inditing of good things, and our Mouths drop like the Honey-comb; for how glad ſhouldſt thou be to hear of a way that may put life into all thy dead Duties. If thoſe that lived in Chriſts time, did ſo exceedingly rejoyce to receive their Friends from the dead; what joy ſhould it be to have all thy Duties ariſe as it were from the dead? How neceſſary is this for ſuch who live in a meer formall cuſtomary way of Duties! We read of the <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Plague, that the firſt-born in every Family was dead; and thereupon in the Morning there were great out-cryes in every Family for a dead ſon. Oh how ſhould this truth make many Families mourn for their dead Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, their dead Religion! There is no life in any thing thou doſt, till God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin within and ſo cure thee outwardly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="541" facs="tcp:30767:296"/>
Secondly, <hi>As there is no life in thy Duties, ſo there is no worth, no excellency, up</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>ſolidity in them, if firſt Gods Law be not written in our inward parts.</hi> We reade in the <hi>Canticles</hi> of large commendations that Chriſt gives the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> every godly ſoul, and how her graces are commended for the lovelineſſe, ſweetneſſe and fragrancy in them; whereas if ſhe had only paintings, a meer outſide with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the inward ſubſtance of Grace, there might have been ſome glittering but no true worth. What worth is there in an Image of clay and dirt, though co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over with gold? Godlineſſe is <hi>aurea</hi> not <hi>deaurata;</hi> the Churches Glory was within: What worth is there in ſtraws or flowers, when their juyce and moiſture is dried up? The hypocrite is compared in his faſtings to a Bulruſh, and ſuch a Bulruſh is every mans Godlineſſe without this inward foundation; its empty and light. Therefore weigh your Duties in the balance of the Sanctuary, do not judge that godlineſſe and holineſſe which the Scripture rejects as refuſe. As the Prophet ſpeaks of the <hi>Iſraelites, Reprobate Silver ſhall men call them, Jer.</hi> 6. 10. So reprobate Duties, a reprobate Godlineſſe, ſhall both men and God call theſe. As God by the Prophet complains of his defective and deformed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, <hi>Go and offer ſuch to your Governours and Rulers;</hi> ſo we may ſay in this caſe, Go to men and ſerve them without an inward heart, without inward affections, and will they thank you or reward ſuch ſervice?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>As there is no worth, ſo there is no ſutableneſſe in ſuch Duties to God;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> for God is a Spirit, and he ſearcheth and trieth the hearts of men, our Saviour from this conſideration inferred, that thoſe who worſhip him muſt worſhip him in ſpirit and truth, <hi>John</hi> 4. Now then if God have not begun this foundation in thee of a new heart, a new ſpirit; here is no congruity between God and thy worſhip. Oh how remote are theſe things from the common underſtanding of moſt men, who know no further in Religion then a bodily praying, or a bodily hearing! <hi>Surſum corda,</hi> was the ancient acclamation at the adminiſtration of the Sacrament, to take them off from the Elements of Bread and Wine; and this ſhould be a daily <hi>Memento,</hi> Lift up your hearts on high in every Duty you go about. But men that would be thus elevated in their hearts, and faſten upon God himſelf, muſt go out of all their low and bodily apprehenſions. As God bad <hi>Abraham</hi> come out of his Tabernacle, and then to look up to Heaven to number the Stars if he could; thou muſt be drawn out of the Tabernacle of thy bodily affections, before thou canſt ſet thy heart upon God himſelf. Oh then conſider that as long as this new ſpirit is not in thee, there is no more proportion between God and thy ſoul for any holy Duty, which is nothing but a familiar communion with God, then is between Earth and Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Therefore God begins here before the outward man be ſanctified, becauſe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>the greateſt power and ſtrength of corruption lieth in the inward parts.</hi> As the Law of God is in the inward parts of the godly; ſo the Law of ſinne, as the Apoſtle calleth it, is reigning in the members of every wicked man; ſo that the godly have a good Law in their inward parts, and the wicked, the Law of ſinne. If therefore God ſhould only inable us to outward Obedience without this new ſpirit, his greateſt work of Grace would be left undone; for its not the body ſo much as the ſoul that the Devil poſſeſſeth, and taketh for his own. The great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of wickedneſs lieth there, where moſt men do neither perceive or feel it. Though ſickneſs when it come to the heart be preſently felt, yet ſinne when it cometh to the heart, and lieth at the heart, is not felt as a burden till Gods Spirit convince a man; ſeeing therefore that this converting Grace is vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed as an healing, and a medicinal cure, it is neceſſary that the greateſt operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it ſhould be upon the vital parts within. So that as in unregenerate men, the imaginations of the thoughts of their hearts are only evil, and that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually; ſo the imagination of their thoughts ſhould be godly and heavenly. As the wicked ſwallow down iniquity like water, ſo rivers of living water ſhould flow out of their bowels. As in the wicked no man can bring the clean out of an
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:30767:297"/>
unclean, ſo it ſhould be hard to bring an unclean from a clean. In theſe things lieth the marrow and quinteſſence of Religion, men are but in the porch, and never enter into the Holy of Holies till they be experimentally acquainted with theſe things: O that all our Congregations were underſtanding of theſe things. If Miniſters preach againſt outward groſſe impieties, ſuch as the light of nature condemneth, with that you can go along; but concerning this new ſpirit and new heart, or the old heart and old man; which the Scripture ſo much ſpeaks of, you know nothing of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the next place let us conſider, What are the Signs that may diſcover when we</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Signs to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver when Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties proceed from this new Spirit within, and not from other grounds.</note> 
                     <hi>perform holy Duties from this new Spirit within, and not rather as moſt do from Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Cuſtom or carnal Reſpects to the good or ill will of man.</hi> For this is certain, All men perform holy Duties, either from inward principles of Grace, or out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward principles of humane reſpects; now how ſhall we know when a man doth them from this inward new Spirit?</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He that doth them from an inward principle; <hi>is conſtant, and uniform, and immoveable in them, for this is made a divine Nature in him.</hi> Now as all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <note place="margin">1.</note> principles in the creatures do carry them on in a conſtant ſetled way; The fire doth alwayes aſcend upwards, the ſtone deſcend downwards; ſo the wicked man he is conſtant to his principles of ſinne, you ſhall never finde him check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſtopping himſelf, but by ſome extraordinary power; Thus the godly man, his heart and ſoul doth carry him on to the things of Godlineſs, and if he be at any time ſtopped in it, or hindered, it is, as they ſay the diſeaſe is to the body, <hi>Praeter Naturam,</hi> beſides the nature and inclination of a godly man. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> makes ſuch a miſerable complaint of thoſe luſts that did ſtirre, and move in him, as thoſe that had led him away Captive againſt his will, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. Look to this then you who are inconſtant, and are for holy Duties in ſome fits, in ſome ſad moods. So that it is accidental, and wholly inexpected, if thou ſet upon any religious Duty, we may by way of wonder cry out, is they did, <hi>Is Saul alſo among the Prophets?</hi> What makes thee pray, come to Church? What putteth thee in this fit? What good Diſpoſition art thou in ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Men that perform outward Obedience from inward principles, they do</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>it with delight and joy.</hi> There is nothing ſo pleaſing and connatural to them. All principles have a kinde of delight in their connatural actions and objects. Thus the voluptuous principle is for the pleaſures of the fleſh, the ambitious prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple for honours and earthly greatneſs, and the godly principle is for holineſſe and godlineſs. <hi>David</hi> how often doth he profeſs his delights, and even raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Ordinances of God, and the enjoying of him! Chriſt called it <hi>His meat and drink to do the will of his Father;</hi> and why? becauſe the Law of God was written within his heart. Indeed the godly ſometimes finde dulneſſe, liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs, and even a weariſomneſs upon them in the wayes of God. But yet their main and chief delight of ſoul is in God and the Ordinances that lead to him, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then in any thing elſe; <hi>Thou haſt put more gladneſſe into my heart, then they have had, when their wine and oyl increaſeth,</hi> Pſal. 4.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Where inward Principles are, they will carry to the Obedience of Gods Commands, though there be no outward Encouragements to allure and draw on.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> The Father and Mother love their Children, though they have no outward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages by them, becauſe it is a natural principle. You do not hire and intreat an hungry man to eat his meat, or a wearied man to take his reſt. Natural appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite cals for theſe things. Thus he that hath the new heart and ſpirit within him, he is godly, and liveth holily, though there be no favour, no encouragement, no honour to ſuch men.</p>
                  <p>Yea fourthly, <hi>Where inward Principles of Grace are, They grow the more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuller and active, by how much the more they are oppoſed.</hi> Thus the water that is <note place="margin">4.</note> ſtopt doth ſwell the higher. The colder the weather is, the hotter the fire burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:30767:297"/>
by an oppoſition; And ſo the people of God have been moſt holy in times of Troubles, and Oppoſitions: They have born the beſt fruit, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked moſt green in the Winter time: whereas when men have not inward prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of grace, then they preſently wither as ſoon as the Sunne riſeth; becauſe they have no root. The godly are Stars, that ſhine moſt in the night, in dark times.</p>
                  <p>Uſe of <hi>Exhortation,</hi> Still and ſtill to look from whence all thy externall Obedience comes. Whence is thy Hearing, thy Praying, thy Family Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> Yea, what advantage is it to ſet up <hi>Dagon?</hi> he will fall down again and again; as long as he hath no inward life in him, and it will be no profit to thee, or Comfort at thy Death, or at the day of Judgement, to ſay, I have prayed, I have heard, I have been diligent to come to Church; if firſt this new Spirit have not been put in thee. But Oh! How long ſhall thoſe things be dark Parables, and hidden Myſteries to moſt men? Who will give you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in theſe things? Remember your inwards of Nature decay every day, and your outward body; lay up then ſome enduring Treaſure.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That whereſoever God works the principles of Grace within, there they cannot but</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That there are many in the world, who flatter and bleſſe themſelves with the goodneſſe of their heart, when yet their lives are full of noiſome luſts.</hi> You would wonder men ſhould be ſo bewitched; and yet how often is it? Take the prophane man, and the moſt ungodly wretch that is, yet he will ſay, He hath as good an heart as the beſt of men; not conſidering how impoſſible it is to devide a good heart, and a good life one from another. As men doe not gather Grapes of Thorns, nor Figs of Thiſtles: ſo neither can Thorns be gathered from Grapes, or Thiſtles from Figs. As we cannot expect a clean thing from an unclean; ſo neither an unclean thing from a clean: ſo that the lives and conſtant wicked actions of moſt men, doe declare it to their faces, that there is no new heart or ſpirit within them: and as there are ſuch kind of Self-Deceivers: ſo there are another ſort of Perſons, called <hi>Nicodemites,</hi> ſuch who thought they might lawfully communicate in any raiſe or Idolatricall Worſhip, or might deny the outward profeſſion of the truth of Chriſt, if ſo be that they kept their Conſcience clear to God. This grievous error did much prevail when the outward profeſſion of Chriſt and his Truth was accompanyed with great and imminent dangers: they thought they might give up their bodies to any outward pollution: ſo that they kept their ſouls for God; but God will be glorified in ſoul and in body alſo, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 20. And as we muſt with the heart believe, ſo we muſt with the mouth make Confeſſion to ſalvation. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 10.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Even in the godly, the heart many times may be deſirous of that good</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>which yet through the power of corruption they are not alwayes able to perform.</hi> So that although a new heart be within them, yet much corruption, and many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may be in their life <hi>Rom. 7. Paul</hi> exceedingly groaned under this miſerie, <hi>That the good he would do, he could not do;</hi> and although out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh, yet the mouth cannot ſpeak all the abundance of the heart: There is more ſtrength of Grace in the heart then poſſibly can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed outwardly. As no child can expreſſe how much it loveth its father; ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any ſoul manifeſt how much it loveth God. Howſoever therefore a new heart is in the godly, yet becauſe it is not perfectly and abſolutely new, it faileth in many outward performances; ſome outward or inward temptations make it come ſhort of the grace it deſireth. Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>The Spirit and the fleſh lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth one againſt another, ſo that ye cannot doe the things ye would,</hi> Gal. 5. 17. A god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man then muſt judge wiſely concerning himſelf; they are ready to think, Oh if Grace were in my heart, if the ſpirit of God did dwell in me, how could I be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with paſſions, with dulneſſe and ſluggiſhneſſe; they muſt remember, that though the ſpirit be willing the fleſh is often weak; yea many times both ſpirit and fleſh alſo may be weak: But why doe we ſpeak of this as a ſtrange thing? That where the Principles of Grace are men may fail in outward duties; for ſometimes we ſee where they have been, yet foul and groſſe ſins have been committed, yea and for ſome ſeaſon continued in. <hi>David</hi> had the Spirit of God within; yet in his Murder and Adultery he did not walk in the Lords Statutes; and ſo of divers others! So that we muſt not abſolutely condemn thoſe as hypocrites, and without any true principles of grace, who living after a godly manner, yet ſometimes fall in the mire, and tumble in bloud: for although ſuch a condition is very terrible, and greatly ſcandalous; yet the ſeeds and inward principles of grace are not quite extinct; and therefore when we ſay, A godly heart, and a godly life are neceſſarily conjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together, that is to be underſtood for the moſt part, and according to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, though accidentally, through ſuddain temptations, the clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary may appear.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>There may be inward principles of Grace, and yet no outward fruits of</hi>

                     <hi>righteouſneſſe:</hi> When either the ſubjects are not capable of actions, or they have not time and opportunity to produce them; No doubt but in Infants that are ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, the inward principles of grace are infuſed, and therefore they are made Members of Chriſt: yet as they have a ſoul, but that ſoul cannot put forth any actions of reaſon; ſo they have the principles of grace, but they bud not forth into fruit. The Thief alſo that was Converted at the laſt hour, there was a new ſpirit in him, yet he had not time to bring forth the fruits of righteouſneſſe: ſo that it is one thing not to bring forth the fruits of righteouſneſſe, becauſe there is no inward root within; and another thing, becauſe there wants an opportunity, or the objects about which ſuch graces are exerciſed are not preſent. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of the Saints care and love to him, excuſeth them, becauſe though they were ready to doe good to him, yet they wanted an opportunity, <hi>Phil,</hi> 4. 10. A godly man is indeed a tree that is planted by the waters ſide, and brings forth its fruit, but it is in due ſeaſon. Though Chriſt curſed the Fig-tree, that had no fruit on it, although it was not the ſeaſon; yet hereby (haply) he would admoniſh the <hi>Iewes,</hi> of how much ſorer curſe they have cauſe to be afraid, who had the ſeaſon of grace, but neglected it.</p>
                  <p>A Godly man therefore ought not to be dejected, if he doe not abound in ſuch plentiful exerciſes of graces as others doe, if his minde be willing: Onely he hath not ſuch opportunities, nor ſuch Inſtruments, whereby to make his light ſhine before others, as many of the Children of God have.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, conſider this, <hi>Although a conſtant practice of ungodlineſſe be a ſure demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>of a graceleſs heart, yet a conſtant abſtinence from groſſe ſins, is not preſently a ſure evidence of a good heart.</hi> Underſtand this, that thou do not deceive thy ſoul; for many think, if they indeed ſhould wallow in the Mire and Filth of ſinne, it were ſure they were beaſtly Swine; but becauſe they keep themſelves clean from the groſſe Tranſgreſſions of the wicked, therefore they conclude this new heart is within them: but you have heard that men may be reſtrained from ſin, by the providence of God and otherwayes, who yet have not this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall life infuſed in them. For this Spirit of God doth not onely cauſe a man to forbear from ſinne, but in ſuch a manner alſo, and upon ſuch grounds, that the moſt painted Sepulcher, the moſt exact Formaliſt can never reach unto. Theſe things laid as a foundation, it is good to conſider, why a man cannot carry this coal of fire, this principle of grace in his boſome, but it will break out into a flame. And,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The reaſon is evident from the nature of Grace,</hi> or this new heart within <note place="margin">Reaſ 1.</note> men, its of an operative, and ſpirituall vigor, it will not let a man alone, he can have no reſt, or quiet within himſelf, if he ſhould not outwardly practiſe that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, the root whereof is in his heart. Hence the principles of grace are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to active and vigorous things, to ſeed ſowen, which though little in quantity, yet is great in efficacie: Thus <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>A man born of God, doth not, nor can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſin, becauſe immortall ſeed abideth in him,</hi> 1 John 3. 9. And ſo the Word of God received by faith in the heart, is compared to ſeed ſowen, that brings forth much fruit. Thus <hi>Ieremy</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> when they were withheld ſometimes from good, they felt a fire kindled in their breaſts that burnt and ſcorched them, and could not but ſpeak: So the <hi>Apoſtle, We believe, therefore we ſpeak,</hi> 2 Cor. 4. 13. And grace is compared to a Fountain of living waters, always ſpringing out of the belly of the Godly, <hi>John 7. 38. The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us,</hi> ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. This is the new Wine that the Spirit of God puts into the Converted, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are heartned, and cheered within. O then be afraid of thy negligence, careleſneſſe, and neglect of an holy life! If grace were like ſeed, like fire within, it would ſet thy whole converſation on a flame. Now grace in the heart muſt needs be a ſharp Arrow to wound ſinne, ſeeing that it is in the hand of Chriſt, and the ſpirit of God; ſo that it cannot but conquer ſin in the life, ſeeing Chriſt and his
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:30767:299"/>
ſpirit dwels in thoſe that are his. <hi>Greater is he that is with you, then he that is againſt you,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. 4. And though Satan be the ſtrong man, that keeps all things in quiet, before converſion, yet Chriſt is ſtronger. No wonder then, if grace in the heart reſt not, till it reformeth the life, and ſubdueth the moſt ſtrong corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in a man; for Chriſt and his Spirit ſets theſe on working: and therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If they be led by the Spirit, they ſhall not fulfill the deeds of the fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5. <hi>And ſin ſhall not have dominion over them, becauſe they are under grace,</hi> Rom. 6. 14. So that as the houſe of <hi>Saul</hi> did wax daily weaker and weaker, and the houſe of <hi>David</hi> ſtronger and ſtronger, becauſe God had forſaken the one, and was with the other; Thus it muſt needs be, that a new heart will make a new life, becauſe the new heart hath God on its ſide, Chriſt and his ſpirit is with it. We may ſee the Combate of ſin and grace excellently repreſented in the Iſraelites fighting with the Canaanites, how wonderfully did they ſubdue all their enemies! no adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, though they were of the moſt terrible Gyants, were able to ſtand before them: ſo its here in Converſion: No ſinne, though never ſo pleaſant, ſo ſweet, ſo powerfull, is able to ſtand before the ſpirit of God, Crucifying the deeds of the fleſh; and therefore let none excuſe themſelves, ſaying: Such a ſinne, or ſuch diſtempers I cannot overcome, I am not able to maſter ſuch infirmities: Why ſaiſt thou ſo? for grace inlivened by Gods Spirit, is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all thy ſtouteſt corruptions; Though they be too ſtrong for thee, yet not for him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>A new heart within, muſt needs have an outward godly life, becauſe that is the end and the perfection of it.</hi> In Morall Philoſophy, acts are accounted the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection <note place="margin">2.</note> and end of their Habits; and they uſe to ſay, That power is in vain, which is never reduced into act: and thus it holds in Religion: God gives us the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and inward abilities of grace; that they may be in action and exerciſe. Hence God requires actions principally, and the inward principles by conſequence. Thus God requires the act of Faith, and the act of Love: <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord,</hi> viz. <hi>actually:</hi> So that all inward principles of grace being for this end, to be in outward action and exerciſe, it cannot be that they ſhould be fruſt rated of this; yea in the Scripture to have a Talent, and actually to improve it, is all one; and they are ſaid to receive the grace of God in vain, who do not put it forth in exerciſe; ſo that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry godly man, who is not diligent in the daily exerciſe of grace ſhould conſider, Why God hath given him the principles of grace, why a power to believe, a power to be heavenly-minded, when this is not demonſtrated in his life: and all thoſe who live in groſſ: impieties, yet boaſt of a good heart, may conclude they have a good heart in vain; for a good heart is to have a good life, eſpecially the people of God, who have indeed the principles of grace, yet walk dully and negligently they ſhould ſtartle at this ſaying, Have I received all my grace in vain? hath God wrought all theſe great works in me in vain? How ſevere was that ſervants Maſter to him, who took his Talent, and hid it in a Napkin! Even as they buried their dead, tying them in Napkins, <hi>Caſt that unprofitable Servant</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>into utter darkneſſe,</hi> Mat. 25. 30. Not profuſe, deceitfull, thieviſh, but unprofitable ſervant. Maiſt thou not fear this doom, thou who happily hoſt enjoyed the principles of grace within thee, but thy outward life is like a barren wilderneſſe. Stir up thy ſelf therefore and ſay, All principles of Grace are to act with, are to be daily exerciſed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, therefore principles of Grace within will demonſtrate themſelves in a godly life, <hi>Becauſe God at the day of judgement will make our actions and works the meaſure of his judgment.</hi> The judiciall proceſſe will not be according to what is <note place="margin">3.</note> within, but what is without. Thus <hi>Paul, We muſt all appear before the judgment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat of Christ, to receive according to what we have done in the fleſh,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 10. <hi>whether good or evill,</hi> Why then haſt thou any hope, who liveſt in all manner of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe? Think not the cry of thy prayers, nor the groans of thy heart will be
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:30767:299"/>
above thy crying ſins: At that great day God will not onely enquire what thy thoughts, or thy deſires have been, but what thy actions have been. If therefore any grain of wiſdome be in thee, thou wilt be ſure to look to that againſt which the Judge will moſt ſurely manifeſt himſelf, and that is thy actions. It will be then no plea to ſay, Lord I had a good heart, a good meaning, I deſired to doe other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wile; if thou haſt not indeed done otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The Scripture doth expreſſely declare ſuch to be Hypocrites,</hi> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a profeſſion of Chriſt, and of faith and love of him, do yet rowl themſelves <note place="margin">4.</note> in all impieties: <hi>Let every one that nameth the name of Chriſt, depart from iniquity,</hi> 2 Tim, 2. 19. And the wicked mans Sacrifice, the wicked mans prayer is an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination unto the Lord: the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> doth at large vehemently preſſe this, That Faith without the good Fruits and works of Righteouſnes is altogether dead, and he calls that man a vain man, who reaſons otherwiſe. Thou then who are ſo apt to brand thoſe who endeavour to walk ſtrictly, and in an unſported manner from the world, with hypocriſie; ſee thy ſelf the moſt notorious hypocrite of all; for thou ſayeſt, Thou believeſt in Chriſt, thou ſayeſt thou loveſt God, and yet thy life is full of prophaneneſſe, and enmity to his holy will: Sincerity is the ſweet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord and harmony of the heart, and actions together; and it is hypocriſie to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend heart and affections for God, when with thy works thou doſt deny him. As the Prophets of old complained of ſuch, who would come into Gods Temple, call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Name, yet curſe, ſwear, ſteal, and commit Adultery, <hi>Ier.</hi> 7. With no leſſe zeal may the Miniſters of the Goſpel complain, That men will be Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, will come to Church, will hear, and yet their lives are full of ſuch noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſins.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, <hi>Therefore Grace in the heart will break out into action, becauſe the godly</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>are to endeavour the converſion of others.</hi> They are to be examples of holineſſe, to win others thereunto: now this can never be without holineſs in the life: For men cannot trie, or diſcern the hearts of men, they judge of the tree by the fruits; ſo that if ever we would be inſtruments to reclaim others from a wicked life, we our ſelves muſt be exemplarie in our own: Thus <hi>the believing wife is exhorted to walk in ſuch an holy manner, that her unbelieving husband may be brought to the faith thereby,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 16. Our Saviour exhorts his Diſciples, <hi>That their light ſhould ſo ſhine before men, that they beholding their good works, may glorifie God in the day of their viſitation,</hi> Mar. 5. 16. Oh what a ſad thing is it for thee by thy wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly life to harden others in impiety! They ſee that, a rich man, a great man, a wiſe man, ſcoffing and oppoſing the way of godlineſſe, and this confirmeth them the more in their impieties.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, Therefore the Spirit of God within, will cauſe us to walk in all holineſs, <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>Becauſe the daily exerciſe of Grace affords a great deal of ſweetneſſe, comfort, and a good aſſurance of our intereſt in Chriſt.</hi> Though good works and and a godly life are not a cauſe of our juſtification or ſanctification, yet by theſe we come to have comfortable evidences of Gods love to us, and ours to him. As <hi>Leah</hi> ſaid, <hi>Her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band would love her, becauſe ſhe was fruitful in children;</hi> and thus it is here, Our Election is made ſure to us, by adding one grace to another, one godly action to another: Barrenneſſe in the knowledge of God is reckoned a great curſe by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter, 2 Pet.</hi> 1. 8. and hence it is, that the more Gods own children fail in a daily and diligent practice of Godlineſſe, the leſſe comfort and aſſurance they have in their own Conſciences.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, principles of grace, wil have the acts of grace, <hi>that ſo they may ſtop the mouths of all thoſe who would reproach and blaspheme the holy profeſſion of his Goſpel. David</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">7.</note> by his wicked action of murder, had opened the mouths of Gods enemies to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme him: And the Apoſtle complaineth, <hi>Rom. 2. That by their ungodlineſſe, the Name of God was blaſphemed among the Gentiles.</hi> Oh then, if nothing elſe, yet let this make thy heart and life accord in the power of Godlineſſe, that the name of God may not be blaſphemed, that his pure honour may not be wounded.</p>

Of Inſtruction: How vainly all thoſe do comfort themſelves, who plead duties or opinions, or any high thing in Religion, whoſe lives are not cleanſed: Its a vain thing to plead the ſpirit of God in thee, if that cauſe thee not to walk in Gods ſtatutes, and to do his judgments; yet this hath been, and is a great deceit; men think duties, and external acts of Religion are enough to ſave them, though their lives be full of noiſome filthineſſe.</p>

                  <p>THe method that the Spirit of God uſeth in promiſing theſe great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, hath afforded us profitable obſervations.</p>
                  <p>In the next place you may remember, that in the general diviſion of this Text, there was the grace of God vouchſafed <hi>in the root,</hi> and <hi>in the fruit;</hi> in the principles or habits, and in the actual exerciſe of grace. We have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſpatched grace in the root, in the principles, which is called <hi>A new heart,</hi> and, <hi>Gods ſpirit put into us:</hi> Let us now admire the goodneſs of God in the fruit; for the Text beareth both an holy root, and holy fruit; and this is expreſſed in this promiſe, <hi>I will cauſe them to walk in my ſtatutes:</hi> This is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="549" facs="tcp:30767:300"/>
cauſe us to walk in his ſtatutes:</hi> So that the former part of the promiſe, is for the principles of grace; this latter part, for the acts and exerciſe of grace. We read in Scripture, that <hi>David, Peter,</hi> and others, who had the inward princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of grace, yet for want of the actual exerciſe of them, did grievouſly wound their own ſouls, and ſadly diſhonor the name of God: So that here we have a ſpecial remarkable point afforded us, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That God doth not onely at firſt infuſe the principles of grace in his children, but</hi>

                     <hi>its neceſſary he ſhould alſo inable them to act and improve thoſe principles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He doth not onely give us power to holy actions, but he works alſo the holy actions themſelves: So that not onely the principles of Believing, Repentance, &amp;c. are the gift of God, but the very acts alſo of theſe graces: Thus the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That God worketh in us, not onely to will, but to do,</hi> Phil. 2. 13. not onely the power, but the action it ſelf. This point in the explication of it, will much manifeſt and exalt the grace of God as all in all; and then it will ſet forth the exact duty of Chriſtianity, whoſe glory lieth in the daily exerciſe of grace, not in the principles or root of it: And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>We will open the ſenſe of the Dostrine,</hi> and then prove it by ſeveral Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments; <note place="margin">1.</note> for <hi>Pelagians, Arminians,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Papiſts,</hi> are againſt this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and glorious truth, attributing indeed the ſufficiency and power of doing a good action, to Gods grace, but the actual efficacy of it to a mans will.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place therefore, conſider, that there is a twofold grace of God, as to <note place="margin">Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to open the ſenſe of this Doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>There is after this a quicking, preventing or exciting grace;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <note place="margin">2.</note> that former principle of grace is ſtirred up, and provoked to action. I ſhall not ſtrictly attend to the School diſtinctions of grace, Prevenient, Conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant, and Subſequent, of grace operant, and co-operant: I ſhall uſe the Scripture phraſe, <hi>Quickning Grace;</hi> which is not onely at firſt of men dead in ſin, and giving life unto them, in which ſenſe <hi>Paul</hi> uſeth it, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. but alſo for the exciting and ſtirring up thoſe principles of grace in us, both to act, and alſo to increaſe; as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119. prayeth many times, eſpecially <hi>verſe 88. Quicken me after thy loving kindeneſs, ſo ſhall I keep thy teſtimonies:</hi> This is a bleſſed temper, and happy are thoſe who do not by negligence, or any other ſin, provoke God to withdraw this exciting grace; for although a godly man looſe not his principles of grace, yet if he looſe this quickning, this acting of grace, he is for the preſent like a barren wilderneſs: So then you ſee, God hath a twofold grace, <hi>Initial</hi> and <hi>Converting, Exciting</hi> and <hi>Quickning,</hi> which we need every hour, every moment, and muſt pray for more earneſtly, then we would for our daily bread.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>You muſt know, that there is a great difference in man, while he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                     <hi>the one, and while God enableth him to the other:</hi> Theſe are not ſpeculative notional points, that tend not to edification, but are exceeding profitable; for if we conſider man as the ſubject of that firſt converting grace, ſo he is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſive, he doth not at all co-operate or work with the grace of God; for you heard, he had <hi>A ſtony heart,</hi> and he is <hi>dead in ſin;</hi> and grace converting, is compared to the <hi>Reſurrection:</hi> So that as <hi>Lazarus,</hi> when he was raiſed to life, did not contribute any help thereunto of himſelf, but was wholly paſſive; ſo it is in every man that is at firſt converted to God, he doth not further this great work, he doth not deſire, he doth not ſet it on; yea, he uſeth all the power and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance he can againſt it, till God conquer the heart by his Omnipotent power; but it is otherwiſe in this exciting and quickning grace, for there being the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural principles of grace before, when he is ſtirred up, he is not meerly paſſive; but being firſt acted by the grace of God, we then act &amp; move alſo; ſo that we are voluntary and free in thoſe exerciſes of grace; though grace moves, yet we alſo
<pb n="550" facs="tcp:30767:301"/>
move: This is excellently expreſſed by the Church, <hi>Draw us, and we will run after thee,</hi> Cant. 1. 4. The Church was liſtleſs, unprepared; therefore ſhe deſireth the grace of God to <hi>draw her, and then ſhe would run after him.</hi> Draw a dead man, and for all that he cannot run; but the Church had the life of grace in her, onely ſhe wanted this quickning, exciting grace.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When we ſay, <hi>That God doth not onely work the principles, but alſo</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>the acts of grace, that is to be underſtood as an efficient, not as a ſubject:</hi> So that although we ſay, God worketh in us our Faith, our Repentance, yet we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay God believeth, and God repenteth; for they came from him as an efficient meerly, but from us as ſubjects in a vital formal manner, <hi>Deus non poteſt ſupplere vicem formalis aut materialis cauſae:</hi> So that we are the formal cauſes, as well as the efficient. Even as God in the order of nature, worketh all natural actions for us, <hi>In him he we live and move,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; yet we cannot ſay, God liveth, or God moveth, or God eateth or God walketh; becauſe he is the efficient cauſe of theſe onely, not the formal.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Its clear, that God doth not onely give a new heart, but cauſe us alſo to walk in the ways of holineſs, becauſe theſe are two diſtinct mercies, and are very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable one from the other:</hi> It may be, and experience tells us, it doth too often fall out, that where the former mercy is of Gods ſpirit, and a new heart in his people, yet the latter may not be. <hi>David</hi> you heard, even while he committed thoſe foul and groſs ſins, yet had not the principle and ſeeds of Grace quite dead within him; no more then the tree in winter, that is ſtript of all its ornaments, is dead at the root; yet he was far from this latter mercy in the Text, <hi>To walk in the ſtatutes of God:</hi> And ſo at any time, when the children of God fall into ſins of luſts, or careleſneſs and negligence, they are not fallen from the Root Chriſt; but yet this exciting and quicking grace they have loſt for the preſent. Seeing therefore, that this latter is ſeparate from the former, and you may ſee even one of Chriſts ſheep for the time, wallowing like the Swine in filthy mire, it is neceſſary that God ſhould not onely do the one, but the other alſo for us: Therefore the people of God are to conſider this: pleaſe not your ſelves that you have had the experience of converſion upon your ſouls; you can tell, that God hath made a wonderful change in you; for how doth God accompany you with this exciting, acting grace? Are ye not all over ruſty, as it were, are you not very often unfit for holy duties, unprepared to hear, to pray? Are not your hearts like a barren mountain, yea, like a noiſom dunghill ſometimes? Do you not refuſe to open the door, that Chriſt may come in, who hath ſtood all night knocking at the door, while his locks are full of dew? Is it not thus, and far worſe with you many times, who yet hope of your converſion to God? And whence is all this? you have not this acting, this exciting grace, and ſo thou art like one in a deep ſleep.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The people of God have earneſtly begged for this acting grace, as not thinking the principles of grace enough:</hi> Thus <hi>David</hi> often, <hi>Quicken my heart, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>my heart</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to keep thy teſtimonies:</hi> That man prayed, <hi>That Chriſt would increaſe his faith;</hi> yea, all the prayers that you read any godly men have made for the acts of grace, that they might repent, believe, walk holily, all theſe do plainly convince, that God doth not onely give the life of grace, but the conſtant motions of that life afterward: So that if God did not work theſe exerciſes of grace for us alſo, it would be a vain thing to importune God in prayer for them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, God doth this latter, as well as the former, <hi>Becauſe he encourageth the godly to ſet upon the exerciſe of grace, becauſe he will inable them, and aſſiſt</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>them therein:</hi> Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling:</hi> Why? becauſe <hi>its God that worketh in you to will and to do:</hi> This argument may ſeem very ſtrange, <hi>Work, becauſe God worketh in you;</hi> but its the greateſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <note place="margin">Phil. 2 24.</note>
                     <pb n="551" facs="tcp:30767:301"/>
and comfort that can be: Do thou ſet thy ſelf upon the works of Faith, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, Mortification of the deareſt and ſtrongeſt corruption, though thou art apt to be diſcouraged, and ſaveſt, It cannot be, yet God is ready to help with his hand. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking of thoſe high expreſſions of grace, <hi>To know how to abound, and how to want,</hi> he addeth, <hi>I can do all things, through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me,</hi> Phil. 4. 13. A godly man hath a kinde of Omnipotency; he can do what God can do, becauſe he hath the help of God inabling him thereunto: A Chriſtian then ſhould not diſhearten himſelf with ſuch thoughts as theſe, What ſhall I do when death comes? What if ſuch ſuddain calamities ſhould overwhelm me? for he muſt remember, that God uſeth to put forth his hand at that time; and then <hi>Peter</hi> is imboldned to go upon the waters to Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, There muſt be ſuch acting and inlivening grace, as well as the principles, <hi>Becauſe otherwiſe God would loſe great part of his glory, in bringing a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>man to heaven:</hi> For not onely Juſtification, but Salvation is attributed unto Grace; and <hi>Rom. 9. Its not of him that willeth, or runneth, but of him that calleth and electeth:</hi> Now grace could not have the glory of all from the beginning to the end, if God ſhould not conſtantly inable and help in the progreſs of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, as well as at the beginning: So that if God did onely give principles of grace, and not daily aſſiſt and inable; we might indeed be thankful unto him for what once he did for us, but we might thank our own power, and ſacrifice to our own will for what is done afterwards: <hi>But what haſt thou,</hi> ſaith the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>that thou haſt not received?</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 7. Its a general aſſertion, <hi>Every good and perfect gift comes from the father of lights,</hi> James 1. and we cannot think a good thought, much leſs have any good affections or deſires, though already con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, of our ſelves, if grace were not always ready at hand: So that this truth ſhould put the ſoul into daily and conſtant thankfulneſs, becauſe it hath daily and conſtant ſupply from the throne of grace.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>If ſo be that in natural things, where God hath given natural princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of actions, yet they cannot act, without daily concourſe of God, how much more</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>muſt this hold in ſupernaturals:</hi> Take the fire, that is a natural Agent, and ſo determined to one action; <hi>viz.</hi> To burn, yet if God doth ſuſpend his influence, his actual motion, as in the example of the three Worthies, then it cannot burn; and this is much more ſeen in natural creatures: <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our being,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle; we do not onely live by him, but we are not able to move or ſtir without him. Now if it be not enough for a man to have God give him life once, but he muſt daily inable him to move and ſtir, will not this follow much more in ſupernatural things? Cannot we ſtir the hand or the foot without him? and can we ſtir the heart or affections to God without him? So that as God, though he did reſt from the works of Creation, yet he doth not from them of Conſervation: <hi>But hitherto,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>I and my father work:</hi> So neither in the ſpiritural new creature doth God ceaſe from daily conſervation, and conſtant help in all its actions.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, The <hi>Dominicans</hi> arguing againſt the Jeſuits in this point, reaſon thus, <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>Every thing that is potential, muſt be reduced into act, by ſome thing that is it ſelf in act:</hi> Now, ſay they, God he is <hi>Actus primus, &amp; purus,</hi> he is the firſt and pure act. The principles and habits of grace are potential, and therefore they muſt be determinated and actuated by God, who is always in act: This Argument hath much ſtrength in it, but it is too metaphyſical: I come to a more popular one; And</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, God doth not onely beſtow principles of grace, but alſo excites <note place="margin">7</note> and quickens, as is plainly evidenced, <hi>In that two godly men, living under the ſame means of grace, yet one doth not profit, but groweth colder and colder; the other groweth and thriveth more and more:</hi> How comes this difference to be? but that one hath the grace of God aſſiſting and inabling of him, the other hath not; not
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:30767:302"/>
that he who falls into ſin may blame God; for his ſlothfulneſs, negligence and careleſneſs, makes God to withdraw his helping hand in that need: So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the cauſe of one mans fall, is his own ſin: Yet the cauſe of the other mans ſtanding, is Gods grace vouchſafed unto him, yea, the ſame godly man: as <hi>David,</hi> findes a great change in his own heart: ſometimes he is able to truſt in God, to overcome temptations; at other times he is caſt down, and hath no ſtrength within him; Whence is all this? but from the ebbings and flowings of exciting grace: And this is a clear experimental demonſtration of this truth, At ſometimes the leaſt temptation, the leaſt ſnare, is ready to make a godly man fall; at another time, though ſtrong winds and tempeſts blow upon him, yet he is able to ſtand like Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> that cannot be removed. Now this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence comes not from within a man, but from without, as this aſſiſting and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing grace is ready, or afar off.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, let us conſider, how bleſſed and happy a thing it is, to have <note place="margin">What a bleſſed ſtate it is to have both theſe graces. 1.</note> not onely the principles of grace, but the actings and cauſations of it: And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Hereby the ſoul will be kept from negligence, dulneſs, and all abatements or falls in our love to God:</hi> All the while grace is thus cauſing thee to walk, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thee to be always doing, no dulneſs or ſtupidity will enter upon thee; all the while a man is in exerciſe and motion, he doth not take cold; all the while the ſtreams run, they cannot grow muddy: Now a godly man is ſaid <hi>To have Rivers of living water flowing from his belly;</hi> he is not a fountain ſealed up, they are daily flowing, and then they cannot grow noiſom; the iron that lieth ſtill groweth ruſty, and is not fit for uſe: Now what a comfortable condition is this to the godly, to have thy heart never lie ſtill, but always hungring, thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or moving after God and good things one way or other! As the heart it ſelf, you ſee, never lieth ſtill, but is always in motion; ſo grace in the heart, when ſtirred up by God, it is always working, putting on, drawing out the ſoul: What makes the godly ſo grieved, ſo dejected many times? its the decay, the fall they finde within themſelves, but this cauſing grace makes all things flouriſh.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This cauſing grace, as it preſerveth from decays in the degree of grace, <hi>ſo much more from groſs and foul ſins:</hi> Oh <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> wanted this <note place="margin">2.</note> help in the midſt of their temptations, and therefore they were ſo dangerouſly overcome: This is the onely Preſervative and Antidote againſt ſin; not the principles of grace, but the actings of grace: This is called by the Apoſtle, <hi>Grace to help in time of need,</hi> Heb. 4. 16. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Oh this is admirable, when grace comes in the very need thou wert in! thou wert even falling into ſuch a ſin, thou wert even drowning, and this comes and lifts up thy head.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>This actuating grace will make a man in a prepared frame for every du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and to reſiſt every kinde of temptation;</hi> And what can be more deſired then <note place="margin">3.</note> this? Ask this of God, and you beg the whole Kingdom of grace: He that is prepared to do every duty, and to reſiſt every temptation, though he ſhould drink any deadly thing of ſin, though a Viper of luſt ſhould faſten on him, yet it would not hurt him: Thus the Scripture ſpeaks often of being prepared, and ready for every good work: When God commands Faith, Patience, Zeal, to ſay, My heart is prepared or fixed, <hi>I come to do thy will, O God:</hi> The heart of it ſelf is no ways fitted for any good action; and though the principles of grace be within, yet a man may be very indiſpoſed to what is holy: Now this cauſing grace is the file to take off the ruſt, its the whetting of the edge, its the ſtirring up or blowing of the coals into a flame; and the excellncy of this grace, is no leſs ſeen in the confirming and corroborating of the heart againſt temptations: We are taught to pray conſtantly, <hi>That God would not lead us into temptations.</hi> Temptations have diſcovered the rottenneſs, guile and falſhood of mens hearts: It was a temptation diſcovered the ſecond kinde of ground to have no root; who knoweth his heart in temptations? <hi>Peter</hi> in a temptation, differed much from himſelf when without it. Now there is nothing doth ſo fortifie and
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:30767:302"/>
make the heart in flexible, as this grace, to help in time of need.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>This actuating grace will make a man fruitful and profitable in his</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>place:</hi> This is the trading and merchandizing grace, this makes a man redeem the time, take the preſent ſeaſons of grace, obſerve all opportunities, that he may ſerve God in his generation; ſo that no good thing will be wanting to that man, who hath this daily influence; whereas men lie like lumps of earth, or ſtand like dead and dry trees in the garden of God, if this grace doth not always water them.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>This cauſing, exciting grace, puts a man in a comfortable poſture;</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, <note place="margin">5.</note> that whenſoever our Lord and Maſter ſhall come, he will be pronounced faithful and bleſſed: Thus our Saviour, <hi>Bleſſed is he, whom his maſter when he cometh, ſhall finde ſo doing,</hi> Luke 12. 43. He muſt be doing, he muſt be in his maſters work: This will make a man have oyl enough; Oh therefore that the people of God would hunger and thirſt more after this working, living and quickning grace: How many opportunities doeſt thou neglect? how many priſes are put into thy hand, and thou like a fool doeſt neglect them? how often is thy heart ſluggiſh, dead, and very much indiſpoſed, if Chriſt ſhould come at this or that hour? All is from want of this grace, which puts thy heart in tune, but this would wind up thy ſoul, ſo that thou wouldſt be ready for the work of the Lord.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe of Conviction,</hi> unto the greateſt part in our Congregations, that they are <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> ſuch who never felt the power of this Text upon their ſouls: Where God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news, there he cauſeth men to walk in his ſtatutes, he will overpower their hearts, he will ſubdue their contumacy, he will remove their unwillingneſs: But alas, wo, and again wo for thee! thou findeſt the Devil, that unclean Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ruling in thy heart, he cauſeth thee to walk in all the luſts of ſin, be moves thee to ſerve this corruption, and thou doeſt it; that ſin, and thou doeſt not refuſe it; what is more plain and evident, then that yet this mercy is not vouchſafed to thee? and yet how confident, how ſecure art thou? what, art thou not afraid of Gods word? doeſt thou not believe? doeſt thou think to mock God, and to finde his word falſe? Oh miſerable and wretched men! the more to be pitied, becauſe they pity not themſelves, neither conſider how near they are to eternal wo.</p>

In all good things of this life, thou doeſt judge the uſe and improvement of them all in all; why not then in the principles of grace? Be always ready to ſay, My heart is prepared, O Lord, I can do and ſuffer thy will; eſpecially take heed of all thoſe ſins that may drive or chaſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way this exciting grace; take heed thou doeſt not provoke God to withdraw this aſſiſtance and ſtrength from thee, for that is eaſily done; and know, nothing doth ſooner bereave you of this aſſiſting grace, then neglect of the Ordinances, or the careleſs and ſluggiſh performance of them; for in and by the uſe of theſe, God doth diſcover his power: He bids us wait for this ſtrength, and expect it in theſe.</p>

                     </gap>, our main work, our <hi>Joſeph,</hi> our <hi>Benjamin;</hi> whatſoever is neglected that is not: <note place="margin">What to walk in Gods Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes implyes. 1.</note> Thus our Saviour, <hi>Seek ye firſt the Kingdome of Heaven, and other things ſhall be added,</hi> Matth. 6 33. Grace is the principall; things of this life are but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſory. Hence 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. We muſt buy as if we bought not, we muſt marry as if we married not, and do all earthly things, as if we did them not; that ſo we may ſerve the Lord without diſtraction: Chriſt gave us a good example in doing Gods will, when he did ſo attend on it, that ſometimes he refuſed natural refreſhments, to promote Gods glory, giving this remarkable aſſertion, <hi>Its my meat and drink to do my Fathers will,</hi> John 4. 34. And <hi>David</hi> deſcribeth the godly man by medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:30767:303"/>
in the Law of God day and night. That phraſe doth not imply, we ſhould give over our Callings, and read norhing elſe but the Bible, it onely ſheweth that we make it our chief buſineſſe and imployment to attend to that rule. Therefore, the <hi>Rabbin</hi> took it too litterally, when being asked, whether a man may read Greek Authors, or any humane books but the Bible? He ſwered, If there were any time, that was not part of day, or night; he might an take that time and ſpend it in reading ſuch Books: but this was too ſtrict; it commands us to give the Principality, to give the fat, as it were, to the matters of God. Oh, but who then is converted, if this be ſo? Where is the man that makes Godlineſſe his main work and buſineſſe? VVho riſeth up early, and goeth to bed late to get this bread of life? Look into Perſons, into Families, are not the matters of the world prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before the matters of godlineſſe? Doe not earthly things make you pray, as if you prayed not, ſerve the Lord, as if you ſerved him not? You that are godly think of this truth, and mourn; it is a two-edged ſword: Doth not thy own heart tell thee often, that thou doſt not make godlineſſe thy main buſineſſe; The cares, the ſnares, and the temptations of the world makes thee many times ſeek the things of the earth in the firſt place.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It implyeth voluntarineſſe, delight, and pleaſure in the wayes of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> Its not onely our imploiment, and labour, (for we may be haled to that) but it is our delight, our joy, our greateſt pleaſure we have in this life. To walk is a voluntary action, and frequently uſed for the expreſſion of a mans delight. He is gone to walk, or He walketh in his Garden. Thus God to expreſſe his protection, and delight he hath in us, he promiſeth to walk with us, or amongſt us, &amp; ſet his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle amongſt us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 16. So that thoſe who are converted, finde it more than honey, riches, or all advantages, to be doing the will of their Father. Hence <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110. they are called a willing people, or willingneſſes. <hi>David</hi> doth many times expreſſe that great delight and pleaſure he takes in the Commandments of God: And <hi>Paul, Rom. 7. I delight in the Law of God, in the inward man.</hi> If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Grace and Godlineſſe be thy walk, how great will the joy and gladneſſe of thy heart be in all approaches near to him? Everie dutie will be like the Mount of Transfiguration, of which thou wilt ſay, <hi>Its good to be here.</hi> As our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſaid, <hi>He that drinks of the old Wine, would not care for the new.</hi> And thus the godly man that hath taſted of the goodneſſe of God, and the ſweetneſſe of grace, will forget his earthly pleaſures. This <hi>Manna</hi> will make a man deſpiſe Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Garlick: This fatted Calf will make a man regard no more any Husks: So that you who look upon all godly duties conſtantly as a weariſomneſſe, a burden, how can you ſay God hath wrought this new heart in you? Indeed the dulneſſe, ſluggiſhneſſe, and partial weariſomneſſe that ſurprizeth even the godly many times, doth argue Converſion is but in part, and imperfect: and therefore they ſhould be in an holy manner grieved, and ſhamed in ſoul to hear and think of theſe things, ſaying. Theſe holy truths have too much luſter and dazeling in them, more then my weak infirm eyes are able to behold. Oh then hunger and thirſt more after this ſweetneſſe and pleaſure, which is to be had in holineſſe. This will be On to the wheels; yea like the ſpirit in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> wheels to make the ſoul move ſwiftly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>To walk denoteth diligence, frequency and Cuſtomarineſs.</hi> There is a great <note place="margin">3.</note> difference between ſetting a mans foot accidentally or occaſionally in a path, and walking in it: <hi>Ahab</hi> occaſionally humbled himſelf, but it was not his way. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> deſired <hi>to dye the death of the righteous;</hi> but did he ever doe ſo before? <hi>He did not walk in the way of righteouſneſſe.</hi> To walk is a conſtant, frequent, cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary exerciſe of a man, and doth not ſignifie what a man in ſome fits, or ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions may doe, but what he is accuſtomed to: Even as the godly man, he ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times turns aſide out of the path of righteouſneſſe into wayes of wickedneſſe: <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> did ſo: yet we doe not ſay, they did walk in wickedneſſe; wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was not their conſtant cuſtomary practice: ſo it is with the wicked man, they
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:30767:304"/>
ſometimes, eſpecially under calamities and fears, ſtep into the wayes of Godlineſs, they doe ſome godly and righteous things: but this is not their way, its not their cuſtome: So that its not the bare doing holy and righteous actions: but are theſe thy way? doſt thou walk in theſe? Is it not by meer accident, ſome ſuddain occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; as a contrary wind ſometimes driveth in the paſſenger to another Port then he expected or deſired.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>To walk, implyeth progreſſe and increaſe in godlineſſe.</hi> To walk is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive motion, and every ſtep a man takes he gaineth more ground, and is nearer <note place="margin">4.</note> to his journeys end; and thus it is in godlineſſe. The Converted man he gaineth, he groweth, he is nearer the top of the hill than he was. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> you may ſee him not onely walking, but even running <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, I preſſe hard after, I forget the things that are behinde. Oh this is a neceſſarie point: for who attends to growth in Grace? To get more of this treaſure, though the Scripture doth ſo often preſſe it. The old rule is, <hi>Non progredi, eſt regredi;</hi> Not to go forward, is to go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Yet how many are at a ſtand, yea decay and abate in former graces! Is this to walk in the wayes of God? like <hi>Hezekiah's</hi> Sun, thou art gone ſo many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees backward. Into what a Conſumption art thou fallen? who would take thee to be the ſame thou wert once? Every duty and grace is ſo withered, that as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaid of his body, <hi>Thy bones ſtand out through leanneſſe.</hi> It may be indeed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a Converted mans condition, not to walk on forward, but to fall backward, and be many degrees ſhort of what others are, who ſet out at the ſame time with him, but then they recover again to their great advantage. As Children after a diſeaſe hath pulled them down, when they recover, they ſhoot out higher. As ſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling makes a man get more ground, ſo that even in their verie ſins, though they be <hi>extra ſemitam,</hi> yet not <hi>extra viam;</hi> for the grace of God recovering them will make this very letting a whetting to them, and be more zealous and active, by how much they have been negligent. Howſoever therefore there may be accidental ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and checks to grace in its walk: yet the Nature and inclination of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is to be always carrying us on to further perfection. This walking is ſtill nearer and nearer to our journeys end: Faith is increaſed, Love and heavenly-mindedneſs are more promoted. Remember therefore, thou art a Traveller, thy godlineſſe is a walking; ſit not down, and ſay, <hi>Soul take thy eaſe,</hi> for thou haſt grace enough, godlineſſe enough: This is an Argument thou haſt none at all. When <hi>Laodicea</hi> ſaid, <hi>She was full, and rich, and wanted nothing,</hi> then ſhe was poor and miſerable, and wanted all things, <hi>Rev. 3. Apelles</hi> when he had drawn his line, would write <hi>faciebat,</hi> in the imperfect Tenſe, and not <hi>fecit;</hi> to ſhew that ſtill he did intend to perfect, to complete it; ſtill ſomething is wanting; and this may be written upon all our graces, <hi>Credebat,</hi> not <hi>credidit, amabat,</hi> not <hi>amavit,</hi> There is ſome imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yea many defects which are conſtantly to be amended. I earneſtly deſire this truth might be faſtned upon the godly. They are not in growing poſtures: they come not and ſay, <hi>Lord this Talent of five hath gained ten;</hi> they ſay not, This mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard-ſeed is grown up into a great tree; they ſpeak as a child in grace, and not as perfect men.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, <hi>As to walk implyeth Progreſſe, ſo it ſuppoſeth that in this life we can never attain to a period, to a full reſt;</hi> all is walking here in this life, in heaven there is reſt, <note place="margin">5.</note> then we are ſet in our Thrones after victorie and conqueſt over our luſts, and the world. As God in the old Teſtament firſt had his Tabernacle, which was not fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but ambulatorie, removed from place to place; and afterwards his Temple, a place of reſt, where his people were to ſit down and enjoy God: ſo it is with his Children in the New Teſtament, they are in a Tabernacle here, their Temple is in heaven: This ſhould comfort the people of God, as the former might provoke and inflame them; they have not ſuch maſterie over their hearts as they deſire, they are in continuall combate and conflict, they are exceeding ſhort of thoſe excellent graces propounded to them; let not this diſmay them, they doe but walk as yet in the way of godlineſſe, they are not come to their journeys end, they are
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:30767:304" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not yet to ſit down. The godly would havean have an here upon earth, whereas God hath made this life, and that to come in two diſtinct diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, <hi>This walking in the way of Godlineſſe doth ſuppoſe a guide, a light to direct</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>and inform them, that they may not ſtumble and fall.</hi> There are Land marks and Sea-marks for Paſſengers; and ſo the Word of God that is the guide, that is the light to walk by. <hi>As many as walk according to this rule,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle. There are many walk in a diſorderly, looſe, and lawleſſe manner. They have no Law but their luſts, no guide but their blind paſſions, and affections: but the walking of the godly is in an exact, orderly and godly manner. Now onely the Word of God can direct and guide herein. Hence <hi>David</hi> doth ſo often commend it for a <hi>Lant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horn to his feet, and a Lamp to his paths.</hi> No man can tell how to live, or how to believe, or how to worſhip God, without his Word: We cannot tell how to pray, how to hear, how to live godly, and righteouſly without this rule: ſo that thouſands of people diſcover they have none of this mercy in the Text vouchſafed to them; for, do they not live like bruit beaſts? Are not their luſts, their fancies the rule they live by? Give me the man that lives by the Scripture, that walks by the Scripture, that thinketh, that ſpeaketh, that doeth by Scripture directions. There could not be ſuch walking in darkneſſe, and ſtumbling therein, if men did attend to this light. Oh that this truth might enter into you; My life is a walk, and I muſt have ſome Rule to guide me; and what is that but Gods Word? How then can I lye, curſe, blaſpheme by that information? Where doth the word allow, or command me ſuch things? Be no longer like the Horſe and Mule that have no underſtanding, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member you are men, and ſo muſt have a rule of reaſon and piety to live by, and that is Gods Word. Men are convinced that they muſt have no other faith or Religion then what the word commands: but they doe not conſider this is as true alſo for their lives: They muſt live no other lives, do no other actions, then this word requireth.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>As Gods Word is the rule they walk by, ſo God himſelf is the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">7.</note> 
                     <hi>that they ought to walk with.</hi> You are not alone in this walk, but God is with you. The Scripture hath a three-fold phraſe: There is walking with God, walking before God, and walking, or following after God, and they all have their peculiar Emphaſis. To walk with God; Thus <hi>Enoch</hi> is ſaid to doe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 22, and that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth an heavenly, holy, and humble, yet familiar enjoyment of God in our way. <hi>Can two walk together except they be agreed?</hi> And therefore no wicked man can walk in theſe paths of godlineſſe, becauſe not agreed with God: God is an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie and an enemy to them: but the godly in this their journey to heaven have ſweet communion with, and enjoyment of God: As God ſpake to <hi>Moſes</hi> as one friend to another, by way of apparition; ſo doth God in a ſpirituall way to the godly; God is graciouſly preſent with him, he ſupports him, comforts him: And if he ſaid, <hi>Come<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then there is to walk before God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 1. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> is commanded, and that is ſo to walk in the wayes of Godlineſſe, as to eye God, to have a reſpect to pleaſe him, to take heed of the moſt ſecret ſinnes, knowing God hath an omniſcient eye, and therefore that is the ground of ſincerity, which the Scripture cals Perfection; <hi>Walk before me and be perfect.</hi> Laſtly, the Scripture hath the expreſſion of walking after God, in oppoſition to that phraſe, of walking after their Idols, or other gods, <hi>or the imagination of their own hearts,</hi> Jer. 18. 12. And that is, when men follow the directions and guidance God vouchſafeth, eſpecially in matter of worſhip: God goeth before us, as it were, with the light of his Word in his hand, and we are to follow after. This truth hath been too ſpirituall, even for all the ages of the Church almoſt, who have not followed God in their worſhip; but the Cuſtomes and ſuperſtitious Inventions of men. Now among other qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in walking that the Scripture may ſpeak of, there are four obſervable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="558" facs="tcp:30767:305"/>
Firſt, <hi>To walk uprightly.</hi> He that walketh uprightly, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10. 9. walketh bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Contrary to this is halting in the way of Godlineſſe. The Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 13. <note place="margin">1.</note> exhorts them to make ſtraight paths for their feet, <hi>leſt that which is lame be turned out of ike way.</hi> Its not enough to be in the way of Godlineſſe; All Hypocrites are ſo: but we muſt take heed we halt not between God and <hi>Baal,</hi> as the Scripture ſpeaks. <hi>Judas</hi> was in Chriſts way, but he halted between Chriſt and the affections of the world. As the Heifers taken from their young ones, they went ſtraight on with the Ark, but they bellowed and moaned for their young ones: ſo it may be thou art driven on in the external wayes of holineſſe, but thou moaneſt, and thy heart runs after ſin, or the world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>To walk by faith,</hi> and not by ſenſe; ſo the Apoſtle, <hi>We walk by faith, 2 Cor.</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>. 7. And this is ſuch a walking that the world doth not underſtand, <note place="margin">2.</note> To walk by faith is to be above all principles of ſenſe, carnall reaſonings, wordly fears, or delights, eying the Promiſe, beholding Gods favour in Chriſt. This is a comfortable, peaceable, and ſecure walking.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>To walk, requireth that our feet be ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d with the preparation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,</hi> Epheſ. 6. 15. That was part of their Armour in former times, to have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence <note place="margin">3.</note> or munition for their feet; &amp; this the Apoſtle makes the preparation made by the Goſpel of peace. We have many doubts, fears, and other diſcouragements in the way to heaven; Not ſluggiſhneſſe, but truth it ſelf may ſay, There is a Lion, yea, many Lions, and ſuch as go roaring to devour in the way: and the guilt of Sin may make every man a <hi>Cain</hi> to go up and down trembling. Now the Goſpel makes a ſure and good preparation againſt this.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Its required that we ſhould walk circumspectly.</hi> So the Apoſtle, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Not as fools, but as wiſe,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 15. And were this the main intent of the Text, it <note place="margin">4.</note> would have been profitable to ſhew the grounds of this circumſpect walking; we may hint them to you. The way you walk in is a ſtrait narrow way, its eaſie ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping out of it into the pit. Godlineſſe is bounded with limits, but ſin is a broad way. Now how difficult is it, ſo to order our ſteps as to ſtep aright continually? <hi>Tertullian</hi> cals Chriſtians, <hi>Funambuli,</hi> Rope-walkers, Thoſe that ſtep in the leaſt manner awry are in danger of killing themſelves. How apt are we to take that for faith, patience, and zeal, which is not ſo. Secondly, walk circumſpectly, becauſe we have a great journey to go, and a little time; our walk is a very long one, and night is ſuddenly coming on us; if he ſaid, <hi>Ars longa, vita brevis,</hi> we may ſay, <hi>Pietas eſt longa, lata &amp; prefunda.</hi> Thirdly, there are many enemies, thieves, and Robbers in the way, ſpiritual and inviſible adverſaries in heavenly places; and theſe watch to intercept thee in the journey: They do not lye in wait, as thoſe ſpies to kil <hi>Paul,</hi> but damn the ſoul. Thy Grace is a precious treaſure, and they ſtrive to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Uſe of <hi>Examination,</hi> Try thy ſelf by this Touchſtone, what is thy walk, thy way, thy imployment. Is it not to make proviſion for the luſts of the fleſh: The <note place="margin">Uſe. 1.</note> Scripture ſaith, Some mens hearts walk after their own imaginations, others after covetouſneſſe; ſome mens tongues are ſaid to walk through the earth. Oh do not think, if thou walk in ſuch wayes, that heaven will be the journeys end. Neither maiſt thou take Sanctuary under thy Duties, thy Devotions on ſome ſolemn occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; for theſe are not thy walk, thy way; and ſo they will not be owned for the paths of godlineſſe: we that walk and paſſe away as ſhadowes, how ſhould we lay up for an enduring treaſure?</p>
                  <p>Uſe of <hi>Exhortation</hi> to the godly: Make Godlineſſe your chief imployment, your buſineſſe, and your great delight. Oh take heed of every thing that ſhall ſteal <note place="margin">Uſe 2.</note> away thy heart. Though grace indeed be ſuch a Treaſure, that Thieves and, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers cannot by violence ſteal it away, yet there are ſpirituall thieves, that are ſweet and ſugred enemies, either temptations within or without; and theſe may deprive thee of thy choice Jewels, if thou watch not. Oh ſay, I am not my ſelf, I am not as I would be, all the while I am hindred or oppoſed in

the work of godlineſs. Is thy heart at any time overcharged, and even drunk with the comforts of this life? Reprove and chide thy ſelf. Count every day and hour loſt that doth not make for Heaven one way or other.</p>

                     <hi>Statutes</hi> are all thoſe Rites, and that manner of worſhip which God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; <note place="margin">Statutes.</note> and howbeit we may in this Text make <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Judgements.</hi> all one, yet its better to diſtinguiſh them, becauſe the holy Ghoſt doth here ſeem as it were to branch out the whole practice and life of a converted perſon, which lieth in two things, His Duty to God, and that is, <hi>To walk in Gods Statutes;</hi> His Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to man, and that is, <hi>To walk in his Judgements to do them.</hi> And although in the New Teſtament, we have not the ſame Statutes of worſhip as they had, nor the ſame judicial Law for juſtice and equity between man and man, yet the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is, that God will cauſe his people to walk in all that worſhip and equity which God at any time ſhall command: And it is very uſual in the Old Teſtament to expreſſe the Worſhip of God, which ſhall be uſed in the times of the Goſpel, under theſe names, which were proper to the legal Adminiſtration. This then is the ſenſe, That when God hath put this new heart and new ſpirit into his children, he will make them diligent in all that worſhip which he hath commanded, they will be careful to worſhip him in that pure and holy manner, which is appointed: All their Worſhip will be Statute-worſhip, there is the Statute-Law of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture for it.

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That Divines make a two-fold Worſhip, Internal and External, Internal are all thoſe spiritual graces of the ſoul, which are immediatly terminated upon God himſelf.</hi> Thus faith in God, and love of God, to give him the preheminency and chief room in the heart, is the worſhip of God: This is ſpiritual and inward, and this Worſhip is commanded in the firſt Commandment. But the external Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God conſiſts in all thoſe viſible parts and means of worſhip which God hath appointed, as in the Old Teſtament praying, reading the Word, offering of Sacrifices, and many bodily adorations; and theſe are commanded in the ſecond Commandment: for when God forbids the worſhipping of him by Images, he doth thereby forbid the making to a mans ſelf, without the Commandment of God, any part or means of Divine Worſhip. In the New Teſtament Gods ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Worſhip lieth in prayer, reading and hearing the Word, adminiſtration of the Sacraments, ſanctifying of his Sabbaths, and ſinging of Pſalms; ſo then he who is truly godly, he will be carefull to perform all thoſe Duties of Religious Worſhip, which are commanded in the New Teſtament. He doth not take up the vain cuſtoms of men, neither doth he follow the traditional worſhip of his Fathers, but he worſhippeth as it is written, he knoweth God is moſt jealous of his Worſhip; God is very ſenſible of any abuſe of his Worſhip, any corruption or mixture of it by humane preſumption.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Although God hath commanded this Statute-worſhip, yet that golden Rule of our Saviours muſt alwayes be remembred,</hi> John 4. where Chriſt taking off <note place="margin">2.</note> the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> from her old traditional worſhip, thinking that ſuch a Mountain was better to worſhip God on, then other places, <hi>God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is a Spirit, and will be worſhipped in spirit and truth, and my Father ſeeketh ſuch:</hi> By this we are admirably inſtructed, that <hi>all external worſhip of God must yet be ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual:</hi> It is not the bowing of the body, nor the external humiliation that God looks after, <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> and ſo doth chiefly require Spirit-worſhip: This Text would have been like the flaming fiery ſword to have kept off that intollerable bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of falſe worſhip which afterwards crept into the Paradiſe of God. It is a ſin that we are very prone unto, to reſt upon an external worſhip, not lifting up our hearts unto God, and that made the Apoſtle ſpeak ſo contemptibly even of the ceremonial Worſhip, and all thoſe Jewiſh Ordinances though appointed by God, calling them carnal and beggarly elements. The ſuperſtitious Jewes made them Elements, even the firſt principles and foundation of Religion, but he cals them beggarly, becauſe they were without Chriſt; ſo that all thy outward ſervice and worſhip of God is but an empty, beggarly Religion, unleſſe it be ſpiritually per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and that is mainly by reſting on Chriſt in thoſe Ordinances. But I do not intend an exact treating upon the religious and divine Worſhip of God; I ſhall therefore in the next place inſtance in two or three of the New Teſtament Statutes which God hath commanded to be religiouſly obſerved, and then ſhew the grounds of this pious and religious diſpoſition in converted perſons.</p>
                  <p>And firſt one of Chriſts main Statute-worſhips is <hi>Prayer.</hi> Not in the <hi>Socinian</hi> ſenſe who make Pryera new inſtituted worſhip by God, and that it was not a <note place="margin">Prayer.</note>
                     <pb n="561" facs="tcp:30767:306"/>
Duty commanded before; Not ſo, only Chriſt continueth and confirmeth this Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, revealing the manner of it more clearly. Thus you have many Precepts and Examples for prayer, yea and this is to be done fervently, humbly, inceſſantly; and it is recorded as a ſign of <hi>Pauls</hi> Converſion, <hi>Behold he prayeth,</hi> Act 9. 11. and <hi>Zach.</hi> 12. The Spirit of Prayer and Supplication, with mourning and hearty grief is promiſed under the Goſpel: Inſomuch that you cannot have a ſurer ſigne of a graceleſs man then one who is not diligent in this Duty and worſhip of God, Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. For although our own manifold neceſſities of all ſorts might provoke us to this Duty, God hath alſo ſo diligently enjoyned it, that there might be an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to open the fountain of his mercy to us. Oh then how few are there that partake of this benefit? Where is he of whom we may ſay, <hi>Behold he prayeth,</hi> conſtantly, fervently, effectually? nay in ſtead of Prayer there is curſing, ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and blaſpheming; if they do pray, they have ſome ſhort prayers of rote, which they utter as Parrats underſtanding nothing of it, and ſo irreligiouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging of it: Now Prayer is three-fold, Private, perſonal Prayer, of which <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks much, and Chriſt went many times apart to prayer. Tell me then, Doſt thou take Chriſts command, <hi>Enter into thy cloſet, and ſhut thy door after thee, Matth.</hi> 5. Doth God ſee thy ſecret groans, thy ſecret tears, thy private debaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? if grace be in thee, thou wilt be diligent in this courſe. Then there is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick prayer, of which the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> ſpeaks, and Chriſt alledgeth it, <hi>That his houſe ſhall be called an houſe of Prayer;</hi> and our Saviour ſpeaks of two or three, any company gathered together, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 20. to ask any thing of the Father in Chriſts Name. Now this publick Prayer is alſo much obſerved by the new heart, for therein is an united ſtrength and force to lay hold upon God, and God is in the midſt of his people ſo gathered together, to open his hand plentifully to beſtow on them his mercies.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, There is Family-prayer, ſo <hi>Joſhua, I and my houſe will ſerve the Lord, Joſh.</hi> 24. 15. And God takes ſpecial notice of <hi>Abraham,</hi> He knew <hi>Abraham</hi> would make his Family to ſerve the Lord, <hi>Gen. 18. 19. Jeremiah</hi> prayeth, <hi>That God would pour his wrath upon thoſe families that call not on his name,</hi> Jer. 10. 25. You may reade of the Churches in ſome Chriſtians houſes, becauſe of the ſpiritual worſhip of God therein. If then God had ever wrought this new heart in thee, how dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent wouldſt thou be to walk in all the ſtatutes of Prayer, Private, Publick, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily-prayer; Thou dareſt not for a world ſo ſinfully neglect this worſhip of God, as thou doeſt; Think not that any civil and honeſt converſation in the world is enough without this worſhip. Oh but what unclean dens, yea noiſome hels are ſome mens families! Is prayer there? Is there conſtant religious calling upon God? No, in ſtead of theſe, diſſoluteneſſe and prophaneneſſe; Oh the pillars of the houſe, and the wals thereof will one day witneſſe againſt ſuch.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Statute for religious duties, I ſhall only inſtance in, is of <hi>The Lords</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The Lords-day</note> 
                     <hi>day,</hi> and the ſtrict holy Obſervation of that: Where godlineſſe is, there they will call the <hi>Sabbaths a delight,</hi> Iſa. 58. 13. and not ſpeak their own words, or think their own thoughts; that is a promiſe to be fulfilled in the times of the Goſpel. That the obſervation of a ſeventh day is not Jewiſh, is plain, becauſe it was inſtituted for <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency; ſo that although <hi>Adam</hi> was made ſo pure and holy, that in all his works of his calling, <hi>viz. To till the garden,</hi> &amp;c. he could not but have an heavenly heart, yet God would have him to have one day, which God bleſſed and ſanctified, for the wholly applying of himſelf to the immediate worſhip of God; and for the continuation of a ſeventh day, though the Jewiſh day be alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you have upon Chriſts Reſurrection plain examples of the altering of it to the firſt day of the week, ſo that we reade of their Church-aſſemblies on that day; and <hi>John</hi> cals it, <hi>The Lords day,</hi> Rev. 1. All which conjoyned make it appear, That there is a moral and perpetual obligation lying upon us to the diligent obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it. So then, Where God puts his new Spirit, there he makes a willingneſſe, a tender conſcience and delight to ſanctifie it; Oh then take heed of thoſe licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="562" facs="tcp:30767:307"/>
Doctrines that cry down the Lords-day, for by the holy ſanctiſying of it, thou wilt come to delight in the Lord more, thy graces will increaſe and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; As ſome from corrupt principles neglect it, ſo others from vicious and prophane affections, or from worldly covetous deſires. Thus they in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet asked, <hi>When will the Sabbaths be over, that they might buy and ſell and get gain?</hi> Amos 8. 5. Thy tender conſcience therefore about the holy ſanctiſying of the Sabbath, will much demonſtrate the ſavoury work of grace upon thee. This may ſuffice for two examples of the Statute-worſhip of God in the New Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>Now let us ſee, why the godly are ſo careful and tender about Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. <note place="margin">Why the godly are ſo tender about Gods worſhip. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And firſt it is, <hi>Becauſe God himſelf is ſo tender about it.</hi> There is no ſin about which Gods jealouſie is ſo much ſaid to he provoked, as in matter of falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: Reade the Prophets, you ſhall ſee the great controverſie God had with his people, was for the corrupting of his worſhip; This in every Chapter is almoſt complained of; therefore the common word the Scripture uſeth for Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry and falſe worſhip is Abomination: And Chriſt uſing that expreſſion, What is highly eſteemed amongſt men is abomination unto God, ſpeaketh it chiefly to that phariſaical inſtituted worſhip, wherein they did place all their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; now this, that was ſo highly advanced as the onely religion and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of God, was abomination unto him: Seeing therefore that Gods worſhip is the apple of his eye; the main thing he is ſo jealous about, and his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been ſo terrible upon men, who have in any manner violated his order about religious things; as his puniſhing <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> for offering with ſtrange fire, and ſtriking <hi>Uzzah</hi> dead for not keeping meerly to order, makes a godly man very carefull about the worſhip of God, to ſee he giveth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that and all that which God requireth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>He therefore is diligent in this, becauſe the word of God is the onely Rule of worſhip, and ſo every one muſt be able to give a reaſon from Scripture, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>of ſuch and ſuch religious Duties.</hi> Thoſe that have a new heart are made <hi>light in the Lord;</hi> They take the Scripture for the way to walk in; and whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not Scripture-worſhip, what Religion is not Scripture-religion, they dare not own it. Tell a godly man of the Antiquity of ſuch worſhip, of the univerſality of it, of the excellent fitneſſe it hath to keep humble and devout, all theſe are but fig-leaves. Is it commanded worſhip? Is there the Statute Law of the Scripture for it? Alas, let thy Fathers and Grand-fathers, yea let all the world admire ſuch and ſuch worſhip; if it be not Gods command, it is a vain thing: How clear is our Saviour, <hi>In vain do they worſhip me, teaching for Doctrines the traditions of men.</hi> Our Saviour told the woman of <hi>Samaria, She worſhipped ſhe knew not what, becauſe ſhe had not the Scripture,</hi> Joh. 4. Oh then, how might this put to ſilence all the cavils and fooliſh pleas many people have, for ſuperſtitious falſe wayes of worſhip, bring thy Scripture for it, ſhew Gods word for it: Thy doting and raging for theſe things, where Gods word is no light to thee, is as great an argument of a carnal heart devoid of grace, as well as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe, and they for the moſt part goe together; Thoſe that are for ſuch ſuperſtitious worſhip are commonly prophane, and ungodly in their lives.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Therefore the people of God are carefull of worſhip, and that only which God hath commanded, becauſe they are a ſpiritual heavenly people, endowed with know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>and wiſdom out of Gods word, and ſo able to diſcern of things that differ.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Col.</hi> 4. uſeth this argument againſt obſervation of ſuperſtitious worſhip, which he had ſpoken againſt in the Chapter before, <hi>If ye be riſen again with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things that are above, and ſet your affections on things above;</hi> which <hi>Calvin</hi> doth ſolidly underſtand, not only of luſts and earthly things, but alſo of thoſe humane Ordinances and will-worſhip he had immediately ſpoken
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:30767:307"/>
of before; ſo that he is of a brutiſ, blinde minde, an unclean beaſt that never cheweth the cud, who doth not conſider and well adviſe about the worſhip of God, but takes every thing out of cuſtom, and what is obtruded upon him; but a godly man is of a more noble rational ſpirit, he will ſearch the Scripture whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch things are to be done or no.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Therefore the godly are diligent in the pure worſhip of God, becauſe God</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>draweth nigh in thoſe religious Duties;</hi> where every thing is done according to his will, there he delights to be preſent; How many glorious bleſſings did God promiſe to his pure worſhip in the Temple, till they defiled it by abominations; and then he deſtroyed both the Nation and the Temple. Where therefore the pure worſhip and ordinances of God are, there he walketh, there he poureth out his love. The Church is then in no ſtrange habit, but the beautiful orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments God hath decked her with; and when Gods worſhip is thus purely perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, he addeth to their graces; <hi>None ſeek Gods face in vain,</hi> his promiſé and inſtitution go along together; let a man a thouſand times over uſe ſuch Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and worſhip God hath not commanded, he will never be the more holy. There cannot be any ſpirituall effect communicated unto him, becauſe God will onely work where he hath promiſed, and his promiſe is only to his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions.</p>
                  <p>Fiſthly, <hi>They are careful to obſerve his Statute-worſhip, becauſe it is a Duty to God;</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> He is their Lord and God, their Soveraign from whom they have all, and outward worſhip is a paying of homage to him, as an humble and ſubmiſſive acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of God; <hi>Come</hi> (ſaith the Pſalmiſt) <hi>let us fall down and worſhip before him, becauſe he hath made us and not we our ſelves;</hi> All ſolemn religious Duties, they are not onely inſtituted means of grace, but ſolemn teſtifications and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements of our humility, ſubmiſſion, dependance upon God, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation of his great excellency; ſo that if the godly man ſhould be negligent here, he ſhould not give unto God that which is Gods: And hereby is greatly diſcovered the falſhood and arrogancy of thoſe ſpirits who think they are above Ordinances; for ſuppoſe (which is not in this life) that thou wert already ſo holy and perfect, that thou wert above any benefits by the Ordinances, that thou didſt not need the benefit of the Word preached, and the Sacraments; yet thou canſt not be above them, as they are teſtifications of thy duty towards God. Hence the Angels in Heaven they worſhip and ſerve God according to their <note place="margin">Men that ſay they are above Ordinances.</note> way; and wilt thou (O vain man!) ſet up thy ſelf on ſo high a pinacle, as not to worſhip God? Remember Ordinances are not only means of grace, but ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn teſtifications of our humility and dependancy on God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe of Examination,</hi> Try the work of grace in you by this particular, how <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> tender and carefull are you about the worſhip of God? Are you ſuch who pray for the purity of Ordinances, to have every thing in Church-aſſemblies done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the patern in the Scripture? <hi>David</hi> cried out, <hi>How amiable are thy Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles, O Lord of hoſts?</hi> In what zeal was Chriſt, when he ſaw the Temple of God <hi>turned into a den of thieves?</hi> What holy invectives doth <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtles make againſt ſuperſtitious worſhip? yet how few are the men that minde the pure inſtituted worſhip of God, that would have the fountains of <hi>Iſrael</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the mixture of any mud in them? Outward oppreſſions in Popery were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo heavy upon the godly, as the corrupt mixtures in Gods worſhip; but if you obſerve the general diſpoſition of men, they are wholly carried out to ſome ſenſible ſuperſtitious wayes of worſhip. They love not the ſimplicity and purity of Gods worſhip. It is great proficiency in Chriſtianity not to have our minds corrupted herein. As children delight in babies, ſo do men in ſome wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of their own that they have made. What is Popery but a meer ſtage-play in the worſhip of God? And if you ask of hundreds of Ceremonies they have, <hi>Whoſe Image and Superſcription is upon them?</hi> you ſhall finde none of Gods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed on them. There were the Statutes of the Heathens, <hi>Levit.</hi> 20. and theſe

the people muſt not go in, <hi>Ezek. 20. There are ſtatutes of our fathers we muſt not walk in:</hi> Oh there is too much of this ſuperſtition ſtill in men! Men by falſe worſhip, manifeſt they have not ſpiritual hearts.</p>

                     <p>Of Righteouſneſs and Equity between man and man: And how tender and conſcientious a true Convert is therein.</p>
                  </argument>

                     <bibl>EZEK. 36. 27.</bibl>
                     <q>And ye ſhall keep my judgements, and do them.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>I Am now upon the latter general Branch, into which the whole work of Converſion divideth it ſelf. <hi>Religion to God,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs to man,</hi> are the two pillars upon which this ſpiritual Temple is ſuſtained: God hath put theſe two together, yet how often doth the Devil and mans corruption di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them! ſome attend wholly to the Religious Worſhip of God, but are groſly neglective of righteous and juſt things; others glory much in their righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to man, but ſhew no piety at all in their lives to God. Now where God giveth this new heart, there is a tender conſcience of both: And the firſt hath been diſpatched, under the notion of <hi>Statutes,</hi> which ſtrictly taken, relateth to the purity of Gods inſtituted Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>We come to the ſecond particular; <hi>viz. Righteouſneſs and Equity to man,</hi> contained in theſe words, <hi>Keep my judgements, and do them:</hi> It cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but that the word <hi>Judgement</hi> in the Scripture, is of a vaſt and large ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, which I ſhall not enumerate at this time: Here I take it ſtrictly and diſtinctly, as in other places, for obedience to thoſe Laws of God, which contain righteouſneſs and equity between man &amp; man; in which ſenſe the Prophets often call upon the Iſraelites, <hi>To do judgement, and juſtice, and to break off the ways of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, oppreſſion, wrong, and all unrighteouſneſs.</hi> So that we may obſerve:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A Converted perſon is very conſcientious and tender in all the duties of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and equity to others.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>He dareth not pray, hear, make a ſtrict profeſſion of Religion to God; and yet lye, cozen, deal falſely, wrong or defraud any man in his dealings; <hi>He hath a reſpect to all Gods Commandments,</hi> Pſal. 119. he knoweth the ſame God who commanded the Precepts of the firſt Table, containing duty to, and worſhip of God; doth alſo equally and indiſpenſably require duties of faithfulneſs and righteouſneſs to men. This point is of ſingular uſe, for wherein doth Religion get greater wounds, the Goſpel more diſhonor, then when men in repute for godlineſs, are found guilty and blame-worthy in the ways of diſhoneſty? To have wicked men lye, ſwear and forſwear, to defraud and injure others, the world expects no better, looks for no other; but for thee, a profeſſor of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it expects all truth, fidelity, righteouſneſs, elſe thou art a dead flie in the box of ointment, a ſcandal and reproach to the ways of God; and thou hadſt better never to have been born, then to prove ſuch a ſtumbling block in the ways of piety. Indeed, there are paſſive ſcandals, when men will malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and falſly raiſe ſlanders and falſe reports of the profeſſors of Religion,
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:30767:308"/>
laying to their charge things they never did, believing lyes, and miſinterpreting their words and actions; and theſe will be, as long as wicked men are in the world: And hence it is, that all godly men are looked upon as Hypocrites, as ſuch as will lye and do falſly, yea, do any thing for their advantages: But theſe are paſſive ſcandals, and theſe offences come from the venimous diſpoſition of wicked men; and the godly may rejoce in their innocency, while ſuch crimes are laid upon them. But then there are active ſcandals, when men of ſtrict pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, do indeed walk in ſuch unjuſt and unrighteous ways, that thereby the name of God is blaſphemed among wicked men: Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Wo be to that man, by whom ſuch offences come,</hi> Matth. 16. 7. So that we deſire this truth ſhould ſound aloud in the ears of all thoſe, who take themſelves for Converts; their faith and piety muſt be accompanied with all righteouſneſs and honeſty. Hence whereas converted perſons have ſeveral Titles and Attributes, denoting ſeveral qualities in them; there is nothing more frequent and ordinary, then to call them <hi>Righteous,</hi> this is in every page; How then is a Lyer righteous in his words? how is a breaker of his word and promiſe, righteous in his fidelity? how is a cheater or an overreaching man righteous in his dealings?</p>
                  <p>To open this, conſider, <hi>That there is a twofold original fountain of Righteouſneſs</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The fountain and riſe of all righteouſneſs between man and man. Humane laws.</note> 
                     <hi>towards man:</hi> 1. There is the immediate command and word of God, and that is called <hi>Jus Divinum,</hi> Divine Righteouſneſs. 2. There is the Law and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Nature, and that is <hi>Jus Humanum,</hi> An humane Righteouſneſs, or Right: And this is either general, the firſt and immediate principles of nature, ſuch as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. concerning the Gentiles, <hi>That they had a Law written in their hearts, verſe</hi> 7. about juſt and unjuſt things, and their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences accuſing or excuſing, upon the omiſſion or commiſſion of ſuch things, or elſe they are more remote and particular dictates, ſuch as the good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes Laws of all Law-givers, in reſpective Nations: So what is righteous and juſt between man and man, is to be determined by the Laws of that Land where they live: Indeed, if any Law-givers (as ſome Heatheniſh have) commanded or allowed any thing that is againſt the Law of God, or the univerſal dictates of right reaſon; ſuch commands are not worthy the name of Laws, they are rather unjuſt decrees, and ſo do not binde: But otherwiſe, the Laws of a Land determine what is righteous and juſt between man and man: for although it be Gods command, <hi>That a man ſhould not ſteal,</hi> yet they are humane Laws that give the bounds and proprieties of eſtates to men: So that we Chriſtians, and the Jews, do ſomething differ about the Rules of Righteouſnes and Equity; for God was the immediate Law-giver unto that people: <hi>Moſes</hi> as a meſſenger from God, received from Gods mouth the Judicial Law, which he delivered to them; ſo that the Judicial Law appointed by God himſelf, was the Statute-Law of that Realm: Their Laws were not Humane, as all the Laws of Kingdoms and States are ſince Chriſts coming, but they were Divine: Their Laws about a Theif, a Murtherer, the Buyer and the Seller, were all Divine Laws, becauſe immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commanded by God, though the matter was meerly humane: Now its great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſputed, how far theſe Judicial Laws, commanding Judgement and Juſtice between man and man, do binde us Chriſtians; and whether all Law-givers and States-men, are not bound to bring in thoſe Judicial Laws? for who can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what is Righteouſneſs and Equity better then God, a righteous and wiſe God? Its not pertinent to wade into this excellent Queſtion at this time: Though ſome in this point are very rigid, to make all Obligatory, that are not expreſsly repealed by Chriſt; and ſome again are very remiſs and lax; yet all conclude, That the Moral Equity and Reaſon that was in every Judicial Law, doth binde Chriſtians as well as Jews; and with that we ſhall conclude this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, whatſoever Law God made about Juſtice, Reſtitution or Puniſhment to the Jews, the Equity and reaſon of that Law, doth ſtill binde us, though not the particular maner. As for the New Teſtament, Chriſts Kingdoms was not
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:30767:309"/>
temporal, or of this world; and therefore he onely commands Righteouſneſs in the general, and commands that excellent Maxime, which an Heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror did ſo much admire, ſaying, He received it from Chriſtians, <hi>What ye would have men do to you, do ye to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets,</hi> Mat. 7. 12. that is, All the duties commanded by the Law, or required by the Prophets, are comprized in this Maxim, <hi>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them:</hi> Oh the world would not be full of ſuch wickedneſs, unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as it is, if this were obſerved: And further mark, when our Saviour had preſſed them to earneſt prayer, and incouraged them therein, he addeth this as a neceſſary condition to their prayers: So that let men be never ſuch Angels in duties and expreſſions, let them pretend never ſo much Piety and Religion, if they walk not by this rule, they follow not Chriſts directions: Chriſt therefore he hath onely given us general rules of Righteouſneſs, and for the particulars, he doth command Chriſtians to obey and ſubmit to the wholeſom Laws of that place where they are; as <hi>Rom. 13. Pay tribute to whom tribute, cuſtom to whom cuſtom:</hi> And this the Scripture doth often preſs, that none might think that the freedom they had by Chriſt, did take them off from Humane Obligations and Relations: This was a great temptation, they thought becauſe they were <note place="margin">Freedom by Chriſt takes no man off from Humane Obligations.</note> Chriſtians, and made free by Chriſt, that this alſo did take them off from obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Civil Magiſtrates, and from the Laws they lived under: No, the Scripture is diligent to teach this, That Chriſtianity and the Goſpel doth not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh Political and civil Government, but rather greatly advanceth it as an inſtitution of God, preſſing obedience thereunto for conſcience ſake.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have opened unto you the fountain and riſe of all Righteouſneſs and Equity between man and man.</p>
                  <p>Now let us conſider, what are the grounds why converted perſons are tender <note place="margin">Reaſons of the Doctrine.</note> to do what is juſt and righteous; yea, the Doctrine may be heightned, They are not onely tender about righteous things, but they are very conſcionable to do them, though to their external loſs. The Pſalmiſt deſcribing who ſhall aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend into the holy hill of Sion, a type of Heaven, giveth ſuch Characters, moſt of which relate to duties of honeſty and righteouſneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. 2. 3, 4. Verity in words of aſſertion, and veracity in Promiſes and Oathes. Our Saviour is large <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. in convincing and heightning thoſe duties againſt Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Adultery, Perjury, condemning all the ſubtil diſtinctions the Phariſees had invented to palliate their guilt. And you may read of <hi>Zacheus,</hi> when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, the firſt thing that works upon his conſcience is, to reſtore fourfold where he had wronged any: He went above the command of God, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired not ſo much; but a godly man is ſo tender in matters of wrong and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, that he had rather do above then under his duty.</p>
                  <p>Well, Let us ſee what is the cauſe of tenderneſs herein: And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe this new heart promiſed in the Text, is nothing but that which in</hi>

The Scripture doth much celebrate this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of Gods righteouſneſs, that his nature is righteous, his judgements, his word, his actions, yea all his ways: And now every converted man, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors to write after this copy: If then you ſee a man unjuſt, unconſcionable and falſe in his ways, ſay, How is the image of God in this man? how is God the father of ſuch an unrighteous man?

A man of conſcience is ſeen as well in humane affairs, as in religious; he abhorreth that ſpeech, <hi>Quicquid libet, licet,</hi> What is pleaſing to a mans deſire, that is alſo lawful: Conſcience is not onely ſeen in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion and matters of worſhip, but alſo in civil and worldly matters; yea how many caſes of conſcience do learned men handle, about the righteouſneſs and unrighteouſneſs of civil actions: <hi>De Jure, &amp; Juſtitia,</hi> what exact diſputes are there? do not then think, that Chriſt hath purchaſed any ſuch freedom, as that thou needeſt not make conſcience about civil things; its no matter for them, if thou keep the Doctrine and Worſhip of Chriſt: This is a ſinful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion; <hi>For the grace of God which bringeth ſalvation, hath appeared, teaching us to deny ungodly luſts, and to live righteouſly and ſoberly:</hi> So then, not onely the things of God are matter of conſcience, but the things of man; yea, the things of man work more upon a natural conſcience, becauſe they are diſcerned by the natural principles of reaſon: Hence the ſins of unrighteouſneſs and injuſtice, do more trouble the conſcience, if once awakened, then any other ſins: The pardon of them, or the ſenſe of the pardon, is difficultly obtained; and ſuch ſinners have much ado to get comforts, becauſe they have ſinned againſt the plain and clear light of Nature; and therefore for ſuch ſins that a natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience would condemn, a catalogue whereof the Apoſtle giveth in <hi>Rom,</hi> 1. 29, 30. 31. men have had more terrible wounds of conſcience then for other ſins: It muſt needs then be, that a converted perſon abounds in all righteouſneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his conſcience is tender, Its <hi>An heart of fleſh.</hi>

manner, to which ſo many great and glorious promiſes are annexed: Now you ſhall ſcarce finde any action ſo incouraged by God, nor any men ſo much as righteous men: If a righteous man have but a little eſtate, yet that little is better then many riches of the wicked, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 16. To have great eſtates, to have large revenues in this world, and not by righteous ways, by fraud, oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, violence, either by thy ſelf or Anceſtors, is like <hi>Ionahs</hi> gourd, that gave him ſome eaſe and ſhelter for a ſeaſon, but preſently there aroſe a worm with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it that conſumed it: So that a righteous man with his little Cottage, little morſel of bread, with his little cruiſe of drink, is better then rich <hi>Dives,</hi> that gets his wealth unjuſtly.

this time pitch onely upon the manner how God works this glorious mercie in us. And from thence obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That God in Converting and changing our hearts works after an omnipotent, effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> 
                     <hi>and irreſiſtible manner.</hi> When God ſpeaks to the ſoul to believe, to repent, to reform, it cannot, it will not but repent, he makes of unwilling willing: Even as at the firſt Creation God ſaid, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light:</hi> There was no power in the Creature to reject Gods Omnipotency: ſo it is, when God ſeeth a man wallowing in his bloud, or dead in his ſin: if he ſay, <hi>Ariſe and walk,</hi> Come forth out of the grave of ſinne, as he did to <hi>Lazarus,</hi> preſently the ſoul obeyeth. This point both Doctrinally, and Practically, is very neceſſary. The Orthodox handling of it, makes much for the excellent praiſe of grace, and the utter over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of thoſe dangerous and proud errors that advance Free-will, giving it either all, or part, in the work of converſion. Contrarie to the whole ſcope of the Scripture, which continually debaſeth man, diſcovering his impotencie and unworthines, but giving all to the power of God. Let us firſt explain this Doctrine, and then prove it. <note place="margin">The Doctrine explained. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, <hi>we diſtinguiſh between a man in his first Converſion, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the progreſſe of it.</hi> In the firſt moment and inſtant of Converſion, which is the taking away the heart of ſtone, and giving an heart of fleſh; there we ſay man <note place="margin">Man in the firſt work of converſion is paſſive and doth not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>o|perate.</note> is meerly a ſubject paſſive, and receiving the work of God, he doth not any wayes co-operate, he hath no ſtrength or power to joyn with God; but as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith well, Theſe things are wrought in <hi>nobis, ſine nobis,</hi> in us, yet without us, God works this ſpirituall life, this tender heart in us, without our help or ſtrength; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven as when Chriſt raiſed up any dead men, he put natural life into them, this was done in them, yet without their help; Life was put into <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> had no helping hand to effect this: I ſhall prove this in the grounds of the Doctrine, I onely now explain it. This then is the truth of God, and plainly grounded on Scripture, that man in the firſt inſtant of Converſion, hath no Free will, no power working with God, but is a meer paſſive ſubject, receiving the mighty work of God upon his ſoul: but if you conſider man in the progreſſe of Sanctification, thus having received this heavenly ſupernatural life, he is not a meer patient, but being acted and moved by God, he alſo acts and moveth: Then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we need grace to quicken and inliven thoſe principles of grace, as before was proved; but yet we doe not need a new life to be infuſed into us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Although this is the good truth of God, yet hereby we doe not take away</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>the nature of a man, and make him a beaſt,</hi> as the Adverſaries calumniate. Oh ſay they, this is to turn man into a ſtock or ſtone, to deprive him of reaſon and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of will. No, we deny the conſequence; for although we ſay, That he is thus <note place="margin">Hereby mans will is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away.</note> paſſive for the initial working of Grace; yet we ſay he hath his underſtanding, his reaſon ſtill, he hath a will ſtill; onely, to diſcern, or will what is good, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not: So then we deny not but a man hath underſtanding, hath a natural libertie of his will, he cannot be a man if he have not theſe: but yet in reſpect of that which is holy, ſo his mind is blind, his will is obſtinate, and rebellious againſt it. So that in man here are theſe three things; To be able to underſtand, to be able freely to will; this is of meer nature. To have a corrupt underſtanding, and a corrupt will, is of defiled nature. To underſtand and will what is good, is of ſanctified nature: So then, what is the true ſtate of the queſtion, not whether there be an underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and the natural faculty of Free-will in a man, or not. None denyeth that, every man hath Free-will in natural and civill actions; onely the queſtion is about the object of theſe, whether he hath power to underſtand or will things that are meerly ſpirituall and ſupernatural; and this the Scripture doth expreſly deny.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When we ſay, God doth work grace thus powerfully and irreſiſtibly, the meaning alſo is not, as if the heart of a man in converſion did not reſiſt and <note place="margin">3.</note> reject the work of the Spirit, in ſome meaſure, and in ſome degrees; for there is no queſtion but the heart of a man doth naturally refuſe and oppoſe the Spirit of God. <hi>Stephen</hi> told the Jews, <hi>They had alwayes reſiſted the Spirit of God,</hi> Acts 7.
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:30767:311"/>
and the word of God is ſaid to caſt down thoſe <hi>ſtrong holds, and every high thing that exalteth it ſelf againſt God,</hi> 2 Cor. 10. So that as there is a natural contrarietie, and active oppoſition between fire and water; thus there is a conſtant enmity and active reſiſting of Gods Spirit by our ſpirit; for if this combate and conflict remain ſtill in a godly man, how much more in natural men that are altogether carnal? You muſt therefore diſtinguiſh between a prevalent, conquering reſiſting, and a graduall: God in Converſion ſo works, that he takes away the prevalent, but not the gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all reſiſting. Though a man before he be converted, is froward and full of cavils and prejudices, is unwilling to be ſaved, cannot abide the truth, doth what he can to ſtifle all good motions; yet if he belong to Election, God will at laſt over-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter his heart, and make him of unwilling willing: his hard heart cannot refuſe this Converting grace, becauſe the firſt thing it doth, is to take away the hardneſſe of heart.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Therefore its not every kind of grace that a man may acknowledge is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> unleſſe it be ſuch a grace as is antecedently efficacious to our will, and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potently bowing, and changing of it. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid, That the <hi>Pelagians</hi> did uſe the word Grace, <hi>ad frangendam invidiam,</hi> to decline the hatred that their opinion might get; ſo thoſe that cry up Free-will: They will acknowledge grace, and God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid they ſhould ſpeak againſt grace: But thou muſt know, there hath been in this point an horrible abuſe of well-meaning men, by acknowledging grace, but not ſuch a grace as we told you, that is efficacious of it ſelf by its inward power, not depending upon mans will. <hi>Pelagius</hi> of old, when he ſaw his opinion was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally diſtaſted, as if he diſputed againſt grace; he then to avoid ſuch an <hi>odium,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to uſe the word, and to acknowledge it: inſomuch that he deceived an whole Counſel, by his ambiguities and generalities, who acquitted him: yea <hi>Auſtin</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf who was ſo diligent an oppoſer of him, was almoſt deceived by him. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any who diſpute for Free-will, ſpeak alſo of grace, &amp; they ſay they are for grace; remember its not every kind of grace that is enough, but ſuch as ſhall mightily change the heart; not that ſhall work with Free-will, but firſt make the will free, which was a Servant, and a Captive to luſt: <hi>Tunc eſt liberum, quando liberatum, Then are ye free if the Son hath made you free,</hi> John 8. 32.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, <hi>Although God thus omnipotently bow the heart, and grace be</hi> vorticordis, <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>as</hi> Auſtin <hi>called it, yet there is great uſe of the Miniſtrie;</hi> of exhortation, of reproof, of commands, of promiſes and threatnings; for preſently men are apt to cavill and ſay, If God work all, why then is the Miniſtry? Why are we exhorted, when we have no power! why doth God command, when we have no ability? For exhortation and the Miniſtry is neceſſary, becauſe its the inſtituted means, by which God will worke this, as Chriſt did not in vain ſay to <hi>Lazarus, Lazarus</hi> come forth, becauſe it was a practical powerful word, and thus it is here; the Miniſtrie ſpeaks not in vain, we exhort not in vain, becauſe in and by this, God inflames the heart, and quickens it to Good. And ſo the commands to turn to God, to love him above all things, are not in vain, becauſe they are not to demonſtrate our power but our duty. The Creditor may lawfully demand of his prodigal Debtor the ſum of money he oweth, though he be not able to pay, eſpecially we being full of ſelf-righteouſneſſe, carnal confidence, and earthly adherence, theſe commands are the more earneſtly to be preſſed, that we may be aſhamed and confounded.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, <hi>It cannot be denyed but that this Doctrine of Gods ſole power, and efficacie of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>Grace in Converſion, hath been and may be abuſed,</hi> and that two wayes, either to ſluggiſhneſſe and negligence, men thinking, that if God take away the ſtony heart, what need I care? I may ſit down and take my eaſe: Or to <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> ſuch as will not pray, nor go to the Ordinances, they will onely ſtay at home, and expect the Spirits immediate working on them; and theſe were two reaſons, ſaith <hi>Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius,</hi> why <hi>Pelagius</hi> a <hi>Brittan,</hi> otherwiſe an ingenious man and famous, as alſo very innocent in his life, did fall into his error on the other ſide. But there is no truth of God can be preached, but carnal hearts will abuſe it. <hi>Paul</hi> doth abundantly
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:30767:312"/>
teſtifie this, when he ſpeaks of thoſe corrupt inferences ſome made from his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of grace: and the beſt truths corrupted prove moſt dangerous: as when they did not uſe the Manna according to Gods Inſtitution, it degenerated into noiſome worms.</p>
                  <p>Let us diſcover the grounds of this truth: And Firſt, <hi>All thoſe places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which doe deſcribe the totall, and univerſall pollution of man,</hi> making him not <note place="margin">1.</note> ſo much a ſinner, as even ſin it ſelf; doth plainly argue, that Gods converting grace is all in all; that man is a meer patient, and cannot actively conſent to the leaſt good thing. Thus <hi>Gen. 6. The imagination of the thoughts of a mans heart are only evil, and that continually:</hi> What can be ſaid more, Every imagination or thought that ſtirreth in a man, its evil, and only evill, and that continually! How then can this conſent, or be active to God? ſo <hi>Epheſ. 2. You hath he quickned that were dead in ſins:</hi> What doth a dead man do to get life again? <hi>Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? Not one.</hi> That is, no man, God only doth: Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>A corrupt tree cannot bring forth good fruit;</hi> eſpecially <hi>Rom. 8. A naturall man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not the things of God, Neither can he;</hi> he doth not, and he cannot. See what pregnant places of Scripture here are; Mark them becauſe that unſavorie error doth ſo much ſpread. If theſe Texts be true, all our thoughts and affections are onely evill; we are dead in ſin, we do not, we cannot ſo much as perceive the things of God: how then dare any think of the power of nature, and her ability to what is holy?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>This is fully proved by thoſe excellent and empharicall ſimilitudes which are uſed to declare the work of Converſion;</hi> which the Spirit of God on purpoſe u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth <note place="margin">2.</note> to declare Gods glorious power in us. As its called often <hi>A Creation,</hi> and Grace is <hi>A new Creature:</hi> we are ſaid to be <hi>Created to good works.</hi> Now <hi>Creatio fit ex nihilo,</hi> Creation doth ſuppoſe nothing pre-exſiſtent, either phyſically or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally. Was the world when it was created any wayes co-operant to its Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Neither is it here. Remember then i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

A godly man is ſaid to be <hi>born of God.</hi> Now theſe are full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions to ſhew that we are not born by our free-will, or conſent, but by Gods ſole power; as <hi>John</hi> 1. Laſtly, its compared to the <hi>Reſurrection; You that were dead hath he quickned.</hi> Now was there ever any man that could raiſe up himſelf out of the grave, and give life to himſelf? yea <hi>Eph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>here ſaid to work in thoſe that believe. Now how can any man anſwer theſe compariſons the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture uſeth? for howſoever ſimiltudes muſt not be ſtretched beyond the ſcope of him that uſeth them: yet the Holy Ghoſt doth for this end uſe ſuch expreſſions, that we ſhould attribute all to God, be debaſed in our ſelves, ſaying, <hi>Not unto us Lord,</hi> not to our free-will or our power, <hi>but to thy Name be all glorie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>All thoſe places prove this, which take all ability of good from man, and attribute it wholly to God:</hi> So our Saviour likeneth every man out of <note place="margin">3.</note> him to a Branch ſeparated from the Vine <hi>John 15. The Branch out of the Vin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> can bring forth no fruit;</hi> Thus every man out of Chriſt: Hence our Saviour concludes, <hi>Without me ye can do nothing.</hi> He doth not ſay, You cannot do any great thing, but nothing: And again, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think one thought, viz.</hi> In reference to the good either of others, or of our ſelves. Thus you ſee how man is made utterly impotent. Well, then ſee thoſe places that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively attribute all to God; <hi>Its God that works in us both to will and to do.</hi> You ſee all is given to him. And again, <hi>What haſt thou that thou haſt not received?</hi> But above all, how plain is this <hi>Rom. 9. Its not of him that willeth, or him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.</hi> This is a noble place, for who is likely to have it, but him that willeth, or that runneth? yet it is not of him, but of him that ſheweth mercy; whereas if Free-will, or mans power had any co-partnerſhip in this work,
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:30767:312"/>
we might as well ſay, <hi>Its not of him that ſheweth mercy, but of him that willeth or run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</hi> So that this Doctrine robs God of all that honour and glory that is due to him both in the prayers and praiſes of his people. For how will the Patrons of Natures Free-will deport themſelves in this Duty? Muſt they not in effect come to this? Lord, I pray thee mollifie and ſoften my heart, if I will. Again, Lord I praiſe thee, that thou gaveſt me an heart to repent, when I conſented and was willing; And is not all this highly derogatory to Gods glory?

                  <p>Laſtly, If ſo be that the will and power of man, did make grace effectual to <note place="margin">4.</note> us, ſo that Gods grace ſhould not take away our ſtonineſſe, till we conſented, <hi>Then the greateſt glory of a mans Converſion would belong to him:</hi> For we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe God offering grace equally to the ſame men; They both live in the ſame Family, both under the ſame Miniſtery. Now what is the cauſe why one recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth the Word, and not the other? Shall we ſay, becauſe he by his free-will entertained the grace of God, and not the other? What derogation would this be to Gods glory? Doth not the Apoſtle ſay, <hi>Who hath made thee to differ from another?</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 7. Why was <hi>Peter</hi> converted, and not <hi>Judas?</hi> They both enjoyed the ſame means, they both ſaw the ſame wonderful miracles: Shall any man ſay, Becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> uſed his free-will well, and not <hi>Judas?</hi> This were to make <hi>Peter</hi> no more beholding to Chriſt then <hi>Judas</hi> was. Oh a gracious heart knoweth not how to digeſt ſuch preſumptuous opinions! God made me to differ from others, <hi>By the grace of God I am what I am.</hi> So then, have all theſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in your eyes, they are plain and eaſie; and then though error be never ſo ſubtilly painted, yet it will not make you inamoured with it, eſpecially if to all theſe places of Scripture, thou canſt ſet to thy own experience of Gods won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful change upon thee. Art not thou able to ſay, That though ten thouſand teachers ſhould come and preach free-will, yet thine own experience in thy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion will make thee not believe it, for thou wert ſo farre from conſenting or agreeing to the work of grace, that all thy ſhifts and care was how to put off the work of God? How often didſt thou labour to blinde thy own eyes, to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den thy own heart, how unwilling to be convinced, how ſorry to part with thy dear luſts, how often didſt thou put off and defer; ſaying, Yet a little more and ſtill a little more, that had not God by his mighty power opened thy heart, made thee of unwilling willing, to this very day thou hadſt ſtill been wallowing in thy bloud!</p>

                  <p>I Shall now make an end of this Text, whoſe matter like our Saviours loaves hath multiplied and increaſed in the breaking and diſtributing of it. The laſt thing obſervable is the manner of the conveyance and beſtowing of it, which is by an abſolute free promiſe, <hi>I will do thus unto you,</hi> here is nothing ſpoken of what they ſhould do, but what God will do; here is no ſpeech of their prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory diſpoſitions, but Gods gracious operation. Now although it be true, that immediately and directly this promiſe is made to the exiled Jews; therefore with the promiſe of Juſtification and Converſion, is joyned that of reſtitution into their own Land again, with all their former temporal mercies; yet the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> makes it plain, that this is an evangelical promiſe, or the Covenant of Grace for all ages in the Church, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 16. So that this promiſe is not to be underſtood of thoſe only in the Captivity, as the Remonſtrants would evade, whom God ſhould convert, but of all that in ſucceſſive ages, ſhall be brought home unto God. So that as <hi>Iſaac</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>a childe of the promiſe,</hi> becauſe he was not born by natural power, but by the meer promiſe and power of God, ſo all the godly are in this ſenſe as well as in another, like <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the children of the promiſe, being not born by the power of fleſh and bloud, but by vertue of this promiſe. It is this Text that giveth ſpiritual life to all that receive it. It is becauſe of this promiſe that the word of God hath any ſuccesful effect at any time.</p>
                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the Text runneth without any <hi>Ifs; God will take away the heart of ſtone,</hi> nothing ſhall fruſtrate his intention. The Lord hath ſaid it and it will come to paſſe. <hi>Iter ad gratiam</hi> is <hi>per gratiam, perque ipſam venitur ad ipſam.</hi> Grace makes way for it ſelf. As by the light of the Sun, we come to ſee the Sun, God doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offer grace to the heart, but ſanctifieth the heart to receive it. He doth not only give the oil but the cruiſe to receive it. He giveth the bread of life, and the ſtomack alſo to eat it.</p>
                  <p>To open this Doctrine, Conſider</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That a promiſe is a farre more comfortable thing then a meer prediction.</hi> God doth many times meerly fore-tell what he will do, but at other times he doth alſo promiſe what he will do: a prophecie of what will be, and a promiſe differ very much. This Text is not a meer prediction, or a meer prophecie, but it is a graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:30767:313"/>
promiſe: Now a Promiſe is only of that which is good, either temporal or ſpiritual, but a Prophecie or Prediction may be of that which is evil, as well as what is good: All the deſolations and calamities that came upon <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> were propheſied of; but we cannot ſay they were promiſed, for Promiſes are to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, as <hi>Paul</hi> excellently expreſſeth it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13. to ſhew how hearty, joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, glad and ready the heart ſhould be, to receive them: Oh remember, thou that art exerciſed with diffidence and diſcouragement, a promiſe is to be imbraced, as thou wouldeſt the deareſt, welcomeſt friend in the world! Again a Promiſe doth induce ſome tie and obligation in him that promiſeth, but ſo doth not a meer Prediction; and becauſe God promiſing cannot properly be ſaid to be bound to us, or tied to us; Therefore he is by his Promiſe a debtor to his own fidelity; he cannot deny himſelf or his own word, <hi>Reddis debita nulli debens,</hi> ſo that the ſoul urging God with a promiſe, may ſay, O Lord, it was in thy choice whether thou wouldſt do ſuch a thing or no, but ſince thou haſt promiſed it, and the word is gone out of thy mouth; Thy truth, thy conſtancy, thy fidelity muſt needs make good thy Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The Promiſes of God as for the matter of them they are two fold,</hi> ſome <note place="margin">2. Of Promiſes.</note> are temporal, and ſome are ſpiritual; ſo for the manner they are either Abſolute or Conditional; Abſolute Promiſes are ſuch as God hath made, and he will ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill, though we believe not at all. Such Promiſes doe not depend upon any Grace in us fore-going, neither doe they ſuppoſe any good qualification in us; Thus that temporal promiſe, that God will not drown the world, is abſolutely determined, though men do not believe it, yet God will make it good: So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9 The promiſe of ſending a Chriſt, a <hi>Meſſias</hi> into the world, was an Abſolute Promiſe. The calling of the Gentiles, and the calling of the Jewes again after the deſtruction of the Gentiles: Theſe are abſolutely promiſed. For as God hath ſome abſolute Threatnings for a deſtruction of a people; and then though there were <hi>Noah, Job</hi> and <hi>Daniel, they were not able to deliver that Land;</hi> ſo he hath many abſolute Promiſes, which all the wickedneſſe and unbelief of men ſhall not make void; and of theſe Abſolute Promiſes it is that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He is faithfull and cannot deny himſelf,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 13. and that our unfaithfulneſſe ſhall not make void the faith of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 3. For it is plain in many Promiſes, if we doe not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve God doth not fulfill them; as if we do not believe, we cannot be juſtified: but he ſpeaks there of ſuch abſolute Promiſes, as God will certainly accompliſh, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away all obſtructions that hinder.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There are Conoitional Promiſes, but that muſt be underſtood in a right ſenſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, not as if there were any Conditions to be performed by our ſtrength and power, as if theſe Conditions were cauſes and merits of the grace promiſed. No, they are onely Qualifications of the ſubject, without which he could not be partaker of the grace promiſed. Thus Juſtification is promiſed to Faith, pardon of ſinne to Repentance, overcoming of temptations to him that perſevereth, growth and increaſe of grace to him that improveth the grace he hath, and finally glorifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is promiſed to him only that is ſanctified, Here you ſee are ſome Promiſes made onely to ſuch as have grace already, Grace is the Condition for Grace, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is no Condition or Qualification required, which is not the Abſolute Gift of God at firſt; for although Juſtification be promiſed to him that believeth; If you ask, How a man comes to believe, here that we may not ſunne <hi>in infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> we muſt ſay it is abſolutely promiſed and wrought by God himſelf. I doe not here curiouſly diſpute about a Qualification and a Condition, nor of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Conditions; that is to be expected in the controverſal part. Now this Promiſe in the Text, is of the former ſort, an Abſolute Promiſe, making way for its own ſelf; As Kings uſe to carry their own Furniture for their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment; So it is here, Grace doth qualifie and worke the very ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall preparations ſo, that all is from God in a Promiſe. Nothing is our
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:30767:314"/>
plea, but a Promiſe; all our ſpiritual riches and treaſures are bound up in a Promiſe.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, let us conſider what is comprehended in this, when <note place="margin">What is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this free gift. 1.</note> we ſay, <hi>Converſion is abſolutely promiſed to the Converted,</hi> and that implieth:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The free grace of God beſtowing this ineſtimable benefit, <hi>Where he pleaſeth,</hi> and <hi>When he pleaſeth.</hi> Who can give any reaſon, why God takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſtony heart, and doth not <hi>Eſaus?</hi> Who can give a reaſon, why God ſoftens <hi>Peters</hi> heart, and not <hi>Iudas,</hi> but onely the meer grace and good pleaſure of God? See <hi>Paul</hi> Rom. 11. even raviſhed with the depth of Gods unſearchable wiſdome in this matter; and Chriſt himſelf greatly affected herein, <hi>Matth. 11. I thank thee, O Father, that thou hast revealed theſe things to babes, and hidden them from the wiſe.</hi> And <hi>To you it is given to underſtand, Matth. 13. but not to others.</hi> So that God making this abſolute Promiſe to ſome, and not to all, doth thereby make his free grace perſpicuous, that every mouth may be ſtopped that would boaſt of it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It ſuppoſeth, that we cannot ſo much as prepare, and fit our ſelves to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>receive Grace.</hi> God findes an heart of ſtone in every man, and a ſtone is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable. It was a Doctrine received a long while, <hi>Facienti quoá in ſe est, Deus dat Gratiam,</hi> though differently explained. Let a man doe what he can by naturall ſtrength and power, and then God will vouchſafe Grace and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall Mercies to him; yea this is too much divulged at this very day; let a man uſe his Naturals well, and God will give Supernaturals; but firſt there is no ſuch Promiſe in all the Scripture; you cannot in all the Scripture finde any Promiſe of Grace made to Nature, or the improvement of Nature; God no where ſaith, Doe as much as you can, what you are able by your own power, and then I will come and help you. There is no ſuch Promiſe in Scripture, but either it is abſolute, as you have heard, or elſe Conditional to ſome Grace wrought by God already in us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>This Promiſe is of a moſt excellent and precious Nature, it farre</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>exceeds all temporall Promiſes:</hi> Should God promiſe thee all the glory of the World, all that thy heart could in this life deſire, yet it is nothing to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a new Heart. Hence <hi>Peter</hi> cals them <hi>Precious Promiſes,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. <hi>whereby we are made partakers of the Divine Nature.</hi> God to this people in Captivity, promiſeth a new and a tender heart, as that which would qualifie or put a luſtre upon all other Mercies; Their return from Captivity, Their enjoying of their former Houſes and Mercies again would be nothing, if God gave not this Mercy alſo; Oh then that the hearts of men were made more ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and wiſe, to look after and prize this Promiſe; Let thy Condition be never ſo miſerable, thy ſtate never ſo diſtreſſed, yet if under this Promiſe, thou art in an Ark, when others are toſted up and down in the uncertain waves of this world. Even the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> that was called Bleſſed among Women, was more bleſſed that Chriſt was ſpiritually formed in her heart, then that the body of Chriſt was corporally faſhioned in her Wombe: Oh then! How wretched is thy eſtate even in the midſt of all earthly proſperity? when thou canſt ſay, Theſe new houſes, theſe new honours are mine, but thou canſt not ſay, This new heart is mine.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>This Abſolute Promiſe is ſure and certain:</hi> For there is Truth in God, <note place="margin">4.</note> and ſo he cannot lie; and there is Power in God, and ſo there cannot be any thing to hinder him, <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall ſooner paſſe away, then one Iowa or Tittle of this Promiſe fall to ground.</hi> How angry was God with <hi>Sarah,</hi> becauſe through unbelief ſhe laughed when God told her in her Old-age, ſhe ſhould conceive and bring forth a Childe? Do not thou think thy heart, thy luſts are too ſtrong, too naught for God to conquer and ſubdue? Now the ground why this Promiſe is ſo ſure, and cannot be fruſtrated, is, becauſe it is the execution of Gods Election from
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:30767:314"/>
all Eternity; and the Election of God, that is Abſolute, and that cannot be fruſtrated; Reade <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. where the Apoſtle in a grave and profitable way handling this ſublime Myſtery of Predeſtination; he argueth, That Gods Will and Purpoſe muſt take effect, Election hath obtained, and it will obtain; If then the Election of God be Abſolute, and that muſt ſtand, then the Promiſe of Converſion, which is nothing but a gracious Manifeſtation of this Election, muſt alſo be Abſolute. And this ſhall ſuffice for clearing the Nature of this Abſolute Promiſe; but becauſe this Doctrine is ſubject to carnall Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, I ſhall Anſwer one or two Objections which a froward Heart not humbly ſubmitting to the Authority of Scripture, is apt to raiſe. And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It may be ſaid, If this Promiſe of Converſion be Abſolute, God <note place="margin">Object. 1.</note> will work it, and there is no Condition on our part, that we can by our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture performe: <hi>Then what need we come to hear the Word preached?</hi> What need we waite on the Ordinances? if God will take away the heart of ſtone, he will do it though we be eating and drinking, and making merry, as well as if we be praying and hearing the Word preached. But take heed of ſuch deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive concluſions, for they do not follow from this truth. For</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Though we ſay it be an Abſolute Promiſe, yet the meaning is not, as if</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> 
                     <hi>it were accompliſhed without ſuch means God hath appointed.</hi> Therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe may be ſaid to be Abſolute, either in oppoſition to Conditional, as if it required ſomething as a Condition to be done on our part, and in this ſenſe it is Abſolute; or elſe it may be called Abſolute, as it doth oppoſe that which is to be ordered by ſome means, and in this ſenſe it is not Abſolute. <hi>Paul</hi> had abſolutely fore-told, That none in the Ship that were with him ſhould die; yet he alſo ſaid, That they muſt uſe the meanes, keep in the Ship. And thus God told <hi>David</hi> many times before he went to the Battel, That he ſhould have the Victory, yet he was carefull to order his Army, and to prepare the Souldiery: So that Gods Promiſes though they are many times Abſolute, yet they alſo include Meanes for that end. Now there are Meanes of two ſorts, The one External having no immediate influence upon Grace, onely it is the neceſſary way that God hath commanded every one to walk in, and ſuch are coming to the Ordinances; and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word. A man hath Free-will or Power of Nature to doe this, as any other civil Actions. Indeed to hear with Faith, to hear with godly Attention and brokenneſſe of Spirit, that he cannot; but ſimply to come to hear, and in a general manner to attend to what is delivered, that by Nature he can doe; Now even this very hearing, and this bodily preſence God hath required, as a Meanes wherein he will diſpenſe his Grace; So that whoſoever doth wilfully neglect the uſe of theſe, cannot promiſe to himſelfe any Converſion; yea he may certainely conclude God will not convert him; ſo that here is no place for thy prophane Cavil; What need I come and hear? what need I frequent preaching? Yes, every way; for though God hath abſolutely promiſed this Mercy, yet it is in the uſe and exerciſe of theſe Meanes: Oh then that thoſe who cuſtomarily and wilfully abſent themſelves from the preaching of the Word, would conſider, that they turn their back upon God, and in effect ſay, They will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, We will not have this new Heart, this new Life. If a man ſhall wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſe to eat or drink, will he not be accounted a ſelf-murderer? and if thou careleſly or obſtinately refuſeſt the Word of life, will not God judge thee for a ſelf-damner?</p>
                  <p>But then in the next place, <hi>There are formall and internall Meanes that doe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>immediately receive Chriſt in the ſoul,</hi> ſuch as Faith, or hearing in Faith, and theſe a man hath no power of himſelf to performe, Faith being the
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:30767:315"/>
gift of God. So then although internal Meanes of obtaining Chriſt, cannot by natural ſtrength be performed, yet there are external Meanes, which who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhall refuſe, he doth reject the counſel of God, and pronounceth himſelf unworthy of Salvation. Therefore harbour no more ſuch thoughts, unleſs thou wilt violently throw thy ſelf into the mouth of hell.</p>
                  <p>But ſecondly, It may be ſaid, <hi>If Gods Promiſe of Converſion be Abſolute, This is diſcouraging and may eaſily caſt men into deſpair;</hi> for though I deſire, and groan <note place="margin">Object. 2.</note> after Converſion, yet if I be not in this Abſolute Promiſe, I can never be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of it.</p>
                  <p>But firſt conſider, <hi>Though it be Abſolute, yet it is alſo Indefinite, it doth not exclude any particular man;</hi> So that no man in the world living under <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> the meanes of Grace, can truely ſay, he is not intended in this Promiſe, as well as others. Seeing therefore God hath no where excluded thee by name, there is no clauſe that ſhuts thee out; it is a grievous ſinne in thee to ſhut thy ſelf out. So then, Know thoſe dejecting and diſcouraging thoughts they ariſe from Hell; It is the Devil and thy own black heart, not this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine that diſcourageth. If there were a Malefactour among many others, and the Magiſtrate ſhould make an indefinite promiſe that he would ſpare them and pardon them, and doth not by name exclude any man, would any be ſo injurious to himſelf, as to queſtion, whether he be intended in the pardon or no? No leſſe injurious art thou to thy ſelf, in diſputing againſt this promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>If thou liveſt under the means of Grace, and where the word of Life is tendered, then thou haſt much more cauſe to hope that this Promiſe of Converſion</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>doth belong to thee.</hi> Indeed all thoſe who ſit in Heatheniſh darkneſſe, to whom the Goſpel was never yet made known, they are a hopeleſs people, while ſo; there is no Promiſe without the Church of God: But to thoſe who have the grace of God tendered to them, they may plead this Argument, Lord, thou haſt given us the outward means, we have the Miniſtery, that ſounds daily in our ears, Oh give us the inward Grace alſo!</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>If thou art one who groaneſt and deſireſt after Converſion, and art afraid leſt God hath excluded thee,</hi> be of good comfort, <hi>for thoſe ſighs and pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>after Grace, are a ſure ſign that thou art included, yea that this work of a new heart, and a tender heart is already begunne in you.</hi> Where you hear a Sigh or a Groan in a man, it is a ſigne there is a naturall life; and ſo where there are inward Groans and Affections for this new heart, there are the beginnings, and the foundation is already ſaid, <hi>God will not break the bruiſed Reed, nor quench the ſmoaking Flax.</hi> Even hunger and thirſt hath a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of being ſatisfied, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. Therefore let this turn thy water into wine preſently.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Although the Promiſe of Converſion be in a well explained ſenſe Abſolute, yet there is no man damned that would have been converted, onely he</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>wanted the Promiſe, God would not put his name in there, and that is the cauſe of his utter periſhing.</hi> No, this is a firm truth, <hi>O Iſrael, thy deſtruction is of thy ſelf;</hi> And <hi>As I live, ſaith God, I will not the death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould live. Turn ye, turn ye, Why will ye die?</hi> This is a ſure truth, Every mans Damnation is of his own ſelf; he doth wilfully and with delight go on in deſtructive wayes, he cannot ſay, Lord, I would have been converted, but the Abſoluteneſs of thy Election, or thy Promiſe hindered, yea a mans own wilful luſts they deſtroy him: Inſomuch that were it not for this Promiſe of God none at all would be converted: It is well we are not left to Free-will, for then not one would be converted: And the Adverſaries to this Opinion cannot inſtance in one Heathen ever ſince the world was made, that did uſe his Naturals ſo well, that God vouchſafed Supernaturals; inſomuch
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:30767:315"/>
that the Doctrine of Free-will may well caſt a man into Deſpair; for if my Converſion cannot be wrought till I go along with God in it, I am for ever undone.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Let it be granted that there are ſome Difficulties in this Doctrine, that humane reaſon cannot untie all the knots,</hi> yet this is no more then <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledged, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. and reproveth man for ſuch bold Diſputing with God: Gods wayes are wiſe and juſt, even when they are hidden and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret to us. There is no end when humane wiſdom talketh againſt heavenly Diſpenſations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe.</hi> Is this Promiſe, though Abſolute, yet ordered in the uſe of means to be accompliſhed? Then be diligent in hearing the Word: Oh pray that this new heart may at laſt be found in thee! Oh why is it that we ſhould leave this Text before every Auditor finde the power of it upon his ſoul! Oh that the leaving of this Text might not leave one carnal ſtony heart! Oh that as we have done the Text, ſo God had done this work in you! But oh our barrenneſs, our bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs! Oh the juſt anger and wrath of God againſt many perſons, to whom God ſaith, Let them alone in their ſins!</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E have conſidered the Work of Grace under ſeveral emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Titles that the Scripture giveth to it. The next I ſhall pitch upon, is, <hi>Vocation</hi> or <hi>Calling;</hi> for Converſion is often notified by this term. And this Text will afford a juſt occaſion to treat of it. To underſtand the Text, let us conſider the divine and admirable Connexion of this verſe with the precedent Matter at the 28<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe. The Apoſtle after other Conſolations adminiſtred to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted believers, he giveth them this ſoveraign Cordial, <hi>All things work together for good to them that are called according to Gods purpoſe.</hi> This promiſe or faithful ſaying is enough to bear up the heart of any troubled believer, for what can he deſire more? If this will not ſatisfie, what can? Though thy adverſities, temptations are called evils in reſpect of ſenſe, yet in reſpect of thy ſpiritual advantage, ſo they are good adverſities, they are good evils without any contradiction; and ſee how emphatical every word is. We know, not only <hi>Paul,</hi> but all the godly by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and wiſe comparing of things together, come to know this. This is ſuch a truth, that no Chriſtian ſhould be ignorant of; And then <hi>All things;</hi> he doth not ſay Some, but all things; not only proſperity, not only ſpiritual mercies, but even all miſeries and afflictions whatſoever, yea ſins themſelves by Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe being repented of, make them more wary and humble; as fire driveth out
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:30767:317"/>
pain by fire: and then <hi>they work together;</hi> though this or that particular affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it ſelf may ſeem to make thee worſe, to cauſe thy Sunne to goe many degrees backwards, yet all together promote thy good; They do that in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tion, which a ſimple aſpect would not do. So that this true and faithful ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing if imbraced by all acceptation of believing, is enough to make a man in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual transfiguration. Such a beleever may truly ſay, <hi>Soul, take thy ſpiritual eaſe, for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ere is much ſpiritual good treaſured up for thee;</hi> but this bread is only given to children; This pearl is not caſt to dogs and ſwine; for in the next place we are told who they are, to whom this priviledge belongs, and they are ſet out,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By their Duty or Grace, <hi>They love God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. By Gods mercy vouchſafed to them, <hi>They are called according to his purpoſe.</hi> Whereupon the Apoſtle makes a golden chain of all the cauſes of Salvation, inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably linked together, that none may be taken away one from another. It was a ſaying that A man might ſooner wreſt <hi>Hercules</hi> his Club out of his hand, then divide one of <hi>Homers</hi> verſes from another, the matter was ſo dependant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed together; but certainly all theſe cauſes are ſo divinely joyned together, that none can part them. And the firſt Round in this Chain is Gods fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or rather Gods fore-acknowledging; For by fore-knowledge is not meant any preſcience or previſion of ſuch as would uſe their free-will and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral power well. No, that to repugneth the whole currant of the Scripture, which makes all good works the fruit and effect of Predeſtination, not the motive or cauſe of it, otherwiſe it would be Poſtdeſtination, rather then Predeſtination; but to fore-know is as much as to approve of, and to love, according to that rule, Words ſignifying acts of the underſtanding, are many times put for the conco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitant and ſubſequent affections and effects thereof. Thus the ſimple word <hi>To know,</hi> is many times put for approbation, care and love. Thus <hi>Pſal. 1. The Lord knoweth the way of the righteous.</hi> John 10. <hi>I know my Sheep;</hi> and the compound to <hi>fore-know</hi> alſo is uſed in this ſenſe, <hi>Rom. 11. God hath not cast away the people whom he for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>-knew, i. e.</hi> did approve and love. So 1 <hi>Pet. 1. 2. Elect according to the fore-knowledge of God;</hi> And ſo it is applied to Chriſt <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. in that Chapter. Upon this fore-knowledge ſucceeds Predeſtination, and theſe are acts of God from all eternity; and from theſe as the fountain, ſtreams the firſt effect in time, and that is Calling, <hi>Whom he hath predeſtinated he hath called.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a twofold calling, one External only, conſiſting in the tender and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <note place="margin">A two-fold Calling.</note> of grace, inviting of men to come in; in which ſenſe our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen.</hi> The other internal and efficacious alſo, when God with the outward offer changeth the heart, making it to imbrace Chriſt; and in this ſenſe it is ſaid here <hi>Called;</hi> upon this follow two further benefits, Juſtified and Glorified. It is not my purpoſe to inſiſt on them, nor to diſpute the order, Whether Calling or Juſtification precede; or, Whether Sanctification be inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in this word Calling. Theſe things are not within my compaſſe; onely take notice of this, That the phraſe in the Preterperfect Tenſe, <hi>He hath justified,</hi> doth not imply a Juſtification from all eternity, no more then that we are called and glorified from eternity; but the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the paſt time, either to ſhew the certainty of it; or elſe becauſe we are glorified already in Chriſt our Head, and have the ſure pledges of it in this life; or elſe becauſe he had begun in that Tenſe when he ſpake of Predeſtination, and could uſe no other, he continued the ſame expreſſion in the other priviledges.</p>
                  <p>The Text thus opened, I come to that particular benefit I intend, <hi>viz. Called;</hi> and for the ſence of the word, you muſt know it ſignifies to have a being and exiſtence, yet ſuch, as that it is celebrated and publickly taken notice of. <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed are the Peacemakers, for they ſhall be called the ſons of God;</hi> Matth. 5. 9. <hi>And, behold what love he hath ſhewn, that we ſhould be called the ſons of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 1. And we read of a three-fold Calling;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That external and civil condition of life which a man lives in; in
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:30767:317"/>
which ſenſe every one is bid to <hi>continue in the calling he is called unto,</hi> 1 Cor 7. 20.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, For any ſpiritual function or office in the Church. Thus the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſhip is often ſtiled a <hi>Calling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And laſtly, for that grace of God whereby he cals us out of the ſtate of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Paganiſm and prophaneneſſe, to a ſtate of truth, godlineſſe and glory; which is either meerly external, vouchſafed even to hypocrites and reprobates, or internal, beſtowed on the godly only; and this the Apoſtle meaneth in the Text. From whence obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That whom God hath predeſtinated from all eternity, and will glorifie in the world</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> 
                     <hi>to come, he doth in this life powerfully call out of their ſins and ignorance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As they are regenerated, or converted, ſo they are a called people: I ſhall firſt treat of this powerful calling which the godly onely have: And to conſider this diſtinctly, let us open the nature of it:</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. In reſpect of the efficient cauſe. <note place="margin">Effectual Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation opened. 1. In the efficient cauſe God. 1.</note>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. The inſtrumental.</item>
                     <item>3. The nature of it.</item>
                     <item>4. The terms from whence we are called, and to which we are called.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p>And for the <hi>efficient Cauſe,</hi> God is he that calleth us with this powerfull live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly calling: and herein conſider,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The omnipotent power and ſtrength of God, who by his word can make ſuch a wonderful change;</hi> He doth but call, and man who is naturally ſuch an enemy and adverſary to what is good, doth preſently become a friend; ſo that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture expreſſing this work of converſion, doth therein allude to Gods Creation at firſt, when by his Word all things were made, he ſaid, <hi>Let there be light, and there was light; Verba Dei ſunt opera,</hi> ſaid <hi>Luther,</hi> Gods words are works; this made the Apoſtle ſay, He calleth thoſe things that are not, as if they were, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. Gods call gives a ready being to thoſe things that had no exiſtency at all before. So that herein is declared the ſoveraign power of God; God at the firſt Creation called for thoſe things to appear which lay in the dark womb of nothing, and they preſently came out; Even as if a Maſter ſhould give a call to his ſervant who ſtands in the next room ready to receive his commands. Behold then and admire at the great power of God, who hath made this wonderfull change on thee. Chriſt did no ſooner call from Heaven to <hi>Paul,</hi> but he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly anſwers, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> So that Gods call even to the deaf is not in vain, becauſe at the ſame time he giveth ears to hear. Oh then let the godly conſider, How comes grace, any godly affections or deſires to be in thy heart? It had been impoſſible for ſuch things to lodge in thy ſoul, had not God given this mighty call, ſaying, Let there be faith, repentance, godly ſorrow; and preſently there is.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Take notice of the full ſufficiency and happineſſe of God, who thus cals</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>thee to communion with him.</hi> It is not for any want or indigency, that day by day he thus cals and invites thee to come in: No, God is bleſſed, and all-ſufficient: had he not created Angels, or the viſible world, he had been gloriouſly happy in the enjoying of himſelf, but yet out of his goodneſs he is willing to invite and call in men, that they alſo may be made happy; Chriſt in his Parable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed this, when he ſent out his ſervants to invite men unto the feaſt, and when they refuſed then he ſent for the lame and blinde, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. 21. ſuch as he could have no need of, but they did exceedingly need him; and ſo there is no day that God ſends us his ſervants to invite you to this ſpiritual feaſt, but this conſideration ſhould wound thee and make thee aſhamed: Oh why doth God thus call me? Why am I thus invited? Is not God happy and glorious enough? though I periſh and be damned in my ſins? <hi>What is man, Lord, and the ſonne of man that thou ſhouldſt be thus mindfull of him?</hi> as if God could not be a God, a happy, bleſſed God, unleſs thou alſo wert brought into happineſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="584" facs="tcp:30767:318"/>
Thirdly, <hi>In Gods calling of us, conſider the freeneſſe of his grace, and the abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of his purpoſe and good pleaſure therein.</hi> He cals ſome, and leaves others; yea the farre greater part of mankinde, and thoſe who have the greateſt pomp and glory in this world, on whom the eyes of the world are moſt open. Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Not many noble, not many wiſe hath God called,</hi> 1 Cor. 1. 28. but the poor and deſpicable things of the world hath God choſen. Indeed God partly by his Word to ſome, and partly by the works of Creation to others, hath left every man without excuſe; he hath given to all men pregnant witneſſes of his goodneſſe, wiſdom and power, that they might ſeek after him; but this is not the call of grace that is the fruit of Election; for that takes effect and cannot be totally and finally reſiſted; Thou therefore who haſt been thus called, cry out, <hi>Oh the depths and unſearchable riches of Gods mercy!</hi> There are <hi>two in a bed, one is called the other is left: Two in a family, one is taken and the other left.</hi> As in <hi>Pauls</hi> Converſion, when there was a voice from Heaven, <hi>Paul</hi> heard diſtinctly, but his companions did not; ſo in the ſame Sermon, which is Gods call, one heareth it diſtinctly, receiveth the power of it in his heart, knoweth the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental meaning of it; but others hear only a general ſound, they underſtand nothing of it. Certainly this freeneſs of Gods grace in calling thee and not others, who happily have not been ſuch ſinners as thou haſt been, never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſuch foul abominations as thou haſt done; that hath not called others of better parts, abilities and greater wiſdom, who thereby if converted, might have brought more glory and honour to God then thou ever art likely to doe. This free arbitrary grace (I ſay) of which a man can give no reaſon in the world but his own good pleaſure, may juſtly fill thy heart with all aſtoniſhment and raviſhing amazements. This is the myſtery of Gods grace that thou ſhouldſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be contemplating and beholding, Oh Lord! Why am I called and not another? Why doth the Word of God come home to my ſoul, and others feel and underſtand nothing at all? It was a great favour of God to little <hi>Samuel, 1 Sam.</hi> 3. 9. when God called him twice or thrice, and did reveal his will to him, and took no notice of <hi>Eli</hi> the Prieſt and Judge in <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Oh hath not the Lord done as wonderfully in viſiting thy ſoul, calling unto thee often, when thoſe of greater parts, and greater pomp, and glory are paſſed by?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>This Call of God it doth alwayes ſpeed.</hi> There is a preſent hearing and obedience in thoſe that are thus called. Indeed there is an outward calling, and many who are ſo called do ſinfully and wickedly reject it, and of ſuch, few are ſaved comparatively; but of thoſe who are called according to his purpoſe, as the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh, there God giveth a ready ear, a ready heart; that they ſtand up preſently and ſay, <hi>Behold I come to do thy will; My ears haſt thou opened; Thy Law is written within my heart:</hi> So that however for a long time thou maieſt not either underſtand this Call of God, as little <hi>Samuel</hi> did not, but give a little liſtning, and then lie down to ſleep again; after that a ſecond time to give a little liſtning, and then lie down to ſleep again; ſo thou have ſome affections and deſires, then preſently they give over, and thou goeſt to thy luſts and thy ſins again, then God a ſecond, a third, yea many a time, who knoweth how often, gives thee further calling, and that makes thee more ſtartle and more awakened, but thou doeſt again return to thy old luſts, thy old follies, thy old diſtempers, yet at laſt God takes away all that blindeneſſe and wilfulneſſe which is upon thee, and makes thee readily and fully give up thy ſelf to obey him.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>This Call of God is very various in reſpect of the time when it is vouchſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed to them:</hi> Some are called in their infancy, ſome in their youth, ſome in their old-age; even as in the Parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. ſome were hired in to worke in the Vineyard at the ninth, others at the eleventh hour; not that this ſhould make a man procraſtinate and put off his converſion to God; for by the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> hour in that Parable, is not meant the later days of a mans life, but the later days of the
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:30767:318"/>
world; The Jews they were called at the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> hour, the Gentiles they were called at the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, yet God giveth the ſame Heaven to both, that is the proper meaning of that Parable. Indeed we have an inſtance of one, and but of one called at the end of his days, the Thief on the Croſſe, of whom <hi>Auſtins</hi> obſervation is obvious; There is one, that none ſhould deſpair, thinking it impoſſible for him to be converted, who hath put off this work till death hath arreſted him: and yet it is but one, that none may preſume: Of many men that have poiſoned themſelves it may be one doth recover, but this would be no encouragement to thee to ſwallow down poiſon: How many dreadfull and ſad examples maiſt thou ſee and hear of thoſe who as they lived wickedly, ſo died as deſperately? Howſoever therefore Gods calling be various, to ſome ſooner, to ſome later, yet happy are they who are called out of ſinne betimes in their younger years, they have leſſe wounded their conſciences, diſhonoured God, and they have the longer time to do him ſervice, and the beſt ſervice: Oh how happy is it when the daies of thy youth have been filled with the ſtrength and power of God! Oh therefore that the younger ſort of people, would expect and look after this call of God! Do not think its for old men ready to drop in the grave, for them only to repent, and to leave off their ſins, but you muſt enjoy the pleaſures and luſts of youth: Oh <hi>Remember thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth!</hi> When God cals thee in thy tender years, thou wilt not then make thoſe ſad ſhipwracks of thy ſoul, as others doe.</p>
                  <p>In the next place conſider, <hi>The inſtrument of Gods Call, and that is the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">11. In the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Gods word.</note> 
                     <hi>of the Word.</hi> You may ſay, Where doth God call, and when doth he call, we have no immediate voice from Heaven ſpeaking to us, How then can this be? The anſwer is, God cals you by the Miniſters, we are Embaſſadors coming in his name to you; ſo that you who refuſe them ſpeaking the word of God, you refuſe God himſelf calling to you. They are the voice of God crying, <hi>Prepare ye a way for the Lord;</hi> ſo that every Sabbath-day God cals you by the Miniſters, and you that think that if you ſhould have an immediate voice from Heaven cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to you, then you would obey and ſubmit; know you would not do it, if you refuſe the word of God delivered to you by the Miniſtry: Our Saviour ſaid, <hi>That they who would not believe Moſes, nor the Prophets, neither would if one ſhould riſe from the dead, and come unto them,</hi> Luk. 16. 29. It is neither our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or ſpeaking, but Chriſt by us that you refuſe and contemn; and how great and farre your judgement will be who neglect this great ſalvation, the Scripture bids every man think within himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 3. Indeed there are many things have a voice to call us beſides the Word; The Heavens and all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſo many tongues calling unto us; The rod of affliction, that hath a voice, <note place="margin">The creatures afflictions.</note> and we are commanded to hear what that ſpeaks; but the preaching of the word that is the powerfull voice, and the immediate motions and inſpirations of the Spirit accompanying it, theſe give life and quickning in ſpeaking: That as God hath a voice of the Trumpet and the Archangel, to raiſe men from the dead; ſo he hath alſo of the Word, to raiſe men out of their ſecurity in ſinning. Thus you have the efficient and inſtrumental cauſe of Gods calling. Many practicall Uſes may be made of this: As</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To magnifie and adore the love of God to mankinde, that doth vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> ſuch a gracious and merciful call to man fallen. This is more then he hath done to the Apoſtate Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 16. To which of them hath he appointed a word of Miniſtery and Reconciliation? not only the Prieſt and the Levite, but even the good <hi>Samaritan</hi> hath paſſed by theſe, and taken no notice of them: yea come we to man, Is there not farre the greater number of mankinde, that though they have a witneſs enough to condemn them, yet have not the external offer and call of God? The name of Chriſt and faith hath not ſounded within their coaſts; yea come we cloſer ſtill, How many thouſands and thouſands are there who have the outward call, but are wholly deſtitute of the inward call? Now
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:30767:319"/>
if God paſs by ſo many thouſands of Angels, and ten thouſands of men, and give thee this inward call, May not this fill thy heart with hot burning love to God? Canſt thou contain thy ſelf? As a wicked tongue, ſet on fire from hell, doth alſo ſet the whole creation on fire; ſo thy tongue ſet on fire with this heavenly love, ſhould make thee cry out to all creatures, To bleſs God for his mercy. <hi>David</hi> had his heart thus burning within him, when he calls upon the whole creation, and every creature by name to praiſe God. The Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> fainted to hear the wiſdom, and behold all the glory of <hi>Solomon;</hi> how much rather may thy heart ſink within thee, through admiration of Gods love in this particular!</p>

Again, remember this time of Gods gracious calling is very uncertain; this may be the laſt day, the laſt hour: <hi>To day, if ye will hear, harden not your hearts;</hi> you have put off many days already, tremble exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, leſt this day of grace be ſetting in a black diſmal night.

                     <bibl>ROM. 8. 30.</bibl>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THe efficient and inſtrumental cauſe of this <hi>Divine Calling</hi> mentioned in the Text, hath already been declared. We come now to conſider, <hi>The nature</hi> wherein it conſiſts; and the terms <hi>from which, to which,</hi> in it: And firſt for the nature of it, becauſe you heard it was partly external, and partly internal; even as man conſiſts of an external body, and an internal inviſible ſoul; ſo this heavenly calling hath that which is viſible, ſounding into the ear, and that which is inviſible and internal, reaching with a mighty power, even to the heart.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe, I ſay, it conſiſts of theſe two parts, we muſt conſider the Nature <note place="margin">I. The nature of vocation. As external it lieth 1. princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in the preaching of the word.</note> of it firſt as external, and then as internal.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>And as its external, ſo it doth primarily and principally lie in the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the word:</hi> The merciful and gracious invitation of ſinners to come in by the Goſpel, is the very eſſence of external calling: So that the word of God preached to you, whether it be in Commands, Promiſes or Threatnings, is to
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:30767:319"/>
be received by you as the voyce and calling of God from heaven to you: The Scripture commanding to leave ſuch a ſin, and obedience to ſuch a duty; is as truly the voice and call of God, as any immediate extraordinary call that God e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver vouchſafed to any; its as truly and as really, and with as much faith to be obeyed, though it be not ſo immediately and miraculouſly: As for example, <hi>Paul</hi> had this wonderful voyce from heaven, <hi>Paul, Paul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> Now every prophane, ungodly man, hath as really Gods voyce from heaven by the word ſpeaking to him, <hi>Turn, turn ye, why will ye dye?</hi> Its ſaid, when <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> was ſo near its deſtruction, they had a call from heaven, ſaying, <hi>Migre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus hinc,</hi> Let us depart hence: No leſs doth every ungodly man hear every day, when he is bid to depart from iniquity, and have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs. Its noted as a great mercy of God to <hi>Lot,</hi> that he ſent an Angel to call him out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> when fire and brimſtone was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to be poured from heaven upon it; and whereas <hi>Lot</hi> delayed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, the Angel even pulled him out, who was unwilling for his own good; This is a fit repreſentation of our ſpiritual calling out of ſin; the Angels are the Miniſters of God, that cry daily, Come out of the world, leſt you partake of the judgements of the world; and men are ſo unwilling, they do ſo dearly love their <hi>Sodom,</hi> though it will coſt them fire and brimſtone, that we are to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel you out of it: This then is a main fundamental principle, introductory to our converſion, when we conſider God as ſpeaking and calling to us by his word, to look upon it as truly and really the call of God, as if there were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate voyces from heaven ſpeaking to us by name: <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. Chriſt is ſaid ſtill to ſpeak to us from heaven; And how is that but by the word? and the Scripture is called the <hi>The word of God;</hi> God ſpeaks it now, as well as at firſt when he commanded it to be written: Oh then tremble, leſt you ſhould be in the number of thoſe who reject God calling of you: Should God ſend innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company of Angels from heaven to you, to call you out of your luſts, to the ſtate of grace, it would not be more really (though more immediately) the voyce of God, then what we out of the word declare unto you: This then undoeth you, you do not believe God himſelf by the word ſpeaking to you, you do not think this is Gods voyce, that he ſpeaks thus and thus to me, and therefore you are ſtill ſetled in a willful way of ſinning. Now the word preached is Gods calling:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Inſtrumentally, as its the word of God, the word that comes out of his mouth: All the Miniſters of God, faithfully diſcharging their truſt, are voyces crying unto you, <hi>Prepare a way for the Lord;</hi> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to preach, is to be the Lords ſolemn Herald, to offer peace to Rebellious enemies, if they will come in; and if not, in a ſolemn and dreadful manner, to denounce his heavy wrath and curſe: Look not then on Miniſters in their Ambaſſage, as weak frail men, ſubject to the like paſſions with others, butas Ambaſſadors, as coming in the name of God, that cry out, Thus ſaith the Lord, Oh thou ſinner, waſh thee from thy iniquity; thus ſaith the Lord, and not man. And</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The word preached doth call men objectively; the matter of it is ſo precious, good, excellent and neceſſary, as that it doth ſtrongly invite every man. Some Grammarians ſay, That that which is good and excellent, is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, becauſe it doth <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, it doth call and invite men to be in love with it: This is ſure about the matter of Gods word; How Divine and Supernatural is it? what purity, what heavenly affections doth that require? inſomuch, that no humane precepts concerning piety and honeſty ever came near to the Bible: And than the good things promiſed, are wholly tranſcendent mans capacity; they are ſuch as never entered into the heart of man to conceive: Juſtification, the light of Gods countenance, Eternal happineſs and glory in heaven, were not men ſo bruitiſhly earthly, would raviſh them, and make them run after
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:30767:320"/>
them; as the Church ſaid <hi>Cant 1. 2. Becauſe of the ſavor of thy ointments, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do the virgins love thee:</hi> If therefore ye would conſider, both how great that infinite majeſty is, who doth call you; and what that bait is he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite you to, even great and admirable priviledges, this would excite in you ſuch vehement and impatient deſires after them, that all the luſts and pleaſures of ſin, would be accounted as droſs and noiſom vomit: Oh then think more and more, and conſider of this calling. Shall the Devil and luſts call, and thou runneſt after them, though into hells mouth? but God calleth, and thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſeſt him: <hi>Come unto me all ye that paſs by,</hi> ſaith the whoriſh woman; and in the ſame manner, every kinde of ſin, and how many venture into her ſnares! <hi>But come unto me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>all ye that labor, and you ſhall finde reſt unto your ſouls,</hi> Mat. 11. in this men are refractory.</p>
                  <p>In the Second place, <hi>The call of God conſiſts in thoſe things that are leſs prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,</hi> and ſuch, as without the former, would do no good; but when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>oyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note place="margin">2.</note> with it, is very ſubſervient and inſtrumental. And here we may ſpeak of three tongues calling aloud to us, two without us, and one within us; which I call external, though within us, becauſe of it ſelf it doth not internally change the heart of a man.</p>
                  <p>And the firſt leſs principal, <hi>Is the whole Creation:</hi> All the Creatures are like <note place="margin">The whole Creation.</note> like ſo many tongues, as they declare the Glory, Power and Wiſdom of God.</p>
                  <p>As for that dangerous opinion, that makes Gods calling of man to repentance <note place="margin">The voyce of the Creatures of it ſelf, not ſufficient to call men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</note> by the Creatures, to be enough and ſufficient, we reject, as that which cuts at the very root of free grace: A voyce, indeed, we grant they have, but yet they make like <hi>Pauls</hi> Trumpet, an uncertain ſound; men cannot by them know the nature of God and his Worſhip, and wherein our Juſtification doth conſiſt: Therefore whereas <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. the Pſalmiſt had ſpoken of the ſound of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and how they all declare the glory of God, he comes in the latter part to commend the Law of God, for that which hath ſpiritual effects indeed; <hi>viz.</hi> To convert the ſoul, and to forwarn from ſin: Thou canſt not then look up to heaven, or down to the earth, but there is ſome imperfect voyce calling on thee to glorifie that great and wonderful Creator, who made all theſe things: But then</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There are the Judgements and Chaſtiſements of God upon men <note place="margin">The Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.</note> for ſin; theſe have a louder and more diſtinct voyce: Thus the Prophet, <hi>Hear ye the Rod,</hi> Micah 6. 9. <hi>The Rod ſpeaketh:</hi> There are no judgements, either pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique or perſonal, but by them God calls aloud to thee to leave thy ſins: Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry blow-thou haſt, every ſtroke thou feeleſt, ſay, Now God ſpeaketh, Oh let me hearken and hear what God would have me do. Thoſe <hi>Pſalms</hi> that have this Inſcription, <hi>Maſchil,</hi> or <hi>To give Inſtruction,</hi> do for the moſt part contain the Chaſtiſements and Afflictions of God for ſin: And ſo thou mayeſt ſay of every affliction, This is an affliction to give inſtruction; of every loſs, This is a loſs to give inſtruction. Take heed then of that deaf ear, that when God ſmiteth thee once, twice, yea, many times, yet thou heareſt nothing at all; as deaf men do not hear the moſt terrible thundrings that are.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, There is a voyce that calls aloud, and that is the conſcience God hath planted in thee; for that is Gods lamp put into thy breaſt: All the bitings <note place="margin">The voyce of Conſcience.</note> and accuſings, and ſmitings that gives thee for thy ſins, its no leſs then God calling thee by that; Indeed this is a natural call, and ſo reducible to Gods external calling, yet it is more peremptory, more quick and lively then either the Creatures or Afflictions are: Hearken then to the calls, to the voyce that ſpeaks in thy boſom; How often doth that ſay, O vile and beaſtly ſinner, when wilt thou leave theſe luſts? when wilt thou depart from theſe evil ways? Is it not high time that thou wert changed from theſe noiſom courſes. Take heed of putting out this light, do not ſtop the mouth of it, for it will one day cry louder,
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:30767:320"/>
That will be the gnawing worm, which will never dye. Thus much for the firſt part.</p>
                  <p>We come to the Second, wherein the marrow and life of this <hi>Holy calling</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">II. As Internal.</note> doth conſiſt; and that is in internal works upon the ſoul, which are carefully to be obſerved; that ſo every man may conſider, whether he be in the number of thoſe called ones or no, <hi>that ſhall alſo be glorified;</hi> for its no mercy, yea an ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of miſery, to be called here outwardly, and to enjoy the priviledges of grace, and hereafter to be damned finally.</p>
                  <p>Now the firſt particular, wherein this inward calling conſiſts, <hi>Is to open the ear of</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1. It conſiſts:</note> 
                     <hi>man, to give him a ſpiritual hearing, ſo that he doth readily cloſe with the call:</hi> Every man naturally hath a deaf ear to Gods call: Though he hath a natural ear to hear the ſound of the words, yet he hath not a ſpiritual ear; whence is that phraſe ſo often, <hi>He that hath ears to hear, let him hear:</hi> So that God in effectual calling of his people to him, doth not onely cauſe a ſound of words, but changeth the ear, ſo that it heareth ſpiritually: This is called <hi>An awakened ear,</hi> or <hi>A revealed ear,</hi> Iſa. 50. 4. Men naturally have their ears ſtopt and filled with earthly and mucky luſts: So that as deaf men cannot hear the moſt terrible noiſe of thundrings; ſo neither do ſuch the dreadful voyce of God threatning in his word: So that in this powerful calling, God ſaith <hi>Ephaphtha,</hi> to every deaf man, <hi>Be thou opened.</hi> Conſider then with thy ſelf, if thou art thus called, God hath given thee a quick ready ear; no ſooner doth God ſpeak, but thou ſayeſt, <hi>Lo here I am, O Lord, to do thy will;</hi> and although luſts, and the cares of the world make a noiſe, yet thou heareſt Gods voyce above alll: You may hear with affection, with delight and underſtanding, and yet not have this graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ear.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>This effectual calling is opening the heart chiefly, ſo that it gives up it ſelf in obedience unto God:</hi> Where there is this calling after Gods purpoſe, there <note place="margin">2.</note> the heart is ſo mollified and ſoftned, that the firſt thing it pitcheth upon, is with <hi>Paul,</hi> to ſay, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> This is ſo natural a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent from ſpiritual hearing, that <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, hearing, is often put for obedience in the Scripture: Thus, as <hi>Paul, I was not diſobedient to the heavenly viſion,</hi> Acts 26. 19. ſo is every man when inwardly called, he doth no longer reſiſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe the gracious offers of God, he ſtands it out no more; yea it grieveth and troubleth him at the very heart, that he hath withſtood the call of God ſo often; it might now be too late, God might juſtly refuſe to hear him, as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to hear God. Now this obedience unto God calling, hath theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Its a ready obedience:</hi> When once this powerful call manifeſts it ſelf, there is no more diſputing, there is no more arguings; Its God that calls, I muſt obey: Indeed, the outward offer of grace is too often rejected, and many Antecedaneous motions to converſions are ſuffocated; but when God giveth this laſt call, then the dead come out of the grave and live; then ſaith <hi>Paul, Imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately I conſulted not with fleſh and blood,</hi> Gal. 1. As Chriſt called from heaven to <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo <hi>Paul</hi> had fleſh, and blood on earth calling him the clean contrary way. Carnal conſultations, they invited to ſafety, eaſe, pleaſure; but the holy calling of God, to ſelf-denial, zeal, and ſuffering for Gods ſake, prevailed: Behold then the mighty power of God, that as ſoon as his word is out of his mouth, to ſuch a ſoul imbracing and deſiring its old luſts, immediately he throweth all away, though pleaſures, profits, carnal friends, all hang upon him to be the ſame he was once: Thus <hi>Matthew</hi> the Publican, as ſoon as Chriſt called him, <hi>Come and follow me,</hi> immediately he leaveth his profit and imployment, going after Chriſt: So that this calling hath a ſpeedy obedience.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>It hath a chearful and willing obedience:</hi> They follow this call with delight, yea they bleſs and greatly praiſe God, that hath made them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of this <hi>Heavenly calling,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 1. Hence it is that
<pb n="590" facs="tcp:30767:321"/>
Calling in the Text is reckoned among thoſe other ineſtimable benefits of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, Juſtification, and Glorification. How gladly did <hi>Zacheus</hi> receive Chriſt, when Chriſt called to him! and the Apoſtles whom Chriſt called, how willingly did they part with all to accompany him! So then, if thou art thus effectually called, there is a willingneſs, a delight, and exceeding great joy put into thy ſoul: Oh thou bleſſeſt God that ever he took notice of thee, thou art even raviſhed with the admiration of Gods love and kindeneſs to thee, its no grief or trouble of heart to leave thy former luſts; yea, they are a burthen, a ſhame now to thee. As if a poor Peaſants daughter ſhould be called to marry a great King; how doth this tranſcendently affect her? it doth not trouble her to leave her old Cottage, to put off her old rags, to eat no more of her courſe food, but rather rejoyceth in the change that is made: Thus it is here, when God gives thee this call, then thou abhorreſt the prophane, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and ungodly life that thou didſt once live: then thou ſayeſt, I have found Manna for thoſe husks I fed upon; I have found gold for that noiſom dung I had before.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Its an univerſal obedience:</hi> This effectual calling hath divers duties to which a man is called, and it refuſeth none. When God called <hi>Abraham</hi> out of his own Countrey, from his kindred, and from the Idolatry he lived in; What an illimited obedience did <hi>Abraham</hi> demonſtrate? <hi>He went,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>not knowing whither he did go,</hi> Heb. 11. 8. God called him out of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and did not tell him whither he ſhould go, nor what he ſhould do, yet <hi>Abrahams</hi> obedience is ready to all this: This then cuts off the hopes of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, who run haſtily after Gods command in ſome particulars, and in ſome duties, where ſelf-advantage, ſelf-intereſt or applauſe may ſhew it ſelf; but univerſally to obey in every command, in every call, that they cannot yield unto.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Its a pure obedience:</hi> This calling hath a pure obedience, that is, obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience for obedience ſake, becauſe of the Authority and Soveraignty of God who commands; as you ſee it was in <hi>Abraham,</hi> in <hi>Paul,</hi> in <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: There was no reaſon in the world of their obedience, but meerly becauſe God called them: And then is obedience acceptable, when it is becauſe God requireth it. But</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>This effectual calling gives a ſpiritual underſtanding and abilities, to know how to perform the duties and parts of this calling:</hi> Hence they are ſaid to be <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>made light in the Lord,</hi> Iſa. 4. God never called any man to a particular calling, either in Church or State, but he alſo gave him abilities and fitneſs for it; as <hi>Moſes, Aaron, Joſhua,</hi> yea <hi>Saul</hi> had Kingly, though not gracious abilities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on him: Now God will much more do thus in a general and more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble calling. Oh then conſider, how art thou qualified with abilities to be a Chriſtian, to be a Believer? God hath called thee out of darkneſs, out of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, to be a Saint, to walk as a member of Chriſt; now, haſt thou abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities for this calling? Do you not deride thoſe that are in any calling, and have no abilities for it? do you not think ſuch men unworthy of their place? No leſs art thou of this calling, who knoweſt not how to believe, to pray, to live, to worſhip God as thy calling doth require.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>This effectual calling denoteth a ſeparation, or ſetting of a man apart unto that which he is called:</hi> So that he muſt not live as he hath done, but he <note place="margin">4.</note> muſt ſolely buſie himſelf in that to which he is called: Thus the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his calling to be an Apoſtle, he ſaith, <hi>He was ſet apart:</hi> And in all worldly callings, you ſee men are ſet apart betimes unto it, and that they wholly give themſelves to what their calling is; and its a ſure forerunner of poverty, to be negligent herein: And thus it is in our ſpiritual calling, God hath ſet apart the godly man for himſelf, he calls him out of the world, and from all his former luſts, to live wholly unto him: Oh how little do men conſider, that
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:30767:321"/>
they are ſeparated and ſet apart by their calling, unto God onely, not to live to ſin or the world any more: Thus you have heard wherein the nature of this ſpiritual effectual calling doth conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>The firſt uſe is of Inſtruction, That moſt men in the Church of God have but an <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> outward calling meerly, they have no inward at all; for where is the opened ear, the opened heart? where is the ready, ſpeedy and pure univerſal obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all that God calls upon us to do? where is the ſpiritual abilities for all the parts of our Chriſtian calling? where are men ſeparated and set apart from their luſts to holineſs onely? and yet no man is inwardly called, till he have all theſe: Oh then let thy ſoul make bitter lamentations in ſecret, let it pour out tears abundantly, ſaying, O Lord, this heavenly calling hath been no further then hear yet, it hath not gone to the heart; How often haſt thou called upon me to leave theſe ſins, to love thoſe duties, and yet I have wilfully been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient. Oh it is this inward effectual calling, that will onely make thee hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; yet from this very day, from this very ſermon that calleth you at this time, how many will go to their former luſts and wickedneſs? what may not God and his Miniſters ſay, <hi>We are weary with calling any more,</hi> as God told <hi>Ezekiel, Ezek.</hi> 3. 6. If he did ſend him to a people of a ſtrange ſpeech, and a ſtrange lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, ſurely they would hear, but the Iſraelites would not: So if God ſhould ſend us to call the Heathens and Pagans, ſurely they would regard the call, they would entertain it; but you have lived long under this mercy, and ſo neglect it: <hi>Non reſpondere pro convitio eſt,</hi> What diſhonor is it then to God, not to anſwer him, calling ſo many years together.</p>

                  <p>THe next thing conſiderable, that will further explain the nature of this Calling, is the <hi>Terminus a quo,</hi> and <hi>Adquem:</hi> And this is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. <note place="margin">Gods people are called: 1. From blinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into light.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, <hi>Gods calling is from a ſtate of blindeneſs and ignorance, into marvellous and wonderful light:</hi> As if a man in a dark dungeon, where there was not the leaſt beam of light, ſhould be called out of that to the glorious Sun: <hi>Ye were once darkneſs, but now are ye light,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5. 8. yea, its called <hi>Marvellous light,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 9. for the wonderful glory and excellency of it: A man without this holy calling, is like hell it ſelf, a place of utter dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Now the call of God brings a twofold light with it, as you heard; one
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:30767:322"/>
external, inlightning all without us; and the other internal, inlightning the minde and ſoul of a man.</p>
                  <p>In darkneſs there is, firſt, <hi>Danger of ſtumbling and fall;</hi> a man knoweth not where he goeth: Thus, while not effectually called, men are ready to fall into hell every ſtep they take; they ſee not the hell that is open to devour them, they do they know not what. And</p>
                  <p>Secondly, In darkneſs <hi>There is great uncomfortableneſs:</hi> The Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth miſery, and gloomy calamities, under the name of <hi>Darkneſs;</hi> and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the life of every unconverted man, is a very uncomfortable life; for though he may have carnal, tranſient pleaſures, like the blaze of thorns, yet he hath no induring joy: The very name of death and a day of judgement, is like <hi>Belſhazzars</hi> Hand-writing on the wall to him, it puts him into trembling and quaking: But this effectual calling of God, hath the contrary to theſe, its directive to a mans ſteps; he knoweth how to live, how to dye; he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth how to abound, how to want: The word of God being his Counſellor, giveth him wiſe, ſafe, and holy counſel; and hereupon he is never confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he is never fallen into the pit, unleſs when he forſakes this light: And then for the ſecond effect of comfort, they are called <hi>To rejoyce, and again to rejoyce,</hi> Phil. 3. 1. they are called <hi>To peace with God,</hi> Phil 4. 4. to ſerenity in their own conſciences, like the upper Religion that is not diſturbed by any Meteors; inſomuch, that it is both a ſin, and a great diſhonor unto our holy calling, for a godly man to live in diſcouragements and dejections: Its as if there were not that comfort, that happineſs, that joy in poſſeſſing of God, as the Scripture informs us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>We are called from a way of prophaneneſs and ungodlineſs, to live</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. From ungodly to holy lives.</note> 
                     <hi>pure and holy lives:</hi> Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>God hath not called us to uncleanneſs, but unto holineſs,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 4. 7. By <hi>Uncleanneſs,</hi> he means any groſs ſins; inſomuch, that none can conclude he is partaker of this Divine Calling, that ſtill wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the filthy luſts of ſin. Oh then what terror ſhould this ſtrike into every prophane man! If I am thus ungodly, I am not effectually called; if not cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, I cannot be juſtified, I cannot be glorified: How then dare I live as I do? hath God called me to live like a beaſt? is it not ſaid, That we are Saints by calling, not wicked and ungodly by calling? Oh ſhame and confound thy ſoul; ſaying, Where hath God called thee to lye, to ſwear, to be proud, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous? it cannot be lamented enough, to ſee how Chriſtians forget the nature of their Holy Calling: Faſten and fix this meditation upon your hearts; how doth this wickedneſs and diſſoluteneſs of mine, conſiſt with my calling? The Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>That they would walk worthy of their vocation,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 1. do actions beſeeming ſuch an holy, heavenly priviledge; therefore thou ſhouldſt always reflect on thy ſelf, ſaying, How doth this agree with my calling? how doth this become my calling? A man grown up to years, will not ſtill uſe his childiſh tricks, he ſaith, it becomes not his gravity; how much rather mayeſt thou ſay, Such follies, luſts, do not become my Chriſtianity? This is to make my ſelf a monſter, and ſpiritually deformed.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Gods call is from all our former ways of idolatry, ſuperſtition, or falſe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. From falſe worſhip to true.</note> 
                     <hi>worſhip, to the pure and commanded worſhip of God:</hi> All men by nature are ſaid <hi>To walk according to the courſe of this world,</hi> Epheſ. 2. 2. but the godly are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from ſerving their dumb Idols: Thus <hi>Abraham,</hi> God calls him from his own Land, a place of idolatry, to ſerve him. Gods people are called <hi>To come out of Egypt and Babylon, that they might worſhip him according to his own way:</hi> The Churches name is <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> A company called together to ſerve and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God; now who ſhall preſcribe that worſhip, but God himſelf? not the ſervants, but the maſter of the houſe, muſt ſet down the orders to be kept therein; ſo that the pure and ſpiritual worſhipping of God, is one main end of our calling; for God would have a ſelect company out of the world, who
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:30767:322"/>
ſhould own him, give up themſelves to him, and glorifie him, which is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly done by a ſincere, pure worſhipping of him: Its ſtrange therefore that people ſhould be no more inquiſitive about Gods pure worſhip, wherein it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts; not to dote upon, or affect cuſtoms and traditions of worſhip, but to look for the inſtitution and command of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Its a call out of the world, and all things therein, to the enjoyment</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. Out of the world, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy God.</note> 
                     <hi>of God, and applying our ſelves onely to him:</hi> And herein lyeth the excellency of this call. All the world lyeth in wickedneſs, their principles, actions and ends are all wicked; now God calls us out of this <hi>Sodom,</hi> out of this <hi>Egyptian</hi> dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to enjoy him. Hence pure Religion is ſaid to be, <hi>In keeping a man unſpotted from the world,</hi> James 1. 27. that expreſſion denotes, That the world, and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things are like pitch, there is a readineſs to defile, to pollute; and a godly man labors to keep his garments clean: So the Apoſtle exhorts, <hi>That we ſhould not be conformed to the faſhion of the world, but transformed through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing of the minde, that we may know what is the good and acceptable will of God,</hi> Rom. 12 2. And thus the world and the Church are two diſtinct, oppoſite things; its therefore defined to be <hi>Coetus evocatorum,</hi> A company called out of the world: Though we be men made of the earth, yet our Chriſtian being is by a Divine call and power: As precious ſtones, though their materials are of the earth, yet the precious nature they have, is onely from the heavens; as the clouds, though they be vapors ariſing from the earth, yet they fly up to heaven, and follow the motions thereof: So it is here, The people of God, though conſiſting of fleſh and blood, and living an animal life, as others, yet they have a ſpiritual life; inſomuch, that though they live in the world, yet they are not of the world: So that our calling is not onely from groſs foul ſins, but alſo from immoderate and inordinate affections, even to lawful things; called therefore <hi>An heavenly calling,</hi> becauſe its from heaven, and lifteth up to heaven. Hence the godly have <hi>their converſation in heaven,</hi> Phil. 3. 20. heaven, and not the world, is that Corporation and City they are of; they live by the Laws of heaven, not the world; their comforts are heavenly comforts, not earthly; their priviledges are heavenly priviledges, not worldly. Art thou effectually called? herein it will diſcover it ſelf, if thy heart and affections be ſet on heavenly things, where God and Chriſt are, who are the beloved of thy ſoul: Its not enough to caſt off all the noiſom rags and menſtrous cloathes of impiety, but to throw away all burthens, and any heavy weight that may hinder thee in thy race to heaven: The Apoſtle ſuppoſeth this, when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes us ſuch a ſpare dyet upon theſe things: <hi>They that marry, muſt be as if they married not,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. ſo they that buy, and have the world: God hath called you to look upwards; and as man cannot at the ſame time look with one eye up to heaven, and another towards the earth; ſo neither can a man have his heart towards God, and alſo towards the world: Live not then, as if thy ſoul were made of duſt, as well as thy body, as if thou wert a worm in this ſenſe; for feeding on the earth, as well as for contemptibleneſs: The Devil feeding on the duſt of the earth, is the Devil poſſeſſing earthly men. Conſider, that God hath called you to injoy himſelf, to be made one with Chriſt, and to have communion and fellowſhip with him: Oh how ſhould this ſunne put out the ſtars; this Manna, that Garlike.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>This calling is from a ſtate of quietneſs and ſecurity in the world, to a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5. From a ſtate of quietneſs, to a ſtate of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction.</note> 
                     <hi>ſtate of trouble and affliction:</hi> The very calling of a Chriſtian, is accompanied with many oppoſitions and ſufferings, which formerly he was not uſed unto; and herein our Saviour dealt very faithfully, when he invited men to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, He bid them prepare for the croſs, for all evil-intreating in the world: <hi>The world loves his own,</hi> but it will hate thoſe that are Chriſts; and again, <hi>He that will be his diſciple, muſt take up his croſs, and follow him;</hi> this Chriſt admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſheth aforehand: That as the Devil inticeth by the preſent pleaſures, but
<pb n="594" facs="tcp:30767:323"/>
concealeth the future miſeries; Chriſt doth take a contrary way, he revealeth the future glory and happineſs, but doth alſo inſtruct them concerning the preſent afflictions and troubles they ſhall have in this world; ſo then, ſad and grievous exerciſes they muſt look for: The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks excellently to this purpoſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. where laying down admirable directions about ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that it muſt not be for any fault or imprudence in our ſelves, but meerly out of conſcience to God, ſo that we ſuffer wrongfully in all we ſuffer; he tells them, <hi>This is acceptable unto God; And hereunto we are called;</hi> obſerve that, to unjuſt and wrongful ſufferings he is called: The Scripture uſeth an equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent phraſe, <hi>Hereunto you were appointed;</hi> yea, God from all eternity did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate us to be conformable unto Chriſt in his ſufferings; therefore as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith, Let every one that ſets out againſt the world and the Devil in Chriſts name, that will take up his profeſſion, let him firſt conſider, what he can do; Can he leave all, forſake all, deny all, and part with every dearly beloved ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for Chriſts ſake? then he may take much comfort: The Hypocrite, the temporary Believer; he proveth an unfaithful Apoſtate, becauſe of this, he did not forecaſt what he ſhould do, when the ſcorching heat of the Sun ſhould ariſe; and this made our Saviour even refuſe the offer, that ſome tendred to be Diſciples, following of him, becauſe he knew what unſted faſtneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs was in their heart. Now as this hath ſome diſheartning in it, that while we lived ſlaves to our luſts, all things were quiet, and we lived ſecure lives; but ſince we gave up our ſelves to God, every thing hath riſen up againſt us, we have procured an univerſal <hi>odium:</hi> I ſay, though this may diſcourage, yet in that the Scripture ſaith, we are called to it, it denoteth, That theſe things come by the gracious providence of a merciful father; and that where he calls, he gives alſo ſtrength and proportionable abilities: ſo that the very expreſſion, <hi>To be called to trouble in this world,</hi> hath much ſweetneſs. and hopeful incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in it. And</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>This holy calling is from a ſtate of danger and miſery, to a ſtate of bleſſedneſs</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6. From an eſtate of miſery, to a ſtate of bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs.</note> 
                     <hi>and happines:</hi> God doth not only call us out of the ſinfulnes of the world, but alſo all that wrath and vengeance which is prepared for men of the world. As <hi>Lot,</hi> you heard, was called out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> or as <hi>Noah</hi> was called into the Ark, when the waves of water did overwhelm others: Thus God he calls his people from that fire and brimſtone, and from that deluge of fury, which is to fal upon others: ſo ſome make this expreſſion of calling to be a metaphor or alluſion, to one that calleth such a man to come out of an houſe, when the main pillars are ready to break in pieces. Oh then, never think much to be called out of this <hi>Egypt,</hi> this <hi>Babylon;</hi> for its Gods mercy to thee, when thou ſhalt ſee the beams fall upon others, the fire and brimſtone burn others, and thou eſcape; this muſt needs fill thee with much aſtoniſhment and joy: Stand not then conſulting, How ſhall I part with theſe pleaſures, theſe profits? How ſhall I depart from the cuſtom of evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? for its a mercy to be ſnatched from them: Oh ſay rather, How can I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure thoſe everlaſting burnings?</p>
                  <p>In the next place, let us conſider, what Epithets or Properties the Scripture gives this calling. And <note place="margin">What Epithets or Properties the Scripture gives this cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Its a calling according to his purpoſe, and his good pleaſure, as here in this Chapter:</hi> And this denoteth, That God doth not foreſee any merit, or any motive in us, but its meerly of his pleaſure; therefore its in the paſſive ſenſe, we are called, <hi>viz. By God;</hi> its never ſaid, We call our ſelves; and withal, it being a calling according to Gods purpoſe, it ſuppoſeth the ſure and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful efficacy of it: God cannot be diſappointed in his purpoſe, <hi>The counſel of the Lord will ſtand;</hi> ſo that all this debaſeth man, makes him an impotent and undone man to all eternity, if God help not: Oh then let this take thee up, as it were, into the third heavens, let it mightily rejoyce thy heart, who
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:30767:323"/>
hath had this compaſſion and pity on thee: Alas! God from all eternity had a purpoſe to be thus gracious unto thee; when thou hadſt no being at all, long before the foundations of the world were laid, God had thoughts of love and kindeneſs to thee, when thou couldſt not deſire or beg for ſuch a mercy: Its no wonder that <hi>Paul</hi> doth often run out in large expreſſions concerning Gods Love, his Predeſtination from all eternity, when he hath occaſion to praiſe God for the calling and converſion of any in time; for this is to trace the ſtream, till we finde the well-head: This is, as it was with <hi>Ezekiels</hi> waters, to go from wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that riſe up to the ankle, at laſt to that which will cover the head: What can then be able to diſcourage the heart of a godly man? what can diſquiet? Here is a <hi>Catholicon</hi> for all diſeaſes: Art thou afflicted? God hath called thee from all eternity? Art thou deſpiſed by men? God eſteemed of thee from the beginning of the world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Its an holy calling<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> This is a frequent adjective; ſo that there is nothing in this calling, but what comes from an holy God: The matter of it <note place="margin">2.</note> is holy, and the end altogether holy; inſomuch, that all prophane, ungodly men ſhould bluſh to own this profeſſion: Thou art called to be a Saint, to be in the world, as a bright ſtar in a dark night; But, is to be proud, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, prophane, malicious? is this to be a Saint? Oh how ſhould our bowels rowl within us, to ſee how God is diſhonored, his Laws are broken, and that by thoſe, who glory in the call of a Chriſtian! Oh let not ſuch groſs ſins be any more practiſed or named among you! As in the Temple, every veſſel was holy, ſo every part of thy ſoul and body ſhall be holy; an holy minde, holy thoughts, holy affections, holy eyes an holy tongue, an holy body: Thy cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling being thus an holy calling, all within thee, and all that floweth from thee, ſhould alſo be holy.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Its an heavenly calling:</hi> Whether you do regard the efficient cauſe, <note place="margin">3.</note> God from heaven calls to theſe dry bones to live; if the matter of it, it is to be heavenly in our converſations; to go through this world as pilgrims, to be as the fowls of the heaven, which though they pitch upon the ground for their food, yet they preſently fly up to heaven: The priviledges are heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, pardon of ſin, aſſurance of Gods favor, increaſe in grace, communion with God, and enjoying of God in heaven for ever. We ſee how <hi>David</hi> prized being ſon in Law to a King: There are callings to great outward glory in this world; but God vouchſafeth a greater mercy to thoſe who have this heavenly calling.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Its an high calling,</hi> Phil. 3. 14. The Apoſtle there compareth himſelf <note place="margin">4.</note> in the progreſs of Chriſtianity, to one ſtriving and running in a race; there ſhould be no dulneſs no weariſomneſs in this way: now as in thoſe race, they who judged ſate in an high place, and by an Herald called out every man to run; ſo he ſaith, God from heaven calls out every man to make haſte in this way of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; ſo that thou art to hear him from heaven, calling thee to preſs forward, to think nothing is yet done, as long as ſo much remaineth behinde; and if they were ſo earneſt for a corruptible crown, how much rather ſhould we for an incorruptible?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Its a calling diſpenſod in a very contrary way to humane expectation;</hi> which makes that Doctrine of <hi>Congrua vocatio</hi> to fall to the ground: <hi>You ſee</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note>

                  <p>I Shall conclude this Text with an inſtance of ſome choice properties or effects that do accompany this calling. For ſeeing to ſuch only belong Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Juſtification and Glorification, Our life and eternal happineſs lieth in this, to he found in the number of theſe called ones. Our Saviour told the Diſciples, <hi>That they ſhould not rejoyce in that they wrought miracles, that the devils were ſubject to them, but rather that their names were written in the book of life, Luk.</hi> 10. 20. Much leſſe then may men rejoyce in being rich, honoured and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this world, if they be not alſo called to grace and glory. The former are good things of this life only, the later of the life to come.</p>

                     <hi>then examine thy ſelf in thy real anſwer and obedience to it;</hi> For to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led according to Gods purpoſe, is to have the event accompanying it. God no ſooner cals but they hear. What God bids them do they do, what God bids them forſake they forſake. Oh but to how many do the Prophets ſtretch out their arms in vain! To what deaf men do we call? In what a <hi>Babel</hi> and confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on hath ſinne caſt men, they are commanded to live holily, but oh the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe! God cals them to purity, but oh the uncleanneſs! Thus in ſtead of anſwering, there is the contrary diſobedience, God looks for grapes, and behold wilde grapes.

                     </gap>lled, thou wouldſt cry out, Speak Lord, for thy ſervant heareth; when God gave <hi>Abraham</hi> a call and command to ſacr fice his only Sonne, he riſeth early in the morning, and can lay his kinfe to the very throat of his only childe; Even thus when God commands thee to mortifie ſuch a ſinne, to crucifie ſuch a luſt, ſpare it not, kill it, elſe it will kill thee, it will damn thee; now the effectually called perſon, he gets up betimes, he layeth his knife to the throat of his deareſt luſts, and now he hates this <hi>Tamar</hi> more then ever he loved her: Oh, he crieth out, I muſt either part with God or ſinne, I muſt either leave Chriſt or this luſt, I cannot keep them both together, and then with much zeal and deteſtation, he caſts away his beloved tranſgreſſions, God then careth not for thy formalities, thy complements, thy duties, but is thy obedience ready? God cals thee to love him, to hate ſinne; Is this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand obeyed? <hi>Obedience is better then Sacrifice:</hi> Didſt thou obey God in giving over thy ſwearing, thy drunkenneſs, thy luſts; This would be more acceptable then ten thouſand Sacrifices, or outward duties of Religion. Even the very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate creatures have obeyed when called upon, as when the Prophet cried, <hi>O Altar, Altar, hear the word of the Lord,</hi> and it rent in pieces; but thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueſt obſtinate.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The effectually called, they do carefully obſerve and watch againſt all thoſe contrary cals, that would turn them out of the way:</hi> For you muſt know as <note place="margin">2.</note> God hath his voice calling; ſo ſin and the devil they have their ſweet Syrenian Songs; They have their cals alſo, one cals one way, the other a contrary way. <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> tels us of wiſdom, that is, <hi>Godlineſſe uttering her voice in the ſtreets, crying aloud,</hi> Pro. 1. 7. <hi>To the ſimple and unwiſe that they get underſtanding:</hi> and then again he tels us of the whoriſh woman, as diligent to call in the ſimple man that paſſeth by, to defile himſelf. Our Saviour bids us <hi>Be wiſe as Serpents,</hi> Mat. 11. 16. Now as he ſtoppeth his ear that he may not hear the charmers, though char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming never ſo wiſely, becauſe it's for his deſtruction; ſo much rather ought we to cloſe up the ear againſt all thoſe ſweet allurements of ſinne, and temptations thereunto: <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> his companions were all turned into beaſts, (as they feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) becauſe they would drink of thoſe inticing cups, and hearken to the Syrenian Songs. And therefore men are degenerated into all luſts and beaſtlineſſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they hearken to ſenſe, to luſts, they attend to their call and cry. As <hi>Eve</hi> giving ear to the Serpent, and not refuſing him at firſt, was immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; now then the truly called ones, they ſtop the ear againſt the world, againſt carnal wiſdom, and hearken only what God ſaith, what the Scripture ſaith. It is many times the profeſſion of a Chriſtian; Oh if I could but know when God cals to me! If I could but underſtand his will what he would have me to do, then I would run after him; now there is no ſuch way to finde out God calling of thee, as to bid all carnal reaſonings, all fleſhly conſultations ſtand aloof off. If a man would ſee the true repreſentation of his face in a glaſſe; he muſt wipe off all the duſt and filth, and ſo if thou wouldſt diſcern Gods cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of thee from all other falſe cals, be ſure that earthly conſiderations be not laid in the ſcale: Thus <hi>Paul</hi> refuſed that conſulration which fleſh and bloud profered him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16. and ſo Chriſt bid <hi>Peter, Depart for he was a Satan to him, Mat,</hi> 8. 33. an adverſary to him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>He that is effectually called, is carefull to walk in a worthy and beſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>manner of it. I beſeech you,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, that you walk worthy of your calling, Epheſ.</hi> 4. 1. Every man in any condition or eſtate, is to look to the <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> 
                     <hi>quod decet,</hi> what is fitting and becoming him. Thoſe actions are beſeeming a childe which are not an old man; men of better breeding have a ſutable deportment: And thus it is in Chriſtianity, Thy holy and heavenly calling ſhould raiſe up thy ſpirits, ennoble thy converſation. As <hi>Nehemiah</hi> argued from the office and truſt that was committed to him, <hi>Shall ſuch a man as I flee?</hi> Thou ſhouldſt then
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:30767:325"/>
conſider, Shall ſuch an one as I tumble and wallow in the mire? Shall I that have ſuch an holy and heavenly calling, live like a beaſt? I here is nothing ſhould ſo confound and a ſhame a man for all ſinful and ungodly wayes, as that they are not ſutable unto, nor worthy of his calling. <hi>Michal</hi> did in a ſinful way deſpiſe <hi>David</hi> in her heart, when ſhe ſaw him dancing before the Ark, <hi>Thou haſt made thy ſelf</hi> (ſaith ſhe, 2 <hi>Sam. 6.) like one of the vile fellows this day;</hi> like one of the baſe ones of the world. She did this maliciouſly; but thou mayeſt truly ſay to thy ſoul, when overcome with unruly paſſions, inordinate affections; Thou haſt made thy ſelf like the vileſt of men to day. Do then things that are beſeeming your calling, that are a grace to it, that may bring an honor and a glory to it in the eyes of the world. Shall the Sunne ſend forth no more light then the dung-hill? Shall a Roſe ſmell no ſweeter then a noiſome weed? Dead Flies are not fit to fall in a box of ointment. As <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaid of his two ſons, when they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſuch outragious wickedneſſe on the <hi>Sichemites, You have made me to ſtink before the inhabitants of the Land.</hi> Thus alſo mayeſt thou ſay to all unmortified affections, uncrucified luſts, You have made me to ſtink, to be loathſome and abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable before God. Therefore above all things look to this, that your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation be as becometh this heavenly calling, you may not live as you liſt, walk as you pleaſe, make your luſts and your pleaſures a rule to walk by; but conſider what you are called to.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>He that is effectually called, doth alwayes deſire to go after Gods calling of him:</hi> For as in Philoſophy, we are nouriſhed by thoſe things we at firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt <note place="margin">4.</note> of, Thus it is here. By what means at firſt we come to be holy, to be godly, <hi>viz</hi> by Gods calling of us, we did not hearken to other cals. So it is ſtill in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. God ſtill calleth us by his Word to every duty, to avoid every ſin, and herein we follow God. Oh it is admirable wiſdom in all things to conſider what call we have! Thoſe ſervants are blamed for their raſhneſs, and not commended for their forwardnes, who come or go before they are called, before they have their errand. <hi>Pſ. 25. 9. The upright he will teach and guide in his way,</hi> Pſ. 32. 8. And ſo <hi>David, Thou wilt guide me with thy eye:</hi> As a father by his eye doth ſignifie what he would have his ſonne to do; ſo it is here, God doth by his Word either particularly or generally give him a call to every action or condition. And he that was at firſt wrought upon by Gods calling, doth ſtill look after this Starre to guide him. He that undertaketh any thing, doth any thing without Gods calling, doth as the devil tempted our Saviour, <hi>Set himſelf upon a pinacle, and throw himſelf headlong.</hi> For this is the onely ſupport and encouragement under any aſſaults, that all is done in obedience to Gods calling us. Thus <hi>Moſes, Iſaiah, David, Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> with many others, could never have conflicted with all the difficulties they did, had not this calling of God ſupported them; ſo then as at the firſt our ſpiritual life came by a divine calling, thus the progreſſe alſo is by Gods calling; we do not iutrude our ſelves, we go not before we have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, we hearken to what God will ſay; and hence it is that the devil doth ſo induſtriouſly imitate the voice of God; Even as the beaſt <hi>Hyena</hi> imitates the voice of the Shepherd to deſtroy the ſheep; he pretends revelations from God, he brings forcible interpretations of Scripture; ſo great a matter is it eſpecially in doubtful things, and where the Scripture hath onely general rules, and not particular determinations, to diſtinguiſh the voice of God from the voice of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, or our own deſires. How many are apt to take the dictates and deſires of their own ſpirits for the voice of God! As the old Prophet counterfeited a voice and call of God contrary to what the other Prophet had received, and thereby ſeduced him: It is then a ſure and good ſign of a called perſon, in all matters, ſpecially of great concernment, to regard Gods calling, whether it be to do or to ſuffer: whereas wicked men they never attend to Gods directing of them, Gods guiding of them, never pray about this, or ſtudy and meditate about this, but as their luſts and profits carry them, ſo they run headlong.</p>

                     <pb n="599" facs="tcp:30767:325"/>
Fifthly, <hi>He that is effectually called is greatly thankefull even to aſtoniſhment</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>and raviſhment, for this high mercy vouchſafed to him.</hi> The grace of the Goſpel whereſoever it doth powerfully work, doth ſo ſoften and melt the heart, that praiſe and thankfulneſs is the great duty he ſtudies; Oh how ſhall I be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful! and the Lord inlarge my heart to praiſe him! What am I that God ſhould call me! Oh, Why is my Soul ſo barren, ſo ſtreightned! Why doe I not runne all over? Why doth not my heart boil within me? Thus a man partaker of this heavenly calling is affected; See the Apoſtles aggravation of Gods mercy here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, 2 <hi>Tim. 1. 9. Who hath called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> his own purpoſe and grace.</hi> The Apoſtle melts himſelf into raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts about this, The God that needed me not, yea the God that was ſo greatly offended, and provoked by me, he out of his free grace cals me from ſinne and danger, from all that eternal wrath I was obnoxious unto; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Bleſſe the Lord, O my Soul, and let all within thee bleſſe his holy name.</hi> You may obſerve the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> diſpoſition, when he hath occaſion to ſpeak of Gods converting and calling us out of the former luſts of ſinne he lived in, he is ſo tranſported that he never ſatisfieth himſelf with a thankful remembrance thereof; Wherein men are affected, and what they account extraordinary mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, there they will alwayes be ſpeaking; Their Meditations are ſweet and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning about it. So that it is a ſure ſign thou waſt never yet effectually called, if thy ſoul many times break not out with joy and thankſgiving herein. Shall out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mercies, ſafety, wealth, honours, ſo work upon thee, as we ſee they did on <hi>Haman,</hi> and ſhall it not much more prevail with thee to be called to be Gods friend, and Gods favourite? How ſhould all the afflictions and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements in the world be eaſily ſubdued, when this conſideration prevaileth with thee!</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>He that is thus called according to Gods purpoſe, he is careful not to apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statize or to go back again into that courſe of ſin and wickedneſſe, out of which he was</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>called.</hi> As a man called out of fetters, and a dark dungeon, by all means takes heed that he be not thrown in there again. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were called only bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> not in their affections and heart, when they ſo deſired to make themſelves a Captain, and to return thither again; yea when they loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that admirable Manna, and deſired their former Onyons again: Oh it is a ſign thou waſt never powerfully called! who for a time indeed haſt given over thy beaſtly luſts, wilt commit them no more, but not long after doſt return to the practice of them again; This makes it worſe with thee then if thou hadſt never begun to cleanſe thy ſelf. Our Saviour hath a notable Parable to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, of a man out of whom a devil was caſt, but he <hi>returned again, and brought ſeven worſe with him.</hi> Mat. 12. 45. Oh look to this then you who formerly have given ſome hopes of being called, you heard a voice within you, ſaying, Doe no more ſuch abominable things. You begun to pray, to weep, to be greatly affected; oh the conflicts that your ſouls formerly felt, but now all ſtreams are dried up, you are as barren, as prophane as ever! Know to thy terror and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, thou haſt cauſe to examine whether the mighty power of God hath not yet called thee. <hi>No man that putteth his hand to the plough and looketh back is ſit for the kingdom of Heaven:</hi> Our Saviour did alwayes attend to this, to lay ſuch principles in thoſe that would be his Diſciples, that they might never revolt: Therefore he told them of the worſt afore hand, and daily inſtructed them about the danger of not perſevering: He that is truly called doth ſtand immoveably like a rock, <hi>Like Mount Sion that cannot be removed;</hi> and indeed there is great reaſon for it, Can he be better then he is? Doth not God make up all things to him? Are his former luſts and the pleaſures he took in them equal to God, and the enjoyment of him? Was there not bitterneſs and gall even in the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt honey of any of his ſins? <hi>But at Gods right hand there are rivers of pleaſure for evermore.</hi>
                  </p>

Laſtly, <hi>He that is thus called doth keep up his heat, and comfort himſelf with that hope of eternal life, and glory to which he is called.</hi> Hence <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>He preſſeth forward for the mark of his high calling.</hi> As a man in a race attends not to any <note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note> directions, but fixeth his eye upon the crown that he runneth for. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> did, No earthly or worldly temptations do hinder him; but his heart, his thoughts, his affections are ſet upon that eternal glory: Therefore we are ſaid <hi>to be called to this hope.</hi> A man never hath true hopes till he be thus called. Alas, What be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of wicked mens hopes? they place their hopes in outward greatneſſe, in outward power, in outward glory; now theſe <hi>periſh like the graſſe of the field:</hi> When Death comes, when Judgement comes, then all his hopes periſh: but the righteous hath hope in his death; and it is a lively hope, death and the grave cannot quell it. We ſay, <hi>If it were not for hope the heart would break;</hi> but what hope haſt thou who liveſt in thy ſins, not forſaking of them? Will the world, will thy luſts, thy carnal friends be any longer a comfort to thee? Oh it is much that every wicked man doth not tear himſelf, and roar out with horrour, <hi>I have no hope!</hi> God is offended, Chriſt did not give himſelf for ſuch as I am, living in, and loving of my ſins. Till I come out of this eſtate, there is laid up no hope for me. Go then and conclude with thy ſelf, I have no hope as yet but about worldly things: Oh miſerable man that I am! There is but a ſtep between me and death, between me and hell, and yet I look not out; but when thou art called, then thy hopes will ſurely be eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe of Exhortation.</hi> Are the called of God thus qualified? then what matter <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> of Lamentation is here, to ſee ſo few ſuch among the number of thoſe that are outwardly called? Where is the man of whom we may pronounce all theſe things, that he readily obeys, that he honours this calling. that he deſireth to follow God in all things? Who is the man that doth this? Now the truth is, the tempations of ſin and the world, they call ſo violently, ſo pleaſingly the contrary way, that it is no wonder if ſo few follow God. But to perſwade you to refuſe theſe <hi>Dalilahs</hi> alwaies tempting of you,</p>

The introduction, <hi>For ye ſee your calling;</hi> ſome read it imperative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>See and take notice of your calling;</hi> which way ſoever you take it, it amounts to this, That Gods calling of men from a ſtate of ſin, to grace, is like <hi>Ezekiels</hi> waters, that riſe up higher and higher; we may ſtill take notice of ſome more excellent and admirable aggravations in it: The looking upon the Creation, and conſidering of the Creatures, it may juſtly ſtir up men to glorifie the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and power of God: But this much more; and that which the Apoſtle doth eſpecially take notice of in this Text is, the perſons whom he hath called, and they are deſcribed, firſt, Negatively, then Poſitively. Negatively, <hi>Not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wiſe, not many mighty, not many noble;</hi> where he doth not abſolutely deny, no wiſe, no mighty, no great ones; for examples in Scripture are recorded, of ſome few ſuch, but not many: This is a ſerious conſideration, to ſhame and confound all fleſh; Who do not look upon theſe things, as making men happy and glorious? but God overlooketh them all. Now to fix us the more upon this conſideration, he illuſtrates it on the contrary, <hi>God hath choſen fooliſh and weak, and baſe things in the world:</hi> The Apoſtle in this Argument, makes cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and chooſing all one, becauſe they neceſſarily agree, as the cauſe and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect together, Election and efficacious calling follow one another. Laſtly, the Apoſtle inſtructs us about the end of Gods diſpenſation in all theſe things; and that is twofold; 1. <hi>To confound the wiſe, and to bring to nought the mighty things that are.</hi> 2. Which is a conſequent of the former, <hi>That no fleſh ſhould glory in his preſence;</hi> that none may ſay, It was his power, wiſdom, or any humane

excellency that did thus advance him, but Gods grace onely. Let us firſt conſider the introduction, <hi>You ſee,</hi> or, <hi>See your calling:</hi> And obſerve,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That Gods calling of us, is worthy of many ſerious and fixed meditations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Its like Tapeſtry folded up, which when opened, makes a glorious ſhew. If <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> had her ſpirit faint within her, with admiration of <hi>Solomons</hi> wiſdom, how much rather may we, in beholding of the wiſdom and goodneſs of God herein? Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>The kingdom of heaven comes not by obſervation,</hi> Luke. 17. 10. that is, the excellent works of grace, which are the Kingdom of Heaven; and the Goſpel, which is the inſtrument of theſe; they come not as <note place="margin">In reſpect of the inviſibility of it.</note> great Kings and Emperors to a place, with a great deal of pomp and oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to ſay, Here it comes, and there it goeth; but it is after a ſpiritual and inviſible maner; even as the wind, which ſeemeth to be nothing, we cannot ſee it with the eye, or feel it with the hand, yet it hath mighty and powerful operations: As it was with Chriſt himſelf, he was in a deſpicable form, a worm and no man, accounted amongſt the wicked, when yet he was at the ſame time a glorious and infinite God; but yet becauſe of that outward appearance, they deſpiſed him, <hi>Is not this the Carpenters Son; And he was accounted of no reputation:</hi> Even ſo it is with the called ones of God, they are ſuch that the world deſpiſeth, contemneth, the learned ones and great ones of the world, they do none of theſe things; not conſidering what rich jewels are in theſe courſe Cabinets: So that as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is he that is not offended at me;</hi> ſo alſo, bleſſed is he that is not offended at the way and manner of Gods calling: But now let us go into this Temple, and behold the wonderful works of God. And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The grace of God it ſelf in calling any, though never ſo few, is with heart and mouth to be always acknowledged: God who had his onely <note place="margin">1.</note> ſon to delight in, and millions of Angels to ſerve him, that he ſhould call thee ſo poor, ſo weak, ſo inconſiderable, this ſhould ſet thee upon the very pinacle of admiration. How often do you ſee <hi>Paul</hi> gathering up this manna, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day, like a true ſpiritual <hi>Dives,</hi> he fareth deliciouſly upon comfortable me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, ſometimes the grace of God, ſometimes the riches of his grace, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the unſearchable riches of his grace: Oh how unexcuſable are the people of God for their unthankfulneſs, dulneſs, and unbelief in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar! They are not affected to raviſhment with the grace of God calling them, they do not aggravate every meditation, they do not ſet home every thing that may make their ſouls run over, to make them ſay, O Lord, my heart ſuffers vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence within me, I can hold no longer; thy love, thy grace in calling me, doth even overwhelm me.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The time and ſeaſon when God calls his people, deſerves meditation:</hi> Not onely mercies themſelves, but the times and ſeaſons of them, are wiſely or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <note place="margin">2. Meditate of the time and ſeoſon when God calls.</note> by God: Some God calls in the morning, ſome in the noon, ſome in the evening of their age: And to every one, this grace of God hath its full mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of conſideration; he that is called betimes, he may conſider Gods goodneſs to him ſo early, that God thought on him ſo quickly; he might have gone on and provoked God, carrying guilt and a ſadded conſcience, even to the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grave: He heareth others cry out, O Lord, it troubleth me I loved thee no ſooner; Oh how much time have I loſt! how ſhall I recover and redeem thoſe loſt hours, and loſt days? but as for thee, God inſtructed thee betimes to take heed of ſin: He that is called at the latter end of his days, having the guilt of many ſins upon him, he alſo may be quickned to glorifie God, that he would not deſpiſe him for all his rebellions, that he would not remember all his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindeneſſes, that ſuch a long and old enemy of his ſhould be taken into favor: yea, at that very time when they have been in full purſuit of their luſts, hath God called them, as it was with <hi>Paul,</hi> yea, and is to every man; When, Lord, I was thinking and working evil againſt thee, thou waſt preparing good for me; when I, Lord, had no delight, but in my luſts, and thoſe things that did grieve
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:30767:327"/>
thy ſpirit, even then thy thoughts of kindeneſs were to me: Oh think on theſe things! what, is there nothing but your children, your husbands, your wives, your temporal mercies to be delighted in? Yes, that grace of God calling thee ſhould poſſeſs thy whole man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The perſons whom God calleth:</hi> They afford many conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; As <note place="margin">3. The perſons God cal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>They are the meaneſt in outward condition:</hi> If you read the Evangeliſts, you ſhall finde, that the greateſt part of perſons called, were of no pomp, no noiſe or fame in the world: Though the material Temple was built of precious ſtone, and excellent wood, and adorned with gold, whereby it was the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficenteſt wonder in the world; yet there is no ſuch beauty in the ſpiritual Temple of God, in his Church and children: This hath always been objected againſt the ways of Chriſt. <hi>Julian</hi> objected it, the Papiſts objected it againſt our Martyrs, that ſuffered by their cruel violence: Now God hath delighted to take ſuch a way, not onely in heavenly things, but even in the Government of the world, he hath many times ſhewed ſuch remarkable paſſages: <hi>Joſeph</hi> a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible priſoner, hath his irons taken off, and he is admitted to the greateſt honor in the Land: <hi>Moſes,</hi> from what contemptible originals, did he ariſe to be the chief Governor of the people; and thus <hi>David</hi> alſo! So that as God to make himſelf glorious in the outward Government of the world, hath advanced men of no degree; thus he makes heirs to the incorruptible crown of glory, men accounted as dung and off-ſcouring of the world: Take heed then, that as the Phariſees looked for a glorious Meſſias, and that was their ſtumbling block; ſo thou alſo look for the great, and rich, and mighty men of the world, to be as they are, to live as they do, and that prove thy ſpiritual undoing: Oh the wiſdom and goodneſs of God! how unſearchable his ways? thoſe who have ſcarce cloathes to cover their nakedneſs, ſhall have the crown of glory, and the robes of immortality upon them; thoſe who have ſcarce a cottage to live in, ſhall be ſet on thrones of glory; thoſe who are deſpiſed and contemned by men, are highly priſed by God, and loved by Angels: <hi>This honor have all the Saints.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider alſo, <hi>That the perſons called, are many times the worſt of men, great and hainous ſinners:</hi> As they are the meaneſt for their external con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <note place="margin">II. The worſt.</note> ſo the worſt for their Moralities, that all the world may be convinced, and ſay, It was not ſuch a mans goodneſs, his ingenuity, his honeſt endeavors, his willing deſires, but God ſpake unto him, <hi>while wallowing in hit blood, To live.</hi> The Phariſees, who gloried in an external ſtrictneſs, and knew no further then an outward godlineſs, did upon this conſideration, labor to defame Chriſt and his Doctrine, that he kept company with publicans and ſinners; as the Iſraelites murmured that <hi>Moſes</hi> married a Blackamoor, and as the contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vileſt of men followed <hi>David;</hi> ſo it was a great ſtumbling block, that Chriſt called great ſinners to repentance, that he rejected the Phariſees, the ſeeming glory of the world. Our Saviour in many places he diſcovers, that prophane and open ſinners, did ſooner obtain the kingdom of heaven, then thoſe civil, moral men; and if you diligently eye Gods way, you ſhall finde it ſtill true, <hi>That the rich he ſendeth empty away, and the hungry he fills with good things;</hi> that none are further from being effectually called, then ſuch who ſay, They are full, rich, and want nothing; their own righteouſneſs, their own goodneſs, their own ſelf-ſufficiency, is that which beareth up their hearts; and being thus whole in their own apprehenſions, they ſeek out for no phyſitian: Oh its worthy of our ſerious conſideration, to take notice of how many thouſands are forſaken and paſſed over by God, who are perſwaded all is well with them. Deſpairing men are but few to preſuming men, they are like the ſands upon the ſea ſhore; go from one man to another, and you ſhall finde them all content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in themſelves; there are no groans for Chriſt, there are no pantings for a

So that as the Apoſtle ſaith about preaching of the Goſpel, <hi>We preach not the wiſdom of this world,</hi> ſo neither are thoſe who are called, the wiſe men of this world: So that as worldly politicians laugh at the plain ſimplicity of thoſe who truly fear God, and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Laſtly, This is no mean thing to obſerve in Gods effectual calling, <hi>That he</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">IV. The feweſt.</note> 
                     <hi>chooſeth the feweſt number of mankinde:</hi> As God hath not choſen many wiſe, or many great ones, ſo not many men, comparatively to thoſe millions of men, that he lets alone in the dungeon of their dark luſts: And truly this matter is full of terror, we have cauſe to tremble while we think of it, that ſuch a little flock Chriſt ſhould chooſe to himſelf; that the remnant of mankinde that ſhall be ſaved, ſhould be no more then the remnant after an harveſt or vintage: This our Saviour doth often preſs as a truth, that hath a ſharp edge to enter into every mans conſcience; if any thing in the world may ſtartle thee out of thy ſecurity, it muſt be this, <hi>That few are choſen,</hi> God hath effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led but a very little handful of men to eternal glory: You that make multitude an argument for your evil ways, and think its good to ſay, The moſt do this, the greateſt part go this way: Oh the Scripture tells you, what will become of moſt men; its not for us preſumptuouſly to pry into the ſecret ways of God, neither may we impudently expoſtulate, Why God ſhould leave the greater part of mankinde, in their deſperate and undone eſtate; it is enough for us to acknowledge Gods ſoveraignty herein, with fear and trembling. So then, hath God called but few? how poſſible is it for thee to be none of that ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; but eight perſons were preſerved in the Ark, when all others were drowned by the overflowing waters: Thus we have cauſe to behold the manner of Gods effectual calling of his people.</p>
                  <p>Uſe therefore of Exhortation, To take notice of the ways of God herein; <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> it hath been the Rock that many thouſands have ſplit themſelves at, they have not wiſely conſidered of this: What is the reaſon ſo many preſume of their ſalvation, think its but putting out the hand, and they may when they will take this crown of glory? Why do the greateſt part of men eat and drink in ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, bleſſing themſelves, ſaying, If death comes, if ſickneſs comes, it ſhall go well with them; all is from this, they conſider not that, that God calls but a few, the greater part of men will be damned: This ſhould make thy heart
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:30767:329"/>
quake for fear; its the Scripture truth, not our ſcare-Crow, you do not love to hear this ſpoken of; but Chriſt thought it fit to reveal it to the world, that the very foundations thereof may ſhake. Again, what is the reaſon ſo many are offended at the condition of godly men; that the ways of God are ſuch a ſtumbling block? They do not rightly conſider of Gods calling, they look that Chriſts Kingdom ſhould be of this world, they expect the wiſdom of the world, the greatneſs of the world, the wealth of the world; and God hath deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined a clean contrary way. When <hi>John</hi> ſent to Chriſt, to know whether he was the Meſſiah or no, he returneth this Anſwer, <hi>The blinde are made to ſee, the lame are healed, the poor receive the Goſpel, and bleſſed is he that is not offended at me.</hi> Prejudices and carnal cavils againſt godlineſs, are the deſtruction of many thouſands. Now it we will wiſely conſider of Gods calling his people out of ſin, we ſhall attain to theſe notable Inſtructions:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We ſhall never judge our ſelves happy by any external greatneſs; and the <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> which humane wiſdom pitched upon, will be found ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Magnum malum,</hi> an hinderance of that which is the greateſt good indeed; yet when will the world be perſwaded otherwiſe? How contrary are Gods thoughts to thy thoughts? how oppoſite are thy apprehenſions, to his purpoſes? He layeth aſide the wiſe things, the great things, the glorious things of the world: Oh you, that have theſe external advantages, fear they be not ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al diſadvantages! Little cauſe there is to boaſt of theſe, if thou kneweſt all; Theſe are the bunches in the Camels back, theſe are the ſnares to thy feet, the milſtones about thy neck: Be then afraid, and think, If I had been poor, and were afflicted, I had been in a more hopeful condition. Diſciples muſt follow Chriſt, and they can beſt follow, who have the leaſt burthens: Oh judge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing great outwardly, that may make thee little ſpiritually; count thoſe things curſed, that may hinder thee from being bleſſed.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Give God the glory of all the grace and ſpiritual mercies that he <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> vouchſafeth to thee; For who art thou, and in what to be accounted of, that art called by God? did thy greatneſs procure it? thy goodneſs deſerve it? doth not God all things, to ſtop the mouthes of men, that there may be no boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>That none ſhould glory in his preſence?</hi> Humility and thankfulneſs is beſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Chriſtian called, nothing doth ſo become him; For what hath he that he hath not received? who hath made him to differ from others, that hapl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THe paſſage introductory of the matter contained in the Text, hath been diſpatched. Let us obſerve the particulars of the diſtribution, which the Apoſtle here intendeth: And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There is that which is a Goddeſs, as it were, in the world, admired by all; <hi>Not many wiſe men.</hi> Several Countries have heretofore ſtriven about the appropriating of the famous ſeven wiſe men to themſelves; ſome ſtriving to make this man their Countrey man, others to make that: But here you ſee God paſſing over ſuch, and chooſing the babes and fooliſh ones of the world: So that you have the perſons paſſed by, deſcribed, firſt, By their abſolute qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, <hi>Not many wiſe,</hi> 2. By a reſtriction or limitation of this wiſdom, <hi>Not many wiſe men after the fieſh.</hi> Now wiſdom after the fleſh may have a twofold ſenſe; as fleſh hath, 1. That which is earthly, corrupt, and ſinful craftineſs, which the Scripture in many places ſpeaks againſt. 2. For Humane civil prudence; as fleſh is ſometimes uſed for man, denoting indeed weakneſs, becauſe not God or Angel, but not ſinfulneſs: And this political civil prudence, is a natural perfection, and a good gift of God; yea, its a duty, to which the people of God are exhorted; but even of ſuch political wiſe men, God doth not chooſe many, though ſome he doth: Thus <hi>Solomon</hi> had ſuch wiſdom to admiration; and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">God chooſeth ſome wiſe men</note> is noted for a wiſeman, becauſe <hi>Tyre</hi> is reproved for her fooliſh confidence, thinking her ſelf wiſer then <hi>Daniel, Ezek.</hi> 28. 3. and <hi>Heman,</hi> that made the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Pſalm of one troubled and afflicted in conſcience, diſtracted with the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of the Lord daily, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 4. 31. yet the Scripture ſpeaks of him as one of the great wiſe men in his time. We read of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> a man ſo politically wiſe, that his counſel was accounted as the Oracle of God, yet he was rejected by God, and his wiſdom proved fatal to him; but of this more in time. For the preſent conſider, how the Apoſtle doth imply a diſtinction of neceſſary uſe, about wiſdom, onely he names one part of the diſtribution, <hi>A wiſdom after the fleſh,</hi> the compleat ſenſe is this, There is an heavenly wiſdom, a wiſdom after the ſpirit, highly eſteemed by God, which all that are called do partake of: And there is <hi>A wiſdom after the fleſh,</hi> in an earthly, carnal, and worldly manner, when <note place="margin">Of the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the fleſh, and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the ſpirit.</note> men ſavor not the things of God, but what makes for their own advantages; inſomuch, that the Scripture ſometimes deſcribes them by this, <hi>That they are wiſe to do evil, Ier.</hi> 4. 22. I purpoſe to ſpeak ſomething largely to this head; for godlineſs is reputed of, as folly, madneſs, and ſimplicity; and fleſhly or crafty practices, or ſublime and high reaches, theſe are judged the onely wiſdom in the world. Let a man ſet upon the powerful way of godlineſs, let him endeavor to walk upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:30767:330"/>
not conforming himſelf to the preſent courſe of the world, he is preſently branded for an unwiſe man; he immediately looſeth all his reputation: As <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> ſaid in his days, when a wiſe conſiderable man turned Chriſtian, they would ſay, <hi>Miror quod Cajus vir bonus &amp; ſapiens fit Chriſtianus,</hi> I wonder ſuch a wiſe and prudent man will turn Chriſtian.</p>

                  <p>He that ſpeaks of a wiſdom after the fleſh, neceſſarily ſuppoſeth a wiſdom of a more excellent and admirable nature, even that which is after the ſpirit: Though you call a man able to tranſact matters of great importance, who is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of the times and ſeaſons for all things to be done, a great wiſe man; yet there is a wiſdom far tranſcending all this; and that is, in heavenly matters, to know how to walk in a pleaſing way to God, and at laſt; to partake of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting happineſs by him: The Theam of wiſdom hath been often treated on by the Heathen, but their eyes were upon this glorious ſubject, like thoſe of the Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s or the Owls to the reſplendent Sun beams. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> when he ſpeaks more ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, makes wiſdom to be the knowledge of more excellent and heavenly things, with the cauſes of them; but at other times, he makes wiſdom to be the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any Arts or Sciences. But I ſhall ſpeak of wiſdom, as the Scripture uſeth it: And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, It is taken for original and ſubſtantial wiſdom; and thus God is ſaid <hi>To be the onely wiſe God,</hi> Rom. 16. 27. Why art thou repining and diſcontented at the hand of God, though never ſo heavy on thee? God is the onely wiſe God; none hath wiſdom but he? And thus Chriſt is often in the Parables called Wiſdom; he is the increated wiſdom; and as he was the Mediator, the treaſures of wiſdom were hid in him.</p>
                  <p>Further, in the Scripture, wiſdom is ſometimes uſed, for thoſe abilities men have to diſcharge their callings and relations; ſo <hi>Aholiab</hi> and <hi>Bezaleel</hi> are ſaid <hi>To be filled with wiſdom by God for that work of the tabernaele;</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi> had wiſdom given him, to be a skillful Pilote, to govern the ſhip of the Commonwealth committed to his truſt.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes wiſdom is taken for the worldly crafty ſhifts and abilities men have to contrive miſchievous deſigns, or ſave themſelves from danger.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes for an opinion or conceit that men have of themſelves, as wiſe, when indeed they are but empty ſhadows. And</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, For true godlines, in which ſenſe the Scripture often uſeth it, making <hi>the fear of God the beginning of wiſdom;</hi> &amp; condemning all wicked menfor fools, <hi>Deu.</hi> 4. 6.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, let us obſerve in what this wiſdom is diſcovered: And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Its not acquired by ſtudy,</hi> and experience, and a prompt quick nature much working with theſe, as humane prudence is; humane wiſe men are both born and <note place="margin">

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The rule of this wiſdom is the word of God: The Scriptures are able</hi>

<pb n="608" facs="tcp:30767:331"/>
by theſe Authors; yet the childe of God deriveth all his wiſdom from the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: Thoſe Proverbs of <hi>Solomon</hi> may be called a Treaſury of wiſdom; What hath a man to do as a man, as a Chriſtian, as in any Office, Relation or Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for which he may not fetch Divine rules from thence? Thus in <hi>Deut.</hi> 4. 6. a place alledged before; all Nations would wonder, and ſay, What a wiſe and great people were the Jews, who had theſe wiſe and holy Commandments to walk by? and needs muſt the word of God be the rule of all wiſdom, becauſe its the word of a wiſe God, he knoweth all things better then we can: Oh then take heed of leaning to thy own underſtanding, of hearkning to carnal counſel, againſt the word of God; for what that bids thee do, and what that bids thee foroear, thou wilt finde to be the wiſeſt counſel that may be. Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>What will it profit a man, to win the whole world, and looſe his own ſoul?</hi> yet thou deſpiſeſt this counſel, if thou hadſt many ſouls, thou wouldſt damn them, to get a little part of the world; now thou thinkeſt thy ſelf ſo wiſe in this, thou bleſſeſt thy ſelf, and applaudeſt thy own wiſdom: Oh remember, Gods word is wiſdom, he is a wiſe man, that thinketh and believeth, and practiſeth accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Wiſdom from above, is ſeen in the diſcerning and judging of what are the most excellent things:</hi> What is true, and what is falſe, what is good, and <note place="margin">3.</note> what is evil; what is to be imbraced, and what is to be ſhunned, <hi>Sapiens eſt cui res ſapiunt prout ſunt,</hi> He is a wiſe man, to whom things are repreſented and perceived as they are. That is a diſtempered palate, which judgeth the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign and excellent meat bitter and loathſom: Its a great glory attributed to the ſpiritual man, <hi>The ſpiritual man judgeth all things, and he himſelf is judged of no man,</hi> 1 Cor, 2. 14. A ſpiritual man, ſo far as he is ſpiritual, is indowed with that admirable knowledge, as that he can judge between good and evil; they have their ſenſes exerciſed to make this difference: And herein lieth a great part of heavenly wiſdom, it quickly diſcovereth what are the ſins that will prove de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful or dangerous to him: If the very beaſts have a natural inſtinct to difference that which is good to them, from that which is hurtful; how much more doth God give ſuch neceſſary wiſdom to his own children: To every wicked man we may ſay, Thou fool, who ſwalloweſt down thy poyſon, who deſperately wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and damneſt thy own ſoul, yet takeſt no notice of it; when wilt thou be wiſe? when wilt thou ſeek out for underſtanding? We ſay of the bodily health, every man is either a fool, or a Phyſician; its certain, every ungodly man is a fool, and no Phyſician about his ſoul; he knoweth not what is good for him, he doth not wiſely conſider what is for his advantage, and ſpiritual welfare: Give me (ſaith he) that which is pleaſant or profitable, though it damn me.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>True wiſdom lieth in propounding a good and happy end to a mans</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>ſelf, the enjoyment whereof will make a man indeed happy:</hi> The ultimate end of a man, is that wherein his happineſs doth conſiſt; now we read, even among wiſe men, how much this hath been diſputed; ſome placed it in riches, ſome in honors, ſome in pleaſures; and certainly, there are many men, who propound the ſame happineſs with beaſts, even an earthly, ſenſual pleaſure: The Apoſtle deſcribeth ſuch, <hi>Whoſe belly is their God, who minde earthly things,</hi> Phil. 3. 19. and <hi>David</hi> on the other ſide, deſcribeth his utmoſt end, when he ſaith, <hi>Whom have I in heaven but thee, and whom in earth in compariſon of thee?</hi> And often he makes God his Portion, his Shepherd, his all in all: So then, conſider with thy ſelf, its the great part of wiſdom, to propound ſome end to our ſelves in all our actions, otherwiſe we act irrationally: Its the firſt queſtion in good Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſms, What ought to be the chiefeſt and higheſt end of every man in this life: Hence, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his Moral Phyloſophy, doth firſt treat of the end of all humane actions as the chiefeſt thing, and if that be not firſt determined, we ſhoot at rovers: So ſome Divines ſay, becauſe Divinity is wholly practical, we muſt firſt inform, what is the chief end of all our duties, why we live and move, why we eat and drink, why we have a being in this world, and at what mark we
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:30767:331" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are to ſhoot: Is it then the glory of God, the enjoyment of him, and ſalvation of thy own ſoul, that thou aimeſt at? If from morning to evening, and again, from evening to morning, thou art ſet upon this; then art thou a wiſe man: But O the folly and ſimplicity of moſt men, who have no greater ends, then to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and glorious in this world! and although experience teacheth them the vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of riches, the uncertainty of honors, and the Tragical ends of all earthly great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet they are reſolved for no other courſe: Oh that you who read the Bible, profeſs your ſelves Chriſtians, acknowledge a day of judgement, believe a reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead, ſhould yet be bowed down to theſe earthly things! O boaſt not any longer, in that thou art wiſe for to get great things in this world! for that ſhould not be the utmoſt end; and nothing is happy, but in proportion to its ultimate felicity: Shew thy ſelf a rational man; To what end do I labor and weary my ſelf all day? What is it that my ſoul would have? what doth it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire? Can any thing but God ſatisfie it? can I have any reſt or quietneſs in my ſpirit, till the light of his countenance ſhine upon me? Canſt thou ſit down with <hi>Jonah,</hi> though not with ſuch impatiency, and ſeeing a worm devouring thy gourd, ſomething or other conſuming thy outward hopes, cry out, <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is vanity;</hi> the Lord onely ſatisfieth and ſufficeth my ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>True wiſdom lieth in the election or choice, and full execution of all thoſe means which conduce to that end:</hi> Election is a great part of wiſdom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning means, as well as intention about the end: Now as God, and the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, is the onely end, thus godlineſs and holineſs is the onely way: See you a man ſtudious of godlineſs, careful not to ſin or to offend God; this man is a wiſe man, becauſe he keepeth in the direct way to his end: The paths of godlineſs end at laſt in happineſs; and therefore godlineſs is ſo often called <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>The fear of the Lord.</hi> by which men depart from ſin, and dare not offend him: though accounted a fooliſh preciſe thing, yet its the beginning of all wiſdom; Who then is a wiſe man, and a prudent? even ſuch an one who chooſeth thoſe ways, and is diligent in thoſe actions that make for eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs: Oh if thou couldſt leave off thoſe pleaſures of ſin, if thou couldſt pray more frequently, reform more ſtudiouſly, thou wouldſt finde this the ſum of all wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>True heavenly wiſdom lieth in circumſpection, and a diligent caution;</hi> and that two ways: Firſt, To let go no opportunity that may advance grace or happineſs: <hi>Walk circumſpectly, not as fools, but as wiſe,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 15. and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is that ſeen? <hi>By redeeming the time, becauſe the days are evil:</hi> Oh thou art then wiſe, when thou conſidereſt, My days are ſhort, the opportunities of grace are few, I have been too long already a ſervant to ſin, I will therefore take all occaſions to further godlineſs; What hurt and hindrance is thy ſpiritual folly and imprudence to thee? He is accounted the wiſe Merchant, that takes the ſeaſons and opportunities for his traffiquing: And thus it is for heavenly things; there is a ſeaſon and opportunity, which if thou neglect, which if thou let paſs, it may never be recovered again: This is called wiſe to do good. Secondly, This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection, lieth in the avoiding of all the temptations of ſin and Satan, which are very ſubtil; and unleſs a Chriſtian be an <hi>Argus,</hi> all over eyes, he cannot eſcape deſtruction by them. The little Horn in <hi>Daniel,</hi> was ſaid to be full of eyes: Some Interpreters make that the Turkiſh power and government, which was baſe and contemptible at firſt, but by their care and induſtry, and diligent watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, ſignified by thoſe eyes, did preſently biggen into a great Dominion: Thus even a godly man is to be full of eyes; for the deceits of luſts are many, and the methods of Satan are wilely and crafty; therefore its an high degree of wiſdom to eſcape all theſe, whereas the fool goeth on blindefold. Every ſin, every tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation of Satan, is a pit and ſnare to entrap him.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Wiſdom conſiſts in foreſight and providence:</hi> To look to preſent pleaſures or preſent advantages, not conſidering the future, is a part of a fool: <hi>He is blinde, not able to ſee afar off,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. Hence the life of a
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:30767:332"/>
Chriſtian is compared to Watching. A Watchman on the Tower, is able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Enemy a far off approaching: Now this foreſight conſiſts in two things:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To prevent after-repentings, that will be full of horror and perplexity, <note place="margin">1.</note> but wholly vain: Thus the damned in hell are brought in, calling upon the hills and mountains to cover them, that they may avoid the wrath of the Lamb: <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſapientis est dicere non putabam:</hi> Fools uſe to ſay, I did not think this, I never thought the miſeries and guilt of ſin, the flames of hell, the horror of conſcience would have been thus horrible: He then that is wiſe, looks upon ſin and the world, as one in hell would look on them, with amazement and aſtoniſhment, endeavoring to fly from it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Foreſight lieth in attending to our latter end, that the preſent time <note place="margin">2.</note> quickly flieth away: <hi>Oh that my people were wiſe,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>that they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their latter end,</hi> Deut. 32. 29. This is heavenly wiſdom, to conſider, that the preſent pleaſures and advantages will immediately dye: The time is coming, when thou wilt, lie languiſhing on thy deaths-bed, that all friends and worldly comforts will take their leave of thee: This conſideration would be a ſpecial preſervative againſt ſin; though the thoughts of death, and making up thy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt, are for the time bitter, yet they will make for thy future good: O then how fooliſh and bruitiſh are the greateſt part of men! they never conſider what will become of them, when dying, when ſtanding at Gods Tribunal: Oh they think not what confuſion will be on their faces, to ſee themſelves caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to utter darkneſs, when others are received, to be commanded to depart, as thoſe that are curſed, into everlaſting fire.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Herein lieth provident wiſdom, to forecaſt for eternity, that we may <note place="margin">3.</note> be happy for ever: Alas! no mans happineſs conſiſts in enjoying the great and glorious things of this life; no more then the Malefactor in the priſon, that fareth deliciouſly, may be called an happy man, when he is immediately to be called out to the place of execution: Yet who can ever perſwade the world, that there is any other wiſdom, then to get the good things of this life? Give me to day (ſaith the prophane man) take thou to morrow; give me this life, take thou eternity. O beaſts, rather then men! yet ſuch worms are we, and no men: The Scripture doth repreſent eternity ſo diſtinctly, whether of happineſs or miſery; that its a wonder men ſhould no more meditate about it, that they cry not out, O Eternity, eternity, to be with the Lord for ever, or the Devils and damned for ever: Oh this <hi>for ever,</hi> what an overwhelming word is it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe of Inſtruction:</hi> Who is the true wiſe man? not a man of the greateſt <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> parts, of the greateſt reach and craft; but one who is made wiſe by God, hath the Scripture the rule of his wiſdom, and performs all thoſe forementioned acts. This man is more wiſe then <hi>Solomon</hi> in ſome reſpects; yea, if all the learning and prudence of all the men in the world were put into one mans head, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out grace, he hath not ſo much knowledge and wiſdom as the weakeſt babe in Chriſt: Oh when all accompts are caſt up, and there will come to be a final de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of all things, then all the world will ſee, who is a wiſe man, and who is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>YOu have heard of a wiſdom ſecretly implied by this diſtinctive expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Apoſtle, <hi>Wiſe men after the fleſh,</hi> viz. That there is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent heavenly wiſdome, which is a wiſdome after the Spirit. And this is indeed the true proper wiſdome.

                  <p>The Devil at firſt made uſe of the Serpent to deceive mankinde, as being more ſubtil then any beaſt of the field; but God he takes <hi>the fooliſh things of the world to confound the wiſe.</hi> That as our Saviour in another caſe ſaid, <hi>That which is highly eſteemed amongst men, is abominable before God;</hi> So it is here, That which the world magnifieth, which it adoreth; is caſt away as refuſe and droſſe by God. Thoſe things which the world reverenceth as Idols of gold, God many times makes fire-brands in hell: So greatly do Gods thoughts and mans differ.</p>
                  <p>To open this let us conſider, What are the Characters and Properties of wiſe <note place="margin">The characters and properties of wiſemen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh. 1. They reliſh only wordly things.</note> men after the fleſh. And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>They are ſuch who have a deep judgement and ſavoury taſte about worldly things, the pleaſures and profit of ſin, but no apprehenſion or reliſh at all about hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things. Sapiens a Sapore,</hi> becauſe he findes a taſte and experimental ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the object he is converſant about. Now as the heavenly wiſe man he findes a ſweet reliſh in heavenly things, as you ſee by <hi>Davids</hi> many expreſſions about the word of God, and the enjoyment of God; So the earthly wiſe man he hath a ſavoury pleaſing taſte in theſe inferiour comforts: As <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt put more gladneſſe in my heart, then they have had when their wine and oyl increaſeth,</hi> Pſa. 4. So theſe have more joy in the increaſe of their profit and pleaſures, then in any Ordinances or religious Worſhip of God: As <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>His ſoul breaketh for the longing it hath alwayes to the Commandments of God:</hi> So his ſoul even breaks for the longing it hath to the accompliſhment of all its luſts and deſires. If you then would have a true deſcription of the worldly wiſe man, it is eminently in this, He hath a delight and ſweet ſavour in the enjoying of all
<pb n="612" facs="tcp:30767:334"/>
fleſhly luſts. He findes no delight in God, no ſweetneſſe in Ordinances, no joy in the holy Ghoſt. His affections are ſet upon earthly things and not heavenly. As the Swine delights not in pleaſant gardens and medows, but in dirty and miery places; ſo neither doth the fleſhly wiſe man take any joy in the acts of Religion, he knoweth not the meaning of the ſweetneſſe and excellency of any grace, but is carried out in all the delight of his ſoul upon theſe earthly objects. His thoughts are there, his affections there, his diſcourſe and words there; and herein you may even admire to ſee what parts, skill and diſcerning many men have in the matters of the world, but in matters of Religion meer Ideots and very fools. Oh they will one day ſee their madneſſe! Could I tell the way to grow rich, and not the way to Heaven? Could I tell how to ſave my ſelf here, and not to ſave my ſoul hereafter? Oh then be aſhamed all you who have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and parts about worldly things, but ſtark ignorant men in matters of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Wiſemen after the fleſh as they ſavour only the things of the fleſh, ſo</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2. They have an incurable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the things of God.</note> 
                     <hi>they have an irreconcilable enmity to the things of God.</hi> The more fleſhly wiſdome and humane craft a man hath, the more wretched enemy and adverſary he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to what is good; they are the great politick wiſe men that do moſt abhor and ſcorn Religion. Thus the Apoſtle <hi>Rom. 8. The wiſdom of the fleſh is enmity againſt God;</hi> what a brand and black infamy doth this Text caſt upon all ſubtil wiſe men; Their wiſdom (that which they boaſt of, they glory in, the beſt they have, which the world admireth them for) this is enmity, not diſlike, not diſtaſte or averſneſſe, but enmity the higheſt degree of oppoſition; and enmity in the abſtract, nothing but enmity: There is not a crum or a drop of any love or compliance with the things of God. That as the Serpent, though a wiſe crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet is full of poiſon and venom; ſuch are all men of parts, and wit, and quick abilities, if not ſanctified; They have wiſdom but againſt God; they have wit but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt godlines; they have craft but to oppoſe godlines: So that many men would have had eaſier condemnation at the day of Judgment, if they had been fools and mad men, rather then ſuch wiſe men; better thou wert a man driven out of thy wits, raving and talking thou doſt not know what, then to be ſo adviſedly and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beratly oppoſing of the waies of God: O then conſider, whether the more wiſdom and the more parts thou haſt, thou art not the more atheiſtical, the more crafty adverſary to what is holy. Whether that be not the only obſtacle, why thou doſt not ſubmit to the waies of God; Thy luſts do not hinder thee, thy prophaneneſſe doth not hinder thee, but thy carnal policy, and thy fleſhly wiſdom, becauſe godlineſſe is a way of ſelf-denial, of danger and oppoſition in this world; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thy heart cannot comply with it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The wiſe men after the fleſh they are ſubtil to invent diſtinctions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. Subtil to cover ſinne.</note> 
                     <hi>to palliate and cover their ſins.</hi> God tels the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> by the Prophet, <hi>That they dug deep, and did hide their counſels low, covering themſelves, but not with the covering of Gods Spirit,</hi> Iſa. 30. 1. This wiſdom after the fleſh, <hi>Adam</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon his fall gave a teſtimony of, when he put off his ſinne from himſelf to <hi>Eve,</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> again upon the Serpent. It was <hi>Sauls</hi> wiſdom after the fleſh that made him diſobey Gods Commandment, making fair pretences; And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Hoſca</hi> bringeth in the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> who by unjuſt and unlawful waies did heap up treaſure, comforting himſelf with this, <hi>There ſhould no iniquity be found in him,</hi> Hoſ. 12. 8. And thoſe falſe teachers who brought in the worſhipping of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, <hi>They had fleſhly wiſdom,</hi> as the Apoſtle cals it, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 23. All the evaſions, diſtinctions and palliations that men have either to cover their ſins, or to extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate them, or to make them no ſins, are the ſole iſſue of fleſhly wiſdome; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are exceedingly deceived, if you think drunkenneſſe, fornication and ſuch ſins of the fleſh are only damnable; no there is the wiſdome of the fleſh; There is a fleſhly minde, a corrupt minde, which the Scripture makes damnable as well as theſe. Thoſe many diſtinctions in Popery about worſhipping of Images,
<pb n="613" facs="tcp:30767:332"/>
which are ſo ſubtil that a Papiſt himſelf ſaith, A man muſt have <hi>Ingenium valde metaphyſicum</hi> that can tell how to underſtand them, are nothing but wiſdom af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh. All ſuperſtitious worſhip is a wiſdom after the fleſh. And as in matters of Religion, ſo in matters of morality, all ſubtil pretences, all ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous evaſions that men have, when they commit any ſinne, or do any unlawful actions, theſe are poiſoned ſtreams from that poiſoned fountain of fleſhly wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Oh then take heed of pleading for thy ſins, of diſtinctions in ſinning, of endeavouring to make that lawful which thy conſcience tels thee is unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful! This ſeeming carnal wiſdome will turn at laſt to horrour and deſpair of ſoul. Thou wilt then ſee thou didſt but mock God, and delude thy own conſcience.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Wiſe men after the fleſh they are ſubtil, crafty and induſtrious to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh</hi>

Their hearts are compared to the Bakers Oven, <hi>(Hoſ.</hi> 76, 7.) that is heated, wherein all their miſchievous intents are perfected: <hi>David</hi> often complaineth of ſuch crafty deceitful men, whoſe tongues were ſharper then ſwords, when their words were ſmoother then butter.

Thou canſt over-reach, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, deceive others: Oh remember, Chriſt hath called us to be ſheep and not foxes! Remember this thy wiſdom will prove folly; for doth not God ſay, <hi>He will deſtroy the wiſdom of the wiſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. And doth not the Lord <hi>take the wiſe in their own craft?</hi> Do they not dig their own graves? Do they not fall in the pit they make for others?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Wiſe men after the fleſh they are conceited and puffed up with this wiſdom,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5. Proud.</note> They are ſwoln bladders puffed up with the empty winde that is in them. <hi>He that thinketh he knoweth any thing, knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know,</hi> 1 Cor. 8. 2. Oh it is a great matter to know as we ought to know; now the carnal wiſe man knoweth nothing as he ought to know; He knoweth not the matter as he ought to know, nor the manner; Not the matter; for <hi>Paul</hi> deſired to <hi>know nothing but Jeſus Christ and him crucified,</hi> 1 Cor. 2. And again, <hi>He accounted all things dung and droſſe, for the excellency of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3. And the Apoſtle would not have men glory in their riches, or in their might and power, yet in this, that they know God; now the wiſdom of the fleſh doth not inable us to know God or Chriſt, not God as revealed in his Word, therefore ſuch wiſe men do ſo often diſhonour him and break his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and are refractory under his judgements, not Chriſt; for none can know him, but ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> that account their own righteouſneſſe dung, that go out of themſelves, as poor, naked and miſerable: But alas, wiſe men after the fleſh cannot do any of theſe. And then for the manner, they ought to know all things two waies: Firſt, Humbly, with ſenſe of their great ignorance, as <hi>Agar</hi> though ſo wiſe, ſaith, <hi>He had not the knowledge of a man,</hi> Prov. 30. 23. <hi>that he was a beaſt and no man;</hi> Now the carnally wiſe are proud and arrogant, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that Motto which the <hi>Romans</hi> gave to their god <hi>Terminus</hi> that bounded their goods, <hi>Nulli ced<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and remote from grace, and in ſuch oppoſition to Chriſt, as carnally wiſe men, becauſe the firſt foundation that is to be laid in Chriſtianity, is to caſt off all our own wiſdom, our own knowledge, <hi>He muſt become a fool that he may be wiſe,</hi> ſo the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 18. Now to become a fool by way of conception in the worlds account, and by our ſenſe and feeling is, when we ſee our ſins, the aggravations of them, the eternal miſery accompanying them, and that all this is done by our own madneſſe and folly: Oh what a fool, what a beaſt is ſuch an one become in his own thoughts! He could even with <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the company of men, and hide himſelf with beaſts, becauſe he hath ſo greatly ſinned againſt God; ſuch a fool muſt a man become ere he is ſpiritually wiſe; and further he is to become a fool, becauſe all the way of believing, of comfort, of duty, of obedience, he muſt fetch onely from directions out of the Scripture. He is ſuch a fool that he knoweth not how to believe, how to go to Chriſt, what way to take to be juſtified: Thus every man is to become a fool: But oh what indignation and ſcorn is in a wiſe mans breſt to become thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated, as it were! yet our Saviour alſo doth pregnantly confirm this, when he ſaid, <hi>Unleſſe a man become as a little childe</hi> (Lnk. 9. 47.) <hi>he cannot enter into the kingdom of Heaven.</hi> You ſee then, that of all men in the world, thoſe who have great parts, abilities and deep reaches, have the greateſt cauſe to tremble. Thou art too wiſe to be godly; Thou art too wiſe to be a babe of Chriſts; Thou art too wiſe to deny thy ſelf, and take up thy croſſe and follow him. Take heed the devil hath not got thee on a pinacle, and he will not leave till he hath thrown thee down headlong into hell: Oh then take heed of ſelf-conceit, of boaſting in thy own parts, of leaning to thy underſtanding. There is more hope of the prophaneſt beaſt and moſt ungodly wretch that is, then of ſuch an one. Such the Phariſees were, and very few of them ever got any ſpiritual good by Chriſt.</p>

                     <hi>and his own ſafety and advantages, are of his privy counſel.</hi> Thus becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> perſwaded Chriſt to avoid the croſſe, Chriſt ſharply reproved him, telling him, <hi>He ſavoured not the things of God, but of men,</hi> Mat. 16. 23. <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks as a wiſe man, but not as a godly Chriſtian. <hi>Paul</hi> denied this crafty wiſdom, when he would not conſult with fleſh and bloud: And <hi>David</hi> when he made the word of God his counſellour: Our Saviour in many directions would break down this wiſdom after the fleſh, as when he ſaid, <hi>What will it profit a man to win the whole world and loſe his own ſoul?</hi> And <hi>He that will ſave his life will loſe it.</hi> Here you ſee that he dehorts from this wiſdome, becauſe it is indeed folly, and it will prove the greateſt undoing of a man: So our Saviour at another time tels them, His Diſciple muſt deny himſelf, muſt take up his croſſe, muſt look for nothing of comfort or advantage in this life, <hi>That the ſervant cannot expect to be above the Maſter:</hi> Now the very Birds of the Air, and beaſts of the field had better proviſion then he had; What harſh Doctrine then is this to wiſdom after the fleſh? Will they be perſwaded to cut off their right-hand, to pull out their right-eyes? No, they are wiſer then ſo: Oh then take heed of this divel in thee! for ſo our Saviour called that carnal wiſdom in <hi>Peter,</hi> run from it, as <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> did from his Miſtreſſe: Say of it, as <hi>Jacob</hi> of his wicked ſons, <hi>Oh my ſoul, enter not in this counſel!</hi> Bid carnal wiſdom be gone before thou wilt conſider what God requireth of thee.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <hi>Wiſe men after the fleſh they will chooſe ſinne rather then affliction:</hi>

They will chooſe ſin ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</note> Whereas the Scripture makes the evil of ſinne infinitely greater then any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward evil; carnal wiſdom aſſerts the clean contrary. Oh beloved, we ſhould fear nothing but ſinne! not to be outwardly miſerable and undone, but to ſin, we ſhould cry out with <hi>Joſeph, How can we do ſuch things and ſinne againſt God?</hi> We ſhould pray, Lord, Whatſoever thou wilt keep me from, keep me from ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: But alas, ſinne is but a mock, a nothing to a carnal wiſe man. Tell him of

provoking God, of ſinning againſt his conſcience, of eternal damning in hell. He makes but a bold deriſion of ſuch things. Oh the patience of God that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth not the thunderbolts of his vengeance to ſtrike ſuch immediately into hell: Oh then take heed of this fleſhly wiſdom, whereby thou wilt chooſe to commit a thouſand ſins, rather then loſe the leaſt earthly advantage! This will prove gall and wormwood at the later end. This will roar like a Lion in thy conſcience hereafter. We ſhall one day hear thee cry out with <hi>Judas:</hi> Oh I have ſinned in betraying my ſoul, in betraying my conſcience, in betraying the truth of God, unleſſe Faith and Repentance prevent ſuch wounds and blows!</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>The wiſe man after the fleſh ſo lives and orders all his affairs, as if God</hi>

                  <p>THis Text hath diſcovered two ſorts of wiſe men, <hi>The wiſe man after the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>The wiſe man after the fleſh;</hi> as alſo, Gods determination about the later, which is full of admiration and terror. He hath not <hi>cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen many wiſe men after the fleſh.</hi> The characters of carnal wiſe men, you heard the laſt day. I ſhall conclude the firſt ſubject here enumerated at this time, and that which remaineth to be conſidered in the firſt place is, What are the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why God paſſeth by this humane wiſdom, and makes no account of it, Would it not have made much for the honour of the Goſpel? Would it not have been a greater credit and ornament to Religion, to ſee all the great wiſe men of the world, to have done like the wiſe men of the Eaſt that came to adore Chriſt, though lying in a ſtable? Is not this Hiſtory famous, that wiſe men ſhould come ſo farre, and bring their external oblations, and teſtimonies of high reſpect to Chriſt, in that mean and contemptible way, and that in danger of their lives by <hi>Herod?</hi> In outward judgement theſe might have been called, The fools of the Eaſt, rather then the wiſe men. This did wonderfully celebrate the name of Chriſt; and may not a man ſay, If God would thus affect all the wiſe men in the world, would not godlineſſe and religion be freed from thoſe blemiſhes and ſcandals that have been and ſtill are upon it? They are the ſimple and more fooliſh ſort of people, that ſet themſelves to the power of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: None of the ſubtil profound and wiſe men of the world will venture too farre this way. This I confeſſe is a very plauſible pretence, and might have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived many, did not one example of our Saviour wonderfully confound ſuch objections, where you may ſee him wonderfully affected with this divine diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, his heart is greatly moved with it; <hi>I thank thee, O Father, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe, and haſt revealed them to babes,</hi> Mat. 11. 25. The Text ſaith, he made this confeſſion in a publike and ſolemn manner by way of thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving unto God. So then, if this riddle of Gods diſpenſation be unfolded by Scripture-direction, we ſhall ſee matter of great praiſe and joy, not muttering or repining at Gods providence. And in this way of God there may be reaſon on Gods part, why he rejects ſuch; and reaſons on the carnal wiſe mans part, why he is refuſed.</p>

                     <pb n="617" facs="tcp:30767:335"/>
And for the firſt, <hi>One eminent and viſible reaſon, why God lets not the deſtroying</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                     <hi>Sword, as to the Iſraelite, but the Scepter of Grace paſſe over this wiſe man, is to teach us that humane wiſdom hath no merit or cauſality, yea hath no diſpoſition or preparation to the enjoyment of Chriſt.</hi> For when we ſee God ſo ordering it, That not many wiſe, not many prudent and ſubtil men are advanced to this crown of glory, all the world ſeeth it, That it is not humane wiſdom or prudence, but the meer grace of God that makes the difference. The Apoſtle doth often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thoſe that were converted, That it was not for any works they had done, but by grace onely: So then, God who aimeth at his glory in all things, that every mouth might be ſtopped, that no man might ſay, I had a better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, I had a quicker inſight then others, therefore God choſe me, he takes ſuch as are Babes and fooliſh comparatively, and beſtows immortality and glory on them. Had the wiſe men of the world been called, then <hi>Achitophel, Whoſe counſels, were as the oracles of God</hi> had not been refuſed. The Heathens many of them gave a large teſtimony of their great wiſdom; yet none of the <hi>Platoes,</hi> the <hi>Ariſtotles,</hi> the <hi>Tullies</hi> of the world did God make uſe of; but <hi>Piſcatoria ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitas,</hi> the mean things of the world were the fitteſt way for God to make his own greatneſſe known; and hence it is that by ſad experience we ſee men of the quickeſt parts, the nimbleſt wits, the moſt conſtant memories, yet to be the furtheſt off from the Kingdom of heaven. Its Gods way, he alone will have the glory, and to him only it doth appertain, and therefore he takes not thoſe who may plead any internal worth in themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>God will hereby teach us; that he doth more regard the leaſt degree of a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>true humble and ſaving knowledge of him, then he doth all the humane wiſdom in the world.</hi> That as the Scripture cals that tongue, <hi>Iſa. 50. 4. The tongue of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi> in the Preacher, who is able to ſpeak a word of comfort in due ſeaſon to a contrite broken heart for ſinne; So that man is a wiſe knowing man, who hath the fear of God in his heart, and thereby departs from all evil; and indeed as in beaſts, that is their proper wiſe inſtinct they have; whereby they are able to avoid that which is evil and hurtful to them; ſo in man, that is his proper wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to avoid that which is his greateſt evil. Now the greateſt evil of a man, as a man, is ſinne. For he being made rational and after the image of God, and for that glorious end of eternal happineſſe, that is his proper evil which depriveth him of this, and onely ſin doth that: Oh conſider then thou art wiſe, when thou canſt refuſe all thoſe ſins that do ſo eaſily beſet thee! Thou canſt cry out, as they did of the deadly herb in the pot; This is death, yea this is damnation. Obſerve what is that which makes a man approved of by God, it is not his great wiſdom, his great learning, but a practical knowledge of himſelf and of Chriſt. <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaid concerning the natural knowledge of the heavens in their nature and motions, that a little knowledge that way is greater then much knowledge of the ſublunary things, but certainly the practical knowledge of heavenly things is farre more neceſſary then the ſpeculative knowledge of all Arts and Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. <hi>Let him that glorieth glory in this, that he knoweth God.</hi> Do not then boaſt thy ſelf either of outward greatneſſe or inward excellencies of the minde, for thou art not to be compared to the meaneſt perſon in the world, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible ſoever, that doth in a ſaving manner know God: <hi>This is eternal life to know God,</hi> Joh. 17. 3. You cannot ſay, wiſdom, honour, riches are eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life.</p>
                  <p>Well, as theſe may be reaſons on Gods part, ſo if you conſider the earthly wiſe <note place="margin">Reaſons on mans part.</note> man, <hi>There is more hope of a fool then of him;</hi> His wiſdom is like a Sword in a mad mans hand, his wiſdom is the continual offenſive weapon that he lifts up againſt God.

Now, ſaith our Saviour, <hi>If a mans eye be dark, the whole body is darkneſſe,</hi> Mat. 6. 23. Were it not then that thou art ſo wounded in thy minde, that it is ſo fleſhly and ſo corrupt, there were greater hopes of thy Salvation. So then, how neceſſarily muſt this wiſe man periſh, whoſe whole wiſdom and underſtanding is only to damn himſelf! His wiſdom is againſt God, all his arguments, all his reaſonings they are againſt his own ſoul, againſt that way of godlineſſe, in which onely he can be happy. <hi>Aquinas</hi> obſerveth, That faith is more difficult in a learned man then in another that is more ignorant, becauſe the learned man knoweth more objections againſt the truth, is able to raiſe ſuch arguments, he doth not wel know to ſolve again; and this is much more true in a carnal wiſe man: Oh the many cavils, froward objections, ſubtil reaſonings that he hath to put off the commands of God! This right eye then muſt be pulled out ere thou wilt walk in Gods way.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>No marvel if God refuſe ſuch, for they are his greateſt enemies.</hi> They oppoſe his <note place="margin">2.</note> glory, the kingdom of Chriſt, &amp; his people; and howſoever God indeed doth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>lead Captivity captive, and triumph over his enemies,</hi> by changing their hearts; yet there are others whom he doth oppoſe, and cruſheth into pieces; and thus commonly God doth with wiſe men of the world, <hi>The Lord knoweth that their thoughts are but vain: He catcheth the crafty in their own thoughts: He will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the wiſdom of the wiſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. So then no wonder if God paſſe by ſuch men, for there are no greater enemies in the world to him then ſuch. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. giveth three properties of this carnal wiſdom, <hi>Its earthly ſenſual, devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh,</hi> It hath all the wickednes of men and devils in it. Its earthly, that is, wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to get all earthly advantages, whatſoever is profitable and great in this world, that this wiſdom reacheth after. Then its ſenſual, deſtitute of the Spirit of God, as <hi>Jude</hi> argues it, being wholly fixed upon the luſts and pleaſures of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Its deviliſh;</hi> as godly wiſdom is a beam of the divine Light; ſo this carnal wiſdom is part of that deviliſh wiſdom that is in the Devil. The Devil he <note place="margin">3.</note> is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> becauſe of his knowledge. So that you ſee, the more knowledge, the more underſtanding a man hath, if not ſanctified, the more deviliſh he is, the nearer he comes to a devil. So that as the devil is called the <hi>red Dragon</hi> for his ſubtilty and cruelty againſt the ſheep of Chriſt, Thus you have many car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal wiſe men, Dragons rather then men; So violent and bitter are they againſt all the wayes of holineſſe.</p>
                  <p>In the next place let us conſider an Objection, for this Doubt may ariſe, <hi>If God reject wiſe men after the fleſh, Doth not this condemn all humane wiſdom?</hi> How <note place="margin">Object.</note> can any man in any prudent and diſcreet way manage his affairs, eſpecially in evil and dangerous dayes, if no prudence be allowed? Yea doth not our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, though he command all ſpiritual fortitude and courage, all ſelf-denial and readineſſe to take up the croſle, all integrity of aims and ends, yet withall he bids us, <hi>Be wiſe as Serpents,</hi> Mat. 10. 16. and commands us to beware of men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 7. Did not Chriſt himſelf when his adverſaries came with captious que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, as in that about paying tribute to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> Mat. 22. wiſely prevent their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring of him; and ſo <hi>Paul,</hi> though as ready to lay down his life for Chriſt, as men are their cloaths when they go to reſt, yet in thoſe troubles he had about his enemies, he diſcovered much civil prudence, did by his wiſe carriage put his adverſaries to it, that they were often fruſtrated, and <hi>Paul</hi> both kept his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, and yet ſaved himſelf.</p>
                  <p>To anſwer this, It cannot be denied but that diſcretion and civil prudence is <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> an excellent gift of God; and to have zeal but not knowledge and wiſdom is to have ſtrong legs, or body, as <hi>Samſon</hi> had, but no eyes. The men of <hi>Iſſachar</hi> had this great commendation, <hi>That they were wiſe men, and knew the times and ſeaſons, and what was fit to be done.</hi> And certainly prudence (though there be a danger of it, leſt it ſhould degenerate into craft and carnal policy) yet of it ſelf it is an excellent grace and ornament to Religion; It preſerveth godlineſſe from that

                  <p>And the firſt palpable difference is this, <hi>Lawful prudence is alwayes accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with integrity and innocency; but carnal policy hath hypocriſie, guile and guilt with it.</hi> Let a man be as wiſe as he can be, only let him commit no ſinne, let him not play the hypocrite, let him not violate his conſcience. Thus our Saviour giveth that excellent rule, <hi>Be wiſe as Serpents, be innocent as Doves,</hi> Mat. 10. 16. If thou haſt much of the Serpent in thee, but none of the Dove, thou haſt none of this commendable wiſdom; Let not the Serpent eat up the Dove: Oh but where is this happy bounding of prudence and integrity! Many men have not only the prudence of the Serpent, but the poiſon of the Serpent alſo. Never then think that is any lawful wiſdom which runneth thee into a ſin. Its as if a man to prevent a diſeaſe ſhould eat a great deal of poiſon. The loſing of thy integrity, thy innocency or peace of conſcience, is a greater folly then any acts of thy pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence will commend thee for wiſdom. So farre therefore as prudence can finde out a way to eſcape, and yet keep integrity, this man doth hit the mark, and is like thoſe skilful <hi>Benjamites</hi> that could ſhoot to hit a very hair.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Lawful true prudence hath for its end the glory of God, the promoting of his</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>truth, the advancing of Christ; but now fleſhly wiſdom hath no other end, but ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſervation, ſelf-advancing.</hi> We read of <hi>Paul,</hi> who did ſo wiſely carry himſelf that he could without any ſin or hypocriſie become all things to all men; But what was his great end? it was to gain ſome: It was not to make his advantages of them, but Chriſts. And thus in another place he ſaith, <hi>He had caught them by guile,</hi> 2 Cor. 12. 16. But how? Not for himſelf but for Chriſt. So that all the prudence <hi>Paul</hi> uſed in the preaching of the Miniſtery to preſerve his liberty, and to ſave his own life, was only to further the Goſpel, and to propagate the truths of Chriſt, That the Church of God might receive no detriment, thy ends will abundantly diſtinguiſh what kinde of wiſdom it is thou haſt. If a carnal earthly wiſdom, thou mattereſt not Gods glory, not his truth, not his worſhip, but thy own ſafety; whereas godly prudence regards this moſt, and ſaith of the truth of God and his glory, as they did to <hi>David, Thou art better then ten thouſand of us, thou ſhalt not go into danger;</hi> and by this it appeareth, that only a godly man is wiſe, for he only can propound ſuch divine and publick ends to himſelf.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Carnal wiſdom is only the ability and enlarging of the intellective parts of a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>man.</hi> His judgement, his invention, his memory; but then for the heart, the will and affections, they remain wholly in ſin, ſo that ſuch men have no inclination, no delight in any thing but what is evil. But now godly prudence is accompanied with the ſanctification of the heart and affections, they are made obedient and flexible to God, they are ſet upon no earthly thing beyond the bounds God hath preſcribed, and this is a main difference; for according to ſome Philoſophers opinion, and the Scripture ſeemeth to incline that way, The heart is the ſeat of all wiſdom, <hi>Cor ſapit, pulmo loquitur,</hi> is the old ſaying. So that if the heart be carnal and polluted, then the wiſdom thereof is ſo; and commonly the corrupt will and affections bribe and defile the underſtanding; ſo that we may ſay in fleſhly wiſdom the heart and affections they are corrupted, and then they corrupt the underſtanding, that whereas the underſtanding ſhould go before them, they go before the underſtanding, and it is with ſuch a man, as <hi>Copernicus</hi> ſaith it is in the great world, the earth moveth, and the Sun ſtands ſtill, ſo their earthly affections they move, they work, they do all, and their reaſon or wiſdom ſtands ſtill, not directing at all; but godly prudence that ſanctifieth a mans will and affections, it beginneth in the head, and ſo deſcends to the heart, I pray God ye be ſanctified in ſpirit, ſoul and body; It beginneth firſt in that which is moſt
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:30767:337"/>
ſublime and intellectual in a man. So then fleſhly wiſdom is like a Glow-worm upon a dunghil, there is ſome luſtre, but on a noiſom dunghil; they have parts, abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, but like a jewel in a Swines ſnout; whereas this wiſdom is ſaid to be <hi>firſt pure,</hi> Jam. 3. 17. and then follow the other properties, its <hi>firſt pure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>This godly prudence, as its very active in doing, ſo its as patient and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>in ſuffering</hi> Holy prudence walketh by lawful rules to avoid danger; but if God will exerciſe them, then its as wiſe to bear them with the flouriſhing exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of all graces. Now fleſhly wiſdom is ſubtil to eſcape miſeries, but if fallen into them, then toileth and vexeth a man like a wilde bull in a net. He hath no skill, no underſtanding to lay himſelf low before God: Now wiſdom is as much, if not more ſeen in ſuffering then in doing. Therefore <hi>Jam</hi> 1. ſpeaking of the afflictions Gods people would be plunged into, he addeth, <hi>If any man lack wiſdom, let him ask it of God,</hi> that is, wiſdom to bear afflictions, <hi>to account it all joy when they are beſet with them.</hi> Howſoever Chriſt hath commanded his Diſciples prudence, <hi>that they may eſcape all dangers,</hi> yet he hath withall told them, That all their wiſdom, and all their godlineſſe ſhall not preſerve them from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, but they muſt go many of them at leaſt through the red Sea of their own bloud into the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> now when all this doth befall them, they take it thankfully, they <hi>rejoyce they are accounted worthy to ſuffer for Chriſt;</hi> they are not weary of Chriſt and his wayes, though they coſt them ſo dear; but now the carnal wiſdom of man, if after all the ſhifts and ſubtil plots he hath uſed, he fall into danger, then he is confounded, then he crieth out, then he roareth and curſeth, and is like the Sea foaming out its froth. And thus for the firſt Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I ſhall a little touch upon another, and that is, Some may think from hence <note place="margin">Object.</note> may be gathered <hi>a very popular Argument againſt humane learning: for if they are not many wiſe men after the fleſh that God takes, then this humane learning is not at all to be regarded; Thoſe that have the wiſdom of the Spirit, they ought to be exalted only.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Briefly to anſwer this, That although humane learning without the Spirit of <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> God, and the power of Sanctification be nothing but a tinkling cymbal, and is the greateſt enemy Chriſt hath, and the onely pillar of the devils kingdom, yet in it ſelf its a neceſſary qualification, eſpecially to thoſe that are in the Miniſtery, and although God choſe fiſhermen, who at firſt were rude and illiterate, yet he afterwards endowed them with the knowledge of the tongues, and miraculous abilities of wiſdom and utterance; and <hi>Paul</hi> had all that kinde of learning the Jews uſed to have, and beſides was converſant in humane Authors, as appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by his quotations out of humane Poets; and <hi>Moſes</hi> he was skilful in the learning of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which was then the onely famous place of learning. Now that learning of it ſelf is a neceſſary qualification to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, appeareth by theſe Arguments;</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The knowledge of the original tongues is a great part of humane learning,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Learning ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in a Miniſter, why 1.</note> yet how neceſſary that is, all the world ſeeth, for without that the Scriptures could not be tranſlated into a known tongue and interpreted. The Bible would have been a ſealed Book; how could men, and women, and children be able to read the Scriptures, had there not been learned men, who by great pains and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy obtained the knowledge of originals?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Its requiſite, becauſe a Miniſter is to divide the Word aright,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> which cannot be without the help of thoſe arts, Logick and Rhetorick, which are properly ſubſervient to that end; for although it be the Spirit of God that helpeth us to the ſenſe of the Scripture in a ſpiritual ſaving way, we are not by our wit able to believe it, to apply it, to conform to it; yet as its a Text conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of words, and a coherence to make up the ſenſe; ſo the inſtrumental way to diſcover that, is by the help of the arts, and therefore thoſe that are unlearned they are ſaid <hi>to wreſt the Scripture,</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 18. to mangle and torture them to their own deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The adverſaries are learned, and every Miniſter ought to be able to gain-ſay</hi>

                  <p>The firſt is, <hi>Earthly Power and Dominion: Eſt natura hominum avida imperii,</hi> ſaid <hi>Tully,</hi> The nature of man being ambitious, is greedy of power; and its <hi>Omnibus affectibus flagrantius,</hi> more hot and burning then any other luſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the heart be ſo ſanctified, as to accompt nothing great but God; Though Hiſtories do abound with the Tragical ends of many, who were in their time great and terrible in power; yet few are of that mans minde, that would not vouchſafe to take up a Crown from the earth, if he ſhould finde it, becauſe of the cares accompanying of it, Every Crown of gold, being alſo a Crown of thorns.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Another admired thing in the world is <hi>Glory and Honor:</hi> For this <note place="margin">2.</note> many Civil, and many Religious attempts have been undertaken: A poor empty reward, yet the Heathens have buſily diſputed, whether this very nothing be not the chiefeſt good.</p>
                  <p>The third thing admired is, <hi>Riches and Wealth: Dives</hi> fared diliciouſly eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">3.</note> day: The Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, how the world bleſſeth ſuch, that heap up to themſelves innumerable riches, even like the ſands of the ſea ſhore: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome ſay, they are called <hi>Divitiae a dividendo,</hi> becauſe they ſo divide and diſtract the heart with tormenting cares; yet they finde nothing but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, There is <hi>Nobility,</hi> which is by blood and birth: This temporal excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency <note place="margin">4. Temporal greatneſs not in it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with godlneſs and ſalvation.</note> is apt to make men ſwel, as being ſtars of the firſt Magnitude. hereby ready to forget, that they are but duſt and aſhes, as other men are. Now the Apoſtle by theſe two words, doth intend all theſe, and if there be any other thing, that hath temporal glory in the world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider, That this temporal greatneſs, is not of it ſelf inconſiſtent
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:30767:338"/>
with godlineſs and ſalvation. <hi>Julian</hi> objected againſt Chriſtians, That the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Chriſtianity, and of Civil Government, were clean oppoſite to one another: No ſuch matter; none of thoſe enumerated excellencies are of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves contrary to godlineſs.</p>
                  <p>Firſt therefore, We read of godly Governors, godly rich men, godly noble <note place="margin">1.</note> men, not onely in the Old Teſtament, for that is very evident, but in the New, as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea, Nicodemus,</hi> the two Centurions, <hi>Paulus</hi> a Proconſul, <hi>Theophilus</hi> a noble man, to whom <hi>Luke</hi> dedicated his Hiſtory, as moſt judge, and <hi>Iohn</hi> writes to the elect Lady: ſo that the Apoſtle doth not ſay, None of theſe, <hi>But not many,</hi> viz, Comparatively to thoſe of the meaner ſort that are called: Indeed, of the twelve Apoſtles, there was not one of them wiſe after the fleſh, or mighty and noble; for that is a Fabulous tradition concerning <hi>Barthol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>mew,</hi> that he was born of Royal blood, and went in his purple and jewels every day; the Evangeliſts imply the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It muſt alſo be confeſſed, <hi>That the outward good things of this life,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>are ſo far from being contradictory to godlineſs, that godlineſs onely hath the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of them:</hi> How often did God promiſe <hi>Iſrael, That if they would diligently keep his Commandments, They ſhould conquer their enemies, One ſhould chaſe a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, They ſhould be the head, and not the tail;</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> in that great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe God made to him, there was not onely promiſed a numerous poſterity, like the ſands of the ſea ſhore; but alſo, that Kings and Princes ſhould come out of his loyns; and thus it holds for other worldly comforts. <hi>Godlineſs hath the promiſe of this life;</hi> and the Apoſtle makes an unanſwerable argument, <hi>If he hath given us Chriſt, how ſhall he not with him give us all things elſe:</hi> Thus we cannot inſtance in any temporal good thing, but in one place or other there is a promiſe made of it to the godly. And if you ſay,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Why then are not the godly poſſeſſed of theſe things? why have not the godly</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> 
                     <hi>all the greatneſs and glory of the world, ſeeing they are heirs to it by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, We muſt not take thoſe promiſes ſingle, but compare them with <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> other Texts, that do alſo tell us of the miſery and trouble that the godly ſhall have: Now theſe places are not contrary one to another, one promiſeth all good, the other doth foretel of much evil; for theſe things are not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood abſolutely, but conditionally: So far as theſe things are furthering of their main good, and are not hindring of their everlaſting welfare, ſo far they are ſure to be made partakers of them; but when they cannot have theſe and Chriſt alſo, when they muſt either loſe theſe or heaven, then no wonder if God, out of his love, give them not thoſe things which prove hurtful unto them. A father will promiſe to give his childe meat and drink, but if his childe fall into a diſeaſe, that theſe things will increaſe his diſeaſe, then out of his love he keeps theſe things from him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When God doth call any of the wiſe men, and great men, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men of the world, <hi>They become eminent inſtruments of his glory;</hi> they are <note place="margin">3.</note> worth ten thouſand of thoſe that are in an inferior way; for they do not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly credit the Goſpel, as the Goſpel doth them, and as they honor God, ſo God honors them; they loſe nothing of their greatneſs, by having goodneſs: but they by their power, by their wealth and intereſt they have in the world, may greatly advance the ways of God. What Reformations did the godly Kings and Magiſtrates bring about in the Kingdom of <hi>Iudah?</hi> How did <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> by his power and greatneſs, ariſe like a Sun, that diſpelled the dark night of Idolatry and Paganiſm? and therefore ſuch are compared to <hi>Nurſing fathers, and nurſing mothers.</hi> Temporal power, when ſanctified for the uſe of the Church, is like the Elm that beareth up the vine: Oh then, its an happy time, when great men, are good men; when men of power, are men of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And thus alſo men of wealth and eſtates, how many ways may they be
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:30767:339"/>
ſerviceable to God, wherein others cannot be? Rich men are the greateſt men in debt, for they owe more duties to God then others; and as ſuch have wherewith to be more inſtrumental to Gods glory then others, ſo by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample they may bring on others. If the chief and great men in a place, do earneſtly ſeek the Kingdom of Heaven, and promote that, this makes all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior perſons to do the ſame: They are like the ſprings, if the ſprings be poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, then all the ſtreams will be, but if they be ſweet, then the ſtreams will be. When <hi>Eliſha</hi> was to cure the bitter waters, he takes ſalt, and throweth it, not into the ſtreams, but into the ſprings, becauſe that was the way to cure the ſtreams: And thus, if the great ones, and chief ones in a Pariſh, if they love God, and good men, and good things, their example will even compel others to do the like; and certainly, you that have more greatneſs and wealth then others, be afraid, leſt you have not other mens ſins to anſwer for; other men have been incouraged to be prophane, becauſe they have either ſeen you ſo, or at leaſt, you have not ſhewed your ſelf an enemy to ſuch ways. Seeing then God takes this way, few rich men, great men, honored men, comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to others; let us conſider,</p>
                  <p>The Reaſons why, as they be either on Gods part, or on their part who are <note place="margin">Reaſons why God leaves great men. On Gods part. 1.</note> refuſed: And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, On Gods part; <hi>Therefore God may reject theſe, to declare his abſolute So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraiguty and Sufficiency;</hi> that he needs no men, that he is God, and able to carry on the great things of his Counſel, without the wiſdom of wiſe men, the ſtrength of great men, the repute of noble men in the world; that is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why great men in Authority, need wiſe men for counſel, and mighty men for execution thereof, becauſe they know not how to do without other mens eyes, and other mens hands; but God, he is the onely great and mighty God, none is his Counſellor, neither doth he need any help: Therefore that God might demonſtrate this Sufficiency and Independency of his nature, he chooſeth thoſe that all the world ſeeth he doth not want; for if God had wanted the gifts, and parts, and power of men, he would have choſen other men: Oh then behold the wiſdom and power of God in calling of men! he calleth the fooliſh, the weak, the nothings of this world, that ſo all may be convinced and ſee, God needs not the creatures, but the creatures him; and no wonder of this, for the world is not enough ſenſible of Gods greatneſſe, its ready to count every thing great but him, to fear every thing but him; but God by this will teach us, that we are but as clay in the hands of the Potter; as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle preſſeth it at large in the Diſcriminating act of God, and therefore will not ſuffer a man to be ſo preſumptuous, as in thoſe things to ſay, <hi>Why doth God ſo?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, God therefore doth not take many great and noble in this world, <note place="margin">2.</note> that ſo men may ſee <hi>the falſeneſs of that poſition and concluſion,</hi> which men do ſo often make to themſelves; <hi>viz. That God giveth them this wealth, this greatneſs, this honor above others, becauſe he loveth them more then others:</hi> This is the ſweet poyſon that many drink down, God hath given me this ſucceſs, this wealth, this proſperity, this outward happineſs; and certainly if God would deſtroy me, he would never have done ſo much for me: God foreſaw ſuch a Self-flattery in the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and therefore he doth again and again bid them take heed of ſo much as thinking in their heart, that they had conquered their enemies, and poſſeſſed themſelves of <hi>Canaan,</hi> for their own righteouſneſſe, as if there were more in them then in others: Nay, thou ſeeſt this Text and the like, may be like the Hand-writing on the wall, to make all thy joynts tremble. Thy greatneſs, thy plenty, thy abundance, is no ſign of Gods gracious and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial love to thee, if while he beſtoweth theſe things on thee, thou mayeſt be one ordained to eternal deſtruction; therefore ſee what the Wiſe man obſerveth, <hi>No man knoweth love or hatred by theſe things,</hi> Eccleſ. 9. 1. We cannot conclude
<pb n="625" facs="tcp:30767:339"/>
of Gods Electing love, or his Reprobating hatred by theſe outward mercies <hi>David</hi> once began to make ſuch concluſions, but he called himſelf a beaſt for it, and ſaid, <hi>Thereby he condemned the generation of the juſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Therefore God may not chooſe many of theſe, becauſe he would not</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>leave thoſe who are externally miſerable and contemptible, in deſpàir and total de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency of minde:</hi> For if God had dealt the contrary, and had not choſen many of the inferior, and the more deſpicable condition in this world, they had then been in a double miſery, miſerable here, and miſerable hereafter: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if you do regard the poor men of this world, that are in extremity, you will finde, God hath choſen few of them neither, none being more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane, atheiſtical, and like bruits then they, but they are of the middle rank that God commonly makes his choice of: And hereby God would teach us, that the meanneſs and lowneſſe of a mans condition, ſhould not be matter of grief and diſcontent to him: Oh how hard is it to rebuke theſe waves and winds of diſcontent, that are apt to riſe up in thee, becauſe God hath not done as much for thee as for others! others they are richer, they have their hearts eaſe and deſire; this is apt to make all on fire within thee: Oh! but what a good temperament may this put thee into, to conſider, that the lower in the world, doth not hinder thee from being the higher with God: Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will receive more of a mean condition, then of a glorious: God doth not judge as the world judgeth: Oh the great alteration that the day of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will make! <hi>Lazarus</hi> received into eternal glory, and <hi>Dives,</hi> who fared deliciouſly, tormented in hell: If then thy poverty, thy meanneſſe, were a ſtop to Salvation, then it were to be lamented; If Election and Salvation were to be had, as the Popes Indulgence, for money; then as <hi>Albertus</hi> ſaith about Purgatory, Its better with a rich man, then a poor man, for he can give e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to redeem his ſoul; but its not ſo, thy cottage may be as near heaven, as a palace.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Another Reaſon why God paſſeth by temporal greatneſs, may be <note place="margin">4.</note> that in the verſe following, <hi>To confound the great and mighty things of the world;</hi> for ſo ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>He hath choſen the weak things, to confound the mighty:</hi> How are wiſe men and great men confounded, when they ſee that their temporal glory and greatneſs cannot do that, which the grace and godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of meaner men doth! Every great man in the world, he thinks to ruffle it out, ſcorneth that thoſe who are inferiors, ſhould compare with him; but O the terrible confuſion that will cover ſuch mens faces, when at the day of judgement God ſhall ſay, Lo, thy wiſdom, thy power, thy great revenues, have not brought thee to that glory and happineſs, which the prayers and tears of meaner men have done. Our Saviour told the Jews, it would be their confuſion, when men ſhould come from far, and ſit down in the Kingdom of heaven, and they themſelves ſhut out: Oh what heart can conceive the rage and madneſs thou wilt be in! when thou ſhalt ſee ſuch neighbors whom thou hatedſt, mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edſt for their ſtrictneſs and forwardneſs in Religion, ſit upon Thrones of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and thou with all thy earthly pomp caſt out! As <hi>Auſtin</hi> cryeth out, by way of bluſhing, <hi>Surgunt indocti &amp; rapiunt caelum, &amp;c.</hi> Illiterate men they riſe and take the Kingdom of heaven by violence, when learned men with all their books and learning are ſhut out: So the meaner ſort of men, they riſe, and by ſtrictneſs, forwardneſs, get the Kingdom of Heaven, when others finde their outward greatneſs, like a milſtone about their neck, preſſing them into the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the ſea.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The laſt Reaſon on Gods part may be, <hi>to make all the rich and great</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>men of the world to walk humbly, with fear and trembling, leſt God give them all the good things they ſhall ever have, in this life onely:</hi> Thy heart is apt to ſwell with pride, when thou conſidereſt thy proſperity, and thy abundance: Oh but it ſhould rather tremble within thee, leſt God put thee off with this onely;</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="626" facs="tcp:30767:340"/>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> told <hi>Dives,</hi> when he begged that <hi>Lazarus</hi> might come and cool his tongue with a drop of water, <hi>Remember thou hadſt thy good things in this life, and Lazarus evil:</hi> So God may ſay to thee, Thou hadſt thy pleaſure, thy eaſe, thy jollity in this life; now thy torments and thy miſeries they begin: There is ſuch a change made between <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> as in <hi>Gideons</hi> fleece, one time that was wet and the floor dry; then the floor was dry and the fleece wet; thus one while <hi>Dives,</hi> he is in proſperity, and <hi>Lazarus</hi> is a begging for crums; and afterwards <hi>Lazarus</hi> he is in glory, and <hi>Dives</hi> is begging for a drop of water. Take heed then, leſt God do, as <hi>Abraham</hi> with <hi>Iſmael,</hi> he gave him many gifts, but the inheritance was beſtowed onely on <hi>Iſaac:</hi> So God, he gives the wealth, greatneſs, and ſuch gifts, but the inheritance of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that he beſtoweth upon others.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, <hi>I ſhall briefly inſtance in the Reaſons on their part who art</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Reaſons on mans part. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>rejected;</hi> And they are evident:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>All earthly greatneſs and advantages, they are apt to fill the heart with pride and loftineſs: Charge the rich, that they be not high-minded,</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 17. Now there is no diſpoſition doth ſo immediately offend God as this; <hi>God reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the proud, but he giveth grace to the humble:</hi> God doth not give grace to proud men; as your high mountains are often barren.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, All theſe earthly advantages, when poſſeſt, <hi>They do take off the heart</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>from God many ways:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, Inordinate affections towards them, make us refuſe God: <hi>Ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon;</hi> the hand full of earth, cannot receive gold, though offered.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is the deceiveableneſs of their pleaſure, they dead the heart to good things; men finde not that ſweetneſs and delight in heavenly things, as otherwiſe they would.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Solicitude and diſtracting cares about them, they make the ſoul full of fears, full of diverſions, they are Tares among the good Corn.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The ſeeming profitableneſs and neceſſity of them: They cannot live, or be without them; and thereupon they venture the loſs of God to enjoy theſe.</p>

                  <p>THis Text though ſhort in words, is vaſt in ſenſe, and hath this ground for its ſpecial obſervation, that our Saviour uſed it twice, <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. 16. And in this place, <hi>Pulchra ſunt bis dicenda.</hi> The firſt word in the front, <hi>For,</hi> ſheweth its connexion with what was precedent, and is a Parable largely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by our Saviour for this end, to ſhew the goodneſſe of God in offering the word of grace to a people, and the different event of this in the hearers, ſome rejecting it, and that with great malice; others receiving it, but not in the full power and efficacy of it, which makes our Saviour infer this dreadful concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that may make our ears to tingle, when we hear it, <hi>Many are called but few choſen.</hi> Think not it was a ſpeech directed onely to the Jews or thoſe that lived in that time. No, its of perpetual truth; and we ſee it daily experimentally confirmed, that of thoſe who are called few are choſen. My intent is to ſpeak of external calling, as I have ſpoken of internal; and this Text will give a good occaſion. Our Saviour delighted to ſpeak Parables, and that was the cuſtom of wiſe men in the Eaſtern parts ſo to do. For theſe have a popular way of tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching by the things of ſenſe, repreſenting heavenly matter to the underſtanding; For by the feaſt here made, deſcribed to be a marriage-feaſt of a Kings Sonne, where all glory and pomp uſeth to be ſhewn, is meant the priviledges and grace of the Goſpel that are tendered daily by the preaching of the Word unto you: ſometimes that eternal bleſſedneſſe and heavenly glory is compared in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles to a great feaſt, made by a chief and mighty man; but here the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priviledges vouchſafed in the Word are thus called; which is plain, becauſe one came to this Feaſt without a wedding garment, and was caſt out; which could not be, if this Feaſt were eternal glory in heaven, for none ſhall be excluded from thence. So then, you ſee to what excellent and choice things the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpel is compared. Sometimes it is called <hi>The Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> ſometimes <hi>The rich Pearl that a man is to ſell all for to obtain,</hi> and here to a great <hi>Marriage Feaſt.</hi> By which reſemblances the Spirit of God would raiſe up our thoughts and hearts, that we ſhould have an high and great eſteem of the Goſpel preached. Now though thus great and admirable, yet ſee the rebellion and diſobedience of the perſons invited; ſome matter it not; ſome make excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; ſome maliciouſly and cruelly handle the meſſengers: If you ask, Why? what is the matter? What is the wrong done to them? Nothing at all. Its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he gives this honour to them, to invite them to a Marriage Feaſt. He doth not come as an oppreſſour to them, requiring their eſtates, and goods, and lives, but he tenders them all comforts and refreſhments; and for this kindneſſe and condeſcention, they do thus ill requite him; but all do not refuſe, for
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:30767:341"/>
there is one who cometh and ſitteth down at the Feaſt, is as confident and bold, as any of the other Gueſts; till the Maſter of the Feaſt come, and expoſtulates with him for the want of a <hi>wedding Garment,</hi> and then he is ſo convinced of his guilt, that preſently he becomes ſpeechleſſe, upon which his Maſter adjudgeth him to eternal torments, where there are <hi>weeping, and wailing, and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> If you ask, Who is meant by ſuch an one? I anſwer, All thoſe who do outwardly accept of the faith of Chriſt, and profeſſe a general obedience to him; but yet in truth, and indeed they do not thorowly and fully walk accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſts rules. As for thoſe who wilfully reject and refuſe Chriſt, not ſo much as owning any thing of him, they were the Jews and others; but then there are a world of people, who out of cuſtom give an external obedience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, and will be judged Chriſtians, but yet retain nothing of the life and power of Chriſtianity; ſuch are all ignorant and prophane perſons, yea and all civil unblameable men in their lives, yet deſtitute of the Spirit of God, and his grace. Therefore howſoever it be hotly diſputed by ſome, What is meant by this wedding Garment? ſome ſaying faith, ſome good and holy works, yet we may conclude, that by it is meant the whole life of a man ordered in a gracious and ſutable manner to the Word of God. It doth not then mean one grace, but the comprehenſion of all. And as it would be an high contempt and ſcorn of a great man, and the company invited to a great feaſt, if a man ſhould not come in decent and fit apparel; So it is an high neglect and diſhonour unto God and his people, for thee to take the name of Chriſt in thy mouth, and to be called by him, to be looked upon as a Chriſtian; and yet to live in any ſuch wayes that Chriſt doth condemn. Our Saviour having laid down the ſinne and puniſhment of ſuch an one, cloſeth up all with this Text, <hi>Many are called but few are choſen.</hi>

                  <p>Before the words are opened, here is one material Queſtion, Why our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <note place="margin">Queſt.</note> makes this inference, <hi>For many are called, and few choſen,</hi> ſeeing in this Parable of thoſe many who came in at the ſecond call, there is one man onely found without a wedding Garment; ſo that the clean contrary might have been aſſerted, <hi>Many are choſen,</hi> and of thoſe who are called few are rejected. But the Anſwer is two-fold,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, This may relate to the former part of the Parable, as well as the later; <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> and then you ſee all thoſe who were invited by the firſt call, did refuſe, and none did anſwer.</p>
                  <p>But in the next place, which is a true Anſwer, by this One man is repreſented a multitude of perſons of the ſame way and tranſgreſſion, it being ordinary in the Scripture by an inſtance of One, to repreſent Many of the ſame kinde; this is neceſſary for the coherence.</p>
                  <p>The words themſelves abſolutely conſidered contain a vouchſafing of a great mercy, but an excluſion of a greater. The great mercy is in theſe words, <hi>Maxy are called,</hi>

The excluſion of a greater mercy is, <hi>But few are choſen;</hi> that is, of thoſe many who have the outward calling, and give a general Obedience to it, there are but few that are elected to eternal life. If then any matter may put you into a ſerious and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt trembling about your condition, this hath cauſe enough to do it.

If it had been ſaid, Few or none of thoſe, who reject the Goſpel of peace, and means of ſalvation, are choſen; it had been no wonder but to ſay thus of thoſe, who have Lord, Lord, Chriſt, Chriſt often in their mouths, Oh hard ſaying!
<pb n="629" facs="tcp:30767:341"/>
Who can bear it? The firſt Doctrine to be raiſed from the words is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That there are many outwardly called, who yet never partake of the power and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Doct.</note> 
                     <hi>of this mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are thoſe who ſit down at Chriſts feaſt, yet for want of a wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are excluded.</p>
                  <p>To conſider this point let us obſerve, What this outward calling is, and the event of it. And becauſe I have already ſhewen, wherein the Nature of the outward calling of God doth conſiſt, I ſhall only take ſo much as is implied in the ſimilitude this Parable doth hold forth; for when we ſee Chriſt himſelf fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with ſuch a ſutable bait as this is, when he that is truth it ſelf doth uſe ſuch expreſſions, Who can but believe? Who can but receive?</p>
                  <p>And firſt in that the word of God calling men to Faith and Repentance, is <note place="margin">1.</note> thus deſcribed under the notion of a great Feaſt, it implieth, <hi>There is in it a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to every ſoul, that is ſpiritually hungry and thirſty. Ho every one that thirſteth,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>let him come and drink,</hi> Joh. 7. 37. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He is the bread that cometh down from heaven,</hi> Joh. 6. 35. He was born in <hi>Bethlehem.</hi> the houſe of bread.</p>
                  <p>Now theſe expreſſions imply two things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That there ought to be in all men an hungring and thirſting after Christ, and the priviledges he offers.</hi> For if you tell a full man of a great feaſt, he matters it not; becauſe ſuch an one loatheth the very honey-comb; but a thirſty man, as you ſee by <hi>Samſon;</hi> or an hungry man, as you ſee by the Lepers, and thoſe that lived in the time of famine in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Oh what would not they do? How did they rejoyce to have one drop, or one crum? <hi>Lazarus</hi> was glad of a crum; and thus it is here: A man full of his own righteouſneſſe, of his own goodneſſe, He loatheth all this preaching, he preferreth his husks before the fatted calf. But now take a man deſtitute of all theſe, and ſenſible of his leanneſſe: Oh how doth his ſoul thirſt and hunger after Chriſt! Thus <hi>Paul</hi> a called one judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all things <hi>dung and droſſe for the knowledge of Chriſt:</hi> All his former privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges he renounceth, and <hi>None but Chriſt, none but Chriſt</hi> doth repleniſh him. Oh while men have their own greatneſſe, their own goodneſſe and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they will never come to this feaſt. <hi>David</hi> likewiſe he ſpeaketh of his hunger and thirſt after God, yea <hi>that his ſoul breaketh for the longing it hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes unto him;</hi> ſuch a diſpoſition is ſuppoſed, when the grace of the Goſpel is compared to a Feaſt.</p>
                  <p>And then in the ſecond place, <hi>It doth ſuppoſe a ſatisfying and filling of the ſoul.</hi> That whereas the wiſeman obſerveth, <hi>That the eye is not ſatisfied with ſeeing;</hi> and <hi>There are four things which never ſay, There is enough;</hi> yet here, he that thirſteth when he drinketh of this water, he never thirſteth more. That is not, as if he did not deſire more grace, and more communion with Chriſt: Yea the more they taſte of this object, the more they long to have, but they never thirſt ſo, as to ſeek out for a better object; They never ſay of God, as the Church of her Idols, <hi>I will go to my former luſts, and my former ſins, for then it was better with me, then ſince I cleaved to Chriſt.</hi> No, with <hi>Peter</hi> in his transfiguration, they ſay, <hi>It is good to be here;</hi> and which <hi>Peter</hi> did not, they know what they ſay. So then in making the grace of God offered to be like a ſumptuous feaſt, it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth, that there is no ſpiritual defect or want in thee, but it ſhall be made up. That grace no more then nature will not ſuffer any <hi>vacuum;</hi> Some Philoſophers ſpeaking how that <hi>Materia appetit omnes formas,</hi> yet ſay that the heavenly matter doth not, becauſe there the excellency of the form doth ſatiate it. This is much more true in the godly heart, wherein God dwels, there it deſireth, to make no more change. Now how great a matter it is to have all thy ſpiritual longings ſatisfied, the godly only know.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>As this phraſe ſuppoſeth ſatisfaction of ſpiritual hunger; ſo it alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>pleaſure and delight.</hi> A feaſt is matter of joy and comfort. Hence a good
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:30767:342"/>
conſcience is called <hi>a continual feaſt,</hi> Prov. 15. 15. And the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the precious promiſes and excellencies under the Goſpel, he cals them <hi>A feaſt of fat things,</hi> Iſa. 25. 6. <hi>At thy right hand,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>are pleaſures for evermore;</hi> Chriſt is ſaid <hi>To knock at the door</hi> (the outward Call here ſpoken of) <hi>and if any admit him, he will come in and ſup with him,</hi> Revel. 3. 20. So then you ſee, to be called to the graces and duties of the Goſpel, is matter of great joy and comfort; Inſomuch that the kingdom of Heaven is ſaid to be in <hi>righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſnes, peace and joy in the holy Ghost,</hi> yea its called <hi>unſpeakable joy and full of glory.</hi> Oh then how great is the madneſſe and folly of all Recuſants to this gracious of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer! You are prejudiced againſt godlineſſe, as if it brought nothing but melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and deſpair, as if it would be rottenneſſe to the bones, and like the worm to the tree that conſumes the very entrails of it. No, its to be called to a feaſt, to matter of joy and heavenly pleaſure; certainly did the jolly worldling and merry voluptuous man, conſider theſe things, how would he defie and with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation renounce all his former pleaſures? he would call them <hi>miſerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forters,</hi> and ſay, Though they were honey in the mouth, yet they were gravel in the belly. Go to the world, or to thy luſts, What is the feaſt they call thee to? What are the pleaſures they invite thee to? Are they not like that herb which puts a man into a laughter, but kils him therewith? Seeing then that <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta non eſt vivere, ſed valere,</hi> To live is not meerly to live, but to be healthful and chearful, and comfortable: Oh know this can never be, till thou art parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of this Feaſt. What though you ſee ungodly men jolly and merry, having their hearts eaſe, and nothing troubles them, this is but a blaze? the crackling of thorns; Its but <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Gourd that gives him ſome refreſhment for a ſeaſon. This is but ſweet poiſon, the ſtings and torments will be the greater. The poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt godly man, that hath no raiment for covering, no food to expel hunger, may yet ſit down at this Feaſt with Chriſt every day. And there is no evil eye to grudge; but in the <hi>Canticles</hi> the Spouſe bids them <hi>Drink, yea drink abundantly, Cant.</hi> 5. 1. And if the godly at any time are dejected, go bowed down, have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but gall to eat, and vinegar to drink, without any comfort, any joy; Its their own fault, their own imperfection. They drink not of this good wine, they feed not on theſe fat things by faith; and therefore let the godly conſider, that its their duty to walk with joy and chearfulneſſe; All the while thou walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in diffidence and dejections, thou goeſt without a wedding garment, thou art not in a ſutable poſture to a marriage-feaſt. Thy praying, thy hearing is without a wedding garment, thy mourning diſparageth the feaſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Here is by this phraſe implied, <hi>The great glory and honour that God would put on all thoſe whom he cals.</hi> He makes thee his choice friend, and gives thee this token of friendſhip; <hi>David</hi> expreſſing a friend, ſaid, <hi>We ate bread toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Haman,</hi> how did he boaſt when the King made a great feaſt for the Queen, <hi>And I am invited alſo,</hi> ſaith <hi>Haman.</hi> And certainly we cannot be capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of greater honour, then to be called to this communion and fellowſhip with God, yea to this familiarity; hence all the faithful, as <hi>Abraham,</hi> are called <hi>Gods friends;</hi> Now were faith alive in mens breſts, they would never refuſe Gods calling, for is it not from ſlavery and bondage to an heavenly freedom? Is it not from communion with the devil in his works of darkneſſe, to ſociety with God and his Angels?</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee how eminently this Parable ſets forth the priviledges of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel in the tender thereof, you would wonder any in the world ſhould refuſe, that all did not come in by an holy violence: yet in the next place, ſee the ſad <note place="margin">Many called ones reject the Goſpel-feaſt. 1.</note> event, how ill this love is requited: For</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>There are many perſons thus outwardly called, that are prophane Atheiſts, believe none of theſe things.</hi> All theſe Parables of our Saviour, and all theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent reſemblances, they make but notions and phantaſies. <hi>David</hi> complained of this, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4. when he exhorted men <hi>to ſerve the Lord, and to offer unto him
<pb n="631" facs="tcp:30767:342"/>
the ſacrifice of thanksgiving;</hi> he addeth, <hi>Many ſay, Who will ſhew us any good?</hi> They counted nothing of that <hi>David</hi> mentioned, to be ſuch a great good that men ſhould run after it. This made the Prophet complain, <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> Oh it is thy atheiſm, thy unbelief that makes thee not preſently anſwer Gods call. Otherwiſe thou wouldſt cry out with the Church, <hi>Draw us and we will run after thee;</hi> For want of a divine faith comes all that rebellion and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience which is; well therefore is the ſame word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> rendered unbelief and diſobedience.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>There are the ſottiſh and ſtupid worldlings who have the Serpents curſe</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>on them, to feed only on the duſt of the earth.</hi> Theſe make no matter of this graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous invitation; ſo in this Parable, and in another to this purpoſe, it is ſaid, <hi>When they were called, that they had bought their fields and their oxen,</hi> Luk. 14. 19. and ſo they went to ſee their earthly poſſeſſions; and thus tho Phariſees, who were covetous, are ſaid <hi>To deride Chriſt,</hi> Luk. 16. 14. As the earth of all ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is the heavieſt, and inclineth to the centre; ſo theſe who minde earthly things have their thoughts and affections furtheſt off from God, and his calling. Theſe earthly affections do at firſt reſiſt the very entrance of good affections, and if yet they be received, then they quickly choak them: Never is the Goſpel more likely to fall like water ſpilt upon the ground, then when it meets with an earthy worldly heart: Oh he can finde no ſavour, no ſweetneſſe in approaches to God! <hi>When will the Sabbath and the new moon be over,</hi> ſay they in the Prophet, <hi>that we may buy and ſell again?</hi> Amos 8. 5.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There are an higher degree of wicked men, who do not only neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and ſlight this call of God, <hi>But they do wickedly and cruelly abuſe and perſecute</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>the very meſſengers that come to invite them.</hi> As here in this Parable, when they were called to the feaſt, They took the Meſſengers, and ſome they mocked, and ſome they killed: Oh barbarous wickedneſſe! What is the hurt that is done to them? They are invited to a feaſt, and for this they ſtone the Meſſengers. Thus the Prophets in all ages have been entertained: <hi>Oh Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtonest them that are ſent to thee!</hi> Mat. 23. 37. Yea Chriſt the Son and Heir, he was put to death for inviting them to this feaſt: and was this wickedneſs only in the former times? Is there not that venom and enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in many mens hearts? What hurt do the Miniſters of God unto thee? Becauſe they would reclaim thee from thy wickedneſs, ſave thee from thy luſts; this makes thee imbittered againſt them; forgive them this wrong.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>There are thoſe who do not refuſe, but come in upon invitation.</hi> They ſit <note place="margin">4.</note> down at the feaſt, none findes fault with them; The meſſengers they admit him, the fellow-gueſts they eat with him, <hi>Only the Lord, he ſpieth him without a wedding garment:</hi> Now by ſuch an one is meant all thoſe who have an external profeſſion of Chriſt, and ſo enjoy all the outward priviledges in the Church, none may prohibit them; yet for all that are without a wedding garment, and at laſt to be caſt out. And this is properly the perſon externally called that I intend to treat on: As for the other, they are only called on Gods part, there is no manner of conſent on their part.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe of Inſtruction.</hi> How inexcuſable all they will be, who refuſe God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> Is it not to a feaſt, to matter of ſatisfaction, delight, plenty and honour? Why then doſt thou reject this Call? Go at the day of Judgement, and ſay, O Lord, it is true, I was invited, I was convinced, I ſaw it was better to obey then not; but my preſent luſts, my preſent pleaſures, they drew me aſide: ſay unto God, unto Chriſt, unto Angels, I know you were better company, more glory and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe there was with you, yet I forſake you to be tormented with the Devil and his Angels to all eternity.</p>

                  <p>THe perſons called by God, who yet are not choſen, are of two ſorts, as you heard:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Thoſe, who, though ſo graciouſly invited, do yet obſtinately and peremptorily refuſe, and theſe are actively onely called on Gods part.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſort is of thoſe who do give conſent, and yeild to their call, but becauſe they do not riſe up fully to all that is required, therefore they are caſt away. In this rank is the man, who being invited, made no oppoſition or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, but went in, and ſate down at the feaſt, was as confident as the other gueſts, ſeemeth to be conſcious to himſelf of no fault, but having no wedding garment, the maſter is ſo wroth and diſpleaſed with him, that he is adjudged to everlaſting torments; and from this inſtance our Saviour gathers this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion in the Text; ſo that the meaning is, Of thoſe many that are called, and give a general acceptance of it, yet few are choſen to eternal glory: Thoſe enjoy the feaſt of the Ordinances here, who are to be tormented for ever here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; thoſe are admitted to eat in Gods preſence here, who ſhall be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to depart from him hereafter, he knoweth them not: Many are admitted into the Temple, that may not enter into the holieſt of holies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That many of thoſe who are called, and in many things obey, do yet come ſhort</hi>

                     <hi>in that which is abſolutely neceſſary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that comes to the feaſt, was not guilty of ſuch rebellion, as they that oppoſed, and inhumanely handled the Meſſengers; yet becauſe he did not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Wedding-Garment, which is a converſation and life ſutable to the outward profeſſion of Chriſt, therefore he is caſt away: This is a neceſſary truth; for though we have many Chriſtians, yet we have indeed but few: Though all in the Land come and ſit down at the feaſt, yet we may ſay to many, <hi>Friends, how came ye in here?</hi> How came you to profeſs Chriſt? how came you to ſay you are Chriſtians? What? ſuch a ſinner, ſuch an ungodly perſon, and yet ſay, You believe in Chriſt, you love Chriſt? What is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Chriſtian profeſſion this day, but the ungodly, ignorant, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane lives of thoſe who are baptized into Chriſts name? Monſters they are, and not Chriſtians, who in one part bear the image of Chriſt, and in another the image of the Devil; in one part ſeem to be men, in another beaſts: So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Chriſtian Religion may boaſt in the multitude of her followers, yet it may bluſh at the lives of them: This was a point our Saviour did much
<pb n="633" facs="tcp:30767:343"/>
treat upon, That men did receive the truth, as to ſome particulars, and ſome degrees, butnot wholly and throughly. The Parables of the ſeveral ſorts of ground, of the unwiſe builder, eſpecially that of the fooliſh Virgins, who were Virgins, had their lamps, went out to meet the Bridegroom, onely they wanted oyl, and this was not perceived till it was too late; all theſe tend to this purpoſe: You ſee then beloved, that we may have our lamps lighted, we may have the external profeſſion and acknowledgement of Chriſt, but want oyl in time of need. Certainly, while we are preaching of this ſubject, we may ſay almoſt to every man, <hi>Nunc tua res agitur,</hi> rouſe up thy ſelf and attend, for this matter belongs to thee: Thou receiveſt Chriſt and his ways but in parcels, though thou haſt Baptiſm, the title of a Chriſtian, ſitteſt down at the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; yet where is the Wedding-garment! where is the converſation that doth agree, and belong to ſo holy a matter?</p>
                  <p>To open this Doctrine, let us conſider,</p>

                  <p>Now this external ſubmiſſion, lieth in theſe things:</p>

To come to Chriſt, is not the work of the tongue, or of the head, but mainly and principally of the heart: With the mouth man is ſaid to make confeſſion, but with the heart he is alſo ſaid to believe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. Now if you obſerve the general deportment of thoſe who are thus called, can you ſee any more in them, then a meer bare and general conſent to be accounted as a Chriſtian? Do they matter any more? Do they ever think, What? is this all Chriſt would have me to do? No, but they ſit down with this general acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement: Thus <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> he came to the feaſt without a Wedding gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; though the Text ſaith, <hi>He believed, and was baptized,</hi> yet he was in the ſtate of gall and bitterneſs, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. 17. it is true, he did not feel this bitterneſs, he thought all was well, but it was ſo much the more dangerous: Thus it is here, thou believeſt, thou art baptized, thou prayeſt, thou profeſſeſt Chriſt with the mouth, and yet thy ſoul may be in gall and wormwood, a great gulf may be between thee and ſalvation, and thou all this while lie down in peace and ſecurity of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Upon this entering themſelves into the number of Chriſts flock, they may be fully, but fooliſhly perſwaded, that now they have done all:</hi> That this will <note place="margin">2.</note> intereſt them into heavenly glory: Oh what a bewitching is this! and are not moſt men ſurprized by this? they think this believing in God and Chriſt, this external and viſible profeſſion, will inſtate them in all happineſs. The Jews of old did deſperately miſcarry upon this point, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Lord,</hi> Jer. 7. this made them bold and confident; and in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſee how induſtrious <hi>James</hi> is, to ſhew the vanity of that faith, <hi>Iames</hi> 3. which is titularly faith, and not effectual in godlineſs. They that cryed, <hi>Lord, Lord,</hi> and had propheſied, and wrought miracles in Chriſts name, are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to depart into eternal fire, becauſe they were workers of iniquity. Many times the Apoſtle bids them not be deceived, <hi>Neither fornicators or extortioners, &amp;c. ſhould inherit the Kingdom of heaven,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 9. <hi>Be not deceived,</hi> ſaith he: We are very apt to think, that a profeſſion, or bare duties, will carry us to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
<pb n="634" facs="tcp:30767:344"/>
without this power of godlineſs: And if the Apoſtle ſpeaketh but of the tongue onely, <hi>Iames 1. 26. If any man ſeem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, that mans Religion is in vain:</hi> How much rather, if he do not morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie his ſin, and refrain from all other groſs impieties? when will people drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſin, recover out of it? Awake thou that ſleepeſt in this ſtupidity: What is Baptiſm? what is Chriſtianity? what is Proteſtantiſm, but a meer empty ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow and title, if thy life be polluted with impieties: As the Heathens called their Idols gods, when yet they had no Deity in them, being images of wood, <hi>Having eyes, and ſee not; ears, and hear not; feet, and walk not:</hi> Thus are ſuch Idol Chriſtians, Idol Believers. <hi>There are</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>many called gods in the world, but we know that an Idol is nothing:</hi> Thus it is here, there are many called Chriſtians, many called Believers, but we know this is nothing, where the life and power of godlineſs is wanting: Truſt not then to thy good faith, to theſe glorious titles, they will deceive thee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>If in the primitive times, among thoſe many that gave up their names</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3. The number of choſen ones very few.</note> 
                     <hi>to Chriſt, few were choſen, how much a leſs number muſt there be now of choſen ones:</hi> This I would have diligently conſidered, If ſo be in thoſe primitive times of thoſe many thouſands that believed in Chriſt, few were choſen, how little a remnant or handful may we expect to be among our called perſons! For there were three Reaſons, why all that were then called ſhould be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen: For</p>
                  <p>Firſt, To accept of the Faith and Doctrine of Chriſt, was then a meer free and ſpontaneous thing; there was no compulſion by outward power, it was not a Religion they were educated and brought up in, their Parents did not teach them faith in Chriſt: Now who could not think certainly, they are right indeed, they muſt needs have the power of grace in them, who did thus rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and willingly receive a Doctrine that was wholly new to them, their parents did not inſtruct them in, no earthly power did force them to, but out of meer voluntary choice they imbraced it: Yet in that company there was more chaff then wheat, in that garden there were more weeds then flowers: What then may we judge, when as the contrary Reaſons are with us? for the Chriſtian faith we imbrace, is that we have by education, by Cuſtom: Who is there that makes uſe of his own underſtanding, of his own will to imbrace the truths of Chriſt? who is there, that upon ſearching the Scriptures, and trying all things, doth thus adhere to the truth? Are not men bruitiſh in believing, as well as in living? <hi>Malunt homines credere, quam judicare,</hi> They take up that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion their parents taught them, and its a meer hap, wholly accidental to them, that its the truth: Thus, like beaſts, they follow one another, they go <hi>qua itur, non qua eundum est;</hi> certainly, this is far from having the ſpirit of God o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening our hearts, and inlightning our mindes: This is not by underſtanding and judging, and proving all things, to hold faſt that which is good; This is not for a man to live by his faith, but by his Fathers, or Grand-fathers faith; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to be brought up in the true Doctrine of Chriſt, is a wonderful mercy, its an excellent ſeaſoning of the veſſel betimes; but yet if a man have no more from the Chriſtian Doctrine, then his education, he hath no more to ſay for the truth, then the Jews and Turks have for their groſs falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That all were not choſen, who were then called, we may won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, becauſe of the great and wonderful miracles that they enjoyed, which might greatly confirm their faith; for who could be but perſwaded that Chriſt was the Meſſiah, when he ſaw the dead raiſed from the grave, the blinde made to ſee, the deaf to hear, and the glorious things of God, ſhewing themſelves thereby? and to theſe great miracles, we may adde the zeal and remarkable godlineſs of thoſe who lived in the former times; Alas! no compariſon may be made of the grace and godlineſs that now is, with what hath been formerly:
<pb n="635" facs="tcp:30767:344"/>
Now then, if thoſe that were called in thoſe days, had all thoſe great incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the power and life of godlineſs, and yet were defective; What may we look for, when thoſe are not enjoyed?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This may make us wonder that few onely were choſen, of thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">3.</note> called in former times, becauſe there was little or no outward incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto the way of Chriſt: There could be little ſatisfaction given to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal expectations. How often doth our Saviour call upon them for ſelf denyal? foretel of the trouble and hatred they ſhall meet with in the world? and when men have proffered their obedience to him, he tells them of the little worldly incouragements they muſt look for. Now it may be a wonder, that men, who had not the deep impreſſion of godlineſs upon their hearts, ſhould ever ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture upon ſuch profeſſion, where there were no earthly baits. We uſe to ſay, That adverſity tryeth a friend; yet here it did not hold: Well then, if many men called in thoſe days, did ſo miſcarry, when yet we would think nothing but pure love did ſet them on work? what little faithfulneſs may be thought to be in the inward parts of thoſe, who have temporal advantages by Chriſt; yea, they would be ſubject to the Magiſtrates puniſhment, if they ſhould renounce the faith of Chriſt: Thus you ſee, how conſiderable a matter it is, that even in our Saviours time, and primitive beginnings of the Church, there ſhould be many called, and few choſen: Oh, if ever, then we ſhould have thought the Church would have been conſtituted of thoſe that were truly godly; if ever, then it would have been altogether fair, and no ſpots in it, but we ſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>That are diligent in the diſcharge of the external duties God requireth, but never look to the internal frame and change of the heart:</hi> That was the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal diſeaſe among the Jews, for burnt-offerings and ſacrifices they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and diligent in; they did even weary God with the abundance of them: but God rejected them all comparatively, <hi>Burnt offering and ſacrifice God would not have, but a broken ſpirit, and the Law of God written in their hearts.</hi> Our Saviour al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo is very earneſt in this point, in acquainting people with this, That the meer outward performance of any Religious duty, without any inward change and work of the ſpirit, is but a ſhell, is but the skin; therefore he tells them, The heart is the good or bad treaſury, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

God is a ſpirit, and he ſeeketh for ſuch who worſhip him in ſpirit and truth:</hi> No wonder then, if you ſee many people ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the external duties of praying and hearing, for theſe are but a bodily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor: Here is no inward working upon their ſoul, they pray not, they hear not with a powerful change upon the inward man: Speak to them of a broken ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, a contrite heart, which is of ſo great repute with God, you ſpeak a meer riddle to them.

Now then conſider, Why doeſt thou retain any parcels of Chriſtianity, and not all:
<pb n="636" facs="tcp:30767:345"/>
Thou believeſt a God, thou believeſt Jeſus Chriſt was God: Why? becauſe the word of God ſaith ſo: Doth not the ſame word ſay, <hi>Swear not at all?</hi> doth not then the ſame word ſay, <hi>Be not drunk with wine?</hi> doth not the ſame word ſay, <hi>Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judge?</hi> This man that was called in the parable, by the ſame reaſon that he purpoſed to go to the feaſt, he ſhould alſo have provided a ſutable garment; he could not but think what a neglect and contempt it would be accounted to do otherwiſe: Oh then, that all who hear this truth, would deeply conſider of it, by what reaſon I obey the call of God in any thing, I ſhould do it in all things; by what ground I will go to pray and hear, I ſhould alſo leave ſuch luſts, and forbear ſuch ſins, either all or none, for all duties have the ſame Divine ſtamp upon them.</p>

The Apoſtle <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 4. reckons up many preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives every Jew had by being a member of that Church; and thus under the New Teſtament, every one externally called, though not inwardly ſanctified, partaketh of many advantages; The promiſe is made to him and his ſeed, he is within the outward adminiſtration of the Covenant, he is accounted of the Church, and the body of Chriſt: Now theſe things people make a great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of; Oh, to be reputed as a publican and an heathen, is an high reproach; ſhould not they be thought Chriſtians, their children to be baptized, they would judge it unſufferable wrong, not conſidering, that though they be thus forward for priviledges, they are negligent about duties: Thou wouldſt have thy childe baptized, thou conſidereſt not, how God would have thee to walk, and what thy duty is about the education of children: Thy wickedneſs, and thy ungodly ways do provoke God, more then all thoſe priviledges will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage thee.</p>

                  <p>Becauſe of this diverſe mixture in mens lives, their plowing with an Ox and Aſs, their ſowing with contrary ſeeds, I ſhall amplifie and urge this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That by the ſame reaſon any man doth receive any thing of Chriſt, he is bound to</hi>

                     <hi>receive all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon what ground thou wilt pray, hear his word preached, thou art bound to caſt away all thy ungodlineſs, to ſet upon the ſtrict and powerful means of holineſs: And O that God would by this truth convince you, how contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry every ill-lived Chriſtian is to his own principles; that he is a ſelf convinced man, that he is the greateſt hypocrite in the world, that God requireth all or none; <hi>that we are to love God with all our heart, all our ſoul, and all our ſtrength;</hi> that there is no taking half of God, or half of Chriſt: To be almoſt a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, is to be almoſt ſaved, and that is to be wholly damned.</p>
                  <p>Before we come to lay down the grounds of this, conſider theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: <note place="margin">Particular rules about this point. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That the imbracing of the Chriſtian faith, and the Laws of Chriſt, are to be an act of the freeſt choice, and voluntary acceptation that can be:</hi> Though cuſtom and education may help and prepare, and much incline, yet till a man come to Chriſt by his own faith, and by his own willing inclination, its not acceptable: <hi>Religio non poteſt cogi: Caeſar non poteſt dare fidem,</hi> was the ſaying of the Ancients; even as it is ſaid of <hi>Moſes, He choſe the afflictions of Chriſt, rather then the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Egypt,</hi> Heb. 11. Thus a Chriſtian, he chooſeth rather the way of Chriſt, though requiring much ſelf-denial, though expoſed to all hatred, rather then any other advantagious way in the world: Now then grant this, That to obey Chriſts call, is an act of meer voluntary choice, then there is no intelligent man, can imbrace any one command of Chriſt, who doth not likewiſe ſubmit to all. Would you then know, how Chriſtianity comes to be thus divided and mingled, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly life, to a godly faith, like a live man, to a dead carkaſs; one main rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe we have this Religion by education, by cuſtom, by the Laws of the Land, if it had been any other, Popery or Judaiſm, it had been all one: It is to the unknown God that moſt build an Altar, and by this means men are not careful to bring up their lives to this Chriſtianity, but bring down that to them; whereas every man that taketh this holy and glorious profeſſion upon him, ſhould wiſely weigh, what is this I have taken upon me? what doth it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire of me? In all other worldly or external callings we conclude, and much more this ſhould be done in this heavenly calling. Our Saviour gives an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent caution herein, making the profeſſion of Chriſtianity, to be like war and building, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 31. which are the two moſt expenſive attempts that can be: Do you not deride that builder, who goeth about to rear a glorious building, and hath nothing to do it withall? Do you not ſay, Where is your money? what will you do it with? will you not proclaim your folly to all the world? So it is here, What? wilt thou be a Chriſtian? wilt thou believe in Chriſt? Why where is thy holineſs, thy purity, thy chaſtity, thy heavenlineſs? I tell thee, to profeſs Chriſt, and yet be a drunkard, a whoremonger, is as great a mocking and ſcorning of Chriſt, as they did who crucified him, that in ſcorn put on him a crown of thorns, and ſaluted him as a King: Oh then, that this truth might ſound as terribly in your ears, as the Archangels trumpet will at the day of Judgement! Its no dallying matter, its no matter of words and comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to come at Gods call: No, let every one that calls on the name of Chriſt depart from iniquity.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Conſider this: we grant, <hi>That even the godlieſt men that are, though they</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>do for the ſubſtance and main, as the ſubſtantial acts of them, do all that God commands, yet they fail in many things, and the degrees of their grace are imperfect:</hi> So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there be the ſame reaſon why they ſhould fulfil all the degrees of grace,
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:30767:346"/>
yet they cannot in this life; and the reaſon is, becauſe God giveth no man ſuch meaſure of grace in this life, as to make him perfect without ſin; there are the ſtubs and reliques of original corruption in the moſt holy, which are an heavy conflict and combate in them: Therefore let not the godly wring this truth till blood come from it, which is intended onely for milk: Say not, There is the ſame reaſon why I ſhould do every thing perfectly, as that I ſhould do any thing at all; for although there be the ſame ground, yet God gives not the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of ſtrength for one, as he doth for another; our perfection is, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our imperfections: The reliques of ſin are ſtill acting in us, that the grace of the Goſpel may be made the more glorious.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>In the matters of Chriſt, ſome are Doctrinal, ſome are practical; and there is the ſame reaſon for the receiving of the one, as well as of the other:</hi> For the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <note place="margin">

Two things Chriſt requireth of you: Firſt, duties of you as men; then duties as a Church, as a Society meeting by order in all viſible worſhip: Now theſe latter duties are not ſo much known, becauſe indeed men have not attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the practice of the former: The ſum of this head is, That in the things of Chriſt, whether Doctrinal or Practical, ſome things are obſcure, and ſome things are evident and plain: Now the meaning of the aſſertion is, That by what ground we receive or do any thing Chriſt hath required, by the ſame reaſon we are to do all the reſt that are of evident and plain knowledge. And I ſhall eſpecially follow this in practicals, <hi>viz.</hi> That what reaſon thou haſt to profeſs a faith in Chriſt, to come to Church, to pray to him; there is the ſame to lay aſide all thy ungodlineſs and prophaneneſs; inſomuch, that it is a wonder, that any man ſhould think he is no good Chriſtian, if he do not come to Church and pray, and doth not alſo ſay, I am no good Chriſtian as long as I lye, ſwear, curſe, live in riotings and drunkenneſs: Oh! how hath ſin and Satan bewitched you, and blinded your eyes, that you ſhould not ſee theſe plain things? this matter ſhould ſo eaſily convince your conſcience, that it needs not much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing; but yet men are more ſenſeleſs then the earth, in Divine and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That of the Apoſtle James is very urgent,</hi> James 2. 11. <hi>viz. The Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Divine command of the Law-giver:</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaketh to him that doth all the Commandments, yet breaks one, that he is guilty of all; as a man that breaks the round of a chain, he doth in effect break the whole chain; And why? becauſe the ſame Authority is deſpiſed in one, as well as in all: He that ſaid, <hi>Believe Chriſt to be God,</hi> ſaid alſo, <hi>No unrighteous or wicked perſon ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of heaven:</hi> If ſo be then, that though Chriſt commanded thee to believe, and to be baptized, he had given thee an indulgence to any luſt or ſin, that thou mightſt commit any iniquity without control, there had been no word of God againſt it, then thou mighteſt have anſwered all well; but now thou muſt needs be ſpeechleſs: Oh then that men would attend to theſe things! We are not now preaching any ſublime myſteries of Religion, we have not a vail upon our matter; even the weakeſt and ignorant may hear and underſtand this: The ſame God that bids me pray, and hear his word, bids me give over my luſts, my drunkenneſs, my ſwearing; now why ſhould I make conſcience of one, and not of the other? why ſhould I do one becauſe God commands it, and not the other?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>There is the ſame neceſſity of one as well as the other:</hi> A man can be no more ſaved, unleſs he part with all theſe ungodly ways, then if he ſhould <note place="margin">2.</note> renounce the Chriſtian faith: It is needleſs to reckon up all thoſe places, which make repentance and a godly life abſolutely neceſſary to eternal happineſs; If then you ſhould ſee a man deny his Chriſtian faith, Renounce Chriſt and his truth, you would then preſently conclude, There is no hope for this man: So it is here, If you ſee a man profeſſing the faith of Chriſt, yet doing the works of the Devil, renouncing all the holy works Chriſt hath commanded, there is no hope of ſuch a man while abiding ſo; and therefore the Scripture calls this <hi>A denying of God,</hi> and <hi>A denying of Chriſt,</hi> Tit. 1. 16. when men in words do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him, but in their practice live contrary to him: Oh I how near doth this truth come many of you? Do not your deeds deny God? do not your luſts, your oathes, unlawful pleaſures deny him? and yet the leaving of theſe is as indiſpenſably neceſſary to ſalvation, as the outward profeſſing of the ways of Chriſt; going to the feaſt with a Wedding-garment, was as neceſſary as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the feaſt at all; and there was no more hope of him that went without it, then thoſe who did utterly refuſe to come unto him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>There is not the ſame reaſon onely, that thou ſhouldſt do all the duties God requireth, as well as externally profeſs him, and call on his name; but alſo, that thou ſhouldſt do them with all accurateneſs, ſtrictneſs, and all diligence:</hi> There is no man that thinks himſelf bound to be a Chriſtian, but he is by the ſame ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to think; he is bound to be an accurate, diligent and ſtrict one; and he that is not a ſtrict, preciſe one, is indeed none, as to have any benefit by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: This I would have you conſider, for men think it indeed their duty to be Chriſtians at large, Proteſtants in a general looſe way, they are contented with this; but if you preſs them to a more exact circumſpect walking, not to be conformed to the World, then this is the ſtrictneſs they cannot abide; What needs all this? cannot we be ſaved without all this nicety? as they call it. Now conſider</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>No, ye cannot be ſaved without this ſtrictneſs:</hi> The way to hell is a broad <note place="margin">1.</note> way, the way to heaven is a ſtrait way, the gate is a narrow gate, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 14. and men muſt ſtrive to enter in, ye are to walk circumſpectly, <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>to God:</hi> In the Old Teſtament, the firſt-fruits, and the fat of the Sacrifices were to be offered: The command is, <hi>To love God with all our heart, all our might, and all our ſtrength;</hi> that as God is <hi>He, quo nihil melius cogitari poteſt,</hi> then whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be thought better; ſo if we have any better affections, any better ſtrength, any better power then other, we ſhould ſpend it wholly in ſervice of God: Thus they cryed, <hi>Hoc age,</hi> in offering their Sacrifices; how then cometh it about, that thou ſhouldſt have this fooliſh perſwaſion, to think thou ſerveſt God, and thou pleaſeſt him, when the world and the Devil have far more of thee then they have? This made <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſay to the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they proffered to ſerve God, <hi>Ye cannot ſerve God, for he is a jealous God,</hi> Joſhua 24. 19. ye cannot ſerve him, unleſs you become other men then you are, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take your ſelves wholly to him.</p>

In Popery, are not they Canonized for Saints, who have in the moſt ſtrict and preciſe way, given up themſelves to their Religion? What then ſhould be the matter, that among us its the clean contrary? If a man walk in the ways of Chriſt more ſtrictly then others, if a man deſire to follow his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders directly, ſo that he doth not either run into the ſame exceſs of ryot, or boundleſs ſuperſtition as others do, ſuch a man is ſcorned, and moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred of all men; yet thus it is, Be no more godly, be no more holy then the cuſtom of the world is, and you ſhall be applauded: but if you go faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then they, will not ſit down with ſuch looſneſs and formality as they do, then they cry out of you: Thus you ſee, that by what reaſon a man takes up any thing of Chriſt, he is bound to receive all; and what he doth, he is bound to do it with that ſtrictneſs and accurateneſs that poſſibly may be. You may ask the queſtion then, How comes it about, that when there is the ſame ground, yet moſt perſons think it enough to come to the Feaſt, though without a Wedding-garment; think it enough to be called, though not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen: And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>They do not ſet Faith, Reaſon and Iudgement on work;</hi> for if they did, <note place="margin">1 Why moſt perſons think it enough to come to the feaſt, though without a wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-garment.</note> this ſun ariſing, would preſently diſpell that darkneſs: If men would take the Pſalmiſts counſel, <hi>To commune with their own hearts, and be ſtill;</hi> To propound theſe Queſtions to their Souls, Why do I take this of Chriſts, and refuſe the other? Why do I own this particular, and neglect the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? The matter would be ſo clear preſently to a mans conſcience, that he would cry out, All or none: As the Apoſtle compareth wicked men to bruit beaſts, becauſe they are led aſide with the preſent pleaſures; ſo they are like to them, becauſe they never reflect upon themſelves, and compare things rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally together. <hi>Be not as the horſe and mule,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32, 9. e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to men that have no underſtanding.</p>

                  </p>

                  <p>Fourthly, An inordinate love to ſome luſt, or to the world: So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though <note place="margin">4.</note> in the general they know better, and have this perſwaſion on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, yet the violence of ſome indeared luſt carrieth away all with it, as ſome violent torrent: Thus the yong man, that thought he had kept all the Commandments, when our Saviour tried him in that where his heart lay, he went away then very ſorrowful, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. 22.

                  <p>Thus Chriſt called his people <hi>A little flock,</hi> Luk. 12. 32. <hi>Fear not little flock;</hi> As the number of precious ſtones is few to the pibble and gravel ones that lie in the fields; and as the weeds are farre more then the flowers; ſo its here: In the Church of God there are more that are droſſe then gold, more that are ſtubble for hell fire, then prepared perſons for glory.</p>
                  <p>Now let's open this Doctrine; And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, This truth about the paucity of thoſe that are elected, may be handled either ſinfully or profitably; ſinfully, as when it is treated on onely to ſatisfie curioſity, and to keep up a meer barren ſpeculative diſpute. Thus that man was exerciſed, who came to our Saviour, and asked him, <hi>Whether there were few that ſhould be ſaved?</hi> Luk. 13. 23. Therefore our Saviour did not directly anſwer to the Queſtion, becauſe he would not nouriſh that ſinful humour in man. This point then of Election but of a remnant and few of mankinde, is not to be agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated in a verbal and contentious way, but in a ſaving way, to make us tremble,
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:30767:349"/>
and to ſet us upon a more diligent and cloſe ſtriving with God in prayer and all other duties. Hence our Saviour though he would not encourage that Queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt in a way of curioſity, yet he did indirectly anſwer it, by bidding the ſame perſon, <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, for broad was the way that did lead to death; but narrow was the way that did lead to eternal life, and few enter therein;</hi> So then this Doctrine, if any other, ſhould produce ſobriety, holy fear and trembling. For what prayer, agonies, conflicts ſhould this work in every hearer?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Conſider the aggravation of the Doctrine, Many are called and few</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>are choſen, even of thoſe that are called;</hi> and therefore, as you heard, it is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference made from the man who came to the feaſt, ſate down with all boldneſs, and yet becauſe he had no wedding garment, was wholly excluded; and this indeed makes the conſideration of this point more terrible and ſharp; for had it been ſaid, Of all the men in the world, there are but a few that are elected to eternal glory, this would not have ſtruck ſo much trembling; for who would not have thought it very probable, that thoſe who are within the Church, thoſe that are within the Ark, none of them ſhould periſh? But this ſhould wound at the very heart, that even of thoſe who have called Lord, Lord, who have propheſied, wrought miracles, enjoyed the Ordinances, that an handful of theſe ſhould be ſaved: <hi>Oh the depths of the counſel of God!</hi> How can man ſit and hear theſe things, and not be dar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed into the very heart? As they cried out when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>One of you ſhall betray me, Is it I Lord? Is it I Lord?</hi> And thus now when the Scripture ſpeaks, Many of you perſons called ſhall be dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, Is not every one to ſay, Is it I Lord? Is it I Lord?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>That notwithſtanding few are elected comparatively to thoſe that are left</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>by God;</hi> yet if you take the number of the elect abſolutely in themſelves, ſo there is <hi>a great number of them.</hi> Hence many are ſaid to <hi>come and ſit down with Abraham, Matth. 8. 11. in the kingdom of Heaven;</hi> and the ſpiritual ſeed that is given unto Chriſt, is very great, compared to the <hi>dew of the morning,</hi> Pſal. 110. Hence in the <hi>Revelation</hi> you reade of <hi>many thouſands ſealed in every Tribe.</hi> It hath been a conceit of ſome of the Ancients, that ſo many ſhall be repaired out of man-kinde, as will make up the number of the Angels that fell. Their opinion is, That for the many Angels that fell, there ſhall riſe up ſo many men in their room, and God will have that number compleated; but here is no ground for this out of the Scripture; We may truly ſay, that howſoever it be a few in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of others, yet it is an <hi>All</hi> abſolutely conſidered in themſelves; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſometimes called the <hi>world,</hi> and <hi>all men,</hi> as ſome Divines do expound thoſe places.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The powerful and effectual preaching of this Doctrine, is no juſt ground</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4. The Doctrine of Reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no ground of deſpair to any.</note> 
                     <hi>of deſpair to any.</hi> None can rationally conclude, Becauſe there are ſo few that ſhall be ſaved, therefore its likely I ſhall be damned, I have no hopes. Oh if this be true, then farewell all comfort and all joy, would I had never been made a man, <hi>&amp;c!</hi> The beaſts of the field, and the birds of the air are happier. But this is gathering poyſon out of a ſweet herb; for howſoever this be true, yet no man in his particular may conclude himſelf a reprobate; for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>God layeth it as a duty upon every one to repent and to believe, to come to him,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">1.</note> 
                     <hi>and he ſhall have reſt to his ſoul.</hi> If then it be thy duty to believe, to repent, what doſt thou trouble thy ſelf about thy election or reprobation? The way to make this Election ſure to thee, is by giving all heed and diligence unto every work of grace: If then thou believeſt, thou repenteſt, this may be a ſure teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony unto thee of thy everlaſting glory; ſo then notwithſtanding this truth, <hi>Few are choſen,</hi> yet thoſe things are likewiſe true, Whoſoever ſhall believe, whoſoever ſhall repent, ſhall be ſaved; And <hi>Whoſoever comes unto Chriſt he will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Therefore this election of God doth not infringe thoſe uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal

promiſes and invitations that the Scripture holds out. Neither may a man thus query, Am I elected or reprobated? But, Is it my duty to repent or not? Is it my duty to draw nigh unto God or not? And therefore you may obſerve, That thoſe who hold Abſolute Election, can go as farre in adminiſtring comfort to any troubled ſinner, as thoſe that hold Univerſal Grace or Redemption; for no Arminian dare ſay, God will ſave thee whether thou believe and repent or not, that is all one; but thou muſt believe and repent, then mercy is prepared for thee; and thus univerſally can and may the Orthodox ſay.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>This is no ground of deſpair, becauſe no man can know his reprobation.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> No man can ever truly ſay, I know I am not choſen, I know I am not elected. Its true, ſome have ſaid ſo in temptations, ſome have cried out ſo in the horror of conſcience that hath been upon them; but as <hi>Peter</hi> in a transfiguration ſpake he knew not what; ſo theſe in a black and ſad temptation. Secret things belong unto God, revealed things unto us: God keeps that book of mens names that are eternally left by him in his own cuſtody: Even as the day of Judgement, the time of it, is kept ſecret. Its true indeed, There may be a certain knowledge of our Election, not as it is in the fountain and decree of God, but by the ſure and bleſſed effects thereof, which the Scripture doth abundantly witneſſe; and there is great uſe of ſuch neceſſity, becauſe hereby God hath the greater praiſe and glory; and a man is more imboldened and encouraged in all the afflictions that do accompany the profeſſion of Chriſt. See how <hi>Paul</hi> doth triumph over all by the ſenſe of this love comforting his heart. But now if a man ſhould know he were reprobated in this life, it would breed in him all deſperate obſtinacy to commit all wickedneſſe with all delight, and he would take himſelf diſobliged from all the duties commanded, that he was not bound to repent or believe, or to pray, no more then the already damned in hell.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Therefore this cannot breed deſpair, becauſe if there be any ſoul broken</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>for ſinne, troubled under the guilt of it, we Miniſters of the Goſpel have a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to preach peace and pardon to ſuch a ſoul.</hi> Oh then there is no cauſe thou ſhouldſt bewail thy reprobate condition, that God had no thoughts of thee, but rather thy hard and ſtony heart, that will not relent, that will not grieve, that will not hunger and thirſt after Chriſt. For let us meet with ſuch a ſoul, as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of that man of <hi>Jericho,</hi> wounded with ſin, and we muſt pour oil into it. We dare not keep comfort from any one who diſcovers unfeigned ſigns of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; yea if need be, we may in particular abſolve, and acquit in the name of the Lord, ſuch a ſinner from his ſins, and the Lord he will confirm it, <hi>Whoſe ſins ye looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in Heaven,</hi> Matth. 18. Oh then that we had ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, as to adminiſter this balme of <hi>Gilead!</hi> Oh that we could meet with ſuch perſons, and we would ſay, <hi>Be of good comfort, thy ſinnes are forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>It cannot be any ground of deſpair, for there is more poſſibility of thy</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>Salvation, by Gods abſolute Election, then by Univerſal Grace or Redemption,</hi> as the Authors of that Doctrine maintain it; So that if a man were put to chooſe which Doctrine he would have, as putting him into the greater poſſibility of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, he would rationally chooſe the former way. For by an Abſolute Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction ſome are ſure to be ſaved, but by the Doctrine of thoſe univerſaliſts, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Univerſal Grace, and Chriſts dying for all, not one man may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; God may loſe all the glory of his mercy, and Chriſt all the fruit of his ſufferings, and a mans ſalvation is hereby made the more unlikely, in that they have not been able to inſtance of any one Heathen amongſt many thouſands that improved his naturals ſo well, as to have Grace given him.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>This few number that are ſaid to be choſen, are ſo preciſely determined</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>and ordained by God, that it can neither be leſſened or multiplied.</hi> When the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had ſpoken of the fall of ſome eminent perſons, he addeth, <hi>Nevertheleſſe the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure,</hi> 2 Tim. 2. 19. <hi>having this title, The Lord knoweth
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:30767:350"/>
who are his:</hi> So that if the daies of a mans life are numbred with God, that there cannot be one day taken from them, or added to them; much more muſt this hold in that ſoveraign and glorious decree. Inſomuch that it is falſe Doctrine to ſay to any man, If thou art not predeſtinated, pray thou maieſt be; for this is Gods eternal purpoſe before the foundations of the world were laid, and are farre ſtronger then thoſe Decrees of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Perſians,</hi> which were ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable <hi>that they could not be changed;</hi> and ſuch a prayer would be as if we would intreat God to create the world. There is none of theſe choſen ones ſhall ever be caſt away as a reprobate, <hi>None of the bones of Chriſt were broken,</hi> much leſſe will he loſe any of his living members; The love of God is unchangeably pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon his people, and thoſe that are his <hi>Ammi,</hi> his people, in this ſenſe have this mercy, he will never ſay to them, <hi>Loammi,</hi> you are not my people.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Theſe that are thus choſen by God, of his meer good will and gracious</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>pleaſure, God findes not any thing in one called perſon more then another that ſhould diſtinguiſh them. Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>Who hath made thee to differ from another?</hi> 1 Cor. 4. 7. And indeed if in theſe earthly mercies, its God that gives ſome riches, and not another; ſome wealth, and not another; ſome health, and not another; How much rather then is it God, that gives one grace to repent, and not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; one a broken and a contrite heart, and not another? Thus alwaies in the Scripture, you ſhall finde that repentance is Gods gift. To believe and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the myſtery of the Goſpel, is given to one and not to another. Thoſe then that are thus choſen, are to be raviſhed with the conſideration of free Grace, that God out of his good pleaſure ſhould make ſuch a large difference between him and others that it may be have been leſſe ſinners, and have leſſe diſhonoured God then he hath done. How thankful muſt the <hi>Iſraelite</hi> needs have been to ſee the deſtroying Angel paſſe by his houſe, and ſtrike at the next <hi>Aegyptian</hi> houſe to him! How much more then are the godly to rejoyce, who have the ſtroak of eternal damnation paſſing by them, but falling heavily upon others!</p>
                  <p>And if you object, ſaying, <hi>All is of Gods meer pleaſure, and its wholly of God,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                     <hi>that one is left, and another is taken; then a mans damnation and deſtruction is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be imputed unto God; then a man is no more in fault; for who hath reſiſted his will?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this we anſwer: That howſoever it be Gods Soveraign good pleaſure to <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> chooſe ſome and not others, yet a mans damnation is wholly of himſelf in reſpect of the meritorious cauſe; for no man is damned preciſely, becauſe God hath not choſen him, becauſe he is not elected, but becauſe he is a ſinner, and doth wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully refuſe the means of grace offered: inſomuch that there is no ſinner, but he doth as willingly and readily ſinne with as much choice and delight, as if he were not at all left by God; and therefore the Scripture doth wholly attribute a mans deſtruction to his own ſelf: Let no man think then to evade Gods Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice under this pretence. No, God will be juſtified, and every man will be found to be a ſinner. Neither may this be thought injuſtice in God, for if he had not ſaved one man, none could have blamed him; we ſee he did not ſpare one of the Apoſtate Angels; Thus alſo might he have done with all man-kinde. Let us therefore admire the goodneſſe of God that chooſeth any to eternal life.</p>
                  <p>But a ſecond Objection, which cavillers uſe to make, is, <hi>If God hath thus</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                     <hi>choſen ſome, and left others, then all our labours and endeavours after God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, are in vain; Why ſhould I pray? Should I ſeek after God, all may be in vain?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this the Anſwer is eaſie: Thou muſt live by the revealed will of God, not <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> by the ſecret: Now Gods revealed will cals for ſuch duties, commands ſuch graces of every one. What is Gods ſecret will none can tell thee, but in the Word he hath ſhewed thee, O man, what thou art to do: Do not thou then
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:30767:350"/>
cavil, and argue againſt thy Duty? But hear what the Scripture ſaith, Tremble under what God doth require of thee, thou art ſure the neglect of theſe Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will be unto thee an evident token of perdition. Neither do the Orthodox aſſert ſuch an Abſolute Decree as doth oppoſe ordered means, but Conditions ſuſpended upon the uncertain will of man. We ſee the Scripture poſitively aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting ſuch an Election of God before the foundations of the world: we ſee it alſo as poſitive and peremptory in commands for the uſe of the means. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theſe two things may ſtand together: Let not then the difficulty of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling them make thee deny either; and if upon prayer and ſtudy thou canſt not pitch on a way for their concord (for ſeveral learned men differ herein, ſome going one way, ſome another) do then rather ſubmit thy underſtanding, then preſumptuouſly deny the truth, as thou doeſt in the matter of the Trinity; and this counſel, about a point very near it, not all one with this, doth <hi>Cajetan</hi> the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Schoolman give.</p>
                  <p>And thus much for Explication: The ground why of many called, few are <note place="margin">Signs that but but few are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> choſen <hi>à priori,</hi> is, as you heard, Gods will, <hi>Who doth in Heaven and Earth what pleaſeth him. Paul</hi> in the ninth of the <hi>Romans</hi> hath ſo fully determined this, that its a wonder any have had the fore-head to riſe up and diſpute againſt it; We rather are to admire the mercy of God, <hi>that a few are choſen,</hi> rather then to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute why not more, or all. The Church in her temporal affliction did bleſſe God for the remnant that was ſaved; and we are much more to praiſe God for any that are elected to eternal life.</p>
                  <p>And then the ground <hi>à Posteriori,</hi> or which is rather a ſign that few are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, may be evidenced by conſidering the lives of thoſe that are called, <hi>View then and judge by the Scripture, and you muſt then conclude few are choſen.</hi> For out of the number of thoſe that are called outwardly, Take</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>All ignorant Perſons;</hi> and then you remove a great number. That no groſſely ignorant perſon, living and dying ſo, is choſen, appeareth plainly, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God would have men come to the knowledge of the truth, and ſo to be ſaved, 1 Tim.</hi> 2. 4. And converſion is an enlightning of the minde; its the giving of a man a ſpiritual underſtanding; <hi>They are a people of no underſtanding, therfore he that made them will not ſave them,</hi> Iſa. 23. 11. So then, we are to bid all ignorant people, <hi>Stand you by,</hi> you are not of the choſen ones by any outward ſign. As yet you are in a damnable condition: Oh pray that God would open your blinde eyes!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>From thoſe that are called. Take away the prophane and ungodly man in his life, and then the number is ſtill leſſe and leſſe.</hi> Are not the ignorant and the prophane men the greater part of called perſons? But now if any man be a vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ungodly perſon, he muſt alſo ſtand aloof off: Here are no ſigns of thy Election, as yet; yea there are the Plague-tokens for the preſent of Gods eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal diſpleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is a third ſort to be taken away, and that is, <hi>Of thoſe indeed who live a civil and unblameable life, unſpotted from all ſinne and wickedneſſe, but yet have never felt within themſelves the mighty power of God renewing their natures.</hi> What a ſmall number by this time will that of the choſen perſons be, when thoſe that live in a fair and ingenuous way, but never taſted the good word of God upon their hearts, are alſo bid to depart, here is no comfort for them.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>Yet once more take away all thoſe, who have the common gifts and graces of Gods Spirit, who have ſome inward workings of illumination, and joy, and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in their hearts;</hi> but yet becauſe they do not dig deep enough, and want root, are therefore carried no further then hypocrites and reprobates: Such there are, and our Saviour doth often give his Diſciples warning, leſt they go no further then theſe. Now then put all theſe together, The Ignorant Perſon, The Prophane, The Civil, and the Temporary Believer, and take the reſt, and you will ſay, Oh how few are choſen!</p>

                     <hi>Uſe of Examination.</hi> Try your ſelves under this truth, Hath Chriſt ſpoken it <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> once and twice? It will prove true, That though <hi>Many are called, yet few are choſen:</hi> Oh then ſearch, and again ſearch and try your wayes! Oh enquire, whether thou art in the number of thoſe choſen ones or no! for the thing may be known. The Scripture gives many characters of thoſe that are thus choſen, Do thou then fall upon this ſtudy. Oh do not hear and hear, but fall preſently upon the work! The ſigns are theſe:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Thoſe that are choſen to glory, they are likewiſe choſen to grace here. Election will in due time have its effectual vocation. If God appoint thee to eternal life, he doth here in this world appoint thee to a gracious and heavenly life. As thy glory and happineſſe is a choice mercy, ſo are thy thoughts, thy actions choiſe actions. Is thy whole converſation ſelected and removed from ſinne and filthineſſe. This is a ſure argument, No Sanctification no Election, No choice Grace no choice Glory. Thou art to be a precious jewel here, ere God will make thee up at that great day.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Thoſe that are choſen, they have the Spirit of God beſtowed on them:</hi> He is the fruit of this Election, and a three-fold work the Spirit of God puts forth in them: Its</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>A Spirit of Prayer,</hi> Rom. 8. which teacheth us how to pray, and what to pray; which makes our hearts full of conflicts and ſpiritual agonies in prayer. Thy earneſt, effectual prayers demonſtrate thy Election.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Its the Spirit of Adoption, enabling us to call God Father:</hi> This is a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table fruit in thoſe that are choſen; They have a Filial and Evangelical frame of heart. They have a godly boldneſſe and confidence in Gods love.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Its a witneſſing and ſealing Spirit to them,</hi> it aſſures and ſeals unto them the love and favour of God, and by the Spirits aſſiſtance they come to be thus per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded. Alas, they have no ſuch certainty of themſelves, as the choiſeſt colours cannot be ſeen without the benefit of the light.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Thoſe that are thus choſen, they have a heavenly delight and excellent joy in drawing nigh to God;</hi> His Ordinances are excellent, his Word is excellent, his Sabbaths are a delight. They prize thoſe things more then the worldly man his treaſure, the voluptuous man his pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>They that are thus choſen, they walk with an holy fear and trembling.</hi> Their heavenly joy and aſſurance doth not degenerate into preſumption or neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the means. No, <hi>Paul</hi> beats down his body, that he may not become a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate; and he giveth this general rule, <hi>Work out your Salvation with fear and trembling.</hi> Theſe are the fruits of Election, not as if all that were choſen had them at all times, or altogether, or in a perfect manner, but with much conflict and imperfection.</p>

                  <p>THe Doctrine contained in the adverſative or exceptive part of this Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, carrieth much terror with it; for how eaſily may the ſoul be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged under this conſideration, The fewneſs of thoſe that are elected or ſaved? Now although there are few who need encouragements, the greater part of our Auditors being preſumptuous and ſelf-confident; yet that I may handle this truth compleatly, I ſhall Anſwer this particular caſe of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>What that perſon ſhould do, who is overwhelmed with fears and thoughts whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he belong to Election or no,</hi> whether he hath any intereſt in the Covenant of <note place="margin">A Caſe of conſcience.</note> Grace; for though but few, yet ſome ſuch there are, who through the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their own heart, and Satans ſubtil temptations, are many times caſt down, as if there were no hope for them: Though God be gracious to others, yet not to them; inſomuch, That they ſit down like deflowred <hi>Tamar,</hi> weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wailing, not knowing whether to go; would not therefore he be like a Meſſenger from God, that could tell how to eaſe the ſoul of this burthen? But before I apply my ſelf to this ſatisfaction, I ſhall adde ſome further ſigns and effects of Election, to what I propounded the laſt day; and certainly, if the hearts of men were as careful to make their Election ſure, as they are to make the Evidences of their Eſtates, or any outward advantage they enjoy, even a little ſaid, may do good unto them. In worldly things that Rule is received, <hi>Tene certum, dimitte incertum,</hi> Hold that which is certain, and let <note place="margin">More ſigns and effects of Election.</note> that go which is uncertain: Why then are ye not as wiſe in this reſpect? Thy outward mercies, thy ſecurity, and quietneſs of conſcience, theſe are no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſigns of thy Election; therefore let them go and put no more confidence in them. We proceed to adde more, That he who is not convinced in the want of one, may be in the want of the other. And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>They that are thus choſen, the preaching of the Goſpel comes not unto them in word onely, but in a full and efficacious power on their heart, and aſſurance of their underſtanding:</hi> We Miniſters of the Goſpel may here take up our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, <note place="margin">4</note> To whom is the Goſpel preached, any more then meer bare words? Do not our Sermons, as the Pſalmiſt ſaid of our lives, <hi>Paſs away as a tale that is told?</hi> Oh this is an ill ſign! conſider that place, 1 <hi>Theſſ. 1. 4, 5. Knowing (bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) your Election of God:</hi> The Apoſtle ſpeaks ſo of others, either in the
<pb n="650" facs="tcp:30767:353"/>
judgement of charity, or from that ſpirit of diſcerning, which was vouchſafed ſome in the Apoſtles times: Well, how comes <hi>Paul</hi> to know this? by this glorious effect, <hi>Verſe 5. For our Goſpel came not unto you in word onely, but alſo in power, and in the Holy Ghoſt, and in much aſſurance:</hi> See what the end and iſſue of every Sermon ſhould be, it ſhould come with power, and with the Holy Ghoſt into your hearts; <hi>viz.</hi> The Spirit of God accompanying the word, works faith, converſion, and a through reformation of our lives: Its therefore very good to conſider, with what power the word preached falls into thy heart: Doth it convince thee, humble thee, mollifie and ſoften thee, this argueth thou belongeſt to God. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. Our Saviour argued on the contrary, that the Phariſees were not of God, becauſe they did not hear with faith and obedience his word: Thus you ſee, great diſcoveries may be made of men, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the efficacy Gods word hath upon their hearts. Every faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter is like <hi>Iohn,</hi> a voyce, but if he be no more, then he ſaid of the Nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale, <hi>vox &amp; praeterea nihil,</hi> a voyce, and nothing elſe; woe be to that Auditor who feels it no more: <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was no more to his hearers; God tell shim, <hi>He was like a pleaſant ſong to them,</hi> Ezek. 33. 32. they would come and hear as his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, but they would do nothing; If therefore the Election of God ever put forth any glorious power on thee, thou wilt finde it in this ſome time or other, that the word preached will be more then the word of a man, more then a meer humane Oration, or verbal Declamation: Oh! it will be like fire in thy bowels, like a two edged ſword in the ſecret places of thy heart; thou wilt cry out, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily God is here: Oh the power, the conviction, the meltings of my ſoul that I feel within me!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>A further effect of Predeſtination, is a conformity to the image of Chriſt:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> Thus the Apoſtle expreſly affirmeth, <hi>Rom. 8. 26. Whom he did foreknow, he did predeſtinate to be conformed to the image of his ſon:</hi> This is a glorious fruit, to be made like Chriſt, to have the image of Chriſt in us, affections like Chriſt, zeal and heavenlineſs like Chriſt. This conformity unto Chriſt, may be in three things:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That which is future and to come; <hi>viz.</hi> To be glorified, as he is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: Thus the Apoſtle elſewhere ſaith, <hi>Our vile bodies, ſhall be made conformable unto his glorious body,</hi> Phil. 3. 21. and as we have carried the image of the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſo we ſhall the image of the heavenly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 49. An ineſtimable priviledge it is: But I intend not that.</p>
                  <p>The Second particular of conformity, is the grace and holineſs of Chriſt; that as he was altogether holy, humble, doing the will of God readily in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular, ſo ſhould we. Hence we are commanded <hi>To be followers of him,</hi> and, <hi>To put on the Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 12. 14 as a garment which covers the whole body; ſo that we are to expreſs the ſavor and life of Chriſt in all that we do, let nothing of our ſin, our nakedneſs appear, but every thing like Chriſt: How excellently did <hi>Paul</hi> arrive to this, when he could ſay, <hi>I no longer live, but Chriſt within me. Hierom</hi> ſaid of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> That he did <hi>Diligere Chriſtum habitantem in Auguſtino,</hi> he loved Chriſt dwelling in <hi>Auſtin:</hi> Oh! this image and ſuperſcription they bear who are elected; they ſhall, at leaſt ere they dye, manifeſt the life and power of Chriſt dwelling in them. Conſider then, are thy affections, thy thoughts, thy actions ſuch as reſemble Chriſt? Thoſe that are elected, are predeſtinated to ſuch a conformity.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There is a conformity unto Chriſt, in regard of his ſufferings, and patient obedience thereunto: This ſome interpreters make to be the chief ſcope of the place; that as Chriſt had in this life a ſuffering, afflicted and perſecuted life, in all which he was full of humility and patience, and after this he was exalted to glory; ſo it will fall out with every member of Chriſt; every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as well as the head, ſhall have a ſtate of humiliation, before a ſtate of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation:
<pb n="651" facs="tcp:30767:353"/>
Let not thoſe then who will live in the power of godlineſs, expect great and comfortable things always in this world: Though they be choſen ones with God, yet with the world they may be the off-ſcouring and dregs of mankinde.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The third effect, <hi>Is thankfulneſs, and continual hearty gratitude un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>God for this ſo great and unſpeakable a mercy:</hi> You can no more keep in the heart from overflowing, when its ſenſible of this everlaſting love of God, then you can put bounds to the ſea: See <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 1. and in other places, with what heavenly joy and inlarged thankfulneſs he amplifieth the love and grace of God in electing of us before the foundations of the world; he cannot ſatisfie himſelf with any words, but heaps them up one upon another; and certainly, in that God hath elected and choſen thee, he hath done more for thee, then if he ſhould give thee all the glory of the world. That elect Lady <hi>Iohn</hi> wrote un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, was more happy in being elected, then in all the external glory ſhe had; How then is thy heart affected with joy, and praiſe, and thankfulneſs in this matter? He that beſtoweth great things, looks for great return of thanks, eſpecially this being all we can do.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Thoſe that are elected, have a ſpirit of heavenly fortitude and courage</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>beſtowed upon them, whereby they are able to rejoyce and triumph in all adverſities and troubles:</hi> The apprehenſion of this doth ſo animate them, that like <hi>Salaman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> they live in the fire of perſecution; like the Ark, they are ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drowned in the waters, that thereby they are exalted nearer Heaven. Read <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. What glorious triumphs doth <hi>Paul,</hi> in the perſon of all the elected, make over all kinde of Enemies that can be thought on! he challengeth every adverſary to put forth his ſting: Now whence comes all this boldneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence? even becauſe God had elected, and nothing can ſeparate them from this unchangeable love: How can men endure the loſs of goods, eſtates, name and life it ſelf, did not a gracious aſſurance of this, raiſe them up above all humane ſtrength? This is the <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> unto their deſpondent ſpirits; this makes them, with <hi>Paul,</hi> ſay to all friends that would hinder them in ſuſtering for God, <hi>Why do you break my heart? I am ready not onely to be bound, but to dye for Chriſts ſake.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>The laſt and glorious effect of Election, is perſeverance, and a ſtedfaſt continuance in that way of grace they are at firſt ſet in:</hi> Final Apoſtacy, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal <note place="margin">3.</note> backſliding from the ways of God, can never befal thoſe that are thus cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen: <hi>If it were poſsible,</hi> Mat. 24. 24. The elect would be deceived with the ſigns and wonders of lying Prophets: <hi>They went from us, becauſe they were not of us,</hi> ſaid the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2. 19. many places might be brought to this purpoſe; eſpecially that promiſe, <hi>Ier.</hi> 32. 40. which is nothing but the Covenant of Grace, and the execution of Gods decree from all eternity, <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall never depart from me:</hi> Oh what a bleſſed mercy is this! when there are ſo many hours of temptation in the world, ſo many bluſtring ſtorms and tempeſts, that are able to raiſe up the very roots, did not that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal ſeed preſerve them. Thus having added ſome more neceſſary effects, that demonſtrate this calling and election of God, I now apply my ſelf to pour oyl into that wounded heart I mentioned, to that tender conſcience who is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with fear and trembling, leaſt not ſo much as the crums that fall from this table do belong to it; that refuſe to be comforted, ſaying with <hi>Zion, God hath forſaken her.</hi> And</p>

                     <pb n="652" facs="tcp:30767:354"/>
even Chriſt himſelf was tempted in this manner, though without ſin: Was not this the meaning of thoſe heavy groans and crys, the Apoſtle ſaith he uttered, ſaying, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? My God, my God,</hi> there were the expreſſions of faith, adhering and relying; but, <hi>why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> they were the words of one not feeling the ſenſible comfort and ſupport of God at that preſent; which was not ſimply a ſin, but part of that ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agony, and ſoul-ſufferings he did undergo for us. Well then, let no tender heart, and troubled ſoul be dejected, if it be exerciſed with ſuch black tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for theſe things have befallen the godly, yea, Chriſt himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Lay this down aſſuredly, that all thoſe thoughts and ſuggeſtions, as</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>if thou wert not choſen, come onely from the Devil, and are his poyſoned arrows that he darts into thee:</hi> He is the Prince of darkneſs, and loveth to keep the ſoul in darkneſs; he is the Accuſer of the Brethren, not onely to God, but accuſeth God to them, as an hard maſter, as one that did watch to damn and deſtroy: Now that they come from Satan, is plain, becauſe they are contrary to the ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: All ſpirits muſt be tryed by the Scripture, and ſo thou muſt try thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit by the Scripture: Well then, thy ſpirit ſaith, God hath not choſen thee, God hath not ordained thee to eternal glory; now ſay, Where doth the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture reveal any ſuch thing? where doth Gods word manifeſt any ſuch thing? If then the Scripture diſcover no ſuch thing, it comes but from that lying ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and thy lying heart together; ſay therefore in all ſuch temptations, <hi>Get thee behinde me Satan, theſe things ſavour not of the Scripture, theſe things come not from Gods ſpirit;</hi> therefore Gods ſpirit is called <hi>The Comforter,</hi> becauſe he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth the ſoul to believe in Gods gracious promiſes; Gods ſpirit, is the ſpirit of Adoption, which inableth us to cry, <hi>Abba Father;</hi> thus the ſpirit of God, where that is, diſpels all tormenting fears, all ſinful dejections, carrieth on the heart to Evangelical conſiderations: Now this ſhould exceedingly prevail with the tender heart, when it feels all thoſe ſad and heavy preſſures: All theſe things are contrary to Gods ſpirit, they grieve the ſpirit of God, as well as my own ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Conſider, <hi>We are not to live by our own experiences and feelings that we have, whether of joy, or fears, but by the word of God:</hi> Its a very dangerous <note place="margin">3.</note> deluſion, when a man makes his own ſenſe and experience, the rule to walk by: He muſt bring his heart, and all things to the word, to be directed by it, guided by it. Now the word of God that commands every one in particular to believe, to repent, to draw near to God; this the word enjoyneth every one, Why then art thou troubling thy ſelf about the ſecret things of God, which can never be known? Theſe revealed commands and duties, they belong to thee; How much better were it therefore to ſhake off all thoſe temptations, as <hi>Paul</hi> did the Viper from his hand; and ſay, Let me riſe up and fall to my duty: The command is plain, unqueſtionable, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are heavy laden,</hi> Mat. 11. <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth come,</hi> John 7. Now then, if theſe Texts be ſo clear, ſo evident, how dareſt thou refuſe them? If ſin trouble thee, then let ſin againſt theſe Commandments trouble thee. We have a moſt pregnant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in this caſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. 22. The woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> when ſhe deſired help from Chriſt, ſee what a repulſe Chriſt gave her, <hi>Its not fit to give childrens bread to Dogs:</hi> He calls her a Dog, he tells her, childrens bread did not belong to her; Whoſe heart would not this break? was not this in effect to tell her, ſhe was a reprobate, the promiſe of Grace did not belong to her? Though Chriſt ſpake this by way of tryal, to draw out her importunity the more: Well, what ſaith the woman to all this? yet ſhe will catch ſome thing for an argument ſtill of hope, <hi>Truth Lord, yet the Dogs eat of the crums that fall from the table:</hi> Let me be a Dog, let me be unworthy, I confeſs my ſelf ſo, I feel my ſelf ſo, yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not the crums, the leaſt mercy I ſhall prize; and upon this anſwer what great commendation did Chriſt give her faith? Look you then, here is a
<pb n="653" facs="tcp:30767:354"/>
copy for thee to write after, endeavor to be like this woman; O Lord, though I feel no comfort, though I be a Caſt-away, though I be a dog, yet let me have but the crums, the leaſt expreſſions of thy love, and they will refreſh me: So that you ſee, theſe temptations are not to deject, but to draw out thy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, to quicken up thy affections, as you ſhall hear afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Thou oughteſt to be ſo far from being diſcouraged, becauſe of theſe ſad</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>temptations and fears, that thou oughteſt the more to rejoyce, and to take theſe groans and crys, as the ſure ſigns and ſimptomes of thy predeſtination;</hi> For ſo we told you, where this election was, there the ſpirit of God did accompany the ſoul with prayers and groans unutterable: So that thoſe exerciſes and troubles of heart, they are to be a great ground of comfort and hope to thee; thou art to rejoyce and bleſs God, that puts thee in ſuch agonies, ſuch exerciſes, though for the preſent ſo heavy and unſupportable: Alas! he that is a reprobate, and indeed forſaken by God, he is never thus troubled, he is given up to a ſtony heart, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was; and therefore ſuch are ſaid to have a blinde eye, a deaf ear, a fat heart, that cannot underſtand: No, thoſe that are thus forſaken by God, they make a mock of ſin, they eat and drink, and go down quick to hell: Let not then, thoſe things which ought to comfort thee, be matter of diſcouragement to thee: Turn not honey into gall.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Conſider, <hi>The unprofitableneſs, and ſinfulneſs of all ſuch fears:</hi> They <note place="margin">5.</note> come to no good at all, they are thorns in thy ſide, and hinder thee in all that livelineſs and power of godlineſs that ought to be; they hinder thy praying, thy obedience, thy comfortable diſcharge of thy relation, duties: <hi>The joy of the Lord is your ſtrength,</hi> ſaid <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> Nehem. 8. 10. and fear, that makes feeble hands, and feeble knees: ſo that as that timber which is eaten into by worms, cannot ſerve for ſtrong building; ſo neither can thoſe who are devoured by theſe temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, be for that while ſerviceable unto God: Know then, if thou wilt fear, thou haſt cauſe to fear theſe fears, thou haſt cauſe to take heed thou doeſt not run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin, while thou art afraid of ſin.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Examine thy ſelf, whether thou doeſt not live in ſome known ſecret ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repented</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>of;</hi> and that puts thee upon the queſtion of all; or whether thou haſt not groſly fallen from thy former love, and power of godlineſs: Theſe things many times raiſe a dark and gloomy miſt upon the ſoul. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32. when <hi>David</hi> kept cloſe his ſin, and did not confeſs it, that made great trouble and perplexity in his ſoul. As vapors got in the bowels of the earth, and finding no vent, make a terrible earthquake.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly and laſtly, <hi>Grant all thy fears and troubles to be upon juſt grounds, yet if</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">7.</note> 
                     <hi>thou muſt periſh, periſh depending upon God:</hi> Take up <hi>Jobs</hi> reſolution, <hi>Though he kill me, yet will I truſt in him;</hi> as <hi>Heſter,</hi> venter to go into Gods preſence, and ſay, <hi>If I periſh, I periſh,</hi> and thou wilt finde as ſhe did, the King of Heaven <note place="margin">Job 13. 15.</note> holding out the Scepter of grace: Thou art ſure to be damned by unbelief, and by keeping off from God, but its poſſible to meet with ſalvation, yea, its ſure, if thou draw near to God: As thoſe Lepers were ſure to periſh with famine, if they ſtaid in the place they were in, therefore they would venture, though in the enemies Countrey: And thus much for application of comfort.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall conclude with an Uſe of Admonition, Try your ſelves about theſe fore-mentioned fruits of election; do not reject theſe things, as nothing belonging to thee: Oh! doeſt not thou ſee thy ſelf as yet in the ſtate of gall and bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? what mean thoſe groſs impieties, thoſe unfruitful and unreformed ways, under ſo much preaching? Put thy mouth in the duſt, if yet there may be hope; pray, and again pray, God would deliver thee from thoſe ſins that overcome thee.</p>

                  <p>THe Apoſtle in this Epiſtle, as for the moſt part in others, divideth his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe into two parts; The firſt whereof is didactical, informing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming in matters of Faith and Doctrine. The ſecond is moral and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, wholly tending to form us in a Chriſtian and heavenly life. Now in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this Chapter, wherein my Text is the firſt verſe, the Apoſtle betakes himſelf to an wholſome and ſavoury Exhortation, to live in the powerful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of all the graces of Gods Spirit. And firſt, he layeth down his Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the general; and then inſtanceth in particulars.</p>
                  <p>The general Duty is my Text; wherein obſerve,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Duty it ſelf, <hi>Walk worthy:</hi> To walk implieth the perpetual courſe and exerciſe of a mans life. He that ſteps now and then occaſionally in ſuch a path, is not ſaid to walk in it: To be godly by fits, to have ſome pangs and ſudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution; for what is good, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> preſently to let all vaniſh, is not to walk. <hi>To walk worthy;</hi> This is not worth of merit or congruity antecedent to Gods grace calling us. No, he plainly ſuppoſeth the grace of God hath called us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready: and therefore, as it to be ſhewed, it denoteth only a worth of condecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and fitneſſe that is ſubſequent to this holy calling, that all our thoughts, words and actions ſhould be decent, and becoming ſuch an heavenly call. Even as <hi>John</hi> bid them, <hi>Bring forth fruits worthy of repentance,</hi> Luk. 3. 8. that is, fit and beſeeming repentance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You have the object of this Duty, and that is <hi>The Vocation wherewith ye are called;</hi> by this he means, that outward favour of God calling them from their former ignorance and ſins, to the profeſſion of faith and obedience to the Goſpel. They are not now what they were once; They muſt be other men; They muſt conſider their heavenly dignity and condition. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, <hi>While he was a childe, he did all things as a childe; but when a man, he left thoſe childiſh things, and did as a man:</hi> Thus it is here, when thou waſt ignorant, prophane, and a ſtranger from God, thou didſt as ſuch do, but when called by God, then thou takeſt up more holy and divine reſolutions.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There is the argument to inforce it, and that is from the outward conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him, that doth thus intreat them, <hi>A priſoner of the Lord;</hi> one that is in bonds and priſon for the Lords ſake. This he doth to excite their affections, for
<pb n="655" facs="tcp:30767:355"/>
how well might they part with their luſts and unlawful pleaſures, when he had parted with his liberty, and was ready to loſe his life for the Lords ſake! And ſee here the gracious diſpoſition of <hi>Paul,</hi> who being now in priſon and bonds, is not ſollicitous about himſelf, doth not write about means to ſet himſelf at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty; but all his care is, that theſe <hi>Epheſians</hi> might do nothing which ſhould be a ſcandal to Chriſtianity, a reproach to the Goſpel, that all their life ſhould be a praiſe and a glory to that calling God had called them with.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That it is the earneſt and hearty deſire of the faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel, that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> 
                     <hi>all Chriſtians ſhould live ſuch a life, that is worthy and beſeeming ſo excellent a Calling.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are no ſadder objects, then to ſee a prophane, a debaucht, an ungodly Chriſtian; to ſee men profeſſe Chriſt in words, and in works to deny him; For theſe things their ſouls mourn in ſecret. Becauſe of this, they intreat, beſeech and exhort without ceaſing: See the like hot affection burning out in <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1. 11. <hi>VVe pray alwayes for you, that our God would count you worthy of his calling.</hi> We pray alwayes for you; This we never forget; This is alwaies in our heart, that ye may be a people becoming this glorious cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. And indeed its a moſt abſurd and even loathſome ſight, to ſee a man with the ſame mouth pray to God, yet to curſe, ſwear and blaſpheme; with the ſame body, to worſhip God in the Congregations, and to fulfill the luſts of the fleſh. <hi>Solomon</hi> hath two excellent ſayings together, <hi>Prov. 26. v.</hi> 7. and <hi>v.</hi> 9. The firſt is, <hi>The legs of the lame are not equal, ſo is the parable in a fools mouth.</hi> A fool is the wicked man, and a parable is a grave, holy ſentence: Now, ſaith he, as thoſe that are lame and halt, they ſhew an uncomely inequality in their going, ſuch a deformity there is in a wicked man, that yet hath holy truths in his mouth. The ſecond is, <hi>As a thorn goeth up in the hand of a drunkard; ſo is a parable in the mouth of a fool.</hi> The drunkard he feeleth no ſmart, though a thorn run into his hand. Thus a wicked man, though the obligations of Chriſtianity, and his Baptiſm be never ſo piercing and powerful to godlineſſe, yet he feels no efficacy in them.</p>
                  <p>To open this Doctrine, conſider,</p>

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>To do nothing but what is ſutable and connatural with this calling.</hi> Thoſe actions are worthy ſuch an agent, as are ſutable and proper for him. All Agents have their ſutable operations; the fire aſcends, the ſtone deſcends. If therefore the fire ſhould deſcend and go downwards, it would be againſt nature, it would argue great violence. Thus the ſutable and connatural actions of a Chriſtian are to avoid ſin, to walk holily, to be above the world, to keep our ſelves unſpotted from it. Now if any one that is called a Chriſtian be not thus, he doth unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral actions. His principles, his obligations are againſt theſe things. Oh (Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved) if men were real Chriſtians, as well as titular, you ſhould ſee no more prophane and ungodly perſons amongſt us, then venemous and poiſonous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures will be in ſome countreys; It ſhould be even a wonder, a ſtrange thing, that any one ſhould among Chriſtians be found in the way of wickedneſſe: Oh then reflect upon all thy words, all thy actions! Are theſe ſutable? Are theſe proper? Do theſe agree with my Baptiſm, with my profeſſion of Chriſt? How can I call on Chriſt, and do the things Chriſt hateth?</p>

<pb n="656" facs="tcp:30767:356"/>
and ſuch who never heard of Chriſt may glory in all exceſſe of riot, yet this is not decent or becoming a Chriſtian. The Apoſtle forbids <hi>fooliſh jeſting, which is not convenient,</hi> Epheſ. 5. 4. how much more then thy oaths, thy luſts! Oh how indecent and unbecoming are ſuch words and actions! Though other men might drink wine, yet it was not befitting a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> who by vow had ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated himſelf to God, promiſing abſtinence from theſe things; and ſo though the world lieth in wickedneſſe, and glory in their impieties, yet theſe things are not for thee to do, who art ſeparated to God. What then ſhall we think of ſuch perſons, who account their oaths a grace to their mouth, who judge ſtrictneſſe and preciſeneſſe of walking, the moſt indecent and ridiculous way? Oh what do ſuch perſons think of their Divine Vocation? Hath God called us to unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to luſts? Where are your conſciences? Why do they lie ſo faſt aſleep in your breſts, and are not awakened?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>The word implieth glory, and an ornament to this heavenly calling, which</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>is more then meer comelineſſe and decency.</hi> Glory is <hi>clara notitia,</hi> a famous and illuſtrious manifeſtation of ſuch godlineſſe in our lives, that thereby all others may honour the Goſpel, and love that Chriſtianity, which inſtruct them in ſuch things. This our Saviour meaneth, when he commands, <hi>That our light ſhould ſo ſhine before men, that others may glorifie God for us,</hi> Matth. 5. 16. Oh, every Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is to be like a Star or the Sun in the firmament; as lights in the dark night, ſo theſe in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe people: Oh its a wofull thing to be an offence or a ſtumbling block to others, and that is, ſo to live, as that others are more confirmed and encouraged in their wickedneſſe! Look we then upon mens lives, and compare them with their Chriſtian calling, here is no more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then with light and darkneſſe: Oh the reproach and ſcandal they are to Chriſtianity! <hi>Salvian</hi> a godly Ancient doth excellently deſcribe this, What do Pagans ſay, when they ſee Chriſtians live wickedly? They think Chriſt taught them no better, he inſtructed them in no more holineſſe. <hi>Chriſtiani ſanctè vixiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſi Chriſtus ſancta docuiſſet;</hi> Chriſtians would have lived holily, if Chriſt had given them holy commands: Oh blaſphemy!

                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>The word doth imply a giving the preheminence and excellency to thoſe things that beſeem this calling;</hi> That we minde this in the firſt place.

So that this ſhameth thoſe, who never ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider nor meditate, what this Chriſtian profeſſion binds them to; As <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſaid, <hi>Shall ſuch a man as I flee?</hi> He thought it a great diſhonour to him, whatſoever it might be to others. And ſo do thou reflect, Shall ſuch an one as I ſwear, curſe, deal unjuſtly, be proud and earthly? Oh when thou haſt been overcome with ſuch things! ſay truly to thy ſelf, that which <hi>Michal</hi> did falſly to <hi>David, Thou haſt made thy ſelf like one of the vile and baſe ones of the earth.</hi> Thus you have heard what the word <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>They walk worthy of this calling, who have heartily and totally left all that former life God hath called them out from, and have no deſires to return to that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.</hi> By this call God takes us from all thoſe former cuſtomary wayes of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties, that we lived in: Were we prophane? we are ſo no more: Were we proud, earthly, unjuſt? we are ſo no more. God hath called us from ſuch a wretched and curſed eſtate of life. Now a man cannot walk in a meer unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

way of this call, then to deſire to return to his former luſts; To think it was better then with us, then now; we had more pleaſures, more love in the world, more content and eſteem, then ſince we have followed God thus calling of us: Oh wherein can we ſhew our ſelves a people more unworthy of this mercy, then in ſo doing! As it was with the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when God had delivered them out of that place of bondage, and by a mighty hand had wrought wonderful deliverances for them; wherein did they demonſtrate their horrible ingratitude more then in this, <hi>That they would go back again to Egypt?</hi> They pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed not the Manna, but thought of their old fleſh-pots. Thus its as unſufferable wickedneſſe in any man, whom God hath called from his former luſts, and he begins to deſire them again, and to do as he hath done: Oh what is this, but to repent of thy marriage to God! To proclaim to the world, that thou didſt finde more pleaſure and content in luſts, then in the ſervice of God! <hi>Remember Lots wife;</hi> when God had by a merciful hand pulled her out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> ſhe looks back and was immediately turned into a <hi>pillar of ſalt. Auguſtine</hi> ſaid, It was to ſeaſon us; but the Hebrew word for ſalt, may ſignifie brimſtone, or ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, and ſo ſhe was puniſhed in ſome meaſure like the <hi>Sodomites,</hi> partaking of their puniſhments, becauſe ſhe had ſome compliance with their ſins: Oh then conſider thy ſelf! Haſt thou forſaken all thy former dear luſts? Haſt thou bid them all Be gone? Is the very memory of thy former life a ſhame and a bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to thee? Art thou daily bleſſing God, that he hath given thee eyes to ſee and an heart to underſtand thy former life, and that for thouſands of worlds, thou wouldſt not be the man thou once wert? This is to walk worthy of ſo ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a calling.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Thoſe that walk worthy of this heavenly call, they keep themſelves</hi>

                     <hi>unſpotted from the wickedneſſe of the world, they are not conformed to the wayes and cuſtoms thereof.</hi> Thus the Apoſtle prayeth earneſtly, <hi>Rom. 12. That they might not be conformed to the world, but transformed in their minde;</hi> &amp; true religion is that which keeps a man <hi>unſpotted from the world,</hi> Jam. 1. 28. If God hath called thee out of this dungeon, out of this noiſome and filthy place, its for thee to caſt off all thy rags, and not to carry about thee ſo much as the ſmell thereof. The whole world lieth in wickedneſſe, ſaith the Apoſtle; <hi>And if ye were of the world,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>the world would love you.</hi> Though the godly are in it, yet not of it. Thou doſt therefore then walk in a way beſeeming this holy profeſſion, when thy life is ſingular, and contrary to the world, thou hateſt what that loveth, thou loveſt what that hateth. Thy thoughts and affections are above theſe things. As God made the fowls at firſt out of the waters, but they left them, and fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Do not then defile thy ſelf with the pitch here below. Be as the Sun-beams up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the dunghil, that are not polluted by the vapours thereof. Be as thoſe three worthies in this fire, and yet not have thy garments ſinged.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>They are very attentive and diligent to avoid all thoſe wayes that may be</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>an active ſcandal or offence to others.</hi> To walk worthy of the Goſpel is ſo to carry our ſelves, that others may love it, that we may win others by our life and converſation. Now on the other ſide, they walk unworthily of it, who give juſt offence and ſcandal to others, that are ſtumbling blocks in other mens wayes. This is an heavy ſin: our Saviour crieth out of a woe to ſuch men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 7. and ſaith, <hi>It had been better they were thrown into the bottom of the ſea with a milſtone about their necks.</hi> They had better never have been born, that it might be ſaid, There were never ſuch men, then ſo to harden others in impiety. How unworthy was <hi>Judas</hi> of that gracious call he had, when by his ſecret theft and perfidious be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying of Chriſt, he gave him up to be crucified? What ſuch a man to be found in the number of thoſe that left all and followed Chriſt! What a ſcandal was thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

not do ſuch things as ſhall make Religion ſtink in the noſtrils of men: Oh they have alwayes a care to that, that that may be well ſpoken of, may hear well! In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there are paſſive ſcandals and offences, ſuch as wicked men take by their own corrupt and malicious hearts, as the Phariſees did at Chriſt, but thoſe are not to be mattered; ſuch perſons do deſtroy their own ſelves, and like Serpents they turn every thing they eat into poiſon; but we ſpeak now of thoſe things that give a juſt offence, that are not juſtifiable and warrantable. Theſe things, thoſe that deſire to adorn religion will abſtain from. If <hi>Auguſtus</hi> ſaid, That an Emperor was not only to be free from crimes, but alſo from the ſuſpition of them; How much more ſhould Chriſtians, who are commanded to abſtain from all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evil? 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5. 22.</p>

Remember thy Chriſtianity, and that will raiſe up thy heart to things that are indeed glorious and excellent; to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie thy paſſions, to conquer thy luſts, to have fellowſhip and communion with God in holy duties, to be above the allurements or diſcouragements of the world, to fear nothing but ſinne; theſe are magnanimous and generous things, and ſuch only they do, who walk worthy of this calling.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>They walk worthy, who abound in the graces following this verſe:</hi> For the Apoſtle of all other duties, inſtanceth in lowlineſſe and meekneſſe of minde, <note place="margin">5.</note> with all long-ſuffering and forbearance. Lowlineſſe of minde is that humility of heart, whereby we give all to Gods grace, and take nothing to our ſelves, <hi>Praiſe is comely for the upright.</hi> Nothing but grace, grace ſhould come out of the mouth that is thus graciouſly called by God. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> often breatheth out the praiſes of the riches of Gods grace and long-ſuffering, with much patience intreating and exhorting others to come out of their dangerous eſtate they are in. They conſider how much patience God and good men ſhewed to them, how often they were rebellious and refractory, yet God did not leave them. And certainly this is a very great grace, not to be wearied out, but ſtill importuning thoſe that gainſay, if God may yet give them grace to repent.</p>

Whoſe zeal muſt not burn like fire to ſee the reproach and ſcandal to Chriſtianity by the lives of thoſe, who call themſelves Chriſtians, but indeed are not? They have a name that they live, but are really dead. Doth your Chriſtian religion teach you to lie, ſwear, and live in all carnal jollity? Doth the Scripture, doth Chriſt teach you no better things?

                  <p>Secondly, A defiling mixture may be by the inordinate and immoderate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections <note place="margin">2.</note> of a man, even to lawful things; even as the waters that overflow the banks, they get ſoil and filth by that means: So thoſe affections that are carried out beyond their limits, in over-loving, in over-grieving, in over-deſiring, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe and make unholy. Hence <hi>Eſau</hi> is called <hi>A prophane perſon,</hi> Heb. 12. 16. why? we read not of his groſs, vicious, beaſtly ſins, but becauſe be had a low and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing eſteem of heavenly things, of that birth-right he ſold: So then, thou art an unholy and a prophane man, though free from thy groſs ſins, if thy thoughts, thy eſteem about holy and heavenly things be low and careleſs: Thou hadſt rather have, as he ſaid, <hi>Guttam vini,</hi> then <hi>cadum mentis,</hi> a drop of pleaſure, then an whole veſſel of heavenly wiſdom, this argueth thou art unholy. Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lieth in the ſpiritual dieting and moderating of all thy affections to world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comforts: <hi>He that marrieth, as if he married not; he that buyeth, as if he bought not,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. In all our eſtates and conditions, we are to cut off thoſe luxuriant branches, we are to put bounds to them, as God to the ſea, Hitherto thou ſhalt go and no further.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Holineſs is mainly ſeen in referring all unto God by pure and upright in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.</hi> The Phariſees holineſs, though ſo dazling in the eyes of the world, <note place="margin">3.</note> was no holineſs, becauſe they did all to be ſeen of men: This makes all the civil and admirable actions of the Romans, and other Heathens, to be no holy actions,
<pb n="661" facs="tcp:30767:358"/>
but <hi>ſplendida peccata,</hi> becauſe it was vain glory, or at leaſt, the love of their Countrey, that put them upon the accompliſhment of ſuch actions; ſo that the greateſt part of holineſs is inviſible, lieth much in eying at the true aim we ought to ſhoot at. <hi>Jehu</hi> in all thoſe wonderful Reformations he made in the Church and State of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet was not in the number of the holy Kings, becauſe his ends were ſelfiſh, worldly, and vain glorious. Look then thy intentions fall not ſhort of that ultimate end, the glory of God, and this prove a dead flye in the box of thy ointment.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Holineſs lieth in bearing up the heart in all kinde of duties, with ſuch</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>heavenly and ſublime motives, that fleſh and blood can no ways attain unto:</hi> Holineſs is a power above all refined natural abilities: Thus faith is an holy grace, becauſe it beareth up the heart with a promiſe, with the word of God, when all natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſon and hopes are againſt it; and ſo he can rebuke thoſe ſtrong winds and tempeſts of unbelief and diſcouragement, which natural ſtrength could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver do: So to love God in adverſities, not to mutter or repine at him, though his hand be heavy on thee, yet thou haſt no hard thoughts about him, but he is as good and as gracious a God in thy apprehenſion as ever: Here is iron ſwimming, here are the rivers of <hi>Jordan</hi> running back, here is holineſs exalted above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſo likewiſe to rejoyce in tribulations, to triumph over all troubles; to finde honey in the dead carkaſs of the Lyon, to get bread out of ſtones; this is the work of holineſs. And laſtly, patience and forbearance to men that hate us, love and pitty to thoſe that cruelly perſecute us: Thus holineſs teacheth, but the nature of man kicketh againſt all theſe things.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Holineſs is in the dedicating of our ſelves wholly unto the Lord;</hi> that we <note place="margin">5.</note> are no more our own, much leſs the worlds or Satans: Thus there were holy veſſels, and an holy Temple, becauſe altogether ſeparated unto God, and might not be imployed unto any common uſe: Thus the perſons that are holy, <hi>Are made the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. they may not touch any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean thing. Oh what a ſtrong obligation is this, to depart from all evil and wicked company! To whom wert thou given up? Haſt thou not parted with ſelf? and art not thou given to God? Be then as the Temple, let no unclean thoughts or affections paſs through thee.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>A neceſſary Concomitant of this holineſs, is a reverence and aw it breeds</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>in the conſciences, even of thoſe who yet hate it:</hi> As the image of God put in man, made him have dominion over the beaſts of the earth; ſo this holy image of God breeds an aw, a fear even in wicked men: Thus <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is of <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>A Divine nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. and certainly, as the Sun makes a glorious dazling upon the eyes of men; ſo doth holineſs, powerfully expreſſed, make a throne in the hearts of the ungodly, convincing and overawing them: Though therefore out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly they may deride and oppoſe the practice of holineſs, yet in their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences they count ſuch happy, and wiſh their ſouls might be in the ſame condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with ſuch mens.</p>
                  <p>We come in the next place, to the extent of this duty, <hi>In all manner of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The extent of the duty. 1.</note> And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>It muſt be in our converſation,</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Now a mans converſation is not ſome few acts, or ſome few times to be holily affected, but conſtantly and cuſtomarily. <hi>Our converſation is in heaven,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 20. and its called a godly mans way, wherein he walketh; ſo that unleſs holineſs be thy main buſineſs, unleſs Religion be thy chief imployment, thou art not yet holy, thy way is not an holy way, though there may be ſome occaſional holy action; neither is thy converſation an holy converſation, though there may ſeem to be ſome holy fits: Oh this is greatly to be attended unto, for ſome mens holineſs is like the morning dew, or like the ebbings and flowings of the ſea; its by way of
<pb n="662" facs="tcp:30767:359"/>
a tranſient paſſion, not as a permanent principle within them; its a Land-flood that makes a great noiſe, its not a conſtant ſpring.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It muſt be holineſs in all manner of converſation: <note place="margin">2.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, There muſt be all holineſs <hi>ſubjectivé,</hi> that is, all the parts and faculties of ſoul and body muſt have their peculiar holineſs; the minde holy, thoughts holy, meditations holy, the will holy, deſires holy, and holy choices, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections holy, holy love, holy anger, holy grief, holy fear; the memory an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly treaſury to retain holy directions and inſtructions: Thus a mans ſoul muſt be like that part of the Temple, <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum, The holieſt of holies;</hi> the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy likewiſe, that is to be holy inſtrumentally, holy eyes, holy hands, and holy tongues, holy words, holy actions, holy geſtures: That as the Prophet <hi>Zechariah</hi> propheſieth, upon the horſes bells there ſhould be written, <hi>Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> Zech. 14. 21. ſo here upon the whole man ſhall be written, <hi>Holineſs to the Lord;</hi> and the meaning of that propheſie is, That he who is holy, ſhall be in every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect holy; as <hi>Paul</hi> prayeth, <hi>I pray God ye be ſanctified throughout, both in ſpirit, ſoul, and body,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5. 23.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>This muſt be all holineſs</hi> objectivé, <hi>in reſpect of the object:</hi> Our actions muſt be holy in reference to God and man: <hi>I exerciſe my ſelf,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> Acts 24 16. there was his converſation; <hi>to keep a good conſcience towards God and man,</hi> there was the extent to every object; for although all holineſs doth im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately refer to God, yet when we do the duties of juſtice, righteouſneſs and charity towards man, becauſe God commands, and out of love to him, then theſe juſt and righteous actions, are likewiſe holy actions, becauſe of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of God that draweth out the ſoul: So that we may make our very eating, drinking, and lawful refreſhments, holy actions, when a motive from God doth put us upon them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>We are in our converſation to put forth all holineſs, in reſpect of the degrees of it:</hi> We are to endeavor, and to hunger and thirſt after all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees <note place="margin">3.</note> of holineſs; if there be better believing in God, better heavenly minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, more love to God then ever yet we have attained, this we are to preſs forward to; as <hi>Paul,</hi> who was exalted to ſo high a degree of holineſs, yet he forgets all behinde, and purſueth that before, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. as if he were but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to be godly; and hence the godly are ſaid, <hi>To hunger and thirst after righteouſneſſe,</hi> Mat. 5. <hi>Alexander</hi> wept when he heard a Phyloſopher arguing there were more worlds then one, when he had not yet conquered one: And thus when thou heareſt the word of God requiring ſuch a perfect holineſs, ſuch a pure exerciſe of graces, thou mayeſt weep to ſee the droſs, the defects and weakneſſes that are in thee; yet take heed thou doeſt not reject thy holineſs as none at all, becauſe it may be better; for perfection and fulneſs is not in this life, ſtill here is ſomething wanting, but our prayers and endeavors ſhould be after perfection.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>We are to put forth all the parts and kindes of godlineſs in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation:</hi> Holineſs is a chain, and we muſt not break one link: <hi>Adde to faith,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>vertue, and to vertue temperance, &amp;c.</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 6. To be holy in ſome things, and not in others, is to be holy in nothing: Holineſs is univerſal, it comes in with no buts, no ifs or ands, no exceptions; but as the word of God is univerſal, and the rule is univerſal, ſo is his holineſs: Oh its this partial holineſs, this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in ſome pittances, that makes ſuch a reproach to Religion: Holineſs will no more ſwear then lye, or lye then ſwear; Holineſſe will no more deal unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then leave off praying and holy duties; if any do ſo, the Scripture makes not ſuch holy: Oh therefore be ſure to ſtudy the extent and largeneſſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe. Do I ſhew forth all holineſſe? The Apoſtle bids us pray, that under Magiſtrates we might live in all godlineſs: There is ſome holineſs, ſome godlineſs many times the world will ſuffer, but not all: And none would think how falſe and guilful their hearts are, how much they are to ſeek for ſome kinde of godlineſs, when they are put to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="663" facs="tcp:30767:359"/>
Laſtly, <hi>We are to ſhew holineſs at all times in our converſations:</hi> There is no <note place="margin">4.</note> hour, no moment, wherein thou canſt ſay, Now I may not be holy, now its not required I ſhould be holy: So that as wicked men, the imaginations of the thoughts of their hearts are onely evil, and that continually; ſo ſhould ours be holy, and that continually: This is our duty, though in this life it cannot be fully practiſed.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, conſider, <hi>The example of our holineſs;</hi> and that is, <hi>As God</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">
                           <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                        </gap> of holineſs.</note> 
                     <hi>is holy:</hi> Not that we can be infinitely holy, and eſſentially holy, as he is; but to imitate him: So that we muſt not take the world for a rule of holineſs, but God; and we are not required to be Omnipotent as he is, Mighty as he is, but holy as he is. Now the grounds of this are:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>It behoveth a father and a ſon to be of the ſame nature:</hi> A man doth not <note place="margin">Why. 1.</note> beget a beaſt of another nature, but a childe of the ſame being: Thus the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <hi>As obedient children;</hi> and hence they are ſaid to <hi>Be born of God:</hi> How then can ye call God father, who have not the likeneſs of his nature? Is there ſuch ſin and impurity in God, as in thee? Oh tremble at ſuch things! <hi>Gods eyes are purer then to behold iniquity;</hi> ſo let thine be.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Love to God, will put a man upon the immitation of him whom we love:</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> So that ſimilitude, as it is a cauſe, ſo its an effect of love; that as you ſee fire aſſimilates every thing into its own nature, it turneth every thing to fire; ſo love to God, and delight in him, that makes us wholly to become like him. A man that liveth under the torrid Zone, gets a colour from the ſun, which ſhineth ſo hot upon him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>He muſt needs be holy, becauſe elſe we are not prepared for any commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>or fellowſhip with God:</hi> Herein lieth the happineſs of a godly man, that he hath fellowſhip with God, that he enjoyeth his preſence, that he ſeeth his face, as you may ſee it repreſented in the <hi>Canticles:</hi> Now how can this be, when a man is prophane and unholy? Chriſt ſpeaks there of his heavenly love, and ſpiritual imbracements, and how can this be to a ſoul that is loathſom and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely through ſin? God ſpeaks by the Prophet, of the abominable and vile condition of the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in her ſin, wallowing in her blood, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 6. and till he put on comely ornaments on her, ſhe was no fit object of love: <hi>Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low holineſs; without which no man ſhall ſee, enjoy God,</hi> Heb. 12. 14. As the eye di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempered with diſeaſed humors, cannot comfortably behold the ſun, ſo neither can the ſoul, debaſed through ſin, behold the favor of God; yea, as the ſoul is not fit for ſuch communion, ſo the preſence and purity of God, if it ſhould draw near, would be an heavy burthen to a wicked man. Heaven it ſelf, and enjoyment of God, is no ſutable or welcome mercy to a wicked heart: So far as the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſafety and deliverance from hell is in heaven, they can be glad of it; but take the poſitive part of heaven, which is indeed the heaven; <hi>viz.</hi> Injoyment of God, and delighting in him, a wicked man can no more agree with it, then ſoar eyes do abide the dazling ſun.</p>
                  <p>Let us make Application of the point. And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Of Inſtruction:</hi> Is holineſs thus neceſſarily required of every one called <note place="margin">Uſe 1.</note> by God, becauſe he is holy? then to be ſure do not miſtake what true holineſs is; for if thou erre about that, thy deſtruction is irrecoverable, who can help it? Therefore to know what it is, ſtudy and peruſe the Scripture: Oh what an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, ſublime, and accurate thing is that repreſented to be! Will no leſs ſerve then an holineſs in ſome degree (though with vaſt diſproportion) like that of God? What ſhame, what trembling ſhould this work in us? Thou judgeſt of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs according to the principles of the world; and they, when a man is leſs wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, call it holineſs; if there be worſe men in the world, then they bleſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. As in an Hoſpital, the man that is leſs diſeaſed then others, he is judged healthful and ſtrong: This undoeth you, holineſs and godlineſs is made a leſs and more eaſie buſineſs, then the Scripture deſcribeth.</p>

                  <p>THe Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> concludes his Epiſtle with a Petition in this verſe, and a doxology in the next. In the Petition we have theſe parts:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The Object to whom this Petition is addreſſed, <hi>viz. God,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by a glorious property ſutable to the matter of the prayer, <hi>The God of all grace;</hi> he was to pray for grace, and therefore mentioneth the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of grace. This is of great conſolation, the people of God want more and
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:30767:360"/>
more grace, and God is cloathed with allſufficiency: if you want it, you know where to be ſupplied.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God is deſcribed by a gracious effect of this grace, <hi>Who hath called us:</hi> This fountain was not ſealed up, but diffuſeth it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The term to which, of this grace, deſcribed in its nature to be <hi>Glory.</hi> Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſhould lift up their heads at the very hearing of this: and there is the adjunct of it, <hi>eternal glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, There is the meritorious cauſe of this grace, <hi>By Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The matter prayed for, which is in the accumulation of many words together, <hi>Make you perfect, ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen, ſettle you.</hi> Some do curiouſly enquire after a difference between every one of theſe: but I take them to be nothing but the vehement and holy Oratory of <hi>Paul</hi> affectionately expreſſing himſelf in his prayer for them, and they are moſt of them metaphorical words from the Artificer, who is careful to ſettle and eſtabliſh his building. Now by the matter prayed for, <hi>viz.</hi> further perfection and eſtabliſhment in grace, we may ſee even the beſt godly men, do need further addition and ſtrengthning in grace. As he cried out, <hi>O me nunquam ſapientem,</hi> ſo mayeſt thou, <hi>O me nunquam pium,</hi> ſtill there is a further degree in every grace to be obtained. There is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, and there muſt be continual correcting; but this is not the matter I intend, I come therefore to my purpoſed ſubject in this Text; and that is the term to which, of Gods gracious effect mentioned in the Text, <hi>Who hath called us to eternal glory; That which the eye hath not ſeen, nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive;</hi> that we are now to treat of, or rather to ſtammer about, <hi>viz.</hi> that infinite and everlaſting glory which God cals wretched ſinners, but repenting and believing unto. He hath called us into it: This ſheweth how cloſe and intimate that fruition is we have of this glory. It may never trouble a man to part with his beloved luſts and ſins, which are but for a moment, for this eternal glory; it is to part with dirt and dung to have gold and precious ſtones.</p>
                  <p>For the further opening of this you muſt know there is a two-fold end of Gods calling us, the near and proxim one, and that is, Repentance and Faith: So the firſt thing God cals wicked and ſinful men unto, is truly to repent of their ſinne, and ſtedfaſtly to believe in him; But ſecondly, There is the remote and further end, which is Salvation and Eternal Glory. Of this we are to ſpeak at this time.</p>

                     <hi>Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This point certainly may much affect you; for did the Devil think by ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the glory of the world to tempt Chriſt to worſhip him? and ſhall not we by the diſcovery of this heavenly glory, make you fall down and worſhip, and obey God who hath promiſed to give this unto all thoſe that do ſo to him? There is a parallel place, 1 <hi>Theſſ. 2. 12. Who hath called us unto his kingdom and glory.</hi> What un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable condeſcention is this, that God ſhould take us, and put us into a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him of kingdom and glory, to ſet us upon thrones next to Chriſt and him, yet the Scripture doth frequently inſiſt on this glory that God intends to put on thoſe that obey his calling. To open this, if they were ſo many dayes to purify and prepare themſelves for hearing the Law, which was a miniſtration of death, and there was ſuch glory on <hi>Moſes</hi> his face in the delivering of it, that the people could not ſtedfaſtly behold him: Certainly there ought to be more cleanſing and preparing of the ſoul to receive the Doctrine of this Goſpel-glory. We can onely ſhew you the back-parts of it, for we cannot comprehend it in all its fulneſſe, no more then a little ſhell can hold the Ocean.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall firſt ſpeak of the Nature of this Glory, and then the Properties. And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The Nature of it is ſeen in diſcovering the object to be enjoyed by us to all</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">The nature of Glory.</note>
                     <pb n="666" facs="tcp:30767:361"/>
                     <hi>eternity, and that is God himſelf, the perfect, univerſal and ſufficient good.</hi> Our glory is in this, that we enjoy God to all eternity, who is the inexhauſted ſea of all heavenly happineſſe. See how <hi>David</hi> doth triumph in that enjoyment he hath of God in this life, which yet is but the cluſter of grapes to that heavenly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan. Whom have I in heaven but thee, and whom in earth but thee?</hi> Pſal. 73. 25. And in other places, <hi>The Lord is my portion and my inheritance.</hi> So then, if God enjoyed by faith do give ſo great a bleſſedneſs to the ſoul in this life, how much more when he is enjoyed by immediate viſion? This the Scripture cals, <hi>Seeing of God face to face,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 12. So then, herein lieth this unſpeakable glory, that whatſoever goodneſſe, excellency, fulneſſe and bleſſedneſſe is in God, the ſame is communicated unto the glorified Saint according to its capacity. <hi>Deus meus &amp; omnia,</hi> ſaid he: but this will be much more in Heaven, where not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our ſinful, but our animal lives will be ended; <hi>Then ſhall we be with the Lord for ever,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paul,</hi> that is ſpoken, as the compleat perfection of all happineſſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>This glory which may be called formal or ſubjective, as the former ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>lieth in the intellective and affective part of a man cloſing with, and enjoying of God.</hi> When we ſay we are made glorious by enjoying of God, the meaning is, the intellective and affective parts of the ſoul are wholly fixed upon him to their utmoſt deſire and capacity; for the glory of a man muſt conſiſt in his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional part, his underſtanding, will and affections, which are the beſt faculties, muſt be united to the beſt good, in the beſt manner. And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>For the intellectual or knowing part of a man, its plain there can be nothing</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Of knowledge in heaven.</note> 
                     <hi>of this happineſſe, if that be not preſent.</hi> For as of an unknown thing there can be no deſire, ſo neither any love or delight: and the more clear and intuitive this knowledge is, the more is our glory. Now the Scripture ſpeaks, that we ſhall then <hi>ſee him face to face, not as in a glaſſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 13. 12. <hi>We ſhall know him even as we are known of him;</hi> and our glory is expreſſed in this phraſe <hi>To ſee God.</hi> So then, herein will our bleſſedneſſe and glory be, that we ſhall fully and clearly know and behold all the excellency that is in God, all the objects and motives of love and delight. That as the bodily eye deſcrying the pulchritude of a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible object, preſently kindles love in the heart, <hi>Ut vidi perii;</hi> So it is here, The ſoul of a man glorified, beholding all the admirable lovelineſſe and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in God, that holy and pure nature of his, thoſe gracious and free acts of his love to us, is hereupon ſet on fire, and made glorious; That which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle prayeth for us here to attain, will then be compleated, <hi>To know the breadth, and length, and depth of the love of Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Epheſ. 3. 18.</p>
                  <p>Again, This glory lieth in the affective part of the ſoul, whereby it takes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite complacency and delight in God, who is thus made known; and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if good be the object of the will and love, then God being infinitely, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally and in an unlimited manner good; the will and affections of a man muſt needs be drawn out to the full.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>That the ſoul of a man can thus gloriouſly enjoy God, its neceſſary that all the filth and loathſome ſpots of ſinne ſhould be wholly cleanſed away:</hi> For as <note place="margin">3.</note> long as there is any relique of this noiſomneſſe, as it is not fit or ſutable for ſuch a glorious object, as God is; ſo neither hath it compleat and full glory it ſelf. The bloud of Chriſt was ſhed, that we might be without ſpot or wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle, or any ſuch thing; but this lovelineſſe cannot be obtained in this life. Its true, Chriſt in thoſe ſpiritual Songs of <hi>Solomon,</hi> cals his Church, <hi>His Love, his Fair, his undefiled One, that ſhe is altogether Lovely,</hi> but that is meerly becauſe of the lovely Ornaments, and Excellency Chriſt put upon Her. But in Heaven this Lovelineſſe will be inherent, ſhe will have all this Glory inexiſtent, not imputed: Oh then what Tongue can expreſſe the gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſuch a condition, when there ſhall not be the leaſt imperfection, or defect in thy Grace, thy Love perfect Love, thy Delight in God a full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Delight! <hi>Paul</hi> in Heaven doth no longer complain, <hi>When I would do good,
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:30767:361"/>
evil is preſent with me,</hi> Rom. 7. No, his heart is as godly and as holy as he can deſire. This then is the glory that the called ones of God ſhould breath after; when will the time come that all my ſpots and blemiſhes will be done away? I am as yet aſhamed to ſee ſo much droſſe and filth in my ſelf; I bluſh becauſe of my nakedneſſe; but the day is coming, when all things that are imperfect will be done away. This ſhould exceedingly ſupport them for the preſent in their conflicts and combates with ſinne: Oh what ſhall they doe! Their hearts ſuffer violence within them, they are loathſome beaſts in their own eyes; they doe not love to ſee themſelves in the pure Glaſſe of Gods Word. Well, comfort thy ſelf, the time is coming, thy Graces will be made perfect, thy Soul will be glorified with all fulneſſe, not the leaſt ſpot or ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh in it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>This Glory will be in the enlarging and extending of all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>of the Soul to partake of God:</hi> For God being infinite, and the Soul of a limited and finite Nature, hath no proportion till God raiſe and elevate it up to that which of it ſelf it could not doe. Hence the very Soul of an Infant dying a member of Chriſt, and glorified in Heaven, is ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to an actual capacity for the full enjoying of God. The Apoſtle <hi>Hebr.</hi> 12. calls them <hi>The ſpirits of juſt men made perfect.</hi> So that God doth widen and enlarge the Soul of a man, whereby it doth partake of God, and hath communion with him in a more powerful and tranſcendent manner, then of it ſelf it could have.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>This Glory doth not onely ſtay on the Soul, but reacheth to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>alſo.</hi> Which the Scripture 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. and in other places doth often ſpeak of, <hi>Our vile bodies ſhall be made glorious bodies;</hi> That as the Artificer by his Art out of earth can make curious and reſplendent glaſſes, ſo God much more out of the duſt of our bodies, will make immortal, incorruptible and even ſpiritual bodies, as the Apoſtle cals them. The glory of our bodies is, Firſt in the perfection of them; all the Defects, Imperfections, Deformities will then be quite removed. Secondly, In impaſſibility, there will be no pains, no Diſeaſes, no bodily Grief, no Paſſion from, or ſuffering of, any offenſive ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. Thirdly, In Immortality, it will be no more mortal, no more ſubject to fears and pains of Death. And laſtly, In Agility, in quick Motions, <hi>We ſhall be ſnatched up into the Clouds, and be there with the Lord for ever:</hi> Oh who can believe that this vile houſe of clay ſhall ever be made ſuch a golden Palace! who can ever think that ſo much glory ſhould be put upon ſuch veſſels of diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and infirmities?</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>This Glory is not onely thus real and inherent, but it is alſo manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and revealed Glory in the eyes of others;</hi> For Glory is properly <hi>illuſtris</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>&amp; clara notitia,</hi> the knowledge and favour of an excellency, the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it to others; and thus the glory of called perſons will be a known mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted Glory. It will be ſeen by the eyes of the whole world, God will put the Robes and Crown of Glory upon them, in the midſt of all perſons at the Day of Judgement; Lo theſe are the perſons whom I have thus honoured, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels they will bear witneſs of it; The Devils and wicked men condemned, they ſhall ſee it and gnaſh their teeth. Thoſe men whom we ſcorned, derided, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, how doth God honour them? So then, God will hereafter put ſuch viſible glory upon his people, that all the world ſhall be witneſſes of it; <hi>As yet it doth not appear,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Joh. 3. 2. but it ſhall be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.</hi> That as precious jewels have that naturally which covers their excellency, and the choice gold lieth in the earth, and at firſt ſheweth not its full luſtre, till by Art made ſo: So the godly who in this preſent life are deſpicable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely by their weakneſſes, by their afflictions, by the outward meanneſſe of their Condition, will hereafter have all theſe rags pulled off, and the
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:30767:362"/>
day of their glorious Coronation will appear. This is for the Nature of their Glory, and for the Adjuncts and Properties of it they are admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. <note place="margin">The adjuncts and properties of glory. 1.</note>

After thou haſt ſate down and thought, and thought ſtill; Eternity is above thy thoughts. The fear of death is like <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Gourd that eateth up all our outward Glory. You are but glorious Gloe-worms that ſhine for a night; but glorious Flowers that preſently fade: Give me any world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly glory, of which you can ſay, it is eternal, that it is for ever; yea men of the greateſt glory in this world have found it to be like a ſhadow, the longeſt before the night come upon them. King <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his glory was not above a Lilly, and a Lillies glory endureth but for a day, when cropt from its root. The Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture ſaith, <hi>Act. 24. 23.

                     </gap>, it was a great fancy that preſently paſſeth away.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>This Glory is ſpiritual and heavenly as well as viſible.</hi> The glory of <note place="margin">2.</note> the body is indeed viſible, and Heaven is a glorious viſible place, but yet that which is the greateſt glory is ſpiritual, the ſoul made holy and perfect; God who is the object of our glory is inviſible; and although it be diſputed, yet many conclude, that God is not ſeen with the bodily eye there, onely Chriſt becauſe of his humane nature is; So then, the greateſt part of this glory is ſpiritual and holy. And thus it is farre above the glory of the world, which is in outward ſenſible objects, that tend onely to a bodily and carnal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. If the Queen of <hi>Sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>weight:</hi> So that the glory of believers is ſubſtantial and real, it will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly and deeply poſſeſſe the whole man: whereas if you look upon the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward glory of the world, its but a puff, a bladder, an empty nothing. This is a true ſolid glory, which is accepted of by God, to which he giveth his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that it is true; What is it to have glory among men, and to be abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before God? What is it for a while to have external pomp in this world, and then God to raiſe thee out of the duſt to everlaſting contempt and reproach? Thou glorieſt in thy wealth, in thy beauty, in thy honours, but what is this to the glory in Heaven?</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>This is an univerſal and entire glory.</hi> There is nothing of glory <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

No worldly glory did ever ſatisfie a man, no more then the air or the winde will an hungry ſtomack: yet this heavenly glory is ſo perfect and compleat, that there is nothing to marre it, to corrupt it; and it hath this admirable effect that it doth wholly ſatisfie the deſire, and yet excites it to deſire it more: they deſire no other happineſs, no other glory, they are in their centre, yet they are never wearied, as they were of the Manna; but this glory is as admirable, as raviſhing, as ever it was at the firſt moment they enjoyed it. This may be greatly improved practically.</p>

But without any ſtraying, we may thus interpret the Apoſtle, He is blinde, <hi>viz.</hi> abſolutely in reſpect of heavenly things, and although he can ſee thoſe objects that are obvious to ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> all earthly things, yet he hath no perceiving about heavenly things. And indeed its very ſad to conſider how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are eagle-eyed in the matters of the world, and very blinde moles in heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things. The third argument is from the ingratitude ſuch men are guilty of: They have forgotten they were purged from their old ſins; when they undertook the profeſſion of faith in Chriſt, and were baptized, there was Sacramentally, at leaſt, a cleanſing from their former waies of wickedneſſe. Now it would be high ingratitude for any not to preſerve themſelves from ſuch defilements ſtill. Laſtly, Here is another argument for abounding in all grace, which is laid down by way of exhortation: There cannot be any aſſurance had of our calling or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ct on, unleſs we are fruitfull in theſe graces. This ſhould greatly awaken, for it behoveth us above all things in the world to have ſome comfortable knowledge how it ſtands between God and our ſouls.</p>
                  <p>In the words then conſider the duty injoyned, and the way how to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it. The duty injoyned is to make <hi>your calling and election ſure.</hi> Calling, <hi>viz.</hi> the graces of God we are called to in this life, juſtification, adoption, and
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:30767:363"/>
union with Chriſt, as alſo regeneration and ſanctification of our natures, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that is the baſis or the foundation of our calling. But how may we make theſe things ſure? not in themſelves, for the purpoſe of God ſtands firm in its own ſelf. <hi>The foundation of the Lord ſtands ſure,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 19. And the gifts or calling of God are without repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 29. But ſure in reſpect of our ſelves, that we may be upon good grounds confirmed in our own hearts, that we are ſuch whom God hath called or choſen. So that the holy Ghoſt doth here blame all thoſe who put their comforts and hopes upon a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; who maintain doubts and uncertainties in their own ſouls, about their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal condition, that will not ſeek out for comfortable evidences herein. 2. You have the manner how this glorious priviledge may be attained, by giving diligence: <hi>and the rather by giving diligence;</hi> which words do imply, that unleſs we ſet our main thoughts and ſtrength about this matter; unleſſe we care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſet our ſouls to diſtinguiſh between true and falſe, we ſhall never be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded upon good grounds. This text is much vexed in the controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Papiſts and Proteſtants: The Papiſts denying this certainty (unleſs ſome few) and the Proteſtants pleading ſtrongly for it. And this text ſeems to be an impregnable place for aſſurance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That its not only poſſible, but a duty in Chriſtians, to indeavour after an aſſurance</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> 
                     <hi>of their effectuall calling and election.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are not to bring an ill report, as they did about <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſuch Giants and difficulties were in the way, that it could never be conquered; ſo this aſſurance or certainty can never be had, it will breed preſumption, and eat out all humility and godly fear. It is not my intent to enter into the controverſall part, I ſhall only lay down ſome materiall particulars; and then ſhew you what are thoſe things that may beget this aſſurance, thoſe effects that do neceſſarily argue ſuch cauſes. And the rather, becauſe formerly I treated more largely about the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it.</p>
                  <p>To clear the doctrine conſider, Firſt, That when we ſay a believer may and <note place="margin">Some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars to clear the doctrine. 1.</note> ought to be aſſured of his <hi>calling and election, we do not mean as if of his own ſelf he could have this divine perſwaſion.</hi> For then many of Gods own children would never have lain in ſuch uncomfortable deſertions and dark dungeons as they have done, having no light; crying out, they have no certainty, no aſſurance, oh they cannot believe, they cannot finde any comfort, but their hearts are like a barren heath, or a black hell! They cannot, I ſay, of themſelves come to this ſure perſwaſion, but it is the gift of the Spirit of God, <hi>Rom. 8. 16. The Spirit it ſelf beareth witneſſe with our spirit that we are the ſons of God.</hi> So that Divines uſe to ſay, this certainty lieth in a practicall ſyllogiſme, thus, Whoſoever believeth, repenteth, is heavenly minded, is tender about all ſin, Theſe are called and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; But I do ſo, ſaith the gracious heart, inlightned and inabled by Gods Spirit, Therefore I am called and elected. Now this Aſſumption, I do ſo, the heart being blinde or deceitfull, could never truly make, without the help of Gods Spirit. Hence it is called the Spirit of Adoption ſent into our hearts, whereby we cry <hi>Abbafather.</hi> Oh then, till Gods Spirit thus Evangelizeth, as it were, and puts a filiall frame in us, we are afraid of God, our thoughts are ſlaviſh and deſpairing, and we deſire to hide our ſelves from him; but this Spirit of Adoption caſteth out all tormenting fears, and doth inlighten the minde, that we may ſee the good things God hath wrought in us. Hence is that exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not to grieve the Spirit of God, becauſe it ſealeth us to the day of redemption, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. 30. So then, as it is with the colours that are the object of the ſight, though they be never ſo good, and viſible, yet if there be no light, the eye can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee them: Thus it is here; though there be never ſuch excellent graces, and though God hath wrought a wonderfull change in thee, yet thou art not able to ſee it, till the Spirit of God inable thee.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>You are to know, the ſoul of a man being a rational and ſpirituall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>

                     <hi>hath two kinde of acts.</hi> There are firſt the <hi>direct acts</hi> of the ſoul, whereby it is carried out immediatly and directly to ſome object. And there are ſecondly <hi>reflex acts,</hi> whereby the ſoul conſiders and takes notice of what acts it doth. It's as if the eye were turned inward to ſee it ſelf. The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> expreſſeth it fully, <hi>We know that we know,</hi> 1 John 2. 3. So that when we believe in God, that is a direct act of the ſoul; when we repent of ſin, becauſe God is diſhonoured, that is a direct act; but when we know that we do believe, and that we do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, this is a reflex act: Now whether this certainty or aſſurance be a certainty of faith, or of ſenſe, or rather mixed of both, I ſhall not diſpute: To be ſure, it is more then thoſe probable conjectures and meer humane certainty which the Papiſts plead for.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I ſay, <hi>This aſſurance is a priviledge may be had, and it is our ſin if we breath not after it, or do any thing that may juſtly fill our hearts with doubts and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> Yet it is not of abſolute neceſſity to ſalvation: Its not a neceſſary effect of our calling and election at all times, as heat is an inſeparable effect of fire, and light of the ſun. We ſee <hi>David</hi> and Chriſt himſelf in ſuch ſpiritual deſertions, though there was unbelief in <hi>David,</hi> but not any ſin in Chriſt. Faith of adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is many times where this faith of evidence is not. Although therefore it be our great ſin to do thoſe things which may grieve the ſpirit of God, and chaſe away our aſſurance; yet many times the people of God may walk without this comfortable perſwaſion: Yea they may be greatly aſſaulted, as if God had caſt them offfor ever. They may be as <hi>Pauls</hi> fellow-paſſengers in the Ship, who had ſeen no ſun for many daies together. Let not therefore any argue they are not called, not elected, becauſe this is not yet made ſure to them; for many times God works the greateſt certainty out of the moſt perplexing doubts, and the ſhakings of the ſoul make the root faſter.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly; <hi>Neither yet is this aſſurance the Apoſtle preſſeth us unto, ſuch as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no doubts, no temptations or oppoſitions by Satan.</hi> No, as he cried out, <hi>Lord</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>I believe, help my unbelief,</hi> ſo, Lord I am aſſured, yet give me more certainty. When <hi>Nathan</hi> told <hi>David</hi> his ſins were done away, yet he ſtill praieth for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. becauſe guilt and doubts in his ſoul were ready to obſcure and darken his faith: And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> 1 John 3. cals this aſſurance, perſwading of the heart: That doth excellently imply the heart ſenſible of ſin, is full of arguments and cavils, bringeth many ſtrong contradictions againſt the promiſe. Hence the great word that is uſed often to comfort, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for exhortation, becauſe to the grieved and troubled heart for ſin, comfort will not be received but by frequent exhortation. That opinion therefore of having ſuch an aſſurance as to have no doubt, is much to be ſuſpected, as not being of the Spirit of God. For <hi>the fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit,</hi> in all the actions of it. And the devil doth diligently aſſault our comfort and aſſurance. If therefore it be of God, if it be ſpirituall and heavenly, it cannot be but that the heart of a man, and the devil will oppoſe it; preſumption indeed being a ſin of a mans ſelf-flattering heart meets with no contradiction; ſo true is that ſaying of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Divine, <hi>Nulli ſunt magis desperati, quam qui minus ſunt desperantes,</hi> None are more deſperate, then thoſe that are leaſt deſpairing, <hi>viz.</hi> in their own ſelves, though not of the grace of God.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Howſoever in practicall divinity it be diſputed, whether there be not an aſſurance by the immediate teſtimony of the Spirit, <hi>viz.</hi> whether the Spirit of <note place="margin">5.</note> God doth not by immediate revelation perſwade the ſoul of its good condition and intereſt in God; yet I ſhall not touch upon that, but only ſpeak to that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate aſſurance, <hi>viz.</hi> which the Spirit of God works, by the arguing from the effects to the cauſe, from the fruits of grace to the root, and this is not ſubject to ſuch dangerous deluſions, as the former is: for this goeth upon a ſure ground, the fruits of mortification, and vivification; and the Apoſtle plainly meaneth this aſſurance, <hi>viz.</hi> by adding one grace to another, and by abounding in the fruits of
<pb n="673" facs="tcp:30767:365"/>
holineſſe, ſo they ſhall make their calling and election ſure.</p>
                  <p>In the next place let us conſider what are thoſe effects of grace, which if a man walk in, he may be partaker of this priviledge: not but that God by his abſolute ſoveraignty, and for holy ends, may leave the moſt exact and circumſpect Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in darkneſſe, without any light; as it was in <hi>Job:</hi> And the Prophet inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth, <hi>Who is among you that ſeareth God, and hath no light, walking in darkneſs? Iſa.</hi> 50. 10. One that feareth God, and is precious to God, may walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, having no light, and all that he can do is to ſtay his ſoul on God by a meer act of recumbency, not of any aſſurance at all. This God may do; but yet there are particular waies, which if walked in, God may give thee this white ſtone, as it is called, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. 17. Thou ſhalt walk as one acquitted from thy ſin, and no man can tell what it is thou feeleſt, but thy ſelf only.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, <hi>We muſt give all diligence and heed to the obtaining of this priviledge.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Effects of grace, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving which a Saint may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Aſſurance. 1.</note> We muſt make it our buſineſſe, it muſt be importunately begged for in praier. Thus the text, <hi>The rather give all diligence;</hi> neglect not this, whatſoever thou paſſeſt by. Now it is no wonder that naturall men they look on it as a matter not to be regarded; becauſe they have never been wounded with ſin, they have alwaies had a ſelf-fulneſs, a ſelf-righteouſneſs, and by this means have not breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and thirſted after this aſſurance; <hi>Qui nil dubitat, nil diſcit;</hi> he that never doubts will never learn: And ſo he that hath not been in the depths of Gods diſpleaſure for ſin, he that hath not felt his frowns and his anger, he never comes to think, oh what a bleſſed and happy thing it is to be truly aſſured of the grace of God! that I am ſuch an one to whom the Covenant of grace belongs! a childe to whom the bread of the promiſe appertaineth, and not a dog! Hence therefore it is that men ſit down without this priviledge, they do not look at it as a great mercy; they do not prize it above all other things; and therefore they do not, becauſe they were never ſenſible of the want of it. They never lay wounded with ſin, they never were amazed at the hypocriſie and unſoundneſs of their hearts; They never felt themſelves dropping as it were into hell; and hereupon they give no diligence for this aſſurance. You ſee in earthly things, how carefull men are to make all their bargains ſure; in all purchaſes to make their evidences ſure: Poor men think they are undone, if they loſe their evidences about an earthly inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and never think themſelves miſerable, though they have no true ground or evidence for their ſpirituall condition.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The way to obtain this aſſurance is a fruitfull, fervent and active walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in all the waies of holineſſe.</hi> If theſe things be in you and abound, ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle. <note place="margin">2.</note> The ſparks that are ready to go out, do hardly evidence there is any fire. We doubt of life when we feel ſcarce any breath; and thus it is here; The more remiſs, and negligent, and lazy thou art in the waies of godlineſſe, the leſſe cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty muſt needs be in thee: And the reaſon is plain; for if graces exerciſed be the ſign or ſeal, then the more theſe appear, the more thriving and flouriſhing they are, the ſurer teſtimonies there will be of thy calling and election. When the Church was lazy and negligent, ſhe loſt the comfortable preſence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Chriſt. The ſtanding pools, and ſluggiſh waters, they beget the croking frogs: And thus he who prayeth, as if he praied not; believeth, as if he believed not; this man takes the way to have wounds and blows; and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of tormenting fears in his heart. Though grace exerciſed be not the cauſe or merit of thy ſalvation, yet it is an infallible ſign of thy ſalvation; As the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow is not a cauſe but a ſign that God will never drown the world. Hence <hi>Paul</hi> argueth from his fervency in grace to aſſurance, <hi>I have fought a good fight; hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth is laid up for me a crown of glory,</hi> 2 Tim. 49, 10. <hi>I have fought a good fight:</hi> Chriſtianity was a real combate with ſin; with the world, and all oppoſition; and he had not been idle or cowardly, but alwaies upon his watch, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had this comfortable perſwaſion. So that nothing will darken thy ſoul, more then dull, lazy and negligent walking. When thou abateſt or decaieſt in
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:30767:366"/>
thy graces, theſe tend to make a ſad diviſion between God and thy ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Another way to preſerve or obtain this aſſurance, is, <hi>humility and meekneſſe, going out of our ſelves, avoiding all preſumption, all ſelf-righteouſneſſe.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> Thus the Apoſtle, <hi>Work out your ſalvation with fear and trembling,</hi> Phil. 2. 12. That is, with exceeding great humility and debaſement of your ſelves. So that true aſſurance is ſo far from nouriſhing carnall preſumption and ſinfull confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that it is built upon the clean contrary, holy fear and trembling; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they be aſſured of grace in them, yet they do not truſt in this grace. Theſe two things differ as much as heaven and hell. <hi>Paul</hi> who was ſo highly aſſured that nothing could ſeparate him from the love of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. And ſpeaking of Chriſt, he ſaith, <hi>Who loved me, and gave himſelf for me,</hi> Gal. 3. yet this <hi>Paul</hi> would not be found in his own righteouſneſſe, but in that of Chriſts by faith. So then the godly rejoyce to ſee ſuch teſtimonies and arguments of grace in themſelves, but they put no confidence in them: They repent with an holy fear and trembling: They pray, they hear with an holy fear and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>This aſſurance is obtained and preſerved by a tender watchfulneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all known ſin.</hi> For it being ſin only that ſeparates between God and the ſoul, <note place="margin">4.</note> this only raiſeth up the great gulf; therefore all witting and willing allowing of this, is a direct deſtroier of all aſſurance: And herein this holy certainty is expreſly diſtinguiſhed from all carnall preſumption, which makes a man have confidence and boldneſſe, though in the conſtant cuſtom of all groſſe and foul ſins. They can live in all uncleanneſſe, in all luſts of the fleſh, in all contempt and neglect of God and his worſhip, and yet have as vehement perſwaſions that their hearts are good, and that Chriſt will ſave them, as if they committed no ſuch ſin; oh therefore that way might be made for Chriſt by throwing away all ſuch dangerous concluſions! <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> And the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, <hi>If our hearts condemn us not, we have boldneſſe with God,</hi> 1 John 3. There is no mans heart, but it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth him for many defects, and ſeverall failings; but he ſpeaks of a condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning for the willing practice of known ſins. No marvell then, if thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaineſt thou haſt no aſſurance, thou haſt no certainty; for as long as there are theſe deſperate venturings upon ſin, it cannot be but continuall quakings ſhould be upon thee. If <hi>Cain</hi> carry about with him guilt in his conſcience, no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if he fear every thing will deſtroy him. <hi>David</hi> could have no peace in his bones, while any ſin lay unconfeſſed and unforſaken.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Another way to obtain this is, <hi>To take heed of grieving the Spirit of God or quenching the motions of it.</hi> For ſeeing it's the Spirit of God that <note place="margin">5.</note> witneſſeth, and it is the Spirit that ſealeth, If we would have aſſurance, we are to nouriſh it, to do nothing that may reſiſt and repell it. His office is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and to bring gladneſſe into the heart. Now if thou either by rebelling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the motions of it, or by deſpairing thoughts, reject this Comforter; thou takeſt the ready way to make thy ſelf an undone man. Know then that as you are to hearken to Gods Spirit convincing of ſin, and ſanctifying the nature, ſo alſo ſealing and witneſſing unto them the love of God. Though the Spirit of God moved upon the waters at firſt, and ſtill doth on godly ſorrow, yet not on ſorrow unbelieving, deſpairing, and accompanied with hard thoughts of him.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, If thou wouldſt attain to this aſſurance, <hi>Acquaint thy ſelf well with the Covenant of the Gospel, with the precious promiſes revealed there, with the gracious</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>condeſcentions of Gods love in Chriſt.</hi> Many of the children of God are kept in a doubtfull and perplexed eſtate, becauſe they conſider not the riches of Chriſts grace revealed in the Goſpel; They judge unbelief and doubting even a kinde of a duty, and that to do otherwiſe were arrogance. As <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, His ſoul hated that word Repent all the while he was a Papiſt, becauſe he thought there
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:30767:366"/>
was nothing in it, but bitter ſorrow and terror about ſin; whereas when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Evangelical nature of it, and that it was to be accompanied with faith <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Chriſt; and that nothing was more acceptable unto God, then believing in him, and to have good thoughts of him as a father; then the word he did run from, as <hi>Moſes</hi> from the ſerpent, he took up and imbraced.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe of ſevere Reproof,</hi> of that horrible, prophane, and ſupine negligence of <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> moſt men in this point: Who giveth all diligence to make their calling and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation ſure in their own conſciences? who doth not put it upon a venture? who doth not truſt all upon miſerable uncertainties? They that in matters of eſtate by the Law, or in matters of their health by phyſick, will be ſure to go upon good ground: In the matters of Religion they never enquire, they never ſeek to ſearch out things; Oh we would think, that Religion and a godly fear ſhould make thee of no reſt in thy bones, till thou knoweſt in what condition thy ſoul ſtands in towards God: Haſt thou never heard, <hi>That the heart is deceitful above all things;</hi> it will tell thee, thou doeſt repent, when thou doeſt not; that thou loveſt God, when thou doeſt not; And wilt thou ſtill put off all to this, If I be ſaved, I be ſaved, if damned, I am damned.</p>

I know the promiſes are true and good, it is without all queſtion, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth and repenteth, he ſhall be ſaved;</hi> he that is born of God, and effectually <note place="margin">Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance.</note> called, he may conclude, <hi>I am my Beloveds, and my Beloved is mine;</hi> but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I do ſo or no, there is my perplexity: The heart is full of guile, and we read of <hi>Ahabs</hi> humiliation, of the fooliſh Virgins, of the ſtony and thorny ground, ſuch who had ſome affections and delight in holy things, ſome ſorrow and humiliation about ſin; yet for all that, their own hearts deceived them, their gold proved droſs, they took <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> for Chriſt, ſome imperfect diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, for the compleat and effectual workings of grace; and why may not I delude my ſelf? and the rather, becauſe every one is apt to flatter himſelf: We ſee all people, that are indeed far enough from the Kingdom of heaven, between whom and godlineſs there is a great gulf; yet peremptorily conclude, All is well with them: So true is that of <hi>Solomon, Every mans way is pure in his own eyes;</hi> but then that which followeth ſhould make all tremble, <hi>But God pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the heart,</hi> Prov. 21. 2.</p>
                  <p>This is very ſpecious, and ſo far this Objection hath ſtrength, that no man <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> ſhould eaſily and ſpeedily perſwade himſelf that all is well with him: That thoſe duties of ſearching and trying the heart, and communing with our own ſelves privately, are again and again to be practiſed by us; but yet the Doctrine of the hypocriſie and deſperate guile of the heart overthroweth not this Scripture-cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. And before I give you the reaſon of that, I ſhall ſet down ſome argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments briefly, out of Scripture and Reaſon, that prove the poſſibility, and then anſwer that; for let it once be manifeſted by Scripture, that ſuch a thing may be, then we are not to regard a thouſand Objections that may be made to the contrary.</p>
                  <p>Now the grounds for the poſſibility of it, may be taken from theſe general <note place="margin">Grounds for the poſſibility of aſſuranc. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>1</note> heads:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The Scripture requiring this of us:</hi> God would not put us upon ſuch a ſearch, if to finde had been impoſſible; for beſides this Text, which ſeems to ſpeak this truth in the Sun beams, <hi>Give all diligence to make your calling ſure;</hi> if certainty hereof had been impoſſible, might not any one ſtand up and ſay, This is to command one to give all diligence for that which cannot be? I may be as well required to touch the heavens with my hands, or to remove the earth from its center? Beſides this (I ſay) I ſhal name you one impregnable place, which hath ſtood like a rock, that all the Popiſh Engins have not been able to ſtir, 2 <hi>Cor. 13. 5. Examine your ſelves, &amp;c.</hi> where you have the duty required, <hi>To examine, to prove our ſelves,</hi> as the Artificer doth his mettal, to ſee whether it be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit or true, ſo the Greek word ſignifieth; and thus they are to do to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: And he ingeminates the duty, to ſhew his earneſtneſs and affection therein. 2. There is the object matter of this duty, <hi>Whether ye be in the faith, whether Chriſt be in ye;</hi> that is, whether ye be effectually called or no; and he brings a reaſon from an abſurdity, <hi>If you do not know Chriſt is in you, ye are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates:</hi> As we uſe the Engliſh word, it may ſeem harſh, but the Greek word is no more then unskilful in minde, not able to diſcern: So that reprobate is not here taken for one that is not elected, but for one that is fooliſh, weak, unskilful, as the Scripture ſpeaks of reprobate ſilver: ſee more of this in the firſt Sermon. So that you ſee the Apoſtle makes it an ignorant and weak unskilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the ways of God, and in the work of grace, when we are not able thus to diſcern our ſelves. So then, let this Text put it out of all queſtion; for when the Apoſtle commanded the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to make this proof and examination, had the thing been impoſſible to be found out: It would have been as abſurd, as for a Phyſitian to come to a diſeaſed perſon, and tell him, he cannot be cured, unleſs he eat of a Phenix, or uſe the Philoſophers ſtone, which haply can never be found out.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, A ſecond general ground is, <hi>From the peculiar office and work at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note>

                     <hi>to Gods ſpirit;</hi> and that is, to witneſs with our ſpirit, to ſeal unto us; Its the ſpirit of Adoption, ſubduing thoſe tormenting and ſlaviſh fears about God, which make the ſoul ſuſpect every thing, and to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oſſed up and down like the uncertain waves, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 12. We have received the ſpirit of God, that we might know the things that are freely given us of God;</hi> eſpecially that is clear, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3. 24. So then in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s doubt, we muſt attend to a greater cauſe then our own hearts, we muſt conſider, what great things that ſpirit of God can do in our ſouls: No man naturally can hate his ſin, can deny himſelf, yet the ſpirit of God ſanctifying, he is ready and willing in the work: So no man ſeeing the horrible depths of wickedneſs in his own heart, can ever come to be perſwaded; but the ſpirit of God can rebuke theſe waves and tempeſts, and make all ſerene and clear in the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>The third general head is, <hi>From thoſe places where the people of God have plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>declared their aſſurance:</hi> That therefore which the children of God have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unto, muſt needs be poſſible, and we ought to immitate them in. <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> is without queſtion in this point, 2 <hi>Kings 20. 3. Remember how I have walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart:</hi> He doth not ſpeak this arrogant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but humbly, making uſe of his ſincerity, as a teſtimony to confirm him in his prayer to God. Now <hi>Hezekiah</hi> could not make uſe of ſuch an Argument as this, had he not been aſſured, that he was not deceived in what he uttered to God: And thus <hi>David</hi> is often in his <hi>Pſalms,</hi> profeſſing his love to God with his whole heart, and the uprightneſs of his heart, which had been a vain brag, and ſinful oſtentation, if he had not known it had been ſo. In the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Paul</hi> is often ſpeaking of his aſſurance and confidence; and leſt it might be thought he had this by immediate revelation, he ſpeaks as in the perſon of all believers, <hi>The ſpirit witneſſeth with our ſpirit,</hi> Rom. 8. and ſo <hi>Iohn, We know that we know,</hi> 1 John 2. He doth not make this a peculiar priviledge vouchſafed to ſome favorites, but ſuch a mercy as all Believers are capable of. So when our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour asked ſome, <hi>If they did believe with their whole heart;</hi> it had been a vain queſtion, to which no man could have returned any anſwer, if they could not be certain whether they did believe or no; and that man, who ſaid, <hi>Lord I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, help my unbelief:</hi> He ſhewed the certainty he had of his faith in the firſt place, as the weakneſs of it in the latter.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, The general head I ſhall end with is, <hi>the joy and thankfulneſs that</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">4.</note> 
                     <hi>ought to be in the people of God:</hi> Now what joy can there be, where the ſoul knoweth not, or doubteth much of Gods love? How can the heart be inlarged to praiſe God, for thoſe ſpiritual mercies, which findes them not in its ſelf? For joy, the children of God are ſaid <hi>To joy in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Rom. 14. 17. and its called <hi>Unſpeakable joy, full of glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 8. And can this be in a matter that we know not whether it be ours or no? Can we joy in the promiſe, and yet doubt whether it be ours? Can we rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, and yet queſtion whether he dyed for us? And ſo its for praiſe and thankfulneſs, Can any man bleſs God for tranſlating him out of darkneſs into light, for working the fear of him in his ſoul, for the wonderful and mighty change he hath made on his heart? Can the ſoul bleſs and praiſe God, when he doth not think God hath indeed done theſe things for him? Theſe general heads may ſuffice, to clear the poſſibility of it.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall give you alſo a Reaſon for it, which is this, <hi>Supernatural habits or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of grace, do vitally and evidently diſcover their actions and effects, as ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and animal principles:</hi> As the principle of love to God, of repentance for ſin, do in the acts thereof manifeſt themſelves ſpiritually, as rational principles: So that as a rational man, he knoweth the arguments he hath, he diſcerneth his acts of reaſon, he can tell you he is of this judgement, and not of that: Thus it is with a ſpiritual man, he perceiveth the faith in him, the love of God that is within him: Can the Animal lover finde ſenſible love burning within? and
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:30767:368"/>
doth not the ſpiritual lover feel ſuch fire in his bones? Doth not <hi>David</hi> cry, <hi>That his ſoul breatheth and longeth for God?</hi> Doth not the Church cry out, <hi>She is ſick of love?</hi> So then, ſupernatural principles acting in the ſoul, are perceived ſpiritually, as rational acts are, or ſenſible acts are. As <hi>Austin</hi> ſaid, He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, findeth he doth believe; <hi>viz.</hi> Gods ſpirit aſſiſting him; otherwiſe, like <hi>Hagar,</hi> there may be a pleaſant fountain of refreſhment hard by, and ſhe not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, till her eyes be opened: What then ſhould be the cauſe that men may think this certainty impoſſible? This may ariſe from three grounds:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>When we take no effects of grace to be ſure ſigns, unleſs they be perfect and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Why men think this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taintie impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>compleat:</hi> And this is very often a deceit, even to good and tender hearts; they do not love God, they are not ſo heavenly minded, ſo zealous; they have often failings, they have daily infirmities: And thus, becauſe they have not perfect workings of grace, they doubt of any grace at all; but then <hi>Hezekiah, Paul,</hi> and all the worthies of God, who enjoyed this priviledge, ſhould have been ſtripped of it, for at the ſame time they complain of the remainder of their corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, they feel thorns and goads in their ſide: So great a matter is it to make a difference between truth of grace in the Eſſence, and perfection in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees.</p>
                  <p>Another ground may be, <hi>Becauſe men for the moſt part keep at a remote diſtance</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>from God:</hi> They are not diligent and conſtant in ſpiritual duties and approaches to God: Thus becauſe they draw not nigh to God, God draweth not nigh to them; becauſe they are eſtranged from God, God is alſo from them: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we did take the Scriptures counſel, To walk with God, and to acquaint our ſelves with God, which is done by lively meditation, and quickned duties of Religion, we ſhould then finde that from God, which we thought impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: You ſee the effects of all acts are thought impoſſible, to thoſe that have no skill therein: And thus it is here Aſſurance is a myſtery, and impoſſibility to thee, becauſe thou haſt no familiar acquaintance with God; thou comeſt not into his preſence often, thou delighteſt not to draw nigh to him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, One main cauſe of this uncertainty, is alſo, <hi>A nouriſhing a ſervile ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>fear about God; not praying for the ſpirit of Adoption, and a filial Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal frame of heart:</hi> This is greatly to be attended unto by timorated conſciences, ſuch as are ſhaken with fear and terror for ſin; <hi>Nunquam ſatis cavent etiam cum cavent,</hi> they diſtinguiſh not between <hi>Timor ſolicitudinis,</hi> and <hi>Timor anxietatis,</hi> A fear of godly care and diligence, and a fear of perplexing anxieties: Oh this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times is a labyrinth that good people are in; their hearts are not directed into the way of believing, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 5. they fear God as an auſtere Maſter, watching the opportunity to damn them; they have not the reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial fear of a father, which is accompanied with faith and love of God: Thus <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Iudas,</hi> they did ſplit their ſouls upon this rock, they were terrified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their ſins, horror had taken hold of them, becauſe of the wretched con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they were in; but they had not faith in God as a father, which would have been the clue of thred to have helped them out of their diſtreſs: Oh then do not delight in thy bondage diſpoſition; do not look upon God with a ſlaviſh fear; this will breed hatred at laſt, <hi>Odirunt dum metuunt,</hi> and hatred blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming deſpair: Theſe things diſpatched, I come to Anſwer the firſt Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The heart of man is deceitful,</hi> its ſuch a deep we cannot fathom: <hi>Who can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Object.</note> 
                     <hi>his errors?</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Cleanſe me from ſecret ſins,</hi> Pſal. 19. 13. There may be a great deal of unknown wickedneſs in me, ſuch pride, ſuch earthlineſs, ſuch unbelief, that I never can underſtand.</p>
                  <p>To this I Anſwer, <hi>That though a man may be deceived in his judgement about himſelf, yet it doth not follow, that he is always</hi> defacto <hi>deceived:</hi> We ſay, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <note place="margin">Anſw.</note> Councels may erre, yet they did not always <hi>defacto</hi> crie, ſo it may fall out, that a man in judging about himſelf may be deceived, but that he is in every
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:30767:368"/>
act deceived, this would bring groſſe Scepticiſm into the world; no man could tell his own thoughts, his own affections, and there could not be ſuch a thing as Truth in the world. Now the Scripture ſpeaks the contrary, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 11. What man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of a man within him?</hi> So that you ſee, a man may know the things of his own ſpirit. Again, if this were ſo, then no man could diſcern his Dogmatical faith, as well as his ſaving faith; no man could tell whether he were a Proteſtant or a Papiſt, or a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinian; for the heart being deceitful, as is objected, I may think I believe ſuch a point, and ſuch a point, when indeed I do not; and ſo the Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical doubting ſhall come in, Nothing is known, and nothing is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</p>
                  <p>But the ſecond and full Anſwer is, <hi>That indeed the heart is naturally deceitful,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>full of guile and hypocriſie, but when its ſanctified and converted, its made ſincere and upright:</hi> Its no longer as thoſe pictures that repreſent at a diſtance ſuch and ſuch different Forms, but as a glaſs, ſincerely repreſenting the form of the viſage, if deformed, deformed, if comely, comely: Thus <hi>Nathaniel</hi> is ſaid to be a man, in whom was no guile; and, <hi>Bleſſed is the man,</hi> Pſal. 32. <hi>to whom the Lord imputeth no ſin, and in whoſe heart there is no guile:</hi> Hence its called <hi>An upright heart, A ſincere heart,</hi> and, <hi>Truth in the inward parts:</hi> Although therefore there are ſome reliques of guile and hypocriſie in the godly, as of all other ſins, yet for the main they are made ſincere; and ſo all that ſelf flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, and ſelf-love, is for the main crucified: And this indeed is the full An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to that Objection.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Whereas it is ſaid to be a duty, to this it may be Objected: <note place="margin">Object.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this Aſſurance would prove a dangerous temptation, men would grow ſecure, and carnally confident; therefore as God keeps the hour of death, and the day of judgement, to maks us always prepared; ſo by the ſame Reaſon, he ſhould keep the knowledge of our condition from our eyes, that ſo we might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways fear.</p>
                  <p>To Anſwer this practical Objection (for I avoid all ſpeculative and meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſal ones.) <note place="margin">Aneſw.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>If the truth of God and the Scripture is not to be maintained or aſſerted, becauſe the corruption of men will abuſe it, we muſt preach no divine truth at all; E vero non niſi verum, E bono non niſi bonum,</hi> No good or ſound truth doth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce as its genuine effect, any other then what is good; but by accident, and by reaſon of the poyſonous diſpoſition in ſome men, they will turn the ſweeteſt flowers into poyſon: <hi>Paul</hi> did frequently preach the grace of God in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and ſome hearers turned this into wantonneſs, ſhall therefore no mention be made of this grace? if therefore ſome men, through Satans deluſions, think they have grace, when they have not, ſhall not he that hath true grace be perſwaded of it? if a man in a dream do verily think he hath ſuch riches, ſuch honors; ſhall we conclude, that a man awake can have no certainty whether he be in a dream or no? And further, by this reaſon no man ſhould contend earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly for the true Doctrine of faith; no man ſhould inſeparably adhere to the truth of God even unto death, becauſe an Heretique who pertinaciouſly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth a damnable hereſie, he may be as confident as the Orthodox man: Should not the Iſraelites make a good uſe of the Manna, becauſe he that abuſed it, found it corrupted to worms.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, This Doctrine from its own nature, cannot bread any arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, or neglect of God and godlineſs for many Reaſons:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Its onely maintained and kept up by humility and holy fear: So that when a man ceaſeth to be humble, to have an holy fear of God, his certainty likewiſe ceaſeth, even as the lamp goeth out when the oyl is taken away: <hi>The ſecret of the Lord is with them that fear him,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 25. 14.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="680" facs="tcp:30767:369"/>
Secondly, It cannot breed arrogancy, for theſe exerciſes of grace, are onely ſigns and teſtimonies of Election or Salvation, they are no cauſes of it, or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; wherein then can the ſoul be puffed up. And</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Theſe gracious effects that are ſigns, they are not of our working, by our free-will and power of nature: <hi>We are his workmanſhip created to good works,</hi> Epheſ. 10. So that the diſcovery of theſe effects, may indeed inlarge the ſoul much to praiſe and glorifie God, but to ſtir up pride in us, there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence at all. And</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Theſe very effects of grace, though not wrought by us, but by God, they are not purely good and perfect, there is much droſs, and many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections in them: So that the godly heart doth at the ſame time rejoyce and debaſe its ſelf; it rejoyceth to ſee the love of God in the ſoul, but that this love is ſo weak, ſo languid and fainting, it doth alſo grieve: It diſcovers grace indeed, and therefore is aſſured; but it diſcovers alſo thouſands of failings and imperfections, and therefore is laid low: And yet further, though they be in the heart, yet of our ſelves we have not eyes to diſcern what God hath wrought for us, till he inable us; ſo that its Gods gift to be aſſured: How many dear children of God walk in darkneſs, and would give a whole world if they had it, but to have this clear evidence of Gods love to them, though for a day.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe of further Exhortation,</hi> to prove and examine your ſelves, whether thoſe <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> viſible characters of Chriſt be in thee, or the marks of the Devil: See what fruit ye bring forth, and then you may judge whether you are trees for eternal burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or no: Oh its a ſign all is not well, when thou art unwilling to put thy ſelf upon the touchſtone; its an argument there is guilt within, thou ſhalt finde thy ſelf to be ſuch an one as thou art afraid to think of; thou thinkeſt, If certainty be onely had in the uſe of ſuch means; then farewell my hopes, my evidence for heaven. Oh! who ſayeth as <hi>David, Prove me, O Lord, and examine me, if there be any evil in me.</hi> And to all the former means, we may adde one main one, which is a ſign that never faileth, If we love the brethren, if we love and delight in thoſe that are godly; as <hi>Davids</hi> delight was in the Saints of the earth: He that is not godly himſelf, cannot heartily love one that is godly, becauſe ſimilitude is both a cauſe and an effect of love; and this is, when god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs is the cauſe of love, not his riches, his parts, his love to thee, but the holy image of God appearing in him.</p>

The wife, the childe, the more they know they are beloved of husband or father, the more this inflames them. Love is fire, and fire turneth all things into fire. Thus <hi>David,</hi> when he could ſay, God had forgiven his iniquities, and healed his diſeaſes, in particular; Then <hi>bleſſe the Lord, O my ſoul, and all within me praiſe his holy Name,</hi> Pſal. 103. 1. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 6. what puts him into thoſe extaticall raptures, and tranſcendent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions about God and Chriſt, but the aſſurance that he was ſuch an one whom God had elected, called and juſtified? Oh then, know all the while thou haſt doubtings and ſervile fears upon thee, ſo long thy love to God is very imperfect and cold. The fear of God brings hatred and weariſom thoughts of God: And hence the Apoſtle ſheweth, that fear, <hi>viz.</hi> ſlaviſh, hath a torment with it; and that love caſteth out this tormenting fear, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4 18. Love to God as a gracious Father, would allay all thoſe tempeſtuous and ſwelling waves that are in the ſoul. Now this can never be done, but by ſome certainty that we are ſuch whom God loveth. <hi>Tranquillus Deus, tranquillat omnia;</hi> when we know God is pacified, then the ſoul is alſo pacified. As it's with the ſea, that is quiet as long as the air and windes from above are quiet and ſtill; ſo it is here; The ſoul, that is calm, comfortable and gracious, all the while it can by aſſurance enjoy Gods favour. Now if we cannot ſo vigorouſly love God, while we are without this certainty, how ſhould this provoke us to indeavour after it!</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Certainty of our calling and election will breed much ſpirituall ſtrength</hi>

<pb n="682" facs="tcp:30767:370"/>
holineſſe and lively vigour.</hi> For fear which is the oppoſite to this, that makes weak hands, and feeble knees, that diſheartens, that ſaith, <hi>A lion is in the way:</hi> whereas the certainty of our good condition would put hope and life into us. The teſtimony of a good conſcience made <hi>Paul</hi> ſo active in the courſe of his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. Certainty breeds joy, and the <hi>joy of the Lord is our ſtrength,</hi> as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſaid, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8. 10. Take a piece of timber full of moths and worms eating into it, and it's no waies ſtrong enough for any building. Grief is made rottenneſſe to the bones, which conſumes the ſeat of all our ſtrength: ſo ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall dejections and ſinfull doubtings about the work of grace in us, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the very heart, they deſtroy the very foundations. No man but a ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man can have a good conſcience in a Scripture ſenſe; they may have a quiet conſcience, not accuſing them for groſſe ſins committed againſt the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: But this is not a Scripture good conſcience; for that is freed not only from groſſe ſins, but heart-ſins, and ſoul-ſins, and it is ſprinkled with the bloud of Chriſt. And thus a good conſcience is a continuall feaſt. Oh then, this ſhould ſtir thee up for this holy certainty; thou wilt be farre more chearfull, more joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the work of the Lord: Thou wilt be more fervent and zealous; thou wilt be as the ſun, like a giant running his race. We complain of our barrenneſs, of our weakneſs, of our ſlothfulneſs: What can be wings to us but this certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our gracious eſtate, This will be like the Spirit in <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Wheels. This will be like the winde that gathered the dry bones together. Oh then that the people of God would more matter this. Thou couldſt not be ſuch a lump of earth, if this breath of life were breathed into thee.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>This certainty and aſſurance of grace, would exceedingly keep up the heart under all afflictions and outward miſeries.</hi> Had not <hi>Paul</hi> been aſſured of that <note place="margin">3.</note> eternall weight of glory, he could not have judged theſe worldly miſeries light and eaſie. When <hi>David</hi> was in all that miſery, all outward hopes gone, <hi>He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged himſelf in his God,</hi> 1 Sam. 30. 6. <hi>His God,</hi> He knew God was his God, though he had loſt all things elſe. And thus <hi>Paul</hi> is more then a conquerour; and doth ſo highly challenge all troubles to hurt him if they can, becauſe he knoweth by Gods Spirit, that he is one called and choſen; and ſhall not this prevail with you? Is it not a miſerable thing to fear to be killed by men, and to be damned by God at the ſame time: To be impriſoned by men, and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in thy own conſcience, Oh what will provoke thee if not this? Alas! I am ſure of nothing, not of my life, not of my outward comforts, not of any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward injoyment, and wilt not thou then be ſure of grace within thee? Oh our vanity! when will we be wiſe? We labour for thoſe earthly things, which when we have, we cannot be ſure off, but not at all for grace. Is it not with many men, as with the bees, when all the ſummer they have laboured to fill their combs with hony, then comes the husbandman and burneth them, and takes their hony. So thou haſt a long while laboured to get up ſo much wealth, ſuch an eſtate, and then comes death, or ſome ſudden publique judgement, the ſword and warre, and that takes all thy hony from thee. Oh when we can be ſure of no outward thing we have, let us be ſure of inward grace.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>This certainty of grace is a ſtrong and mighty buckler againſt all thoſe violent aſſaules and temptations, that the devil uſeth to exerciſe the godly with.</hi> His <note place="margin">4.</note> temptations are, That they are hypocrites, that all the calamities which fall upon them are becauſe God is not reconciled with them, that they ſeek themſelves and not the glory of God. Now there is no ſuch brazen wall to repell all his darts, as the teſtimony and knowledge of the truth of grace in our hearts. This was the <hi>aqua vitae,</hi> that kept up <hi>Job.</hi> You know what fiery temptations he had, God ſeemed to be againſt him; godly friends judged him an hypocrite: The devil he aſſaults him; he ſaith, <hi>Doth Job ſerve God for nought?</hi> God hedgeth him in, and giveth him outward proſperity; no wonder then if <hi>Job</hi> ſerve God, <hi>Job</hi> 1. Theſe are ſtrong tempeſtuous windes, able to tear up the root of the
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:30767:370"/>
ſtrongeſt oak; but yet he ſtands like an immoveable root; and all becauſe of that integrity and ſincerity which he knew to be in himſelf; he knew his aims and ends to be pure, he knew he ſerved God for Gods ſake. As this is of great conſequence to defend againſt the devils accuſations, ſo alſo againſt the calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and falſe clamours of the devils inſtruments. As the devil is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>The accuſér,</hi> ſo all wicked men do diabolize; they charge the generation of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for hypocrites, for diſſemblers, for painted ſepulchres; but the knowledge of their own uprightneſſe, and the graces of God in their ſoul, do abundantly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie them; whereas this is terrible to have other men condemning us, and God alſo, and our own conſciences condemning us.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>This certainty is a ſpeciall means to breed contentation of minde, and a</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                     <hi>thankfull, chearfull heart in every condition.</hi> As we told you, <hi>David</hi> in that great exigency of his, <hi>incouraged himſelf in his God:</hi> and in his Pſalms, that the Lord was his portion, and his inheritance: Now this could not be known, unleſſe he alſo were certain of his godlineſſe; for God is not the portion or inheritance of wicked men. And upon this it is, that he ſaith, <hi>God had put more joy into his heart, then they have, when wine and oil increaſeth,</hi> Pſal. 4. If therefore thou wouldſt have that happineſſe on earth, true contentation of ſpirit, it muſt be from the knowledge of thy grace, and ſenſe of Gods love in Chriſt, when thou canſt ſay, Soul, take thy ſpiritual eaſe and heavenly quiet, for here are many good things ſtored up for thee: This is to be a godly <hi>Dives</hi> indeed, a <hi>Dives</hi> in ſoul, and to fare deliciouſly, in a ſpiritual ſenſe, every day.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <hi>This certainty of grace is a ſure and speciall antidote againſt death in all</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">6.</note> 
                     <hi>the fears of it.</hi> This makes the King of terrors, a King of all conſolations: For ſeeing that by grace we are the members of Chriſt, death hath no more ſting on us, then on Chriſt our head. And therefore the godly may in Chriſt triumph, <hi>O death where is thy ſting, O grave where is thy victory! 1 Cor.</hi> 15. 55. Theſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents may be handled, becauſe their ſtings are out. Let them howl and roar out at the approach of death, who know not whether God be their friend, or enemy, or rather may know he is their enemy; who have juſt cauſe to doubt, whether they are going to hell or heaven: Oh to ſuch, the very name and thought of death and judgement, muſt be full of amazement and terror: But to thoſe who are in a holy manner perſwaded of their intereſt in Chriſt, that perceive the ſure evidences of Gods grace in them; they may lift up their heads for their redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption draweth nigh: And indeed this ſhould much incite you, to ſeek after ſuch a ſupport at death. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> upon the ſentence of death paſſed on him, ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himſelf with this, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 20. 3. And what wilt thou do, when the hour of death approaches: here is no longer the comfort of thy riches, wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to be injoyed; here is no longer the company of thy friends and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to be retained. Oh then! when thou art to be ſure no longer of any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comfort, would it not be better then a world to thee to be ſure of heavenly comforts? Oh that you would be wiſe for your latter end. Do ſomething that may ſtand you in ſtead, when you are dying men, gaſping at the laſt. Drowning men uſe to catch hold on any thing. Oh dying and drowning men ſhould be ſure of a faſt hold to lean upon; Theſe are the advantages. <note place="margin">How to know true certainty which is wrought by the Spirit, from the falſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of a mans own heart. 1.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the godly heart may inquire, <hi>How ſhall I know this holy certainty and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion by Gods Spirit, from my own perſwaſion, from the ſelf-flattery that is in me?</hi> Are there not thouſands of people that call darkneſs light, and bitter ſweet? that conclude the truth and goodneſſe of their heart in all reſpects towards God. It's true it cannot be denied but that there are ſuch fooliſh dreamers, who dream of their fulneſſe when they are indeed empty; yet to a ſearching eye they may be quickly diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, <hi>Holy certainty is kept up in all exerciſes of grace, and conſtant tender avoiding of all known ſin:</hi> but preſumption will agree with the practice of all theſe. He is confident of Gods love, of his own good heart; yet a notorious
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:30767:371"/>
beaſt, a conſtant ſwearer, a conſtant liar, unjuſt in his dealing, luſtfull and volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous in his life. Oh theſe muſt needs be horſe-beetles that can live in ſuch dung; not Chriſts doves who delight in neat and ſweet places. What? thou hope in God? thou truſt thou haſt a good heart and a good conſcience when ſo much wickedneſſe is in thy life! This is impudent preſumption, and Gods eies are purer then to accept or love ſuch. Doth a man then think he hath grace in his heart, how carefull is he to practiſe all good known duties, and to avoid all known ſin.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Preſumption is unwilling to be ſearched and tried.</hi> It flieth from the light, it cannot abide the touchſtone; but this holy certainty loveth a deep ſearch. <note place="margin">2.</note> It is here as between the Heretique and the Orthodox man; Heretiques they are <hi>lucifugae Scripturarum,</hi> as <hi>Tertull,</hi> ſaid, The bats and owls that fly from the light. The thief hates the light, ſaith our Saviour, <hi>John.</hi> 2. 20. But the true doctrine, that deſireth to be tried and dived into. Then thus, where a true knowledge of grace is, that man crieth with <hi>David, Prove me, Lord, examine and try if there be any falſe way,</hi> Pſal. 26. 2. But where preſumption is, that would not have a cracked title, or a forged evidence brought before the Judge.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Preſumption beareth up a mans heart, till a man come to ſome great and extraordinary calamities, and then this bubble vaniſheth away.</hi> Its not truly root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <note place="margin">3.</note> and ſo will not abide a violent ſtorm. They fall from preſumption into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair. But ſee how <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>David</hi> can go through the hardeſt brunts; though they be under many briars, yet theſe innocent ſheep loſe not their wooll. Droſs will melt in the fire, but gold will be the more refined. The winde makes chaff fly away, but leaveth the corn more purified. <hi>The righteous hath hope in his death, Prov.</hi> 14. 32. then when the preſumptuous mans hope doth moſt wither many times.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Preſumption is not oppoſed nor aſſaulted by the devil.</hi> Satan doth not tempt and labour to drive people out of it, but nouriſheth them in it. But out of <note place="margin">4.</note> this holy certainty, the devils main ſcope is to drive them. You ſee he was not afraid to ſhoot out his fiery dart even at Chriſt himſelf, upon this, Whether he was the Son of God. And his ſtratagem was to make <hi>Job</hi> think, and condemn himſelf for an hypocrite. So that godly aſſurance is much oppoſed, both by the devil and the unbelieving heart of man; its hardly obtained, and hardly retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But of preſumption we may ſay, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> did of his ſons counterfeit veniſon, how comeſt thou by it ſo quickly my ſon? How come you to be confident thus quickly, thus eaſily? This man-childe is born, and your ſoul hath not been in tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell and pangs: this is not Gods way.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>It is the ſure character of preſumption, that it divideth the means and the end.</hi> It hopes for ſuch priviledges, though it never do the duties: Now this is <note place="margin">5.</note> not aſſurance, but a preſumptuous deluſion, whereas you ſee this text is, <hi>To give all diligence to make your calling ſure.</hi> Preſumption is like that charity <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of, that giveth good words, bids the party go home and be warmed and cloathed, but doth not give any thing; and in this preſumption moſt men live: They hope for that end, the means whereof they are never converſant in. Should they tempt God about their naturall life (they will not eat and drink and think to live) all men would ſay it were horrible preſumption: but though they do it pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pably about ſupernaturall life (they will neither repent or forsake ſin, or live ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily) and yet hope Chriſt will be their Saviour. Though they do thus, yet men ſee not their own folly and madneſſe therein.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, <hi>Preſumption is but a ſelf-deceiving, falſe logick that a man deceiveth himſelf with.</hi> Whereas you heard this certainty is a knowledge wrought by Gods <note place="margin">6.</note> Spirit in us. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any man ſeem to be religious and bridle not his tongue,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, he makes a falſe ſyllogiſme, <hi>James</hi> 1. 26. He takes <hi>non cauſa, procauſa;</hi> and indeed all preſumption is nothing but a falſe ſyllogiſme; a man takes that for a cauſe which is not a cauſe: or elſe it is an ignoration of the proper ſtate of the queſtion, that it is to be indeed godly, how much goeth to the nature of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="685" facs="tcp:30767:371"/>
Seventhly, <hi>The preſumptuous man is full of haughty arrogance and proud preferring</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">7.</note> 
                     <hi>of himſelf, contemning and undervaluing others.</hi> Thus that Phariſee, <hi>Lord I thank thee that I am not as other men,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas true aſſurance is accompanied with deep humility, and a pitifull reſpect to others, praying and mourning for others; Oh that their eies were opened; Oh that they were inriched with the grace of God, as they are. Humility and ſelf-emptineſſe is an inſeparable effect of godly aſſurance, and of precious eſteem with God. <hi>Minimum de ſe ſenſiſſe, tam mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num eſt quam maximas res feciſſe,</hi> The loweſt love, and the leaſt thoughts of our ſelves, is as great, as to have done the greateſt and moſt excellent things.</p>
                  <p>In the next place it may be queſtioned, What that godly perſon ſhould do, <note place="margin">What a godly perſon ſhould do that wants Aſſurance.</note> who hath not this aſſurance; though grace be in him, he knoweth it not, yea he thinketh the clean contrary. Even as <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 16. When Jeſus after his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection appeared to the diſciples, though he drew nigh to them, and talked to them, yet ſaith the text, <hi>Their eies were holden, that they did not know him.</hi> So it is with many a gracious heart, Chriſt is ſpiritually in the ſoul, grace is preſent, yet he cannot feel this. Though the ſun of righteouſneſſe be in his heart, yet he walketh in darkneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſuch an one we ſay, <hi>Let him walk in a faith of adherence and dependance when he hath none of theſe evidences.</hi> This the Scripture cals truſting, relling, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſtaying of the ſoul upon God. <hi>David</hi> in many Pſalms hath only this plank to ſtand upon in the great Ocean: For this you muſt know, though aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance be a duty, and to be preſſed after, yet it is not the faith that juſtifieth. Thou maieſt belong to God, and have an intereſt in the promiſe, though thou feel no evidences of it. <hi>Who is he that feareth God, walking in darkneſſe and hath no light, let him ſtay himſelf upon God?</hi> Iſa. 50. 10. So then, if thou findeſt thy ſoul like a parched heath; thou goeſt bowed down, thinking thy ſelf a withered branch, a dried tree; conſider what is thy duty, what doth God require of thee? even a depending and waiting on him. And this dependance of faith is far more noble then the aſſurance of faith.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, In aſſurance, there I go on in holy duties, and love of God, becauſe <note place="margin">The depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of faith more noble then Aſſurance 1.</note> of the ſenſible ſweetneſſe and delight that I have; but in dependance there I truſt in God, when I have no ſenſe or feeling: So then, as it is a greater act of love to God, when I love him though he afflicts me, though he bleſſeth me with no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mercies; ſo it is a greater act of obedience to wait and depend on God, when I feel my own unworthineſſe and load of ſin, then when the goodneſſe of my heart is cleared up unto me.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, To depend and wait on God, though darkneſſe be in thy ſoul, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueth <note place="margin">2.</note> thy faith more firm and ſtrong. As when the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> would not give over, though Chriſt called her dog, yet this made her faith to appear great faith. It was an high expreſſion in <hi>Iob, Though he kill me I will truſt in him.</hi> Do not then give over thy conſtancy in holy duties, be not diſcouraged in wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on God for aſſurance, for he will at laſt cauſe the ſun to ariſe, and the dark night to fly away.</p>
                  <p>And thus I ſhall conclude this text, ſtill preſſing you to be upon more ſure and certain terms about your ſouls, then many are. God bid <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſet his houſe in order before he died: Oh do thou ſet thy ſoul in order, caſt up all thy ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all accounts. It is a wofull thing when thou art dying, then to cry out, Oh I know not what to do, live I muſt not, dy I dare not; every thing is in diſorder, there is nothing ſure about my ſoul. What do you think my beloved brethren? Are not theſe things the greateſt reaſon in the world we perſwade you to? How unexcuſable will ye be? when will ye go away and ſay, It is true indeed, we ſhould be upon ſure terms, It is an happy thing to be ſo, but the world, that hinders me, my luſts they hinder me. I tell you the conſideration of theſe things have ſo affected men heretofore, that they have gone and lived in cells, and holds of the earth; they have ſhut themſelves up in woods and wilderneſſes, that they

                  <p>THe later part of this Text will continue further new matter unto us, while we treat of this Divine Vocation: and to bring you to the coherence of it, You may take notice of two great and ſtrange wonders recorded in the Chapter: The firſt is, That admirable Apparition of the holy Ghoſt in fiery cloven Tongues upon the heads of the Apoſtles: Wherein take notice of the time when this was, <hi>In the day of Pentecoſt;</hi> on this time the Law was given on Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> by <hi>Moſes;</hi> and now the Goſpel is to be preached to the whole world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Conſider the Manner of this Apparition, it was with a <hi>ruſhing mighty winde;</hi> this did denote the great efficacy and mighty power of the Spirit in the Word preached.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond way was of Tongues, to ſhew the gifts that God would beſtow upon the Apoſtles, and fiery Tongues to ſignifie the light, and the heat, and the purifying vertue that would be in the Word preached, and cloven Tongues, becauſe they would divide the Word aright to every hearer. Thus as once di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of Tongues was a judgement, and by it <hi>Babel</hi> was built; ſo here, divers Tongues are a mercy, and by it the ſpiritual <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is built.</p>
                  <p>In the next place you have the Efficacy of this Apparition demonſtrated in the Apoſtle <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon. And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, He confirmeth this wonderful work of God by a Prophecie out of <hi>Joel,</hi> wherein God promiſed <hi>To pour out his Spirit</hi> (that denoteth abundance) <hi>on their ſons and daughters, their men-ſervants and maid-ſervants,</hi> the meaneſt and moſt contemptible, contrary to that wicked ſaying of the <hi>Rabbins, Spiritus Sanctus non cadit ſuper animum pauperis;</hi> And after the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> had doctrinally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed them about Chriſt, and practically convinced them of their particular ſinne in crucifying of him (for <hi>Singularia ſunt quae pungunt)</hi> you have the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and ſavoury effect upon the hearers, deſcribed in two things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Their remorſe and trouble of conſcience for ſinne, <hi>They were pricked in heart,</hi> as a man that is ſtabbed at the heart with a dagger: This ought to be the fruit of all our Sermons, to ſend you away grieved and troubled, wounded at the very
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:30767:373"/>
heart. The tears of the hearers are the praiſes of the Preacher.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Their deſire and enquiry, <hi>What ſhall we do that we may be ſaved,</hi> then is our Miniſtery bleſſed, when it puts you upon theſe ſerious Queſtions. When you go home, What ſhall I do to be ſaved? I am out of the way, my ſinne is diſcovered, this Sermon hath told me of all the evil that ever I did: Oh what ſhall I do to be ſaved! Now that which is the ſecond wonder in this Chapter is, The Number of thoſe Perſons that were converted at this time: its ſaid, <hi>ver. 41. That they were about three thouſand.</hi> Here is one to be admired more then the Heathen <hi>Orpheus,</hi> that could make beaſts follow him, and tame their natures; for ignorant and prophane enemies, even a great multitude imbrace Chriſt. Here is <hi>Peter</hi> catching of men, as once he did fiſh, and the net is ſo full, that it is ready to break.</p>
                  <p>In the next place, You have <hi>Peters</hi> Advice and Councel, directing them into the way of Salvation; wherein conſider a two-fold duty; 1. <hi>Repent. 2. Be baptized,</hi> with the Object, <hi>Into the name of Chriſt;</hi> This doth not exclude the other perſons.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You have a two-fold encouragement; 1. From the benefit ſealed in Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm, <hi>Remiſſion of ſins.</hi> 2. A gracious Effect God would vouchſife to them, <hi>Ye ſhall receive the holy Ghoſt.</hi> And my Text is brought in as a reaſon, why they ſhould repent and be baptized, and hope for remiſſion of ſins, <hi>For the Promiſe is to you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Which words are diligently to be opened, becauſe of ſome late Queſtions ariſing about Infant-Baptiſm, that are ſtarted hence. In them you may obſerve, The mercy ſpoken of or publiſhed, <hi>The Promiſe.</hi> 2. The Subject, and that is in a three-fold enumeration, <hi>To you,</hi> viz. the Jews to whom then he preached. 2. <hi>Their Children. 3. To thoſe that are afar off,</hi>

                     </gap>, To the generations that are to come. To be ſure its meant of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> who in other places are ſaid <hi>To be afar off.</hi> And therefore you have this explained in the laſt expreſſion, <hi>Even as many as God ſhall call.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now firſt let us conſider, What is meant by the Promiſe. Thoſe that would elude this place ſo pregnant for baptizing of Infants of believers, becauſe the promiſe is made to them, ſay, Its meant of extraordinary gifts, ſuch as thoſe mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous gifts ſpoken of. But this is very abſurd, becauſe 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. all that did believe had not thoſe extraordinary gifts, <hi>All did not ſpeak with tongues, all had not the gift of healings.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Its againſt experience, for if the promiſe of theſe extraordinary gifts be made to believers, then why have they not all extraordinary gifts that thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it? Why do they not ſpeak in the Hebrew and Greek tongues? And</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 16. The promiſe of theſe extraordinary gifts is ſaid to be <hi>fulfilled at that time,</hi> and therefore not to be expected at any other time. By the promiſe therefore which ſometimes is in the ſingular, and ſometimes in the plural num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, becauſe of the many good and ſpiritual things promiſed therein, we are to underſtand the Covenant of grace, wherein God promiſeth to be the God of believers, and their ſeed; for that which was made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſetting aſide ſome perſonal priviledges, is made to every believer. Now in this Covenant is contained Pardon of ſinne, and all other mercies, which Baptiſm ſealeth; and that this is the meaning, is plain, <hi>Chap. 3. 25. Ye are the children of the Prophets, and of the Covenant God made with our fathers;</hi> So the promiſe here, is that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Covenant of God, whereby he offers grace to thoſe that do accept it; now thoſe that accept it are ſuch as are inwardly ſanctified, and theſe have the inward Covenant as well as the outward adminiſtration of it. But ſecondly, Others do only outwardly accept of it, and profeſſe their obedience to it, are not inwardly regenerated, and theſe onely have the external Covenant, and a right to Church-priviledges, being deſtitute of the ſaving benefit by them: So that
<pb n="688" facs="tcp:30767:374"/>
this promiſe of grace in the outward offer of it, as alſo in the Church-priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, are diſpenſed to ſuch, who ſometimes have an external profeſſion onely, but are without the inward efficacy of it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond ſubject is <hi>Their Children:</hi> Here we ſee God taking parents into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, takes alſo the ſeed, and upon this one main ground Infant-Baptiſm is faſtned: So that though children be not expreſly named in the command to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptize, yet they are in the promiſe accompanying the precept, and that may put it out of all doubt.</p>
                  <p>I choſe this verſe for the later part, containing the Subjects enumerated, <hi>viz. Thoſe that are afarre off, even as many as God ſhall call.</hi> From whence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That all men till called by God, are afar off from him.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This expreſſion doth contain the dreadful and woful eſtate of all men by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, They are afar off from God. As <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid to <hi>Dives, There was a great gulf between them two;</hi> ſo there is a remote diſtance between God and all men till called, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 13. Ye who were ſometimes afar off,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and ſo <hi>verſ.</hi> 17. Thus the Prodigal that took his ſtock to ſpend it upon ſinne, and the luſts of the fleſh, he is ſaid <hi>To go into a far countrey.</hi> Now when we ſay, All men till God call are afar off, you will eaſily underſtand that we ſpeak not of Gods omnipreſence, for that is impoſſible, none can be far off God in that ſenſe. <hi>Whether can I go from thy preſence,</hi> ſaith <hi>David; If I would take the wings of the morning, or go into the depths, or dig into hell, I cannot go from thee,</hi> Pſal. 139. 7. Now in this ſenſe, God is near even every wicked man, but we ſpeak of Gods gracious preſence and demonſtration of his loving favour, in which ſenſe its ſaid, <hi>That Cain was caſt out of Gods preſence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to open this more particularly, let us ſhew in how many particulars they <note place="margin">In how many reſpects wicked men are afarre off from God. 1.</note> are thus elongated, or made afar off from God. And</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>In regard of the knowledge of God in a true and ſaving way.</hi> They are as little children, <hi>in utero ignorantiae,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> expreſſed it, no more apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in a right manner of God, then the children in the dark womb are perceiving of the things of reaſon. Therefore <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. part of this diſtance from God is in that they were <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>without God in the world. Athens</hi> that was the eye of <hi>Graecia,</hi> yet that could ſee no better, then to dedicate an Altar <hi>To the unknown god;</hi> Hence the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Heathens, ſaid, <hi>They did feel or grope in the dark after God,</hi> Acts 17. 27. Even as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> in their thick darkneſs, or the <hi>Sodomites</hi> ſtricken with blindeneſs did; and therefore Gods willing of men to be ſaved, is declared in this, <hi>That he would have all men come to the knowledge of the truth;</hi> and generally the Nations of the world are deſcribed by this, <hi>That they know not God.</hi> Its true, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, ſomething that by nature may be known of God, ſome ſparks, ſome embers, but this is ſo corrupted, ſo confuſe, ſo imperfect, that it groſly miſtakes like that blinde man recovering a little ſight, that ſaw men like trees: Oh then, if to be a corporally blinde man be ſo heavy a miſery, that ſuch cried to our Saviour, <hi>Lord that we might receive our ſight!</hi> How much rather may we cry out to have the eyes of our eyes opened, who are wandring far from God! For although theſe that are here ſaid to be farre off are Heathens and Gentiles, yet even Chriſtians by birth are alſo farre off from God, till they have this ſpiritual eye-ſalve; and therefore in two reſpects men may be ſaid to be far off from God: Firſt, both in reſpect of inward grace, and the outward means of ſalvation: and thus all the Heatheniſh part of the world is afar off God: Or ſecondly, in reſpect of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward grace only: When men do enjoy the outward means of ſalvation, and in this ſenſe by their duties are ſaid To draw nigh God, but in reſpect of any ſaving work of grace, are as farre off as Heathens and Pagans: and this is the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as is to be feared, of many thouſands, They are nigh God in reſpect of the Chriſtian faith they profeſs in reſpect of the Duties and Ordinances they exerciſe
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:30767:374"/>
themſelves in, but in reſpect of their affections and heart, ſo they are at as great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from God and his holy waies, as Heathen and Publicans. This diſtinction muſt be attended unto, that we do not vainly deceive our ſelves, as the Jews did, with <hi>The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>They are afar off in respect of Gods speciall and gracious love to juſtifie</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>their perſons, to pardon their ſins.</hi> This alſo is urged <hi>Epheſ. 2. He preached peace to them that were afar off;</hi> Peace, ſo then there was war and enmity before be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and them. And thus they may be ſaid to be without God, both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively and paſſively; actively as before, having no knowledge or love of God; and paſſively, God hath no approving knowledge or love of them. Thus are we till God cals us, in a ſtate of Gods diſpleaſure; as <hi>Abſalom</hi> caſt out from <hi>Davids</hi> preſence. His anger is towards us all the day long: And if the terrour of a King be like the roaring of a lion; what are the frowns and diſpleaſures of the King of Kings! Oh that people were wiſe to conſider, what they are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, under what heavy diſpleaſure they are! Doth the Scripture bid us agree with a man that is an adverſary quickly in the way, leſt he deliver us to the Judge; what reaſon then is it, to agree with God our adverſary ſpeedily, who hath ſuch ſpiritual and eternal torments to ſcourge us with, that no man can have? Do not thou pleaſe thy ſelf then with theſe thoughts, that thou haſt free acceſſe to the preſence and into the favour of great ones on earth; for if thou art farre off from God, if he regard thee not, if his diſpleaſure be towards thee, thou art in the ſtate of gall and wormwood.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>We are by nature afar off from Chriſt the Mediator between God and</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>man.</hi> And this indeed is the foundation of all calamity; for as in Chriſt we are bleſſed with all heavenly bleſſings, ſo without him we are curſed with all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and temporall curſes. You ſpeak the ſumme and abſtract of all miſery, when you ſay a people are without Chriſt. This alſo is mentioned <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. as part of that diſtance from God. For ſuch is the contrariety between God and man, God an holy and pure God, man a wretched and corrupt enemy to him, that here could never be any reconciliation but by Chriſt. We ſee how farre off the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate Angels are caſt from God, never to be reconciled, and all becauſe Chriſt took not their nature upon him: And thus men without Chriſt, for the preſent, have no way of acceſſe to God; for why? Should they come in their own names? alas! they are ſinners, they are adverſaries unto God, who then muſt ſpeak for them? who will plead for them? And conſider, that not only the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and Pagans in the remote places of the world may be without Chriſt; but even many of thoſe who have the title of Chriſtians, and profeſſe obedience to him, may yet be without him in a ſaving manner. Will not Chriſt ſay to many who did propheſie and caſt out devils in his name, <hi>I know you not?</hi> So then Chriſt may not know many within the Church, many that call on his name. Oh be afraid leſt this truth ſhould be verified of any of you; that though you be near Chriſt in words, in prayer, in profeſſion, yet wholly without Chriſt in reſpect of any gracious effects. Now what is it, to have riches and honours, and to be without Chriſt? To have the great things of the world, and to have no portion in him? When God promiſed great earthly mercies to <hi>Abraham,</hi> oh ſaith he, <hi>I go childleſſe;</hi> that troubled him; what was all that wealth, if he had no childe? And thus; although God give thee all externall happineſſe, and the deſires of thy heart; yet ſay, behold I am without Chriſt ſtill, and what will all theſe things avail me.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Such as are afar off, They have no hope.</hi> They are an hopeleſſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; <note place="margin">4.</note> which way ſoever they look, every thing curſeth and condemneth them; and no marvell, for, if without the promiſe, they have not the ground of hope, and if without Chriſt, the object of hope. And this alſo is added in the forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned place, <hi>Epheſ. 2. Without hope.</hi> Now you know the Heathens faigned, that when all things were gone, yet hope was in the bottom of <hi>Pandoraes</hi> box; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying,
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:30767:375"/>
though we be invironed with calamities, yet as long as there is hope, the heart will not break. When <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> thought there was no hope (though that was their ſin) then they began to feel an hell burning in their conſcience. And indeed what is that which makes the fire of hell burn ſeven times hotter then it would, but that there is no hope there? Hence hope is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to an Anchor, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 19. implying that a man without hope, is like a Ship without an Anchor in the midſt of the raging ſea, and tempeſtuous waves. Thus not only the Gentiles, but Chriſtians alſo are afar off from hope, till ſanctified. Now when we ſay, <hi>They are without hope,</hi> the meaning is not, as if God might not ſhew mercy to them, for how many times doth he call thoſe his people, that were not his people; but in reſpect of any viſible humane help, no created pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er can ſave them: They are like little <hi>Iſaac,</hi> bound to be ſacrificed, and the hand lifted up to give the mortall blow; and then God comes in wonderfully, and provideth a Ram in his room to be ſacrificed. Lay it then home to your hearts, you that are afar off in reſpect of ſaving grace, though not the outward means of it; you are a people of no hope, no true ſolid hope. Indeed you have a preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, you have an hope that is a dream, a falſe imagination, and that will periſh like the blaze of ſtraw; but it is not a lively hope, for that property the Scripture giveth the hope of a godly man, It is a lively hope, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 3. ſuch as is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by death. <hi>The righteous hath hope in his death.</hi> If therefore thou wouldſt deſcend into a ſerious examination of this matter, thou wilt ſee thy ſelf for the preſent an hopeleſs man. Thou haſt no ground to hope upon; there is no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to draw out thy hope; What ſhould be like a two edged ſword at thy heart, if this be not? This carnall hope of thine will not indure, will not laſt, ſeek out for a better hope.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>Such are afar off in reſpect of their love of God, and an univerſal conſtant obedience to his holy will.</hi> As God loveth not them, ſo neither do they love God. <note place="margin">5.</note> As God is not gracious in his promiſes to them, ſo neither are they obedient to his precepts. God is not only afar off from them, but they alſo are afar off from God; hating and hated of God. As <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 4. deſcribing all men by nature, ſaith, they are all turned out of the way, <hi>and the way of God they have not known.</hi> Neither is this alſo true only of the Heathens, who are in every ſenſe afar off, but alſo of all thoſe, who within the outward means of grace, yet have their hearts ſet contrary to God. Doth not God of old complain of ſuch, that did <hi>draw nigh him with their lips, but their hearts were far from him,</hi> Iſa. 29. 13? And doth not the ſame complaint ſtill hold, that men draw nigh him, when their affections and lives are wholly oppoſite to God? And thus we may ſay of all thoſe, who draw nigh to God in religious duties, but in their hearts and lives are wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to him; they are afar off; they are at a great diſtance from God and his grace. Chriſt ſaw a young man, and becauſe he anſwered ſome queſtions in a diſcreet manner, he told him he was not far from the Kingdom of heaven; oh but when we ſee the prophaneneſſe, the ungodlineſſe of moſt mens lives, we have cauſe to ſay, They are far from the Kingdom of God, or they are not farre from the Kingdom of darkneſſe. Oh then conſider, you who live diſſolutely, and in the accompliſhment of the luſts of your fleſh, you are wholly out of the way; and to the faſter you run, ſtill the further off you are from happineſſe. You may fancie impoſſibilities, and think of making heaven and earth meet together; for this you do, all the while you judge that this life and way of yours is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with true peace and felicity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe</hi> firſt, What cauſe of thankfulneſſe we have, who live under the means of grace; for God hath brought us many degrees nearer to him, then when once we <note place="margin">Uſe.</note> were the children of Heathens. The time hath been, when this very Iland was wholly without God and Chriſt; the Goſpel was not preached unto us, we lay like a barren heath, and a curſed wilderneſſe, forſaken, and no notice taken of us by God. But ſince the Goſpel hath been preached, God hath drawn near to us, and
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:30767:375"/>
we to him: Oh! but for all this, we may be as far off from ſaving Graces as Heathens, if our lives be no better, if our converſations be no more Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annized: Thoſe places to whom the Sun draweth nearer, are warmer then the remote, cold parts, where ice and cold is: Thus it ſhould be with us, where the Sun of Righteouſneſs hath appeared, there ſhould be heat and zeal for God, there ſhould be meltings and mournings for ſin, there ſhould be a ſeparating from all droſs, and every evil way: <hi>Coler ſeparat hetrogenea;</hi> whereas froſt and cold hath faſtened many heterogenous things together, heat that ſeparates them: And thus the heat of the Goſpel ſhould ſeparate us from our former luſts, and from our by-paſt iniquities: and know this, he that is far off from God, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be near to the Devil and Hell: Thus the <hi>Epheſians</hi> that were without God, they were under the power of Satan, and in the ſtate of darkneſs: why then doeſt thou not tremble and fear thy condition? the farther that thou art going from God every day, the nearer thou art to hell: Your life is a motion, you are always a going, every action is a ſtep; now if it be ſinful, it is from God, and towards hell: What though thou findeſt the way pleaſant? though there be many delights and temptations in the way: <hi>Per fallacia bona itur ad vera ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la, per fallacia mala itur ad vera bona,</hi> Through ſeeming good and pleaſant things, we come to real miſery.</p>

                     <hi>That not all of mankinde, but ſome onely doth God call, with a ſaving call.</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle plainly makes a difference of theſe that are thus afar off, and this onely to come from God; ſome are ſo afar off, that they never hear the voyce of God in the word calling them to repent, and believe in Chriſt: Others again have ſalvation brought unto their houſe; and if thou ask, why God calls ſuch, and not others? <hi>Noli Scrutari,</hi> do not curiouſly pry in this myſtery, Gods ways are juſt, even when they are hidden to us: Too much gazing on this Sun, may quickly blinde us.</p>
                  <p>To open and clear this point, conſider,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That there is a general and common invitation,</hi> even of all in the world by <note place="margin">I. Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons opening the point.</note> God; and there is <hi>Aſpecial gracious one:</hi> The former invitation is by the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by the works of God; and as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>There is nothing hid from the heat of the Sun,</hi> Pſal. 19. That doth penetrate one way or other to every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary thing: So its true of this invitation and call, none is denyed it, none are ſo afar off, but that God thus calls: Now indeed, this is not properly, and in the Scripture ſenſe a calling, I do not remember that the Scripture any where makes the works of Creation and Providence, as a calling of men, unleſs in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large ſenſe; as the heavens are ſaid, to declare the glory of God, And the rod of God, or his judgements (though that be ſpoken of his judgements on the Church) are ſaid to have a voice. Now that God by the works of his Creation and Providence in the world, doth teach and convince men, and ſo in that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way call men, is plain, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. where the creatures made by God, are ſaid to declare thoſe inviſible properties of Gods wiſdom, power and goodneſs. Thus Divines ſpeak of a twofold School God hath, the School of the Creatures, and the School of Grace by the Goſpel: And though the books in the firſt School, <hi>viz.</hi> Of the Creatures, be very dark, and in characters hardly legible, yet God did puniſh and chaſtiſe men with very ſore and heavy judgements, yea, ſpiritual judgements, the worſt of all, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. becauſe they did not learn this leſſon, and were not proficients in that School: So then, the whole world, in the excellent harmony of it, doth neceſſarily teach a God: Even <hi>Tully</hi> doth by an excellent ſimilitude demonſtrate this: If (ſaith he) you ſhould ſee a Book conſiſting of many letters, and all thoſe exactly ſet together and orderly, ſo as to make up a compleat ſenſe; no man will ſay, Thoſe letters and words put themſelves toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or that they came together by chance: So it is with the world, This great book, the excellent compoſition and harmony of all things, do fully declare that theſe things did not make themſelves, or that they came accidently together, but a great God diſpoſed them by his wiſdom and power. This invitation <hi>Paul</hi> conſiders of in his Sermon at <hi>Athens, Acts</hi> 17. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> is to affirm, that by the works of God, the Sun, Moon and Stare, &amp;c. Man may be effectually called. 1.</note> by the Sun and Stars we may come to be effectually called, as well as by the Apoſtles, and the preaching of the Goſpel: But how ſenſeleſſe and abſurd is this? For</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>This invitation and call by the creatures, doth not, nor cannot reveal any thing of Chriſt, the onely cauſe of ſalvation:</hi> Without Chriſt there is no Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Now how is it poſſible by the Creatures, in a natural way of diſcourſe, that ever we ſhould come to know or believe in a Chriſt? The Doctrine about him is ſtill called a myſtery, and the revelation of it hath been more or leſſe clear, as God hath pleaſed to diſpenſe it: The very Angels did not know it, till revealed to them. Indeed, by the Creatures we may prove a Godhead, but to prove a Chriſt God and man, cannot be known by any Natural way of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>The call by the creatures is not ſaving, becauſe it diſcovers not the way</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">2.</note> 
                     <hi>of Salvation, no more then the cauſe;</hi> viz. <hi>Faith:</hi> As Chriſt is wholly a Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural object, and by revelation, ſo is faith the way to come to him, the hand to lay hold on him, onely by revelation: And therefore the Heathens, they looked onely for reaſon; the Goſpel way was a fooliſhneſs to them, the Chriſtians were called <hi>Credentes,</hi> Believers, by way of ſcorn; yea, learned men obſerve the very phraſes, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> are ſuch phraſes that no humane Greek Authors ever uſed: So that not onely the thing it ſelf, but the very words to expreſs it, are altogether ſtrange; where then there is no Chriſt, nor no faith, there muſt neceſſarily be no call to ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>This call could not be ſaving, for the furtheſt and utmoſt effect it had</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">3.</note> 
                     <hi>upon men, was onely outwardly to reform their lives:</hi> It reſtrained many from groſs ſins, and kept them in the exerciſes of temperance and juſtice, and ſuch Moral vertues; which though named vertues by <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> yet the Fathers did upon Scripture-grounds call them vices and <hi>ſplendida peccata,</hi> gliſtring ſins; for ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all that Piety and Morality which is out of the Church of God, is a <hi>Sodom</hi> apple, fair to the eye, and inwardly nothing but aſhes; for there is no true Sanctification, no true and right principles of holineſs, but within the Church of God. As typically every veſſel was unclean, that was not in the Temple, and ſanctified thereby. The heathens much boaſt of one <hi>Palaemon,</hi> a prophane beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, that came to hear <hi>Socrates</hi> at his Lectures, with a purpoſe to ſcoff and deride him, but went away wholly changed in his minde, and made ſober; but what is this one external change, to thoſe many thouſands and thouſands of changes which have been made both internally and externally by the word preached? But you may ſay, To what purpoſe is this call of God by the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the work of his providence, if it be not to ſalvation? Yes, it is much every way:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Hereby even all men are made inexcuſable:</hi> As the Apoſtle urgeth, God <note place="margin">1. To what uſe and purpoſe is the call by Gods works and providence</note> had not left them without a witneſs or teſtimony, giving rain and plentiful ſeaſons: Thus becauſe men did not glorifie God according to what the creatures might have taught them, they are given up to vile affections: Men therefore are made inexcuſable by this way; they cannot ſay, God hath left them without any conviction or manifeſtation of himſelf: No, the creatures they call, all the works of Gods juſtice and Gods mercy, they call; and then conſcience, which is implanted in every man, the dictates and reaſonings thereof, they alſo call: Thus there will be enough to clear God, and to ſtop every mans mouth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Gods purpoſe in theſe calls, is to reſtrain ſin, and to draw men on <note place="margin">2.</note> further then they do: There is no man that hath no more then this remote and confuſe call, that doth what he may do, and can do; He doth not improve, no, not that natural ſtrength that is in him: (I do not ſay) to ſpiritual good
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:30767:377"/>
things; for ſo he hath no natural ſtrength: but to ſuch objects as by nature he might: He willfully runneth himſelf in the committing of ſins, againſt his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and knowledge; he doth with delight and joy, tumble himſelf in the mire and filth of ſin: Now God calleth by theſe natural ways, to curb and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain him, to put a bound to theſe waves: For if there were not theſe general convictions, no Societies, no Commonwealths could conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, <hi>take notice of a twofold ſaving calling;</hi> The one is onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, <note place="margin">4.</note> and ſaving in reſpect of the ability and ſufficiency; the other is ſaving ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually, and in reſpect of the event. Now when the Apoſtle ſaith in the Text, <hi>As many as God ſhall call,</hi> it comprehends both; thoſe that are called effectually, as well as outwardly: they have not onely the outward adminiſtration of the promiſe, and the priviledges thereof, but all the inward profit thereof; on the other ſide, thoſe that have onely the outward call, they have onely external priviledges: And as <hi>Iſmael</hi> had many gifts from <hi>Abraham,</hi> but not the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; ſo have theſe many favors and priviledges from God, both for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their poſterity, but none of the inheritance it ſelf. Now you may underſtand the Doctrine of both theſe calls, Not all of mankinde are called with ſo much as an outward call, and of thoſe that are called with an outward all, not many, but few are called with an inward call; according to that Text, <hi>Many are called, but few are choſen:</hi> So then, behold the wiſe and dreadful ways of God herein; not the greateſt, but the leaſt part of mankinde are called with this outward invitation; and of thoſe who enjoy this outward invitation, not the greateſt, but the leaſt part partake of the inward power and efficacy thereof.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That God doth not call all men with this ſaving gracious call, will <note place="margin">III. That God doth not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually call all men, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</note> evidently <hi>de facto</hi> appear, if you conſider the ways of God, even ſince there was a Church, till now. In the beginning Gods call was onely among ſome few, ſo in <hi>Noah,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and ſo to his poſterity; and although we read of ſome ſtrangers, and a few Proſelytes, yet they were but as glean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to thoſe thouſands and thouſands that never heard of God: And in the time of the Jewiſh Church, God there ſeemed to incloſe his vineyard; among them onely was he know, <hi>Salvation was of the Jews,</hi> they were the children to whom meat did belong: So that no man can ſay, God did then hold out the Scepter of his grace to other Nations. Well, if we deſcend to Chriſts time, we muſt confeſs the partition wall was broken down; all nations then might be made clean: <hi>Peters</hi> ſheet of beaſts, clean and unclean, taught him that; but yet even ſince the preaching of the Goſpel, there are many nations of the world where Chriſt and the Goſpel have never been preached; indeed their voice is ſaid to ſound over the whole world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. becauſe its not forbidden to be preached to all men, as heretofore; yet many remote corners of the world have not enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the beams of this Sun: That as they ſay, the vertue of the Sun doth ſcarce ever come to ſome parts, but it is always winter, and moſt part night; ſo it is with many nations in the world, and the Jews who once were the children, now ſeem to be the dogs: The Apoſtle doth at large conſider, Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Gentiles, and ſeverity to the Jews, the natural branches, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. Its here with them, as it was with <hi>Gideons</hi> fleece and the floor, one while the dew was on the fleece, and the floor was dry; then the dew was on the floor, and the fleece was dry: Thus it is here, One while the Jews was a pleaſant gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and the Gentiles a wilderneſs; now the Gentiles a garden, and the Jews a wilderneſs; and if you ask, why is it thus: Its not for reaſon to diſpute, but faite to adore: <hi>Iſta mulier taceat,</hi> Let this woman, this reaſon, hold her peace in Gods Church.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>Its no injuſtice in God, though he do not give this univerſal call of grace to all men:</hi> For this hath been the ſtumbling block at which many have <note place="margin">IV. God cleared from injuſtice.</note> fallen: How can God (ſay they) be proclaimed ſo merciful, an ocean of all honey, in whom is no gall? how can he be ſo compaſſionate, and full of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="695" facs="tcp:30767:377"/>
bowels, yet not give the greateſt part of mankinde ſo much as a ſaving call outwardly; eſpecially how are all thoſe Texts made true, <hi>God would have all men to be ſaved;</hi> and, <hi>I delight not in the death of a ſinner, but that rather he ſhould be converted and live;</hi> eſpecially this may ſerve to take off all fault and blame from man, and to lay it wholly upon God, as if they would have readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly come to God, but God would not invite them. To remove this ſtone:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Conſider, That if we could not ſatisfie the reaſon and diſputes of men <note place="margin">1.</note> in this divine diſpenſation, yet if the Scripture be clear and peremptory in this point, we muſt all ſtop our mouthes, and not gainſay: Doth not the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. expreſly bring theſe carnal reaſonings? <hi>Who hath reſiſted his will? and why then doth he finde fault?</hi> But ſee how he rebukes this unrulineſs in man; <hi>Who art thou, O man, that diſputeſt against God?</hi> If then Scripture and expori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſaith thus much, we muſt conclude, Gods ways are juſt, though hidden to us: <hi>Even ſo Father, for ſo it pleaſed then,</hi> ſaid Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. upon the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Gods revealing things to babes and children, but hiding of them the wiſe men of the world: The Doctrine of the Trinity, of Chriſts Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are they not tranſcendently above our reaſon, though not contrary to it? <hi>Prorſus credibile quia impoſſibile,</hi> ſaid <hi>Tertullian:</hi> And thus all the great things of God, cannot be perceived by us: <hi>Quicquid de Deo dici poteſt eo ipſo indignum eſt, quic dici poteſt, &amp; periculoſum eſt de Deo, etiam vera dicere,</hi> ſaid the Ancients.</p>
                  <p>But Secondly, Even reaſon inforced out of Scripture, may ſatisfie us in many <note place="margin">2.</note> things; for its no injuſtice in God, if he had not called any men in the world with a gracious call; for ſeeing man by his fall had broken the Covenant with God, all things became forfeited into his hand; he was not bound to ſet up man with a new ſtock, after his firſt breaking; and this is evidently manifeſt, if you compare this with Gods dealing and diſpenſation to the Apoſtate An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; they fell from their habitation, and what became of them? they all are chained up in darkneſs, reſerved for eternal torments: Now this judgement is executed upon all, God did not ſpare one of them; to none of them was it ſaid, Believe and repent for the remiſſion of ſins: See here, it was no injuſtice in God to damn all the Apoſtate Angels, and then it could not be injuſtice to damn all Apoſtate men: This certainly may quiet thy heart.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, There can be no injuſtice, where all that is done, is done wholly <note place="margin">3.</note> out of grace, and meer favor. Injuſtice is, where a debt is denied, not where a favor is beſtowed; now the Scripture attributes this call of God, to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it is, wholly to the grace of God: Why then art thou murmuring if God call no more? rather admire the grace of God that he calls any; Is thy eye evil, becauſe God is good to ſave? The Devil he thinks God is gracious too much, and calls too many; he is tormented with malice, becauſe ſo many eſcape out of his Jaws.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Although God doth not call every man with this immediate call of grace, yet no man is damned meerly becauſe he wants this: The Apoſtle <note place="margin">4.</note> ſaith, <hi>That thoſe that are without the Law,</hi> viz. <hi>Written and revealed to them, ſhall be judged without the Law:</hi> And thus thoſe that are without the Goſpel, that have not the means of grace, they ſhall not be judged becauſe they did not believe in Chriſt, becauſe they did not ſubmit to him, but becauſe they did not walk in the practice of thoſe things they did know: Thus becauſe the Heathens did not glorifie God, according to the knowledge they had of him, therefore they are condemned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. Infidelity, meerly negative, doth not damn: He that believeth not, the anger of God abideth on him; <hi>viz.</hi> Where the word is preached and rejected, ſo that God doth not reap where he ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, God is not unjuſt, no not to thoſe that are afar off, becauſe none <note place="margin">5.</note> among them have done what they might do, in a natural and moral way: for although no man hath power in a gracious manner, to any ſpiritual good thing,
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:30767:378"/>
yet they may reſtrain from the outward actings of many groſs ſins: The very light of nature would teach a man to abhor many things, which yet the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens committed; ſo that God hath a juſt controverſie with them, and will be cleared when he judgeth the world.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Though God do not call all men, and thereby they are wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent, <note place="margin">6.</note> and unable to any good; yet they do not ſin ſo much, becauſe they want power, as becauſe they have a willing delight in it; and this indeed doth mainly remove all objections; for its not a mans impotency, ſo much as his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſent to ſin, that damneth him: his <hi>non poſſe,</hi> is in ſome ſenſe, his <hi>non velle. Bernard</hi> ſaith well of mans neceſſity that is now brought upon him to ſin; the neceſſity doth not take away the voluntarineſs of it, nor the voluntarineſs the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity: There is no man can ſay, O Lord, I had a will, I was very ready to come to thee, but thou didſt not give me power: No, the will in every man is the grand enemy and adverſary unto Chriſt in all his ways: Damnation is to man, becauſe unwilling, not becauſe unable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Uſe of Exhortation,</hi> Come and behold the ſeverity and goodneſs of God, as <hi>Paul</hi> in the like caſe; the ſeverity of God, in that he paſſeth over ſo many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and nations in the world; and his goodneſs, in that he draweth nigh to you; you are in the Land of <hi>Goſhen,</hi> when others are in <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkneſs: This hath amazed and aſtoniſhed all the wiſeſt men in the world, they have not been able to know what to ſay at this difference God makes; yea, many times God doth not vouchſafe the offer of grace to ſuch a people, who in all probability would be more affected with it, and giveth it to ſuch who refuſe and reject it: <hi>How unſearchable is his wiſdom, and his ways paſt finding out!</hi> Doth not our Saviour tell the men of <hi>Capernaum,</hi> that had the wonderful means of grace, <hi>Mat. 11. 31. If thoſe things had been done in Tyre and Sidon</hi> (two Heatheniſh places) <hi>they would have repented in duſt, in aſhes?</hi> Its thought, true repentance and converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is not here meant; but palpable and ſenſible demonſtrations they would have made of ſome ſorrow and humiliation; and therefore Chriſt threatens to take away the Kingdom of heaven from the Jews; <hi>viz.</hi> The Goſpel, and give it to a nation bringing forth fruit better then they: Oh conſider then, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the very Heathens and Pagans would not give more reſpect, and ſhew more joy at the word preached then thou doeſt: Take heed, for there are none further off grace, then thoſe that have been called, and yet reject it: There is more hopes of thoſe to whom the Goſpel was never rendered; for thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy judgements of an eye blinded, an heart hardened, do onely belong to thoſe that have refuſed this word of life: Then ſuch are onely fatted to deſtruction, who have been fed in theſe pleaſant paſtures of the Ordinances.</p>
