            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Letter ſent by General MONCK
To Vice Admiral GOODSON to be communicated
to the reſt of the Officers of the Fleet, in Anſwer to a Letter with ſome Propoſals
lately ſent to Him from Them.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Countrey-men and Comrades,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am glad that you have not forgotten your old friend, and that by this occaſion, I have ſuch advantage to hear of
your hearty affections to me, and kind remembrance of me, and that you have ſuch a deep ſenſe of the diviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us, and the miſerable conſequence thereof; but I am very much ſaded that you have entertained ſuch miſtakes
and miſapprehenſions of of our proceedings. Theſe encloſed Papers will fully certefie you, that we have juſt grounds
of disſatisfaction, and that we cannot comply with ſuch violent and unwarrantable undertakings, both againſt our reaſon
as men, and againſt our Conſciences as Chriſtians, that you and we ſhould take our Commiſſions and pay from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and yet to violate their Authority, after ſuch ſolemn aſſurances of obedience and faithfulneſs, contrary to the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
word of God, and our own late Addreſſes, I hope I am ſo well known to ſome of you, that I am none of thoſe that ſeek
great things to my ſelf, or delight in the ſheding the bloud of <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, much leſſe of Chriſtian Brethren, but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the name of God from blaſphemy and reproach, which our actings (I wiſh I could not call them) treacherouſneſs and
perfidiouſneſs have occaſioned; whereby Jeſus Chriſt and his truth have been evil ſpoken of, which makes our very lives
bitter to us, and to aſſert the integrity and honour of this Army, which is very dear to me, I have been forced with the
Parliaments Army under my command, (though with much grief of heart) to bear our Teſtimony againſt the late violence
of the Army; and the reaſons thereof you will find in our printed papers, &amp; our endeavours to perſwade them in <hi>England</hi>
to remove that force which they have put upon the Parliament. As to your Propoſals, I beſeech you ſeriouſly to conſider
and lay to heart theſe following Anſwers.</p>
            <p>1. To the firſt, you are pleaſed to intimate the joy of the Cavaliers that they ſee us ſtand to our Declaration, but I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that this violent interruption of the Parliament was the greateſt courteſie to gratifie that Family and Intereſt that
could be imagined in the World, (and I could wiſh it were not deſigned). I ſhould be very ſad to ſtrengthen and hands of
of the wicked, but let me aſſure you, this ariſeth from the ſlanders and calumnies which men caſt upon us in <hi>England,</hi> as if
we that aſſert the Authority of thoſe that brought the late King to the Block, are for introducing that Family, which I take
God to witneſſe, we in our very thoughts abhorr, and ſhall ſpend our blood in oppoſition to any Single perſon whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
            <p>2. You are pleaſed to compaire our preſent differences to that of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> with the two Tribes of <hi>Reuben, Gad,</hi>
and half the Tribe of <hi>Manaſſes</hi>) and I earneſtly pray that there may be the ſame iſſue, for if they will reſtore theſe perſons
to their lawfull Authority which have been eſtabliſhed by many ſucceſſes, and for the difference of which they ſo lately ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarded
to blood, we ſhall quietly ſit down and waite upon the providences of God in our places and Stations, and to this
end we have ſent Commiſſioners into <hi>England,</hi> men faithfull and approved, what you are pleaſed to inſtance concerning my
ſatisfaction in the year 1653. When this Parliament was interrupted formerly, I ſhall anſwer you to that, it was never in
my Conſcience to go out of Gods way under the pretence of doing Gods work, and you know the variety of times doth
much vary the nature of affaires, and what might then patiently be ſubmitted unto, we being engaged with a forraine Enemy
in a bloody Warre cannot be drawn into a preſident at this time; after our Repentance and aſſurance of Loyalty and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy;
you may be pleaſed to remember that the conſequence of the former Interruptions was the Introduction of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
perſon, and a manifeſt breach of all our promiſes and engagements, ſo that if God bleſſed me with ſucceſs, then I do
much more through mercy expect it now, when I put all to hazard for the Glory of God and the good of his people.</p>
            <p>3. I do acknowledge that the Army hath been in the hand of God and inſtruments of good to theſe Nations, yet if they
ſhall apoſtate from the Cauſe of God and his people in expoſing them to Arbitrary Power, and the wills of men, in taking
upon them to Abolliſh Lawes, raiſe money without conſent of the people, deſtroy Miniſtery and property, and force Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aments,
I cannot but witneſs againſt ſuch proceedings as unwarrantable not ſuted to any rule either from God or man.</p>
            <p>4. I have taken care by Garriſons in this Country, and aſſurance from the whole body of the Nation, that they will not
own the intereſt of <hi>Charls Stewart,</hi> and that they will preſerve the peace of the Commonwealth in obedience to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament;
So that if that part of the Army in <hi>England</hi> will ſet up a diſtinct Intereſt in the Nation, in deſerting that Cauſe
that hath been ſo precious to us, and coſt ſo much blood and treaſure for to eſtabliſh their own intereſt and greatneſs. I
do declare in the preſence of the Great God I cannot own you, nor joyne with them; Now having opened my heart to
you, and as you know my plainneſs and ſincerety, that I am none of thoſe that dare aſſert any thing againſt my Conſcience,
from that experience ye have had of me, I heartily begg your belief and credit, that I ſhall keep in the way of duty and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to do the Lords work in my Generation, and ſhall not own any corrupt intereſt whatſoever, and do deſire of God
his bleſſing according to my Integrity in this undertaking, having this good Teſtimony in my own Spirit, that I have nothing
but publick and Righteous ends upon my heart, and by all theſe reſpects and kindneſſes that I have received from you, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
you will joyne with us in your deſires that this Parliament may be reſtored to the execution of their duties and truſt,
with freedome and honour; I have no more but my hearty Love and ſervice to you all, deſiring God to bleſs you all, and
make you happy inſtruments for the good of theſe Nations in your ſeverall places which ſhall be alwayes the Prayer of dear
Friends.</p>
