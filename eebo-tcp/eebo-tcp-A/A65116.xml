            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT was not, <hi>Reader,</hi> the ultimate end of our <hi>Poet,</hi> in this precedent <hi>Poem,</hi> barely to deliver the story of <hi>AEneas</hi> his <hi>Errours,</hi> or <hi>Perigrination</hi> from <hi>Troy</hi> into <hi>Italy,</hi> with those <hi>Accidents</hi> which befell him therein; which, (although there were in it, no further <hi>scope</hi> then that) yet is so trim and well contriv'd a <hi>Narrative,</hi> that it is of it self sufficient to entitle this a most excellent piece: No: our wise <hi>Authour</hi> had a more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert and mysterious design; and, in this wel-built fabrick of his gives us the full prospect of a well-order'd <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> with all the <hi>integral</hi> parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; which whilest we endeavour to

            </p>
            <p>Wherefore,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Com-wealth.</hi>
               </note> behold first in the grosse or general, our supposed Common-wealth, to wit, a ship, or Fleet at Sea, between both which the <hi>Allegory</hi> or Comparison is as natural, as it is fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, and therefore needs no further <hi>illustration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next we come to the parts <hi>integral,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>The foure parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of</hi>

            <p>First,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>The Prince.</hi>
               </note> Behold in the accomplish'd <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,</hi> the <hi>Prince</hi> or supream Magistrate, as the principal member, or rather head of our <hi>Common-wealth</hi>: and him we will consider in these three Princely Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43250:32"/>
or qualifications, which are here given him: First, in his <hi>Piety</hi>: secondly, in his <hi>Wisdome</hi>; &amp; thirdly, in his <hi>Valour</hi>:</p>
            <p>
               <note n="1" place="margin">
                  <hi>His Piety.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Piety,</hi> with the <hi>Latines</hi> is first ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for that due observance, respect and devotion, which we pay to God; and secondly for that duty and reverence we give to our parents; so that <hi>pius</hi> signifies as well <hi>dutifull,</hi> as <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi>; and he that is truly <hi>pious</hi> in the one sense, will be so in the other: None was therefore either more <hi>Religious,</hi> or <hi>Dutifull</hi> then <hi>Virgils AEneas,</hi> our imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Prince. As a pregnant proof of both which take this story, which I ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually light upon the other day in <hi>AEli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>: Var. Hist. l. 3. c. 22. <hi>When</hi> Troy <hi>was taken, and sack'd, (sayes he) the</hi> Greeks <hi>pitying the miserable condition of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued</hi> Trojans, <hi>proclaimed, by sound of trumpet, that it should be lawfull for them, to make choise of any one thing they pleased, and to carry it away with them</hi>: AEneas <hi>therefore, neglecting all things else, chose his</hi> House-hold Gods: <hi>The</hi> Greeks <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring the</hi> Piety <hi>of the Man, gave him leave to take any one thing of his</hi> Moveables; <hi>who slghting the most pretious of his Iewels,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:43250:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and other goods, took his old decrepit Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon his shoulders. The Enemy admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring at this second demonstration of</hi> Piety, <hi>gave him his whole Estate free, with liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to go whether he pleased: adding, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. that the most implacable enemies ought to shew mercy to those, who were religious to the Gods, and dutifull to their Parents.</hi> Hence <hi>Virgil</hi> introduceth him here fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his Gods, often praying and Sacrificing to the same; and, to say truth, <hi>Religion,</hi> (were there no other end in it, then <hi>a politick</hi>) ought to be the chief care and study of the Prince, as being the very <hi>Basis</hi> of all <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and the surest tye of <hi>Obedience</hi>: whence, it rightly hath its denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a <hi>religando,</hi> which signifies, <hi>to binde fast,</hi> or <hi>to tye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for his <hi>Wisdome</hi>;<note n="2" place="margin">
                  <hi>His Wisdome</hi>
               </note> that appears, as well in his readinesse to ask and follow good Counsel, as in his abilities in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the same: Hence <hi>Virgil</hi> makes him frequently consulting with the Gods; <hi>and good Counsellours are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:43250:33"/>
as Gods to Princes</hi>: often with <hi>Prophets,</hi> and <hi>Interpreters</hi> of <hi>Oracles</hi>: par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, with his Father <hi>Anchises,</hi> an experienc'd, and sober old man; with <hi>Sibylla</hi> (a great prophetesse, inspired by <hi>Apollo</hi>) that is, a person endued with much wisdome, whereof he was the supposed Deity; and with <hi>Helenus,</hi> a knowing and a well-known friend: a person as <hi>honest,</hi> as he was <hi>intelligent</hi>: mark what <hi>qualifications</hi> ought to be in <hi>Counsellours</hi> of State, <hi>Age, Experience, Wisdome</hi> and <hi>Integrity</hi>: The <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> of <hi>Anchises</hi>; the wisdome of <hi>Sibylla</hi>; and the <hi>Integrity</hi> of <hi>Helenus</hi>: As for his abilities in giving good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, in directing, governing and ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>naging his Affaires, that appeares in the whole <hi>Series</hi> and course of his life: to enumerate particulars herein, would be infinite.</p>
            <p>Lastly, for the <hi>valour</hi> of our <hi>AEneas,</hi> or Prince,<note n="3" place="margin">
                  <hi>His valour.</hi>
               </note> that is also twofold: <hi>active</hi> or <hi>passive,</hi> of both which there are such clear and undeniable demonstrations, that we shall not insist long upon this head: the first appears in his several ranconters, often charges, victories,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:43250:33"/>
and triumphs: the latter in his suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, distresses and afflictions; in which no one ever shared more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, than himself: How was he tos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed up and down? how often in storms and tempests? how often driven from place to place? disappointed in his designes? Defeated in his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts? still persecuted by <hi>Iuno,</hi> his mortal or rather immortal enemy: yet, behold him ever unshaken, unmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, undaunted: still constant in the pursuit of his Counsels, till at last, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercoming the malice both of fortune and his enemies, he accomplish what he drives at, and what was by the fates laid out for him; and setting foot in <hi>Italy,</hi> there lay the foundation of a never-declining <hi>Monarchy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, now, <hi>most gracious Soveraign,</hi> it is not that I have wrested this Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, in delivering things otherwise, then they are represented by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour in the precedent Poem, that, I might direct this Application to your Royal Self: No, should I therefore compare your Majesty with our <hi>AEneas,</hi> in those three princely <hi>qualifications,</hi> above mentioned, none could truly

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> like reverence to your <hi>Royal</hi> Father both living and dead: which manifests it self in your Justice <hi>Distributive,</hi> which consists in <hi>Punishment</hi> and <hi>Reward,</hi> the two principal wheels, upon which that great engin of a <hi>Common-Wealth</hi> makes its <hi>rotation</hi>; the first in taking just revenge upon the horrid murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of your Royal Father, our Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soveraign; a <hi>parentation</hi> indeed, considering the unparallel'd hainous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and enormity of the fact, not in
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:43250:34"/>
the least severe: the second, in restor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and rewarding his old Servants, and such as have either acted or suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for him.</p>
            <p>As for our second <hi>qualification,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>AEn.</hi> 1</note> we require in our Prince, and finde it in our <hi>AEneas,</hi> a <hi>readiness</hi> in taking, and an <hi>ability</hi> in giving good Councel, the first your <hi>Majesty</hi> hath sufficiently demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated as well in the choise of your <hi>Councell,</hi> and Correspondence all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with your <hi>Parliament,</hi> as you have the latter in your prudent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of affairs, of which we all see the happy effects, and taste the blessed fruits.</p>
            <p>But, for your <hi>Valour,</hi> both <hi>Active</hi> and <hi>Passive</hi>; the footsteps and impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of them are so fresh and so many, that we should loose our selves in the enumeration of them, should we but once enter upon them: <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, France, Flanders,</hi> all the world rings of them: to be short;

and multiplied revolutions, we, to our <hi>ineffable</hi> joy, see your sacred Majesty, (like another <hi>AEneas</hi> in his promis'd <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talie</hi>) by the undeniable conduct of the divine providence seated &amp; firmly fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in your <hi>paternal</hi> Throne, never thence to be removed, till such time as you shall be translated from earth to heaven.

leasurably in affairs of moment, then to precipitate, and that a profest States-man, ought rather to chuse the safer then the nearer way: for herein our english proverb takes place, <hi>the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest way about, is the nearest way home:</hi> Secondly he recommends to him above all things, by prayers and sacrifice, to reconcile and conquer his implacable enemy <hi>Iuno</hi>: for; as <hi>Donatus</hi> upon this place: <hi>Ostendit</hi> Poeta <hi>majoris potentiae ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micos obsequendo potius, quam resistendo posse superari: 'tis wisdome rather to gain a potent enemy by obligeing him, then to run the risk of subduing him by force, the success where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is uncertain.</hi>

Now the <hi>Qualifications</hi> of such a <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> are chiefly two, <hi>Vigilance</hi> and <hi>Dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,</hi> or experience in matters of State: thus <hi>Palinurus,</hi> whilest others slept:
<q>
                  <l>Haud segnis strato surgit —</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>There's his <hi>Vigilance</hi>; Now for his <hi>Dexterity</hi> or <hi>Experience.</hi>
               <q>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But to be a little more particular in Charactizing our great <hi>Minister,</hi> we will adde a note or two; <hi>Virgil</hi> then speaks thus of <hi>Palinurus,</hi> as we have (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our manner, that is, imperfectly) rendred him.
<q>
                  <l>Night was not yet half spent, when from his bed</l>
                  <l>Awaken'd <hi>Palinurus</hi> nimbly fled:</l>
                  <l>The winds observ'd, to ev'ry blast gave ear,</l>
                  <l>Mark'd all stars gliding in the silent sphear</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Arcturus,</hi> and the dripping <hi>Hyadae</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>The two <hi>Bears,</hi> with golden <hi>Orion</hi> he Contemplats:</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>From hence we draw two wholsome precepts, and such, as above all others, must diligently be observ'd by our great <hi>Minister</hi>: First, he is to <hi>observe the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:43250:37"/>
wind, and listen to every blast</hi>; that is, to hold intelligence in all places; and to have an ear to all reports, that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly as the <hi>winde</hi> blows, he may <hi>trim</hi> the <hi>sailes</hi> of his own <hi>ship</hi>; and may not be surpriz'd by a sudden <hi>Gust</hi>; which may happily <hi>overset</hi> both him and it: Next, he is <hi>to mark the stars,</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly to <hi>steer</hi> his <hi>course</hi>; that is, to understand perfectly the <hi>Interests</hi> of all neighbouring Kingdomes and States, and to know what <hi>Influence</hi> or <hi>Aspect</hi> the affairs of other Princes have in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to those of his own master.</p>
            <p>And should I, Reader, say that our gracious Soveraign is blessed in such a <hi>Minister,</hi> in the <hi>Right Honourable,</hi> the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> the present <hi>Lord High Chancellour</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> I should say no more, then what is evident by those daily dispatches, which passe through his hands, and that weight of affairs which presse, but cannot oppresse him:
<q>
                  <l>— Sic <hi>Hercule</hi> quondam</l>
                  <l>Sustentante <hi>Polum,</hi> melius Librata pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendit.</l>

            <p>Which the excellent <hi>Claudian</hi> applies to <hi>Stilico,</hi> the great <hi>Minister</hi> of State to the Emperour <hi>Honorius,</hi> and which I hope without offence to his Lordships modesty, or violence to the <hi>Poets</hi> sense, we may thus render in English:
<q>
                  <l>Thus, when great <hi>Hercules</hi> his shoulders lent</l>
                  <l>To under-prop the Heav'ns, the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</l>
                  <l>Vnmoved hung: Nor did the <hi>Zodiac</hi> fear</l>

            <p>But for as much as <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>People, Governour</hi> and <hi>Governed</hi> are <hi>Relatives,</hi>

and therefore not <hi>Subsistent</hi> one without the other, behold our <hi>Poet</hi> gives his <hi>AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas</hi> a competent number of <hi>Subjects,</hi> which, he ever calls by the name of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cij</hi>: by which word the <hi>Latines</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand a <hi>Companion, Allie,</hi> or <hi>Confederate</hi>: in both which senses the people may most properly be called <hi>Socij,</hi> First: they are <hi>Companions,</hi> for they must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to accompany the <hi>Prince</hi> in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: if he be opprest, they must be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slav'd; if he be dethron'd, and murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, their <hi>lives, fortunes,</hi> and <hi>liberties</hi> are all at the mercy of the Usurping <hi>Tyrant</hi>: We need not go farr for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance to make good this: the late di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions out of which we are (by the blessing of God) now happily deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd are a sufficient proof of our assertion: Next they are <hi>Allies</hi> or <hi>Confederates</hi>; now such are bound to take up arm's for the mutuall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence one of the other, and that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce that offers an injury to the one, doth it to the other; thus the people are bound to expose their lives, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and all they call theirs in the defence of the Princes <hi>Crown, Dignity,</hi>

forecast imaginable, be avoided: to judge by successe is <hi>irrational</hi>; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times weak <hi>Councels</hi> take effect, when the best-digested <hi>designes</hi> are fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated, for as much as <hi>Chance</hi> and <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident</hi> have a share in both: I could be copious upon this subject, and plentiful in instances, but I designed onely a few hasty <hi>Reflexions,</hi> and a running dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
