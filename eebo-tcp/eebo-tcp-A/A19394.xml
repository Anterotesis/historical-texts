            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>But these succeeding not to their wish, nor sorting to that effect they purposed; sundry of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, &amp; pursued a more politike course. for by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:19125:4"/>
others (more simple) excited cunningly by them, they chalenge diuers receiued proceedings in Courts Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall, not to bee iustifiable by lawe: pretending now their especiall griefe to rest herein; for that they are delt with and oppressed contrary to law, euen as if they did carie a principall and zealous care to haue all her Maiesties lawes dulie obserued.</p>
                  <p>By whose frequent clamours, some very graue, wise and learned (no way affected to their other fansies) ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not being well informed of proceedings <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall,</hi> or not weying (for want of leisure) certain points seeming to bee doubtfully reported in the bookes of Common lawe, so throughly as their great learning therein doeth affoord: in a kind of commiseration (for so I interprete it) towards some of those who seeme di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed, and to be otherwise well meaning men; haue lately called into question diuers proceedings Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical, both for <hi>matter,</hi> and for circumstance or <hi>maner;</hi> that they are contrary to the lawes of this Realme.</p>
                  <p>Yet all of them doe not iumpe in the selfe same opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions hereafter touched. For they are seuerally hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by seuerall men; the most whereof, are stood in by men of meanest place and reckoning in that studie; and such as are knowen to bee ouermuch addicted to factious innouations. But all the chalenges whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer (for contrarietie vnto the lawes of the realme only, so farre foorth as they are hitherto commen to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge) may fitly be reduced into this order &amp; summe. They tende to the chalenging of proceedings Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall, done either by those who proceed by her Maiesties immediate Commission, who are either <hi>Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges delegates</hi> (dealing in matters onely betwixt partie and partie brought before them by appellation) or
<pb facs="tcp:19125:4"/>
Commissioners in causes Ecclesiasticall (seruing espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially for punishing of crimes &amp; offences) or els such as be executed by those, who deale in <hi>ordinary iurisdiction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The exceptions that touch the very matter and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect of Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, do in very deed by necessarie consequence tend, either to the whole ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of the Ordinarie iurisdiction (as where it is affirmed, that <hi>no Canon, constitution, nor ordinance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinciall whatsoeuer, may now be put in vre, without her Maiesties expresse assent first had to execute the same:)</hi> or els do reach to the taking of it away but in part.</p>
                  <p>Those opinions that tend to the abridging of it but in some part; doe goe about it partly by way of exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ecclesiasticall Iudges, from the handling of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine matters; (as by holding, that <hi>none Ordinarie may cite any whomesoeuer, but in causes Testamentarie and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniall:</hi> and that <hi>no Lay man ought to be cited or sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to appeare before any Iudge Ecclesiasticall, to take an oath in any other cause, then Testamentarie or Matrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all:)</hi> And partly by deriuing them from the conisance Ecclesiasticall vnto other Courts: (as that <hi>the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of heresie now lieth rather in the Common law, then in the law Ecclesiasticall:)</hi> and some other of them (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defended by the same men that holde the next precedent opinion) doe tend both to the excluding of Courts Ecclesiasticall, and to the diuerting of such causes another way, as that <hi>nothing now can be adiudged heresie, but according to the statute,</hi> 1. Eliz. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>As for the exceptions (pretended to be taken from the lawes of the Realme) against the circumstances, or <hi>maner</hi> of proceeding in courts Ecclesiasticall, they do either concerne such points as goe afore, and are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratories to the suite (&amp; such is this: that, <hi>the Queenes
<pb facs="tcp:19125:5"/>
Maiestie cannot giue, nor any man receiue authoritie, to vse any other processe in matters Ecclesiasticall, then by citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:)</hi> Or do touch the maner of entring into the suite, as that <hi>an Ecclesiasticall Court may not proceed without accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or presentment,</hi> and that <hi>Lay men may not be cited</hi> ex officio, <hi>in any cause but Testamentarie or Matrimoniall:</hi> Or they concerne the maner of handling, and procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in the suite, as that, <hi>If a matter be duely presented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a man, he may not be examined vpon his oath:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto some (belike meaning to qualifie and distinguish it) do adde this, <hi>viz. in a matter of incontinencie or such cause:</hi> and that, <hi>no man is bound to declare any matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another, except some be an accuser:</hi> Or do concerne the sentence or iudgement of the Court Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, as that <hi>by none Ecclesiasticall authoritie, a man may be depriued of his benefice being his freeholde, being not endi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and no suite of partie offered against him:</hi> Or els doe touch the execution of the iudgement: as that the <hi>Q. Maiestie cannot giue, nor any man may take authority of her, to vse any coërtion for any matter Ecclesiasticall, but exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications &amp; such like:</hi> and that therefore <hi>a man may not be punished by imprisonment or fine, for or in any matter Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall:</hi> and lastly, that <hi>a man that standeth aboue fortie dayes excommunicate, may no way be punished, but vpon the writ</hi> De excommunicato capiendo: <hi>and that the said writ may not be awarded, but vpon originall cause arising vpon some of the ten crimes touched in the stat.</hi> 5. El. c. 23.</p>
                  <p>But others that be indeed professed dealers for an innouation in the Church (when they are conuented before authority) not only do most greedily take hold of these exceptions pretended to be taken from the Common law against iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall; but do allege also sundry others, yet pretending to ground
<pb facs="tcp:19125:5"/>
themselues for both, not alonely vpon the lawes of the realme (as those do, of whom we hitherto haue spoken) but vpon Gods law also, the Ciuill, the Canon, or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall law, and vpon equitie and reason. Not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they were persuaded by the pregnancy of any of these so to thinke, but hauing embarked themselues in that common quarrell, <hi>viz.</hi> to impugne the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Ecclesiasticall of this Realme, in all things to their vtmost: haue first (as is probable) entred into the opinions; and after haue sought some colour to vernish them ouer with, wheresoeuer they could hit of it. Which their exceptions peculiarly framed by the professed <hi>Innouatours,</hi> and their owne proofs both for them, and for these also afore recited, (which were put into their heads by some Lawyers) shall (God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling) then be distributed &amp; layd forth, when we come to the handling of them, because other parts of this Treatise are more apt for that purpose, then this <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Preface.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>These opinions of late ringing sundry times in mine eares, and seeming to me to be diuersly mistaken; I called to memorie (so nere as I could) what, and where I had read any thing touching them. Whereupon tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning some books, and confusedly noting what I found, I was more and more confirmed in my former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, sufficient for mine owne persuasion.</p>
                  <p>Now because you pretend not to haue trauelled in these kinde of questions, &amp; haue so earnestly importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me to take some paines therein: I haue bin content for your owne onely priuate reading &amp; satisfaction, to plot my simple conceits into this order as you see. For owing very much vnto you, &amp; therefore not daring to deny you so small a matter, I haue (with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> litle leasure I
<pb facs="tcp:19125:6"/>
could get) hazarded rather to haue want of iudgement in me, then lacke of good will, by you to be censured. Meaning in the first part of this Treatise to pursue the particular order heere aboue comprised: sauing that those foure recited opinions which touch the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances <hi>of entring into a suite Ecclesiasticall,</hi> and <hi>the maner of proceeding in it,</hi> I shall be forced (contrarie to the naturall methode) to put after all the others, as requiring seuerall handling, and falling more fit in the second and third partes of this Treatise.</p>

Which Treatise (by him to whom it was addressed) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then imparted vnto certaine others of honour and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, it is saide, that they were also desirous to haue copies thereof, for some considerations to themselues best knowen.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The booke was somewhat long, and had many quotations, so that it coulde not conueniently in any short time be written out truely and faire, for so many as seemed earnestly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest it. Hereupon it was then (in priuate sort) committed to the presse, and fourtie copies, or there abouts were printed, without any purpose of further publishing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It appeareth nowe, that neere about the same time, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> Doctours <hi>of the</hi> Ciuill <hi>lawe (required thereunto by some in authoritie) did agree vpon a briefe schedule, contey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning some groundes of ministring an oath</hi> of office <hi>in crimes punishable by</hi> Ordinaries, <hi>and Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction: a matter referred but to priuate consideration, and desired for like satisfaction onely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This small schedule was after deliuered foorth (by some to
<pb facs="tcp:19125:7"/>
whose handes it came; as the report went) to be confuted by certaine</hi> Diuines <hi>and</hi> Ciuilians <hi>of either</hi> Vniuersitie, <hi>and by certaine professing the</hi> Common <hi>lawe.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Sure it is, that within foure moneths after, a</hi> Treatise <hi>(said to be penned against the purport and drift of that sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dule) by sundry (holden wise, &amp; not vnlearned, to whose sight the written copies thereof were credited) was most highly commended, and extolled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It seemed so precious, that copies thereof (though desired) were made very rare: and not vouchsafed to the vulgar and meaner sort, but kept</hi> tanquam Cereris mysteria. <hi>So that almost a yeere (after knowledge of it had,) did passe; ere it happened to come to my poore handes: and that was by the meanes of a right</hi> noble Counsellour, <hi>who had also much adoc, to procure a copie thereof for himselfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That which came to my handes doeth carry this title, viz.</hi> A briefe Treatise of Oathes, exacted by Ordinaries and Ecclesiasticall Iudges, to answere generally to all such Articles or interrogatories, as pleaseth them to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound: and of their forced and constreyned oathes <hi>ex officio:</hi> wherein is prooued, that the same are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I was glad of this opportunitie offered; for I hoped to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in some important point, that I had not afore consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of: and either to be aright perswaded (whereof I am most desirous) if I had mistaken; or else be confirmed in my former opinion. For there was reason I should so be, if in a booke drawne with so great aduise, by men of such rare skill and dexteritie, and so well digested, I should not finde</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratiue <hi>arguments, euen to presse mine assent against the course (as I tooke it) of the lawes both</hi> Ciuill <hi>and</hi> Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall; <hi>against the practice of all the other states of</hi> Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome; <hi>and against apparent approbation thereof by</hi>

Gods <hi>booke it selfe.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>But when I had first cursorily runne that</hi> Treatise <hi>ouer; I must confesse, I was partly drawne into cogitation, that I had not hitte vpon the right booke: because such is either my dulnesse or preiudice (for I doe assure you, I will not be opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niatiue against that which I may discerne to be well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded reason, or sounde authoritie) that I stand yet as reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely perswaded as afore, this piece of worke notwithsta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>And albeit I wanted both fitte occasion, and iudged it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so (for the reasons hereafter touched) not worthe the while to say any thing to the vnconcludency and imperfections, which I conceiued to bee in that</hi> Treatise; <hi>yet was I neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse (not long since) moued, by those who may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde me, to take some time to answere it. Being sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified withall from them vnto me, that it was otherwise fully meant, to put mine aforesaide rawe discourse of these matters (euen as it was) vnto print againe, to bee made publike.</hi>

                     </gap>; <hi>I condescended to assaye, whether I coulde as it were licke ouer my</hi> discourse <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, into any more tolerable fashion: not omitting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, to answere the whole matter of the aforesaid</hi> Treatise <hi>seeming to me any way pertinent; yet not in the same order as it is there set downe, but in seuerall places of my booke, as it falleth in most aptly, after the method, into which I had first plotted it.</hi>

                     <hi>Of which whole</hi> Treatise, <hi>I trust I may (without offense) giue you a generall taste, by this</hi> Epistle. <hi>Truely I neither doe knowe, nor haue heard, who were any of the Authors, or who was the</hi> Enditer <hi>of it. If therefore it should happen that I did vse some measure (though farre scanted) of that libertie of speeche, which is vppe-mette, pressed downe,
<pb facs="tcp:19125:8"/>
and running ouer in the</hi> Treatisour, <hi>against many in place, (I doubt not) his betters, and of as great woorth and suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie as himselfe euery way; I hope that I shall not (iust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) be noted, to be caried with sharpnesse of humour against any particular person; but to haue beene prouoked vnto a moderate, necessary, and generall defence. Albeit I purpose rather to waye, what is fitte for vs to speake, then for him to heare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vnto the whole</hi> matter <hi>of the</hi> Treatise, <hi>these three seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall pointes might haue sufficed for a generall answere. The first is, that the state of the controuersie, or issue, is by him mistaken: the second concerneth his arguments; for he assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth that as graunted, which is not; which in the schooles is called, a fallacie</hi> petitionis principij: <hi>the last and third, is his</hi> sophisticall <hi>answering, euen to such obiections as him selfe frameth. For the first therefore; yee are to vnderstand, that in the</hi> Treatise <hi>it selfe, this seemeth to be the generall issue by him tendered, against which he would argue: viz.</hi> the forcing of oathes by Ordinaries and Iudges Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall, generally to answere to all such questions or interrogatories, as they shall demaund or minister, touching either the thoughts, words, or deedes of him, that is to depose. <hi>Vnto which in the title is also added ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther challenge, for that they are</hi> ministred of office, <hi>by the Iudges. So that he conceiueth erroniously all proceeding</hi> of office <hi>to be onely in causes</hi> Criminall; <hi>and in this respect alone worthie to bee chalenged, because it is done by the</hi> Iudge, <hi>without prosecution of a partie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nowe if hee doe reason (as hee pretendeth) against some matter practiced by</hi> Iudges <hi>and lawes</hi> Ecclesiasticall <hi>in this</hi> Realme; <hi>then by charging them with exacting of oathes,</hi> for men generally to answere vnto all their thoughtes, wordes, and deedes, that they shall be
<pb facs="tcp:19125:8"/>
enquired of, <hi>that I speake but mildely; it is a very vntrue, and slanderous imputation, both to the men, and to the Lawe it selfe. If it were mistaken by him through ignorance, yet was it ouer great rashnesse, thus to</hi> speake euill of such as be in <note n="1" place="margin">Iudae ep. V. 8. &amp; 9.</note> authoritie, <hi>especially for matters hee perfectly</hi> knoweth not. <hi>But if it were wilfully done, then must I needs say, that he peruerted and wrested the matter in controuersie of set purpose, to make the men and whole calling odious; and thereby to giue the better tang (in some mens tastes) vnto those Cart-loads of contumelies, and spitefull</hi> 
                     <note n="2" place="margin">The Latines call this <hi>calumni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> the Grecians, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> 
                     <hi>reproches, wherewith throughout the whole</hi> Treatise, <hi>it pleaseth him to charge both them, and their proceedings; as (in part) shall by and by appeare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the seconde point of the three: hee first defineth an oathe: then hee sayeth it is a part of Gods worship: hee telleth the ende and institution of oathes by Gods Lawe: and that they are either priuate or publicke: hee sheweth the necessitie of it in some priuate suites: and what things are to be obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by him that taketh it, and what by the Magistrate, that giueth it: likewise hee setteth downe (yet but in part) cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine cases, how an oathe is vsed in some</hi> Temporall <hi>Courts; and how it ought to be vsed (as he saith) by the</hi> Canon <hi>Law. All which, I will not greatly now trauerse with him. But hereupon hee inferreth, that the oathes</hi> ex Officio <hi>vsed in</hi> Ecclesiastical <hi>Courts, are against</hi> Gods <hi>Lawe,</hi> Common <hi>Lawe, and the</hi> Canon <hi>Lawe it selfe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>So that if he minde to reason out of those premisses, it must needes be gathered for him to this effect,</hi> viz.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the Law of</hi> God, <hi>in the</hi> Common <hi>and</hi> Canon <hi>Lawes, we finde oathes thus and thus prescribed, and vsed:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the oathes ministred in Courtes</hi> Ecclesiasticall <hi>tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching matters</hi> Criminal, <hi>are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to this prescription and vse:</hi> Ergo. <hi>They are contrary to those three Lawes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:19125:9"/>
                     <hi>I will omit that this reason concludeth not necessarily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> ex meris particularibus: <hi>because it might bee, that though sundry othes by those three Lawes were in deede of such forme; neuerthelesse other there may be also farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and yet both sorts allowable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But for answere I say, that the</hi> Assumption, <hi>or second proposition (which must be vnderstoode) is by the</hi> Treatiser <hi>not once mentioned, much lesse vndertaken to be proued, but is taken vp by him as graunted, which in trueth is flatly by vs denied. For it shall bee prooued (God willing) that there is no such</hi> contrarietie <hi>as is by him surmised, no nor great diuersitie betwixt the othes there ministred, and those, which</hi> Scripture <hi>mentioneth, or</hi> Common <hi>Lawe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiseth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now touching the last point of the three: Hee maketh it as a sufficient answere vnto obiections that may be made, for assertion of such othes as hee impugneth: if hee can but note any difference betwixt the things resembled together: though such diuersitie bee not in the point, for which the compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is made: no, nor in any other point, that is materiall. As for example. If a man affirme, that</hi> Christes <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond comming may bee compared to the comming of a thiefe in the night, meaning for the secresie thereof, and want of expectation; should hee well confute this comparison, that woulde thus say: No Sir, that is vntrue, for there is a great diuersitie betwixt their commings: because</hi> Christ <hi>commeth to deale iustly, but a thiefe to doe vniustly? But to come neerer home: If I did argue thus,</hi> viz. <hi>The receiued vse of the</hi> Starre-Chamber <hi>to deny men counsell, when they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to</hi> Interrogatories, <hi>is not against the Rules of</hi> Iustice; <hi>therefore no cause is there, why the like approoued vse in the</hi> Chauncerie, <hi>should be counted against</hi> Iustice: <hi>I pray ye,
<pb facs="tcp:19125:9"/>
should he reason soundly against it, that would answere it in this sort: Oh Sir, there is a great diuersitie betwixt those two</hi> Courtes: <hi>for the one proceedeth</hi> Criminallie, <hi>to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict penalties for the</hi> Queene, <hi>the other but</hi> Ciuillie <hi>for priuate amendes in equitie, vnto the</hi> partie? <hi>Or if hee shoulde answere thus: The</hi> Lordes <hi>of the</hi> Counsell <hi>bee</hi> Iudges <hi>in the one, but not so in the other? Considering, that in all things (being not the same) there is diuersitie; and yet a reason of comparison is concludent; if there be no difference in the point, for which it is brought.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If then the whole substance of that</hi> Treatise <hi>shall bee founde vpon discussing, to labour of some of those three in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities; so that (as himselfe affirmeth in the winding vp of all) he might truely say hee hath vsed but</hi> fewe proofes: <hi>I could therefore haue wished, that hee had not shewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe as</hi> Suffenus sibiipsi, <hi>by setting the Garland vpon his owne head, before the victorie; where hee telleth vs, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit his</hi> proofes by him brought be fewe, yet <hi>(saith he)</hi> they are effectuall. <hi>And thus much for the matter of that</hi> Treatise.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now let vs here also consider the maner of penning, and the briefe of the rest of his vnnecessarie wordes, which are wholly besides the matter. For the</hi> enditing, <hi>surely I doe esteeme it (for my part) to be a very commendable, easie, and flowing (if not ouerflowing) stile. Yet if I may be pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to speake freely, that which I thinke, truely it runneth altogether vpon an haughtie, comptrolling, contemptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, disdainefull, and salte minerall veyne, as may appeare by a taste of some particulars, not vnfitte to bee opened; which for order sake, I will contriue into these fiue seuerall heades: viz. 1. Of his discourteous and opprobrious termes vsed against sundrye particular persons and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings: 2. His couert reproching and wounding of all</hi> Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall
<pb facs="tcp:19125:10"/>
Iudges <hi>through the sides of</hi> Papists, <hi>for their ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging against Subiects, and treacherie to their</hi> Soueraignes, <hi>in former times: 3. His reuiling the proceedings</hi> Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall, <hi>which he there impugneth: 4. His vntrue imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and slander of these proceedings: And lastly, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended impieties supposed thereby to be committed, with the dangers and penalties, that hee chargeth all such to haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, which haue bene dealers in such practise of</hi> Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Iurisdiction.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the first of these: as where hee termeth all that pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise that part of</hi> Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction <hi>(whether</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries <hi>or</hi> Commissioners) <hi>by the names of</hi> Inquisitors, rough and rigorous exactors, and offensiue butchers: <hi>Chargeth them</hi> to cloake and shadowe foule matters vnder glorious and painted glosses, beautifull shewes, and fained pretenses: <hi>that of their</hi> Iudiciall Courtes and Consistories, <hi>this saying of the</hi> Poet <hi>is verified, viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Victa iacet pietas, &amp; tergo caede madentes</p>
                  <p>Vltima coelestûm terras Astraea reliquit: <hi>As if they had there murdered or vnlawfully put some to death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Where hee also saith, that</hi> Ordinaries challenge or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to themselues the goodly name and title of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall men: <hi>that they are men</hi> to whome the sauour of gaine is sweete, <hi>and therefore sayeth of them,</hi> Auro lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quente tacendum est.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Those</hi> Doctors <hi>also which by commandement do (as afore) seeke to iustifie the course that he oppugneth, he calleth (tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe contempt)</hi> English Doctours: <hi>a terme vsually sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened but vpon such, as beare the name of learned, and yet besides</hi> English <hi>(their mother tongue) perhappes vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand none other language at all: yet the meanest of such</hi> Doctors <hi>can tell, that a</hi> Publican <hi>differeth from a</hi> Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour, <hi>and that</hi> regula Iuris <hi>signifieth not an</hi> example

                     <hi>or</hi> precedent, <hi>at both which he stumbleth.

Peter <hi>were sorted: as if through their basenesse, a</hi> quaternion <hi>of them were not woorthie to be laid in ballance</hi> with a messe of such as himselfe is; <hi>or as though in a braue resolution of his owne single valour, he valued them by doz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens together, and durst encounter them all at once, like as the single</hi> Spaniard <hi>doth, with so many naked and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible</hi> Barbarians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>He termeth them also (in scorne)</hi> Learned Canonists: <hi>as if he would insinuate, that the litle skill they haue, were in the</hi> Canon <hi>lawe onely, which he nameth the</hi> Popes Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: <hi>and as if their degrees of schooles were taken in that profession. Whereas it is well knowen, that their profession and degree, is in the</hi> Ciuill <hi>lawes: a lawe being (for the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and wisedome thereof) by the space of sundrie</hi> quaterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of hundreths <hi>of yeeres, the common lawe of all the</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill <hi>nations of the world saue one. What he esteemeth of it, greatly skilleth not, but</hi> Tullie, <hi>a man more wise then he, doeth giue it exceeding great commendations. And all the</hi> Christian <hi>worlde (sauing ourselues) are not destitute of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, for well esteeming and practising of it. For the course of those</hi> Doctours <hi>education, it hath beene in the liberall sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, in the languages called learned, and perhaps in such of the vulgar also, as be of any commendable note, and in other sortes of good learning. Wherein if they haue accordingly profited, their employment (happely) may bee many wayes (thereby) as behoofefull to the seruice of their Countrey, as that which some call</hi> learning, <hi>is beneficiall and gainefull to themselues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Likewise the poore</hi> Apparitors <hi>that serue in</hi> Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall <hi>Courtes, he calleth them,</hi> their hunting Spaniels,
<pb facs="tcp:19125:11"/>
malepert Apparitours, Messengers and Pursuiuants: <hi>men though in meane place, and but ministeriall qualitie, yet as necessary to be had in those Courtes, as</hi> Errand-bailifs <hi>be for</hi> Temporall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To come to the second; may it be denied, that the matters wherewith he reprocheth the</hi> Popish prelates, <hi>of former times, are bent</hi> per obliquum, <hi>through their sides to wound all the</hi> Reuerend fathers, <hi>and others nowe liuing? who (for proceeding</hi> of Office <hi>against some of his darlings) are fallen as deepely into his indignation. For haue these sharpe biting termes bene bestowed vpon any of their late</hi> Predecessours, <hi>or vpon them, till of late yeeres, that certaine disordered persons ioyning (though in other respectes) with the</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes, <hi>to oppugne this Church, haue bene dealt with in the same course, that</hi> Papists <hi>are, and were from the beginning of</hi> her Maiesties <hi>reigne, before these other sprung vp? If this were not his meaning, for what ende is almost halfe his</hi> Treatise <hi>spent by way of Inuectiue against the</hi> Popish <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates? So that (no doubt) hee meant to lay vpon the present</hi> Iudges Ecclesiasticall <hi>the reproches of them, whose steppes hee chargeth them to followe, in that</hi> this course of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding was <hi>(if wee may trust him vpon his bare worde)</hi> brought in by the practice of the Popish Cleargie: <hi>And therefore hee sayeth, that</hi> Bishops nowe practice Antichristian decrees, and Popish Canons, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry heades of that Hellish <hi>Cerberus</hi> of Rome, and the synewes of his tyrannicall authoritie: <hi>For else this were but running of riot, and vaine barking against the Moone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Of this sort are those his other speeches also,</hi> viz. <hi>that</hi> the Papisticall Cleargie most irreligiously practised the same: <hi>that</hi> they finding it a fitte instrument to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine their Romish Hierarchie, and to tyrannize ouer
<pb facs="tcp:19125:11"/>
the consciences of good men, most impiously viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the lawes both of God &amp; man, imposed this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of corrupt oath vpon the people: <hi>that</hi> they were far more cruell then <hi>Claudius</hi> or <hi>Caligula:</hi> mad men, gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die &amp; deuouring Wolues: <hi>that</hi> they fed (with delight) their fierce and cruell mindes: <hi>that</hi> they tyrannized in cruell maner: <hi>that</hi> they forced men with rough and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous termes of disgrace &amp; reproch: <hi>that</hi> they were mercilesse magistrates vsing sudden and raging com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance: <hi>that</hi> they promised in <hi>verbo sacerdotali,</hi> if that be ought worth: <hi>and he calleth them</hi> vnbridled Clergie men, Pharisaicall Clergie men, vniust &amp; lawlesse men, with their bad practices and fond intentions: merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Ordinaries, with their extraordinarie and lawlesse power: <hi>their actions</hi> cruell and accursed dealings of Barbarous bloudy bishops, murtherous mindes and intollerable iniquitie of bishops, vsing a Barbarous course of inquisition. <hi>He inueigheth also at large, against their</hi> hypocrisie &amp; feined holinesse: <hi>against their</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall possessions, as the nurses of pride, presumption, and vaine pompe of the world. <hi>Truly if this kinde of mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likers, had that litle of temporalties which is still left, how hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble they would be may iustly be doubted: but I durst vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for them, that they will vse no great</hi> pompe <hi>in hospita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, nor in any thing els, sauing in words. Likewise against their</hi> ambition: <hi>for he affirmeth, that</hi> three Archb. infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced aboue the kings of the land: <hi>against</hi> vsurping &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croching vpon the kinges iurisdiction by Popish pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, to bring causes to their costly and lingering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistories: <hi>against</hi> bringing in (by them) of forrein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, corrupt canons, and ceremonies of the accursed See of Rome: <hi>against their</hi> claiming of exemption from taxes imposed by any other whomsoeuer, then by the
<pb facs="tcp:19125:12"/>
Popes authority: <hi>and against</hi> certeine clergie men, <hi>that (in former times)</hi> opposed themselues (with great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacie) against the paiment of a subsidie: <hi>as if lay men had not done (rebelliously) as much, as these did obstinately: Against</hi> haughtie <hi>Hugh</hi> bishop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> who <hi>(hee saith)</hi> as a lusty champion of that irregular confederacy drew out his woodden dagger of excommunication, against the kinges Iudges: <hi>against</hi> a bishop of <hi>Winche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> who was outlawed for a wilfull murther, and a while refused the iudgement of the kings law: <hi>against the</hi> Popes collectour who conuented the vicar of <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tash</hi> afore himselfe, for breach of an othe giuen for strength of a bond: <hi>against the</hi> Hospitallers and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plers, who drew the kings subiects into suite, before the conseruatour of their priuileges: <hi>And against</hi> the proud prelate cardinall <hi>Woolseys</hi> court legatine; and both his and <hi>Nixe</hi> the blinde bishop of <hi>Norwich</hi> his fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into <hi>praemunire,</hi> for encroching vpon the kings iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction: <hi>Adding also a slie surmise of some other things (in the times of</hi> Poperie) <hi>to haue bene vsed, which he doth but vainely imagine, to be now practised by</hi> Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners Ecclesiasticall. <hi>So that by this tricke of cunning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyance, he would induce and draw on his affectionate rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to beleeue, the same to be now in all</hi> bishops <hi>present, which was blame woorthie in any of their</hi> predecessours. <hi>For his fauourers may not iudge that such a man as he, would wander so farre wide (as he doth) from his purpose: belike if these now do but any one action (though neuer so iustifiable) which the</hi> Papists <hi>haue done in times past, they shall carry all the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tumelies, which they (in any other respects) haue either worthely, or vnworthely deserued. Whether this be a direct</hi> Christian <hi>course, euery one that is in any place of iustice shall most sincerely discerne; which will but consider with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
<pb facs="tcp:19125:12"/>
how vnequall he would iudge it to bee, to haue his owne honestie, discretion, loialtie, and religion measured and estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of, according to the actions of the worst men that euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore occupied the same place that he now doeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Vnto the third point (which is reuiling of proceedings</hi> Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall <hi>(in this behalfe) all such speeches of his, as these following doe appertaine: of the whole</hi> Canon <hi>lawe indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctlie and generally he speaketh thus: that</hi> they be lawes and ordinances contumelious against God, iniurious to Magistrates, and especially established to maintaine Antichristian tyrannie: <hi>Of an</hi> Oath <hi>of</hi> purgation, <hi>or an oath ministred to answere (in some cases) vnto</hi> Articles <hi>and</hi> interrogatories criminall, <hi>he saieth,</hi> It is against law and reason; an intollerable error and disorder: a fowle and great abuse: hard and vniust dealing: vndiscreete, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust, and vnlawfull forcing: offensiue proceeding: v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surped officious power, and licentious pleasure, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to all due course of Iustice: a violent course of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious inquisition, examination, and of wrested oaths: a lawlesse proceeding which the Iustice of the land de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testeth: that they be vniust oaths, and full of iniquitie: strange oaths &amp; strong purgations, not healthfull but hurtful: poisoning purgations, giuen for preseruatiues: Catholique oaths: a vicious and lawlesse inquisition: and lastly, a prophane, and more then heathenish In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The fourth point concerneth his vntrue and slanderous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations of their proceedings, who be</hi> Iudges Ecclesiastical: <hi>as where he saieth,</hi> that such generall oaths <hi>(viz. as afore hath bene touched, when I spake of the issue mistaken)</hi> are exacted, none accusation, suite, lawfull information, presentment or inditement iudiciallie preceding: <hi>that the Ecclesiasticall Commissioners,</hi> terme themselues high
<pb facs="tcp:19125:13"/>
and supreme Commissioners: <hi>that it is</hi> exacted by eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ecclesiasticall Iudge to satisfie his iealous suspicion of any crime, to appose by othe, and compell men to their purgation, or vpon euery bare surmise and vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rumour: <hi>that</hi> by the like reason <hi>(vnto the practise of this othe)</hi> there should bee erected a court of Inquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, more then Spanish, to sift and ransacke (by othe) most secret thoughts: <hi>That the Interrogatories vsed by Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Iudges are not certaine, but</hi> doe foolishly wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the doubtfull will of a slie and subtill apposer: <hi>that</hi> hauing snared the sillie subiect, they doe either (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst lawe) enforce him to accuse himselfe of his most secrete thoughts; or contrarie to Christian charitie, yea humanitie, constraine him to answere against his naturall parents, &amp;c. <hi>And that in defence of these abuses,</hi> diuers euen of the learned sorte, doe great violence to the Statute, 1. <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 1. wresting the same to a wrong sense: <hi>all which are verie calumnious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The fifth and last point of his lauish and loose speeches; concerneth the impieties, dangers and penalties, wherewith he chargeth all that haue delt in any such Ecclesiastical cause. As first, that it is</hi> a great and prophane abuse of the holie name and maiestie of God: that Gods sacred instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is thereby greatlie peruerted: that it is hurtful to the Church and common weale: <hi>that it is</hi> a great indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to the Crowne: <hi>that</hi> they vsurpe conisance of pleas: <hi>that</hi> they doe no lesse-then <hi>Thorpe</hi> sometime chiefe Iustice did, who (as much as in him lay) broke the oath which the king is bound to keepe towardes the people: <hi>that</hi> they are violaters of the king, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurious dealers against his Regalitie, Crowne and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: nay rather laie violent handes on him, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne
<pb facs="tcp:19125:13"/>
his royall throne and scepter contrarie to the policie, Iustice, lawes, customes, and freedomes of this kingdome; yea contrarie to the lawe of God it selfe: <hi>that hereby</hi> they impugne the royall preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiues vnited to the Crowne, with the breach of their owne oaths; especiallie if they haue taken the oath for the maintenance of the supremacie royall, <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hee maketh some doubt (as it seemeth) and</hi> aduiseth <hi>them of this danger,</hi> as a <note n="1" place="margin">Scilicet.</note> welwiller: <hi>that it is</hi> playne extortion and wrong vnto the partie. <hi>And lastlie, that</hi> they are all offenders, and doe incurre the forfaiture of the penall lawes of Premunire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seeing then his wordes of this matter bee so bigge, his termes so biting, his speeches so confident and peremptorie, and his accusations so grieuous: Is there not (in defence of Iustice and of so many good and great learned men in seuerall professions) great occasion offered to haue it examined; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the force and weight of his reasons will beare out this co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious haruest, and hote raging feuer of wordes, or whether these wordes were but vsed because matter wanted? What weight and moment his reasons are of, is not of this place par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularlie to discusse, but shall bee reserued to the seuerall partes of the</hi> Discourse <hi>following. And I will not striue by bare wordes to returne these of-scowrings of a fowle mouth and a defiled penne vpon him agayne; further then must needes cleaue fast to himselfe, the Authour of them: when they shall (by reason) bee wiped off from the persons charged, and so are to rebound backe, vpon their first owner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And to giue you an inckling (in the meane time) that it is not otherwise like, then to fall out so: It shall not bee amisse, a little to consider how gingerlie sometimes hee treadeth in this matter: and how here and there himselfe
<pb facs="tcp:19125:14"/>
minceth and qualifieth the state of the controuersie, as it were waiuing his first issue; notwithstanding all those his former high lookes and braue termes. For first he granteth, that</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers euen of the learned sort, doe hold, and that verie confidently, <hi>(meaning hereby as I take it, sundrie professors of the</hi> Common <hi>lawe) that these proceedings which he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugneth, are warranted by the Statute,</hi> 1. Eliz. cap. 1. <hi>and can he (whosoeuer he be for a man) shewing no more, yet see more herein then so many of the</hi> learned sort <hi>can, that be of an other iudgement?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And though he exclaime (as yee haue heard) mightilie, that this kind of oath is</hi> contrarie, and a stranger to the lawes, Iustice, and policie of this Realme; <hi>yet in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie closing vp of his</hi> treatise, <hi>hauing sayd, that</hi> it was neuer put in vre or vse by any Ciuill magistrate of this land: <hi>by the strength of trueth is forced to adde thereunto this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception: viz.</hi> but as it is corruptly crept in amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abuses, by the sinister practises and pretenses of the Romish prelates: <hi>thereby imploying, that yet it hath bene vsed of long time</hi> by the Ciuill policie and magistrates of this Realme: <hi>noting them withall, I know not with what</hi> other abuses, <hi>as being ouerrought, which belike they also shall heare of, as his leisure will permit him, if they please him not in the meane time the better.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Likewise, going about to answere the obiection that may be made, for iustifying of this othe by the like approoued course in the</hi> Starre-chamber: <hi>he vseth these wordes as a reason of his allowance of such proceeding there: viz.</hi> The Starre-chamber requireth an answere to matter in fact, done either to the iniurie of a priuate person, or hurt to the publike State. <hi>Then (by like reason) if</hi> Iudges <hi>and</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners Ecclesiasticall, shall but require this oath to answere matter in facte <hi>(as in very trueth they doe none
<pb facs="tcp:19125:14"/>
otherwise)</hi> done to the hurt of the publike State, <hi>then is the cause in controuersie thus farre yeelded vp by him. But can he (in deed) thinke it reasonable and iust, to exact such oath for punishment of an iniurie done but to a priuate person in his temporall goods, or such like: and shall it bee in his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vniust and vnreasonable to be exacted for discouerie and restraint of such enormities, which cannot be denied to be preiudiciall both to the state of the Church &amp; Common weale, wherein Iudges Ecclesiasticall most vsually doe practise it?</hi> Vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trà non desidero; habemus quasi confitentem reum.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In another place of the</hi> Treatise, <hi>he sharpely inueieth, for that the</hi> Commissioners Ecclesiasticall, <hi>minister the oath before the partie be permitted to haue the Articles. Now in his shewing of differences betwixt the proceedings by</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners ecclesiasticall <hi>and the</hi> Starre-chamber, <hi>one of them is this; that the defendant there, hath the copie of the</hi> bill of Information <hi>to answere by his counsell, ere hee take his othe for the trueth of it: yet hee restraineth it thus, viz.</hi> So the Information in the Starre-chamber bee not made <hi>Oretenus: so that it must hereupon needes be yeelded that at sometime, and vpon some occasion it may bee: and therefore it is not</hi> simplie vniust, <hi>to giue the oath before the defendant haue a copie: nor for him to be debarred from coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, when he answereth but</hi> interrogatories <hi>of his owne fact or knowledge. For (in deed) the defendant in the</hi> Starre-chamber <hi>is not allowed counsel, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he answereth to</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatories, <hi>sorted into</hi> Articles, <hi>but only is allowed counsel for the maner of framing of his answere to the</hi> Bill <hi>into due forme of law: the Counseller not aduising him in the matters of fact, least happily he draw the defendant into periurie. For it were very vnreasonable, that counsell should direct him in the matter, and as it were to say vnto him:</hi> answere not this thus, though it be true; for then you are like to be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouslie
<pb facs="tcp:19125:15"/>
punished. <hi>Nay rather, as a writer in the</hi> Ciuill <hi>law aduiseth: the counsell (euen to the</hi> bill of Information) <hi>ought to tell the defendant to this effect:</hi> Si hoc modo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondeas, perdes quidem causam: sed si aliter quàm ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas se habet, perdes animam.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Furthermore, in one place where he reprehendeth</hi> forced and constrained oaths; <hi>hee limiteth his meaning by these words, viz.</hi> in that generall maner: <hi>which is, as afore he had surmised: viz.</hi> to sift generally all a mans thoughts, words and deeds, and that without any accusation, or complaint precedent: <hi>so that it is not simply the vrging of them to take oath in a</hi> criminall <hi>cause which grieues him, or is to be condemned: but to doe it</hi> in that generall maner, <hi>for all thoughts, wordes and deeds. If then no such matter be (in very trueth) euer practised, the man (it seemeth) will easilie bee reconciled againe vnto them, whom hee so eagerlie afore snatched at, and tooke vp.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly, in one part of the</hi> Treatise <hi>hee speaketh in deed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> oaths in criminall causes: <hi>but it is with this taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue restraint:</hi> especiallie <hi>(saieth he)</hi> in causes of life and death, contrarie to the lawes of this realme: <hi>so that if it be not ministred in any</hi> cause of life and death, <hi>no, nor yet in any cause of mutilation of limme (as in very trueth it is not now by any court</hi> ecclesiastical, <hi>a thing most notorious) then there is no cause of offense giuen, either to the lawes of the realme, or vnto himself. And therfore for this time the</hi> Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiser, <hi>and those which exercise</hi> Iurisdiction ecclesiasticall, <hi>may seeme (in some broken maner) to bee growen againe to a pretie kind of</hi> pacification; <hi>hold as wel, &amp; as long as it shall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But there is another partie also, that perhaps will venture to rip vp agayne the seames of this greene peace, if hee may not (in some sort) bee satisfied. For there came vnto mine handes a good while after the former Treatise, certaine briefe</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:19125:15"/>
Notes <hi>(without discourse) that are deliuered abroad into many hands by writing; being commended to be gathered by a man of great reading, and iudgement in</hi> Diuinitie, I awe, <hi>and in what not? It beareth this title,</hi> Notes to prooue the proceeding <hi>ex Officio,</hi> and the oath and subscription which are now required, to be against the word of God, the ancient Fathers, and Canons of the Church, and the lawes, liberties, and customes of the realme of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland: the proceeding of Office, and the oath requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>though hee telleth not how he conceiues it to bee requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, (as the</hi> Treatiser <hi>did) doe both fall into this disputation, which we haue in hand. As for the</hi> subscription; <hi>(vpon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occasion) that may hereafter elsewhere be debated. The seuerall points which (in respect of the two former) hee hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, are by himselfe distributed and sorted into these seuerall heads: viz.</hi> First, testimonies out of ancient Fathers, that do mislike the proceeding <hi>ex Officio,</hi> and oath now vsed: <hi>Secondly,</hi> English Martyrs that haue refused and misliked the oath now vsed: Thirdly, the proceeding against heretikes in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, without exacting an oath &amp;c: Fourthlie, the Canon lawe teaching Inquisition and proceeding <hi>ex officio</hi> by oath.

Sir <hi>Thomas Mores</hi> reasons for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of proceeding <hi>ex Officio</hi> &amp; the oath, with sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marie answeres to them. 11. And lastly, Inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which come by the vse <hi>ex Officio,</hi> contrary to the common lawe. <hi>For proofe of some of which (especially the first) he is so plentifull in quotation onely of places, (without
<pb facs="tcp:19125:16"/>
rehearsing their sayings) out of the ancient</hi> Fathers, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels, &amp;c. <hi>that for mine owne part, I must confesse that vpon the first view of their names in his</hi> moster booke, <hi>I was greatly astonished, least I had too resolutelie defended a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter against such an armie of ancient</hi> Fathers, <hi>and as it were against the generall consent of the olde</hi> Primitiue Church; <hi>from which I meane not (God willing) casilic or rashlie to swarue. But when I had approched neerer, I well discerned this my feare to be all in vayne, in that they had neither ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner displaied, nor weapons bent against this cause, but rather against the faces of the aduersaries thereof: as may plainelie appeare in the seuerall &amp; opportune places of this simple</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course <hi>ensuing.</hi>

                     <hi>I may well resemble this dealing of the</hi> Note-gatherer <hi>vnto yong setters vp in</hi> London, <hi>as</hi> Apothecaries <hi>and such like, that be not at first well stored with stuffe: who to furnish vp their shoppes vnto the best shewe, are woont oftentimes to embellish them with good numbers of painted gallie pots, boxes and glasses, intituled on the outside (euen with golden letters sometimes) of such precious Waters, Oyles, Simples, and other drugges of medicine, which they neuer smelt of, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause such neuer came within them. And perhaps I should saue him from suspicion of a greater fault, (that is eyther want of iudgement, or of wilfull peruerting of the</hi> ancient Fathers) <hi>if I should freelie deliuer my conceite in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe: which is, that his leisure serued him not, to looke what was indeede contained in those places, which there hee quoteth: but that hee did set them downe (vpon trust) out of the</hi> Pies <hi>or</hi> Indices <hi>of the sayd seuerall bookes, wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the bare wordes of</hi> Inquisition, <hi>of</hi> Accusing, <hi>of</hi> Oath, <hi>or of</hi> Swearing <hi>was found.

any oath at all, (an errour holden by the</hi> Anabaptists) <hi>albeit being truely vnderstood according to the circumstances, the places serue neither the one turne nor the other) rather then that by any colour, they may be wrested to speake either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst</hi> oathes <hi>ministred in causes</hi> criminall, <hi>or against pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding by</hi> Iudges of Office.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F <hi>no Canon or Constitution Ecclesiastiall might now be put in vre, but such as her Maiesties expresse assent is first had vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;</hi> then do all their other opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>ordinarie iurisdiction ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall</hi> stand in no stead, and might be spared; because this would serue to cut off all at once, which they shoot at. For none that exercise <hi>ordinarie iurisdiction</hi> haue hitherto had it in particularity (which by the oppugners seemeth to be meant) otherwise then by permission of law, vnto euery of their proceedings. Neither in trueth, for the infinitie of it, and troublesomnesse to procure such assent from her Maiestie, for euery particular matter &amp; dioecesse of this Realme (from time to time) were it possible to be vsed. Now if <hi>Ordinartes</hi> (from whom either mediately or immediately, <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations</hi> do lie vnto her Maiestie in the <hi>Chancerie)</hi> by reason of the want of such particular assent, vnto the execution of euery <hi>canon,</hi> shall (according to this conceit) haue nothing to doe; then cannot the <hi>Queenes delegates</hi> neither (to whom <hi>appellations</hi> from <hi>Ordinaries</hi> doe come) haue any thing wherein to bestow their trauell: and therefore this point seemeth first of all meet to be cleared, and to be bestowed in the first ranke.</p>
                     <p>The absurdity of this opinion (whosoeuer were the hatchers of it) will easily shew it selfe. For if matters <hi>testamentary</hi> &amp; <hi>matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall</hi> (which all they grant to be <hi>ecclesiasticall)</hi> right of tithes,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19125:18"/>
and sundry other causes (which shall be also prooued so to be) shall not, ne can not, by reason of this want, be dispatched (as now they are) by <hi>ecclesiasticall iurisdiction,</hi> and yet can not be dealt in by any other authoritie, according to any law now in force: then is there a maine imperfection in the policie of this <hi>Common weale, viz.</hi> For men to haue a right, and yet no likely or readie meane to come by it: and for grosse oftences to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted (that are by law punishable) and yet no man sufficiently authorized to execute such lawes.</p>
                     <p>The iudgement of whole Parliaments kept in seuerall <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Queenes</hi> reignes (since that act, whereupon this fancie see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be grounded) so many as haue had cause to speake of the iurisdiction ecclesiasticall, doe also fully conuince it. The <note n="1" place="margin">25. H. 8. ca. 19.</note> statute for <hi>delegates</hi> vpon appellations, doth argue, that <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries</hi> might (without further leaue obteined, as in former times they did) execute their <hi>iurisdiction ecclesiasticall.</hi> For if there were to be no more <hi>ordinarie</hi> proceedings, till the king should giue his assent to the execution of euery canon; for what vse should <hi>appellations</hi> from the decrees and iudgements of <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> be there prouided for? Likewise <note n="2" place="margin">27. H. 8. ca. 20. 32. H. 8. cap. 7.</note> two statutes were not long after prouided in assistance of iurisdiction ordinary, and for the better and speedier recouerie of <hi>tithes</hi> in Courts ecclesiasticall, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the course of the ecclesiasticall lawes in that behalfe. And the <note n="3" place="margin">34. &amp; 35. H. 8. cap. 19.</note> like was also enacted for recouerie of pensions, procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations &amp;c. withholden.</p>
                     <p>In the time of <hi>K. Edward the sixt,</hi> in <note n="4" place="margin">1. Ed. 6. cap. 2.</note> a statute (since repealed by queene <hi>Marie)</hi> a great number of particular causes of <hi>iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction ecclesiasticall,</hi> are there (by the way) rehearsed; that <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries</hi> &amp; other <hi>ecclesiasticall Iudges</hi> might, and did then deale in.</p>
                     <p>In the time of queene <hi>Marie</hi> (before the supremacie was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto the Pope) the <note n="5" place="margin">1. Mar. cap. 3.</note> act for not <hi>disturbing of diuine seruice or preaching,</hi> reserueth the iurisdiction that <hi>Ordinaries</hi> then had, for punishment thereof, by <hi>lawes ecclesiasticall,</hi> ouer and aboue the penalties (of new) thereby inflicted.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Queenes Matesties</hi> 
                        <note n="6" place="margin">1.

                        <pb n="3" facs="tcp:19125:18"/>
The Statute <hi>De excom. capiendo,</hi> reckoneth <note n="1" place="margin">5. Eliz. ca. 23.</note> vp (particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) diuers Crimes and offences <hi>Ecclesiasticall;</hi> punishable by that iurisdiction, which were hindered much from punishment that apperteined, for want of due execution of that writte <hi>De ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com. capiendo,</hi> and therefore prouideth remedie therein. Which necessarily argueth the continuance and approbation of execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall</hi> by <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> without further obteyning of leaue.</p>
                     <p>By the statute against periurie (made at the same time) <note n="2" place="margin">5. Eliz. cap. 9.</note> it is prouided, that it should not extend to <hi>Courts Ecclesiasticall:</hi> but that offenders in periurie, or subornation in a <hi>Court Ecclesiastical, shall and may be punished by such vsual and ordinarie Lawes, as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore haue bene, and yet are vsed and frequented, in the saide Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Courts:</hi> which prooueth the vsuall practise of <hi>Iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall</hi> hitherto vsed (without any speciall assent) to be lawfull.</p>
                     <p>The statute against <hi>vsurie</hi> prouideth, <note n="3" place="margin">13. Eliz. cap. 4.</note> that such <hi>vsurie</hi> as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue ten pound in the hundred by yeere, shall (not withstanding the other penalties there newly inflicted) be also punished and corrected (as in times past) by the <hi>Lawes Ecclesiasticall.</hi> And by the <note n="4" place="margin">13. Eli. cap. 10.</note> statute of <hi>dilapidations,</hi> the remedies that by the <hi>Lawes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall</hi> were (afore) giuen against executors and administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of incumbents; are there extended also to donees and alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nees; to be (by the same authoritie) dealt with. In the which clauses of statutes, there is no repeale of any former particular statute or Lawe, nor any generall <hi>non obstante</hi> conteined. And therefore, if those <hi>Parliaments</hi> had bene of this iudgement; that no <hi>Canon</hi> might now be put in vre, without the <hi>Royall assent</hi> first obteined, there woulde haue bene added these, or some like words, viz. <hi>They the said Ordinaries first obteining the royall assent for the putting in vre of such Canon, as they minde in that cause to proceed by:</hi> that thereby (without all scruple of danger) their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings (so appointed to them) might haue bene warranted. But being altogether needelesse, it is no maruell though it were omitted. For can any man doubt (if it were needfull) but that there is a sufficient <hi>Royall assent</hi> had, when as it is giuen to the whole acte, before it can passe for a Lawe?</p>
                     <p>Lastly, the same statute out of <note n="5" place="margin">25. H. 8. ca. 19.</note> which (as I coniecture) this
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19125:19"/>
opinion was stirred vp, doth establish <hi>all Canons which be not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariant nor repugnant to the Lawes, Statutes, and customes of this Realme, nor to the dammage or hurt of the Kings prerogatiue Royall, that they shall now still be vsed and executed as they were afore the making of that acte, till they should be viewed &amp;c. by the 32. persons, &amp;c.</hi> which is not hitherto done. But such were vsed afore, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any expresse or particular <hi>Royal assent</hi> (from time to time) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined: and therefore may still be vsed without any such newe assent. For to exact it were (in very deed) to bring in a quite dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use of all ordinarie <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> Iurisdiction in stead of vsing it: which hitherto (from planting of <hi>Christianitie)</hi> and in all succee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding times, hath neuerthelesse bene practised.</p>
                     <p>This opinion, as an arrow shot vnaduisedly at the <hi>Bishops,</hi> glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth off them, and woundeth very deadly the fauourers of the new <hi>Discipline</hi> (in whose behalfe it was framed.) for they are so farre from taking expresse leaue of the Prince, to put euery of their <hi>Constitutions ecclesiasticall</hi> in vre, that they holde, <hi>her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie</hi> hath nothing to doe to make or establish any <hi>Church-lawes.</hi> And the clause for vse of such former <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Constitutions synodall</hi> afore mentioned, <hi>as they were vsed afore that time,</hi> will not helpe the exercise of their <hi>synodicall</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stitutions made long after in a Conuenticle, called together by their Moderators writ. But belike (when they set vp) the statute <hi>of submission of the Cleargie</hi> shall be turned into a statute of submitting the Princes scepter, to the rule of their Presbyterie in all <hi>Church-matters.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The chiefest colour and pretence <note n="1" place="margin">25. H. 8. ca. 19.</note> for this opinion, is taken (as I coniecture) out of the now reuiued statute made in K. H. the eights time, <hi>of submission of the Cleargie.</hi> But the wordes thereof doe plainely discouer the weakenes of such collection. for it is not enacted simply, that they shall <hi>not put in vre, &amp;c. any constitutions &amp;c.</hi> but <hi>according to their aboue said submission and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition,</hi> which was, that <hi>they would not enacte nor put in vre any</hi> new <hi>Canons, &amp;c. in their Conuocation, without the Kings royall assent and authoritie in that behalfe.</hi> Otherwise there were a flat contrarietie in the selfe same Acte, by reason of the last prouiso thereof (next afore repeated) where <hi>Canons</hi> already made (so they haue the qualities thereby limitted) are appointed to be vsed. For it is there said, <hi>shall be now</hi> still <hi>vsed and executed</hi> as they were <hi>before
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19125:19"/>
the making of that Acte.</hi> And where in <note n="1" place="margin">27. H. 8. c. 15.</note> the 27. yeere of the said King, the same submission and former Acte is repeated, there in the very body of the statute (touching not putting in vre of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi> &amp;c.) the same modification (as afore) is retained, viz. <hi>Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the said submission and petition of the Clergie,</hi> which concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth onely newe <hi>Canons.</hi> For of those that were then <hi>already made,</hi> the very selfe same prouiso (as afore is set downe) appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that <hi>they shall still bee vsed and executed, as they were before the making of either of those Acts.</hi> Which was, without any such expresse assent (as by this opinion is enforced) and is therefore neither requisite, nor almost possible.</p>
                     <p>I haue also heard some alledge the <note n="2" place="margin">1. Eliz. ca. 1.</note> clause of the statute, made for vniting of all <hi>Ecclesiasticall Iurisdiction</hi> to the <hi>Crowne;</hi> against the exercise of Iurisdiction by any <hi>Ordinaries:</hi> which (to mine vnderstanding) is a very simple collection. Belike they meane, that no <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> is vnited to the <hi>Crowne,</hi> but there must be a <hi>Commission</hi> vnder the great Seale (to warrant the execution of it) vnto him, that is to exercise it. Then must euery <hi>Stewarde</hi> of a Leete, euery <hi>Constable,</hi> and sundrie other <hi>Officers</hi> be driuen to procure like warrant for the execution of their Temporall offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, for (I trust) it will not be denied by these men, but that all <hi>Temporall</hi> authoritie and Iurisdiction, is by Lawe also vnited to the <hi>Crowne.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In deede this reason would serue against either the one or the other <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> if they were not deriued and claimed from the <hi>Crowne,</hi> but from some other authoritie immediatly; as the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Clergie did theirs from God, by the meanes and direction of the Pope. Yea euen another <note n="3" place="margin">8. Eliz. ca. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Parliament</hi> sheweth, howe farre this collection is from the minde of the makers of that Lawe. For that very clause <hi>1. Eliz. ca. 1.</hi> (together with her <hi>Maiesties</hi> letters Patents, directed foorth for confirming and consecrating <hi>Archbishops</hi> and <hi>Bishops)</hi> is brought, in the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble</hi> thereof, as a strong proofe <hi>without scruple and ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,</hi> that the authorities and <hi>Iurisdictions</hi> by them executed; be thereby giuen vnto them, from her <hi>Maiestie.</hi> And therefore this opinion doth remaine desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of any ground of Lawe.</p>

II.</hi> The particular distribution of all other causes to be prooued to be of Ecclesiasticall conusance, besides Testamentarie or Matrimonial, with a discourse of <hi>Bishops</hi> certificats against persons excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate, being a speciall point of their voluntarie Iurisdiction, where there is no <hi>partie</hi> that prosecuteth.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He next opinion, viz. <hi>That by the lawes of this Realme none Ordinary may cite any whomsoeuer, but in causes Testamentarie or Matrimoniall</hi> (though it draw deepe) yet it hath not so large a reach, nor draweth so great a compasse as the former. For this leaueth some ordinarie Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> in these two cases; where the other (vpon the matter) sweepeth away all. But if this be simply true, then the former must needes be false. For if (by Lawe) an <hi>Ordinarie,</hi> without more a doe, may cite men in these two cases, then may some <hi>Canon, &amp;c.</hi> (by Lawe) be put in vre, without any further <hi>Royall assent</hi> to execute the same.</p>
                     <p>But if it shall be prooued true, that <hi>(by the Law of the land) in some causes besides Testamentarie or Matrimoniall, an Ordinarie may cite:</hi> Then this opinion, that <hi>in no causes besides Testamentary or Matrimoniall, an Ordinarie may cite</hi> (being the contradictorie thereof) must needes (according to rule of reason) be prooued false. For it will not be denied by any, but in what cause soeuer an <hi>Ordinarie</hi> may lawfully deale, in that (if neede be) he may vse citation. All matters done by <hi>Bishops</hi> (who onely be immediate <hi>Ordinaries</hi> vnder her <hi>Maiestie)</hi> either belong to their <hi>order and degree,</hi> as ordeining of Ministers or Deacons, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmation of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, dedication of Churches or Churchyards,  or to their <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction.</hi> Their <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> is of two sorts: the first is <hi>voluntarie,</hi> that is, when those whom they deale with, doe not stand against it: (and such for the most part, are Institutions, probate of Wils, and committing of administrations, visitations, Certificats of <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> into the <hi>Q.</hi> Courts, ordeining of <hi>Reall</hi> compositions in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>ecclesiasticall, &amp;c.)</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But something must here be said touching certificats of <hi>Bishops;</hi> because none so fit a place hereafter doth fal out, for this matter. A little <hi>Treatise</hi> set out in the time of <hi>King Henry</hi> the eight, and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19125:20"/>
printed by <hi>Berthelet, cum priuilegio,</hi> (prouing that by the lawes of this Realme the B. of <hi>Rome</hi> had not, ne ought euer to haue had any supremacie here) doeth <note n="1" place="margin">Cap. 1.</note> thus write of these certificates. If (saith he) <hi>Excommunication, Bastardy, Bigamie, Deposition, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignement of a religious person, or Diuorce, be certified by a Bishop of this Realme, it is admitted in the Kings Courtes; but the Popes cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate is not admitted.</hi> And as certificates of Bishops be in these cases admitted at the <hi>common</hi> lawe, so haue sundry statutes since, authorised their Certificates duely made into the Queenes Courtes, in certaine other cases.</p>
                     <p>Neuerthelesse, I finde two cases in the said <hi>Treatise,</hi> where the <hi>Certificate</hi> of a mans <hi>excommunication</hi> from a <hi>Bishop,</hi> shall not disable the partie excommunicated from his action: as regularly excommunication doth when it is duely certified.</p>
                     <p>For first, <note n="2" place="margin">Ibidem ca 4.</note> 
                        <hi>if a Bishop be a partie to a suite, and doe excommunicate his aduersarie; such excommunication (though it be certified) doeth not disable his aduersary in his action.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, <note n="3" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                        <hi>where an action of debt was brought by an executour, and an excommunication vnder a Bishops seale was pleaded against such executour; this was adiudged no good plea: because the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour was not to recouer any thing to his owne vse:</hi> and for this there is alledged 14. and 21. Hen. 6. But if this were the onely ground and reason of such iudgement, then where this reason is not found true in facte: as it may often happen, if the goodes and chattels be great, the debtes and legacies small, and where the executour hath <hi>clausulam de residuis</hi> by the will, viz. all the rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the goodes and chattels bequeathed to him: it woulde seeme to me (vnder correction) that in such a different case, the lawe also should be otherwise: because much commeth to the executours owne vse in particular.</p>
                     <p>This certificate of <hi>exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munication</hi> by Bishops of all the others is most in vse: and would be of more vse, to the great co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie of her Maiestie (especially vpon the statute <hi>de excom. capiendo)</hi> and to the terrour of sundry malefactors: were it not for the chargeablenes of that course vnto <hi>Ordinaries</hi> (whom the tenth man that is certified, doeth not satisfie againe) and for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifolde abuses about the execution of that writte, committed by vnder officers: and were it not that, <hi>iura &amp; libertates, the lawes or
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19125:21"/>
rightes, and liberties of holy Church,</hi> graunted and confirmed by the <hi>great Charter,</hi> are not so <hi>inuiolably</hi> in these dayes mainteined; as was meant by <note n="1" place="margin">15. Ed. 3. ca. 3.</note> those actes of Parliament, which doe exacte othes for obseruation and defence of them.</p>
                     <p>It is a libertie peculiar to this Church of <hi>England,</hi> aboue all the Realmes in <hi>Christendome,</hi> that I reade of: that if a man stande wilfully fourtie dayes together excommunicate, and be accordingly <note n="2" place="margin">Nota interlin. pag. Regist. 65. b.</note> certified by the <hi>Bishop</hi> into the <hi>Chauncery,</hi> that then he is to be committed to prison, by vertue of a writ directed to the Sherife. Notwithstanding, that in one precedent (in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister)</hi> of this writ, it <note n="3" place="margin">Regist. in breu original. pag. 68. a.</note> is said; <hi>quòd huiusmodi breue nostrum, de gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia nostra procedat.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For a note in the same booke vpon the same worde (vsed in another writte) doth teache vs; that such clause is but vsed, <hi>pro ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nore regio, etiamsiad id de iure teneatur.</hi> And it appeareth by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie olde precedents of writtes there, that the graunting of this writ, is by lawe required: as where in a writ <hi>de excommunicato capiendo</hi> 
                        <note n="4" place="margin">Reg. in br. orig. pag. 65.</note> it is said: <hi>quòd potestas regia sacrosanctae ecclesiae in suis querelis deesse non debet.</hi> And in sundry other writtes of that kinde, it is <note n="5" place="margin">Ibid. &amp; pag. 66. a. &amp; b. 68. a. &amp; 69. b. &amp; 65. b.</note> affirmed to bee, <hi>secundum consuetudinem An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliae,</hi> which is the <hi>Common</hi> lawe of this Realme. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in other precedents of the same writte, the King saith <note n="6" place="margin">Ibid. pag. 69. a.</note> thus: <hi>Nolumus quod libertas ecclesiastica, per nos vel ministros nostros quoscumque aliqualiter violetur.</hi> And againe, <note n="7" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                        <hi>Iura &amp; libertates ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticas illaesa volentes in omnibus obseruari.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In these Certificates, the <hi>Bishops,</hi> and others, hauing in some cases authoritie to certifie (as the <hi>Chauncellour</hi> of <hi>Oxford,</hi> the <hi>Custos Spiritualitatis</hi> of a vacant See, and the <hi>Bishops Officiall, and vicar generall, ipso in remotis agente)</hi> that they make none errour; must remember to obserue these three things. First, that it be <note n="8" place="margin">Noua nat. breu. pag. 64. f.</note> expressed therein, that the partie against whom they doe certifie, is excommunicated <hi>maiori excommunicatione:</hi> because for the lesser excommunication (as happely for companying with an excommunicate person) a man shal not be imprisoned. Secondly, that <note n="9" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> it be certified, that he was by name and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly so excommunicated; and not in grosse, in companie of a multitude (as was often done in elder times) or indefinitely and in generalitie, as when the <hi>BB.</hi> excommunicated all, whosoeuer
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19125:21"/>
should violate any part of the <hi>great charter.</hi> For that excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication (saith <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> in that place) must growe vpon a spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall suite against a man either <hi>ex officio,</hi> or by a <hi>partie,</hi> whereupon a <hi>Significauit</hi> may be grounded.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <note n="1" place="margin">Reg. in bre. orig. pag 69. b. &amp; notainterlin. pag. 65. b.</note> (if any inferiour officer vnder the <hi>Bishop</hi> or his <hi>Archdeacon,</hi> did excommunicate the partie certified) yet must the <hi>Bishops</hi> Certificate runne, that it was done <hi>nostra autoritate ordinaria.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that the expressing in the certificate of a particular cause of the excommunication, is at the <hi>Common</hi> lawe (of necessitie) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; I cannot gather out of any place of the <hi>Register,</hi> or of <hi>Fitzherberts Natura Breuium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true, that when the proceeding is vpon any of the tenne crimes mentioned <note n="2" place="margin">5. Eliz. ca. 23.</note> in the statute, made for that purpose; the particular originall cause must be expressed in the certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate.</p>
                     <p>Neuerthelesse, when the proceeding is vpon any other crime ef <hi>ecclesiastical</hi> conisance, orin matters <hi>testamentary, matrimonial,</hi> or for tithes &amp;c. whether moued <hi>of office,</hi> or at the <hi>instance</hi> of the partie; therethe <hi>Common</hi> lawe (as it was afore) is reteined.</p>
                     <p>Nowe I finde precedents of these writtes in the <hi>Register,</hi> wherein no particular originall cause, but onely generall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed; which, as in other certificates of <hi>Bishops</hi> as touching ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stardy, &amp;c. the Court beleeueth, without further trauerse or exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. namely in sundry precedents of this kinde of writtes, is onely conteyned, <note n="3" place="margin">Reg. in br. orig. pag. 65. a. 66. a. 69. a.</note> that the partie was exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated <hi>propter suam manifestam contumaciam:</hi> but what was the cause origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of his conuenting, out of which such <hi>contumacie</hi> grewe, is not at all declared; and yet the certificates were allowed to be good in lawe.</p>
                     <p>Likewise in another precedent of the same writ, though some more particularitie be founde; yet is it left so generally, as the certaine and speciall cause cannot thereby be knowen vnto the Court, to which it is directed. For it is <note n="4" place="margin">Ibid. pag. 65. b.</note> certified, that a partie was excommunicated, <hi>propter suam manifestam contumaciam, in non parendo certis mandatis licitis sibi factis:</hi> but what those <hi>mandata</hi> were, is not touched.</p>
                     <p>And as these <hi>Certificates</hi> doe only in generality mention the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19125:22"/>
parties <hi>contumacies,</hi> and disobediences: so is there also a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent there, of crimes themselues certified but in a generality, whereupon a writ of <hi>excommunica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>o capiendo,</hi> was neuerthelesse awarded. For it is <note n="1" place="margin">Ibid. pag. 66. b.</note> testified that a Clerke excommunicated <hi>prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter manifestas offensas suas,</hi> was appointed to be attached, and thereupon imprisoned.</p>
                     <p>Notwithstanding this be a speciall right and libertie of this Church of <hi>England;</hi> yet is not this writte <hi>de excommunicato ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piendo</hi> alwayes to goe foorth, and vpon euery certificate whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer of a <hi>Bishop,</hi> or of other thereunto authorised; albeit the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate be contriued into neuer so due forme. For if he <note n="2" place="margin">Reg. in breu. orig. pag. 67. b. &amp; in breu. Iudic. pag. 39. 71. b. &amp; 72. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>s.</note> that did excommunicate, be himselfe for some supposed contempt to be attached at the suite of the partie certified: then shall the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the attaching of the partie excommunicated be respi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, till the other plea of the <hi>Ordinaries</hi> attaching be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: least otherwise the <hi>parties</hi> suite against the <hi>Ordinarie</hi> should be hindered by his imprisonment. Yet it is <note n="3" place="margin">Nou. nat. br. pag. 64. &amp; 65. f.</note> to be vnderstoode, that a <hi>Bishop</hi> shall haue <hi>Significauit</hi> vpon his owne certificat, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching an excommunication for <hi>contumacie,</hi> incurred euen in his predecessours time.</p>
                     <p>But albeit the certificate be duely made, and the writte <hi>de ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicato capiendo</hi> be thereupon awarded foorth: yet if there be loose or corrupt execution thereof by the Sherife, or by his vnder officers; both the endeuour of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and care of the <hi>Queene</hi> to haue contemptuous persons iusticed, are wholy fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated. Though this carelesnesse in times past were not so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as nowe it is; yet it <note n="4" place="margin">Reg. in br. orig. pag. 65. a.</note> seemeth by the <hi>Aliâs</hi> and <hi>Pluriès</hi> in the Register, that Sherifes, and their vnder officers were then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so slacke ynough, to perfourme this part of their duetie: howbeit it is testified by the Kings writ in this behalfe, <note n="5" place="margin">Ibid. pag. 65. b.</note> that the vndue execution of it, redoundeth <hi>in contemptum manifestum regis, epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi damnum non modicum &amp; grauamen, ac iuris Ecclesiae suaelaesio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem manifestam.</hi> In which regard, such a negligent Sherife is (by lawe) vpon a writ to be called into the Court, whence the writ issued; there to answere such his contempt.</p>
                     <p>The effect of the writ <hi>de excommunicato capiendo,</hi> (when he hath his due course and execution) is double. First, vpon the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry certificate of the <hi>Bishop,</hi> the partie excommunicated, is to be
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19125:22"/>
debarred action in all the <hi>Queenes</hi> Courts. Yet if vpon an <note n="1" place="margin">Nou. nat. br. pag. 65. d.</note> 
                        <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation</hi> by him made from the sentence of <hi>excommunication,</hi> he be deliuered out of prison; or haue a <hi>Supersedeas</hi> thereupon; then is he not to be barred from action in respect of such certificate, or of the sentence of <hi>excommunication.</hi> Secondly, the <note n="2" place="margin">Reg. in br orig. pag. 65. a. &amp; b.</note> partie is to be imprisoned by his body. <hi>Per corpus suum secundum consue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem Angliae, iusticies, donec &amp;c.</hi> This iusticing by body ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the custome of <hi>England,</hi> is committing to prison; and that <note n="3" place="margin">Westm. 13. Ed. 1. cap. 15. 5. Eliz. cap 23.</note> without baile or mainprise. Nither <note n="4" place="margin">Nou. nat. br. pag. 66. e.</note> doth the writ <hi>de ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine replegiando,</hi> lie in this case. Now a man being thus in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, I finde in law but two meanes of his deliuery. The first is, by submitting himselfe to the <hi>bishop.</hi> This submission may be in two sorts: either by present <hi>satisfaction,</hi> at or immediately vpon his deliuery; or by <hi>caution</hi> put in, that he will hereafter performe it. <hi>Quia vicecomes</hi> (saith a <note n="5" place="margin">Regi. in br orig. pag. 67. a.</note> writ in the <hi>Register) nulla inde facta satisfactione, aut praestita cautione prout moris est, de parendo man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datis ecclesiae in forma iuris, quosdam deliberauit; idcirco &amp;c.</hi> where we also see, to what end the <hi>caution</hi> (by the party excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate) must be put in, agreeably to sundry <note n="6" place="margin">Ibid. pag. 65. b bis 66. b. &amp; 67. a</note> other precedents of this writ, <hi>viz. de parendo mandatis ecclesiae, in forma iuris.</hi> Which is to performe that which the <hi>bishop</hi> shall reasonably and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to law, enioyne vnto him. For it was thought most incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, that he who had resisted the course of law, &amp; contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously persisted in <hi>excommunication,</hi> vntill his imprisonment; should now be trusted without good security first giuen, afore his deliuery. This clause of those writs in the <hi>Register, Fitzher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> 
                        <note n="7" place="margin">Nou. nat. br. pag. 63. c.</note> doth translate thus into French, <hi>viz. de estoier &amp; obeier les ordinances &amp; rules de seint esglise.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Vnder the clause <hi>in formaiuris,</hi> is that other part of submission conteined: which is prescribed by the law ecclesiasticall in this case of submission and of giuing <hi>caution; viz. de parendo iuri.</hi> This appeareth by that writ in the <note n="8" place="margin">Reg in br. orig. pag. 66. b. &amp; 67. a</note> 
                        <hi>Register,</hi> where a clerke im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoned vpon the <hi>significauit</hi> offered <hi>caution</hi> to his ordinary (the <hi>bishop of Elie) de parendo iuri;</hi> but yet could not thereupon alone be deliuered, for that he expresly refused, to satisfie <hi>tam de iniuria ecclesiae illata, quàm de contemptu,</hi> as the writ required. This forme <hi>de contemptu &amp; iniuria,</hi> is not only here, but in <note n="9" place="margin">Reg. in br. orig. pag. 65. a. b. 68. a.</note> other precedents also of this writ obserued, as they be recorded in the <hi>Register.</hi>
                        <pb n="12" facs="tcp:19125:23"/>
And in another writ by words more generall, yet tending to the same purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                        <note n="1" place="margin">Ibidem 65. b.</note> 
                        <hi>ad satisfaciendum Deo &amp; sanctae ecclesiae suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cientem exposuit cautionem. To satisfie God, viz.</hi> for his continued contempt of the keies &amp; power of his church: and <hi>to satisfie the church,</hi> aswell for the euill example and scandall giuen, as for the needlesse charges that he had put the officers vnto, to bring him to conformity. For it seemeth when a <hi>caution</hi> was put in onely thus: <hi>de parendo iuri &amp; mandatis ecclesiae, in forma iuris:</hi> that by reason of the generall conceiuing thereof, sundry tooke occasion to wrangle &amp; quarrell with that, which was after enioyned vnto them, as if it were not conteined within the words or meaning of their <hi>caution:</hi> and therfore that clause that such should <hi>satisfie for their contempt, &amp; for the iniury to the church,</hi> was often vsed in the <hi>kings writs</hi> of that nature, to auoid all cauill, and for more full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation. In such <hi>caution,</hi> two things besides are required: the one, that it be <hi>idonea &amp; sufficiens,</hi> as appeareth by all the writs in this behalfe, that be set downe in the <hi>Register:</hi> the other, that it be offered by the party, who is to submit himselfe. For it is <note n="2" place="margin">Ibid. pag. 66. b. &amp; 67. a. Nou. nat. br. pag. 63. c.</note> said in one of those writs thus, <hi>viz. Idem W. cautionem saltem pigno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratitiam (iuxta intentionem mandati nostri praedicti) de satisfacien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do de huiusmodi contemptu &amp; iniuria, antequam à prisona praedicta deliberetur, offerre debet &amp; tenetur.</hi> For a <hi>caution</hi> is not imposed by the <hi>Ordinarie,</hi> but is accepted by him vpon the parties sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and offer therof; when he seeketh to be absolued from the censure, and deliuered out of prison.</p>
                     <p>But what may be reckoned to be <hi>idonea &amp; sufficiens cautio,</hi> I finde not determined or colligible out of the bookes of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law. One kinde thereof which is <hi>pignoratitia,</hi> a <hi>caution</hi> reall or by gage, is mentioned in the next allegation afore. And in that it is there said, the party should put in <hi>cautionem saltem pig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noratitiam,</hi> we are thereby giuen to vnderstand, that the courts of Common law doe take knowledge of some other kindes of <hi>cautions</hi> besides this, and accounteth of this, as being not of the most grieuous sort of <hi>cautions</hi> vnto the partie.</p>
                     <p>The word <hi>Cautio</hi> is a terme taken out of the <hi>Ciuill</hi> law; for which (at the Common law) they <note n="3" place="margin">Nou. nat. br. pag. 63. c.</note> vse securitie or obligation &amp;c. therefore what be the seuerall kindes of <hi>cautions,</hi> must be taken out of that learning.</p>
                     <p>

                        <hi>Cautions</hi> in Ciuill law be of three sorts: one is <hi>Fideiussoria,</hi> as when a man bindeth himselfe with sureties to performe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, another is <hi>Pignoratitia</hi> or <hi>realis Cautio,</hi> as when a man ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his plate, or morgageth his land for performance, the last is <hi>luratoria cautio,</hi> as when the party which is to performe any thing, taketh a corporall oath to do it. By the <hi>Ciuill</hi> law, a Iudge is not bound to accept of this last, vnlesse the partie will also sweare, that he is not able to put in either of the other. And therefore where <hi>Ordinaries</hi> doe promiscuously at absolutions accept this <hi>Iuratorie caution</hi> offered <hi>de parendo iuri, &amp; stando mandatis ecelesiae, in forma iuris;</hi> they doe more then they sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply need to doe; and rather gratifie then doe any grieuance to the partie, as some haue thought.</p>
                     <p>For seeing this hath bin the most vsuall, nay (for a long time) almost the only <hi>caution</hi> giuen at absolutions; that they may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully still accept it, is made manifest by statute, <hi>viz. sauing and reseruing to allarchbishops and bishops, and all others hauing authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to certifie any person excommunicated, like authoritie to accept and receiue the submission and satisfaction of the said person so ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, in maner and forme heretofore vsed, and him to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue and release.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>5. Eliz. cap. 23.</hi> yet is not any of them so simple, but he will thinke either of the other two (if they be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered) to be better security then the parties bare oath; a matter so little regarded of most men in these latter times of this bad world. For <hi>satius est incumbere rei quàm personae:</hi> Reall securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is more safe then personall.</p>
                     <p>Now when such <hi>caution</hi> is offered as the <hi>Ordinarie</hi> doth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of, for the parties performance of that which shall be enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto him: shall he needs be forced to send for a writ of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuerance vnto the <hi>Chancery?</hi> No verely. For the <hi>bishop</hi> himselfe, if he will, may enioyne the <hi>shiriffe</hi> to deliuer him. <hi>Accedas</hi> (saith <note n="1" place="margin">Reg. in br. orig. pag. 66. a. &amp; nou. nat. br. pag. 63. c. d.</note> the writ vnto the <hi>shiriffe) in propria persona ad episcopum, &amp; ex parte nostra moneas &amp; efficaciter indicas, vt accepta cautione praedicta, ipsum mandet deliberari à prisona.</hi> And againe, a writ to a <hi>bishop</hi> runneth thus: <hi>Mandamus quòd accepta cautione praedicta, ipsum deliberari mandetis, alioquin quòd nostri est in hac parte exequemur.</hi> And therefore <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> 
                        <note n="2" place="margin">Nou. nat. br. pag. 63. g.</note> sayeth plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, that the <hi>bishop,</hi> or hee at whose certificate the partie was
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19125:24"/>
taken, may command the <hi>shiriffe</hi> to deliuer him out of prison.</p>
                     <p>But what if the <hi>Ordinarie</hi> shall refuse to admit of the <hi>caution</hi> offered, and thereupon to release him, albeit the <hi>caution</hi> be <hi>good and sufficient:</hi> shall the partie remaine still in prison? Nay, the writte <hi>de cautione admittenda,</hi> is prouided for remedie in such a case. This not deliuerance, after sufficient <hi>caution offered,</hi> may happen either vpon negligence &amp; delay in the <hi>bishops</hi> vnder-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers; or vpon his owne wilfulnesse. Vpon such vnder-officers delay; as when the <hi>bishop</hi> willeth them to absolue the party ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated: in which case <note n="1" place="margin">Reg. in br. orig. pag. 65. b. Nou. nat. breu. pag. 63. f.</note> the <hi>shiriffe</hi> is not to make deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, till it appeare vnto him, that the party is (indeed) absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Neither is <note n="2" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> such <hi>officiall</hi> or <hi>archdeacon</hi> bound to certifie the <hi>shiriffe,</hi> that they haue receiued letters from the <hi>bishop</hi> to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solue him: but the <hi>shiriffe</hi> ought to go or sen to them, to know the truth, and accordingly to make deliuerance. If it happen vpon the <hi>bishops</hi> owne wilfulnesse; in such case I finde two de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees obserued in proceeding: for first <note n="3" place="margin">Reg. pag. 66. a. Nou. nat. breu. pag. 63. d.</note> there goeth a writte to the <hi>bishop</hi> himselfe, that he admit of the caution, and also that he command the partie imprisoned to be deliuered; or else the king will doe that which apperteineth to him, in like case to be done.</p>
                     <p>But if this will not serue the turne, then secondly may the party haue a <note n="4" place="margin">Reg. in br. orig. pag. 66. a. Nou. nat. breu. pag. 63. d.</note> writ directed to the <hi>shiriffe:</hi> that in his owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son he repaire to the <hi>bishop,</hi> and on the <hi>Queenes</hi> behalfe monish him, and effectually require him; that taking first such <hi>caution,</hi> he command the prisoners deliuerance: and that if he shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse in the <hi>shiriffes</hi> presence to doe it, then the <hi>shiriffe</hi> himselfe (taking <note n="5" place="margin">Reg. pag. 67. a.</note> such sufficient <hi>caution</hi> of him) doe deliuer him. And if the <hi>shiriffe</hi> also shall appeare to be negligent or wilfull; the <note n="6" place="margin">Reg. 66. a.</note> partie may haue the like writte to the <hi>Coroners.</hi> But they must likewise first (before they deliuer him) take <hi>sufficient caution</hi> of him, <hi>viz. de parendo mandatis ecclesiae in forma iuris: &amp; de satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faciendo tam de contemptu, quàm de iniuria ecclesiae illata.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If the <hi>shiriffe</hi> be too forward, so that the <hi>bishop</hi> feareth that he will deliuer the <note n="7" place="margin">Nou. nat. br. pag. 63. &amp; 64. h. Reg. pag. 66. b. &amp; 67.</note> prisoner by coulour of some writte, without ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king such <hi>caution,</hi> as may be iudged <hi>sufficient;</hi> then may the <hi>bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop</hi> purchase a writ to the <hi>shiriffe,</hi> that in no case the prisoner be deliuered; except in his presence, he offer to the <hi>bishop cautionem
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19125:24"/>
saltem pignoratitiam;</hi> at the least a gage or reall caution, <hi>de sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffaciendo, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Shiriffe</hi> shall in deede deliuer him out of prison without such <hi>sufficient caution</hi> (which in the <note n="1" place="margin">Reg. p. 67. a. Nou. nat. br. pag. 64. b.</note> 
                        <hi>Register</hi> is thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed; <hi>nulla inde facta satisfactione, aut praestita cautione prout moris est, de parendo mandatis Ecclesiae, in forma iuris)</hi> then must a Writ goe foorth out of the <hi>Chancerie,</hi> for the new attaching of the prisoner; conteining also a <hi>Venire facias</hi> for the <hi>Shiriffe;</hi> that hee doe appeare and answere his contempt. For such his dealing, is there sayd to be, <hi>In laesionem libertatis ecclesiae, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptum manifestum regis.</hi> Thus much touching the first meanes of deliuerance of a person excommunicated out of prison.</p>
                     <p>The other meane for deliuerance of such excommunicate person out of prison, is when hee hath appealed to a superiour ecclesiasticall Iudge, from the sentence of <hi>excommunication</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen against him; as vniust, or as voyde and erroneous. For if hee rest in the sentence giuen, then must hee needs submit himselfe, and offer caution, as afore is sayd. But if hee holde himselfe to bee vniustlie delt with, and therefore will not submit: then ought he not to be enlarged out of prison, but vpon <hi>Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> made to the superiour Ecclesiasticall Iudge, who is the onely competent and able Iudge (in that behalfe) to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; whether hee haue bene duelie proceeded with, and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully excommunicated, <hi>Iuxta canonicas sanctiones,</hi> or not: as <note n="2" place="margin">Reg. pag. 69. b. &amp; 70. a &amp; b. Nou. nat. br. pag. 64. c.</note> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by sundrie of these Writtes in the <hi>Register,</hi> and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
                     <p>The reasons why such one is not to bee detained in prison that hath appealed from the sentence of excommunication, are first, because vpon the <hi>Appellation,</hi> the Iudge from whom it was made, doeth thereby cease to bee his Iudge in that cause. Secondlie, for <note n="3" place="margin">Ibid. pag. 68. a.</note> that the nature of an appellation is, to put the <hi>Appellant</hi> into the same state that he was in before the sentence giuen, for the doubtfulnesse that is in the meane time of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liditie or inualiditie of it. Thirdlie, by reason that where the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the <hi>Iudge</hi> to whom the <hi>Appellation</hi> is made, may be had: there the partie <hi>Appellant</hi> is (for the time) vsuallie absolued and released from the <hi>excommunication.</hi> Lastlie, least by his impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment hee bee hindered from the effectuall prosecution of his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19125:25"/>
                        <hi>Appeale,</hi> which may happen prooue to haue bene iust.</p>
                     <p>If allegation bee made to the court in his behalfe, against whom the Writte <hi>de excommunicato capiendo,</hi> is awarded and gone foorth, that he hath appealed: and yet it doe not authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>callie so appeare by <hi>publike instrument</hi> there shewed; yea (for the most part) euen where such <hi>publike instrument</hi> hath bene shewed: a <note n="1" place="margin">Reg. 69. b. 70. a. &amp; b. Nou. nat. br. pag. 65. b. c.</note> Writte of <hi>Scire fasias</hi> first goeth foorth to the <hi>Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffe,</hi> that he doe <note n="2" place="margin">Reg. pag. 70. b.</note> warne the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and him who did prosecute the partie imprisoned; to come into the court, and there to shew cause why the <hi>Shiriffe</hi> should not surcease from attaching him, or deliuer him if he be afore in prison, whiles the matter of the <hi>Appellation</hi> dependeth. In the same Writ also (for the most part) is conteined, that the partie (if hee bee taken) either shall bee brought <note n="3" place="margin">Reg. pag. 69. &amp; 70. Nou. nat. br. pag. 65. c.</note> vp into the <hi>Chancerie,</hi> vnder sure and safe gard, or else shall find sufficient mainpernors that shall vndertake for him bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for bodie, for his personall apparance in court at the day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed; also that he shall prosecute his Appeale, and that hee shall receiue and endure what the court shall thinke good to order him vnto; yea <note n="4" place="margin">Reg. pag. 70. b.</note> that his mainpernours shall safely euen redeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer him againe to the prison where he was; if it shal happen that the court shall so order it.</p>
                     <p>Now if the <hi>Bishop,</hi> when the proceeding was <hi>of Office,</hi> or the partie at whose <hi>instance</hi> it was; doe <note n="5" place="margin">Reg. pag. 70. a.</note> not come vpon the <hi>Scire fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cias</hi> serued at the day prefixed, or at furthest <hi>quarto die pòst,</hi> (vnto which day the custome of the <hi>Chancerie</hi> is to continue the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse) the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is the partie to be deliuered out of prison; so that it doe first appeare by <hi>publike instrument</hi> that he hath in deed <hi>appealed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Bishop</hi> 
                        <note n="6" place="margin">Reg. pag. 70. b. Nat. br. pag. 65. e.</note> and hee that prosecuted, either by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues or by their Attorney, doe come at the day prefixed; and hee that was imprisoned or his mainepernours doe not come: then a Writ for the <hi>reattachment</hi> of the excommunicated per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son goeth foorth to imprison him; vntill hee satisfie <hi>tam de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptu, quàm de iniuria ecclesiae illata.</hi> And likewise an <hi>Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for his mainpernours, to be brought into the court to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the <hi>King,</hi> the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and him that prosecuted; and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue what the court shall further consider. And this course of <hi>Scire facias</hi> before the partie be deliuered, doth seeme chieflie to be obserued; when there may be doubt made, that some cause
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19125:25"/>
may be alleaged (by those who haue interest) why hee should not be deliuered.</p>
                     <p>If no such doubt may be made, and when by very <note n="1" place="margin">Nou. nat. br. pag. 64. e.</note> 
                        <hi>authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call publike instruments</hi> (shewed foorth in court) his <hi>appellation</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidently appeareth; there sometimes without any <hi>Scire facias</hi> first awarded, a <hi>Supersedeas</hi> is directed foorth vnto the <hi>Shiriffe.</hi> 
                        <note n="2" place="margin">Ibid. &amp; Nota interlin. in Reg. pag. 68. b.</note> Neuerthelesse (in this case) the partie must within the yeere of his <hi>Appeale,</hi> by witnesses or othe; prooue his diligence in prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his <hi>Appeale</hi> with effect.</p>
                     <p>For there are precedents of such Writs in the <hi>Register,</hi> where no <hi>Scire facias</hi> before the <hi>Supersedeas</hi> went foorth, for any thing that there appeareth, viz. <hi>Quia</hi> C. <hi>appellauit</hi> A. <note n="3" place="margin">Reg. pag. 68. a. &amp; 69. a. &amp; b.

But mo or other means then these two, (for my part) I haue not hitherto found mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in any Statute, or any report of the Common lawe; though I haue carefully sought for them.</p>
                     <p>Now I will resume againe (after this long, but I trust not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarie digression) the second member of ecclesiasticall Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction; called <hi>contentiosa Iurisdictio.</hi> That is, when such matters be handled; against which some partie standeth, or is delt with thereby against his will. If it be <hi>contentiosae iurisdictionis,</hi> whether it be for a <hi>right</hi> there <hi>demandable</hi> and <hi>determinable,</hi> or else for a <hi>crime there punishable,</hi> (which are the heads of all <hi>litigious Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction ecclesiasticall)</hi> it cannot be intended, that <hi>parsrea, is contra quem res agitur,</hi> the partie to be delt against, will <hi>gratis</hi> without processe appeare, &amp; fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time attend: except it happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by collusion w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the plaintife. And in this respect (amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) it is said, that <hi>iudiciu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> redditur in inuitu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> &amp; <hi>Reus</hi> is called <hi>pars fugiens,</hi> the partie presumed to come thither against his will, and willing inough to be gone if he might. Therfore if any cause, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides those two, shall be proued such, as the Ordinarie may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deale in; it wil folow, that in such a matter also he may vse a

citation to call him. <hi>Dato enim principali, necessaria adiacentia ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niunt in consequentiam.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But that an Ordinarie may deale in sundrie other causes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides these two, it shall appeare both by Statutes (which are the iudgements of the whole Realme) and by the iudgements and vncontrolled opinions reported in the bookes of the Common lawe.</p>

                     </p>

Therefore it may probably bee thought that these opinions which hee speaketh of in this behalfe 37. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. either were meant in such a case, as grewe to a lay contract, such as <hi>Thorpe</hi> speaketh of in the booke of <hi>Assises</hi> (afore alleaged) or else there was some couenant for the money, by deede.

                        <note n="3" place="margin">Ibidem cap. 5.</note> And againe, <hi>the Kings prohibition shal not lie for tithes of a Mill, newly erected.</hi>

I must confesse, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I can see no <hi>seeming,</hi> nor yet colourable reason.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Whereas also for restraint of the malice of diuers, a prouinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all constitution was made by the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the <hi>Prouince</hi> of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> in their <hi>Synode</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> that such as hindered the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring or cariage of <hi>tithes,</hi> by due and accustomed wayes should be excommunicated <hi>ipso facto:</hi> It happened that a parson bringing his action in court ecclesiasticall vpon that constitution; was hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and staied by <hi>prohibition,</hi> suggesting that it was instituted touching <hi>debts</hi> and <hi>chattels,</hi> being neither <hi>Testamentarie</hi> nor <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniall.</hi> But the <hi>consultation</hi> 
                        <note n="3" place="margin">Reg. p. 46. b. &amp; 47. a. &amp; Gooddall of the Liberties of the Clergie.</note> granted, doeth signifie; that the court ecclesiasticall may lawfully proceed in that plea, so farre foorth as the action reacheth but to the <hi>excommunication</hi> of the partie, by reason of his hindering the <hi>Parson</hi> to gather and carie <hi>tithes,</hi> by places due and accustomed, so that the said <hi>constitution</hi> and suites ecclesiasticall thereupon brought, be both allowable.</p>
                     <p>Yet we are to vnderstand, that neuerthelesse in some cases, the suite for tithes doeth not lie in an ecclesiasticall court: as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, where it is otherwise determined by statute. For it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided, that <note n="4" place="margin">45.

                     <p>It was also <note n="6" place="margin">Plowden. 17.

                     </p>
                     <p>The <note n="7" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> opinion of the Court in this case then, further also was, that <hi>if the tree it selfe by that statute</hi> (being but an affirmance of the <hi>Common</hi> lawe afore) <hi>bee priuiledged for tithes, as Oke, Ashe,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:19125:36"/>
and such like; that the armes &amp; boughes also of them (being of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yeeres growth or aboue) shall be free likewise.</hi> And the reason is added, <hi>for they may serue for some vse in building.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that here it may be doubted, if trees aboue twentie yeeres growth, being of a kind <hi>priuiledged</hi> and <hi>timberable,</hi> as Oke, Ashe, Elme, &amp;c. be of themselues so little, so crooked, or so rotten, as that they can serue for nothing but blocks and fewell, and be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so so emploied: whether thereof tithes shall be paied, and bee demandable in a Court <hi>ecclesiasticall?</hi> For here the reason of that iudgement doeth cease, because they serue not for any vse in <hi>building, &amp; cessante ratione, cessat lex.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This doubt is also enforced by the opinion <note n="1" place="margin">T. 11. H. 4. fol. 242.</note> of <hi>Askham:</hi> who to maintaine the <hi>prohibition</hi> there brought (though the suite in the <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> court were for <hi>great wood)</hi> was driuen to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerre, <hi>that they were such great trees as might serue to build an house sufficient for any mans dwelling, according to the custome of the Countrey.</hi> Which allegation of matter in fact had not needed, if onely the kind and age of the trees had bene to be respected, to maintaine the <hi>Prohibition.</hi> But this question is to be discussed by the reuerend and learned Iudges.</p>
                     <p>I doe find a <hi>Note</hi> in the <hi>Register,</hi> but not set downe by whom nor when, touching immunitie of some things, from paying of <hi>tithes,</hi> to this <note n="2" place="margin">Nota in Reg. pag. 54. b.</note> effect, viz. <hi>Note, that the Iustices say, that tithes shall not be yeelded but of such things as bring profite from yeere to yeere, and that by the memory of man; but this is against the Decretals,</hi> saieth he. Now admitting this report to be true; what might be the reason of such opinion of those that were Iustices then, is not expressed; &amp; I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not coniecture. for not only the <hi>Decretals</hi> &amp; <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </hi> law, but Gods written law, &amp; before that, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> law of nature (vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such <hi>tithes</hi> were paid) do seem to be against it: &amp; those <hi>Iustices</hi> had not (for any thing I can find) either former written law, or any report of vn writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> law or custome to y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> effect.</p>
                     <p>And if this should be receiued for lawe, as is here in words laid downe; then need no tithes be paid of <hi>Sylua caedua;</hi> yet was it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in the Parliament at <hi>Sarum,</hi> y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they should: &amp; so <note n="3" place="margin">Reg. pag. 44.</note> it is at the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon law also. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither <hi>parsonall tithes,</hi> nor <hi>tithes</hi> of <hi>Mils,</hi> nor <hi>tithes</hi> of Licoras, nor of Saffron heads (being gathered commonly but once in 3. yeeres) nor tithes of corne out of fields
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:19125:36"/>
that lie fallow &amp; without fruit euery other, or euery third yeere; nor tithe calues or lambes falling of such cattell, as do bring forth but euery other yeere, nor tithe of fruit trees, that beare but one yeere in three. And if tame <hi>elephants</hi> (for cariage) were vsed as commonly here as in some other countries (which go with yong two or three yeeres together) by like reason no tithe of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might at all be demanded, because euerie of these are such, as bring no profite from yeere to yeere.</p>
                     <p>Where also is added, that this yeerely profite must haue had his continuance by the whole memorie of man: hereby would be cut of all tithes of grounds newly stubbed vp &amp; turned to good medow, pasture or arable, from great timber trees. Likewise all tithes of any new sets and commodities; as of sundry rootes, artichocks, osiers, woad, rape-seed, hoppes, French wheate, and such like, being in most places but of late knowledge and small continuance, were wholy taken away. And so were all tithes of grounds lately left dry by the sea, or by fresh waters, or wonne by the industrie of man.</p>
                     <p>The same <hi>Note</hi> further reporteth, that the Iustices opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> then was: <hi>that for tithes of pit-coles, quarries and other like, by no means a Consultation should be granted: because Parsons tooke tithe of the blades that grew on the ground ouer them, &amp; therefore they should not take tithe of the coles.</hi> This opinion (as it seemeth to me) that very <hi>Note</hi> misliketh in these words: <hi>But</hi> (saith he) <hi>by the like reason, a man ought not to pay tithe of agistment, because hee yeeldeth tithe for the beasts that feed in his pasture.</hi> But I doe not well conceiue the trueth of that which he here insinuateth: as if Agistment money were to be paied for the herbage of the same beasts, which by their calfe, lambe, wooll or milke, doe bring commoditie to the Church. Yet if he meane that tithe of Agistment money is to be paid for barren cattel, though they depasture in the same pasture where fruitful cattel do, &amp; at the same time; then doeth he come neerer to the purpose of confuting that reason, which implieth thus much, that seueral kinds of commodities in one yere, arising out of one ground, should yeeld but one kind of tithe. For if this were true, then where tithe of haie hath bene paied, nothing should be yeelded for the after-math (commonly being halfe the value of the haie) though it bee depastured with cattell,

which bring no commoditie to the church: then also might not the vicar of <hi>Tenham</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> haue tithes (as he hath) of the fruit of the great Orchard in Sommer, because he had tithe loppings of the trees in Winter, amounting to sundry loades of fagot.

                     <p>If to these obiections it be said, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is great diuersitie; because these examples do in deed import seuerall fruits &amp; commodities to be taken; yet either at diuers times of the yeere, or else arising out of seuerall parts of the ground: for replie I say, that the like may be also said of colepits &amp; quarries, for so much of the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d aboue as is digged, beareth at that time neither corne nor grasse. And albeit for coles (when men be come to a certaine veine and depth) they vse to dig side-long, leauing great pillars to support the earth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> falling: yet is it not the self same part of the ground below where they dig, that beareth grasse or corne aboue, and therefore herein no diuersitie. And with like reason might tithe of the seed of Woad be denied, because tithe of the leaues was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore paied: or tithes of Saffron heads, because tithe Saffron was paied the same yeere. Yea, if this note were assured lawe, then should no tithes be paied of any Minerals: as of lead, tinne, cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, quicksiluer, &amp;c. how it goeth in <hi>Cornewall, Deuonshire,</hi> and at <hi>Mendiffe</hi> hils in <hi>Somerset shire</hi> for tinne and lead, I haue not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. but I am assured, that in the <hi>Peake</hi> in <hi>Darbishire,</hi> tithe lead is the chiefest part of the Ministers liuing, in such places where it is gotten.

                     <p>The last cause of drawing an action for <hi>spoliation</hi> of tithes from a Court <hi>ecclesiasticall,</hi> that I finde, is: where the <hi>tithes</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, do amount to a <hi>fourth part</hi> of the yerely commodity of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19125:39"/>
whole benefice: because hereby, the <hi>right of Patronage,</hi> may be touched or preiudiced; which <hi>right of Patronage</hi> is to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in a court <hi>Temporall</hi> onely, and by no meanes in <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</hi> For so is it testified by <note n="1" place="margin">Lindwood c. aeternae sanct. <abbr>V.</abbr> iute-patrona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. const.

                        <hi>Lindwood</hi> himselfe, to be the olde custome of the Realme; and therefore the Common law of the land. But in another place he seemeth to be of opinion, that (this notwithstanding) no preiudice towards the <hi>Patronage</hi> can grow, though the suite for all the whole tithes and oblations should be prosecuted in court <hi>Ecclesiasticall. For</hi> (saith he) <note n="2" place="margin">Lindwood in verbo quarta pars bonorum. c. 2. Prou. const. de foro competenti.</note> 
                        <hi>the right of Patronage is founded vpon one of these three,</hi> viz. <hi>building, founding, or endowing of a Church. So that the right of Patronage doth no way respect tithes or oblations comming to the Church, but rather the building of it, the ground whereon it is situate, or the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowment (as of glebe &amp;c.) assigned vnto it.</hi> This he writeth <hi>saluo iudicio meliori:</hi> and vnder the same reseruation, I do holde, that where a great part of tithes is (by suite) euicted from one Church vnto another; the very patronage it selfe is much preiudiced and endamaged. For if the Patron happen to sell it, the lesse value the benefice is of, the lesse recompence shall he haue for it. Besides, if <note n="3" place="margin">Stat. circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectè agatis.</note> a <hi>pension</hi> be assigned out of the benefice vnto the <hi>Patron</hi> (as it may be <note n="4" place="margin">Lindwood, vbi supra. <abbr>V.</abbr> pensio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</note> vpon the foundation) the more the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is empaired, the more hard will the <hi>pension</hi> be to recouer. Lastly, for somuch as the Clerke presented is (by law) bound to relieue his <hi>Patron</hi> fallen in decay: in this respect, great preiudice groweth to the <hi>Patron,</hi> when a <hi>fourth</hi> or greater part of the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice is euicted.</p>
                     <p>That which <hi>Markham</hi> held (as is aforesaid) <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>if any part of right of tithes doe come in debate betwixt two Patrons, there the Court ecclesiasticall could not holde plea:</hi> seemeth to be borro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed from a <hi>consultation</hi> in the <note n="5" place="margin">Reg. pag. 46. a.</note>

In the former whereof is said: <note n="3" place="margin">2. H. 4. ca. 15.</note> that <hi>the Dioecesans of the Realme, cannot by their Iurisdiction Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, without ayde of the Royall Maiestie, sufficiently correct nor restreine the malice of Heretickes; because they goe from Dioecesse to Dioecesse, and willnot appeare before the Dioecesans, but contemne the keyes of the Church, and censures of the same, &amp;c.</hi> And in the <note n="4" place="margin">2.

H. 8. c. 14</note> Statute then those, whereby it was prouided; that <hi>euery person being presented or indicted of any Heresie, or duely accused or detected thereof by two lawfull witnesses at the least, to any Ordinaries, &amp;c. might by them bee proceeded against, &amp;c. and none otherwise.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neither is it materiall, though the said three statutes do stand repealed; for they shew (neuerthelesse) touching <hi>Heresie;</hi> what then was, and now is still at the <hi>Common</hi> Lawe. which offence to be still punishable at the <hi>Common</hi> Lawe, doeth also more plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare by the statute of <hi>Citations,</hi> being stil in force. For there it is prouided, that (the said statute notwithstanding) <note n="6" place="margin">23. H. 8. c. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop may cite and summon any person of his prouince for cause of Heresie, if the immediate Ordinarie doe consent, or doe not his due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and that the prerogatiue of the Archbishop of Canterburie shall not be preiudiced by that Statute.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The like is testified of <hi>breach of an oathe,</hi> and of <hi>periurie</hi> in an <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> Court or matter. For after that (amongst diuers other matters) in the statute of <note n="7" place="margin">Circumspectè agatis. 13. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1.</note>

                     <p>By bookes of the <hi>Common</hi> Lawe, I finde two cases, wherein <hi>breach of othe</hi> called <hi>laesio fidei,</hi> in an othe voluntarily taken, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther priuately, or before an <hi>Ecclesiasticall Iudge</hi> (as was in those dayes much vsed) is to be determined in the <hi>Temporall,</hi> and not in the <hi>Ecclesiasticall Court.</hi> The one is such as fell out in the case of the vicar of <hi>Saltash;</hi> who had made an <hi>Obligation,</hi> and had bound it by an <hi>othe</hi> (that he would not goe against it) before the <hi>Popes collector in England;</hi> who pretended (though vniustly) some <hi>Iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall</hi> in himselfe.

                     <p>The effect of it (to this purpose) is: that whereas <hi>Prelats</hi> doe take Conisance of sinnes and of misdemeanours of such as be vnder their <hi>Iurisdiction;</hi> as of <hi>Periurie,</hi> or <hi>breache of faith,</hi> of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criledge,</hi> of <hi>violation of Church liberties,</hi> (for infringing of which, euen by the <hi>Kings Charter</hi> graunted to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> such disturbers doe fall into Excommunication <hi>ipso facto)</hi> and of such like causes which be meerely of <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Conisance: yet are <hi>prohibitions</hi> directed foorth out of the <hi>Kings</hi> Court; and Iudges <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> are called thither to answere; as if they delt not concerning <hi>Periurie and breach of faith;</hi> but suggesting that they deale touching <hi>chattels.</hi> Therefore a little after, is added this, viz. <note n="3" place="margin">Dicta.

                     <p>Yea, and <hi>Lindwood,</hi> who writ <hi>anno</hi> 1423, and long after that writ was framed (who also by reason he was <hi>Officiall principall</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> or <hi>Deane of the Arches,</hi> had good experience in these causes) maketh no <note n="1" place="margin">Lindw. ibidem <abbr>V.</abbr> periurio.</note> doubt; but that matter of <hi>periury</hi> or of <hi>breach of faith,</hi> arising vpon what cause soeuer, so farre foorth as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth doubt, whether such <hi>oath</hi> were lawfull or not, and doe binde in conscience, or not; is of ecclesiasticall conisance.

                     </p>
                     <p>To the same purpose also <hi>Mordant</hi> said in the time of K. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> the seuenth, <note n="2" place="margin">T. 12.

vpon a temporall cause.</hi> Adding for proofe of his saying, that <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe had a matter vpon the like reason ruled for him, and against the Archbishop of Canterbury, H.</hi> 14. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>par attachment sur Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, &amp;c. de ceo que il suist en court Christian, pur diffamation.</hi> The matter then was not ruled against the <hi>Archbishop</hi> simply, for su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>diffamation</hi> there; but of such a kinde of <hi>diffamation.</hi> For else this would not haue fitted the purpose of <hi>Hankefords</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: because hee hauing to prooue that <hi>laesio fidei</hi> arising vpon a <hi>Temporall</hi> cause might not bee sued in an <hi>ecclesiasticall court:</hi> could not make any colour of that assertion, by allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of a iudgement that no <hi>diffamation</hi> at all might bee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted there: for that is not the like reason. And therefore, as that <hi>laesio fidei</hi> arose on a <hi>Temporall</hi> cause; so did the <hi>diffama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> there spoken of, for which a <hi>prohibition</hi> did lie without <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That <hi>diffamatorie</hi> words touching a <hi>temporall</hi> cause may not be sued in court <hi>ecclesiasticall;</hi> we haue also a prohibition <note n="1" place="margin">Regist. fol. 42. b</note> in the <hi>Register,</hi> without any <hi>Consultation</hi> granted. For whereas one gaue witnesse in an <hi>Inquisition</hi> made by the king about his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change in <hi>Yorke:</hi> the partie touched, sued the witnesse (for dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faming him) in a court <hi>ecclesiasticall,</hi> whereupon the witnesse brought a <hi>Prohibition,</hi> by reason the matter was a <hi>Temporall</hi> cause.</p>
                     <p>By Statute likewise it is <note n="2" place="margin">Ed. 3. c. 11.</note> enacted, that <hi>a Prohibition shall lie, if a man be sued in court ecclesiasticall for diffamation, in that hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited the other.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I finde also another cause, why some <hi>diffamation</hi> may not be sued in a court Ecclesiasticall: and that is, when action there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lieth at the <hi>Common</hi> lawe. As <note n="3" place="margin">P. 18. Ed. 4. fol. 6.</note> where <hi>a man brought Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of trespasse for goods taken away; the defendant hereupon sued him in a spirituall Court for diffamation. But</hi> Hussey <hi>the kings At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turney, in behalfe of the Plaintife desired a Prohibition; because the plea in Court Christian was mooued, the suite hanging there: and had it graunted.</hi> Quod nota. <hi>So if I be robbed, and speake of him that robbed mee before others, so that hee sueth mee in a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall court for diffamation; there lieth a Prohibition: because I
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19125:46"/>
may haue an Action at the Common lawe,</hi> videlicet, <hi>mine appeale of the robberie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There be also in the booke of <note n="1" place="margin">Booke of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, tit. Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.</note>

                     <p>So that wee may conclude this point, that out of the cases excepted; the rule of <hi>Circumspecte agatis,</hi> and <hi>Articuli Cleri</hi> (for <hi>diffamation</hi> to bee of ecclesiasticall conisance) hath place, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen by allowance of the common lawe.</p>
                     <p>There resteth yet one point belonging to this place; fit to be cleared. There is alleaged for other purposes by the <hi>Note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatherer,</hi> a little olde printed <hi>Treatise, Concerning the power of the Clergie, and lawes of the Realme.</hi> In which, the Statute of <hi>Circumspectè agatis</hi> (both here and elsewhere by me alleaged) is auouched to bee <hi>no Statute,</hi> but <hi>a bare constitution.</hi> The words <note n="2" place="margin">Of the power of the Clergie and lawes of the realme, cap. 8.</note> bee these: <hi>Wee neuer sawe any proofe that Circumspectè agatis, was a Statute, or taken out of the kings answeres. and there bee in the sayd treatise diuers things that bee directlie agaynst the lawes of the Realme as it is in this point. That Prelates for fornication, auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie and such other, may sometime assigne bodilie paine, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time pecuniarie payne. And the lawe is, that Prelates shall neuer assigne pecuniarie payne for correction of sinne, but onely at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of the partie. And also it is recited in the sayd Treatise, that if the Prelate of any Church, or his Aduocate, aske of the person a pension; that the suite should bee in the Spirituall Courte: and the lawe of the Realme is euen to the contrarie. And we thinke, that if it had bene a Statute; that the lawe should neuer haue bene vsed therein, so directlie agaynst the Statute, as it hath bene vsed. And in the nineteenth yeere of King</hi> Edward <hi>the third, in a Writte of Annuitie brought in the Kings Court against the sayd Article of the sayd Treatise: it is sayd, that the sayd Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise is no Statute, but named so to bee by the Prelates. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so the sayde Writte of Annuitie is iudged to bee maintenable in the Kings Courte, and that is directlie agaynst the Treatise of Circumspectè agatis, wherefore wee thinke it is no Statute.</hi>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:19125:47"/>
The verie like wordes are also vsed (I thinke all by one Author) in <note n="1" place="margin">Ibid. cap. 8.</note> another <hi>Treatise of constitutions Prouinciall and Legatine.</hi>
                     </p>

As though statutes (for the most part) bee not to the restraining and changing of the lawe of the realme.</p>
                     <p>His first speciall obiection doeth answere it selfe. For if the <hi>Partie</hi> desire commutation of <hi>corporall</hi> penance into <hi>pecuniarie,</hi> especially if he be a free man; the <hi>Ordinarie</hi> may lawfully accept of that <hi>commutation,</hi> and being so vnderstood, <hi>circumspectè agatis;</hi> iumpeth therein both with <note n="2" place="margin">Articuli Cleri. 9.

                     <p>Touching his second obiection against it, of a <hi>pension:</hi> I referre my selfe to that which hereof hath bene spoken in the 6. Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this first part.

                     <p>But I find two cases where laying violent hands on a Clerke, shall not bee sued in a Court Ecclesiasticall, but there will lie a prohibition. The first is, <hi>If a Clerke be</hi>

                        <hi>when a man is excommunicate for laying violent hands on a Clerke, if the spirituall Court denie absolution till amends bee made to the partie for the batterie, a prohibition also will be granted: because it shall be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, he which sueth, doeth it to recouer damages.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But (though it be at the suite of the partie) if onely the <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi> of the offence, and not any <hi>amends</hi> be sued for, it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminable in a <hi>Court ecclesiasticall,</hi> albeit the <note n="4" place="margin">Art.

                     <p>That <hi>Sequestration</hi> is another censure ecclesiasticall, and the conisance of the violation thereof of that iurisdiction, is prooued cleerely by a consultation in the Register.

                     <p>Now follow (in this place) certeine crimes of <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> conusance: and first such, as be contrary to <hi>pietie</hi> towards God; namely <hi>blasphemie,</hi> which <note n="2" place="margin">c. 2. de maled.</note> though in partes on the other side Sea (where <hi>Ciuill</hi> law hath place) it be <hi>mixti fori,</hi> that is, enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and punishable aswell in the <hi>temporall</hi> as in the <hi>ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> court: yet in this Realme, I haue not learned of any punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof (or for swearing) by any <hi>temporall</hi> power.

                     <p>But we are to vnderstand (as <note n="4" place="margin">Lindwood in c. circumspectè. de foro competenti. <abbr>V.</abbr> mort. peccato.</note>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He thirde opinion nowe followeth, which is: that by the Lawes of the <hi>Realme, no Layman ought to be summoned or cited to make</hi> (or take, as I thinke is meant) <hi>an othe, in any other cause then Testamentary or Matrimoniall.</hi> This diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth from the former in two points. The first is in the <hi>partie</hi> to be <hi>cited:</hi> For the second opinion was, that <hi>none whosoeuer,</hi> including both <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> and <hi>Lay:</hi> where as this is onely, that <hi>no Lay man may be cited, &amp;c.</hi> The second difference is in the end of the <hi>citation:</hi> For here is said: <hi>a lay man may not be cited to take an oth</hi> in any other cause: thereby leauing (as it might seeme) the <hi>Ordinary</hi> at large, to vrge persons <hi>ecclesiastical</hi> to take an <hi>othe,</hi> in other causes also. But all comes to one ende. For if neither <hi>Lay</hi> nor <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> (as the second opinion holdeth) may be <hi>cited</hi> in any other cause: then cannot <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> men be cited in any other cause, to take an <hi>othe.</hi> That which cannot be done at all, cannot be done for any ende. <hi>non entis nullae sunt
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:19125:52"/>
qualitates.</hi> so that both these runne to one point, sauing that hereby is affirmed, a <hi>citation</hi> may not be made to the intent a <hi>Lay</hi> man shall take an <hi>othe,</hi> sauing in those two cases.</p>
                     <p>Now if this <hi>citing</hi> be meant of the <hi>partie</hi> defendant; then doth it not impugne any proceeding <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> in vse. for the partie conuented, is not cited <hi>ad subeundum iuramentum,</hi> but <hi>ad respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum tali in causa decimarum, &amp;c. &amp; faciendum vlteriùs quod iuris fuerit &amp; rationis.</hi> If it be meant of witnesses, neither are they <hi>cited</hi> (against their will) not so much as in <hi>Testamentarie</hi> or <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniall</hi> causes, or any other, to appeare; till faith be made by the <hi>partie,</hi> or by some other for him, that they take them to be <hi>necessary witnesses</hi> for to testifie in that cause; and that being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and their reasonable charges offered them, they doe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse without cause refuse to come, and to testifie a trueth. For then goeth a <hi>citation</hi> called <hi>Compulsories</hi> for them, <hi>sub poena iuris</hi> to come and depose their knowledges in such a matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt such <hi>parties.</hi> So that the <hi>citation</hi> is not <hi>ad subeundum iura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum,</hi> albeit when they come, they are not to set downe any deposition, but vpon <hi>othe:</hi> because it is <hi>iuris diuini, naturalis, &amp; gentium, quòd non credatur testi iniurato.</hi> Also the <hi>Authour</hi> of this opinion should haue done well, to haue signified whether a <hi>Lay</hi> man being come thither without <hi>citation,</hi> might then be vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to take an <hi>othe.</hi> Therefore if the <hi>Authour</hi> hereof, wil here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by maintaine any controuersie against <hi>Courts Ecclesiasticall;</hi> the issue must be, either that to make the <hi>Defendant</hi> put in his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere vpon his <hi>othe,</hi> (so farre foorth as he by Lawe is bound) or to make <hi>witnesses</hi> testifie vpon their <hi>othe,</hi> is a thing contrary to the Lawes ofthe <hi>Realme.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But it appeareth by discourse vpon the former opinion, in how many sundry causes of <hi>litigious Iurisdiction,</hi> (besides <hi>Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie</hi> and <hi>Matrimoniall) Ordinaries</hi> may holde <hi>Plea</hi> (by the Lawes of this <hi>Realme)</hi> according to the course of the <hi>Queenes ecclesiasticall</hi> Lawes. That the <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> Lawes doe require this course (with the cautions aforesaide,) I thinke no man that knowes any thing in that Lawe, will make doubt. A <hi>Plea</hi> is a conflict in cause of Iudgement, betwixt one that affirmeth, and another that denieth. There be but two wayes (besides the <hi>parties confession,</hi> which is not properly called a proofe) to
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19125:53"/>
prooue any thing: that is, by <hi>witnesses,</hi> or by a <hi>publicke instrument,</hi> called by the <hi>Common</hi> Lawe, <hi>matter of Record.</hi> Now if witnesses might not be vrged to testifie vpon <hi>othe,</hi> in any causes but <hi>Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie</hi> or <hi>Matrimoniall;</hi> then could no <hi>Plea</hi> be holden in any other cause, when the chiefest and most vsuall meanes of proofe in recent facts, be taken away.</p>
                     <p>This libertie and priuiledge of holding <hi>Plea</hi> in the causes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore shewed, and in this maner as is now claimed, <note n="1" place="margin">24. H. 8. c. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>by the goodnes of Princes of this Realme, and by the Lawes and customes of the same</hi> (as a statute rehearseth) <hi>appertaineth to the Spirituall Iurisdiction of this Realme,</hi> and hath bene in all ages, vsed in <hi>Courtes Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall</hi> without impeachment, as by the Recordes thereof may appeare. And therefore, vpon any singular conceite (newly taken vp by some priuate persons) it is not safe to be nowe thus questioned, and oppugned. There is an olde Statute in force (as I take it) that may greatly bridle such newe quirkes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept men were marueilous well assured of the groundes of so great and so generall an innouation. For it is enacted, that <note n="2" place="margin">15. Ed. 3. c. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>great Officers about the King, and in his Courtes of Iustice, shall from time to time forwarde, bee sworne when they shall be put in Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, to keepe and mainteine the priuiledges and franchises of Holy Church, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Can it with any colour be intended, that the <hi>Common</hi> Lawe doth allow Courts <hi>ecclesiastical</hi> to hold <hi>plea</hi> in those sundry other causes, which we haue hitherto proued to be <hi>ecclesiasticall:</hi> and yet, that it wil not allow them any meanes or possibilitie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to hold such <hi>pleas?</hi> For if no <hi>Lay</hi> man might be <hi>cited</hi> to an <hi>ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall</hi> Court, and there ordered to take <hi>othe</hi> in any other cause then those two: then first the <hi>partie</hi> conuented (if by Lawe he needed not) would neuer answere to the <hi>Libel</hi> vpon his <hi>othe.</hi> Yet hath this bene a course continually practised, and by Lawe so appointed, not onely in <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> but also in all Courtes of the <hi>Ciuill</hi> Lawe both here and throughout the rest of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Againe, if no <hi>Lay</hi> witnesses may be called to testifie in any other matter; then should most men in those causes, be hereby either quite foreclosed of their right; and many grosse sinnes should passe wholly without reformation or punishment: or else
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19125:53"/>
all such matters must needes be prooued, onely by such wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses that be of least indifferencie; and therefore of least trueth and credite. For those men be alwayes most <hi>indifferent,</hi> which either be friendes, or at least be no euill-willers, to either partie. Nowe seeing euery deposition must needes tende to the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance or hinderance of the one partie or the other: can it be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed of him which loues both, and doth wish alike well vnto them, that he will willingly and <hi>gratis</hi> without any processe come and depose, and thereby doe one of his friendes a displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure? there resteth then, that onely such will offer themselues to testifie; who either be <hi>enemies</hi> vnto both, or <hi>friendes</hi> to one, and either <hi>enemies</hi> or <hi>strangres</hi> to the other (and howe can these be vpright &amp; <hi>indifferent</hi> witnesses?) or else such who be meere stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers vnto both sides. but it doth most rarely happen, that meere <hi>strangers</hi> vnto both, shalbe able to depose any thing to purpose: and more rare will it be, that such will offer willingly of them selues, to come in <hi>ad testificandum.</hi> Besides these and many such like absurdities, necessarily ensuing this opinion; if it be yet still stoode in, that the <hi>Common</hi> lawe permittes <hi>compulsion</hi> of lay men (whether parties or witnesses) to take othe in causes <hi>testamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> and <hi>matrimoniall,</hi> but denies it in all other cases: let vs consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, what may be imagined for a probable reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of such differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce in proceeding betwixt causes that belong to the conisance of the selfe same courte. For I haue read and often heard, that the <hi>Common</hi> lawe is grounded vpon good and sound reason. And it cannot be said in this case: <hi>quamuis durum sit, tamen ita lex scripta est.</hi> for that this is no statute, or written lawe; but onely the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported opinion of one man, whence all the rest haue since taken it. Was it then meant, to giue vnto subiects an ample meanes of comming by their <hi>rightes</hi> in these two causes: but to restraine or debarre them in al other, as namely for <hi>tithes</hi> and other rightes demaundable in <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> courtes? or was it the purpose of that lawe, to haue men stand conuicted of most grieuous crimes that be of <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> conisance (as happely of <hi>Heresie)</hi> being neither by them confessed, nor yet proued by sincere and <hi>vpright witnesses:</hi> but onely by such, as doe thrust them selues in to beare witnesse; whom not onely common speach, but also sundry <hi>sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes</hi> doe terme <hi>Accusers,</hi> and therefore doe hold at least for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19125:54"/>
and men not indifferent? May not many other <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> causes be of as great importance &amp; preiudice, as (perhaps) a <hi>will</hi> of goods vnder xl. s. or a trifling <hi>legacie,</hi> or a x. pound matter, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised with a <hi>woman in mariage?</hi> and if the law had bin so, could no man hit of it from the <hi>Conquest,</hi> vntill our fathers time, when <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> writ his <hi>nouanatura breuiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?</hi> was none of skil in <hi>Edw.</hi> the 1. time, to put it into the statute of <hi>circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>spectè agatis:</hi> or in <hi>Ed.</hi> the 2. times, to mention it in the statute of <hi>Articuli Cleri?</hi> did none reade it in the <hi>Register</hi> that vnderstoode it, before <hi>Fitzher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert?</hi> or was it not put downe there, but in some late copies, as is most likely? And after he had set it downe, would not the law in that behalfe haue bin vrged against sundry <hi>Bishops,</hi> that practised the contrary in <hi>K. Hen.</hi> the 8. time, &amp; continually since, if that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion had bin holden for good lawe? Touching this matter, the <hi>Treatisour</hi> saith thus in effect: that <hi>the not co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelling of witnesses to sweare &amp; to depose their knowledges, brings none other preiudice; but that the partie plaintife, faileth in his proofes thereby.</hi> Why? is that no small preiudice, for a man (which hath in deede a right) to haue the causes goe against him, through the wilfulnesse of witnesses, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> neither will come of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, nor may be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled by others, as this opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> importeth? Is not this to giue cause of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiting the wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g doer, &amp; of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demning him that hath the very right? and doth it not nourish or at least tolerate that sinne in the witnes, which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The <hi>Treatisour</hi> further saith: that it may be sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t for a <hi>court ecclesiastical,</hi> to haue no better meanes for bringing in of witnesses to testifie, then <hi>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall</hi> courts haue. Truely if they might be allowed the same; I thinke none of them would desire any better. For when a witnesse is vnwilling to depose, vnlesse he be vrged by <hi>processe:</hi> what is more vsuall in <hi>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall</hi> courts, then to haue a <hi>sub-poena</hi> to charge him to appeare, and to testifie, at such a time &amp; place? But because by this his say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19125:54"/>
(it seemeth) he entendeth, that the course of vrging <hi>witnesses</hi> to testifie (as is claimed, &amp; alwaies hath bin vsed by courts <hi>eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall)</hi> conteineth some <hi>repugnancie</hi> against the lawes of the Realme: therefore, for cleering of that point, I wil briefely shew, that it is not so much as a <hi>diuerse,</hi> and much lesse a <hi>contrary</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant</hi> order, vnto the lawes of this Realme.</p>
                     <p>First for practise; what is more frequent, then for <hi>Iustices of the peace</hi> to binde men by <hi>recognisance,</hi> to giue in euidenc at <hi>Sessions</hi> or <hi>Assises</hi> touching supposed offendours?</p>
                     <p>It would be ouer tedious to set downe the sundry cases repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the booke of <hi>Assiles</hi> to this effect: viz. that <hi>where a deede is pleaded &amp; denied; and processe against the witnesses is desired; that it shall go out to call them to testifie.</hi> It wilbe sufficient to referre you, to <note n="1" place="margin">Brooke titulo testmoignes.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>But the precedent of <hi>attachment</hi> framed vpon this writ, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth generally, without excepting so much as these two causes; euen as if a <hi>lay</hi> man (whether <hi>partie</hi> or <hi>witnesse)</hi> might not be vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to answere or testifie, or to take an oath except he lust, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cause <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> at all.

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, that which is here <hi>recognitiones facere per Sacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> is in the <hi>Register</hi> with the disiunctiue; <hi>viz. ad aliquas recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiones faciendas, vel Sacrament a praestanda.</hi> Thirdly, in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister</hi> these words are added; <hi>ad citationem talis episcopi.</hi> That writ which <hi>Rastall</hi> setteth down at large (whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cesoeuer he had it) seemeth to be the perfect &amp; whole copy of the originall, &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of more credit. It is also probable, that the gatherer of the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19125:57"/>
                        <hi>Register</hi> did abridge out of this Writ at large, as hee thought good. For in the very Writs that went foorth in deed (the copies whereof bee in the <hi>Register)</hi> letters (for the most part) bee put there, in stead of the names of the parties: whereas, here it is <hi>ad citationem talis episcopi, &amp; talem episcopum,</hi> without name or any letter for it; that might direct men to know, of what Writ it was a parcell; which argueth, it was not <hi>verbatim</hi> copied foorth of the Writ. Howsoeuer it be, the one of them must expound the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, seeing they concerne one and the selfe same matter.</p>
                     <p>In treating therefore hereof; I mind first to shew, that albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it these words did carie the sence y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is inforced; yet it may be, that the law is otherwise, then y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are not of that acceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: &amp; last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie how they are otherwise meant, &amp; what is that true meaning.</p>
                     <p>For the first, it is no lawe of necessitie; being neither <hi>Statute,</hi> nor <hi>Common</hi> lawe. No statute: for it is not in the <hi>Parliament rols,</hi> nor in any printed booke of statutes at large, nor in sundrie anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent written copies. It is no <hi>common</hi> law: for it is sayd to be <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mata prohibitio super articulis cleri</hi> (<note n="1" place="margin">9. Edw. 2.</note> which is a statute of late time in comparison) and the precedent of that <hi>Prohibition</hi> (as it is in the <hi>Register</hi> printed, &amp; being vnderstood according to the mind of the Authors of this opinion) is contrarie to the generall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Realme. For by time immemoriall, all <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> courts (without impeachment) haue cited both the parties prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall for answere; and witnesses also, vrging them to depose by oath, in all the other seuerall causes also, that are prooued afore to be of <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> iurisdiction and conusance.</p>
                     <p>I haue had of long time an olde <hi>Register</hi> in parchment writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten (as may be euidently gathered, and appeareth by the frame of the hand and letter) about king <hi>Edward</hi> the seconds, or king <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds time. In it there is no such precedent of <hi>prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or of <hi>Attachment;</hi> as either the printed <hi>Register,</hi> or <hi>Rastals Abridgement</hi> of statutes, setteth downe. But there are many <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions</hi> vnto <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> courts, that run in this sort, viz. <hi>Ne te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neatis placitum in curia christianitatis de catallis &amp; debitis, quae non sunt de testamento vel matrimonio.</hi> And the first of this sort is thus entituled in the margent: <hi>Prohibitio regia de catallis &amp; debitis quae non sunt de testamento vel matrimonto.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>One thing besides I find there (in mine opinion) worth the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19125:58"/>
for this purpose; yet not obserued in the printed <hi>Register.</hi> For such precedents of Originall Writs, as exceeded the memorie of any man, at what time they were first drawen &amp; framed: that old booke setteth downe simply without any addition. But if they were of later times deuised; then this marke &amp; title is giuen vnto them in the margent, viz. <hi>Prohibitio formata,</hi> or <hi>breue, &amp;c. formatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Now <hi>Rastals Abridgement</hi> giueth the like title to the writ (wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon this controuersie groweth) viz. <hi>Prohibitio formata super arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis cleri:</hi> which argueth that there is no such original writ of old at the common law; but that it was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> newly deuised to meete with a new mischiefe. <hi>Quae de nouo emergu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, nouo indigent auxilio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The being of it in the <hi>Register,</hi> doth not make it of necessitie to be law; for sundry of those writs were framed of late times (as may appeare to any that wil peruse the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> particular me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s suits (&amp; as occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s fel forth) &amp; somtimes (perhaps) drawn vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> priuate suggestio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the counsel of one side, though afterward allowed.</p>
                     <p>Nay in my said old written <hi>Register</hi> of writs, there is a precede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t which (as I take it) goeth not now for lawe. For there is a direct writ to the <hi>shirifs</hi> of <hi>London;</hi> signifiyng, that no <hi>Clerke</hi> (though he forfeit his recognizance of <hi>statute merchant)</hi> shalbe attached or imprisoned by his body: except there bee some cause why hee should not enioy the priuiledge of a <hi>Clerke.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Besides, it is no new or strange thing, to haue some forme of a writ which is set down in the <hi>Register,</hi> to be vpon better aduise disallowed. For I haue credibly heard, that it was not long since adiudged, that in an action for trespasse, done in a warren of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> might not plead that they were <hi>cuniculi sui;</hi> albeit the <hi>Register</hi> (in that behalfe) <note n="1" place="margin">Reg. fol 102. tit. de transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one.</note> frameth the writ so. And in the selfe same title (whence this forme of <hi>prohibition</hi> is taken) a clause in a <hi>prohibition</hi> was <note n="2" place="margin">Reg. fol. 37.</note> reiected by the court. For it is said in the marge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, <hi>Curia noluit concedere istam clausulam in prohibitione:</hi> but if it were law assured, the Iudges would not haue reiected it.</p>

                        <hi>of Nature of writs,</hi> was the first that sucked this conceit thence) in the selfe same booke touching this rule, set downe in the <hi>Register,</hi> viz. <hi>notandum est, quòd quando rex praesentat vt in iure coronae, tunc incurrit ei tempus:</hi> saieth thus; <hi>now this rule is not holden for lawe.</hi> But it will bee said, that <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbert</hi> himselfe, and sundry that follow him since, doe hold this point we speake of, for lawe. This (no doubt) carieth a great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19125:58"/>
with it, &amp; that worthily; for the worth of the learning &amp; iudgements of such men. Yet I wil shew that his saying (from whom they all since do take it) is none vndoubted rule of lawe; &amp; therefore theirs neither, that do gather from him. I protest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, I wil not seeke after obiections against his booke; but take only such two (in stead of mo) which I had in my mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they do touch <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> matters. He saieth, that <note n="1" place="margin">Fitzh. ibid. fol. 269. D.</note> 
                        <hi>at the Common law, an heretike ere he can be condemned, must be conuicted of heresie before the Archbishop, &amp; the whole Clergie of the prouince, &amp; after abiured thereupon; &amp; after that (of fresh) conuicted &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the clergie of that prouince: &amp; this must be in their general councel of conuocation:</hi> &amp; holdeth there; that <hi>at the Common law, a bishop in his dioecesse might not condemne an heretike, vntill 2.

                        <hi>did giue him authoritie: &amp; that then he might not be committed to the secular power to be burnt, vntil he had once abiured, &amp; was againe relapsed into that, or some other heresie.</hi> But neither of these points be law; &amp; so I haue heard the two <hi>chiefe Iustices,</hi> the <hi>L. chief Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi> &amp; some other Iudges, &amp; the Queens learned councel, resolue in a speciall consultation holden about the matter of heresie. For albeit the <hi>Conuocation</hi> may (in deed) condemn an heretike, yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery B. at the <hi>Common</hi> law (before any statute) might (&amp; at this day may also) in his own <hi>dioecesse</hi> so condemn; as the preamble of that very statute makes manifest: &amp; so by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all, was it then hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den for lawe, notwithstanding <hi>Fitzh.</hi> opinion there; which was fully by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> considered of. And albeit it may seeme needlesse, yet for further strengthening of these reuerend mens opinions, there is a <note n="3" place="margin">10. H. 7. fol. 17.</note> booke in the very point. For it is said, <hi>that for heresie or any point against the faith, the BB. had none other power to bring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in, but to make processe against them by citations, vntill the Statute of Heresie, 2. H. 4. ergo,</hi> afore that statute, they had power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed against <hi>heretikes,</hi> in <hi>Ordinarie</hi> course of the lawe <hi>ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</hi> Which assertion the very <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> also maketh in his title <hi>of the lawes of England,</hi> yet to another purpose: howsoeuer in the maine point y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we now treat of, he sticke fast to <hi>Fitzherbert.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Likewise, <note n="4" place="margin">Fitzh. no. na. br. fol. 30. F.</note> he saith <hi>it appeareth, that before the statute made</hi> pro clero <hi>in the 18. of king Edw. 3. cap. 7. the right of tithes were determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in the Temporall court of the king; and that the lawe was alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at that time herein, by that statute.</hi> Whereas (in very trueth)
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19125:59"/>
there appeareth no such matter; other then a grieuance offered (in this behalfe) to the libertie of the Church, which then was determined, that it should afterward cease.</p>
                     <p>I know that <hi>Gooddall</hi> (writing <hi>of the liberties of the Clergie, by the lawes of the Realme)</hi> concurreth in this point with <hi>Fitzher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert:</hi> for thus he writeth; <hi>It seemeth that before the Statute, the right of tithes were determinable in the Temporall courte: but that statute hath altered the law.</hi> So that it may be coniectured, the one of them borowed it of the other.</p>
                     <p>But this whole doubt, whether causes of <hi>tithes,</hi> before that statute of <hi>Edw. 3.</hi> were determinable in an ecclesiasticall court or no, is resolued by a <hi>Treatise</hi> nipping (in trueth) wholie at the <hi>Clergie</hi> and lawes ecclesiasticall, and so indifferent an Vmpier, as that the <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> alleageth him for his purposes: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this case not to be refused by them, who produce him for their witnesse. For that <note n="1" place="margin">Of the power of the Clergie, and lawes of the realme, cap. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>Treatise</hi> writeth thus, viz. <hi>Long after that the kings courts of his Bench &amp; commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Pleas, &amp; also all inferior courts were put out of iurisdiction for tithes: yet neuerthelesse Writs of Scire facias were commonly sued in the Chancerie for tithes, and the defendants were thereupon put to answere: wherefore at the peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the clergie, and in consideration of a disme that the clergie gra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the king, it was enacted 18. E. 3. ca. vlt. that such Writs of Scire facias, thenceforth should not be granted for tithes.</hi> And a litle afore <note n="2" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> thus, viz. <hi>That suites for tithes shalbe taken in the Spirituall court, is only grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded vpon a fauour, that the kings of this realme, &amp; the whole realme, haue in times past borne to the clergie.</hi> And <note n="3" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> againe in this sort: <hi>We thinke that the kings courts be put out of iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for tithes, by a custome of the realme, &amp; not by the immediate power of the lawe of God.</hi> Therfore (by this mans opinion) it is the common law or custome of the land; and not that statute, which made tithes of conisance ecclesiasticall.</p>
                     <p>And in very trueth that tithes were demandable in a court ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical before this; may appeare by statutes afore that time, &amp; by reports after; testifying that the conusance of right of tithes (at the Common law) is incident to iurisdiction ecclesiastical, as in the peculiar <note n="4" place="margin">Ca. 4, 5, &amp; 6. huius Partis.</note> treatise thereof, is afore shewed.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, (to shut vp this first point) a precedent of a <hi>prohibition</hi> of all other Writs that can be deuised, may with least reason bee
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19125:59"/>
said, necessarily to report what is lawe: for that <hi>Prohibitions</hi> are so often reuersed &amp; disanulled againe, by <hi>consultations:</hi> as might haue happened in this very-matter; for any thing that can be certainely knowen, as well as in any other such like.</p>
                     <p>For the second point, that <hi>Recognitionem facere,</hi> simply and absolutely, cannot signifie the answere vnto the Libel of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie conuented, nor the deposition of witnesses, may appeare: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this fourme of <hi>Prohibition,</hi> is said to be <hi>formata super Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis Cleri,</hi> But out of them no such matter can (with any colour) be gathered; &amp; therefore being taken in such sense, must needes be a glose besides his text.</p>
                     <p>Againe, I finde in the fourme of another writ in <hi>Fitzherbert,</hi> where <hi>Sacramento recognoscere,</hi> so being ioyned together, <note n="1" place="margin">Fitzh. nou. na. breu. fol. 31.</note> doth signifie a testification by oath. Likewise in sundry <note n="2" place="margin">Reg. in br. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic. fol. 7. a. 12. a. &amp; 75. a.</note> writs of the <hi>Register, recognitio per sacramentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> velrecognoscere per Sacramentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> is vsed for a deposition, vpon oath. But where <hi>Recognitionem fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi> (without further addition) should signifie a <hi>parties answere,</hi> or <hi>witnesses deposition,</hi> I doe not call to minde that I haue read in any, so much as pretending to write <hi>Latine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Howesoeuer it might be shewed in other, surely in that <hi>Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,</hi> which is in the <hi>Register</hi> (for auoiding many absurdities) it cannot so signifie. for the <hi>Register</hi> reades it, that the <hi>Sherife</hi> shall not permit laye men to come together in any place, <hi>ad recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones faciendas, vel Sacramenta praestanda,</hi> but in those two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. So that by the <hi>disiunctiue (Vel)</hi> whatsoeuer <hi>recognitionem fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere</hi> be there: neither that may be done, nor an <hi>oath</hi> in any other cause may be taken by any <hi>Lay</hi> man whatsoeuer, though other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise he were willing. For the word <hi>Laici</hi> is indefinite, not restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to any one sort of <hi>Lay</hi> men: and so that which is here forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, is simply forbiddento all <hi>Lay</hi> persons, and in al other causes, whether they be parties or witnesses, willing or vnwilling, with oathe or without oathe. For in the <hi>Prohibitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </hi> there, no mentio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is made of that clause, which the <hi>attachement thereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </hi> doth inserte, viz. <hi>ipsis inuitis.</hi> So that, if that precedent of <hi>Prohibition</hi> be of it self perfite: this which I haue said, doth thereupon necessarily follow. But if any thing be to be vnderstood, which is not expressed: then why may we not (for reco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciling of <hi>Rastels</hi> writ &amp; this together) safely affirme; that they be both to be vnderstood, of <hi>recognitions</hi>
                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:19125:60"/>
and <hi>oathes</hi> giuen (in deede) in <hi>eccles.</hi> courtes, but yet touching <hi>goodes</hi> &amp; <hi>chattels,</hi> no way concerning matter, either <hi>testamentarie,</hi> or <hi>matrimoniall.</hi> It ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be truely said, that <hi>recognoscere</hi> is <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praestare,</hi> or <hi>recognitio,</hi> to be the same that <hi>Sacramentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ipsu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> the oath it self. This is proued by the precede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of that very <hi>prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </hi> in the <hi>Register:</hi> where they are distinguished, as two seueral things, with a particle <hi>disiunctiue.</hi> And like wise by the writ, in <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stals Abridegeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</hi> for there the <hi>recognitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </hi> is forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be <hi>made, per Sacramentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> &amp; therfore not the same, but diuerse things: see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no matter is the selfe same thing with that; which is but his <hi>adiuncte.</hi> Then being not the same things, &amp; both forbidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and presupposing the interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is vrged: it wil follow that no <hi>Lay</hi> defendant neede, nay he may not <hi>recognise</hi> (though without oath) or make any answere at all, in any other cause <hi>eccles.</hi> then those two. So that there wil neuer be issue ioyned; and so no <hi>plea ecclesiasticall,</hi> sauing in those two causes. For will any defendant (thinke ye) make any answere at al, either whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a thing is demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him that he list not to yeeld vnto; or when he is cited to be punished; if neither he neede doe it, nor yet may by law, though he would? But admit the defendant would be willing, &amp; would aduenture the daunger of lawe, for answering to the plaintife, &amp; ioyning issue with him: yet how many such <hi>pleas</hi> could proceede any further; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no <hi>lay witnesses</hi> might be vsed, either with oath or without oathe, to <hi>make recognition,</hi> or to <hi>depose?</hi> And if <hi>Rastals</hi> writ be law, &amp; so to be vnderstood, as is nowe enforced: so that witnesses may not testifie in other causes then those two <hi>super sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramenta sua;</hi> their depositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (as of men vnsworne) must needes be meerely void, by al lawes diuine &amp; humane. So that if the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition</hi> be not meant of holding <hi>plea</hi> touching <hi>goodes or chattels</hi> in other causes, it must needes sort to this point; that in no cause (besides those two) any <hi>lay perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        </hi> may (by law) though he would, come to answere or testifie, with an oath or without an oath, in a court <hi>ecclesiastical.</hi> But this is absurd &amp; vnreasonable to imagine, and wilbe so confessed, euen by those who stand in this opinion: and therefore that must needes be also absurd, whereupon it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily followeth. For <hi>omne verum vero co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sentaneu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> and, by the rule of reason we knowe, <hi>Ex veris possunt nil nisi vera sequi.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nowe for proofe that it is absurd and contrary to lawe, thus I
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19125:60"/>
proceede: No plea can be holden, but where there is one that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth, and another which denieth that which is affirmed: and then either matter of recorde or witnesses must be vsed, to proue the intention of the plaintife: But in sundry other causes then those two, <hi>pleas</hi> (by law) may be holden in a court <hi>ecclesiasticall;</hi> (as I hope) manifoldely and sufficiently, is afore shewed in this <hi>Treatise:</hi> and therefore in those other causes, <hi>Lay</hi> men may, and ought to <hi>answere</hi> and <hi>testifie:</hi> which is the contradictorie of that, which doeth necessarily followe, vpon this their interpretation. So that this conclusion being true, the contradictory of it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true; and then that vntrue also, whereupon it is necessarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent. For (as I said afore) I trust no reasonable man will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that onely <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> men will prooue deteiners of such <hi>ecclesiastical</hi> dueties, and culpable in those offences, that are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued (afore) to be of <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> conusance: nor yet that they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shal alwayes happen to be present, and able to beare witnesse, in all those other seuerall <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> causes, afore touched.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore to make it more plaine, and to deliuer it in seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty; <hi>recognitionem facere</hi> cannot signifie (in this place) the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere of the party conuented. For if a lay man against who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is cause of action, vpon some other of the matters <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> list not, nay if he neede not, and which is more, if (by law) he may neither come to the place, nor (being come) may answere either yea or no; then could no <hi>plea</hi> at all in any such <hi>ecclesiastical</hi> cause be holden. If it be said, that a <hi>Lay</hi> man must answere, but not by oath in such other cause: I replie againe, that either the <hi>Register</hi> hath not the writ aright printed, or else this no way can be so meant. For by the <hi>disiunctiue (vel)</hi> when the proposition is nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and prohibitiue, as it is here, both the one and the other is forbidden to be done. <note n="1" place="margin">Arg. l. 13. cùm ita ff. de rebus dubiis.</note> A <hi>disiunctiue</hi> argueth seueral things, that had neede to be expressed by seuerall wordes.</p>
                     <p>And by like reason it cannot be meant of <hi>witnesses</hi> depositions: for if the partie conuented shall be content <hi>de facto,</hi> (though he be not compellable by lawe, as this opinion presupposeth) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the intention of his aduersarie; then no <hi>Lay</hi> witnesse might in any such other cause <hi>ecclesiasticall,</hi> be vsed, either to depose with oathe or without oathe; because both be forbidden, and so no plea in any such other <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> cause coulde be holden,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19125:61"/>
which is afore prooued to be otherwise: and therefore conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that is not the meaning of these wordes of the writte, which is (by <note n="1" place="margin">Fitzh. nou. na. breu. fol. 41. a.</note> 
                        <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> and others that follow him) enforced.</p>
                     <p>Touching the writ of <hi>Attachement</hi> thereupon whether (as it is set out in the <hi>Register)</hi> it may be holden to haue bin an <hi>originall writ</hi> at the <hi>Common</hi> law, drawen (at first) by the grauest aduise in the Realme; &amp; to be so perfite, as that nothing (further then is expressed by the words) neede therein to be vnderstood to come by the true meaning: may partly be gathered by that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. First it is said, <hi>pone talem episcopu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> not vsing letters for his name, as in most of the other writs. Next, a <hi>Bishop</hi> (who in that he hath a <hi>Barony,</hi> is presumed to haue temporalties whereon to be distreined) is here appointed to finde <hi>vadios &amp; plegios.</hi> Thirdly, it hath <hi>laicos homines &amp; foeminas;</hi> as if women were not <hi>homines;</hi> seeing <hi>homo</hi> is the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon gender. Fourthly, though the <hi>prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is framed) forbiddeth both <hi>recognitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s to be made, and oathes also to be taken by lay men:</hi> yet the <hi>Attachement</hi> wholly omitteth the <hi>making of recognitions.</hi> And yet howe many <hi>oathes</hi> soeuer should be giuen if none <hi>answeres or depositions</hi> doe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon euer followe (which two the opinion that we impugne, meaneth by <hi>recognition)</hi> what colour of preiudice doeth or can growe, that either <hi>Prohibition</hi> or <hi>Attachement,</hi> should neede to be awarded? Fiftly, neither by <hi>Ciuill</hi> nor <hi>Canon</hi> lawe; neither yet by practice; doth any sommons or citation goe out of an <hi>ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall</hi> court, in such sort, as this <hi>Attachement</hi> assigneth, to be a preiudice vnto the royall dignitie, viz. <hi>ad comparendum coram eo, ad praestandum iuramentum, pro voluntate sua; ipsis inuitis.</hi> For it were a grieuance giuen (euen at the <hi>Canon</hi> lawe) if an <hi>Ordinarie</hi> should either call any being not a partie or necessarie witnesse in some matter depending, or should call witnesses against their will, not being first required, and hauing their charges offered; or if he should do it, when there is no cause, but <note n="2" place="margin">Pro voluntate sua.</note> 
                        <hi>for his owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> as this writ implieth. Sixtly, the proceeding hereby condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, is saide to be done; <hi>in praeiudicium graue, coronae &amp; dignitatis nostrae regiae.</hi> But if no matters be thereby drawen from the kings courtes, as in deede none be (though you followe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof by some enforced) then what preiudice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to the crowne? For, though lay men be vrged to depose
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19125:61"/>
vpon their <hi>othes,</hi> in all other causes besides, that be of <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> conisance; what damage or detriment doth the <hi>Crowne</hi> and <hi>dignitie royall</hi> thereby susteine; more then it doth by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsiue deposing with <hi>othe,</hi> in causes <hi>Testamentarie</hi> and <hi>Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall,</hi> which this opinion admitteth and alloweth of? For if none other causes <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> then those two, could conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently be proceeded in, nor any remedy could be giuen by a court <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> for want either of the <hi>parties answere,</hi> or <hi>witnesses de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions</hi> vpon <hi>othe:</hi> yet could not <hi>Temporall</hi> Courts (as the Lawe standeth) giue any more remedy in them. And so no preiudice to them or to the <hi>Crowne,</hi> that Courtes <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> do proceed as they do, to the determination of such causes. Nay rather on the other side it were a preiudice to the <hi>Crowne,</hi> that subiects should offend, and no good meanes should be found by Law to punish them; or to haue a right, &amp; yet no way for them to come by it.</p>
                     <p>Seuenthly, that which is there condemned, is said to be <note n="1" place="margin">Consuetudine praed. vsi fueri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus semper li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettatibus huius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modi.

                     <p>And againe; in Courts <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> the custome hath alwayes bene, to require <hi>othes</hi> of <hi>parties</hi> and <hi>witnesses</hi> (though otherwise vnwilling) in maner as is a fore touched. Which may appeare, both in that the Lawes <hi>Ciuill</hi> and also <hi>Canon,</hi> which they deale by, doe require it: and that no bookes of <hi>Actes Ecclesiasticall</hi> (as I am verely perswaded) can be shewed, whether of olde or later times; by which it may not appeare, that this course of compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling <hi>parties</hi> and <hi>witnesses</hi> to take <hi>othes,</hi> in other causes then those two; hath bene vsed, so often as occasion hath required. And therefore not this, but some other maner of proceeding it was; which by the Writte of <hi>Attachment</hi> is meant, to be <hi>contra con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetudinem regni.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly, this fourme of <hi>Attachment,</hi> mentioneth not so much, as excepting of compelling to take <hi>othe,</hi> in causes <hi>Testamentarie</hi>
                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:19125:62"/>
and <hi>Matrimoniall;</hi> albeit the <hi>prohibition</hi> haue that exception. And therefore for auoyding of iarre betwixt them, something must necessarily be vnderstood, to haue bene at first in the Writ it selfe (whereof this is a minute) further then is here expressed. And why shall not then, the clause <hi>de catallis &amp; debitis</hi> be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood therein, aswell as this other; seeing so strong probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties doe leade it, and so many absurdities and inconueniences be thereby auoyded; which the late enforced interpretation doth (necessarily) inferre with it selfe?</p>
                     <p>Therefore wee may conclude this second point: that to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barre Courtes <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> in any cause of that <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> from exacting <hi>parties</hi> conuented to put in their <hi>answeres</hi> vpon their <hi>othes,</hi> or from compelling such <hi>witnesses</hi> (by censures) to testifie, who being required, and their necessary charges being offered, doe neuerthelesse refuse to testifie a trueth: is not, nor yet can be, the meaning of that <hi>Prohibition,</hi> or of the <hi>Attachment</hi> thereupon.</p>
                     <p>The last point of the three to be touched, is concerning the true meaning of those wordes of the Writte, whence these con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies haue flowed. It is therefore to be remembred, that it was very vsuall for men in those dayes, at making of any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts, whether in matters of <hi>Lay fee</hi> or others, for their more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie, to <hi>make faith</hi> or <hi>othe,</hi> for performance. This they either did priuately, for confirming of deedes drawen betwixt them: or else (for more readinesse of dispatch and better testimonie) they <note n="1" place="margin">Register. pag. 37.</note> would recognize one to another such contractes, with faithful promise (called <hi>
                           <unclear>fidei</unclear> praestatio)</hi> and sometimes with <note n="2" place="margin">Register. pag. 43. monstrauit nobis Matilda.</note> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall <hi>othes</hi> voluntarily taken before <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> and therefore procure an Acte to be made by a <hi>publicke Notary.</hi> Then, if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>paertie</hi> failed in performance, he was by <hi>Processe Ecclesiastical</hi> called before the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> as to answere for an Acte done afore him, or <hi>fidei laesione:</hi> which failing, being confessed or proued, the <hi>Offendour</hi> was enioyned grieuous penance, and (no doubt) oftentimes compelled by <hi>censures,</hi> to keepe his <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>othe,</hi> by satisfying of the other <hi>partie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This course being so ready at their owne doores in euery <hi>Dioe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> and of so speedy execution; for the great feare then caried (by most sorts of men) vnto the <hi>censures Ecclesiasticall,</hi> and for grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uousnes
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19125:62"/>
of the penance otherwise; grew to be very vsuall in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry place; as may partly appeare by the often disputes vpon <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions</hi> brought hereupon (euen after this Writte was framed) that are here and there mentioned in the bookes of the <hi>Common</hi> Law, and are afore touched by me in <note n="1" place="margin">c. 8. huius part.</note> the 8. Chapter: and partly may be shewed by sundry old euidences and <hi>instruments,</hi> recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in ancient <hi>legers,</hi> and in <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> Courts, before the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the second, which I haue seene and perused. Namely I haue ready to be shewed, a solemne contract in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting made almost 400. yeres agone: wherein the <hi>Earle</hi> of <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> vpon a concord then made for himselfe and his heires, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth and graunteth to the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and to his successors, certaine red deere and fallow of both seasons, yeerely for euer, to be at a certaine place deliuered for the <hi>Archbishop,</hi> out of the forest of <hi>Arundel.</hi> For the obseruation whereof, he there bindeth himselfe and his heires, by a corporall <hi>othe</hi> taken; and further graunteth, that if he or they faile herein, then the <hi>Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop</hi> shall excommunicate them so failing, and keepe them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same <hi>censure,</hi> till the purport of that agreement be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed.</p>
                     <p>I haue likewise to be shewed, an olde written booke of <note n="2" place="margin">23. Ed. primi.</note> 
                        <hi>Acts Ecclesiasticall,</hi> sped in the <hi>Audience</hi> Court of the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in the reigne of King <hi>Edward</hi> the first, wherein sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry suites <hi>pro laesione fidei</hi> of that nature be conteined. The thing which gaue colour hereunto, was the pretence of auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and punishing the sinne of <hi>Periurie.</hi> For the <hi>Canon</hi> Lawe saith thus: <hi>Iuramenti causa, regulariter quis forum Ecclesiasticum, &amp; non seculare sortitur.</hi> c. praedicandum. 22. q. &amp; D D. in c. cum sit ex. de foro competenti.</p>
                     <p>

So that the mischiefe that grew hereupon was this: that most <hi>Lay</hi> contracts <hi>of goods and chattels</hi> were by this meanes drawen into <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> Courts, though (in trueth as I thinke) contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the <hi>Common</hi> Lawe of the Realme. For if the <hi>principall</hi> mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be of <hi>Lay</hi> conusance, for confirmation whereof such <hi>faith</hi> is made, or <hi>othe</hi> taken; then (according to the distinction <note n="1" place="margin">Cap. huius partis 8.</note> afore prooued out of the <hi>Common</hi> Law) it is not such <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>othe,</hi> that will change the authoritie of the Court, to make it simply of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Iurisdiction.</hi> For so <note n="2" place="margin">Bracton. lib. 5. cap. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>Bracton</hi> writing in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the 3. testifieth, and withall giueth good light and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to the interpretation hereafter following, of those words of this Writ: <hi>Iurisdictionem regiam non mutat fidei interpositio, sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentum praestitum, nec spontanea partium renuntiatio, quamuis sibijpsis in hac parte praeiudicent per consensum: &amp; illud idem dicen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum erit de debitis &amp; catallis, quae non sunt de Testamento vel Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonio, vel eorum sequela.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It was <note n="3" place="margin">Grauam. 64.</note> one of the <hi>hundred Grieuances</hi> which the <hi>Germaine</hi> na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion complained of: <hi>that Ciuill causes and contracts, by pretence of faith or othe giuen, were drawen into Ecclesiasticall conisance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore to meete with this mischiefe, and to cut off the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, this Writte of <hi>Prohibition</hi> seemeth to haue bene framed, <hi>viz.</hi> to forbid <hi>Lay</hi> men in any place, either before <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> or in priuate amongs themselues, to make any <hi>recognitions</hi> or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgings: whereof? <hi>of debts, or of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tracts touching goods and chattels</hi> by their <hi>faiths</hi> or <hi>othes</hi> taken, in any cause whatsoeuer, besides <hi>Testamentary</hi> or <hi>Matrimoniall.</hi> For in these two causes neither then, nor at any time since (as in part is afore shewed) was it vnlawfull, for <hi>Lay</hi> men to make acknowledgement and depose in a Court <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> vpon <hi>othe,</hi> though it touched goods and chattels. In matters <hi>Testamentary,</hi> as in <hi>Probats,</hi> and in <hi>legacies</hi> of goods and chattels in demaund; in matter of <hi>inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries,</hi> and of <hi>accounts</hi> of the deads goods and chattels.

                        <hi>matrimoniall,</hi> as in <hi>money promised with a woman in mariage,</hi> as is more fully shewed in the 3. Chapter. And so this <hi>writ</hi> is not simply prohibitorie of all <hi>Recognitions and Oathes</hi> (by lay men) in <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> Courtes, excepting those two causes: but onely forbiddeth <hi>Recognitions and oathes</hi> in other causes made or taken, that doe touch <hi>debtes, goods</hi> and <hi>chattels, or other such lay contracts,</hi> and all <hi>citing</hi> of <hi>parties</hi> to take them, or which haue taken them, and all <hi>citing</hi> or compelling of <hi>witnesses</hi> to depose touching such contracts about <hi>goods</hi> and <hi>chattels:</hi> though confirmed by <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>othe</hi> of the contractours.</p>
                     <p>Nay there is strong euidence to be brought; that not many scores of yeeres, before the 9. of <hi>Edward</hi> the 2. (when as <hi>Articuli Cleri</hi> were enacted, whereupon that <hi>Prohibition</hi> is said to be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) the <hi>Clergie</hi> both vsed, and thought they shoulde haue wrong to be barred from hearing all breaches of <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie</hi> arising of, or touching what cause soeuer: so they dealt not with the very <hi>Temporal</hi> causes themselues whereupon such <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>othe</hi> was confirmatorie. <hi>If</hi> (saith a <hi>Constitution</hi> 
                        <note n="1" place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stit. aeternae sanctio. de poenis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Concilio apud Lambhith sub Bonifacio Anno 1260. tempore Henrici 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Prouinciall</hi> of <hi>Canterbury) perhaps our Lord the King in his Attachments, prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, summons, shall make mention not of tithes, but of right of Patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage: not of breach of faith or periurie, but of chattels: not of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, or disturbance of liberties Ecclesiasticall, but of trespasses of his subiects, the correction of which, he affirmeth doth belong to him: then let the aforesaid Prelats make known vnto him, that they neither take conisance, nor minde to doe, touching Patronage, chattels, or other things belonging to his Courts: but of tithes, sinnes, and other causes meere Spiritual, belonging to their Office and Iurisdiction.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we first gather, that the <hi>Common</hi> Law herein was not then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely agreed vpon; in that they conceiued, this allegation tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching <hi>faith broken</hi> and <hi>periury,</hi> would satisfie the <hi>King</hi> and his <hi>Courts.</hi> And secondly that the <hi>Kings Writs of prohibition</hi> and <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachement</hi> (in this behalfe) were then awarded, but for <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>othes</hi> made, concerning <hi>goods and chattels,</hi> because by that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, the conisance of <hi>chattels</hi> was drawen into <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> Courtes.</p>
                     <p>I do finde in an old written parchment booke of statutes, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching downe but to H. 5. death; many matters of marke contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned amongs the statutes. As among others there be, <hi>regiae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suetudines
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:19125:64"/>
 apud Claringdon promulgatae.</hi> which (as is there rehear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed) were by <hi>K. Henry</hi> the second, propounded in <hi>Parliament</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> then <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Canterbury</hi> long before that <hi>Prouinciall constitution.</hi> Most of which, he did condemne by his <hi>censure,</hi> as preiudiciall to the liberties of the Church: And this is said there, to haue bene the originall cause, first of his banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and afte<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> of his death. But some of those customes, <hi>Becket</hi> did tolerate; whereof this is one, seruing to our present purpose, viz. <hi>Placita de debitis, quae fide interposita debentur, vel absque inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positione fidei, sint in curia regis. Hoc tolerauit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>At the ende of that <hi>Treatise</hi> it is saide; that <hi>foure yeeres after Beckets death, viz. 1174 of Christ; the King repenting himselfe, did together with the Prelates and greatmen of his kingdome, abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate and condemne those euill and vniust customes; appointing onely those that were good, to be thencefoorth obserued. Yet</hi> (saith he) <hi>some of those that were so abrogated by the king, and condemned by the Church; are still obserued in the kingdome. If this be with the kings knowledge and allowance, let the King looke to it, for God know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The chiefe cause why I note it, is this: that it was euen then thought a <hi>Custome</hi> of the <hi>Realme;</hi> and by <hi>Becket</hi> himselfe allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and tolerable; that <hi>Pleas of debts, though faith or othe were giuen for their payment, belonged to the Kings temporall Courtes.</hi> Next is, that hence may be gathered, how the <hi>Recognitions</hi> and <hi>othes</hi> forbidden to be made in Courts <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> by the Writs which we here dispute of; are to be vnderstood of such of them onely, as concerne <hi>debts or chattels;</hi> sauing that <hi>in causes Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary and Matrimoniall</hi> onely, they may be there made and acknowledged, albeit they concerne <hi>debts and chattels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It may also appeare euidently, that the <hi>Recognitions</hi> forbidden to be made in Courts <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> in any cause sauing of <hi>Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> or <hi>Matrimony,</hi> ought to be vnderstoode of <hi>Recognitions</hi> and <hi>othes</hi> about <hi>debts</hi> and <hi>chattels.</hi> For lightly in euery place, where these two matters of <hi>Testament</hi> and <hi>matrimony</hi> are spoken of, there also <hi>debts</hi> and <hi>chattels</hi> are spoken of to this effect; that in these two cases, <hi>Pleas</hi> of <hi>debts</hi> and <hi>chattels</hi> may be handled in Courts <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> but in none other. <hi>Bracton</hi> (who wrote before this Writte was framed) saith <note n="1" place="margin">Bracton lib. 5. cap. 2.</note> thus: <hi>Si Clericus petat

                     <p>I finde a <hi>Consultation</hi> in the <note n="6" place="margin">Regist. in Br. orig. fol. 54. a.</note> 
                        <hi>Register,</hi> where is rehearsed: that certaine <hi>Lay</hi> men of <hi>Couentree</hi> were by <hi>compulsories,</hi> called into an <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> Court, as <hi>necessary witnesses</hi> (in trueth) in a cause of <hi>legacie;</hi> yet they to auoyde apparance, and to obteine a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition;</hi> suggested that they were drawen into the Court <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian</hi> to testifie, about <hi>chattels and debts, not belonging to testament or Matrimony.</hi> Now if that meaning (of the Writ in controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie) which we here impugne, were true; what needed they to haue mentioned <hi>chattels and debts</hi> at all? for then, the other part of their suggestion (though false) had bene (in Lawe) sufficient, to haue obteined the <hi>prohibition,</hi> viz. That they were called, <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their wils,</hi> to testifie in a <hi>Court Ecclesiasticall,</hi> touching mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, being neither <hi>Testamentary</hi> nor <hi>Matrimoniall.</hi> But seeing they were driuen to pleade both: it argueth, that <hi>citing</hi> men to take <hi>othes,</hi> and to depose against their wills, in any other cause then those two; is not simply and absolutely prohibited; but for that the matter concerneth <hi>chattels and debts,</hi> and yet is neither <hi>Testamentary</hi> nor <hi>Matrimonial.</hi> And therefore not that (which of late is enforced) but this meaning of the Writ by me deliuered, is the true interpretation thereof.</p>
                     <p>The very Writte it selfe set downe by <note n="7" place="margin">Abridgement of the statutes. Prohibition. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Rastall</hi> at large, doth establish this interpretation: <hi>Rex Episcopo Norwicensi &amp;c. salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. Cùm cognitiones placitorum, &amp;c. super turatis Recognitionibus Laicum feodum contingentibus, &amp; rebus alijs ac causis pecuniarum,

&amp; alijs catallis &amp; debitis (quae non de testamento vel matrimonio) ad coronam &amp; dignitatem nostram pertineant &amp;c.</hi> for, if <hi>Iurata recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitio</hi> (being in the same writ) should signifie a diuerse thing: then must we needes say, that the recital speakes of a matter to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied, and yet the remedie giuen is of another nature, and so not pursuant to the former.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, the tenour of that writ runneth to the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Norwich,</hi> and to his <hi>Archdeacons, &amp;c.</hi> yet those wordes thereof, (whereupon the doubt riseth) are not directed to <hi>them,</hi> as if <hi>they</hi> should be charged thereby (which had bin most apt, if any such thing had bin meant) not so to <hi>cite lay men,</hi> or that <hi>they</hi> should not charge them with such <hi>oathes,</hi> or that <hi>they</hi> should not suffer such <hi>Recognitions</hi> to be made afore <hi>them:</hi> but it is there saide, that the <hi>King</hi> had commaunded the <hi>Sherife,</hi> that <hi>he</hi> should not permit, <hi>quod laici conueniant in aliquibus locis ad faciendas recognitiones, &amp;c.</hi> which vse of the wordes <hi>ne laici conueniant,</hi> and the changing of the persons, argue strongly that it was meant of such <hi>recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of debts and chattels,</hi> and such <hi>oathes,</hi> as <hi>Lay</hi> men of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues were willing ynough to make; and therefore had neede of such restraint, by the <hi>Sherifes</hi> authoritie. which their volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie perfourming thereof, without vrging by censures; is also ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued by that which is there said of the <hi>Ordinaries</hi> accepting at <hi>Lay</hi> mens hands of such things: viz. <hi>vobis praemissa, &amp; alia consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milia, in partibus illis, acceptantibus.</hi> This of their willingnesse without constraint, is also prooued by the wordes immediatly following the point in controuersie, viz. <hi>&amp; ne super huiusmodi feo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, debitis &amp; catallis, coram vobis &amp; alijs iudicibus Ecclesiasticis, in praeiudicium iurisdictionis nostrae regiae ad coronam &amp; dignitatem nostram spectantibus, subire praesumant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereby (as in a thing needefull) <hi>Lay men</hi> are charged not to dare or presume in any <hi>other</hi> causes before <hi>Ordinaries</hi> to make any such <hi>Recognition or oathe,</hi> touching <hi>goods</hi> or <hi>chattels,</hi> preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to the <hi>Crowne:</hi> by which wordes, this our interpretation is expressely established.

in <hi>Rastall,</hi> nor with the interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is by some of late vrged.

For whether we say, that <hi>Ordinaries</hi> then vsed to <hi>cite</hi> all in generall of their <hi>Dioecesse,</hi> who had made promises or contractes in lay causes, by worde onely, (or by writing) to come and confirme them, by their <hi>faith</hi> giuen, or by their <hi>corporall oathes</hi> before them, for better confirmation and securitie of the bargaine, as some wise and learned haue thought very <note n="1" place="margin">Pro huiusmodi rebus (per vices) trahitis coram vobis.

But this cannot be truely said, touching matters of meere <hi>ecclesiastical</hi> conisance, being neither <hi>testamentarie,</hi> nor <hi>matrimoniall;</hi> though <hi>lay</hi> men be vrged by courtes <hi>eccles.</hi> to answere or <hi>testifie</hi> in them vpon their <hi>oathes.</hi>

                     <p>Besides, what damage co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the cause nowe by vs defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; if we say, that the absurdities following vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being not a fore wel weyed, &amp; he out of whose copy the <hi>Register</hi> was printed, vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding it as they doe; was content to adde those two clauses, for an explanatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the said writs, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his owne meaning; or that he was willing they should so be vnderstood? which perhaps enduced him to make such a briefe abridgement, of so long a writ. For it doeth not appeare, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the imprinting, it was perused &amp; allowed by any the <hi>Iudges</hi> then being; or by any others, deputed by publike authoritie, for the reuiewing and correcting of it. No doubt if it had bin (that I speake of nothing else) so many grosse errors in the Latin both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gruity &amp; al sense, as in every leafe (almost) of the copie which the Printer followed, are to be found; could not haue so escaped, without co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trolement and amendment. But the former
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19125:66"/>
wordes set downe by <hi>Rastall</hi> at large in the writ in selfe (where neither of these last recited clauses are to be found) are too cleare in this point, to be dimmed by any such light colours. But if here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it be perhaps grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted (as the authour of the <hi>Treatise</hi> doth) that <hi>witnesses</hi> may take <hi>oath</hi> &amp; depose willingly, in other <hi>ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall</hi> causes, at the request of some of the parties: I must then call to their minde, that I haue shewed afore, that (following their owne interpretation) they may not, though they be willing. Yea though witnesses might, if they were willing; how can a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man entend, that the <hi>partie</hi> to be sued, will come in at all, but much lesse answere, if he may not be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pelled vnto neither: viz. <hi>ne<expan>

                     <p>Againe, by that their interpretation of <hi>recognition</hi> &amp; <hi>oath,</hi> they could neuer haue such witnesses that be indifferent, as in part is afore touched. For if witnesses may not be vrged to sweare or to answere further then they list themselues; then will they onely answere to the matters propounded by him who produceth them, and wil refuse to answere the <hi>Interrogatories</hi> propunded by the other <hi>partie</hi> for his defence, by whom they were not reque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted to come. Which course (vpon the matter) taking away all testimonie, that ought to be indifferent for either <hi>partie,</hi> in such pertinent matters as are to be demaunded; is contrary to the lawe of <hi>God,</hi> of <hi>nature,</hi> of <hi>nations,</hi> and to the very qualitie of a <hi>witnesse. Decius</hi> saith: <note n="1" place="margin">Decius in l. 2. C. de edendo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu. 43.</note> 
                        <hi>Si testis deposuit pro vna parte, &amp; interrogatus pro alia noluerit respo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dere, illi fides adhiberi non debet; quia praesumitur sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>primere veritatem.</hi> And so the course being most vnreasonable, that whereupon it followeth, must needes be also very absurde, and against Iustice. By all which premised discourse, it is made (I hope) manifest, whether <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> had good ground out of that fourme of <hi>Prohibition</hi> and <hi>Attachement</hi> to <note n="2" place="margin">Nou. nat. breu. fol. 41. litera a.</note> gather; not onely <hi>that Ordinaries must expresse a particular cause in all their Citations:</hi> but also, that <hi>if they expresse any cause at all in the Citation, that (it seemeth by that writte) it must bee a cause ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniall or testamentarie.</hi> For seeing they haue none other meanes besides <hi>Citations</hi> to summon men to their Courtes:
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19125:67"/>
What is this latter collection (built but vpon a doubtfull see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming) else then an asseueration implied; that none other of the causes (afore) proued to be of <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> conisance; shall euer be dealt in, by any court <hi>ecclesiasticall?</hi> and so (vpon the matter) in no court at all; for that <hi>temporall</hi> courts be out of <hi>iurisdiction</hi> in those matters. Which howe it may be defended from grosse ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surditie, I would gladly learne from any, that patroniseth this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. But if the lawe were so in deede, that none should be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> courts, but for those two causes: I marueile what the <hi>Preshyteries</hi> (so much doted after especially by sundry fauourers of this interpretation) would doe here in this Realme, when their <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sistorial</hi> power should be so lopped, that they could not call any man before them, but either in <hi>testamentarie</hi> causes (which they make in other mens dealings to be meere <hi>Ciuil</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses) or <hi>matrimoniall,</hi> many of which also they now seeme willing to abando<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as <hi>temporall</hi> matters? for they should be driuen, either to be kings of molehils; or else to preache in the most vehement veine they haue, against that lawe and those magistrates, which (in such sort) would restraine them: as if they were both <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian,</hi> at least for hindering and so impounding of the preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded gouernement of <hi>Christ:</hi> that thereby they might at length be set at libertie, to deale in their <hi>Consistories</hi> against all <hi>crimes</hi> whatsoeuer, according to their owne platfourmes. Yet herein they should deale very vnequally; because they will not nowe suffer that, vnder this gouernment; which themselues would pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice against <hi>crimes</hi> in a farre more ample, and peremptory ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, then either nowe is done, or were meete to be suffered.</p>
                     <p>In the bookes of the <hi>Common</hi> lawe I finde also some cases, that giue strength to this interpretation. For <hi>an</hi>

                        <hi>a Prohibition was sued foorth of the Chauncery (dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to the Iustices of the common Pleas) to make an Attachement, because the defendant had sued the plaintiffe in the spiritual court for debt, which did not touch matter of matrimonie nor testament, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the conisance belongs to the Kings Court: and thereupon a prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition

Ecclesiasticall:</hi> and <hi>whether nothing may at this day be adiudged he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, but according to the statute</hi> primo <hi>of her Maiesties</hi>

                        <hi>reigne:</hi> For in the true vnderstanding of that statute, the decision of these two opinions will wholie rest. It seemeth by the latter, the author of them thinketh, that before the statute, 2. H. 4. Ordinaries at the Common law might not by their iurisdiction Ecclesiastical, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the condemnation of an heretike: and therefore (seeing all former statutes made against heretikes, stand now repealed) he gathereth; that no heretike may be delt with, but according to the said statute, made in the first yeere of <hi>her Maiesties</hi> reigne.</p>
                     <p>This opinion (it may be) he gathered out <note n="2" place="margin">Fitzh. in noua nat. br. fol. 269. D</note> of <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> his <hi>Noua natura breuium:</hi> yet I thinke rather, it was his owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, both because he doeth not alleage <hi>Fitzherbert</hi> for it; and for that <hi>Fitzh.</hi> leaueth (euen at the <hi>Common</hi> lawe) authoritie in the whole Conuocation of a <hi>Prouince,</hi> to condemne an heretike, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he there also hold, that (at the <hi>Common</hi> lawe before such sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute) a <hi>Bishop</hi> in his dioecesse, could not so condemne. But I haue shewed in the twelfth chapter hereof, by very great and good opinion, the law in this point to be mistaken. For proofe that it is so, I also touched it something in the 8. chapter.</p>
                     <p>For in the <hi>Preamble</hi> of the statute it is thus conteined: <hi>The</hi> 
                        <note n="3" place="margin">2. H. 4. cap. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>dioecessans of the realme then complained, that they could not by their iurisdiction spirituall (without aide of the roiall Maiestie)</hi> what? not at all? Nay, but not <hi>sufficiently correct, nor restraine the malice of heretikes:</hi> Why? because they wanted authoritie at all to deale with them? No, but <hi>because the heretikes goe from dioecesse to dioe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, and will not appeare before the dioecessans, but contemne the keies of the Church, and censures of the same.</hi> So that, had it not bene for their <hi>fugitiuenesse,</hi> their <hi>refusing</hi> to appeare, and <hi>contempt</hi> of the keies; the <hi>ordinarie dioecessans</hi> had <hi>Iurisdiction spiritual,</hi> to correct and restraine them. In which respect, and for better assistance of their former iurisdiction, it was then first prouided, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tikes should be attached and imprisoned. Other authorities out of Statutes, I there (in the eight Chapter) alleaged also to this purpose.</p>
                     <p>The wordes of the Statute made <hi>primo</hi> of her <note n="4" place="margin">1. Eliz. cap. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Maiestie</hi> (from which this second opinion is gathered) doe make the matter cleere; that nothing thereby is meant, but that <hi>Commissioners for

causes ecclesiasticall,</hi> according to that Act (termed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people the <hi>high Commission) shal not haue authoritie to adiudge any matter or cause to be heresie, but onely such, as hath bene so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudged, by the authoritie of the Canonicall Scriptures, or by the first foure generall Councels, or by any other generall Councell; wherein the same was declared Heresie, by the expresse and playne wordes of the Canonicall Scriptures.</hi> So that the iurisdiction of <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> and of the <hi>Conuocation,</hi> still remaineth as it did afore at the <hi>Common</hi> lawe.</p>
                     <p>But I muse greatly what colour or pretence he could haue, to gather the first of these two opinions out of the aforesayd words: for doeth he or can he thinke, that the ordering, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining or adiudging of a matter to be <hi>Heresie</hi> by the <hi>Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ecclesiasticall</hi> (there spoken of) is a iudgement at, or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the course of the <hi>Common</hi> lawe, as the <hi>Common</hi> law is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in vsuall signification? Or shall it be imagined, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer any matter by occasion comes in to bee mentioned in a statute (as for <note n="1" place="margin">13.

In the <hi>Preamble</hi> 
                        <note n="1" place="margin">25. H. 8. ca. 21.</note> of a statute made in king <hi>Henrie</hi> the eights time, it is to this effect said: that <hi>the people of this Realme, haue bound themselues by long vse and custome, to the obseruance of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine mans lawes (besides those which were ordeined in this Realme) not as to the obseruance of the lawes of any forren Prince, Potentate, or Prelate: but as to the accustomed &amp; ancient lawes of this Realme, originally established as lawes of the same, by the sufferance of Kings, and by consent and custome of the people, and none otherwise.</hi> And a litle after, mention is there made, of <hi>such lawes humane, induced into this Realme; by the said sufferance, consents, and custome.</hi> This is brought to prooue; that <hi>the Parliament or such as it shall autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize, may dispense with those, and with all other humane lawes of this Realme:</hi> for so they be termed. Whereupon, in the body of the statute, ensued that authoritie, which the <hi>Archbishops of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turburie</hi> haue, of granting <hi>faculties,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore the <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane lawes</hi> (spoken of in the <hi>Preamble)</hi> are those <hi>Canon</hi> lawes; which by <hi>such sufferance, vse, and custome</hi> are (now) <hi>as the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed and ancient lawes of this Realme, originally established as lawes of the same:</hi> howbeit by the meanes aforesaid, but <hi>induced into the Realme,</hi> and not here at first <hi>made nor ordeined.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is <note n="2" place="margin">5. Eliz. cap. 25.</note> another statute also, made in her Maiesties time; in the <hi>Preamble</hi> whereof, they be called <hi>the Ecclesiasticall lawes of this Realme.</hi> So that when whole <hi>Parliaments</hi> do aduow them to be <hi>lawes of the Realme,</hi> yea &amp; that for proofe of another point perhaps doutfull: we may then well make but light account of all the <hi>Treatisers</hi> exclamations to the contrary, who calleth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                     </p>
                     <p>Furthermore, it is well and notoriously knowen, that procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings and condemnations Ecclesiasticall in ordinarie Courts were neuer made by <hi>the iudgement of a mans peeres, viz.</hi> by a <hi>Iurie:</hi> and therefore those words rehearsed, can not be so farre extended, as to include that <hi>iurisdiction.</hi> Yet as <hi>institution</hi> vnto a benefice, both before &amp; after <hi>Magna charta,</hi> belonged alwayes to <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> persons and <hi>iurisdiction;</hi> so did also the <hi>destitution</hi>
                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:19125:70"/>
or <hi>depriuation</hi> from a benefice by the <hi>Common</hi> law: in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, <hi>Bishops</hi> (that claime not the patronage) do alwayes plead to a <hi>Quare impedit,</hi> thus; <hi>Nihil clamat praeter institutionem &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutionem Clericorum, vt Ordinarius in dictarectoria de A. &amp;c.</hi> whereby may appeare, that a man might (by law) be put out of his benefice (being his freeholde) otherwise then according to the forme of that statute. And this (by the way) may also shew, how vnsound a collection the <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> maketh, out of those words of <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> where, because <hi>a benefice is a freeholde,</hi> he would inferre that a <hi>Clerke</hi> may not be depriued of his benefice, but by a iudgement at the <hi>Common</hi> law.</p>
                     <p>I haue also proued in the chapter next afore, and in the eight, and the twelft chapters; that an <hi>Ordinarie</hi> in his <hi>dioecesse</hi> (euen at the <hi>Common</hi> law) might condemne a man for <hi>heresie;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon (after committing to the secular power) such an <hi>heretike</hi> was put to death, by burning: but this was not done by any <hi>iudgement of his peeres,</hi> and therfore those words of <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> are no way to be construed of any <hi>iurisdiction ecclesiasticall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Furthermore, besides <hi>iudgement of a mans peeres,</hi> there is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, <hi>or by the law of the land;</hi> which permitteth other triall then by <hi>Peeres:</hi> as by <hi>battell,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now seeing all iurisdiction and authoritie in this Realme, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> as <hi>temporall,</hi> was euer in <hi>right,</hi> but now is also (iustly) acknowledged, and is <hi>infact,</hi> vnited and incorporated vnto the <hi>crowne</hi> of this Realme: therefore inquire, whether vpon the premises it may not be probably said (albeit not according to the vsuall speech) that a iudgement duely giuen by the <hi>iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction ecclesiasticall,</hi> is giuen <hi>by the law of the land?</hi> But this cloud, or rather mist, which they would cast, is also plainely dispersed by the first chapter in <hi>Magna Charta:</hi> for thereby is made a flat distinction and seuerance, betwixt the <hi>grant there made to God,</hi> (with <hi>confirmation of the Church of Englands freedome, rights, and liberties for euermore)</hi> from those <hi>grants</hi> that are after made, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>freemen of the whole Realme,</hi> in the rest of that <hi>charter:</hi> so that the <hi>iurisdiction</hi> of the Church, can not be intended to be meant in any of all the rest, except it be particularly expressed. Yet if those words were admitted to be meant and stretched foorth vnto that <hi>iurisdiction</hi> also, will not statutes made by the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:19125:70"/>
like authoritie of <hi>Parliament,</hi> sufficiently qualifie or impeach the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>?</p>
                     <p>Vnto this head, is that obiection of the <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, where he allegeth out of the <hi>diary acts</hi> of the Clerke of the <hi>Parliament,</hi> I know not how truly, <note n="1" place="margin">4. H. 4. art. 29.</note> that <hi>the Commons exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a petition, that Lollards arrested by the statute of 2. H. 4. should be bailed, and that none should arrest, but the shiriffe or other lawfull officers.</hi> Buthe doth fully answere himselfe therein: for the <hi>kings</hi> answere was (saith he) that <hi>Leroys' aduisera;</hi> which is the forme of dissent, that the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>souereigne Queenes</hi> of this Realme do vse, when they dissent or deny any statute or petition in <hi>Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament</hi> offered vnto them to be confirmed for a law. Whereby we see, that arrests &amp; attaching for crimesmight be made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>enditement</hi> precedent; and by others then the <hi>shiriffe</hi>  and also, that albeit <hi>Magna Charta</hi> had bene to the contrary, yet an act of <hi>Parliament</hi> comming after, might change that law. Wherofifneed were I could shew sundry other examples: not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, that which the <hi>Treatiser</hi> putteth vs in minde of, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>in K. H. 3. time, there was a iust sentence of curse and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathematization, denounced by the Bishops; against the violaters or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breakers of the said great Charter.</hi> But what if <hi>Bishops</hi> should vse the like authority now, to <hi>excommunicate</hi> indefinitely and afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, all such as shall hereafter breake some <hi>temporall</hi> law? it is to be doubted, that the <hi>Treatiser</hi> would not in this case be the same man, nor yet affirme it to be a <hi>iust sentence;</hi> but would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther threaten them with a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> for their kindnesse.</p>
                     <p>It is assured, that <hi>par in parem non habet imperium:</hi> and none authority can so binde it selfe by any law; but that (vpon good occasion and by like power) it may be abrogated againe. Yet how litle this plea of ours is needfull in this case is sufficiently shewed. Yea rather the defenders of these &amp; such like opinions against the rights and liberties of the Church of <hi>England</hi> notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously knowen so to be, by the reported lawes &amp; customes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to them that know any thing in either: had need more iustly to feare that <hi>censure</hi> of the <hi>Bishops,</hi> if it be so <hi>iust;</hi> if so be they cary any feare at all or reuerence vnto the <hi>censures</hi> of the Church, which be so <hi>iustly</hi> inflicted, as themselues do yeeld.</p>
                     <p>As these opinions do onely reach and shoot at the <hi>commission ecclesiasticall,</hi> to impound and streine the authority thereof vnto
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19125:71"/>
so narrow a roome; as that her Maiestie should thereby haue no seruice done by those her subiects which are imployed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; wherby the fansies of the fauorites of these men, might more freely growe without discouery, or any such penal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>ie as they thinke they need care for: so for the iust defence (herein) of that <hi>commission,</hi> I may allege the words of the same statute, whereby it is established; <note n="1" place="margin">1. Eliz. cap. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>viz. They shall haue full power and authoritie, by vertue of this act, and of the said letters patents, vnder your highnesse, your heires or successors, to exercise, vse and execute all the premisses, according to the tenour and effect of the said letters patents, any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or cause to the contrary, in any wise notwithstanding.</hi> By which words, <hi>tenor literarum,</hi> is signified whatsoeuer <hi>tenent in se, viz.</hi> that which is expresly conteined in them: by the <hi>effect of them</hi> is vnderstood, whatsoeuer is within the true and vnforced mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, of any such letters patents. So that if <hi>attachment, fine, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment,</hi> &amp;c. be either in the letters patents expresly contei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (as in trueth they be) or vndoubtedly meant by them; then the vse and excercise of these, shall thereby sufficiently be war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted and authorized vnto her Maiesty for granting; and to the commissioners, for so executing. And if any doubt (otherwise) might be made, yet there be two clauses in the words aforesaid, that be called <hi>verba siue clausulae operatinae:</hi> and do therefore sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply many defects and wants in the exercise of a <hi>iurisdiction,</hi> dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by the Princes <hi>rescript.</hi> The first of them are those words, <hi>Full power &amp; authoritie:</hi> and the other is, the generall <hi>non obstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, in transcendenti, viz.</hi> of <hi>any matter or cause</hi> whatsoeuer.</p>
                     <p>But to all this is answered by some, that these words, <hi>viz. ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tenour and effect of the said letters patents,</hi> do worke thus much: that her <hi>Maiestie</hi> need not grant <hi>all,</hi> but <hi>so much</hi> iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, as her Highnesse thinketh meet: and that so many or few of them (so they be two atleast) may thereby be autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized vnder <hi>her Maiestie,</hi> to exercise such <hi>iurisdiction.</hi> It is true, that those words so worke and import so much: but doeth it heereof follow, that nothing else is meant or can be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended thereby? Nothing (say they:) for other processe then <hi>citation,</hi> or other censures or punishment then <hi>excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>her Maiestie</hi> can not commit vnto them: else <hi>might she also giue them authoritie to hang men.</hi> What? is there no more
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:19125:71"/>
difference with these men, betwixt attaching, fining or impriso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and plaine hanging? What will they then say of the <hi>Starre Chamber,</hi> which may impose all those three, and yet cannot put any man to losse of limme or of life? and this is great reason. For we are taught by the <hi>Ciuill</hi> lawe, (and I thinke it is agreeable al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to the lawes of the land) that wheresoeuer an authoritie is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen (in neuer so generall or pregnant wordes) it cannot be dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen foorth to reach vnto any mutilation of limme, or paines <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall,</hi> except they be plainely expressed.</p>
                     <p>Other some, as the <hi>Treatisour,</hi> doeth answere this obiection in this sort: but yet to the ende of prouing <hi>othes of the parties, in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses criminall</hi> to be vnlawfull, a matter to be handled in the thirde part, viz. <hi>that how general soeuer the words of the acte be in one place, yet are they to be restrained to this particular, viz. none other then such iurisdiction ecclesiasticall, as may be lawfully vsed:</hi> and enten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>(per petitionem principij)</hi> that such <hi>oathes,</hi> be contrary to law. But in this his interpretation (he saith) he contrarieth <hi>diuerse great learned men</hi> in that lawe, <hi>whom it behoueth with a more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe eye to beholde this statute lawe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Truely halfe an eye of a meane learned man, will serue to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer, that he cautelously leaueth out one member of the <hi>disiun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue alternation,</hi> which is in that statute. For it is thus, viz. <hi>all Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdictions &amp;c. whatsoeuer, by any Spirituall or Ecclesiasticall power or authoritie, hath heretofore bene, or may lawfully be exercised, &amp;c.</hi> So that if either it <hi>haue bene</hi> exercised at any time, or hauing not bene put in exercise, yet <hi>lawfully may be;</hi> it is here graunted to <hi>her Maiestie.</hi> And were it in deede meete either in <hi>temporall</hi> or <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> to leaue it to the dispute &amp; determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of euery priuate subiect that is dealt with; what may be <hi>lawfully,</hi> and what may not so be done, in either lawe?</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Treatisour,</hi> nor any other, cannot in answere hereof, say: that the worde <hi>lawfully,</hi> must also be vnderstood as repeated in the first member. First because it is a <hi>disiunctiue proposition;</hi> and therefore that word should haue bin expressed in the first part, if it had bin to be drawen vnto both; and not to haue bin put in the second part onely. Secondly, for that it would then take away from <hi>her Maiestie</hi> all such <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> authoritie (being most lawfully in her <hi>Highnesse)</hi> as was <hi>heretofore exercised</hi> by, or
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19125:72"/>
vnder the <hi>Pope,</hi> by <hi>vsurpation;</hi> and therefore most vnlawfully. Neuerthelesse the matters graunted and exercised by the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,</hi> which are by him chalenged; (I trust, God willing) shall be also otherwise prooued <hi>lawfull</hi> and warrantable. Against <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisoning</hi> by vertue of the <hi>commission</hi> (one of the speciall matters nowe in handling) the said <hi>Treatisour</hi> obiecteth: that, <hi>such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as refuse to sweare to answere the articles exhibited against them, are imprisoned without baile or maineprise: whereas by the lawe ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall, they ought not to be imprisoned, but to be proceeded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, as pro confessis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true, that by <hi>Ordinary</hi> authoritie <hi>ecclesiasticall,</hi> no man may be imprisoned. Therefore the vntying of this knot, resteth vpon the whole matter here disputed of, viz. whether that sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute 10. <hi>Eliz.</hi> doe not warrant <hi>her Maiestie,</hi> to graunt by her Highnes letters patents, power to imprison, for such <hi>contempt,</hi> as this obiection importeth.</p>
                     <p>To prooue that <hi>her Maiestie</hi> may not so graunt, nor they take such authoritie: the <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> affirmeth, that <hi>the commission bindeth them precisely to crimes punishable by the ecclesiasticall lawe; and to proceede according to the ecclesiasticall lawes of this Realme, and not according to the temporall:</hi> quoting fiue statutes for this, albeit there be in none of them any such matter. but both the first and second part of this obiection, is vntrue. For the <hi>commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (though nowe that power be not altogether vsed) graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the execution of foure statutes vnto them, and alloweth them to proceede aswell by <hi>Iuries,</hi> as by course of the lawe <hi>eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall.</hi> And when <hi>Doctor Grindall</hi> was <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> sundry crimes <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> (by vertue of the <hi>commission)</hi> were tried by <hi>Iuries,</hi> before him and certaine <hi>Iudges,</hi> and other professours al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of the <hi>common</hi> lawe; being then in that <hi>commission.</hi> Yet is the <hi>Note-gatherer,</hi> vpon this vntrue ground bold to inferre, that to doe otherwise, is <hi>to encroche vpon the temporall iurisdiction: and to make an hotchepot in one commission.</hi> Truely this his collection is not worth an <hi>hotchepot,</hi> that is a <hi>pudding,</hi> as <hi>Littleton</hi> doeth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound that worde. For the <hi>temporall Iudges</hi> are not to proceede in matters of <hi>ecclesiasticall iurisdiction:</hi> and therefore their <hi>iurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> is not <hi>encroched</hi> vpon, though in such matters <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> attachements or imprisonments be vsed, or fines imposed; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19125:72"/>
they themselues cannot (in those causes) vse or impose them.</p>
                     <p>When the whole Realme at the beginning of <hi>her Maiesties</hi> reigne was visited (by vertue of this statute) by <hi>Diuines, Ciuilia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,</hi> and <hi>Common Lawiers</hi> in that seruice imploied; who had authority by their seuerall <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missions</hi> to attache, imprison, fine, &amp;c. aswell as to vse <hi>censures ecclesiasticall;</hi> al which they did accordingly: then and at that time, none of these quicke <hi>&amp; narrow sighted</hi> fellowes (lately sprung vp) were to be found; that could see more then the reuerend Iudges, and could so roundly tel <hi>her Maiestie,</hi> that she did graunt more authoritie to her <hi>Commissioners,</hi> then by that statute was giuen to her selfe. Oh, belike it was <hi>lawe</hi> then, and good <hi>iustice</hi> against <hi>Papistes:</hi> but to deale against pretended <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formatists,</hi> it commeth farre too short.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Treatisour</hi> vrgeth this matter yet further: he saith, that <hi>no learned man wil affirme, any Iurisdiction (by that acte</hi> 10. <hi>Eliz.) to be vnited to the crowne, but spirituall or ecclesiasticall.</hi> And that none such can affirme, that <hi>any iurisdictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp;c. repugnant or offensiue to the Common or Ciuill Policie of this Kingdome, is established by that Acte: for that there is none Antinomy or contrarietie of lawes.</hi> Whereupon he woulde inferre, that <hi>Attaching, Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonning,</hi> and <hi>Fining &amp;c.</hi> (by vertue thereof) is not warranted to be graunted.</p>
                     <p>In answere whereof, let him vnderstand, that his <hi>argument</hi> followeth not vpon either of those <hi>Antecedents.</hi> For the first, though the <hi>matters</hi> of <hi>iurisdiction</hi> thereby vnited to the crowne, be onely <hi>ecclesiasticall:</hi> yet the <hi>maner</hi> of <hi>conuenting,</hi> or <hi>punishing</hi> in them, is not in that <hi>Acte</hi> so restrained, but that such other courses may be vsed, as to <hi>her Maiesties</hi> wisedome shall seeme most fitte: which by and by shall be shewed God willing. For the second: we deny the maner of <hi>conuenting</hi> and <hi>punishing</hi> establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by the <hi>commission, to be repugnant or offensiue any way to the Ciuill Policie of this kingdome:</hi> for it is warranted by that <hi>Acte.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This point (if the wordes of that whole clause be aduisedly weyed and considered) will be made most plaine. In the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of a <hi>criminall iurisdiction,</hi> there is the <hi>matter,</hi> wherein it is bestowed, the <hi>maner</hi> of conuenting, and <hi>sanction</hi> or penaltie to be inflicted vpon offenders, which are to be considered. Now the <hi>matter</hi> of this <hi>iurisdiction</hi> and authoritie graunted to <hi>her Highnes,</hi>
                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:19125:73"/>
and that may be assigned ouer by <hi>her Maiestie</hi> vnto <hi>Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is visiting, reforming, redressing, ordering, correcting, and amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all such errours, heresies, schismes, abuses, offences, contemptes and enormities whatsoeuer, which by any spirituall, &amp;c.</hi> Yet what course is to be holden in <hi>calling and conuenting,</hi> and what kind of <hi>penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or censures</hi> shalbe inflicted vpon offenders by that authoritie; are by no wordes of that acte expresly graunted to <hi>her Highnes,</hi> or mentioned, that they may be assigned by her vnto the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners;</hi> and therefore of necessitie to be supplied by those generall wordes, viz. <hi>According to the tenour and effect of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters patentes.</hi> For els (by such an interpretation of theirs) we should haue matters for a <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> but neither any <hi>maner</hi> to <hi>conuent</hi> and compell to come afore the <hi>Commissioners;</hi> nor yet <hi>punishment</hi> to lay vpon enormious offendours, against whom it was intended. Which, because it is very vnreasonable; therefore that opinion, whereupon it necessarily followeth, must needes be more absurd, and without ground of reason.</p>
                     <p>Yea (say other of them) be this as it may; and let them seeke out what processes, &amp;c. may and shall be vsed by the <hi>Commission Ecclesiasticall:</hi> for it is contrary to the lawe, to graunt (by <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion)</hi> authoritie to inflict any punishment vpon a faul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>, which (by lawe) ought not to be inflicted: and therefore they gather that the <hi>Queene</hi> cannot authorise, nor any man may take power to <hi>attache,</hi> to <hi>fine,</hi> or to <hi>imprison</hi> men, by that <hi>Commission.</hi> Thus farre it is true, that a <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission</hi> may not be graunted to alter or change any lawe in force: but I trust it is not contrary to the <hi>Common</hi> lawe and custome of the Realme, by acte of <hi>Parliament,</hi> to alter and change that which stoode otherwise afore, at the <hi>Common</hi> lawe.</p>
                     <p>If this so did by the course of the <hi>Common</hi> lawe, no man may be put to the racke or torture (especially about felonies or mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) thereby to drawe him to confesse of himselfe, or of other men, his complices: Yet is it notorious, that in <hi>Wales</hi> and the <hi>Marches</hi> thereof, the <hi>President</hi> and <hi>Counsaile</hi> there established, doe vse, and lawfully may put men to such torture; by warrant of instructions onely sent vnto them from time to time, vnder <hi>her Maiesties</hi> gratious hand.</p>
                     <p>This their authoritie (I take it) is deriued from these <note n="1" place="margin">38. H. 8. ca. 28. Rastall, Wales 32.</note> wordes
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:19125:73"/>
in an <hi>Acte of Parliament: The President and Counsaile there, shall haue power and authoritie, to heare and determine, by their wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes and discretions, such causes and matters, as be or hereafter shall bee assigned to them by the Kings Maiestie, as heretofore hath bene accustomed and vsed.</hi> Which doe conteine no more particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of authoritie, nor yet are of so much pregnancie to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; as the wordes (that establish the <hi>Commission Ecclesiasticall)</hi> be, for <hi>Attachment, fine,</hi> and <hi>imprisonment</hi> to be vsed, if it shall please her <hi>Maiestie</hi> so to commit them.</p>
                     <p>The deuise of the <hi>Commission Ecclesiasticall,</hi> was for assistance and ayde of <hi>Ordinary Iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall;</hi> and for roun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der proceeding, and for more grieuous punishment at least (in these dissolute times) more feared; then can or may by <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie Iurisdiction</hi> be inflicted. Therefore, if by the general words of that Acte, 1. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> both these proceedings whereof wee here speake, and many other particularities of <hi>maner, persons, times, places,</hi> and other <hi>circumstances</hi> might not be warranted: then the authoritie (there) giuen to <hi>her Maiestie,</hi> were of none vse at all, neither could it possibly be practised.</p>
                     <p>But I thinke this power here by these opinions impugned, may be also prooued directly, out of the words of the very Acte, thus: <hi>whatsoeuer by any Spirituall or Ecclesiasticall power or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie hath heretofore bene, or may lawfully bee exercised or vsed for visitation, &amp;c. or reformation, &amp;c. of all maner errours, &amp;c. and enormities whatsoeuer,</hi> that is vnited to the <hi>Crowne,</hi> and by that Acte may be committed ouer by her <hi>Maiestie:</hi> But <hi>Attaching, imprisoning,</hi> and such like corporall coërtion, by some <hi>Spirituall</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> power or authoritie, hath heretofore lawfuly bene exercised: And therefore may be appointed by her <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie</hi> to be now exercised by the <hi>Commissioners Ecclesiasticall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For proofe of the <hi>Minor,</hi> I am to put you in minde, what cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall punishments and chastisements the superiours of euery <hi>Regular</hi> person, as of <hi>Monke, Frier,</hi> and <hi>Nunne,</hi> might and did lawfully from time to time lay vpon them that were vnder their <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> obedience; and yet (euen after their professing) they remained still the Kings subiects.</p>
                     <p>Likewise, when the statutes against <hi>Heresies</hi> were in force, these <hi>Attachings, imprisonings,</hi> and other <hi>corporall chastisements</hi>
                        <pb n="112" facs="tcp:19125:74"/>
were then lawfully exercised and vsed by <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> power and authoritie.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, <note n="1" place="margin">1. H. 7. ca. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Bishops and Ordinaries may lawfully at this day punish and chastise Priestes, Clearkes, and religious men within their Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, being conuicted of incontinencie, by committing them to warde and prison, there to abide, for such time as shall be thought to their discretions co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient, for the qualitie and quantitie of their tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasse.</hi> So that we may conclude, that <hi>if any such power haue bene vsed,</hi> then her <hi>Maiestie may</hi> (as it please her) vse it still; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the same to be vsed by her Highnesse <hi>Commissioners,</hi> howe and vpon whom, she thinketh good.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Treatisour</hi> himselfe testifieth, that <hi>diuers euen of the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned sort, do hold and affirme (and that very confidently) that the Acte and Commission thereupon, doe giue full power and authoritie for any course soeuer, for the gouernment in causes Ecclesiasticall, that shall be mentioned in the letters Patents.</hi> This he exemplifieth by sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry examples, though holden by such <hi>learned men,</hi> which neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse he accounteth contrary to Lawe: whereof some fall in most fitte for this place (because they are bent against the saide <hi>Commission)</hi> and others for other places of this <hi>Apologie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First he thinketh it very absurde and not warrantable; that the <hi>Commissioners Ecclesiasticall shoulde commaunde Iustices of Peace, to assist any for attaching and imprisoning of offenders till they giue bonde for appearance.</hi> And saith, this is <hi>against Lawe and Iustice.</hi> The onely reason he rendreth of this his assertion, is: for that <hi>Iustices of Peace bee Magistrates, and Commissioners of Recorde, authorised, as well as the other.</hi> Belike himselfe is some <hi>Iustice of peace: Hoc vrit hominem, qui imperare, non parêre didicit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And will he then (vpon his learning) deliuer; <hi>That no Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate or Commissioner of Recorde, may be commaunded by another; though no lesse be warranted by his Commission?</hi> Hereupon would follow, that <hi>Iustices of Peace and Sherifs</hi> might not be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in any case by the <hi>Iudges of either Benche,</hi> by the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> by the <hi>Iustices of Assisse,</hi> by the <hi>L. Treasourer,</hi> by the <hi>L Chauncel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour</hi> or <hi>L. Keeper;</hi> nor yet by the whole <hi>Counsell boord.</hi> He thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it also not iustifiable, that <hi>any Magistrates should be comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by the Ecclesiasticall Commissioners to assist in Attaching, or to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:19125:74"/>
attache any, vpon a warrant, called Quorum nomina.</hi> For reason of vnlawfulnesse hereof, he alledgeth: <hi>that no cause or matter is therein expressed or declared.</hi> But this might be <hi>(de facto)</hi> omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in any other <hi>warrant,</hi> as well as in that. and yet is it vntrue, that <hi>in this kinde of warrant, no cause is declared.</hi> But admit it were otherwise; what Lawe of the <hi>Realme</hi> is against it? And if the like warrant shall come from the <hi>Lords of the Counsell</hi> to him, or any other <hi>Iustice of the Peace,</hi> to be ayding and assisting vnto some <hi>Messenger,</hi> in attaching of certaine persons to be caried vp vnto them as Prisoners, whom the saide <hi>Messenger</hi> shall name vnto them: will hee refuse to intermeddle in the seruice as sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising <hi>the Lords</hi> to do therein against Lawe; because they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde him being a <hi>Iustice of Recorde;</hi> and for that they signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie not by their <hi>Warrant,</hi> what the particular <hi>cause</hi> is, where with they minde to charge such persons that are to be <hi>Attached?</hi> But if in so doing their <hi>Lordships</hi> doe nothing contrary to Lawe, howsoeuer he doe foolishly and vndutifully to refuse to giue his assistance: why shall the Lawe anymore be against the <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioners,</hi> doing but the like; and that by expresse <hi>Warrant</hi> of her <hi>Maiesties</hi> letters Patents?</p>
                     <p>Another reason, why such <hi>Warrant</hi> should not be iustifiable, he doth alledge: because <hi>the names of such persons to be Attached be not set downe by the Commissioners, but are referred ouer vnto others to set them downe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mine answere hereunto is: First, that the <hi>Warrant</hi> of <hi>Quorum nomina,</hi> is very rarely vsed by the <hi>Commission,</hi> and the rarer, the better. Secondly, when it is vsed, the names of the <hi>parties</hi> are set downe and allowed (afore) by the <hi>Commissioners,</hi> and not by others, for anything that I can learne. Neuerthelesse there may be good and weightie occasions, to omit this course: as when such <hi>Warrant</hi> is directed to a man of qualitie and good credite, that he may put in the names; for this ende lest when one is ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, he bewray all to the rest, whose names be also in the same <hi>Warrant,</hi> that they may conuey themselues out of the way. Howsoeuer it be in this behalfe, I thinke the <hi>Treatisour</hi> will be long in finding out how this should be reckoned, to be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Lawes of this <hi>Realme.</hi>
                        <pb n="114" facs="tcp:19125:75"/>
Hitherto touching the challenges made to some particular points, in the maner of exercising that <hi>Commissun.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Note-gatherer,</hi> (to cut off all these particular disputes) alleadgeth; that <hi>it may be thought, the whole Commission is voyde in Lawe.</hi> For that (as he surmiseth) <hi>it beareth date in Iuly, but was signed in Nouember next after;</hi> 
                        <note n="1" place="margin">18. H. 6. cap. primo.</note> 
                        <hi>contrary to a Statute.</hi> What? was this quarrell which is now picked against it, worth the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, of abusing a <hi>Counsellours</hi> name, to procure a copie thereof? Well, both the <hi>Preamble</hi> and body of the statute also doth cleare this cauill. For by the <hi>Preamble</hi> it appeareth; that the mischiefe to be remedied was: <hi>for that by grauntes antedated long before the King graunted them, other grauntees who (in very trueth) had the first graunt and great seale set to it, (yet bearing date truely)</hi> were expelled by colour of letters Patents, bearing the elder date. In the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Acte</hi> is conteined this particle <hi>Such,</hi> which is of restraint, viz. <hi>That the King (willing to put out such slye deuises or imaginations)</hi> did ordeine by <hi>Parliament;</hi> that <hi>letters Patents should be dated the day of their deliuery into the Chauncery; or else be voyde.</hi> Now if this Statute were to be vnderstood of all <hi>letters Patents</hi> whatsoeuer, where is the reason of that Lawe found in a <hi>Commission?</hi> but, <hi>ratio, est animalegis: &amp; cessante ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione, cessat Lex.</hi> Therefore this Statute can be stretched to none other <hi>letters Patents</hi> but <hi>Such,</hi> as the mischiefe mentioned in the <hi>Preamble,</hi> may happen into.</p>
                     <p>Yea, if it were otherwise to be vnderstoode; he must (ere any will beleeue him) bring more euident matter then this: viz, <hi>It is thought,</hi> and <hi>It may bee thought.</hi> Let him then goe seeke the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords in the <hi>Chauncery;</hi> and see, whether the date and the day of the deliuery of it, doe not agree: and so may hee haue more colour to wrest the statute, when he doth not misreport the matter <hi>in facte,</hi> as herein hee hath done.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XV.</hi> That an Ecclesiasticall person may be depriued of his benefice without enditement or prosecution of partie.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the next opinion, I minde to be very short: it is this, <hi>that by none ecclesiasticall authoritie, a man may be depriued of his benefice (which is his freeholde) being not endited, and no suite of partie offered against him.</hi> Whereby (we see) he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth both an enditement, and a suite of some partie. It seemeth his meaning is, that a Minister cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued, but by way of <hi>enditement</hi> at the Common law, and that the Iudge <hi>(of Office)</hi> may not preferre such <hi>enditement;</hi> but it must needs be at the sute of a <hi>partie.</hi> I can not well coniecture, whereupon he pretendeth to ground this opinion. If vpon the 29 chapter of <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> it is shewed in the chapter next precedent, not to be vnderstood of <hi>Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction,</hi> or of the practice thereof. And moreouer, that chapter in <hi>Magna Charta</hi> requireth no suite of partie to preferre the <hi>enditement;</hi> so that it may be done by the Iudges <hi>of Office</hi> well enough.</p>
                     <p>But this conceit is very strange, that <hi>Bishops</hi> shall not haue au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie to depriue an <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> person from his benefice. It is shewed in the chapter afore, that by vsuall and allowed course of pleading to a <hi>Quare impedit,</hi> the Ordinarie doeth claime (as of common right) <hi>institutionem &amp; destitutionem Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricorum,</hi> in benefices within his <hi>iurisdiction.</hi> And the olde rule was, <hi>Cuius estinstituere, eius est destituere.</hi> But perhaps it will be said, he meant, that a <hi>Bishop</hi> might doe it, but not of <hi>Office,</hi> that is, without a partie, albeit he put a Copulatiue in stead of a Disiunctiue.</p>
                     <p>But if his meaning be such, he meaneth more then is true. And further, what priuilege or benefite is this to the partie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented, to be prosecuted by a <hi>partie,</hi> (and therefore perhaps of malice and by subornation of proofs) rather then by the <hi>ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> proceeding <hi>of office</hi> and <hi>duetie,</hi> for whose sinceritie, we may more probably presume and intend?</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, what if one that hath a benefice will come vnto the <hi>Bishop,</hi> and there stoutly defend <hi>Atheisme, Apostasie,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19125:76"/>
of <hi>Christ,</hi> or any other <hi>heresie,</hi> grosse <hi>blasphemy,</hi> or <hi>idolatry:</hi> may he not (till some <hi>accuser</hi> be found, or a <hi>partie</hi> to prosecute) depriue such a person from his benefice <hi>ex Officio?</hi> What if the beneficed person will confesse before the <hi>Ordinarie,</hi> that he was neuer called to the Ministerie, but hath vsurped it, by colour of forged <hi>testimonials of Orders:</hi> or that he hath committed <hi>Simo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, Incest, Adulterie,</hi> or hath two wiues liuing at once, or <note n="1" place="margin">13.

But that he may do it, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth <note n="2" place="margin">1.

                        <hi>CHAP. XVI.</hi> That after fortie dayes, an excommunicate person may be otherwise punished, then vpon the writ De excommunicato capiendo: And that the said writ may and ought to be awarded vpon contempts, rising on other originall causes ecclesiasticall, then any of those ten crimes mentioned in the statute 5. <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 23.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He last opinions to be handled in this part, be these: <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>an excommunicate person stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding so aboue fortie dayes, may in none other sort be punished then vpon the writ De excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to capiendo.</hi> The other is: that, <hi>the said writ De excommunicato capiendo, ought not at all to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded vpon contempts rising from any other originall causes then vpon some of the tenne crimes, that be mentioned in the statute</hi> 5. Eliz. cap. 23. The first is easily impugned: for he may be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished twentie pounds by moneth, for absence from diuine prayer: neither shall his excommunication excuse him, for it is in his owne default. Besides, it is a great <hi>contempt</hi> in an ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall cause, and therefore punishable by the <hi>Ecclesiasticall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,</hi> vpon the expresse wordes vsed in that <hi>Act,</hi> which doeth
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:19125:76"/>
establish that <hi>Commission.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this standeth with reason, where there are great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of such wilfull persons, or slacke execution by <hi>Vnder-shirifs</hi> and <hi>Bailifs</hi> of that writ, as often falleth out; besides the great charges, in suing of it out. For I dare auow that in sundrie dioe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesses in the Realme, the whole yeerely reuenues of the <hi>Bishops</hi> there, would not reach to the iusticing of all such <hi>contemners</hi> (being of the baser sort of persons) by the course of this writ. They might happely to the great charge of the <hi>shire,</hi> keepe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them in prison long enough: yet they should neuer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the fees backe againe, that first, whether for rich or poore must be defrayed, for want of ability in the persons so excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, the <hi>law ecclesiasticall</hi> very reasonably &amp; grauely proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in this behalfe, that if a <note n="1" place="margin">c. excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camus. §. qui au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. ex. de haere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic.</note> man stand excommunicate aboue an whole yere, he may be proceeded with for suspicion of <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sy:</hi> because the law presumeth, that such a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath smal feeling of religion, but rather contemneth it, and nourisheth some dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable opinion against <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Church.</hi> And therefore, such an excommunicate person, may be punished by reason thereof, otherwise then by that writ.</p>
                     <p>All the colour of reason that I find alleged against this course, by the <hi>Treatiser,</hi> is thus: that on our behalfe it will be said; <hi>this is a shorter way then the other pursuite of the writ De excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato capiendo; being ouer-trouble some and full of vnnecessary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.</hi> But hereunto he doth answer, <hi>that we forget the olde and true saying: Compendiaria res improbitas, virtus longa.</hi> Now if he will haue this to be a good answere, then must he holde; the <hi>shorter</hi> way alwayes to be the <hi>woorse,</hi> and the <hi>longer</hi> the <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> And where is then the rule of <hi>Logike, Frustrà fit per plura, quod fieri potest per pauciora?</hi> and how is he so suddenly fallen out with himselfe, that else-where condemneth Courts <hi>ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> for <hi>lingering consistories?</hi> I perceiue neither <hi>long</hi> nor <hi>short</hi> will please him <hi>long</hi> together. But his reason is <hi>a fallacie of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent.</hi> For though it be but a <hi>short</hi> cut vnto <hi>wickednesse;</hi> and the way vnto <hi>vertue</hi> be <hi>long and hard:</hi> yet is not all length commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable, nor yet are all short courses condemnable.</p>
                     <p>The latter opinion of the two, here also to be handled; doth
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:19125:77"/>
crosse &amp; thwart other of their owne opinions: for the <hi>Ciuill</hi> law saith: <hi>Frustrà fertur sententia, nisi parata sit executio.</hi> A decree or iudgement is of no effect, where execution of such sentence can not be had. The <hi>Iudges ecclesiasticall</hi> haue no <hi>compulsorie</hi> meanes to put their iudgements vnto finall execution, sauing <hi>excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication,</hi> &amp; the writ <hi>De excommunicato capiendo,</hi> after forty dayes obstinacie. Those of the impugners of <hi>ecclesiasticall iurisdiction</hi> (vnder pretence of the lawes of the Realme) that be straitest la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced; doe yeeld causes <hi>testamentarie</hi> and <hi>matrimoniall</hi> to be of ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall conusance; and (I hope) sundry others be prooued no lesse to be.</p>
                     <p>Now how shall any of those be euer effectually proceeded in, seeing they are none of the <hi>tenne crimes</hi> reckoned in that <hi>sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute;</hi> if for not performance of that which is decreed, the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full partie shall neuer be attached, for persisting vnder excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication?</p>
                     <p>It appeareth also plainly by the <hi>Preamble,</hi> that the sayd sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute was enacted, for better assistance vnto iurisdiction ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall, by more due execution of the writ <hi>De excommunicato capiendo;</hi> especially against offenders in crimes of ecclesiasticall conusance. The <hi>Ordinaries</hi> (afore this) who had to deale in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny matter ecclesiasticall, and all subiects that sued any other there, had this interest; of hauing a contemptuous person being excommunicated, and so remaining aboue fortie dayes; to be attached and imprisoned by vertue of that writ; vpon what o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall cause ecclesiasticall soeuer such contempt grew. Now if that statute prouiding but a straiter course for execution of that writ, in tenne crimes onely; should with all take away the force and vse of it, as it stood afore at the Common law; not onely in sundrie other crimes of ecclesiasticall conusance still there punishable; but also in all causes <hi>Testamentarie, Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall, of tithes,</hi> and in all other rights ecclesiasticall in that Court onely still demandable: then should it worke a cleane contrary effect to the very true drift and scope aimed at; and to the meaning it selfe of the Law-makers. But this is very vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and absurd to imagine. for, <hi>quae in fauorem sunt introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta, non debent in odium retorqueri:</hi> and, <hi>quae ad vnum effectnm pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantur, non debent contrarium operari effectum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="119" facs="tcp:19125:77"/>
It is true, that in the beginning of the body of that Statute, the words be generall in this sort, viz. <hi>Euery Writ of excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cato capiendo, that shall be granted out of the high court of Chancerie, against any person or persons, &amp;c.</hi> Whereupon some very learned in those lawes haue thought, that the maner of <hi>granting</hi> it, <hi>retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi> and <hi>deliuering</hi> it, which be there especified; doeth reach vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all and euery writ <hi>de excommunicato capiendo:</hi> but yet that the new penalties there prouided for such person excommunicate, as shall not yeeld his bodie; are to be restrained vnto those one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, who by <hi>Significauit</hi> are certified to haue bene <hi>excommunicated vpon some cause or contempt, arising vpon some originall matter of some of those ten crimes,</hi> there especified.</p>
                     <p>This seemeth to carie great reason with it: for in trueth (that generalitie there not withstanding) not only in the <hi>Preamble,</hi> but in diuers partes of the body of that statute, we find wordes taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue and of restraint; carying the chiefe purport of that Act vnto such writs, as be grounded vpon some of those <hi>ten crimes.</hi> For the <hi>Preamble</hi> onely speaketh, <hi>of persons offending in many great crimes and offences:</hi> of <hi>continuing in their sinnefull and criminous life,</hi> and of <hi>such offenders.</hi> And the beginning of the bodie of the Statute is: <hi>for redresse thereof be it, &amp;c.</hi> and afterward this word of <hi>Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> is often vsed, viz. <hi>Such writ of excommunicato capiendo: such persons excommunicate;</hi> and <hi>such Significauit.</hi> And therefore that statute nor any <hi>Prouiso</hi> in it ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be entended, generally to take away the writ <hi>de excommunicato capiendo,</hi> in all causes, sauing in those <hi>ten crimes;</hi> as by this opinion is enforced.</p>
                     <p>But the clause thereof, <hi>Sauing and reseruing to all persons hauing authoritie to certifie excommunicate persons;</hi> doth put all this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of doubt and dispute. For thereby is <hi>saued</hi> and <hi>reserued to them like authoritie to accept and receiue the submissions &amp; satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: to absolue and release, and to signifie:</hi> and <hi>thereupon to haue such writs, &amp;c. in such maner and forme as heretofore</hi> (respectiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie) <hi>they haue vsed, as hath bene accustomed; and as they or any of them had, or ofright ought or might haue had: anything in that sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute specified or conteined, to the contrary here of, notwithstanding.</hi> If then they may still <hi>signifie in like maner and forme,</hi> shall <hi>haue writs</hi> thereupon, may <hi>absolue and release, receiue satisfaction and submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, &amp;c.</hi> as they <hi>had done before that time:</hi> then may and ought the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:19125:78"/>
writ <hi>de excommunicato capiendo,</hi> to be awarded for contempt ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing on other originall causes ecclesiasticall, then any of those <hi>ten crimes</hi> in that statute reckoned. For so <hi>Ordinaries</hi> did, and had afore that time, and since also; whatsoeuer this opinion now doeth deliuer to the contrary.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Prohibition</hi> is a charge by the kings writ, to forbeare to hold <hi>Plea,</hi> either in some <hi>matter</hi> or <hi>maner,</hi> which it is supposed a man dealeth in, beyond his iurisdiction, or otherwise then lawe will warrant. Euery <hi>Prohibition</hi> is either <hi>Prohibitio iuris</hi> by the very lawe it selfe; or <hi>Prohibitio hominis,</hi> where the ministerie of the competent iudges (in that behalfe) is vsed.

                     </p>
                     <p>In a <hi>prohibition</hi> we are to consider; In what matter it lieth not, at what time it lieth not, where and when it lieth, &amp; how it cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth or looseth his force. For the first, it is <note n="2" place="margin">18.

                        <note n="3" place="margin">M. 2. H. 4. fol. 15.</note> said; <hi>when we see the iurisdiction belongeth not to vs; wee will graunt a Consultation.</hi> So that if the matter be meere Ecclesiasticall, there lieth no <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Touching the second point, it seemeth a <hi>Prohibition</hi> is not to be granted, till by sight of the <hi>Libel,</hi> there appeare cause to grant it. For <note n="4" place="margin">31. H. 6. fol. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>Henkstone</hi> held, that <hi>by the statute de Regia prohibitione &amp;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:19125:78"/>
de coniunctim fe offatis in fine, a man shall not haue prohibition, ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam lis sit contestata in curia spirituali: which is, till a libell be put in, and the partie put to answere it: &amp; this is to be certified to the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor by the view of the Libell:</hi> which <hi>Fortescue granted.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But this hath two exceptions: one is, when the copie of the Libell (contrary to the Statute 2. H. 5.) is denied: for vpon this cause, I finde <hi>a</hi> 
                        <note n="1" place="margin">M. 4. E. 4. fol. 37</note> 
                        <hi>prohibition granted, that the Ordinarie should sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cease, till the copie of the Libell, according to that statute, were deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> another exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is in some court, where a surmise is made, that the suite (in trueth) is for some other matters, then are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in the Libell: for <hi>Brooke</hi> reporteth <hi>that</hi>

                        <hi>a man may haue a prohibition in the kings Bench vpon such a surmise (as for example by surmising the suite to be (in deede) for great timber, though it bee demanded in the Libel, vnder the name of Sylua caedua) but he saith it is otherwise in the Common Pleas.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Touching the third point, for what causes a <hi>Prohibition</hi> is granted: I find it may be granted either in respect of some of the parties to the sute, or in regard of the Iudge before whom it is, or for the very matter handled.

                        <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of a Church do sue another Parsons farmour or seruant for right of tithes, being not such as can trie the right of tithes:</hi> Fineux <hi>held that a prohibition may be granted.</hi> Here of see further in the 6. chap. afore.</p>
                     <p>Touching the second; it may be granted, either for the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges contempt; as in not deliuering copie of the Libell, as is afore touched: or for that he hath not (in deed) any iurisdiction. for so it was iudged by <hi>Hankeford</hi> and by the whole Court, (as it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth) in the vicar of <hi>Saltash</hi> his <note n="4" place="margin">M. 2.

Though a Consultation did otherwise lie, the court wil not grant it to one, that hath no iurisdiction in right.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Concerning the third and last poynt of the three, if the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter bee <hi>Temporall,</hi> that is such, <hi>as</hi>

                        <hi>when one &amp; the selfe same case is debated before Iudges spiritual and temporal (as for beating of a Clerke) there the statute is; that (notwithstanding the spirituall iudgement) the kings

Court also shall debate it.</hi> For both these conisances tending the one to the <hi>amends,</hi> the other to the <hi>excommunication;</hi> may stand together, as is shewed in the 8. chapter.</p>
                     <p>The second exception hereof seemeth to be, <note n="1" place="margin">T. 9. H. 3. per Fitzh. Prohib.</note>

                        <hi>as it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, that the right of tithes comes in debate, the laie Court shall cease, and be out of iurisdiction: and the same law is of the spirituall Court: for if it may appeare, that the right of aduowson may come in debate, although it appeared not at first, the spirituall Court must surcease: quod fuit concessum.</hi> This may happen (as for example) when suite is brought (at first) for right of tithes; and it fals out by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions or otherwise; <hi>that the tithes</hi>

                     <p>There be two statutes, whereupon it is principally grounded. The first is <note n="4" place="margin">27. Ed. 3. cap. 1. de Prouisor.</note> of <hi>Prouisors,</hi> established in the time of king <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. the complaint and griefe there propounded was, that the <hi>kings people were drawen out of the Realme, to answere vnto things, whereof the Conisance pertaineth to the kings Court: and that iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there giuen were impeached in another court.</hi> The mischiefes then noted thereupon were, <hi>the preiudice and disherison of the king and of his crowne, and of all the people of the Realme: and the vndo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and destruction of the Common lawe of the Realme.</hi> The remedie there giuen for these mischieues was: that <hi>if any of what conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on soeuer (being of the kings liegeance) should drawe any out of the realme in plea, whereof the Conusance pertaineth to the kings court, or of things, whereof iudgements be giuen in the kings court, or which do

where? <hi>neither within the realme nor without, &amp;c.</hi> vpon paines there at large conteined.</p>
                     <p>Of those generall heads whereunto I said afore, that all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions of <hi>Praemunire</hi> might be referred, there be some that being expressed in these statutes, are (I thinke) without all doubt, to be within the compasse thereof: as by the first of these two, <hi>to draw any of the Queenes liegeance out of the realme in a plea, whereof the conisance pertaineth, or iudgements be giuen in the kings Court.</hi> And that which is sayd of <hi>a Plea in the kings court,</hi> is also drawen by some opinion, vnto a court Ecclesiasticall, for <note n="1" place="margin">9. Ed. 4. fol. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Yeluerton in the Kings bench held opinion oftentimes, that if a Clerke doe sue another in the Court of Rome for a spiritnall matter, whereof he may haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie within the realme, that he is in case of Praemunire,</hi> quia trahit in placitum extra regnum. And <note n="2" place="margin">Fitzh. Noua nat. br. fol. 44. lit. H.</note> 
                        <hi>Fitzh.</hi> holdeth, that <hi>for collation of a Prebend sued out of the realme, a prohibition doeth lie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondlie, it is an vndoubted <hi>Praemunire</hi> by that statute <hi>to sue in another court, to defeate or impeach the iudgements giuen in the kings court.</hi> In these wordes of (another court) there seemeth to be an opposition and seuerance of such a court, from the <hi>Kings court:</hi> the rather, because both the <hi>Preamble</hi> and the body of the statute do mention, <hi>drawing men out of the realme in Plea.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of at that time there was no colour for any man to be drawen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny whither, but onely to the court of the bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he resided there at <hi>Auignon</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> (where the Popes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that time did lie 70. yeeres together) at <hi>Bononie,</hi> or else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheresoeuer.</p>
                     <p>Therefore for the true vnderstanding of those words enquire: If any of this realme of late yeeres (whiles the parliament of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> was established by the authoritie of the <hi>French</hi> king) vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, that the <hi>Queenes mai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:19125:81"/>
Thirdly, it is an vndoubted <hi>Praemunire</hi> according to the later of the foresaid two statutes, <hi>to purchase or pursue, or to procure so to be done, in the court of Rome or else-where, any such translations &amp;c. or any other things, which touch the King, be against him, his Crowne and Regaltie, or his Realme, as is</hi> (there) <hi>aforesaid: or &amp;c.</hi> as is there further conteined.</p>

                        <hi>was it holden by some, that a benefice Donatiue by the Patron is a meere lay thing, and the Bishop shall not visit it, and therefore shall not depriue from it, and if he meddle in this case, it is a</hi> Praemunire: and sayth that <hi>Barlow</hi> bishop of <hi>Bathe,</hi> for depriuing the <hi>Deane</hi> that had it as a <hi>Donatiue</hi> by the Kings Letters patents, was driuen to sue a pardon.</p>

                        <hi>Fineux</hi> chiefe <note n="3" place="margin">15.

                     <p>It is holden, that <hi>a Prohibition doth</hi> 
                        <note n="4" place="margin">24. H. 8. titulo Praemu. num. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>often lie, where a</hi> Praemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire <hi>doth not: as of tithes of great trees &amp;c. for the nature of the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction doth belong to the Spirituall court, albeit not that very cause in that forme; but when it is of a lay matter, or of a thing that neuer did belong vnto the Court spirituall, herein</hi> (as is said) <hi>there lieth a</hi> Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire.</p>
                     <p>But these notwithstanding, sundry doubts are made in this behalfe, because at this day all <hi>iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall</hi> is now truely acknowledged, and is <hi>in deed</hi> (as it was alwayes <hi>in law)</hi> in the <hi>Souereigne prince,</hi> and from her <hi>prerogatiue royall</hi> deriued downe to others, no lesse then the <hi>Admirall</hi> court is, or the court of the <hi>Constable of England</hi> in times past was, when it was vsed: albeit they vsed their peculiar seales, and names to the processes there sped. And I haue heard very credibly, that some reuerend and great learned Iudges (whiles they liued) were of opinion,
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:19125:82"/>
that for an <hi>Ecclesiasticall Iudge</hi> to deale in a matter apperteining (in very truth) to a <hi>Temporall</hi> court, yet for some neerenesse and cohere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, by him probably supposed to be an <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> cause; could not at this day be a <hi>Praemunire;</hi> but subiect onely to a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition,</hi> and punishable as a <hi>contempt,</hi> as it was at the Common law, vpon an attachment after <hi>Prohibition.</hi> Which opinion if it be sound; then the <hi>Treatiser</hi> is farre wide from the truth, where he saith: that for men <hi>to deale in any cause not belonging to their iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction, is Praemunire.</hi> This were very hard and rigorous, if eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie mistaking or going beyond their commission by Iustices of Peace, by any Iudges ecclesiasticall or temporall, should be no lesse then <hi>Praemunire.</hi> I haue heard it deliuered by great Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, that so to do, doth but make the Actvoid, as being <hi>coram non Iudice,</hi> and inferreth no such grieuous penaltie. For it is alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that <hi>(Alibi)</hi> in the statute was put in, to enclude processes deriued from the <hi>Popes</hi> authoritie, albeit he kept his abode any where els then at <hi>Rome.</hi> In which respect it is affirmed in a <note n="1" place="margin">25. H. 8. ca. 21.</note> sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; that the said statute of <hi>Prouision</hi> and <hi>Praemunire</hi> 16. R. 2. was made against such as sue to the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> against the kings crowne <hi>and dignitie royall.</hi> And it seemeth to some, that <hi>Alibi</hi> can not now signifie <hi>Bishops</hi> and their Courts, which are called the <hi>Queenes Ecclesiasticall courts and Iudges,</hi> and the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons</hi> by law established, the <hi>Queenes Ecclesiasticall lawes.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch, as <hi>the power giuen by statute to her Maiestie, by her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents to</hi> 
                        <note n="2" place="margin">1. El. cap. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>name such as shall execute all maner of iurisdictions touching or concerning any Spirituall or Ecclesiasticall power,</hi> is brought <note n="3" place="margin">8. El. cap. 1. in the Preamble.</note> 
                        <hi>to prooue the sufficient ordinarie authoritie, that Bishops haue giuen vnto them, by the very Letters Patents directed from her Highnesse, for their confirming and consecrating, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is further alleged, that such dealing of an Ordinary <hi>toucheth not the King, against him, his Crowne and Regalie, or Realme,</hi> as not falling into any of the mischiefs, whereof that statute was meant to be a remedie.</p>
                     <p>And for that (all iurisdiction <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> is now both in <hi>fact</hi> and <hi>Law</hi> vnited to the <hi>Crowne,</hi> and from thence deriued) if it should be sayd that the handling of a matter but in an incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent court (yet established by the <hi>Queenes</hi> authoritie) were in that high degree of offence &amp; punishment against her <hi>Crowne:</hi>
                        <pb n="127" facs="tcp:19125:82"/>
some thinke it reacheth thus farre; as to implie an incompatibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie betwixt the <hi>Crowne</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction;</hi> and so by implication, to denie her <hi>iust Royall prerogatiue</hi> ouer all persons, and in all causes aswell <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> as <hi>Temporall;</hi> as if these could not both flow from the <hi>Crowne,</hi> nor stand together and meet in one person; which is most erroneous to thinke, and traiterous to affirme.</p>
                     <p>It is likewise alleged, that this were to make in effect a <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire</hi> to lie in euery case, where a <hi>Prohibition</hi> may, and alwayes hath serued the turne. Whereas a <hi>Praemunire</hi> seemeth to be as a remedie prouided, where a <hi>Prohibition</hi> could not serue, to stay the course of proceeding. And that euen before the supremacy was acknowledged to the <hi>Crowne,</hi> no <hi>Praemunire</hi> vpon this point (onely) is reported in the bookes of termes and yeeres, to haue bene inflicted: but onely for pursuing pleas of the conusance of the kings court out of the Realme, seeking to defeat iudgements there giuen, and procuring Bulles from the court of <hi>Rome,</hi> in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation of the lawes of the Realme.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, it is to this purpose alleged, that by the <note n="1" place="margin">3. &amp; 4. Edw. 6. cap. 11.</note> statute au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorising two and thirtie persons to set downe lawes <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> though repealed, it was prouided (as they thinke) in affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the law, that <hi>no man for executing any of them, should haue incurred contempt, paine, forfeiture, losse, nor haue bene in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of any action or suite of praemunire.</hi> Yet if such lawes had bene framed, the <hi>Iudges ecclesiasticall</hi> might (by mistaking) haue giuen some cause of <hi>prohibition.</hi> Therefore it is gathered by like equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to be very hard, that an <hi>Ecclesiasticall Iudge</hi> meaning to do his dutie, and but to execute <hi>Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction ecclesiastically,</hi> yet by similitude and neere coherence of one matter with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, mistaking and so exceeding his authoritie (a thing very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie in the <hi>Common</hi> law, wherein sometimes do happen varietie of iudgements, amongst the oldest professers of it) if before any <hi>prohibition</hi> brought (as it were to forwarne him) he should here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon de drawen at the very first push into a <hi>praemunire.</hi> For by like reason, if a court <hi>Baron</hi> should heare plea of a matter aboue fortie shillings, a <hi>praemunire</hi> in stead of a <hi>prohibition</hi> might be brought against them.</p>
                     <p>Therefore enquire, and seeke to enforme your selfe aswell
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:19125:83"/>
in the premisses, as of these questions following, what is to be holden for law: <hi>viz.</hi> in holding plea in an Ecclesiasticall court <note place="margin">1.

                     <p>And whether the Iudge be in danger before the matter be <note place="margin">2. Doubt.</note> opened vnto him, or no? For I thinke in no Court temporall or ecclesiasticall, the Iudges peruse the writs, declarations &amp;c. when they are first put in.</p>
                     <p>And whether it be as great an offence in law but to hold plea, <note place="margin">3. Doubt.</note> as to giue iudgement, and to award execution in an Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call court of a temporall matter?</p>

                     <p>Also what offence it is to make lawes temporall or ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall without the Princes assent? <note place="margin">7. Doubt.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>What it is to deale in temporall causes or courts, without <note place="margin">8. Doubt.</note> commission? and what in ecclesiasticall?</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He second part of this treatise contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth our proofes, together with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere to the obiections made against the maner of practise of</hi> iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall <hi>by those, who do euen professe themselues to endeuour an innouation in the frame of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Church of</hi> England. <hi>But wee meane not in this place to handle all, which they obiect in this behalfe, but only some such of them, as touch the</hi> maner <hi>and fourme of the proceedings in the exercise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. For it is knowen they take sundry other exceptions, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the maner of</hi> calling to function Ecclesiasticall, <hi>against the</hi> ordination, <hi>against sundry the</hi> callings and <hi>the</hi> functions themselues, <hi>against deriuing of the</hi> iurisdiction
<pb facs="tcp:19125:85"/>
Ecclesiastical <hi>from the</hi> Prince, <hi>against the</hi> matters hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>by that iurisdiction, and against</hi> the maner of handling <hi>them in sundry other respects, condemning them as</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian <hi>and contrary to Gods word. All which are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther consideration, and not fit here to be ripped vp.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I finde foure opinions (pretending that the lawes of the Realme be against the</hi> maner of entrance <hi>into some suites, and against</hi> certaine proceedings <hi>Ecclesiasticall) that are mentioned in the generall</hi> Preface <hi>to haue bene put off vnto this place, for auoyding of needelesse repetition, and as falling here more fit to be discussed, among other like obiections of the</hi> Innouatours.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The first of them that we put ouer vnto this place is, that</hi> an Ecclesiasticall court may not proceede without ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation or presentment: <hi>meaning (as I take it) a present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Officers sworne for that purpose. If this were true (according as the proprietie of the wordes importeth) then</hi> Ordinaries <hi>might not so much as deale in those two excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> causes <hi>of</hi> matrimonie <hi>and</hi> testament, <hi>nor in any other concerning</hi> rights <hi>and</hi> dueties Ecclesiasticall, <hi>but onely in offences and</hi> crimes <hi>punishable by that iurisdiction. For</hi> an accusation <hi>or</hi> presentment <hi>hath none vse, but in matters of</hi> crime <hi>or</hi> offence <hi>incident vnto that iurisdiction to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish. Besides that, this opinion doth contradict the next fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. For this implieth, that if the matter be Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and that there be either accusation or such</hi> presentment; <hi>then may the Iudge Ecclesiasticall proceede; so that if there be but</hi> a presentment <hi>without</hi> any accusation, <hi>his procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding without a partie, which is to proceede</hi> ex officio, <hi>shall be warranted. Whereupon doeth followe, that proceeding</hi> ex officio <hi>is not tied to those two causes onely</hi> of Testament <hi>or</hi> Matrimonie, <hi>as the next opinion doth holde.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>For the second is, that</hi> no lay person may bee cited <hi>ex
<pb facs="tcp:19125:85"/>
officio</hi> in any cause, but either restamentarie or matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall: <hi>which if it were true, though a lay man be dùely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented for any crime; yet shall hee neuer bee cited for it, or brought into question, for want of an accuser to prosecute it. Concerning</hi> the citing of laye persons, <hi>absolutely in any cause besides those two, ynough hath beene saide in the former part So that in this opinion</hi> the citing <hi>ex officio onely remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth needefull to bee further spoken of. Truely if the authour of it had vnderstood what he writte, he would neuer haue put it in the tale or reckoning. For of all other causes Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call whatsoeuer, there can be least vse of proceeding</hi> ex offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio <hi>in those two: because the chiefest, and almost onely vse of it is, in dealing against</hi> crimes and offences. <hi>But I wil bring these two opinions into a briefe thus: the first seemeth to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit proceeding of Office in an Ecclesiasticall matter, so there be a solemne</hi> presentment <hi>precedent. The second condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth all proceeding without a partie (sauing in those two cases) and so (in effect) in all causes, if it haue none vse in those two.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The third of those opinions is,</hi> that albeit a matter bee duely presented against a man, yet he may not be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined vpon his oath, as of incontinencie or such like. <hi>Whereby (I thinke) is meant, that hee may not be so exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of any criminall and penall matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The last opinion of the saide foure, is: that</hi> no man is bound to declare any matter against another, except there be some, that is an accuser. <hi>So that by this last, no witnesses shall euer be had, when the Iudge proceedeth</hi> ex of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio, <hi>except themselues list, which commonly none wil thrust himselfe into, but vpon some pique or humor of enmitie. And so an</hi> accuser <hi>who for the most part commeth in of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice shall (by this opinion) haue compulsories to force witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses to testifie: but a magistrate proceeding for satisfaction
<pb facs="tcp:19125:86"/>
of his dutie only, shall not. By the way may be noted, that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by also that opinion is ouerthrowen which holdeth, no man to be bound against his will to testifie, but in causes matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall or testamentary: for</hi> accusation <hi>is onely of offences. By this opinion is implied, that when there is an</hi> accuser, <hi>a man may bee compelled and is bound to declare a trueth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst another. Which last being ioyned to the former, viz.</hi> that albeit a matter be duely presented (that is crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and may be penall to him) yet he may not be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined of it, vpon his owne oath: <hi>doth come to this passe, that of an Ecclesiasticall crime, there is (by lawe) no way to conuict a man, except some man will be an</hi> accuser, <hi>or els by voluntarie witnesses</hi> qui sese ingerunt ad testimonium: <hi>viz. such, whome the very lawe of nations doth entend to be enemies vnto the partie, because they thrust themselues into the matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>You are not to marueile that the opinions of those, who shoote at one generall marke, are so absurd, and do so varie and iarre among themselues, and doe as it were confront one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. For you remember,</hi> quòd vno absurdo dato, multa consequuntur: <hi>and that trueth is simple, constant, and like it selfe, and therefore no trueth is disagreeing from another trueth: whereas vntrueth is manifold, and variable from it selfe. For two contraries can neuer be both true, but they may be, and are oftentimes both of them false.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The first of these opinions then taketh away all proceeding, either in crimes, or in any other causes, where there wanteth an accusation or such solemne presentment, as the author of it meaneth. The second (in effect) taketh away all proceeding</hi> ex officio, <hi>but especially in crimes and offences. The third impugneth all examination by the othe of the partie, in a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter criminall and penall. The last woulde ouerthrowe all vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of witnesses to testifie, in a cause moued</hi> ex officio, <hi>viz.
<pb facs="tcp:19125:86"/>
where there is none</hi> accuser, <hi>yea though there bee a solemne</hi> presentment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>These foure challenges (among others) are also made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall, by the innouators, not onely for contrarietie vnto the lawes of the Realme, but for contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie also to</hi> Canon <hi>lawe, to</hi> Ciuill <hi>lawe, to</hi> Gods <hi>lawe, and vnto reason, as is by them pretended.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But aswell their other exceptions, that of late haue beene taken by any of them, and stirred vp against the maner of exercising iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall, (so farre as I can learne) as also these foure last recited falling in with them (albeit all their said opinions be not holden by euery of them, but according to the varietie of their humors and seuerall ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities) may be reduced (not vnfitly) vnto these two heads.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>They doe respect, either</hi> the manner of entrance into the suite, <hi>or els</hi> the fourme of proceeding in it. <hi>In the</hi> maner of entrance <hi>(you see) they challenge it, for that</hi> it is not either at the suite of some accuser, or vpon a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Presentment: <hi>Or for being</hi> ex officio <hi>in any other cause, then those two of testament, or matrimony, wherein (in very deede) such proceeding hath little or</hi> none <hi>vse.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In the</hi> course of proceeding in the suite, <hi>they take ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, partly against some</hi> principall acte <hi>therein vsed: and partly against some meaner circumstances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In that more principall acte (viz. of giuing an othe) they impugne either</hi> the examination vpon othe of the partie himselfe, <hi>or</hi> the examination of witnesses, concerning their brethrens actions. <hi>Touching</hi> the othe of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <hi>both fault is found by some</hi> with the ceremonie vsed in giuing the othe, <hi>and because</hi> the othe is giuen in a cause criminal and penal to themselues. <hi>In the ceremonie at ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king an oth, there is reprehended (by some)</hi> the laying of the hand on a booke, <hi>and</hi> the swearing by the booke, or by
<pb facs="tcp:19125:87"/>
the contents of it. <hi>Of</hi> meaner circumstances <hi>(falling out in proceeding) that they challenge, some are concurring with the very tender of the oath</hi> (as that they haue not distinct knowledge of euery particular, whereupon they are to be examined, before they resolue, whether to take the othe or not: <hi>and other are</hi> ensuing the othe and exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: <hi>as that</hi> the Iudges doe not rest in that which is affirmed or denied vpon their oth, but oftentimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede to a further examination by witnesses, vpon the same pointes. <hi>All which I mind (God willing) to prosecute, in the same order, that I haue here set foorth: hauing first touched some matters, that I holde not vnnecessary to be knowen by the vnlearned sort, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter opening and vnderstanding of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputations following.</hi>

The <note n="2" place="margin">L. 1. C. de falsa moneta.</note> 
                        <hi>Ciuill</hi> lawes do appoint the very houses to be ouerthrowen where forging of mony hath bene vsed.

                        <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> There in is shewed how there are two sortes of prosecution of Crimes and Offences; <hi>viz.</hi> by a <hi>Partie</hi> and of <hi>Office;</hi> and the practise of them in Scripture, and in the seuerall Courtes of this Realme declared.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow, the meanes to bring any Crime and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence into question before Iudges and Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours in authoritie, must needs be, and so by all lawes, and in all common weales generallie (that I haue read of) are either by prosecution of some partie, or else vpon the <hi>Office</hi> of the Iudge: the <note n="5" place="margin">Iul. Cla. lib. 5. § fin. q. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Office</hi> of the Iudge is occasioned, and as it were set on worke, either vpon relation made vnto him by some other, or vpon his owne meere motion, without any relation from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which may happen, as when an outrage or misdemeanor is committed in his sight, or in some publike presence, where he then happeneth to be.</p>
                     <p>In the law of God and examples of holy Scripture, I do not call to my slender remembrance where any criminall matters be appointed &amp; commanded to be prosecuted by a <hi>Partie:</hi> &amp; but in very few places, where any haue bene vsed, who might proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be termed an <hi>Accuser,</hi> or a <hi>Partie.</hi> For albeit in sundry places of Scripture we finde <hi>Accusers</hi> mentioned; yet in many of them,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19125:91"/>
such cannot be <hi>accusors</hi> or parties (properly and strictly so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) but onely in a very large signification. because their testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies were receiued against those, whom they denounced of crimes. For where a man is partie himselfe, making it as it were his owne cause, and not the Iudges office; there it is no reason, that his owne testimony should be admitted. <note n="1" place="margin">L. 1. §. in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pria. ff. Quando appell.</note> 
                        <hi>Quia testimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um in propria causa vel quasi propria, non valet.</hi> And it may then be said to be a mans owne cause; whereof he may reape benefit or dammage. But more (God willing) shalbe spoken hereof, in his proper place.</p>
                     <p>Touching bringing crimes into question in Temporal Courts of this Realme, (that deale in matters ciuill or criminall) it is to be first remembred, that these Courts be of two sorts: some vsing the <hi>Queenes</hi> immediate auctoritie, yet the same still actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in her Highnes  as all the Courts at <hi>Westminster:</hi> Others vsing but a kinde of mediate auctoritie, deriued from the <hi>Crowne;</hi> yet by her <hi>Graunt</hi> made (in some sort) their owne, as deriued downe thereby vnto them. For sundry subiects, albeit they haue but a deriued power from the <hi>Queene</hi> (as from whome through the dominions of this Crowne, all iustice, and iurisdiction to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minister it, whether <hi>Temporall,</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> doth originally flowe:) yet do not their <hi>Processes</hi> runne in the <hi>Queenes</hi> name, nor her seale is vsed to them.</p>
                     <p>Of such <hi>Temporall</hi> Courts as sit but by such a mediate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued auctoritie from the <hi>Queene</hi> vnto them, and therefore vse not her Seale or name; some were in times past established for causes <hi>Martiall,</hi> as the <note n="2" place="margin">Ric. 2. cap.</note> 
                        <hi>Constables</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and the Earle <hi>Marshall</hi> his Courts (whereof I haue very small experience:) and some for matters perteyning to the <hi>Peace.</hi> And of these last, some be for <hi>causes</hi> growing within the land, as Courts of <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Palantine,</hi> of cities and townes <hi>corporate,</hi> Sherifs turnes, and Court-Leets, or views of <hi>Francke-pledge:</hi> and others be for causes <hi>Marine,</hi> as all the Courts of the <hi>Admiraltie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In temporal courts of counties <hi>Palantine,</hi> in courts of townes and cities corporate, fauing where some speciall custome preuai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth (as in <hi>London</hi> many) in Sherifs turnes and in Leetes, the course of the common Lawe is (for the most part) obserued. In <hi>Admiral courts,</hi> the order of the <hi>Ciuill lawe</hi> of the <hi>Romanes</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:19125:92"/>
it is the written Common law of most nations not barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, with whom wee haue to deale) is especially vsed; sauing where by <hi>Statute</hi> or <hi>Custome,</hi> it is otherwise directed.</p>
                     <p>Of such courts as exercise the Queenes immediate autoritie, some haue no letters Patents of Commission to direct them; as the <hi>Parlement,</hi> which is called, and sitteth by the <hi>Queenes</hi> onely writ: the <hi>Chauncerie,</hi> from whence all originall writs do come; and yet the L. <hi>Chauncellour</hi> or L. <hi>Keeper</hi> haue no Commission by letters Patents, but receiue their authority by deliuery vnto them of the <hi>great Seale,</hi> as I am infourmed: the <hi>Starre-Chamber</hi> (esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished of the Queenes priuie Counsell, and some others to be called) partly by <hi>praescription,</hi> and partly by <hi>Statute:</hi> the court of <hi>Requests</hi> by <hi>custome</hi> and <hi>praescription:</hi> And the Counsaile in the Principalitie and <hi>Marches</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> auctorised by <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> vnto such, and in such maner, as her Maiestie (by instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vnder her Roial hand-writing) shal from time to time direct.</p>
                     <p>But those Courtes <hi>Temporall,</hi> which sit by Commission and letters Patents for exercising (in stead of her Highnesse) the Queenes owne and immediate autoritie, are either such, as be vsually now holden at <hi>Westminster,</hi> as the Courts of the <hi>Queens Bench,</hi> the <hi>common Pleas,</hi> the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and the Court of <hi>Wards</hi> and <hi>Liueries:</hi> or in other places of the Realme abroad, as Courts of <hi>Generall Assises, Nisipriùs, Gaole deliuerie, Sessions of the Peace,</hi> the Counsell established in the North parts, the Court of <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery</hi> in <hi>Deuonshire</hi> and <hi>Cornewall,</hi> and (as I haue bene infourmed) the Court for triall of life and death at <hi>Halisax,</hi> and such like.</p>
                     <p>I know, that by speach, and by vse also (in sundry mens wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings) touching the aforenamed Courts; such only (as it were by a kinde of appropriation) be most vsually called Courts of the <hi>Common lawe,</hi> wherein matters of <hi>fact,</hi> touching <hi>hereditaments, contracts,</hi> or <hi>misdemeanours</hi> be tried by a Iurie of twelue men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this triall is more frequent then any other. But yet we are not to thinke, that none but these may truely so be named, as though the other were contrary to the Lawe Common; seeing they be also allowed by the <hi>Lawes, Statutes,</hi> or <hi>Customes</hi> of this Realme, aswell as those which proceede to triall by Iuries.</p>
                     <p>In the Courts afore specified that proceede to the triall of crimes, by Iuries of twelue; if there be any <hi>Appellour,</hi> as of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,

robberie, or such like; then may the <hi>prosecution</hi> most properly and truely be said to be done by an <hi>Accuser,</hi> and at the <hi>prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a partie.</hi> If it be for the <hi>Queene,</hi> whether it be by way of <hi>enditemen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                           </gap>:</hi> And this, either of meere and <hi>entire office,</hi> as when the Iudge himselfe preferreth it; or <hi>ex officio promoto,</hi> as when it is first related and preferred vp vnto him, and prosecuted by any other. But in this last case, there is a kinde of <hi>mixt</hi> proceeding betwixt both. And albeit the Informer do prosecute partly for himselfe; yet is it for the <hi>Queene</hi> also whose the Court is, and so may be truly said to be <hi>of office.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This appeareth plainely, in that the <hi>Appeller</hi> (because he Is a meere partie) is not so fauoured, assisted, and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>iuileged in many respects; as when the <hi>prosecution</hi> is instituted <hi>of Office</hi> for the <hi>Queene.</hi> For the <hi>Appellee</hi> may put it to triall of battell with the <hi>Appellour,</hi> which he cannot doe vpon <hi>enditement;</hi> at the suite of the <hi>Queene.</hi> Like wise, whosoeuer doth preferre <hi>the endi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>ement;</hi> or <hi>information,</hi> though the defendant happen to be acquited: yet the preferrer payeth neither costs, nor dammages, nor is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to any action in that behalfe, as an <hi>Accuser</hi> and partie both is, and ought to be. But if the defendant be conuicted (so the crime be not <hi>capitall,</hi> but <hi>fineable:)</hi> then is the <hi>fine,</hi> if it be impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Court, to come wholly to the Queene: If by <hi>poen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now these and such like; be notes and markes; whereby you may discerne proceedings of these Courtes in <hi>criminall</hi> causes prosecuted by an <hi>Accusour</hi> or <hi>partie,</hi> from that which is done vpon the <hi>office</hi> of the Court: for these two prosecutions doe dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the end; and they differ also in certeine priuileged points, which that <hi>of Office</hi> hath, aboue that which is by a <hi>partie.</hi> In the end, thus they differ; because prosecution <hi>of Office</hi> aimeth at
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19125:93"/>
                        <hi>publicam vindictam,</hi> a publique punishment, whether <hi>pecunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> to acerue to the Queene, or <hi>corporall.</hi> In deed, in all <hi>capitall</hi> causes, <hi>vindicta</hi> is (in truth) <hi>publique,</hi> and <hi>exemplarie,</hi> albeit both the <hi>Appellour,</hi> onely doe prosecute (perhaps after the Queene haue pardoned it) and that he also seeke nothing els, but priuate reuenge for his owne iniurie receiued rather then for an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to be made of the offender, or for the Common weales satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and contentment. Of the contrary side, prosecution in these Courtes of an offence criminall (being not capitall) by an <hi>Accuser</hi> or <hi>partie,</hi> propoundeth (for the most part) but a <hi>Ciuill end,</hi> that is, some satisfaction and amends to be made vnto the complainant damaged: as in actions of sundry trespasses, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the case &amp;c. And then doe the <hi>Ciuilians</hi> terme this <hi>Causa criminalis ciuiliter;</hi> and the former, <hi>Causa criminalis cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaliter mota.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Besides such difference in the end, there be also some priuile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that are granted to the one course of proceeding, which are denied to the other; whereby those two kindes of prosecution doe differ. As that in proceeding of <hi>Office</hi> for the Queene (as was touched afore) the defendant may not gage battell against the preferrer, as he may doe against the <hi>Appellour:</hi> neither hath any defendant in an <hi>enditement</hi> or <hi>information</hi> (though he be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quited) any costs allowed, when the suite is for the Queene, as he both hath and ought (in iustice) to haue, when the suite a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, is onely prosecuted by a priuate and wrongfull <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser;</hi> that was not able to iustifie his declaration (as wee may terme it) <hi>accusatorie,</hi> of such priuate offence or misdemeanour, whereupon he sued him.</p>
                     <p>Now let vs consider also how those Courtes which haue none vsuall triall by <hi>Iuries,</hi> doe proceed against offences. First the high Court of <hi>Parliament</hi> hath no great vse (that I know) of dealing against <hi>Offences:</hi> but such as happen to be committed either by some member of the house, during the time of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> or against the liberties and orders of that Court. In both which cases they proceed to examination of them, either vpon the <hi>Notoriety of the fact</hi> happening among them, or vpon cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible <hi>relation</hi> of some; but wholly without any <hi>Accuser</hi> or <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> taking vpon him the proofe thereof, with any hazzard, of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:19125:93"/>
so much as Charges for wrongfull vexation; if it should so fall out to be accounted. And therefore such proceeding, is also of meere <hi>Office.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Starre Chamber,</hi> onely crimes and misdemeanours bee inquired of; but especially those, which I called afore <hi>Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naria Crimina:</hi> viz. such as haue either no certaine name, or at least no set and determinate punishment, by Lawe appointed; and may not be punished there, by losse of life or of limme; but either by <hi>Fine,</hi> by open shame and infamie, by imprisonment, by nayling or cutting of eares, or deforming the face, by banishing from some certaine place of the Realme, or foorth of all the Queenes dominions, or vnto a certaine place abroad; or by condemnation vnto the <hi>Galleis</hi> perpetually, or for a time, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The misdemeanours punishable in the <hi>Starre Chamber,</hi> bee brought thither into question for the Queene onely, either by her Maiesties <hi>Atturney generall</hi> (and that is by bill of informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or <hi>Ore tenus)</hi> or els be brought vpon bill preferred by some priuate person, that is grieued. In all which Cases, albeit there be found one which doth prosecute: yet can he not truely be called an <hi>Accusour,</hi> or a partie; for the reasons before alleaged, viz. of the end propounded, which is <hi>publica vindicta;</hi> and for other great assistance and priuiledge, which that Court giueth to the prosecutor against the def. in respect that it is for the Queene.</p>
                     <p>And namelie that he is to answere not onely to the <hi>Bill</hi> vpon his oath, but also to <hi>Interrogatories</hi> more particularly criminall then the Bill, and the <hi>Interrogatories</hi> without counsell: which (in trueth) therefore needeth not, because they are brieflie drawen article-wise, and concerne but matters of fact, within his owne knowledge as is entended. Vpon all which matter it followeth, that the prosecutour there is but as a relatour, partly to stirre vp, and partly to ease <hi>the office</hi> of that Court, by furnishing it with proofes.</p>
                     <p>Neuerthelesse I am not ignorant, that sometimes, when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth manifestlie to their Lordships: that the plaintife (being some priuate person) hath calumniously, and of malice onely, vexed the def. then such plaintife there, is (and iustly also may be) condemned in costes and damages, for his apparant calumnia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and wrongfull molestation of the def. Vnto which courses
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19125:94"/>
of the <hi>Starre Chamber,</hi> I take the Courts of the Queenes Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell established in the <hi>Marches</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> and in the <hi>North partes,</hi> to bee also agreeable in their inquiries and examinations of crimes and misdemeanors.</p>
                     <p>In the <hi>Chancerie</hi> and Court of <hi>Requests,</hi> (being both Courtes of equitie) if any misdemeanours or crimes be diduced and laied downe in the Bils (which happeneth very often:) yet are they not <hi>Criminallie</hi> laid, to haue the def. punished for them: but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Ciuilly,</hi> to the intent, that the plaintife may haue an amends and priuate satisfaction, as shall be deemed to bee equitie. And therefore such prosecution, is not by <hi>Office</hi> of the Court; but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at the parties suite: albeit the <hi>Office</hi> in the <hi>Chancerie</hi> doe thus farre assist the plaintife, for sifting out of a trueth; that the def. must answere, euen to the <hi>Criminall</hi> points of the Bill, vpon his corporall oath: But he may not (in those two Courts) be put to answere the plaintifes interrogatories vpon his oath; except the plaintife will be concluded by the def. answere vnto them, and seeke to make no further proofes.</p>
                     <p>But of all the Courts temporall aforesaid, aswell those which proceed to the triall of misdemeanours by <hi>Iurie,</hi> as of others; I thinke this may bee generally affirmed; That when any lewde practice, abuse, or contempt (not capitall, not tending to muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation) is supposed to be done against the Court; there (euen of meere <hi>Office</hi> without any <hi>Accusation</hi> or prosecution of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie by Bill) the Iudges of such Courts, doe <hi>Enquire</hi> thereof, by examining and by interrogating euery one that is holden suspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted thereof, or to be priuie thereto, vpon their corporall oathes first taken. Let thus much then suffice for the two sortes of prosecution, and bringing Crimes into question, by the course mentioned in <hi>Scripture;</hi> and by vse and practice in Temporall courts of this Realme.</p>

III.</hi> Of the sundry kindes of obiecting Crimes by a <hi>partie</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Ciuill</hi> lawe: as by reason of a mans publique charge and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: also by way of <hi>Exception, Supplication, Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> and <hi>Accusation.</hi> The true signification of the worde <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusatio,</hi> his diuers acceptions, definition, and exposition thereof, with some reason of the frequencie of <hi>Accusatio</hi> in Courtes of the <hi>Ciuill</hi> lawes, in former times is also declared.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He same, and none other maner is likewise pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised to bring offences into question by the lawes both Ciuill and Ecclesiasticall, in such Courtes, as either of those Lawes haue place and vse: That is to say, either by a <hi>partie,</hi> or els by the <hi>Office</hi> of the Iudge.</p>
                     <p>Crimes in such Courtes may be brought into question be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Iudge, vpon a parties prosecution (whereof we are first to speake) two maner of wayes. The one <hi>Commendablie,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not so <hi>commendablie. Commendablie</hi> in two sortes, either by reason of some office and charge, or by reason of a mans owne necessary interest. By reason of a mans <hi>Office</hi> and due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, as when <hi>Triumuiri regij, Procuratores Fisci, Aduocati regij</hi> (as French writers call them) or (as we speake and practise here in <hi>England)</hi> when the Queenes <hi>Atturney generall</hi> (who by due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is bound thereunto) preferreth <hi>inditement</hi> or <hi>information</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst some suspected criminous person, or wrong doer. This hath verie neere affinitie with that <hi>Denunciation</hi> or <hi>Presentment</hi> (called <hi>Iudiciall)</hi> which is to be spoken of hereafter. And albeit there be a kinde of <hi>partie;</hi> yet it is of the nature of proceeding of <hi>Office,</hi> which I also touched in the Chapter next precedent.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Commendable</hi> prosecution by a <hi>partie</hi> against an <hi>Offence,</hi> in respect of a mans owne priuate interest; is either by way of <hi>Exception</hi> and chalenge, done in his owne necessarie defence, and to auoide punishment; or <hi>per viam querelae,</hi> by way of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint</hi> for attayning his right.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Exception</hi> is sometimes taken against witnesses that be brought against vs, to this intent onely; that by obiecting and proouing them to be lewde or affectionate persons, there may no credite
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:19125:95"/>
be giuen to them in their depositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s; and not to haue them puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed. And this obiecting of Crimes by way of <hi>Exception,</hi> hath not y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> force of an <hi>Accusation.</hi> Or els <note n="1" place="margin">l. 1. ff. vi. bon. rapt. l. 2. ff. de tab. exhib.</note> it is taken (before issue ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) <hi>against him that would accuse vs, by our obiecting of some crime also vnto him.</hi> Now if this be done onely to the end to repel him from accusing; then hath it not the effect of an <hi>Accusation,</hi> whereby he may be punished (though he be proued guiltie.) But if he that so <hi>excepteth,</hi> doe set downe the time, place, &amp;c. of such crime obiected against his aduersarie, and doe also instant the Iudge to condemne him: then shall it be proceeded in, as in <hi>Accusation,</hi> and may be called a <hi>Recrimination,</hi> or <hi>Crosse-accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> made by the defendant.</p>
                     <p>The prosecution <hi>per Querelam,</hi> is also of two sortes: the one <hi>extraiudiciall, when</hi> 
                        <note n="2" place="margin">l. 1 C. Retum amotatum.</note> 
                        <hi>a man oppressed, humbly and ciuillie complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and expostulateth of some wrong done vnto him, desiring reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, not so much to haue the other punished, as that himselfe may, (by ordinarie course of lawe) haue reason done him.</hi> This may properly be called <hi>Querimonia,</hi> a supplication to the Superior. The other <hi>Querela,</hi> is <hi>Iudiciall,</hi> being a kinde of <hi>Appellation;</hi> 
                        <note n="3" place="margin">l. Arbitrio. vbi gloss. &amp; Bart. ff. qui satisdare co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntur,</note> and is either done by complaint vnto the soueraigne Prince, of some wrong done by an high Court (such as <hi>Praefectus Praetorio</hi> kept among the <hi>Romanes)</hi> from which none <hi>Appellation</hi> lieth: or els is a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint</hi> vnto a superiour Iudge, of refusall, or delay to do iustice, by his inferiour Iudge; with vs commonly termed a <hi>double Querele.</hi> Thus much for the most commendable sortes of prosecution of offences, instituted by a partie.</p>
                     <p>Of those which be not so commendable prosecutions of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences by parties, one is called <hi>Delatio,</hi> being the more odious and base; the other is <hi>Accusatio,</hi> properly so termed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Delatio</hi> like wise is of two sorts. The one may be described to be a <note n="4" place="margin">l. 10. §. Qui nomen. ff. de iure patr.</note> secret accusation or imputation of some crime against any, made vnto a Magistrate, by him that is no way particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teressed in the cause. Against such, was that law <note n="5" place="margin">l. pen. C. de De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latorib. lib. 10.</note> of <hi>Constantinus</hi> conceiued, whereby it was prouided, <hi>that no priuate person should be a delatour, or preferrer vp of crimes;</hi> and <hi>that none should be put vp, without the Aduocate of the finances, or reuenues of the crowne;</hi> whom we call the <hi>Atturney generall.</hi> And of such <hi>Delatours</hi> or <hi>Tale-carriers</hi> was this woorthy saying of an Emperour meant:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19125:95"/>
                        <hi>Princeps, qui delatores non castigat, irritat. Priuy accusers &amp; back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters take encouragement enough from such a Prince, as will but heare, without giuing them any rebuke.</hi> Which saying, <hi>Suetonius</hi> 
                        <note n="1" place="margin">Sueto. in Domit.</note> attributeth to <hi>Domitian;</hi> and <hi>Plinius</hi> 
                        <note n="2" place="margin">Plin. in Panegy. de Traiano.</note> vnto <hi>Traian.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is a second sort of <hi>Delatours</hi> &amp; preferrers vp of crimes, which deale more openly then the former. And we finde also in law, two kindes of these. The first be a kinde of <hi>Calumniatours</hi> or <hi>Sycophants,</hi> 
                        <note n="3" place="margin">l. nostris C. de Calumniator.</note> that <hi>preferre publikely (yet vnder other mens names and persons by them suborned and excited) some criminall matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any person.</hi> The other sort be those, who (for gaine or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) do in their owne names, preferre vp criminall and poenall matter against others. And of these, some doe informe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiled landes or goods; due and escheated to the common trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Crowne; yet supposed to be deteyned wronfully, by any others. And these by the <hi>Ciuill</hi> lawe <note n="4" place="margin">l. ex varia C. de Delatorib. lib. x.</note> are <hi>said to be odious and hated of other men;</hi> because they doe it for no duetie to the Prince or common weale; but vpon a greedie desire, to enioye to them selues, part of the gaine by others losse: being (by that law) some time a third, and sometimes a halfe part of that, which they finde (in trueth) to haue bin deteined by wrong, intruded vpon, or vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Others be mentioned there also, who preferre informations against offenders of such lawes, as do inflict mulctes &amp; pecunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie penalties for the offence; vpon hope of such gaine, as (by those lawes) is assigned to come vnto their share. This kind of <hi>Delators</hi> in this Realme, we call <hi>Infourmers,</hi> or <hi>Promoters:</hi> though their prosecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in this Realme do much participate (as afore is shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) with that, which is called <hi>ex Officio promoto,</hi> &amp; in that respect, be greatly priuiledged. Among the <hi>Romanes</hi> such were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Quadruplatores,</hi> because commonly the <hi>fourth part</hi> of the penaltie, was awarded vnto them. So that by like reason our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmers</hi> may be called in Latine <hi>Triplatores,</hi> when they haue a third part; and <hi>Duplatores,</hi> when they haue the one halfe, as they haue in this Realme (vpon penall statutes) most vsually.</p>
                     <p>In what detestation and hatred this kinde of men (though not altogether vnnecessarie) were had amongs the old <hi>Romanes,</hi> this saying of <hi>Quintilian</hi> doth manifest, <note n="5" place="margin">Quintil. lib. vlti. cap. 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Ad deferendos reospraemio duci, proximum est latrocinio. To be induced for reward or gaine, to preferre criminall matter against offenders, is next a kin to robberie.</hi>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:19125:96"/>
And in deede, <hi>Delatours</hi> were farre more stomacked, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligned, then other <hi>Accusours,</hi> as may bee gathered by these places in the Ciuill lawe. <note n="1" place="margin">l. 3. C. de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefic.</note> 
                        <hi>Wee doe iudge him that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth in such a crime, to deserue rather rewarde, then to bee called a Delatour.</hi> And againe in another place: <note n="2" place="margin">l. Nulli. in fine, C. de. Epis. &amp; Cleric.</note> 
                        <hi>Let not such feare either the name or suspicion of Delatours.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The last of those wayes, by which a <hi>partie</hi> brings offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into question and discussing before a Iudge, is <hi>Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> It is called <note n="3" place="margin">Isidor. vt in c. forus. de verb. signif.</note> 
                        <hi>Accusatio ab Ad, &amp; Caussa: quia Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor quasi ad causam vocat.</hi> There bee other wordes of neere signification vnto this, yet not the same altogether, as <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulare,</hi> when it is vsed with the ablatiue case, <hi>Postulare aliquem crimine, insimulare, incusare,</hi> and such like. But there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence noted betwixt this last, and <hi>Accusation,</hi> which is this: <hi>We are saide (saieth</hi> 
                        <note n="4" place="margin">Servius in prim. Aeneid.</note> 
                        <hi>one) properly incusare, such as bee our bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and to accuse those, that be our equals or inferiours.</hi> But this difference is not much obserued. <note n="5" place="margin">l. Qui accusare, C. de edendo. l. Si maritus. § Si negauer. ff. de adulter.</note> This worde <hi>Accusation</hi> is sometimes so generally taken, that it signifieth an <hi>Action</hi> in a Ciuill cause; like as, on the contrary side, <hi>Action</hi> is taken for <hi>Accusation. Tullie, pro Milone</hi> nameth it <hi>Actionem Perduellionis.</hi> But most properly it is called <hi>Accusation,</hi> when it is intended in causes <hi>Criminall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>We reade of <hi>inwarde,</hi> and of <hi>externall, or outwarde Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Internall Accusation</hi> is of a mans owne conscience. Such is the <hi>Accusation</hi> spoken of by <hi>Salomon.</hi>

                        <hi>Externall,</hi> or outward <hi>Accusation</hi> is either <hi>Priuate,</hi> or <hi>Publike. Priuate</hi> is either betwixt enemies, or betwixt friendes. That <hi>priuate Accusation</hi> and imputation which is among enemies, is of three sortes: either spitefull vpbraiding, called of the <hi>Grecians</hi> by the generall name <note n="7" place="margin">Plutarch in vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta Publicol.</note> of <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Priuate <hi>Accusation</hi> of one friend touching another, is nothing els, but a friendly <hi>expostulation</hi> with him, that is supposed not to haue dealt singlie or considerately, in the course of good friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,

                        </gap> of the <hi>Grecians.</hi> That <hi>Accusation</hi> which is <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,</hi> is either <hi>ciuillie</hi> moued, that is, for priuate amends vnto the partie grieued: or <hi>criminallie,</hi> that is, for some publike punishment; whether it be <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>This <hi>publike Accusation,</hi> is sometimes done <hi>ore tenus;</hi> that is <hi>by bare wordes without writing,</hi> which the <hi>Grecians</hi> doe expresse also by the aforesaide name of <gap reason="foreign">

So in sundry statutes of this Realme, as namely in these wordes of a statute; viz. <hi>duely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused or detected by two lawfull witnesses:</hi> 25. Hen. 8. cap. 14. and in such other statutes; whereby is required, that the <hi>Accusours</hi> be brought face to face, against the prisoner: meaning thereby such witnesses as are to giue euidence (vpon their oathes) against the partie conuented. Hereof we haue diuers examples, and namely in these wordes of a statute, <note n="3" place="margin">1. Ed. 6. ca. 12. in fine.</note> 
                        <hi>That no person shalbe conuicted</hi> &amp;c. <hi>or suffer</hi> &amp;c. <hi>vnlesse the same offendour</hi> &amp;c. <hi>be accused by two sufficient &amp; lawfull witnesses, as shal willingly without violence co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse the same.</hi>
                        <pb n="18" facs="tcp:19125:97"/>
Where the witnesses sayings are called <hi>Accusation,</hi> &amp; their <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, Confession.</hi> Likewise in the same Kings dayes, where it is thus prouided, <note n="1" place="margin">5. &amp; 6. Edw. 6. cap. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>That no person shalbe convicted &amp;c. for any trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons &amp;c. that nowe be, or hereafter shalbe &amp;c. vnlesse the same of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendour be thereof accused by two lawfull accusers: which saide accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers at the time of the arraignment of the partie accused (if they be then liuing) shalbe brought in person before the partie so accused, and auowe and mainteyne that, that they haue to say against the partie, to proue him guiltie of the Treasons or Offences, conteyned in the Bill of inditement.</hi> So that here, those that giue euidence to prooue the matter of the enditement (which must needes be the witnesses) are called <hi>Accusers.</hi> which termein these &amp; like statutes, seemeth to haue bin borrowed from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon speach of men (who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vse to say thus; <hi>Who is able to accuse me of such or such things?</hi> meaning, to testifie against them) rather then that the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietie of the worde was there followed. For <hi>Iustice Brooke</hi> in his Abridgement testifieth, <note n="2" place="margin">Tit. Corone. nu. 220.</note> 
                        <hi>That the common triall at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lawe is by Iurie and witnesses, and not by Accusers.</hi> So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit <hi>witnesses</hi> touching offences (by some statutes and by vsuall speeche of the vulgar sort) be termed <hi>Accusers:</hi> yet (by his opinion) they doe (in very deede) differ much, in that the one is (as he saith) the triall of the Common lawe, but not the other. The true difference betwixt them he there prooueth also out of the Ciuill lawe; vpon relation made vnto him, by a Doctour in that facultie; and willeth it to be noted as a saying, which hee well alloweth. <hi>By the Ciuill lawe</hi> (sayeth <note n="3" place="margin">Brooke. ibid.</note> he) <hi>Accusers be as parties, and not as witnesses. For witnesses ought to bee indifferent, and not to come till they be called. But accusers doe offer themselues to accuse. For it is a good chalenge of a witnesse to say; that hee was one of his accusers. Quod nota.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nowe howe vnreasonable were it, to admitte the testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of a partie in his owne cause? So that by the Ciuill lawe (by which this prosecution is most properly handled,) <hi>Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation</hi> (truely so called) is defined to bee, <hi>Ius vlciscendi so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenni &amp; poenali iudicio, poenas ac delicta: A right which the lawe yeeldeth to any of prosecuting crimes and offences for reuenge and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, by publique and solemne iudgement.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the explaning wherof, we haue to note in this behalfe that

Thirdly, that when it was in most fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent vse, the people were heathen, and vninstructed in the true knowledge of God: so that they thought, to put vp an iniurie done either to themselues, or to their friendes, to be great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sillanimitie, and a token of a base minded man; and to be (in deede) a vice very discommendable, euen as the contrary vice thereunto is; viz. of doing Iniurie.

els some way <hi>mixt,</hi> partly of that proceeding, and partly of prosecutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by a <hi>Partie,</hi> who is not properly to be termed an <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First in this kingdom how rarely <hi>Appeales</hi> be brought and prosecuted against any supposed offenders, sauing murderers, &amp; those scarse two in an age, euery one but of meane experience knoweth. I doe call to mind one <hi>Appeale</hi> of robberie brought by <hi>Benet Smith</hi> against <hi>Giles Rufford</hi> in the beginning of Queene <hi>Maries</hi> raigne; as appeareth by the preamble of a Statute, 2 <hi>&amp;</hi> 3. <hi>Phil. &amp; Mariae, c.</hi> 17. And this kind of prosecution of Crimes, though of all those which we haue, it resemble neerest the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation</hi> practised amongst the olde <hi>Romanes</hi> and others: yet in some points it doeth also somewhat differ from it.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>Flanders</hi> all <hi>Accusation</hi> is altogether inhibited. In the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Naples</hi> it is onely permitted <note n="1" place="margin">Clarus. q. 10.</note> vnto those, which in that sort will prosecute some iniurie or enormitie, done vpon them or theirs. In the <note n="2" place="margin">Decianus.</note> 
                        <hi>Venetian</hi> common weale, it is wholie forbidden vnto priuate persons to <hi>Accuse:</hi> so that the care of prosecuting offences, is wholie left to the publike magistrate. <hi>In France none but the kings generall Atturneis</hi> (whereof there be three) <hi>may take vpon him</hi>

                        <hi>to be an Accuser:</hi> and yet those not properly so to bee called. And this reason is alleaged by a learned writer in Law, of that nation: <hi>Least too great opportunitie of calumniation and of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing the meanest by the power of the mightie, should there by be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen; and for retaining of publike tranquillitie in the kingdome.</hi> It is testified by a graue &amp; learned <hi>Ciuilian</hi> writer, <note n="4" place="margin">Clarus li. 5. §. fin. q. 11.</note> that the solemne maner of <hi>Accusation</hi> mentioned in the <hi>Ciuill</hi> law of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> is almost generally now growen in disuse.</p>
                     <p>The chiefest causes of such disuse thereof (as I doe conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture) hath growen by these two wayes. The first, because it is so full of danger and trouble: The second, because it is and hath bene so odious and abhorred of most men in all ages. The danger and trouble may be considered at the beginning of the fuite: in the course of prosecuting it; and vpon the euent which may ensue of it.</p>

The second is, when he doeth <hi>Tergiuersari,</hi> that is, <hi>giue ouer and desist from his prosecution, vpon corruption, &amp;c.</hi> The last is, when hee doeth <hi>Calumniari,</hi> that is, <hi>wilfully</hi>

This course was so hatefull, that oftentimes such as pursued it, were vpbraided with it as odious. For <hi>Mamercus Scaurus</hi> 
                        <note n="1" place="margin">Tacitus. l. 3.

                     </p>
                     <p>And not onely these Heathen men, but the <hi>Fathers of</hi> the Church, had it also in like detestation, that a man by <hi>Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> should be so carefull to bring other men into danger; which <note n="3" place="margin">August. li. 1. confess. cap. 18.</note> 
                        <hi>S. Augustine</hi> therefore among others greatly reprehendeth. And he saith in another place thus: <note n="4" place="margin">August. in Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mone Domini in monte.</note> 
                        <hi>All matters, wherein we suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any indignitie, are of two sorts: The one is such as cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored; the other which may be. Now for that which cannot be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, we seeke some comfort by taking reuenge. But (alas) what doth it auaile thee, if thou being smitten doest smite againe, or that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe it, to reuenge thy quarrell? Will that hurt which is in thy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, be thereby healed? Which seeing it cannot be truely said, it must needes be, that all these reuengements proceed but from an haughtie and a proud heart.</hi> In this regard, <note n="5" place="margin">c. Si quis episc. 2. q. 7.</note> olde <hi>Canons</hi> do call <hi>Accusation, Genus illaudabilis intentionis, a kinde of discommendable endeuour or sute.</hi> The reason whereof is, for that it is done (for the most part) vpon a reuengefull and wrathfull minde, whatsoeuer be pretended otherwise. <hi>If a man to excuse this, shall thinke that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he pleaseth God,</hi>

                     <p>Hereupon, and perhaps also vpon occasion of certaine pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Scripture,</hi> some may gather that the course of <hi>Accusation</hi>
                        <pb n="28" facs="tcp:19125:102"/>
is altogether vnlawfull to be vsed by any Christian. In deed, thus it is written in <hi>Leuiticus:</hi> 
                        <note n="1" place="margin">Leu. cap. 19. <abbr>V.</abbr> 16.</note> 
                        <hi>Thou shalt not stand against the bloud of thy neighbour; I am the Lord. And a little after:</hi>

                        <hi>Thou shalt not auenge, nor be mindefull of wrong against the children of thy people, but shalt loue thy neighbour as thy selfe; I am the Lorde.</hi> Likewise <hi>Iesus</hi> the sonne of <hi>Syrach</hi> sayth: <note n="3" place="margin">Ecclesiasticus cap. 10. <abbr>V.</abbr> 6.</note> 
                        <hi>Be not angry for any wrong with thy neighbour, and doe nothing by iniurious practises.</hi> In the Gospell wee are thus commanded: <note n="4" place="margin">Matth. 5. <abbr>V.</abbr> 38 &amp; 39.</note> 
                        <hi>Ye haue heard, that it hath bene sayd; an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth. But I say vnto you, resist not euill; but whosoeuer shall smite thee on thy right cheeke, turne to him the other also.</hi> Againe, <note n="5" place="margin">Vers. 44. ibid.</note> 
                        <hi>Loue your enemies; blesse them that curse you; doe good to them that hate you, and pray for them which hurt you, and persecute you.</hi> Which commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are also repeated by <note n="6" place="margin">Luke cap. 6. <abbr>V.</abbr> 27. &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>S. Luke.</hi> And to like purpose <note n="7" place="margin">1. Cor. 6. <abbr>V.</abbr> 7.</note> sayth <hi>S. Paul: There is vtterly a fault among you, because ye goe to law one with another. Why rather suffer ye not wrong? why rather susteine ye not losse?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Truely it may not be denied, but that the pregnancie of these places is such, that all prosecution of priuate iniuries or crimes, done vpon reuenge, malice, enuie, vaine-glorie, gaine, or any such like particular respect alone, is heereby condemned. For in <hi>Accusation</hi> it is first required, that a reuengefull minde be wanting, which is presumed to be present, when the iniurie pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted is but priuate, and such as is not subiect to restitution, according to the former distinction repeated out of <hi>S. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine.</hi> Secondly, it must be done vpon a good zeale; to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent the offender may be amended, and others not hurt, by the euill example. <hi>For by those</hi> 
                        <note n="8" place="margin">August. in ser. Domini in mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te.</note> 
                        <hi>wordes of the Gospell, such punishment of sinne, as tendeth to correction, is not forbidden; because that is a part of mercie,</hi> sayth <hi>S. Augustine. And</hi> (sayth hee) <note n="9" place="margin">August. ibid.</note> 
                        <hi>holy men haue punished certeine sinnes euen with death, both to strike a profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table feare into the liuing, and that the death it selfe might not hurt them, who were punished by it, but the sinne diminished, which was like rather to be encreased in them, if they shoulde haue liued longer.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Accusation</hi> by a <hi>Christian</hi> ought to be referred onely to the publike benefit of the Common weale. In this behalfe <hi>Plato</hi> (being but an heathen Philosopher) hath a very seuere saying. <note n="10" place="margin">Plato in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyph.</note> 
                        <hi>It is an holy thing</hi> (sayth hee) <hi>to draw them into iudgement, that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19125:102"/>
haue committed any murther or sacrilege, whether it be thy father, mother, or any other whosoeuer, that hath so offended: so it be done for this end, to ridde the Common weale of them, as of a contagious plague vnto it.</hi> Lastly, <hi>Accusation</hi> may not be vsed for gaine and lucres sake. For such <hi>Accusers</hi> especially are odious to all men. Another heathen writer could say thus heereof: <note n="1" place="margin">Quintil. siue Tacitus de claris Orator.</note> 
                        <hi>The vse of this gainefull and bloudie eloquence, is sprung vp of late times by corrupt custome; and was deuised</hi> (as one <hi>Aper</hi> was woont to say) <hi>but instead of a iaueline or dart to thrust men thorow with: In locum teli repertus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that if men could keepe themselues strictly within these former boundes; then prosecution by <hi>Accusation</hi> would neither be so perilous to the <hi>Accuser,</hi> nor yet so hurtfull vnto others, but that it might still haue a tollerable and profitable vse in <hi>Christian</hi> Common weales. And then, that which <hi>Tullie</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, might haue place, where hee sayth; that <note n="2" place="margin">Pro S. Roscio Amer.</note> 
                        <hi>it is profitable to haue many Accusers in a Common weale; yet so, as that men be not abused by such Accusations.</hi> And thus much for <hi>prosecution of crimes by a partie.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>It is here to be remembred, that in the common wealth of <hi>Rome,</hi> before the people had conueied ouer, and graunted away all their power and authoritie vnto the <hi>Emperour;</hi> they had in
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19125:104"/>
themselues soueraigne authoritie aswell of punishing heinous crimes, as al other matters of importance. Crimes which be more heinous, were called <hi>publica crimina,</hi> crimes against the state: and the other, <hi>priuata delicta,</hi> priuate offences, being of lesse impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and done but to priuate persons dammage. The punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for some of the <hi>publike crimes,</hi> the people reserued to them selues onely: but some other of them were first put ouer vnto certaine <hi>Officers</hi> purposely thereunto appointed, called <hi>Quaesto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res siue Quesitores Parricidij;</hi> because they dealt in them (for the most part) of <hi>Office</hi> by way of <hi>Enquirie.</hi> Yet their dealing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was called <hi>Ordinaria cognitio &amp; ordinaria Quaestio:</hi> And the crimes which they enquired of, <hi>Ordinaria crimina,</hi> vpon the same occasion.</p>
                     <p>In the sixe hundred and fifth yeere from the first foundation of that Citie, it was ordeyned, that out of <note n="1" place="margin">Tullie in Bruto &amp; pro Cluentio.</note> the sixe <hi>Praetours</hi> for the time being, foure shoulde continually after bee cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen to bee <hi>Quaesitores</hi> of so many crimes allotted vnto their seuerall hearing and determining: and therevpon those <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries</hi> were called not onely <hi>Ordinariae,</hi> but also <hi>Quaestiones perpetuae;</hi> perpetuall and <hi>Ordinarie Enquiries</hi> of such crimes, as were so committed ouer by the people. Vnto which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <hi>Sylla</hi> in his <hi>Dictatorshippe</hi> added three other kindes of crimes: and so there became (in all) seuen <hi>perpetuae &amp; ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae quaestiones;</hi> and so many <hi>Quaesitores</hi> of those seuen crimes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For the conisance of all other publike crimes, did remaine still in the people, as afore.</p>
                     <p>But when so euer it happened either afore or after the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing of such <hi>perpetuall and ordinarie Enquiries,</hi> that the people (as it seemed good vnto them for the time) did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ouer vnto seuerall <hi>Magistrates,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>After this maner <hi>extra ordinem</hi> was a commission <note n="3" place="margin">Liui. lib. 19.</note> of <hi>Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> graunted to <hi>Fabius Maximus</hi> the <hi>Dictatour,</hi> against such
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19125:104"/>
of the men of <hi>Capua,</hi> as were chiefe auctors of the conspiracie, and defection from the <hi>Romanes.</hi> The like to this here in <hi>England</hi> we vsually call a speciall Commission of <hi>Oier,</hi> and <hi>terminer,</hi> for some one matter. All other <hi>priuate</hi> and lesse crimes, the coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance whereof was not reserued to the people, <note n="1" place="margin">l. 1. ff. de Offic. Praefect. vrbi.</note> were <hi>Enquired</hi> of and punished <hi>Ordinarilie</hi> by him that was <hi>Praefectus vrbi:</hi> And therefore they were also called <hi>Ordinaria crimina,</hi> and the coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance which he vsed therein, <hi>Cognitio siue Quaestio ordinaria.</hi> And this appellation and distinction of <hi>Ordinarie</hi> and <hi>Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie</hi> Crimes and Conisance of them, remayned after the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Common weale was surprised by Emperours; being by this occasion first begunne. So that <hi>Extraordinarie</hi> is not that (as some doe ignorantly imagine) which is contrary to good order; but any thing swaruing from the vsuall and more ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie course, and may bee both allowable and expedient; notwithstanding it be so called. And in this acception those wordes in these two rules are to be vnderstoode and taken: viz. <hi>Ubi subest remedium Ordinarium, ibi cessat Extraordinarium:</hi> And, <hi>Ubi cessat Ordinarium, ibi Extraordinarium remedium est aduocandum.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If it shall here be asked, why both the course of <hi>Accusation</hi> (which in olde times was more vsuall) is now lesse frequented; and also why <hi>Enquirie,</hi> that was counted <hi>Extraordinarie,</hi> 
                        <note n="2" place="margin">c. Super his. de accusat.</note> is now become an <hi>Ordinarie remedie,</hi> and <note n="3" place="margin">Bart. in l. infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mem. ff. de public. iud.

                     <p>First, let that be remembred, which hath bene spoken in the next Chapter afore, touching the <hi>Perill</hi> and <hi>Hatefulnesse</hi> of <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusations.</hi> Next, <note n="4" place="margin">Tho. 2. 2. q. 3. 3. art. 6.</note> that things tending to an ende, ought to be directed in such sort, as that ende may best be atteined. And the ende whereunto any Lawe is referred, ought especially to be considered in all both interpretation and practise of Lawes. Whereas then in the times of those frequent <hi>Accusations,</hi> sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry vniust vexations, conspiracies, and calumniations, with other misdemeanours in that behalfe, were very rife and vsuall: Therefore those in auctoritie were forced (to auoyde innocent men from such dangers) besides the former penalties, to make Lawes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> time to time, wholly to repel and keepe backe sundry
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19125:105"/>
sorts of persons from <hi>Accusing:</hi> whereby this kinde of prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion grew dayly to more and more disuse. So that it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site for restraint of <hi>Offenders,</hi> to expect at the Iudges handes for his <hi>Office</hi> sake, this necessarie duetie of prosecuting Crimes; a course more voyde from suspicion of such calumniation: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that ende which the Law shot at, viz. to haue <hi>Offenders</hi> found out and punished, was farre better, and with fewer inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences effected.</p>
                     <p>It was further considered by men of wisdome, how the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the mutuall perill on both sides, did dayly driue both the <hi>Accuser</hi> and the <hi>Accused,</hi> vnto vntollerable extremities. For when the <hi>Accuser</hi> had once vndertaken the matter to his owne apparant danger, if he coulde not proue it: was it not as likely (as it was easie) that he would rather secretly suborne vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true witnesses; then that by his enemies safetie, himselfe should be punished? A matter of fearefull inconuenience, considering that <note n="1" place="margin">l. Absentem. ff. de poenis.</note> 
                        <hi>it is better, an Offender in deede shoulde escape, then that any man which is innocent, should be punished.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>On the contrary side, if the defendant finding himselfe in deede guiltie, should propose his chalenges or exceptions in law against the <hi>Accuser</hi> (which for his defence with Iustice might not be denied vnto him) can it be doubted, but that he might easily also suborne witnesses, for proofe of all his challenges; and so by auoyding the Plaintife from <hi>Accusing,</hi> auoyd also the peril he was in, how pregnant matter soeuer did otherwise lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him? Whereby it might often happen, that some vpright <hi>Accusers,</hi> who euer for pure zeale of Iustice did prosecute, should be endamaged both in their substance and good name; sundry <hi>Offenders</hi> should escape deserued punishment; and so the whole scope of seuere Lawes prouided against Crimes, should be fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated and quite ouerthrowen. And therefore in great wisdome was this rigorous point of Iustice and hatefull course, thought good to be mitigated; and therefore by insensible degrees of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, turned to a more moderate and sase course, not onely for the <hi>Prosecuter,</hi> but also for the <hi>defendant.</hi> For <hi>mitiùs agitur</hi> 
                        <note n="2" place="margin">Abbas in ca. inquis. de accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sat.</note>

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19125:105"/>
is alwayes so tied, that being a prosecution <hi>of Office;</hi> the Iudge needs not lend his assistance, but where he seeth good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable inducement to ground it vpon.</p>
                     <p>All <hi>Enquirie</hi> is either <hi>Generall</hi> or <hi>Speciall.</hi> 
                        <note n="1" place="margin">Bald. in l. ea quidem. C. de accusat.</note> 
                        <hi>Generall Enquirie</hi> is a preparatoriecourse proceeding of <hi>meere Office,</hi> purposed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and finde out criminous persons, within some certaine ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorie or compasse. This is of three sortes. The first is <hi>generall,</hi> in respect of the persons; but <hi>speciall</hi> in respect of the fault: as when the <hi>Coroner</hi> inquireth of a murder committed, and no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine person knowen: or an <hi>Ordinarie</hi> of a forgerie in some cause Ecclesiasticall. And by this <note n="2" place="margin">l. 1. C. de falsa moneta. l. 1. C. de rapt. Virgin.</note> 
                        <hi>Enquirie generall,</hi> in certaine hainous crimes, euerie priuate person may <hi>enquire,</hi> to bring the Offenders in by lawe to be iustified. The second is <hi>generall</hi> in respect of the faultes, but <hi>speciall</hi> in regard of the persons: as when some <hi>Hospitall, College,</hi> or <hi>Cathedrall Church</hi> is visited. The third and last is <hi>generall,</hi> both in respect of the persons and faults, as a generall visitation of a whole <hi>Dioecesse;</hi> or an <hi>Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> made by the <hi>grand Iurie</hi> at an <hi>Assise</hi> or <hi>Sessions</hi> of the Peace for the whole Countie.</p>

                        <hi>Speciall Enquirie</hi> is, when some certaine and singular person and crime also, is enquired of, and brought by due course of iudgement vnto triall, to the intent to be punished. This <hi>Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> is done either when there is a kinde of prosecuter besides the Iudge, albeit the proceeding bee of <hi>Office:</hi> or when there is absolutelie no prosecuter besides the Iudge himselfe, against the partie conuented. There may besides the Iudge be prosecuters of the <hi>Office</hi> in two seuerall degrees. One that doeth prosecute throughout the whole suite: as when an Information for the <hi>Queene</hi> alone, or for the <hi>Queene</hi> and Informer, is put vp at the Common lawe, and is termed by the lawe Ecclesiasticall, <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficium promotum.</hi> The other, which doeth but prosecute or solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite in some part of the suite; as by furnishing the Court with proofes, &amp;c. which is called <hi>Officium mixtum,</hi> in some temporall courtes, a <hi>Relater.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Likewise <note n="4" place="margin">Abbas in e. cum dilectis. de Purg. canonica.</note> 
                        <hi>Officium promotum</hi> is of two sortes. The first is, when a man voluntarilie offereth himselfe to prosecute, called <hi>Promotor voluntarius officij;</hi> and he differeth a litle from a <hi>Partie.</hi> The second is, when the Court assigneth one to sollicite the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi>
                        <pb n="36" facs="tcp:19125:106"/>
who is termed <hi>Necessarius promotor officij,</hi> because hee may not refuse this emploiment. But when no persecuter at all doeth stirre in the matter: then the Court onely doeth it in duetie to the Common wealth, and to see sinne and disorder punished. Then is this <hi>Enquirie</hi> termed <hi>Officium</hi> simplie, or <hi>Officium me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> by the <hi>Canon</hi> lawe, and by the <hi>Ciuill</hi> lawes <hi>Officium Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi> as of more woorth and dignitie, then the other course which is by a <hi>Partie,</hi> and at his petition and instance. For by a more base appellation (in comparison of the former) that lawe ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth this, <hi>Officium Mercenarium, ac si merccde aliquâ propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitâ alterius petitiont quasi deseruiret:</hi> that-is, when the <hi>Office</hi> of the Iudge is (as it were) hired and employed, but at another mans becke, to serue his turne. For albeit in temporall courtes of other realmes, long custome (which is <note n="1" place="margin">Crauetta.

                        <hi>Non videtur facere iniuriam, qui iure pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lico vtitur.</hi> The next priuiledge by lawe yeelded vnto, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>Office</hi> in a <hi>Criminall</hi> cause, which is denied to a prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuter, yea though he bee not an <hi>Accuser</hi> or <hi>Partie,</hi> properlie so called; is, that the Iudge proceeding <note n="5" place="margin">Panor. in c. qualiter. el. 2. de accusat.</note> of <hi>Office</hi> may giue an othe to the defendant, to answere some criminall matter. But it is otherwise, when the suite is at the instance of a partie which prosecuteth, because the defendant ought not to bee driuen to furnish vp his aduersaries intention. Thirdly, an <hi>Ordinarie</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legate <hi>Advniuersitatem causarum,</hi> that proceedeth of <hi>Office,</hi> is not bound to make proofes of the <note n="6" place="margin">Pan. ibid. &amp; alij DD.</note>

superiour Iudge, if an appellation be brought and doe lie) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it sufficeth, that the <hi>fame</hi> is apparant and knowen vnto himselfe. But it is otherwise in a delegate of one cause, or vpon the instance of one, that <hi>voluntarily</hi> prosecuteth. Fourthly, when the sute is at the <hi>instance</hi> of a <hi>partie,</hi> contrarie proofes for proofe of the defendants good <hi>fame,</hi> are admitted. But this need not be granted vpon proceeding <hi>of Office;</hi> because <note n="1" place="margin">Arg. c. in nostr. de procur. &amp;c. ad audientiam de praescrip.</note> the law doth not entend and presume against the sinceritie of the Iudge, as against the <hi>partie</hi> prosecuting.

                        <note n="2" place="margin">Hostiens. in c. cum clamor. de testibus.</note> 
                        <hi>fit litis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testatio</hi> (as I may English it) an issue is ioyned betweene the two parties. But if either one be but a soliciter and assistant to the <hi>Office;</hi> or els a preferrer assigned by the Iudge; or that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding be of meere <hi>Office:</hi> there is then no contestation in the sute (properly so to be termed) but a kinde of contradiction (in sted thereof) required, betwixt the <hi>fame</hi> or <hi>denunciation &amp;c.</hi> on the one side; and the defendants answere by deniall on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side. Lastly, when the proceeding is of <hi>Office,</hi> 
                        <note n="4" place="margin">Arg. c. cum cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor. de testibus.</note> (euen af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter publication) moe witnesses may be receiued, because the feare of subornation in this case ceaseth, being the onely rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of that rule, <hi>viz. that after publication moe witnesses may not be receiued:</hi> Insomuch as depositions of witnesses are alwayes published vnto the Iudge: But new witnesses may not be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, when it is at the prosecution of a <hi>voluntarie partie,</hi> for feare of suborning them in the pointes, where he findes the former depositions came too short of his purpose.

                     </p>
                     <p>But I holde it requisite first to note, what vse hereof and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance vnto the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Enquiry,</hi> the olde <hi>Romanes</hi> had in their policie by <hi>Denunciators;</hi> as it is recorded to memorie in the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill</hi> lawes of that people. Which I do the rather in this place, as in the former discourse I haue done, to meet with the childish and sinister conceit of some; who suppose euery thing deuised and brought in by any <hi>Canon,</hi> how olde or necessarie soeuer it be; to be no better then <hi>Popish</hi> &amp; <hi>Antichristian;</hi> and <hi>eo ipso</hi> (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                     <p>Of those, whom we now commonly call <hi>Denunciators,</hi> the law <hi>Ciuill</hi> hath two sorts. One sort are those, who (being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men) doe willingly (for gaines sake) <hi>denounce</hi> others. Of these <note n="1" place="margin">L. Res quae. § vlt. ft. ad S. C.

                     <p>The other are such, as by reason of some <hi>Office</hi> or publicke charge, layed vpon them, are to <hi>Denounce</hi> offenders vnto the Iudge, to be by him proceeded with, vnto punishment. These (in generall) by the Emperour <hi>Constantinus</hi> haue this title gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto them; <note n="2" place="margin">L. 1.

                        <hi>Publicae solicitudinis cura,</hi> the care and regard of publike watchfulnesse. His wordes to that purpose be these: <hi>In quacunque causa reo exhibito, siue accusator existat, siue eum publicae solicitudinis cura perduxerit; statim debet Quaestio fieri, vt noxius puniatur, innocens absoluatur.</hi> Where (we see) the two kindes of <hi>Criminall</hi> prosecution are touched, and the proceeding of <hi>Office,</hi> is there counterdiuided against <hi>Accusation.</hi>

                     <p>And these hauing such charge, be also of two seuerall sortes.

                     <p>Secondly, when it is made by such, as haue no particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest; it is called <note n="2" place="margin">L. delator. ff. de iure fisci.</note> 
                        <hi>Delatio.</hi> But when it is done <hi>per Aduocatos fisci,</hi> (such as the <hi>Atturney</hi> generall) or by other officers purpose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thereunto appointed, then is it properly called <hi>Denunciatio, viz. An Information</hi> or <hi>Presentment.</hi> And thus much touching <hi>Denunciation in Temporall courts onely.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Denunciation</hi> generally taken, as we gather out of both the lawes <hi>Ciuill</hi> and <hi>Canon,</hi> is of foure seuerall kindes. The first is called <hi>Euangelicall;</hi> the second <hi>Iudiciall;</hi> the third <hi>Canonicall;</hi> and the fourth <hi>Regular.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Euangelicall</hi> is that, which proceedeth by those degrees that our <hi>Sauiour Christ</hi> prescribeth <note n="3" place="margin">Matt. 18. <abbr>V.</abbr> 15</note> in the <hi>Gospell.</hi> There be two ends hereof. <note n="4" place="margin">Spec. tit. d.</note> The principall end is, to procure repentance &amp; amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in him, which offendeth. The secondarie end <note n="5" place="margin">Panor. c. no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit. de iudic.</note> where this cannot be effected; is to restreine others from the like, by his punishment spirituall, onely touching the soule; but not any temporall penaltie, either directly or indirectly. But albeit the purpose of this <hi>denunciation</hi> be the parties reformation; neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse if the crime be such, as hindereth the execution of his ecclesiasticall function; the Iudge <hi>of Office,</hi> is also to depose him, from his <note n="6" place="margin">Alph. li. 2. ca. 9. conclus. vlt. pract.

                     <p>Concerning <hi>Denunciation Euangelicall,</hi> question is mooued by the <hi>Schoolemen</hi> (who in my poore opinion doe handle it for many points, both learnedly and iudiciously) whether in this <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation</hi> those degrees of monition first priuately to the partie offending, and afterward before two or three witnesses, bee necessarie, and at all times to be obserued in all crimes and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19125:109"/>
offences indifferently, before the offender may be <hi>denounced</hi> of them, vnto the Ecclesiasticall Magistrate?</p>
                     <p>For resolution whereof; wee are to distinguish betweene <hi>hidden</hi> or <hi>secret,</hi> and <hi>publike</hi> or <hi>open</hi> crimes or offences. If they be wholly <hi>hidden</hi> and <hi>secret;</hi> then indistinctly those degrees <note n="1" place="margin">Ricar. in 4. Sent. dist. 19.</note> of <hi>monition</hi> there prescribed, are first to be obserued, before it may be <hi>denounced</hi> to the Iudge; whether the offender by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising amendment and shewe of griefe, doe giue any hope of his repentance and reformation; or doe giue none at all: sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing where the crime is of such qualitie, as that <note n="2" place="margin">Thom. 2. 2. q. 33. art 2. &amp; Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car. vbi supra.</note> it tendeth to some great and important dammage bodily or ghostly of the whole bodie of Church or Common weale, or of many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular persons: as, if it be <hi>Heresie, Conspiracie,</hi> or such like. For insomuch as such one <hi>sinneth</hi> herein, not only <hi>against</hi> thee (as the text speaketh) but against others also, albeit they knowe not thereof: therefore thou oughtest forthwith <hi>Euangelically</hi> to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce</hi> and present such an offence vnto the magistrate; to the entent the publike danger may be speedily preuented: conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that <note n="3" place="margin">Gabr.

                     <p>Concerning crimes or offences, we are to vnderstand, that they may be sayd to be <note n="4" place="margin">Petrus de Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude. in. 4. Sent. 19. q. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>publike</hi> or <hi>open</hi> two maner of wayes: either when they are committed <hi>openly;</hi> or when being secret, yet they be published abroad, and the offender is <hi>famed</hi> &amp; brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, to haue committed them. Now if by either of these wayes, an offence be made open and <hi>publike;</hi> then it is to be <hi>denounced</hi> vnto him that hath authoritie to correct it; yea though neither of the sayd <hi>monitions</hi> haue bene precedent. For <note n="5" place="margin">Thom. 2. 2. q. 33. art. 2.</note> we are to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide, not onely that he which hath offended, may be made bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and brought to repentance: but also that others to whose knowledge it is come, be not thereby scandalized &amp; offended; according to that rule of <hi>S.

                        <hi>Iudge,</hi> that the scandale which might arise thereof, may be (aforehand) preuented. So that if the chiefe end of this <hi>Denunciation</hi> cannot: yet the secondarie end may hereby be attained.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Neither let any man in regard of this Denunciation feare to be accounted malicious</hi> (saieth <note n="1" place="margin">August. ad Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonium.</note> S. <hi>Augustine:) for you are rather blame woorthie, if by holding your peace, ye shall suffer your brother to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish; whom you might haue saued by denouncing of his fault vnto them in authoritie.</hi> And againe, <note n="2" place="margin">August. ibid.</note>

The other <hi>Canonicall denunciation</hi> is more <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,</hi> in that it may be preferred by any whomsoeuer; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth either the hinderance <note n="4" place="margin">c. praeterea. de Sponsalib. c. cum inhibitio. de cland. despons.</note> or dissoluing of some mariage contracted or to be contracted, within the degrees forbidden: or els the desisting from some sinne, which is of that qualitie, that it increaseth by multiplicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Acts in the same kind, or by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of some one Act, and wherein the <hi>Denouncer</hi> hath none other particular interest, then as euery <hi>Christian</hi> hath besides.</p>
                     <p>The last kind called <hi>Regular,</hi> is that <hi>Denunciation</hi> 
                        <note n="5" place="margin">Specul. tit. de Denunt. §. 2. vers. vt. autem.</note> which is published by any person in <hi>Chapter,</hi> touching some offence of his brother, committed contrarie to the locall and positiue rules or statutes of that place; to the intent he may amend it hereupon, rather then that it should come to a more <hi>publike denunciation;</hi> and from this, there lieth none <hi>Appellation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The two first kinds of <hi>Denunciation,</hi> viz. <hi>Euangelicall</hi> and <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall,</hi>

doe differ the one from the other, in sundry points, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speciallie in these following. First, <note n="1" place="margin">Pan. in c. noult. de Iudiciis. addie.

But none are to bee admitted to the publike <hi>Iudiciall denunciation;</hi> besides those which be specially thereunto appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: sauing that the <hi>Canons</hi>

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Euangelicall denunciation</hi> is referred to the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the offender; whereas vpon the <hi>publike Iudiciall,</hi> his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment is propounded for an end thereof: and the <hi>priuate</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred both to such punishment, and that the thing be restored, and the <hi>denouncer</hi> also preserued harmelesse.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, vpon <hi>Euangelicall denunciation</hi> there is no procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in <hi>foro contentioso,</hi> or iudiciallie, but onely in <hi>Poemtentiali:</hi> whereas vpon <hi>Iudiciall denunciation,</hi> there ensueth a due course of <hi>Iudiciall</hi> proceeding; and thereof it hath his name.</p>
                     <p>Fourthlie and lastly, in <hi>priuate iudiciall denunciation</hi> or witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses (other then such as be lawfull and without iust exception) are admitted; because it lieth for restitution of some thing: But in <hi>Euangelicall,</hi> for proofe of the first <hi>priuate</hi> monitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi> alone must (of necessitie) be admitted for the witnesse, if the <hi>denounced</hi> doe denie the fault: and for proofe of the second mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, any one other (together with the <note n="3" place="margin">

                     <p>But albeit the lawe be thus, for admitting of some and reie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of others from <hi>denouncing:</hi> yet throughout all <hi>Italie,</hi> and in other places of <hi>Christendom</hi> besides; <note n="4" place="margin">Alphons.

hee doe it of his owne voluntarie minde, or by occasion of a Charge and duetie in that behalfe laied vpon him. The reason hereofis; for that the Common wealth hath interest to haue offences punished: which could not so readilie bee done, if by this way of <hi>denouncing</hi> they were not at all brought vnto the Magistrates notice. A matter otherwise likely to happen by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of so many difficulties that accompanie <hi>Accusation,</hi> and so many exceptions, which may (by lawe) be taken both agaynst <hi>Accusers</hi> and <hi>Denouncers.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>Likewise in courtes <hi>Temporall</hi>

Also such <hi>Officers</hi> must present all casuall violent deaths: because albeit perhaps nothing doe presently appeare, but that such death did casuallie happen: yet in processe of time, it may fall out to be discouered, that it was by some malefactour.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, when such as haue charge to enquire generally, and to present, either doe not know certainlie whether an offence be committed or not, (a thing which may happen in such crimes whereof no traces or footesteps after the fact done can remaine; as in <hi>Adulterie, diffamation,</hi> and such like:) or where a fact doeth appeare, but the <hi>Author</hi> thereof is not knowen (as may bee in murder, sacrilege, forgerie, &amp;c.) in both these cases, if the commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> voyce and <hi>fame</hi> doe runne against any person in particular, they are bound to present euen such <hi>fame</hi> of the offender, as wel as the crimes themselues; together with all the circumstances they can learne thereof, &amp; who be more perfectly instructed touching it, that perhaps can giue particular and more full euidence.</p>
                     <p>He that is a <hi>denouncer</hi> by vertue of his <hi>Office,</hi> is alwayes in his <hi>presentments</hi> to obserue, that he bee not found to haue preferred matter agaynst anie, by <hi>manifest calumniation</hi> or wilfull conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racie.

The reason hereof is, because in that he proueth not his Complaint; the Lawe presumeth euen hereupon, that he did but moue it by <hi>Calumniation,</hi> for vniust vexation.

                     <p>Nowe it followeth to shewe (so neere as I can) what course of dealing against Crimes and offences is holden both in the Court of Ecclesiasticall commission (which of the two is more egerly impugned) and also in <hi>ordinarie</hi> Courts <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> at least so farre as by Lawe is warrantable, if an appellation be brought.</p>
                     <p>The matters handled in the <hi>Commission Ecclesiasticall,</hi> are such <hi>Crimes Ecclesiasticall</hi> as are spoken of in the first treatise: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aggrauated (aboue the ordinarie course of them) by some circumstance of moment. Also these besides, attaching, and conuenting of <hi>Iesuites, Seminarie Priestes</hi> and <hi>recusants of both sorts, execution and punishment of the breache of certaine Statutes,</hi> as touching her <hi>Maiesties</hi> lawfull <hi>superioritie Ecclesiasticall,</hi> yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto her Highnesse by <note n="1" place="margin">7. &amp; 5.

                     <p>These matters are brought thither, when <hi>Ordinaries</hi> be noted of negligence in giuing redresse: or when they desire aide, either for the greatnesse of the <hi>partie,</hi> whom poore men dare not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent or denounce, or for the <hi>delinquents</hi> often remoouing from one <hi>Dioecesse</hi> to another, or for the dwelling of the witnesses else where, or for the offenders frequent, friuolous, and chargeable appeales, or for such like considerable occasion: or vpon credible information made by some great personage, or of some that be
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:19125:112"/>
in that Commission, or being referred from her <hi>Maiestie,</hi> or from the <hi>Lords of the Counsell:</hi> or vpon complaint of some <hi>partie</hi> iustly grieued, otherwise being without remedie: or by complaint of a whole Parish, or of a great part thereof: or vpon frequent relation of sundry credible persons taking offence and griefe thereat (and setting downe particular euidence of the facte) or in <hi>aide</hi> and <hi>as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance</hi> of <hi>ordinarie</hi> Iurisdiction: as when the <hi>delinquent</hi> hath no certaine place of abode: or lastly by some <hi>notorietie of the fact,</hi> as by the parties knowen hand-writing: or for a matter done in great assembly of people, and such like.</p>
                     <p>Hereupon Articles be framed, wherein are conteined the place, time, and oftentimes the persons able to testifie &amp; informe further, and all such other circumstances and <hi>Indicia,</hi> (which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprete as the worde is commonly vsed <hi>Euidences,)</hi> tending to the plainer manifestation of the Crime. The Articles are perused and allowed to be incident to the conisance of that Court, and conteining sufficient detection to open a way to proceede (by way of further <hi>enquirie ex officio,</hi> into that crime) by one of those three <hi>Commissioners</hi> at the least, (whereof one is of the <hi>Quorum)</hi> that doe subscribe the Processe, for conuenting of the <hi>partie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This Processe is either by way of <hi>Citation</hi> (commonly there called <hi>letters missiue)</hi> or by way of <hi>attachment,</hi> when the <hi>partie</hi> is fugitiue, or flitting, or the Crimes be <hi>grieuous</hi> and publikely <hi>offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue,</hi> so that it may probably be feared, he will lurke or steppe out of the way for a time. But in both courses, some one is bound to the Queenes Maiestie to prosecute, &amp; to furnish the Court with witnesses for proofe of the matter, not to compound it priuately, and to pay charges vnto the <hi>partie,</hi> if it shal appeare he hath bene (without iust cause) troubled. Yet where the <hi>Commissioners</hi> themselues are sufficiently enformed <hi>Indicijs,</hi> viz. with <hi>euident matter</hi> against the <hi>partie,</hi> and where no such <hi>prosecutor</hi> or <hi>relator</hi> doeth offer to follow it, (so that the Court it selfe takes chiefe care of the prosecution) in some like fewe cases, such bonde is omitted.</p>
                     <p>Nowe when as the <hi>partie</hi> appeareth (for such iust conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations as hereafter are debated and prooued lawfull) he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired on her <hi>Maiesties</hi> behalfe, to take <hi>oathe</hi> to answere the <hi>Articles</hi> or <hi>Interrogatories</hi> truely, (being matters of his owne

facte and knowledge, so farre foorth as by lawe he is bound) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euery particular thereof be made knowen vnto him; least after perusall (afore his oath taken) he be drawen by counsell to answere cautelously, indirectly, or wholly to refuse to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere: perhaps, because he sees they touch him ouer neerely, as coniecturing by whom they may be prooued. But after the <hi>oath</hi> is taken (in setting downe his answere) he may consider as aduisedly, and deliberate for so long time, as in any reason may be desired.</p>
                     <p>And thus farre foorth the partie conuented, is (for the most part without any partie at all) proceeded with, but <hi>ex officio Iudicum nobili vel mero:</hi> to the intent, he may not bee priuile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to say, that he is not bounde to answere; being at the suite of the <hi>Office,</hi> and duetie of the <hi>Iudge</hi> (for the publique in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest of the Church and Common-weale) as perhaps by Lawe he might, if it were at first preferred and prosecuted by <hi>a partie.</hi> But after he hath perfitely answered them (for the most part) <hi>a partie</hi> is then made; who (if sufficient matter be not confessed thereupon to proceede vnto a iudgement, vpon the Articles and answere) doeth take vpon him to prooue it by witnesses; and then <hi>Interrogatories, exceptions against witnesses,</hi> and other <hi>defenses,</hi> (for the conuented partie) are vsed almost wholly, as in <hi>Ordinarie</hi> Courtes. By which making of <hi>a partie,</hi> that which was <hi>merum officium</hi> afore, doeth afterward become <hi>officium mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> viz. <hi>ex mero &amp; promoto.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When the matter comes to finall iudgement, if the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie bee conuicted, hee is punished either by <hi>penance,</hi> (for his reformation, and for satisfaction of the Church offended) or by <hi>imprisonment, fine,</hi> or <hi>censures</hi> of the Church, or by so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, as is thought fittest, or by him or others most fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or to be most conuenient, weighing alwayes the qualitie of the person, and the offence, together with other circumstances thereof.</p>
                     <p>In <hi>ordinarie Iurisdiction,</hi> Crimes be vsually proceeded against either <hi>ex officio promoto,</hi> that is, at the <hi>instance</hi> and petition of some, that will voluntarily stirre vp and sollicite the <hi>Iudge vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his duetie:</hi> or else <hi>ex officio Iudicis mero.</hi> In the first of these, albeit the partie conuented is bound to answere matters
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:19125:113"/>
by oathe (if it bee required) so they bee not of the Crime ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected: yet the rule is, that he is not bounde to answere (vpon oathe) touching the very Crime it selfe, notwithstanding <hi>a fame</hi> doe runne hereupon, vntill he shalbe enioyned his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
                     <p>But when an <hi>Ordinarie</hi> proceedeth against a crime, without a partie promouent, viz. <hi>ex officio mero:</hi> then his proceeding must be grounded either vpon a presentment of a fame, or of the crime (made by such as be specially deputed thereunto, as Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens, &amp;c.) or proued by other witnesses, or else vpon <hi>notorie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the facte,</hi> speeches and information (of credible persons touching such fame or scandale thereupon risen) brought often vnto his eares (which is called <hi>clamosa insinuatio)</hi> or by some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther course allowed by lawe to be sufficient, to open a way vnto such proceeding.</p>
                     <p>If it be vpon a perfite <hi>presentment</hi> of the <hi>crime</hi> or <hi>fame</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Iudge may safely without doubt of nullitie or grieuance in that behalfe proceede <hi>ex officio:</hi> and so may vrge the partie presented to answere vpon his oath, touching the very crime it selfe.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:19125:114"/>
handled in this second part, which is this, viz. <hi>that an ecclesiasticall Court may not proceede against any crime, without an Accusation or presentment.</hi> And it falleth in now very aptly to be treated of in this place.</p>
                     <p>But if it should be said, that vnder the worde <hi>presentment,</hi> any <hi>denunciation</hi> whatsoeuer were vnderstood by the authors of that opinion: besides that it is neuer so generally taken, the practice of <hi>ecclesiastical iurisdiction</hi> also, would not then (hereby) be restrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (which that opinion especially shooteth at) but rather much more enlarged, then they would be willing vnto. And yet though it were so generally to be vnderstood; neuerthelesse this opinion could not be truely defended, as shall here be made manifest God willing.</p>
                     <p>It is shewed before, that <hi>Accusation</hi> and <hi>Presentment</hi> be cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of proceeding most properly and peculiarly incident to Courtes, guided either by the <hi>Ciuill,</hi> or by <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> lawes. So that we finde the authors of this opinion herein to deale some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more liberally, then certaine doe in other points: in that these doe hereby allow vnto an <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> Court, some course of proceeding, according to the lawe <hi>ecclesiasticall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I mind first to impugne this opinion, by shewing out of those two lawes, that a Iudge may haue Conisance against crimes, not onely vpon the prosecution of some partie, which is none <hi>Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser;</hi> but also <hi>of Office</hi> by way of <hi>speciall enquirie;</hi> though no such <hi>solemne presentment</hi> be preferred vp, by <hi>Officers</hi> purposely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto appointed: and therefore, that sundry proceedings are war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted against crimes, without <hi>Accusation,</hi> or <hi>presentment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It hath bin shewed afore, that <note n="1" place="margin">l. libellorum. ff de accus. l. 5. C. de his qui accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sare non possunt.</note> vnto euery <hi>Accusatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                        </hi> of the <hi>Accuser</hi> to endure <hi>poenam talionis,</hi> in case he proue not his intention, is necessarily required. But the proceeding to the coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance of a crime by way of <hi>Exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> repulsiue</hi> only, or both <hi>Repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siue</hi> &amp; <hi>Recriminatiue</hi> against the <hi>Accuser;</hi> is done by a <hi>partie,</hi> that is not to vse such <hi>Inscription:</hi> And therfore some proceeding may be against crimes by a <hi>partie,</hi> that is none <hi>Accuser.</hi> The like is truely to be said of both the sortes of <hi>Iudiciall Querelae</hi> or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, mentioned also in the <hi>sixth Chapter</hi> of this second part.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, at the <hi>Ciuill</hi> lawe, both <hi>Delatours</hi> of conceale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or intrusions, and <hi>Delatours</hi> also vpon pecuniarie penall
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19125:115"/>
lawes, doe omit such <hi>Inscription:</hi> and therefore are none <hi>Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers.</hi> For if we will affirme the proceeding vpon their prosecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be at the instance of a <hi>partie;</hi> then doth it follow hereupon, that some may be a <hi>partie</hi> in preferring offences &amp; faultes, which is none <hi>Accuser.</hi> But if we will call it proceeding of <hi>Office,</hi> yet is it still without any <hi>presentment</hi> by <hi>officers</hi> specially thereunto appointed. And therefore it followeth, that the lawe <hi>Ciuill</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth some prosecution of offences, without either <hi>Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or <hi>Presentment.</hi> The same may be affirmed of <hi>Prosecutours</hi> or parties at the law <hi>ecclesiasticall,</hi> prosecuting either <hi>exofficio pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moto vel mixto.</hi> For there is neither <hi>Inscription</hi> to make them <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusers,</hi> nor <hi>presentment</hi> by <hi>officers</hi> thereunto assigned.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps here (by <hi>praeoccupation)</hi> that <hi>Rule</hi> wilbe obiected by some, whereby is said, that <hi>No man is to be condemned without an Accusour.</hi> Which doth encounter both that which is to be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by me against this opinion; and also for, and in behalfe, of all this proceeding of <hi>Office:</hi> and also doth ouerthrowe the opinion it selfe, that we haue nowe in handling. For <hi>presentment,</hi> which is one of the courses allowed by this opinion, hath none vse in an <hi>Accusation,</hi> but onely openeth a way to the Iudges <hi>Office</hi> for <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall enquirie</hi> against him that is presented. So that if by such <hi>Rule</hi> no prosecution might be against crimes, otherwise then by <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation:</hi> then all <hi>presentments,</hi> which be preparatories to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of <hi>Office,</hi> must wholy cease.</p>
                     <p>For clearing of which doubt, I answere: that if this were a <hi>Rule</hi> (as is pretended) yet (like as all other <hi>Rules)</hi> it hath many limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, or excepted Cases. But <note n="1" place="margin">Duaren. disput. anniuer. li. 1. c. 38.</note> a great learned <hi>Ciuilian</hi> of late times teacheth vs, that no such <hi>Rule</hi> can be gathered out of any lawe, and therefore was (through mistaking) framed but by the common sort of Interpretours onely. The wordes of law, whence it is pretended to be gathered, be these: <note n="2" place="margin">l. Rescrip. § si quis. ff. de mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerib. &amp; honor.</note> 
                        <hi>If a man haue none Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser, let him not bee debarred from Offices of credite and honour.</hi> Nowe it is not hereby forbidden to condemne an offendour vpon any course of proceeding besides <hi>Accusation;</hi> but only that a man shal not for a supposed offence, in the meane time be kept from bearing offices, vntill he shalbe iudicially called into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion for it. This will more plainely appeare so to be, if we shall call to our remembrance, how many sundry sortes of <hi>Denounci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atours</hi>
                        <pb n="55" facs="tcp:19125:115"/>
(afore spoken of) were receiued and vsed by the <hi>Ciuill</hi> law in the olde <hi>Romane</hi> Common weale and Empire, who were not tied to any <hi>Inscription.</hi> And besides these <hi>denunciatours,</hi>

And in truth it must needs turne to the great preiudice of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weale, if no Magistrates at all should deale against any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, vntill some <hi>Accusers,</hi> yea or <hi>denouncers</hi> might be found.</p>

Which doth argue plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the custome was then, to haue other sorts of offenders sought for, and found out by the Iudges and Magistrates; yea though none other man preferred matter against them.

                     <p>Now therefore I will shew, that there is allowed prosecution of speciall crimes of <hi>Office;</hi> yet without any such <hi>Presentment</hi> precedent, as by this opinion is implied. It is true by the <hi>Rule</hi> of law, that <hi>generall Enquiry</hi> is precedent as a preparatorie course to make way vnto the Iudges <hi>Office</hi> of proceeding by <hi>speciall Enquirie</hi> against such, as thereby shall be detected, denounced, &amp; presented. In which respect it is said, that <note n="4" place="margin">c. qualiter el. 2. deaccusat.</note> 
                        <hi>as Inscription goeth before Accusation; so doth Presentment before Enquirie.</hi>

                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:19125:116"/>
Now, vpon detection made vnto them, either vpon <hi>generall enquirie,</hi> or otherwise (as it is testified by learned <note n="1" place="margin">Salycetus in l. fin. C. de Quaest. Iul. Clarus. lib. 5. §. fin. q 11.</note> writers in the <hi>Ciuill</hi> law) such Iudges as be discreet and sage, doe customably (in most prouinces) secretly receiue the witnesses depositions in writing (for the information of the Court) before the supposed offender be cited either <hi>really</hi> by attachment, or <hi>verbally</hi> by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse serued on him. This they doe thus afore-hand, in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects: both that the defendant be not forewarned to flie or to hide himselfe; and that the witnesses (by subornation or other sinister practise of the defendant) be not drawen away afterward to denie the trueth, and to depose the contrary.</p>
                     <p>If the defendant shall afterward make his apparance, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie the matter obiected against him; then be the witnesses re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examined and sworne againe in his presence. But if he shall still wilfully absent himselfe; in that case the first examination of the witnesses may serue for the Iudge to proceed by, euen vnto <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitiue sentence</hi> against him.</p>
                     <p>This first receiuing of <hi>information</hi> from witnesses, is called in that law <hi>Processus informatiuus;</hi> and the rest of the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of the Iudge after the defendants apparance, or his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full absence, is <hi>processus punitiuus.</hi> And vnto the taking of the <hi>processe informatiue</hi> (though some haue disputed otherwise) it is commonly holden, <note n="2" place="margin">Ferretus. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sil. 31. num. 11.</note> not to be necessarie; that the supposed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent should be called. Which course of taking informations doth very much resemble the examination and enquiry against suspected malefactors, which commonly is vsed by Iustices of the peace and other Magistrates here in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But albeit detection rising vpon <hi>generall enquirie,</hi> doe (in this sort) often and very vsually make way to <hi>speciall:</hi> yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse both those lawes do mention many and sundry other recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued meanes besides, whereupon to ground a Iudges <hi>speciall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie:</hi> So that albeit <hi>Presentment</hi> be one; yet is it not the onely meanes, to open a way vnto proceeding of <hi>Office by enquirie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first of such meanes is a <hi>Fame</hi> of an offence to be by some certeine person committed. For albeit no <hi>Fame</hi> be presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>officers</hi> specially appointed: yet if there be such a <hi>fame</hi> in deed to be prooued, when need shall require; <note n="3" place="margin">Panor. in c.

                     <p>Now whensoeuer a <hi>fame</hi> touching some offence, runneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any person: the Iudge may thereupon ground his <hi>Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie.</hi> For it is the common opinion of writers <note n="5" place="margin">Card.

                     <p>If <hi>Fame</hi> be very brimme and rife, <note n="10" place="margin">Panor. c. Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio loco. de pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. &amp;c.

Fourthly, <hi>fame</hi> is not required, <note n="6" place="margin">Innoc. in c.

For in such case, to the end of keeping backe an vnwoorthie person; the superiour without either <hi>fame</hi> or other inducement, ought to enquire of <hi>meere office,</hi> very carefully touching him. But
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:19125:118"/>
it is otherwise, when <hi>enquirie</hi> touching a fault is instituted against one that is already admitted into that function, whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding be then for his remoouing, or for other punishment.</p>
                     <p>On the contrary side it is receiued by the lawe <hi>Canon,</hi> that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit an euil <hi>fame</hi> yea <note n="1" place="margin">Panor. in c. qualiter. el. 2. de accus.</note> though it be not <hi>scandalous</hi> and offensiue, be sufficient to ground <hi>enquirie</hi> against a priuate or commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: yet euery <hi>fame</hi> (except it be also <hi>scandalous)</hi> will not suffice so to proceed against a <hi>Prelate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The whole course by lawe prescribed touching <hi>infamie</hi> or <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill fame</hi> going afore a <hi>speciall enquirie,</hi> in other <note n="2" place="margin">Clarus. vbi su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra. q. 6.

                     <p>Neuerthelesse in the courtes <hi>Ciuill</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> within this Realme, this kind of proceeding vpon an <hi>Infamie</hi> according to the very prescript forme of those lawes, is still required to be practised and obserued. So that by this discourse (how <hi>fame</hi> doeth open a way to <hi>enquirie)</hi> may appeare, the vntrue and iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Calumniations</hi> of those men, who being led by ignorance, or some worse matter; doe buzze abroad, that <hi>Ordinaries</hi> may make a <hi>fame,</hi> when and how often themselues list. But if they could; to what purpose should they be so vniustly minded, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing (by lawe) so many sundry other sufficient inducements be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>fame,</hi> to ground their <hi>speciall enquiries</hi> vpon; as partly haue bene, and partly yet remaine to be here opened?</p>
                     <p>For another &amp; a second means besides <hi>presentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,</hi> which doeth also ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> way vnto <hi>speciall enquirie,</hi> is <hi>Clamosa insinuatio,</hi> being not very vnlike to a <hi>fame,</hi> yet not the same. And it is, <note n="3" place="margin">c. qualiter. el. 2. de accus. &amp;c. licet Heli. de Simonia.</note> 
                        <hi>when as a Iudge stirred vp by sundry frequent reports of credible persons</hi> (yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their depositions) <hi>doeth descend to speciall enquirie, euen with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any preferrer or prosecuter.</hi> And this is to be done by him, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as without <hi>scandale</hi> and offence, it cannot be dissembled or win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked at. For in this case, not only the iudge may, but also he ought to proceed vnto <hi>enquirie of his meere office,</hi> against him which is so detected and <hi>scandalous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A third means of grounding <hi>speciall enquirie</hi> besides <hi>present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint,</hi> made either by <hi>priuate Iudiciall,</hi> or by <hi>Canonicall
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:19125:118"/>
denunciation.</hi> For if such be made (yea though no <hi>fame</hi> doeth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare) the Iudge is bound <note n="1" place="margin">Bald. in l. Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipia. C. de seru. fugit. nu. 1.</note> to frame <hi>enquirie of Office</hi> against the partie denounced; or els he is to be punished, no lesse then he is to be, <hi>when publike denunciation or presentment is made by officers,</hi>

But the <hi>priuate Iudiciall</hi> and <hi>generall Canonicall denunciation</hi> doe herein differ from <hi>publike de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation;</hi> because after publike <hi>presentment</hi> 
                        <note n="3" place="margin">Pract.

                     </p>

                        <note n="4" place="margin">Clarus. ibid. q. 7.</note> This <hi>denunciation</hi> commeth in place of a publike <hi>fame,</hi> and thereby openeth a way to <hi>enquirie.</hi> And by Custome <note n="5" place="margin">Alberic. in l. ea quidem. c. de ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus. nu. 9.</note> now ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally receiued in other countries, any man is admitted in this sort to <hi>denounce</hi> an offender, no lesse then those which be <hi>officers</hi> specially deputed.</p>
                     <p>The maner of preferring <hi>denunciations</hi> in the partes on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side, is in effect thus: Hee that <hi>denounceth,</hi> 
                        <note n="6" place="margin">Angel. de Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leficijs.</note> doeth make knowen to the Iudge in Acts, that at such a time by such a man, this or that misdemeanor was committed; and that <hi>N.</hi> and <hi>A.</hi> &amp;c. are more sufficientlic informed in the particulars of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In preferring vp <hi>Presentments</hi> it is to be obserued, <note n="7" place="margin">Clarus. ibid. q. 12.</note> that if the crime be done by <hi>committing</hi> any thing; the place must bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed: but if by <hi>omitting;</hi> then the setting downe of the place, is not required of necessitie.</p>
                     <p>Here perhaps some will obiect against this, &amp; all other means of opening a way to <hi>speciall enquirie,</hi> besides <hi>fame;</hi> sundry spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of writers in both these lawes, whereby they doe seeme to require, that a <hi>fame</hi> necessarilie goe before euery such <hi>enquirie.</hi> But we are taught <note n="8" place="margin">Bossius. tit. de Inquisit. nu. 27.</note> how they ought to be vnderstood; &amp; that in all such places, they do but speake thereof, as of one especial and principall means, not excluding all other: and therefore must be thus take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: that by law a <hi>fame</hi> is but the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> necessarily required; whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> there is neither <hi>denunciatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint,</hi> nor any other means besides, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be allowed to be sufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, whereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d a <hi>special enquirie.</hi>

It may appeare, that at the <hi>Common</hi> Lawe, other meanes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides <hi>Appeale</hi> and <hi>Enditements</hi> (which respectiuely doe resemble <hi>Accusation</hi> and <hi>Presentment)</hi> be receiued to ground a Iudges <hi>Enquirie</hi> vpon, <hi>in Processu informatiuo;</hi> whereupon also follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth oftentimes <hi>processus punitiuus;</hi> that is, the triall of the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. As first, by the common custome and practise of the land. For doe not some seuerall Iustices of the Peace, vpon their owne suspicion conceiued, or vpon secret relation of others (whome they credite) send for men by warrant to be apprehended and brought afore them? doe they not take informations sometimes against supposed offenders, vpon depositions of witnesses, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>partie</hi> be sent for?

Doe they not receiue and sometimes preferre and procure <hi>enditements</hi> to be found (as of common <hi>Barattarie</hi> and such like Crimes) vpon their owne onely suspicions, or by <hi>infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of some one other (perhaps an enemie) and vpon other as meane presumptions? Are not sundrie persons trauelling through some towne, or founde in some priuie searche lodging there (with good reason) oftentimes brought to a straite exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and <hi>enquirie</hi> of matters <hi>Criminall;</hi> vpon the onely view of their persons and deportment, without all further intelligence or cause of <hi>suspicion?</hi> Yet be all these without <hi>Appeale</hi> or <hi>endite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and many times vpon as light and perhaps lighter suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and informations lesse likely and credible, then any be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted (in like case) by the <hi>Commissioners ecclesiasticall;</hi> and much lesse by <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> who must (in case an <hi>Appellation</hi> be brought) in a more strict course of Lawe, be able soundly to iustifie the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements, that they had to leade them into those criminall <hi>que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions</hi> and <hi>enquiries.</hi> Yet vpon these grounds alone, not onely the apprehension of the <hi>parties,</hi> their examinations personall, and the taking of informations from others against them, is founded: but also (as often falleth out) other penalties and disgraces be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; as binding to the Peace, or to their good behauiour, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them to answere <hi>enditements of Barattarie,</hi> or such like; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prisonment of them by a good space, sometimes till the next

Much lesse therefore (being but one) ought she to be taken for sufficient to condemne any, flat contrary to Gods owne <hi>Morall</hi> Lawe.</p>
                     <p>I haue also knowen Articles put vp against a good Minister and Preacher, to haue bene reiected in respect of their insufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, by the <hi>Commission ecclesiasticall.</hi> Yet the same Articles (being preferred euen by his aduersarie, but assisted with some of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance in the Countrey) haue afterwards serued to haue an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditement</hi> found against him, to be a <hi>Common Barattour:</hi> yea by those and before those, who perhaps might all of them be appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, to tell directly, what <hi>Barattaria</hi> truely signifieth and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth; and whence it is deriued.</p>
                     <p>Likewise doe we not see, that vpon the like grounds to some of these, a man may be touched with great disgrace and discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite; and that not vniustly?

not their Iurisdictions from the Prince, but from God alone, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued downe to them by the meanes of the <hi>Pope:</hi> and therefore that their <hi>Courtes</hi> and <hi>Lawes,</hi> (whereby they proceeded) were not in any respect to be accounted for <hi>Courts</hi> holden by the <hi>Kings auctoritie,</hi> or their Lawes the <hi>Kings Lawes.</hi> Whereupon arose that vntrue and preiudiciall phrase of seuerance of a <hi>Court Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian,</hi> from <hi>the Kings Court.</hi> So that if they were confirmed to them, when their Iurisdictions (in facte) were not holden of the King, as now they be, and ought to be by Gods Lawe: is there not then more iust cause so to continue them at this time; seeing they be not so much as <hi>a diuerse</hi> course from the <hi>Customes</hi> and Lawes of the Realme in Courts <hi>Temporall?</hi>

                     <p>To this disputation may be referred that obiection, which the <hi>Notegatherer</hi> maketh touching a <note n="2" place="margin">11. H. 7. ca. 3.</note> statute of <hi>K. Henry the seuenth;</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Note gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.</note> whereupon (he saith) <hi>Empson and Dudley</hi> proceeded, that was <note n="3" place="margin">1. H. 8. ca. 6.</note> repealed by another in the time of <hi>K. Henry the eight;</hi> although
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:19125:125"/>
he putteth it vnder his title of <hi>the lawes of England,</hi> as by them seeking to impugne al proceeding <hi>ex officio;</hi> albeit vnder <hi>present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> (which this opinion alloweth) proceeding <hi>ex Officio,</hi> is necessarily implied, and presupposed.</p>
                     <p>For answere whereof; it is true, that the saide statute was so repealed: but whether it were the same and the onely statute, whereupon <hi>Empson</hi> and <hi>Dudley</hi> proceeded, is left there vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and vntouched. Howsoeuer it was in this behalfe, seeing it authorised all <hi>Iustices of Assise</hi> and of the <hi>Peace,</hi> to proceede thereby; it is most probable, that many besides them two, did also deale by vertue thereof.</p>
                     <p>The effect of the saide statute was, that <hi>vpon information to be made for the King afore Iustices vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any penal statute not extending to life or member, they might (without enditement) heare and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine all offences against the forme of any statute in force.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The reason of making the said statute, is signified by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble to haue bin; for that, <hi>although at Sessions charge was giuen to enquire of many offences against statutes; and Enquests to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect were straightly sworne and charged to enquire and to preferre the trueth: yet they were letted to be found by imbracerie, maintenance, corruption, and fauour; by occasion whereof the statutes coulde not be put in due execution.</hi> And againe in the same place: <hi>The twelue men, for the causes afore rehearsed, will not finde, nor present the trueth.</hi> Howesoeuer this were at that time, it may bee feared, that it is in some place too true still, euen vntill this day. So that if this were then a sufficient cause to make such a statute; the cause still continuing, if not encreasing; that statute will seeme to haue beene (in that regarde) lesse vnreasonable.</p>
                     <p>In the statute of <hi>Repeale</hi> thereof, for the reason of abrogating <note place="margin">1. Hen. 8. c. 6.</note> it, is onely assigned; <hi>That thereby many sinister, craftie, feigned, and forged informations haue beene pursued, to the great damage and wrongfull vexation of the subiectes.</hi> But this might aswell happen, euen when men be prosecuted by way of <hi>enditement.</hi> For is it not vsuall to finde them vpon any one mans euidence and information, the <hi>Iurie</hi> not regarding (oftentimes) what enimitie rests betwixt them? Therefore it was not the course by <hi>information</hi> that displeased; but the badnes of the <hi>informations</hi>
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:19125:126"/>
that gaue occasion of repeale. For by statute, euen in <hi>K. Hen.</hi> 8. <note place="margin">31. Hen. 8. c. 14.</note> his dayes, an <hi>Information</hi> was made equiualent <hi>vnto a presentment by verdict of twelue,</hi> in matter of <hi>heresie,</hi> that is far more penal, then the former. Which cruell statute I would not haue alledged, but that the <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> groundeth himselfe thereupon, for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpose.</p>
                     <p>And we see, that there is no such cause alledged, as the <hi>Note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatherer</hi> insinuateth; either as if it were an vniust &amp; vnreasonable course, or in respect that it was <hi>ex officio,</hi> at the instigation and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitation of some one person; or yet, that it was without <hi>Appeale</hi> or <hi>Enditement.</hi> For if it had bin simply vniust; then all the treasure which had bin leuied by colour thereof, should haue bin resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And it is euident, that <hi>Bils</hi> and <hi>Informations</hi> against <hi>offenders,</hi> are still in frequent vse, and may be preferred for the Queene by any, and against any, whomseuer. And those which be found <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,</hi> may (without either <hi>Appeale</hi> or <hi>Enditement)</hi> be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and punished thereupon in sundry geat penalties and losses both <hi>pecuniarie, corporall,</hi> and of their good name and credite.</p>
                     <p>And for further proofe, that it is at this day holden none vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice by the <hi>tempor all</hi> lawes for to ground an <hi>enquirie,</hi> yea, and also a <hi>Conuiction</hi> without either <hi>Appeale</hi> or <hi>enditement,</hi> is plainely prooued by a latter statute, which is yet in force.

                        <hi>with the right order of Iustice, nor good equitie, that any person should be conuict, and put to the losse of his life, good name, or goods; vnlesse it were by due accusation and witnesse, or by presentment, verdict, confession, or processe of outlawrie.</hi> Which wordes (you see) doe speake of <hi>conuiction, and of being put to losse</hi> of one of those three, and not of the calling into question and maner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. This doeth appeare, in that to the worde <hi>Accusation</hi> is ioyned <hi>Witnesse,</hi> with a copulatiue: whereas the opinion (whereof we treate) implieth, that either vpon any <hi>Accusation</hi> or yet vpon <hi>Presentment</hi> (without any more adoe) an <hi>Ordinary</hi> may grounde his further proceeding. But a man may not be <hi>conuicted</hi> in a Court <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> either vpon a bare <hi>Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>Presentment</hi> without <hi>witnesses,</hi> or his owne <hi>confession:</hi> to which (I thinke) may well and with good reason be added, <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full contumacte,</hi> and not <hi>presumed</hi> onely; which <hi>contumacie</hi> both in <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> Courtes, and some others of this Realme, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounteth to as much (in construction of lawe) as a <hi>confession:</hi> and it hath a correspondence vnto an <hi>Outlawrie,</hi> that is a kind of conuiction, at the <hi>Common</hi> lawe, grounded vpon wilfulnesse onely presumed.</p>
                     <p>Moreouer, this <hi>preamble</hi> doth not rest in the two wordes of <hi>Accusation</hi> or <hi>Presentment,</hi> being the onely things required (by this opinion) to warrant proceeding <hi>Ecclesiasticall;</hi> but addeth also <hi>witnesse, verdict, confession,</hi> or <hi>processe of outlawrie:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot (by any meanes) be referred vnto <hi>enducements,</hi> to ground proceedings vpon, but onely vnto meanes of <hi>conuiction:</hi> and the rather, because in that whole sentence, no <hi>verbe passiue</hi> is vsed, but <hi>conuicting and putting to losse, &amp;c.</hi> which maketh me the more to maruell, how the word <hi>Presentment,</hi> with a disiunctiue, came in amongst the rest: as if by a <hi>Presentment</hi> alone, a man might be <hi>conuicted,</hi> or <hi>put to losse</hi> of any of these three.</p>
                     <p>Some other wordes following in the same <hi>preamble,</hi> are also <note place="margin">Ibidem.</note> brought for this purpose, viz. wherefore <hi>it is not reasonable, that any Ordinarie, by any suspicion conceiued of his owne fant asie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due Accusation or Presentment, shoulde put any subiect of this Realme, in the infamie and slaunder of heresie, to the perill of losse of life, losse of name and goods.</hi> These wordes are inferred vpon the former, and are directed vnto none other crime but <hi>Heresie,</hi>
                        <pb n="78" facs="tcp:19125:127"/>
where the perill and penaltie is so grieuous, as <hi>losse of life, losse of name and goods,</hi> ioyntly together; &amp; therefore can by no reason be drawne &amp; stretched vnto euery other crime <hi>ecclesiastical,</hi> where no such perill of penaltie, or of punishment resteth. For wordes of statutes are of <hi>strict</hi> interpretation, and are most <hi>strict</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters criminall and penall, and therefore may not be extended vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to other crimes, then are expressely mentioned; yea though there were (in both) a like reason. Whereas (in trueth) betwixt the punishment of <hi>Heresie, Atheisme</hi> or <hi>Apostacie,</hi> and other crimes <hi>ecclesiastical,</hi> there is as great dissimilitude as may be. For death in those three is not inflicted, but when all hope of amendement and reformation of the partie himselfe is past, and he is therefore taken away by death, to the intent others may be terrified by the example, and that he haue none opportunitie to entise any moe to his heresies, or to continue in his blasphemies against God. But in the correcting of all other <hi>crimes ecclesiasticall</hi> (though secondarily sometimes the terrour of others is sought) yet principally the parties owne reformation, and bringing vnto penitency and amendement, is intended. For hereby he sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth no losse at all, not so much as of his good name, but rather a gaine; because after his reformation and repentance, he ought to be (of al <hi>Christians)</hi> holden as deare and precious in Gods sight, <note place="margin">The Angels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersion of a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and doe not vpbraide.</note> as if by falling into the sinne, his credite had neuer bin impaired. In which respect those <hi>Canonicall penances</hi> were by the fathers of the Church, and by the olde and pure <hi>Canons</hi> said to be <hi>medicinae animae,</hi> rather then <hi>poenae:</hi> yet not as <hi>satisfactorie for the sinne,</hi> but as good inducements vnto, and also testimonies of repentance.</p>
                     <p>And you knowe, how absurd a kind of reasoning it is, either to argue from one thing to another <hi>à dissimilibus:</hi> or to reason from that which is more likely to be, vnto that which is much lesse likely (viz. <hi>à maiori ad minus)</hi> affirmatiuely, as must needes be out of this place: for thus their obiection must bee gathered: <hi>Without accusation or presentment of heresie; none shalbe put in perill of losse of life, losse of name, and goods: therefore without the one of these two, an Ordinarie may not proceede to the punishment of any other lesse offence ecclesiasticall. Yea though no one of these three, and much lesse all of them be any way thereby hazarded, or brought into perill.</hi>
                     </p>

                        <pb n="79" facs="tcp:19125:127"/>
Furthermore in these last recited wordes there lieth a plaine op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, betwixt <hi>any suspicion conceiued of the Ordinaries owne fantasie:</hi> and <hi>a due accusation or Presentment.</hi> Therefore, if sound and credible information, notice, euidence, or other sufficient matter may appeare to be brought vnto him, so that hee cannot be sayd <hi>suspiciouslie to conceiue it of his owne fantasie onely,</hi> then the true intent hereof is thereby satisfied. But shall the <hi>Preamble</hi> of this repealed Statute stand for sound authoritie, and shall not the equitie and reason of the very bodie of the Statute it selfe, <hi>11. H. 7.</hi> though afterward repealed (much rather then a <hi>Preamble)</hi> be receiued for a good argument; proouing that it is neither vniust nor vnreasonable, at some times to ground a Iudges proceeding <hi>criminall,</hi> without either <hi>Appeale</hi> or <hi>Inditement?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lastlie, here seemeth <hi>a due accusation</hi> or els <hi>a due Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Heresie,</hi> in reason and equitie to bee required: but it is not here, neither (as I take it) else-where by the lawes of the Realme determined, what may bee accounted <hi>a due accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> or <hi>a due Presentment</hi> of a crime in an Ecclesiasticall court. Then (as I construe the lawe) must it bee left vnto the lawe <hi>ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall</hi> to determine, when these may bee sayd to bee <hi>due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi> done, either preciselie, or by that which is aequiualent vnto them.</p>
                     <p>And so we may conclude, that to proceed in an Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Court agaynst a crime, otherwise then either by <hi>Accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> or such <hi>Presentment,</hi> is not contrary or repugnant vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the lawes of the Realme, but rather the like course often practised by them: and thereby the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice &amp; equitie of such proceeding more stronglie confirmed and iustified vnto vs, and the contrarie opinion quite ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He very drift of the second opinion (that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth here to be disputed of) is; that a <hi>Iudge</hi> ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall may not proceed at all of <hi>Office,</hi> or make <hi>speciall Enquirie,</hi> (which is the effect pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by that cause) <hi>against any crimes or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of late persons.</hi> For in debarring them fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> any such, the very whole proceeding against them (vnto which that is the introduction) is thereby also debarred: and by restraining their <hi>citing of Office</hi> vnto causes onely <hi>Testamentarie</hi> or <hi>Matrimoniall,</hi> all dealing against <hi>Crimes</hi> (without there be an <hi>Accuser)</hi> is thereby taken away. Which second opinion therfore quite ouerthroweth the <hi>presenting</hi> of any <hi>laie persons</hi> (though cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous) allowed by the generalitie of the next precedent opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; insomuch as vpon <hi>Presentments,</hi> followeth proceeding <hi>of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by Enquirie;</hi> and yet both these opinions had one <hi>Author.</hi> So well bee these mens conceits digested. But let vs first examine what may be the colourable occasion of this second opinion, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and aboue the impounding of all <hi>ecclesiastical</hi> proceeding vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to those two heads (spoken of in the first part) sauing where the partie conuented himselfe is willing. Which willingnesse in the partie <hi>for rights</hi> that may be supposed to be by him deteined; but especially for <hi>crimes</hi> supposed by him to bee committed, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with any reason be intended, that it shall bee obtained at his hands (considering there is so small vse of any proceeding by <hi>office,</hi> but against <hi>crimes;</hi> and least of all in causes <hi>Matrimoniall</hi> or <hi>Testamentarie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>That no <hi>laie persons</hi> then should be delt with at all, for such crimes, as I haue before prooued to bee of ecclesiasticall cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance; but be suffred to do them without controlment: I thinke (in charitie) not to be their meaning. It must needs then follow, that it is the proceeding against crimes <hi>ex officio Iudicis,</hi> viz. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19125:128"/>
an <hi>Accuser,</hi> which is hereby principallie condemned, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable or vniust.</p>
                     <p>Therefore to prooue it <hi>reasonable;</hi> I mind here (somewhat fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) to shew the necessarie vse &amp; equitie thereof, as well in the one court as in the other. And to cleare it from <hi>vniustice;</hi> I wil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare first, that it is both practised by the <hi>temporall</hi> lawes, &amp; also is by <hi>common</hi> and <hi>statute</hi> law, an allowed proceeding vnto courtes <hi>ecclesiastical:</hi> next, that it is practised not onely by the law <hi>Canon</hi> (which many would take for a sufficient disallowance of it:) but also by the <hi>Ciuill</hi> lawes, subiect to no such exception; insomuch as they are vsed by the rest of <hi>Christendome</hi> for their Common law, by the grounds whereof, all their customarie lawes &amp; ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances be argued &amp; disputed. And lastly, that such course of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding was vsed &amp; is allowed by sundry exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ples in holy <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture:</hi> together with answeres vnto the obiections made to the contrary, as they fall fittest into each of the seuerall parts of this disputation.</p>
                     <p>The equitie and necessarie vse of this course to bee holden, may be shewed by the <hi>partie,</hi> which (by lawe) is supposed to be the exciter &amp; stirrer vp of a Iudge vnto it, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> none other person is found that wil prosecute. This partie I meane, is the <note n="1" place="margin">Clarus. ibid. q. 7</note>

I thinke it will not be so supposed. The like then may be sayd of Ecclesiasticall <hi>officers</hi> and <hi>offences,</hi> notwithstanding all generall <hi>Enquiries</hi> in <hi>Senes</hi> or <hi>Synodes,</hi> and in <hi>visitations.</hi>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:19125:129"/>
giue euidence; or the <hi>Iudges</hi> or <hi>Iustices</hi> of themselues do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme them, and vrge them; notwithstanding the straitnesse of their charge and oath, and that they be taken out of the seuerall parts of euery shire? But be it, that some notorious murtherer or felon, is soby them <hi>endited</hi> at some times: how many other offenders in <hi>penall statutes</hi> (being men of any reckoning in the shire) are <hi>endited</hi> at all, thorowout the Realme, in many yeeres, if none of the bench do take care to vrge the Iuries? as <hi>Recusants</hi> in comming to diuine seruice, such as haue and keepe <hi>Reteiners,</hi> and giue liueries contrary to statute, onely to band in quarrels, and to mainteine bad actions; or yet such as goe excessiuely in apparell, or which violate the statutes appointed for not eating flesh, vpon certeine dayes. Nay, it falleth out often times, that the more to giue edge to such <hi>Iuries</hi> to do their duties, euidence hath bene giuen vnto them in these offences: yea, such and so good, as vpon lesse euidence, they would perhaps haue <hi>endited</hi> a man of <hi>felonie,</hi> to the hazzard of his life, especially if he were but some base fellow. Now, when none almost will be found to giue <hi>euidence</hi> (sauing in such a cause where he findes himselfe or some of his pinched) yea, and not in such neither, if the other partie be a man of any tolerable reckoning or ability; and very few (albeit themselues do perfectly know it, or haue reasonable good euidence giuen, against some man of power) that will finde an <hi>enditement</hi> against such an one, although both he that giueth the <hi>euidence</hi> secretly, and all the <hi>Iurie</hi> may be in some hope, not to be knowen, who it was that did principally stirre in it, because they be sworne to keepe the <hi>Queenes</hi> counsell, their fellowes, and their owne: can it then with reason be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that any man (almost) will be found voluntarily to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an <hi>Accuser,</hi> and to prosecute at his owne costs and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges? Experience teacheth that most men will not, few that dare, and those onely such, as take themselues in some particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar respect, wronged.</p>
                     <p>We see in a great multitude of penall statutes at the <hi>Common</hi> law, how men by <hi>third parts</hi> and <hi>moities</hi> of forfeitures (besides great <hi>priuileges</hi> in proceeding) are as it were allured and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to informe against offenders: yet very few (notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding such great gaine as thereby might be got) are found (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19125:130"/>
such as make an occupation of it) that will voluntarily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre <hi>informations:</hi> albeit there be enow that want the money, and could well be content to finger it, out of what male factours purse soeuer it came.</p>
                     <p>The reasons of this backwardnesse in informing, I take to be the charge, trouble, common obloquie, and offence taken by them <hi>that be prosecuted,</hi> and thereby feare and perill to come vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to some further mischiefe vpon their procurement, or for their fauour. Now, where men that are so well hired, and (by reason the <hi>Queene</hi> is <hi>partie</hi> to such <hi>informations)</hi> so fully in all reason protected, will not, lust not, or dare not preferre matter <hi>penall</hi> against others: shall wee looke for better courage to be shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by priuate persons, against offenders in <hi>Ecclesiasticall crimes;</hi> where they can expect no such countenance nor remunerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to lighten the other burthens and dangers? and therefore either of <hi>Office</hi> to be prosecuted, or must be wholly left vnpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished.</p>
                     <p>In riots committed and done vpon others, we see iust cause of griefe for the iniury receiued: and thereby occasion giuen to seeke lawfull reuenge.

                     <p>Here perhaps it will be said, that he which can giue informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19125:130"/>
of a crime to a iudge; may <hi>accuse,</hi> or procure a <hi>presentment</hi> in an <hi>Eccelesiasticall</hi> Court (if it be of that iurisdiction) or may <hi>informe</hi> and procure an <hi>enditement,</hi> if the cause be Temporall: or els that it were meet his information be not beleeued, but that he should be holden as a slanderer and a malicious person. We are to remember, that if this <hi>Dilemma (viz.</hi> either thou must <hi>accuse</hi> and prosecute him, &amp;c. or else thou art but a slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer) had not <hi>quiddam tertium</hi> to minister answere vnto it; many grieuous faults should passe vnpunished, and many poore men should be sore pinched. For experience teacheth, that <note n="1" place="margin">Clarus ibid. q. 6.</note> often times <hi>euen in crimes publikly committed, you shall hardly finde wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, that will depose their direct knowledge, when it tendeth to the offence of some man of countenance, that may do them a displeasure after.</hi> And therefore they will either say, they saw it not, heard it not, marked it not, or at that time remember it not. Yet it is knowen, that a witnesse is vrged by the religion of an oath, and is not entended to thrust himselfe into the matter willingly: which as it ought to serue to take away all offence conceiued by him whom he toucheth; so ought it to wash away all feare and other affection, in the witnesse.</p>
                     <p>Then how much more probably may it be supposed, that there is many a meane man, (though otherwise able to giue good and true information, perhaps of three or foure witnesses, which doe know the matter more fully, and touching other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularities, sufficient for a <hi>Iudge</hi> to <hi>enquire,</hi> and to looke into the partie so <hi>denounced)</hi> who neuerthelesse in many respectes dare not become an open <hi>Accuser,</hi> or a preferrer of <hi>presentment,</hi> of <hi>enditement,</hi> or of <hi>information?</hi> because there is more cause to take offence at such, then at one, who is called and vrged to te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie. So that if there were no meanes for a <hi>Iudge Ecclesiasticall</hi> to take knowledge, nor to proceed, but vpon the voluntarie prosecution and <hi>accusation</hi> of some <hi>partie,</hi> (which is the course opposite vnto proceeding <hi>ex officio)</hi> then surely many execrable offences that are most displeasing to Almightie God, offensiue to the godly, dangerous to mens inheritances, and to the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders owne soules health; yea and some that be pernicious banes to all religion, vnto professing of God, and to Christianitie it selfe, were like (through want of discouerie and impunitie)
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19125:131"/>
to spread themselues ouer both <hi>Church</hi> and Common-wealth in very short time, before <hi>Accusers</hi> would be found: Namely, <hi>Atheisme, Apostasie from Christianitie, Heresie, Idolatrie, Schisme, Errour in matter of Religion, Sacrilege, Periurie Ecelesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall, Blasphemie, Subornation of periurie aswell in matters of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage and testament (being of speciall consequence) as in others; Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible swearing, Polygamy or many wiues, Incest, Adulterie, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vncleannesse, Drunkennesse, excessiue Vsurie, Simonie, Forge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Ecclesiasticall seales for testimonie, Vsurpation of the holy Ministerie, dangerous Conuenticles, vngodly libelling, and such like.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For who are commonly made priuie to such sinnes, but men of like humour and affection? in whom we may not presuppose such sinceritie of conscience, that for reformation of the partie delinquent, they will abandon all friendship, and aduenture any displeasure; euen but to take a triall (with their great charge and trouble) howe they shall be able to make proofe of such matters against them.</p>
                     <p>Besides these inconueniences, that otherwise would ensue; there be many others, all which (in particularitie) to rehearse, would be ouer tedious. As after an <hi>accusation</hi> be begun, &amp; that the <hi>Iudge</hi> seeth violent presumptions against the partie conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: if the prosecutour for feare, for tediousnesse, for bribes, or by collusion would desist: were it not meet that the <hi>Iudge, of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi> should neuerthelesse proceed by <hi>enquirie;</hi> that the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent may reape, as he hath deserued? is it not meet that a <hi>Iudge</hi> should be more carefull of the publike good of the Common-weale, then euery common person? and if he be so in deede, shall he not be allowed as good meanes to doe these <hi>good offices</hi> to his <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Countrey,</hi> as any priuate person? And shall he not be as much cherished and allowed vpon his owne care, and for his dueties sake, to procure the suppressing of sinne and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of offenders, as to do it, at the instigation of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate partie? Nay is there not lesse danger of suborning, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or instructing of witnesses by a <hi>Iudge</hi> (who hath no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate interest to see a man punished) then there is in the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by a <hi>partie;</hi> who (for the most part) doth it but of malice, or vpon some other sinister respect? And what if any that is in deed a friend, should be <note n="1" place="margin">Ioh. Andr. in add. ad Spec. tit. deinquisitionib.</note> purposely framed to be an <hi>Accuser;</hi>
                        <pb n="87" facs="tcp:19125:131"/>
to the intent some delinquent may escape, and not be called a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into perill, vpon the same <hi>crime?</hi> If it be saide hereunto, that the penaltie of <hi>calumniation,</hi> viz. <hi>poena taltonis</hi> which is to be inflicted vpon him that faileth in proofe of his <hi>accusation,</hi> will take away this suspicion; it may be replied, that in most coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, this <hi>poenatalionis</hi> is growen in disuse: but chiefely this may be answered (euen where that penaltie still hath place) that the <hi>Accuser</hi> may make halfe a good proofe (as by one vpright wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse) and <note n="1" place="margin">c, 1. de elect. in 6.</note> so should both the delinquent escape punishment; and himselfe also (by lawe) be freed from danger of the penaltie of <hi>calumniation</hi> presumed, and of enduring <hi>retaliatio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Besides, the like equitie may also often happen, when onely two sufficient witnesses can testifie of a crime: for if the one of these should be driuen (of necessitie) to be a <hi>partie,</hi> then the full proofes (required in such cases) were thereby cleare taken away; and so the offendour should escape punishment. And therefore there is both necessary vse, and good equitie, to warrant procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>ex Officio,</hi> in matters criminall.</p>

                        <note n="1" place="margin">In his title of Inconueniences.</note> the <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> assigneth sundry <hi>inconueniences</hi> by him surmised to arise thereof. First, (saith he) <hi>In treason and felonie chalenge is admitted to the Accuser: here none. For it is in the Ordinarie to admit one to infourme, and to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse againe in the cause, wherein he was before deposed, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</hi> What these last wordes, viz. <hi>to the contrarie,</hi> doe serue for here; neither I, nor perhaps the <hi>Author</hi> himselfe of the <hi>Notes,</hi> can coniecture. If <hi>Acouser</hi> here be taken for a witnesse (as is afore shewed:) then I must tell him, that challenges and <hi>exceptions</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst witnesses not onely be allowed vnto the defendant at the lawe <hi>Ciuill</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiasticall;</hi> but in a farre more beneficiall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, then is receiued by vse at the <hi>Common</hi> lawe of this Realme. For it is commonly said (howe truely I am not to discusse) that a
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19125:132"/>
witnesse ought not to be receiued nor deposed vpon his oathe for the prisoner, as being against the <hi>Queene.</hi> And if such be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to speake at the prisoners request (as some seldome times hath bin) and be not sworne thereunto: what credite will the Iurie giue vnto his bare wordes? nay what credite may they giue to them, and saue their owne oathes; who are sworne to dealc according to their <hi>Euidence;</hi> which ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be so termed, except it be vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> oath, vpon matter of record, or vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the parties co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fession.</p>
                     <p>But if he take <hi>Accuser</hi> here, for him that voluntarily prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and soliciteth the <hi>office;</hi> then he may remember, that against such, the very <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon</hi> lawe giueth no challenge; because any man may preferre <hi>Enditements</hi> &amp; follow them for the <hi>Queene:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the <hi>Ciuil</hi> law hath whole titles of chalenges that may be made against <hi>Accusers;</hi> which lawes be also retained in those Courtes, against all <hi>voluntarie</hi> preferrers to <hi>the office,</hi> who are holden as <hi>parties.</hi> But if the <hi>Iudge</hi> alone at the <hi>Common</hi> law cause an <hi>Endite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to be put vp; may the prisoner <hi>challenge</hi> the Iudge, when as he shall not challenge any common person, which doth it?</p>
                     <p>That is true in part, which he saith, <hi>that in</hi> 
                        <note n="1" place="margin">Bartol. in 1. Diuus. ff. de cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stod. reorum.</note> 
                        <hi>enquirie of office, a Iudge</hi> (by the <hi>Ciuill</hi> lawe) <hi>may examine him which denounced the matter, as a witnesse therein.</hi> Yet it is not generall in euery <hi>denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceour</hi> or preferrer vp vnto <hi>the office,</hi> but onely in such as be <hi>officers</hi> specially appointed, &amp; sworne for that purpose. Now what wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of equitie, or what iniustice is herein, seeing perhaps such know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the matter best, &amp; was the man that infourmed his fellowes of his particular knowledge therein, which made it to be prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? May not one single man in a graund Iurie doe the like? And what should hinder such a man afterward to giue also particular euidence therof at time of the triall? For is there any course more vsuall, then for him that preferres vp the <hi>enditement,</hi> &amp; giues eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to haue it found; to be also a witnesse, &amp; to giue euidence of the very felonie, &amp;c. at the prisoners triall for life and death?</p>
                     <p>But if it were true, that euery <hi>Infourmer</hi> &amp; prosecutour might be examined also as a witnesse (which is very vntrue both by lawe and practice) howe could this proue, that which he aduou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth; viz. <hi>that no challenge against the Accuser is admitted in Courtes Ciuill and Ecclesiasticall,</hi> seeing both against prosecutors and witnesses by the <hi>Ciuill</hi> &amp; <hi>Canon</hi> lawes, <hi>exceptions</hi> or challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19125:132"/>
may be taken? And though it were true, that this were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally allowed, and were also an inconuenience: shall therefore the examining of one for another, when he ought not in equitie to be, ouerturne all proceeding <hi>of office</hi> as vnreasonable, which is the drift at which he aimeth?</p>
                     <p>Another of his <hi>Inconueniences</hi> hereof is; that <hi>hereby a Bishop may (vpon his owne suspicion) supplie the place of an Infourmer, a Witnesse, and a Iudge.</hi> That his <hi>owne suspicion</hi> alone, will not serue to open way to such proceeding, is shewed afore in the seuenth Chapter. And howe the Bishop being Iudge, should be vsed as a witnesse in the same cause, wherein he is a Iudge; there is no colour in al the lawe or practice, that I haue knowen, or can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. Except it be in a matter done in his owne presence, whiles he sits <hi>iudicially;</hi> and appearing also <hi>notoriously</hi> vnto others there besides himselfe; or espied onely by himselfe.</p>
                     <p>Now if the preiudice to the partie be not very great, why the Iudge alone, aswell as any co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon person there, that might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to haue heard it or seene it, may not be trusted for a sounde witnesse; I for my part can see no cause. Hath the <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> neuer heard of a Cut-purse espied by the Iudge himselfe sitting on the bench, by him caused to be staied, and being <hi>endited</hi> vpon his relation, presently tried and condemned?</p>
                     <p>For a third <hi>inconuenience</hi> hereof, hee assigneth: that <hi>it is a meanes to drawe causes from the Common lawe, when neither in the Citation nor Bill, men shall knowe the cause, why they be conuented: and so are depriued of the meanes of suing a Prohibition at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lawe.</hi> This he termeth <hi>Addere forum foro.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yet <hi>enquirie by office</hi> prescribeth no such generalitie of <hi>Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And therefore if this were true, it maketh nothing against that proceeding. But that a <hi>Libel</hi> doth not conteine the cause of the conuenting, is a very strange, and no lesse bold assertion. If his meaning in this obiection be, that a man cannot procure a <hi>Prohibition,</hi> till he haue the copie of the <hi>Libell;</hi> thereby to shewe the <hi>temporal</hi> Iudge, that something is there in demaunde or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, that is not of <hi>ecclesiasticall Conisance:</hi> then he might more plainely haue declared it. And for mine owne opinion, hereunto I wil agree, that (in most cases) the law is so; howsoeuer late practice be otherwise.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="90" facs="tcp:19125:133"/>
For when the <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> Iudge denieth the copie of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel where he ought not, to the preiudice of the partie, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect: then the statute of <hi>K. Hen.</hi> the 5. and a writ therevpon fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, doth relieue him. And <hi>denying copies of libels,</hi> needed not to <note place="margin">2. Hen. 5. ca. 3. Register. pag. 58.</note> haue bin co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plained of at that time as a grieua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, if the law had bin, that vpon the parties owne suggestion only, without sight of the Libell, the <hi>temporal</hi> Court might at pleasure award a <hi>Prohibition.</hi> So that this not expressing of cause in the <hi>Citation,</hi> and denying <hi>copie of the Libel,</hi> is so farre from being a meanes to drawe causes from the <hi>Common</hi> law vnto those Courts; that it is of it selfe suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to bring thither by <hi>Prohibition</hi> causes originally being of <hi>ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Conisance.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what serueth this <hi>not expressing of the cause of conuenting,</hi> (if it were so) for conde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nation of all proceeding <hi>by Office;</hi> seeing this might no lesse happen to be omitted, though the <hi>prosecution</hi> were at the instance of a <hi>partie</hi> or <hi>Accuser?</hi> Yet further to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie both him and others herein; <hi>Citations</hi> in causes <hi>Criminall</hi> out of <hi>ordinarie</hi> Courtes, Letters missiue, and Attachements out of <hi>Commission</hi> Courtes, doe all import, that there be misdemeanors of <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> Conisance, to be obiected against the partie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented. Albeit to expresse al the particulars, would be both ouer tedious and chargeable to the subiect, and (in many respectes) inconuenient besides. And why should this be accounted any more inconuenient or vnreasonable, then writtes of <hi>sub poena</hi> out of the <hi>Starre-Chamber</hi> or <hi>Chauncerie</hi> are, which conteine not so much particularitie of the matters obiected, as those <hi>Citations</hi> in <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> Courtes?</p>
                     <p>In the reigne of <hi>K. Hen.</hi> the 8. there were contrary writings published betwixt <hi>S. German</hi> a common lawyer, and <hi>Sir Thomas More,</hi> about proceeding onely against <hi>heresie ex officio mero;</hi> and without any of those allowed meanes precedent, which (by law) may open a way to such <hi>Enquirie.</hi> These reasons of <hi>Sir Thomas Mores,</hi> the <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> assaieth summarily to answere; and I minde not to defende; further then I finde them coincident with some by me vsed, and not fully answered by him. And the rather, because hauing not <hi>Sir Th. Mores</hi> bookes in readines with me, I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not know how truely they be gathered: &amp; for that proceeding <hi>of office</hi> against other crimes, &amp; vpon allowed grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des by lawe,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19125:133"/>
may stand sound and good; though all that which <hi>Sir Thomas More</hi> defendeth in dealing against <hi>heresie</hi> (without <hi>Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fame, &amp;c:</hi> especially where the penaltie is so grieuous) were to be condemned for vniust and vnequall.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sir Thomas More</hi> in iustification of such proceeding against <hi>heresie,</hi> alledgeth the like course to be holden, in ministring of temporall Iustice, viz. <hi>that Iudges vpon secret information, binde a man to his good abearing, and awarde out a Writ to enquire</hi> De ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stu &amp; fama, <hi>against any man whome they please: and that the Lorde Chaunceller vpon like secret information, putteth men out of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission.</hi> For answere of these, the <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> saith thus: <hi>But they doe not without matter prooued, put a man from his free-holde, or in danger of life, losse of goods, &amp;c: as Ministers be depriued, and put from their freeholde.</hi> By which his answere appeareth, that he yeeldeth these obiections (in facte) to be true: and the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence cannot be denied For if the same course be iust and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable in them; why should it be vnreasonable in others? As for the grieuousnesse of the penaltie surmised to be in the one greater then in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other; this is not material to make it of iust, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iust. For <hi>Magis &amp; minus non variant speciem:</hi> more or lesse makes not things to be of diuers kindes. And what will he say then, against that Criminall proceeding <hi>of Office,</hi> where neither life, free-holde, nor goods is called into question? Shall that then (in his iudgement) be reasonable and iust? Furthermore, what doth this particular recrimination hinder the conueniencie of proceeding <hi>by office?</hi> For doth that course of proceeding teach or require, that men be punished <hi>without any matter proued?</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if this should happen so to be; yet is it onely the personall fault of the men, and not of Law, which establisheth proceeding <hi>ex Officio.</hi> For though an <hi>Accuser</hi> should prosecute; yet the Iudges (if they were so vngodly minded) might <hi>(de facto)</hi> offer this vniustice. Yet this ought not to be any cause to condemne all proceeding by <hi>Accusation,</hi> to be vnreasonable or vnequall.</p>
                     <p>But this is so farre from any tolerable answere vnto those ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections: that it is (in trueth) nothing else, then a very vntrue and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

So that albeit we haue no such Lawe or practise in <hi>England</hi> (thanks be to God, whatsoeuer the <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> saith) to condemne a man, <hi>without any matter proued:</hi> yet some other Churches (whom he &amp; his <hi>Consorts</hi> doe more admire, then their owne) thinke they haue warrant ynough, euen vpon <hi>a fame</hi> and some tokens, to depose a minister, when they shal find that course meete to be vsed.</p>
                     <p>Another reason in that behalfe is alledged by <hi>Sir Th. More;</hi> that the <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Counsel</hi> vpon secret information call men <hi>of Office,</hi> without any prosecutor, vnto examination of matters <hi>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall.</hi> To which the <hi>Notegatherer</hi> answereth thus: viz. that <hi>this
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19125:134"/>
is, in matters concerning the state of the Prince and of the Realme; in matters of allegeance: and that a Iesuite or Seminarie priest may be examined by othe,</hi> quia ipso facto <hi>a traitour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, all the matters that their <hi>Lordships</hi> doe, or may examine, are not of such hie qualitie. And if they were, it is not the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance or hemousnes of the matter, that can make <hi>Iustice</hi> of that, which is <hi>Iniustice</hi> in it selfe; as was touched by me afore. And so be also sundry matters dealt with, in some Courts <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> neerely touching the state of the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Realme.</hi> Besides, it is a very strange allegation to say, The <hi>Iesuits or Seminarie Priests may be examined by othe,</hi> quia ipso facto <hi>traitours.</hi> As if all, or any traitours, might be examined by othe of their treasons; conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that to examine the <hi>partie</hi> by othe, of matters touching losse of his life, or limmes, is flat contrary to the Lawes, policie, and custome of this <hi>Realme</hi> in both sorts of Courts: yea and perhaps contrarie to diuinitie too, as the <hi>Treatisoure</hi> his owne <hi>Camerade</hi> (though fighting in the selfe same quarrell and following the same Coloures) can and doth tell him.</p>
                     <p>That which hath bene said to these two last obiections, may also serue <hi>to retoyne</hi> vnto his <hi>replie,</hi> made against the obiection, that the like course is vsed by <hi>Martiall</hi> Lawe.</p>
                     <p>But if this proceeding <hi>of office</hi> by <hi>Speciall enquirie</hi> be so reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and oftentimes necessarie; how commeth it to passe (may some man aske) that the names of <hi>Inquisition</hi> and <hi>Inquisitours</hi> be holden so odious? Admit those names be odious vnto many: yet this (without further reason) may not serue to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> course it selfe. For many sorts of men be also odious, perhaps without any iust desert or particular abuse in themselues, other then for their office sake, who are not therefore wholly to be reiected: as, <hi>Informers of concealments of poenal statutes, Takers, Purueyers, Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifes errand:</hi> yea and some <hi>administers of Iustice too,</hi> if they be any thing exact &amp; seuere therein. Neither is this odiousnes generall against all <hi>Inquisition</hi> whatsoeuer; but only against one particular course of proceeding thereby in the crime of <hi>heresie</hi> practised in some <hi>Popish</hi> dominions: but of al other most rigorously and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly in <hi>Spaine;</hi> yea (as is supposed) farre beyond their owne <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,</hi> that they haue from the <hi>Pope:</hi> and yet their <hi>Commission</hi> is also in many points exorbitant from all Lawe and reason.</p>

A writer in the <hi>Ciuil</hi> Law assigneth a speciall cause of the hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnes vnto the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon people of the <hi>Spanish Inquisition</hi> for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>heresie.</hi>

                        <hi>Inquisitors of heresie</hi> (saith he) <hi>are hatefull and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected of all Lay-men, because of a long time it hath bene beleeued, that they are wont to proceede vpon most light suspicions, especially a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those that be riche.</hi> Nay in deede how can it be otherwise, seeing their dealing by that <hi>Inquisition</hi> is especially against men of greatest wealth; because vpon their condemnation their goods and lands are confiscated to the house of <hi>Inquisition:</hi> that is, to the <hi>Inquisitours</hi> themselues?</p>
                     <p>Now seeing none of these strange courses be vsed in any <hi>Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall</hi> proceeding in this Realme; there is therefore no iust cause here, to make it hateful vnto any. Yet the <hi>Treatiser</hi> doth imagine this kind of proceeding to be more frequent in Courts <hi>ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> within this Realme in respect of the Iudges owne fees, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by arising. For answere whereof: First in Courts of <hi>Commission Ecclesiasticall</hi> (against which some haue the greatest edge and egernesse) the <hi>Commissioners</hi> haue no fees at all; no not so much as iiij. s. towards their charges, that <hi>Iustices of Peace</hi> be allowed by Statute, at such times as they serue at <hi>Sessions of the Peace, &amp;c:</hi> whereas <hi>Commissioners</hi> are employed, and serue therein freely at their owne charges, with losse of time and intermitting their owne businesse, only of dutie and conscience to her <hi>Maiestie</hi> and to the Common weale. So that if it were not in this respect, the <hi>Commissioners ecclesiasticall</hi> both might and would sit still, with more ease to themselues, and lesse obloquie; howbeit by the worst of euery sort of Subiects.</p>
                     <p>As for Courts of <hi>Ordinaries,</hi> I knowe some of the greatest of them in <hi>England,</hi> that haue not two matters <hi>ex Officio mero</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted in them, in three yeeres space. And for such <hi>ordinarie</hi> Courts as haue some moe causes of that nature: alas, what great fee is it, for the <hi>Iudge ecclesiasticall</hi> to haue iij. pence for a <hi>Citation,</hi> or vj. pence for examination of a witnesse, or vpon an acte of <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,</hi> or such like; to make him desirous (in that respect) to entertaine the cause; seeing hee will hardly be excused with xx. pound charges (that euery such seuerall matter may put him vnto) if an <hi>Appellation</hi> be brought vpon any errour or mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, that may happen to be found, in his proceedings <hi>of Office?</hi>
                        <pb n="95" facs="tcp:19125:135"/>
Besides that, the like fees are due to the <hi>Iudge,</hi> no lesse vpon the prosecution of a <hi>partie,</hi> then they be vpon proceeding <hi>by office:</hi> and therefore none inconuenience heereupon more in the one course (which this opinion alloweth) then there is in the other.</p>
                     <p>Yea, may some say, all prooue not offenders, that be so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and that are thereby put vnto trouble and charges. It is true; yet meet to be called, if the law be obserued in this point, that there must be (afore) a sufficient ground of inducement thereto. Neither doe all those prooue to be offenders, that are prosecuted by a <hi>partie</hi> or by an <hi>Accuser;</hi> and thereby be put to no lesse charges and trouble, euen when (besides the malice of the preferrer) there was no colourable ground of the <hi>accusation.</hi> The like may be also truely said of many others, who be called euen before <hi>temporall Iudges</hi> and <hi>Iustices of the peace,</hi> either by warrant, writte, or otherwise. Yet is this no cause, heereupon wholly to disallow these conuentings. And there is no more reason to finde fault with the fees due vnto the Iudges ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall, in regard that euery one which happeneth to be conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, prooueth not guiltie of the matter imputed to him: then there ought to be with the fees, that are due to Iudges in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Courts for <hi>iudiciall</hi> or <hi>originall</hi> writtes &amp;c. because many of such suites be commenced (as often falleth out in the end) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good matter on the Plaintifs or Informers behalfe. Thus much in answere to the obiections made against the reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse, and conueniencie of proceeding <hi>by Office.</hi>

then, in <note n="1" place="margin">Changed by the statute, 28. H. 8.</note> most <hi>Dioecesses</hi> of this realme, tithes of vacant benefices were due to them.</p>
                     <p>In the writ of <hi>Consultation</hi> alleaged afore out of the 57. page of the <hi>Register</hi> for allowing proceeding <hi>ex Officio</hi> against a fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: it is <note n="2" place="margin">Reg. pag. 57.

                     </p>
                     <p>But it may perhaps be sayd, that great abuse may hereupon folow, if the <hi>Iudge</hi> list to vexe a man wrongfully: for he may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend strong <hi>Euidence</hi> and <hi>Information</hi> or a <hi>common fame</hi> to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst a man, or such like afore shewed, whereof he is crediblie aduertised. Well, if it be but so much, that the <hi>ecclesiasticall Iudge</hi> (when he is called by his superiour) must be able to make proofe of some such: it is more then a <hi>Iudge</hi> or <hi>Iustice</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> neede shew, why he calleth any man into question, or bindeth him to the peace, or to the good behauiour. And what lawes can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uised, but they may be abused? whatsoeuer hath an vse, hath also an abuse, sauing vertue, saieth <note n="3" place="margin">Aristot. in Rhetoric.</note> 
                        <hi>Aristotle.</hi> Yet if he be an <hi>Ordinarie</hi> (as hath bin aforeshewed) such grounds of his proceeding must appeare in Acts <hi>Iudiciallie,</hi> or be well prooued: or else (vpon an <hi>Appellation)</hi> his proceeding is to be refourmed.</p>
                     <p>Besides, is it not more probable that a <hi>Partie</hi> which will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, shall doe it of malice to vexe oftentimes an innocent, and to bring him into perill; then a <hi>Iudge</hi> who reapeth no commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereby, but satisfaction of his duetie? and is not he more like to deale in these causes with sinceritie, then <hi>quilibet è vulgo?</hi> yet by this opinion, such are permitted to <hi>accuse</hi> and to preferre mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter against any, though no <hi>fame</hi> nor other matter, no not so much as <hi>suspicion</hi> doe appeare against them.</p>
                     <p>Is it not then all one, whether the innocent man be wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully vexed by the <hi>Iudge,</hi> or by a priuate person, who (in a maner)
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:19125:139"/>
professeth, that he doeth it of malice? neuerthelesse for all this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience and abuse that may happen, it will not be thought conuenient (I trust) to damme vp the way from euery man both <hi>Iudge</hi> &amp; <hi>partie,</hi> to preferre suites against offenders. For if it should so be, in short time there would bee neither <hi>Iudge</hi> nor other, but lewd persons onely; and they might liue as they list.</p>
                     <p>Yea, but it seemeth vnreasonable (will some man say) that a man should be called into question and not to know his <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser.</hi> Surelie if the way of proceeding by <hi>Accusation</hi> be taken, he is to know him: but when by <hi>Enquirie,</hi> though for the most part the <hi>Denouncer</hi> is knowen, yet there be many weightie and very considerable causes, why euen <hi>witnesses</hi> in cause of heresie: and much lesse those that gaue the information, should not bee knowen; which euerie man of himselfe, without rehearsall, can weie and call to mind.</p>
                     <p>Besides, this obiection maketh nothing against all proceeding <hi>ex officio.</hi> For when it is grounded and instituted vpon a <hi>Present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> by <hi>officers</hi> speciallie appointed, their names are knowen to him whose processe is made. Yet I must tell you, that hereby it commeth oft times to passe, that meane men in parishes abroad, and for very foule crimes, do rather make choise to be bold with their oath and conscience, then with a delinquent, whom they haue some occasion to feare.</p>
                     <p>But (I pray) what necessitie is there (in Iustice) of knowing the <hi>Relatours?</hi> may not a <hi>Iurie</hi> endite a man without any cause openly appearing, as when the matter is either knowen to some of them aforehand, or the <hi>Euidence</hi> (as some times happeneth) is not giuen openlie? which cases happening; the partie endited shall neuer know who gaue the <hi>information,</hi> because they are sworne to keepe secret the <hi>Queenes,</hi> their owne, &amp; their felowes counsell. Which course for the trouble of the partie supposed to be delinquent, doeth amount to as much, as if the Iudge <hi>ex officio mero</hi> had done it.</p>
                     <p>When the <hi>Lords of the Counsell</hi> haue a supposed malefactor in examination, are they bound in <hi>Iustice,</hi> or were it but good poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to signifie vnto him, who it is that giues the information; and to confront them together at first dash? but howsoeuer these (by circumstances) should be thought fit to be caried, it is neither to
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:19125:140"/>
nor fro, to the condemnation of all proceeding vpon the <hi>office</hi> of the Iudges onely, as vniust, whether a man know or be ignorant, who made the <hi>Denunciation.</hi>

Secondly, that <hi>the inditement goeth to particular matter, &amp; it must be certaine.</hi> And so do articles also in a court <hi>ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>that they which indite him, shall not be Iudges of him nor arraigne him.</hi> No more shall they who <hi>present or denounce</hi> a man to an <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> Iudge, be Iudges of him: and therefore (whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> say to the contrarie) it is not <hi>aliter ex officio.</hi> Fourthly, that <hi>Iudges in such a case are to proceed circumspectlie.</hi> And so must they doe in other cases as well as this: and so must <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> Iudges also. Fiftlie, <hi>that two witnesses must be at the arraignment, vnlesse the partie willingly confesse the same.</hi> And so it is in courts ecclesiastical. For without the parties confession, or two witnesses; none may be absolutely conuicted. And yet this which he here saieth, is not generall in all <hi>arraignments.</hi> For the statute <note n="1" place="margin">1. Edw. 6. c. 12.</note> made the 1. yeere of K. <hi>Edward</hi> the 6. (which hereunto he vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth) mentioneth to this purpose onely treason and misprision thereof. The said statute is also repealed since by Q. <hi>Mary.</hi> The other statute <note n="2" place="margin">1 &amp; 2. Ph. &amp; Mar. cap. 10.</note> 
                        <hi>1 &amp; 2.</hi> of <hi>Philip</hi> &amp; <hi>Mary,</hi> that he alleageth, is onely for such triall of treasons, that be made treasons by that <hi>Act.</hi> For
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:19125:140"/>
the self same <hi>Act</hi> doth appoint, <hi>all other trials of treason to be made according to the due order &amp; course of the Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lawes.</hi> But though it were so, that at all trials two witnesses should of necessitie be present: &amp; though it were admitted, that his other foure answers were true in fact, &amp; that the courses of proceedings ecclesiastical were to the contrary: yet these do not any way impugne or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw sir <hi>Th. Mores</hi> reason, viz. <hi>that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may be endited, &amp; not know who gaue the euidence or preferred it; in like sort as some know not who preferred vp matter of crime against them into courts ecclesiasticall,</hi> and therefore this must needs be wholy impertinent, and besides the purpose.</p>
                     <p>Vnto another reason of sir <hi>Th. Mores</hi> (grounded also vpon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance of the practise at the <hi>Common</hi> law, vnto the <hi>ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> in this behalfe) viz. <hi>that a man may be at that law arrested and imprisoned, onely vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> suspicion:</hi> he frameth two answers. The first of them is, <hi>that at the common law there must be a fact precedent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a cause of suspicion must be grounded: otherwise, there lieth an actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of false imprisonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.</hi> What? If an offence appeare to be done, shal this be sufficient (without all peril) to ground a suspicion against any man whomsoeuer, that it was he which did it, &amp; so to impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son him? Neither yet is it generall, <hi>that a fact must be precedent,</hi> before a man be arrested. For if it be a fact of such qualitie &amp; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as leaueth traces &amp; signes after it; as murder, Coining, and such like, which be called by <hi>Ciuilians, facta permanentia;</hi> in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is true that a fact must be precedent. But in such facts, as leaue no such traces behind them, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is not certain whether they be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And these are called <hi>facta transeuntia.</hi> Neuerthelesse, this is not in any sort, an answere vnto sir <hi>Th. Mores</hi> reason. For admit that a fact must alwayes be precedent: neuer the later this remaineth true, that <hi>a Iustices onely suspicion may serue to arrest and imprison a man.</hi> And yet the law ecclesiasticall (for which <hi>More</hi> reasoneth) doth in trueth require stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger grounds for <hi>enquitie special,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Iudges</hi> only <hi>suspicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> as is afore at large in this seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d part declared.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Note-gatherers</hi> later answere vnto that reason of <hi>Mores
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:19125:141"/>
is; that a felonie or murder being done, and a fact manifest, the partie apprehended and suspected, knoweth that he is to answere that facte, and not other by-wayes, as is vsed in the ecclesiasticall proceedings.</hi> Trulie, of all that euer I heard, these answeres be <hi>by-wayes,</hi> and besides all way too, of any reasonable answering obiections. It may be that the partie himselfe (especiallie if he be not guiltie) knoweth not (till hee be asked) the very particular cause of his apprehension.</p>
                     <p>But it will be sayd, that vpon his examination, hee learneth what it is. Why sir, and so doe all that be conuented in courtes <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> know by their examination, the matter obiected. Then where is the difference and the <hi>by-way</hi> that this man so tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of? But will you see his clerkelie vayne of reasoning here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? For it is, as if he had gathered it thus: viz. <hi>A man arrested, knoweth that he is to answere a fact which is committed:</hi> Ergo, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit at the common lawe a man may bee arrested vpon suspicion: yet proceeding</hi> ex Officio <hi>is vnlawfull, how good grounds soeuer there be for it, farre sounder then suspicion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For another inconuenience of proceeding <hi>by office,</hi> importing with all a <hi>Contrarietie</hi> to the lawes of the Realme, the <hi>Note-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therer</hi> assigneth; that <hi>thereby the Accessarie may be punished, and the principall may escape; which is contrarie to the Common law.</hi> The consequence hereof he goeth about to prooue thus: For that (as he saieth) <hi>the Principall may (in those courtes) be an Informer and a witnesse both against the Accessarie.</hi> By which saying, his slender skill or experience in those lawes appeareth. For it is most notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that there is no better nor more vsuall chalenge &amp; exception against an Informer or witnesse; then to alleage <hi>quod est particeps vel socius criminis praetensi.</hi> Albeit euen at the <hi>Common lawe,</hi> we v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually see partakers and complices in <hi>coining,</hi> in other kindes of <hi>treason,</hi> and for sundry hainous crimes (especially which are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly contriued) to be admitted to appeach and to be witnesses, and to giue euidence against others their partners.</p>
                     <p>He affirmeth also, but maketh no shew of proofe thereof; <hi>that hereby the two Iurisdictions be confounded; and that proceeding of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice is derogatorie to the lawes, liberties, and customes of England.</hi> In which respect, it is sufficient that these be as easilie by vs denied, as they be barelie, boldly, and vntruly by him auouched.</p>

He further allegeth in three places (as if it were a matter very considerable) out of <hi>Hall,</hi> and the <hi>Actes and Monuments of the Church,</hi> that by the statute of <hi>25. H. 8. cap. 14.</hi> all proceeding <hi>of Office</hi> is repealed; and calleth the statute against <hi>Heresie, 1. H. 4.</hi> the statute <hi>ex officio,</hi> as if it had bene vnknowen before. First, that very statute <note n="1" place="margin">1. Eliz. cap. 1.</note> it selfe of <hi>H. 8.</hi> standeth repealed. Secondly, it is very vntrue, that it did at any time repeale proceeding <hi>of Office.</hi> For it doth not so much, as once mention it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what any writers do name the sayd statute of <hi>H. 4.</hi> thereby repealed, as I haue not sought, so is it not materiall; seeing they misunderstand it, if they so write. Yea, the <hi>Notegatherer</hi> himselfe yeeldeth, that the sayd statute of <hi>K. H. 8.</hi> doth establish procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>of Office,</hi> if he vnderstand what himselfe writeth. For it doth appoint (and so he allegeth it) that from thenceforth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings against <hi>Heretikes</hi> should be vpon <hi>accusation</hi> or <hi>present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> If vpon <hi>Presentment,</hi> then of consequence by the <hi>Iudges Office.</hi> For so all lawes testifie; and <hi>Presenters</hi> be not <hi>Accusers</hi> or <hi>parties.</hi> For they are seuered &amp; counter-diuided euen in that very place, one against the other.</p>
                     <p>The principall drift of that statute of <hi>K. H. 8.</hi> was to prouide, that an <hi>Ordinarie</hi> vpon his owne onely <hi>suspicion</hi> should not call men into the dangerous question of <hi>heresie,</hi> as (it seemeth) was afore vsed by some of them vpon colour of that statute <hi>1. H. 4.</hi> and therefore there repealed.</p>
                     <p>The next statute, which to the same purpose he quoteth, <note n="2" place="margin">31. H. 8. ca. 14.</note> is so farre from impugning proceeding <hi>of Office;</hi> that for grounding proceeding ecclesiasticall euen in the <hi>crime of heresie,</hi> it proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth besides <hi>Accusation</hi> and <hi>Presentment,</hi> not onely <hi>information</hi> by two witnesses; but also <hi>enquirie,</hi> and that is alwayes <hi>of Office.</hi> But do not these men draw neere the lees, when they are driuen thus to allege the statute of <hi>Sixe Articles</hi> (being also repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led) against proceeding <hi>of Office?</hi> I had thought their courage in the pretended cause of sinceritie, had bene so great; that they would rather haue quit the place, with losse of their cause, then once to haue borrowed so much as the shadow of a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon, out of that store house.</p>
                     <p>Against this course the <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> also allegeth certeine bookes printed in king <hi>Henrie</hi> the eights dayes <hi>Cum priuilegio.</hi>
                        <pb n="108" facs="tcp:19125:142"/>
These hee termeth to be <hi>the maner of debating that cause in those dayes.</hi> The first was made by <hi>S. German</hi> (as it is thought) and is intituled, <hi>The diuision of the Spiritualtie and Temporaltie:</hi> with his replie against <hi>Sir Thomas Moore,</hi> intituled <hi>Salem and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance.</hi> The next, <hi>concerning the power of the cleargie and lawes of the Realme.</hi> The third intituled, <hi>Of the liberties of the clergie collected out of the lawes of the Realme by Iohn Goodall,</hi> and printed by <hi>Robert Wier,</hi> but without priuilege. And the last, <hi>Marsilij Patauini Defensor Pacis</hi> in <hi>English,</hi> with the <hi>Kinges</hi> and her <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties</hi> mothers armes; which (belike) hee mentioneth, that they may stand in stead of <hi>priuilege.</hi> But will you see, what great and strong debating there was of this matter, by the sayd foure bookes? Truely, sauing in the first of them, there is not a word mentioned against proceeding <hi>of Office.</hi> And in <hi>Goodalles</hi> booke, by sundrie places thereof (as is else-where in this <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie</hi> alleged) this kinde of proceeding is plainely auouched to be a <hi>Libertie of the Clergie,</hi> giuen vnto them by the lawes of the Realme.</p>
                     <p>And all that is sayd in that one booke <note n="1" place="margin">Of diuision be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raltie and spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altie. cap. 7.</note> and one onely place thereof, is no more but thus, worde by worde; <hi>viz. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cause of diuision, for that diuers suites haue bene taken</hi> ex offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio; <hi>so that the parties haue not knowen, who haue accused them: and thereupon they haue bene caused to abiure in cause of heresie, sometime to doe penance, and to pay great summes of money for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming. Which vexation they thought came by the Iudges and the Officers.</hi> Therefore the fault that hee then found, was not the very proceeding <hi>of Office;</hi> but for that it was handled in such sort, that the partie knew not who gaue the information, which he calleth <hi>Accusing;</hi> and for that it was in cause of <hi>heresie:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a crime of farre more important danger to the partie, then any other offence <hi>Ecclesiasticall:</hi> yet not challenging the very proceeding thereby for vnlawfull, but as being (with such cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances) some cause of <hi>diuision</hi> betweene the two states, as he surmised. The soundnesse of which iudgement I minde not here to examine.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> vrgeth further, that the Popish bishops were depriued in king <hi>Edward</hi> the sixt his time, by <hi>Accusation</hi> or <hi>Presentment;</hi> though (as it seemeth) hee knoweth not by
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19125:142"/>
whether of them. But what if they at that time had bene pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded with otherwise then <hi>of Office?</hi> Woulde this prooue all proceeding <hi>of Office</hi> to be contrarie to the lawes of <hi>England;</hi> which is his drift and purpose? Yet I haue often shewed afore, that <hi>Presentment</hi> is a preparatorie course peculiar onely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>by speciall enquirie of office.</hi> But for plaine proofe in fact, that they were in deed proceeded with <hi>ex officio Iudicum;</hi> I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre me to the actes <hi>iudiciall</hi> of their depriuation yet remaning, and to that also which I haue written in a certeine chapter of the third part of this booke.</p>
                     <p>Heere it will not be vnseasonable to admonish the Reader once for all of a palpable <note n="1" place="margin">Aduertisement of an errour.</note> mistaking both of the <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> and <hi>Treatisour</hi> in a materiall point; who by the whole course of their writings and titles of their bookes, seeme to imagine, proceeding <hi>ex Officio</hi> to signifie nothing els, then <hi>ministring of an oath to the suspected partie in a cause criminall:</hi> Whereas (in verie trueth) there may be some proceeding <hi>of Office,</hi> though that oath be not at all vrged or vsed; yea and where it ought not to be imposed, though it were vrged. Like as on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie side, there may be proceeding euen by way of <hi>Accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> where the oath may and ought to be exacted for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties purgation: perhappes burthened by great probabilities, yet not being so pregnant, as to conuict him. And therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all colour of reason, and ignorantlie doe they and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers (as the late <hi>Petitioner</hi> to her <hi>Maiestie)</hi> confound pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>of Office,</hi> with ministring of an <hi>oath,</hi> being but one Act thereof: which is in deed sometimes, but not alwayes, no; nor yet alonely vsed in that course of proceeding. Neuerthelesse, taking it whether way they lust, the sayd <hi>Popish bishops</hi> were in trueth proceeded with <hi>of Office,</hi> though <hi>denounced</hi> by certeine, and (as is expreslie set downe of some of them) were vrged, and did answere the Articles obiected vpon their <hi>corporall oathes;</hi> which (by lawe) they needed not, and therefore (as it is likely) would not haue done, if the <hi>Denunciatours</hi> had beene <hi>parties.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To prooue this course to be against law, he allegeth also out of a booke made <note n="2" place="margin">Defence of Priests marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. pag. 175.</note> by <hi>D.

                        <hi>Queene Marie) chargeth the ecclesiasticall Ordinaries to put in execution the Canons and Ecclesiasticall lawes, none other but such, as were vsed in the time of king</hi> Henrie <hi>the eight. And com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeth also moreouer, that those should no further be put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, but as they may stand with the lawes and statutes of the land.</hi> What then? <hi>Ergo,</hi> all proceeding <hi>of Office</hi> (though continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie practiced in sundrie matters in both their reignes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradiction) <hi>is contrarie to the Lawes of the Realme?</hi> Truely, if there be one <hi>methode</hi> of sound reasoning (as <hi>Ramus</hi> holdeth concerning teaching of Artes) I would be sorie this kinde of disputing should be it. For I haue not bene taught, nor shall euer learne (I thinke) either to reason thus, or to put such <hi>Enthymemata</hi> into true <hi>Syllogismes; viz. Such Canons onely were then to be put in execution, as might stand with the lawes of the Realme.</hi> Ergo, <hi>proceeding</hi> of Office <hi>is contrarie to the lawes of the Realme.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His last allegation (falling into this place to be discussed) that he bringeth in maymed also, to prooue this proceeding to be against the lawes of <hi>England,</hi> is out of one of her <hi>Maiesties Iniunctions,</hi> 
                        <note n="1" place="margin">Iniunction. 50.</note> 
                        <hi>Against slanderous and infamous wordes,</hi> which is thus <hi>verbatim: viz. Her Maiestie straitly commandeth all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner her subiects, to forbeare all vaine and contentious disputations in matters of religion: and not to vse in despight or rebuke of any person, these conuicious wordes,</hi> Papist <hi>or</hi> Papisticall heretike, Schismatike, <hi>or</hi> Sacramentarie; <hi>or any such like wordes of reproch: But if any maner of person shall deserue the accusation of any such; that first he be charitablie admonished thereof: and if that shall not amend him, then to denounce the offender to the</hi> Ordinarie, <hi>or to some higher power, hauing authoritie to correct the same.</hi> But what (I pray) can be gathered hereof, more then a care to reteine priuate persons in a charitable course, one towardes another, without reprochfull wordes, vpon any differences of opinions? Or doth this reach to the abrogating of any course of proceeding? Nay, rather it doeth establish it, seeing vpon <hi>Denunciation</hi> (which is heere mentioned) proceeding <hi>of Office</hi> may be grounded, but not <hi>Accusation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Treatiser</hi> saith that <hi>heereby the same man is Iudge and Accuser: which is contrary to the policy of this Realme, that suffereth

not an Accusor to be a witnesse, nor an Enditour to be a Iuror for triall of the fact.</hi> I answer, that the first is vntrue. For that which ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth way to the Iudges <hi>Enquirie</hi> is holden (by Lawe) as the <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusour,</hi> and not the <hi>Iudge.</hi> Touching the second, I haue shewed out of statutes, that <hi>witnesses</hi> be called <hi>Accusors:</hi> therefore that is not contrary to the policie of the <hi>Realme:</hi> and yet is it contrary to <hi>Ciuill</hi> and <hi>Canon</hi> Lawes.

iudgeth euen an <hi>Accusour</hi> not to be wanting in such procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, for that <note n="1" place="margin">Prae. Millei. fol. 3. nu. 31.</note> 
                        <hi>in euery Crime, Fiscus est Accusator,</hi> the common interest is the <hi>Accusour:</hi> and it is so farre from being a course disallowed by that Lawe, that <note n="2" place="margin">Angel. de ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lef. ver. haec est quaedam. &amp; ibi Aug. in addit. a. nu. 12. vsque ad 48.</note> 
                        <hi>(albeit there were no such cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome at all) yet there be very many cases, wherein by the very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse disposition of that lawe, the Iudge may proceede</hi> ex Officio. Nay it is thus testified by a great Lawyer, that <note n="3" place="margin">Io. Andr. in add. Specul. tit. de Inquisitione. §. quando autem.</note> 
                        <hi>in any case what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer euen by the Ciuill lawe, it is permitted to the Iudge to proceede of Office, and so by way of Enquirie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And this is receiued, not onely in publicke and popular mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanours, but also in priuate offences. <hi>For</hi>

                        <hi>in these (without either complaint or Accusation) the Iudge may proceede of Office by way of Enquirie. Albeit the Lawe set not downe for such, any certaine (either corporall or pecuniarie) penaltie; for then such an offendour is punishable, by some extraordinary penaltie. The reason of this proceeding in priuate Crimes is, the very interest, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth hath, to haue such offences punished.</hi> By reason of which common interest, <note n="5" place="margin">Bald. in l. 1. C. qui accusare non possunt.</note> euen where there is an <hi>Accuser,</hi> yet <hi>if hee be away, the Iudge</hi> ex Officio <hi>may proceed and go on in the cause.

The like is to be saide when the <hi>partie</hi> wil collude with the <note n="6" place="margin">Bartolus in l. inter omnes §. rectè ff. de furtis.</note> malefactour: for <hi>if he that was robbed will collude with the thiefe, and say hee was not robbed: yet if there be likelyhood to the contrary, the partie is not beleeued, but the Iudge proceedeth</hi> ex Officio, quia interest Reipub. puniri furtum.</p>

                        <hi>the ordinarie paine appointed by Lawe, is not to be inflicted vpon proceeding of Office.</hi> But they also make these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions: viz. that this doth not holde, <note n="8" place="margin">Innoc in d. ca.</note>

For in these cases they affirme that the very ordinarie paine (expressed in the Law) may be imposed. But it is assured, <note n="11" place="margin">Clarus lib. 5. § fin. qu. 49.</note> that <hi>by Custome at both these Lawes not onely a milder paine, but the very set paine of Lawe it selfe may be inflicted, euen when a Iudge hath proceeded of Office.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But here some may obiect, that those Lawes do seeme some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to require an <hi>Accuser.</hi> It is true: but neither alwayes, nor of necessitie, as hath bene opened. And it is shewed afore,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:19125:145"/>
that publike interest stands in steede of an <hi>Accuser.</hi> Likewise the <note n="1" place="margin">c. qualiter &amp; quando cl. 2. de accusat.</note> Lawe accounteth <hi>fame</hi> precedent to be a <hi>kinde of Accuser.</hi> And where <hi>fame</hi> wanteth, other <note n="2" place="margin">Bartol. in l. congruit. ff. de Off. praesidis.</note> presumptions, and <hi>Indicia or euidences are (in this behalfe) equiualent vnto a fame.</hi>

                     <p>It may further perhaps be vrged, that by <hi>Ciuill</hi> lawe, this <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie ex officio,</hi> is counted an extraordinarie remedie.

                        <hi>Enquirie of office is specially permitted either by Lawe</hi> (as in many cases) <hi>or by statute, there it is as ordinarie a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die as Accusation.</hi> And by the <note n="4" place="margin">Ibid. nu. 48.</note> 
                        <hi>Canon</hi> Lawe, it is absolutely <hi>an ordinarie remedie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I haue also heard it to haue bene obiected against this course, that bad and infamous persons suggestions haue bene accepted. If it be so, it is but the fault of persons, not of the Lawe. And if by an <hi>Appellation</hi> from any <hi>ordinarie</hi> Court, this point come to ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering; it wil not be found absolutely iustifiable. yet experience teacheth, that not onely <hi>Relatours</hi> (that be <hi>infamous</hi> and bad per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons) be in some cases admitted by the Lawes of this <hi>Realme,</hi> but (which is more) they are permitted also to be <hi>witnesses.</hi> As both <hi>infamous</hi> persons, and those that be partakers with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached in treasons, murders, and felonies: which is permitted in fauour of the <hi>Prince</hi> and common wealth, in detestation of such grieuous crimes, and for the very nature of the crimes, which are (for the most part) so perfourmed; as none honest persons, but such as themselues, are or can be priuie vnto them.</p>
                     <p>Vpon the same grounds, the <hi>Ciuil</hi> Law also admitteth the like witnesses. Therefore is it testified to be <note n="4" place="margin">Decius con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silio 342. nu. 8.</note> 
                        <hi>the common opinion of writers in that Law, that for the horriblenes of some crimes, witnesses otherwise disabled in Law, may be receiued, as in here sie and in Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. Also when the trueth of the matter cannot otherwise bee had: therefore the rule is, that when the facte is of such qualitie, that other

witnesses cannot by any possibilitie be had, in such case those shalbe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that are in other cases forbidden by lawe.</hi> Therefore none of these, nor any such like friuolous obiections, will be able to ouerthrowe this course so manifoldly grounded both vpon those former seuerall lawes, and also vpon reason.</p>

Neuerthelesse, we finde in the bookes of termes and yeeres, many things reported out of the <hi>Ciuill</hi> and <hi>Canon</hi> lawes; yea &amp; many rules taken out of them, which are there both alledged and allowed of. That sage and prudent <hi>Senate,</hi> with the whole people of <hi>Rome,</hi> when of <hi>twelue Tables</hi> (which conteined the ground of all their lawes) tenne of them were transcribed &amp; taken out of the lawes of sundry com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon weales then in <hi>Greece:</hi> they neither helde it any disparage to their owne Nation; nor in that respect accounted them the lesse to be <hi>Romane</hi> lawes.</p>
                     <p>Though it were graunted, that the proceeding <hi>of office</hi> in Courtes <hi>Ciuil</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> with vs, was drawen at first from those two lawes: yet the same or like proceeding, which is vsed in sundry <hi>temporall</hi> Courtes here; perhaps will not be iudged to haue bin taken and borrowed from those two lawes; but rather to haue bin the very olde originall custome and <hi>Common</hi> lawe of the land. Which consideration (if it be true) must needes (in mine opinion) make much for the approuing of the reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and equitie of that proceeding: when as seuerall nations, by
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:19125:146"/>

                     <p>It is warely said by him, that <hi>it is to be proued;</hi> because as yet it is not done.

                     <p>Vnto this Chapter are many of those quotations to be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which the <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> hath mustered and thronged toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in his first title, which is this, viz. <hi>testimonies out of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fathers, that doe mislike the proceeding ex officio, and othe nowe vsed.</hi> But like as many of them be altogether mutes, both in the one point and the other: so sundry of them that are compelled to giue euidence and to say somewhat; doe not once mention an othe; yet happely speake somewhat of <hi>Inquirie</hi> or <hi>Accasation.</hi> Yea, and his maine conclusion, which he propoundeth vnto him selfe in that title to prooue, reacheth no further, nor is otherwise then thus: <hi>Inquisitio ab imperatoribus prohibita.</hi> Such of them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore belong to this disputatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

true; and yet neither the <hi>parties oath</hi> in a <hi>criminall</hi> cause any whit impeached; nor all proceeding <hi>of office</hi> thereby disallowed.

                        <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> in the place by him quoted, but not alledged (for he alledgeth no place at all in that whole title) saith thus: <hi>Traianus the Emperour writ backe to Plinius Secundus, Christianos profide nullatenus inquirendos: that Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s for that they beleeued, should</hi> not at all <hi>be enquired after, or sought for.</hi> To the like effect <hi>Tertullian</hi>

                     <p>Now because in fauor of the <hi>Christians,</hi> these seuerall <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> did command aswell that they should not be <hi>accused,</hi> as <hi>Traian</hi> did that they should not be <hi>enquired</hi> after &amp; sought vp: shall we therefore hereupon gather, that neither <hi>accusation</hi> nor <hi>inquisition</hi> might be vsed by the law of the <hi>Romanes</hi> against any offenders? or that these ancient fathers (which report the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked of both those proceedings, and so (vpon the matter) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned all proceeding &amp; punishing of any offenders whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer?

But I can by no meanes endure it, that they should be put to death, onely vpon the petitions and out-cries of the multitude.</hi> But this hath no kinde of shew, either against <hi>Accusation</hi> or <hi>Enquirie of Office.</hi> For it condemneth only the mercilesse and cruell iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of some Deputies; who to gratifie the clamorous common people, were contented to execute the poore <hi>Christians</hi> without any proofs.</p>

And for specification of such contrarieties as he surmiseth to be in <hi>bishops</hi> proceedings against those alleged <hi>Canons,</hi> he first sayth; that <hi>their oath is not abiurationis</hi> or <hi>purgationis.</hi> It is true, that besides these two, some oathes which they minister, are <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis dicendae,</hi> vpon the crime <hi>enquired</hi> of.

                     <p>The next contrarietie vnto them he assigneth, <note n="2" place="margin">c. accusatus. de haeret. in 6.

For they may not deale in matters, that are not <hi>committed</hi> to them, any more vpon <hi>Accusation,</hi> then they may do by way of <hi>Enquirie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third contrariety surmised by him to be in <hi>Bishops</hi> procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings against the <hi>Canons</hi> 
                        <note n="3" place="margin">c. statuta. de haeret. in 6.</note> is; that they suffer not <hi>publication</hi> to be made of the witnesses depositions: which is a meere slander, without any colour of truth. Neuerthelesse, when by <hi>publication</hi> of the witnesses names that haue deposed in matter of <hi>heresie,</hi> great perill might grow vnto them through the friends of the impeached, or otherwise: in that case only the <hi>Canons</hi> (with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine moderation and cautions) do permit (vpon the Iudges dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion) the names of the witnesses to be suppressed from the defendant, and to be kept from being published abroad at all.</p>

sometimes are vnproperly termed <hi>Accusers,</hi> as I haue afore shewed.

Let vs see then, whether they retained <hi>Accusation</hi> as the onely lawfull course.</p>
                     <p>It is true, <note n="1" place="margin">Mat. 27. <abbr>V.</abbr> 12.

                        <hi>thus: then said they, what neede we any further wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses? for we haue heard it of his owne mouth.</hi> Whereby it is made manifest, that albeit the <hi>Priestes</hi> and other <hi>Elders,</hi> sought by all meanes possible (outwardly) to approue their proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Christ</hi> vnto <hi>Pilate</hi> and the people: yet did they neuer seeke or require any third person, to preferre vp <hi>Accusation</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him: and therefore a course of proceeding not of necessity to be obserued by Gods law, as they al then conceiued &amp; vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood it. Likewise when the first martyr <hi>S.

                        <hi>witnesses</hi> only were vsed For though the <hi>Libertines</hi> &amp; <hi>Cyrenia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> (vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> spite toward <hi>Steue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>)</hi> did suborne the <hi>witnesses,</hi> yet did they not appeare themselues openly in the action, as <hi>Accusers.</hi> Neuerthelesse it bare the shew at first of a <note n="8" place="margin">Ibid. <abbr>V.</abbr> 15.</note> due and <hi>Iudicial</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in <hi>Councill,</hi> howsoeuer the <hi>execution</hi> of him after was done without iudgement giuen, and <note n="9" place="margin">Act. 7. <abbr>V.</abbr> 57, 58, 59.</note> by tumult of the people.</p>
                     <p>Nowe least any man should surmise, that this was but a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt custome crept into those later times; we will therfore looke something higher, what was done in former ages.</p>
                     <p>In the proceeding against <hi>Naboth,</hi> though it was a most wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked iudgement, grounded vpon <hi>periury</hi> and <hi>subornation,</hi> yet we may <note n="10" place="margin">1. Reg. cap. 21. <abbr>V.</abbr> 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.</note> see, the plot was so laid, as it might seeme to cary apre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of a due <hi>Iudiciall</hi> course; whereupon may be truely gathered
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:19125:152"/>
something touching the maner of proceeding then vsed. For in a solemne fast, when <hi>Naboth</hi> sate <hi>Iudicially</hi> with the rest of the <hi>Elders,</hi> and chiefe of the people; vpon the onely witnessing of two wicked men in his presence (that he blasphemed God and the king) <hi>Naboth</hi> was condemned to be stoned.</p>
                     <p>The matter for which I note it, is this: that the processe was without any <hi>Accuser</hi> or party. For there are named onely the <hi>witnesses, the elders, and gouernours,</hi> &amp; <hi>Naboth the party condemned.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By which, (together with the historie of the adulteresse <note n="1" place="margin">Ioh. 8. cap. 10.</note> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Gospel, being conferred with <note n="2" place="margin">Deut. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>Deuteronomie)</hi> I do gather; that ostentimes, in their <hi>Iudiciall</hi> proceedings, the <hi>Iewes</hi> had none other persons that any way dealt, but <hi>witnesses, Iudges,</hi> and the <hi>party</hi> against whom they proceeded. For in the Gospel, albeit those that told <hi>Christ</hi> of the womans adultery, are <note n="3" place="margin">Ioh. 8. <abbr>V.</abbr> 10.</note> called <hi>Accusers</hi> in these wordes, <hi>Where be those thine accusers?</hi> yet such of <note n="4" place="margin">Verse 7.</note> them as <hi>were without sinne, were willed by him, to cast the first stone at her:</hi> Alluding therein to that lawe, <note n="5" place="margin">Deut. 17. <abbr>V.</abbr> 7.</note> that <hi>the hands of the witnesses, shalbe first vpon an offendour condemned, to kill him.</hi> So that there were none other <hi>Accusers,</hi> but the witnesses.</p>
                     <p>This is more plainely proued out of the same booke <note n="6" place="margin">Deut. ca. 19. <abbr>V.</abbr> 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.</note> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes. For where it is saide, that <hi>one witnesse shall not rise against a man for any trespasse, or for any sinne, or for any fault that he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendeth in, but in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall the matter be established:</hi> it is foorthwith added thus: <hi>If a false witnesse rise vp against a man to accuse him of trespasse: then both the men which striue together, shall stand before the Lord, euen before the Priests and the Iudges, which shall be in those dayes, and the Iudges shall make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent inquisition: and if the witnesse be found false, and hath giuen false witnesse against his brother, then shall ye doe vnto him, as he had thought to doe vnto his brother.</hi> Whereby may appeare that he that is said to <hi>accuse,</hi> is termed a <hi>witnesse</hi> three times, and his falsehood is to be found out by the <hi>Iudges inquisition.</hi> This also appeareth more plainely by the story <note n="7" place="margin">Dan. 13. <abbr>V.</abbr> 34, 40, &amp; 62.</note> of <hi>Susanna,</hi> where the <hi>Elders</hi> were witnesses, and there were none other <hi>Accusers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So in the <note n="8" place="margin">Deu. cap. 21. <abbr>V.</abbr> 18, 19, &amp;c.</note> condemnation of a <hi>disobedient sonne,</hi> there is none other <hi>Accuser,</hi> but the very parents that make the <hi>complaint,</hi> and beare witnesse also.</p>
                     <p>So that we finde in Scripture, proceedings <hi>of office,</hi> grounded
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:19125:153"/>
vpon <hi>Denunciation</hi> of one person, vpon heare-say, vpon suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, and vpon <hi>Notorietie</hi> of the fact, aswell by <hi>Iudges Ciuill</hi> or <hi>Temporall,</hi> adiudging vnto a temporall punishment, &amp; by Iudges being both <hi>Ciuill</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> and by <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> alone, inflicting the like penalty: as also by <hi>ecclesiasticall Iudges,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to censures <hi>ecclesiasticall,</hi> without any <hi>accusation</hi> or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to prosecute, other then the <hi>Iudges</hi> themselues. And therefore criminal proceeding <hi>of office,</hi> (&amp; consequently without <hi>Accuser)</hi> and likewise without any <hi>solemne presentment;</hi> is by manifolde examples of Scripture, sufficiently approued for lawfull &amp; godly.</p>

Yet alwayes both before and after, this they obserued: that when there was any that woulde be <hi>Accuser</hi> or <hi>partie</hi> seriously, without <hi>collusion:</hi> there the <hi>Iudge</hi> neuer <hi>enquired ex Officio:</hi> for <hi>vbi adest remedium ordinarium, ibi cessat extraordinarium,</hi> as that was holden then, sauing in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine cases afore by me touched.</p>
                     <p>But this Crime here obiected against <hi>Paul,</hi> was accounted ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall by the <hi>Iewes,</hi> and he had ynow that were his <hi>Accusers,</hi> so that there needed to be none <hi>Enquirie, ex officio mero,</hi> against him.

                        <hi>Claudius Lysias</hi> the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, signifieth plainely by letter to <hi>Felix</hi> the Gouernour, that he <hi>had commanded his accusers to speake (before the Gouernour,) the things, that they had against Paul.</hi> So that the <hi>Gouernour</hi> not knowing the cause, and knowing that the <hi>Accusers</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded to prosecute before him, had iust occasion to say, that he would then heare him, when his <hi>Accusers</hi> came. And in the next Chapter, <hi>Tertullus</hi> an <note n="4" place="margin">Acts. 24. <abbr>V.</abbr> 2.</note> Orator did accordingly come with others of the Iewes, and <hi>accused</hi> him before <hi>Felix.</hi> Likewise when he was afterwarde conuented before <hi>Porcius Festus,</hi> (the Gouernour that succeeded next) <hi>the Iewes</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>But to make it plaine euen out of that place, that the <hi>Romanes</hi> besides the way of <hi>Accusation</hi> vsed also (vpon cause) to <hi>enquire of Office: Lysias</hi> the Colonell (by occasion of the crie and vprore made against <hi>Paul)</hi> did without any mans <note n="6" place="margin">Acts. 22. <abbr>V.</abbr> 24.</note> instigation, (and therefore <hi>of Office) commaund that hee should be scourged and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; that he might knowe, wherefore they cried so on him.</hi> Where (by the way) appeareth, not onely that he was then proceeded with <hi>of Office,</hi> but also it was meant that hee should be (vpon

those onely enducements) examined by torture, of matters that might be <hi>Poenall</hi> to himselfe. Neither did <hi>Paul</hi> take exception against this course as vnlawful, nor the Captaine conceiue feare, that he had done more then he could iustifie, in any other respect but this, because <hi>Paul was a Citizen of Rome.</hi> For they had a law, <note n="1" place="margin">Duodecim Tab.</note> that a Citizen might not be beaten with roddes, nor tortured any way, but by <hi>decree</hi> of the people. And yet any other of their subiects might be, and were often so vsed.</p>
                     <p>It is notorious to them that haue read any thing almost, of the state of that <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> that the <hi>Dictators</hi> (who for their halfe yeere had a <hi>Soueraigne</hi> authoritie) did <hi>enquire</hi> and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish euen <hi>capitally, ex Officio,</hi> as they in discretion thought meete.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Censors</hi> of maners had and practised for their fiue yeeres space, the <hi>Enquirie</hi> and punishment <hi>ex Officio,</hi> of sundry misde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors and dissolute courses of life; not <hi>capitally,</hi> but either by <hi>deposing</hi> men from their offices and degrees, by <hi>noting them with infamie,</hi> by <hi>corporal punishments</hi> of the lighter sort, or by <hi>fine,</hi> or by all these.</p>

                           </gap>pist. 64.</note> in respect of some difficultie, doth require to be plainly opened. <hi>Syagrius</hi> bishop of <hi>Verona</hi> had called afore him one <hi>Indicia, san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctificata benedictione,</hi> a professed Virgin (as I take it) vpon questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her incontinencie. There was none <hi>Accuser</hi> that tooke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to proue it; neither was any <hi>Fame</hi> risen thereof; but <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidia conflata ipsi,</hi> she was depraued by light persons, by hereticks, and infamous men, and that by wicked practises, through bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie and intemperancie: yea by some such as had bene (afore) put out of her house, for actions farre vnseeming that, which they outwardly professed. But it was alledged in iustification of the saide <hi>Bishops</hi> proceeding with her, that <hi>a rumour</hi> had bene spread, that the saide <hi>Indicia</hi> had borne a childe, which she had made away. And that this <hi>rumour</hi> was so spread by certaine
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:19125:154"/>
women (though but base) that ranne vnto the <hi>Monasterie,</hi> and there first bruited it, from whence it came abroade among the people, and so to the eares of one <hi>Maximus.</hi> Howbeit, these which were said to be the first authors of that <hi>rumour,</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed out of the way. Now <hi>Syagrius</hi> the <hi>Bishop</hi> there, hearing of such a <hi>rumour,</hi> and thereupon proceeding against the saide <hi>Indicia,</hi> did decree, that she should be inspected by Midwiues, for the clearing and proofe of her Virginitie. Which (as he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged) he did the rather; because certaine (taking scandal here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at) did affirme; that if she should be tolerated without such <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection,</hi> they would not communicate any more with their <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop.</hi> But <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> there taxeth them thus: <hi>Quales illi, qui vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt praescribere Sacerdotibus, quid sequi debeamus? What kinde of persons be these, that will presume to prescribe vnto vs Bishops, what we haue to doe?</hi> And albeit the said <hi>Maximus</hi> was (in very trueth) the <hi>Relatour</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Now because a woman of her qualitie, in so disorderly sort, vpon no better grounds of inducement, was adiudged to so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely a course of clearing her Virginitie; and of so great vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaintie, besides the danger, that the Midwiues might be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orned: Therefore <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> (being <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>Millaine,</hi> in whose Prouince <hi>Verona</hi> stoode) did auocate this cause from the <hi>Bishop</hi> vnto his owne <hi>audience.</hi> He therefore hearing it <hi>Iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially,</hi> in the presence of his brethren and fellowe <hi>Bishops</hi> (to whom he imparted it:) besides the former defects, did finde vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on examining of the matter, that <hi>Renatus</hi> and <hi>Leontius</hi> two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses produced vpon the <hi>Fame,</hi> which it was entended they had heard (though they were suborned) yet did they materially va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one from the other, in the ground of the cause. It fell out likewise by proofe, that they two had sent out of the way, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curius</hi> and <hi>Lea;</hi> two other supposed witnesses, and but lewde persons. Also that another pretended witnesse, called <hi>Theudule</hi> was runne away, knowing that it would be obiected in way of exception against her; how she had lien at the saide <hi>Renatus</hi> his beds feete. Besides, another woman had also confessed, that the said <hi>Renatus</hi> did commit fornication with her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="134" facs="tcp:19125:155"/>
Now because hereupon, no sinister or bad <hi>fame</hi> against <hi>Indicia</hi> was in Lawe sufficiently proued; but rather to the contrary a good <hi>fame</hi> was proued by one <hi>Paterna,</hi> and by the nurse of <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia:</hi> therefore <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> absolued and dismissed her from such <hi>inspection,</hi> restoring her to her former good name, but co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demning <hi>Maximus,</hi> and excommunicating <hi>Renatus</hi> and <hi>Leontius</hi> for their indirect, vniust, and <hi>calumnious</hi> dealings. Yet did he not (as he saith) simply co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demne that kinde of <hi>purgation</hi> and proofe of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginitie, by <hi>inspection.</hi> For he saith thus: <hi>Quid ergo? Negamus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiciendas virgines interim, quòd nusquam legerim? Non adstruo, nec verum arbitror.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In which Processe, many pointes may be noted, to auoche the Iurisdiction of <hi>Archbishops</hi> and <hi>Bishops,</hi> and sundrie their proceedings <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> at this day: but I finde no footesteps or colour of any mislike. If these wordes of his, be alledged to proue, that no <hi>Criminall</hi> Processe should be made without an <hi>Accuser</hi> properly so called: viz. <hi>It is requisite, that the witnesses be voyd of partialitie; yet so that there first appeare an Accusour;</hi> this very Epistle will shewe, that such <hi>Accusour</hi> (though then they were more vsuall) is not necessarily alwayes to be required. For he findeth fault, that she was conuented, although there would appeare, <hi>neque author criminationis, neque accusator, neque professor delationis; Maximus</hi> (in trueth) being vnder-hand both a <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latour,</hi> and a kinde of <hi>Prosecutour.</hi> So that (no <hi>Fame</hi> being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) if any one would but haue shewed himselfe as a <hi>Relatour,</hi> or a <hi>Denounceour;</hi> it might haue sufficed, though he were not a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Accusour, Qui delationis se nexu obligabat;</hi> as <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> there speaketh of the <hi>Inscription</hi> required (by Lawe) <hi>adpoenam Talionis,</hi> for him, which should faile in proofe. And in trueth, if <hi>Enquire of office</hi> were not lawfull, and none <hi>Accusour</hi> were to be receiued, but as Lawe and olde <hi>Canons</hi> appoint; assuredly there would be fewe or no Crimes at all in any Court euer prosecuted. So great is the trouble and danger.</p>
                     <p>Besides if the want of an <hi>Accusour,</hi> had bene sufficient to haue reuersed <hi>Syagrius</hi> his sentence, and to haue quashed the whole Processe: then what needed <hi>S. Ambrose</hi> so carefully to haue exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined her <hi>Fame</hi> good or bad, by so many witnesses? But that he knew (if an euill <hi>Fame</hi> had bene proued) the <hi>Iudge</hi> might by
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:19125:155"/>
Lawe haue proceeded as he did, without any either <hi>Accusour</hi> or <hi>Denunceour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that we see, he thought it meete, and by Lawe required at his handes, for her clearing and absoluing, to make <hi>Enquirie</hi> of the <hi>Fame;</hi> albeit eche of those were wanting. And therefore he did <hi>of meere Office</hi> by way of <hi>Enquirie,</hi> proceede to the final sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencing of that cause. In like sort was that his condemnation of <hi>Maximus, Renatus,</hi> and <hi>Leontius,</hi> done of his <hi>meere Office,</hi> without somuch as prosecution by any other man.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore to shewe, that hee required not of necessitie an <hi>Accusour</hi> in euery <hi>Criminall</hi> cause; he maketh there a plaine se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance betweene the <hi>Ciuill</hi> Lawes (as in that behalfe they were then most practised) from the Lawes <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> euen at that time. For (saith he) <hi>Si leges publicas interrogemus, accusatorem exigunt: Si Ecclesiae, duobus</hi> (in quit) <hi>aut tribus testibus stat omne verbum.</hi> Then where witnesses might bee had to prooue the matter, there was not in an <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> cause (no not in <hi>Saint Ambroses</hi> time) any <hi>Accusour</hi> necessarilie required, besides the <hi>Iudges Office.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the 136. Epistle of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> by him also quoted, there is nothing sounding that way. Hee there onely sheweth, that <hi>Bonifacius</hi> a Priest, was not detected before him of any Crime, and that he had not commaunded his name to be razed out of the number of Priests.</p>
                     <p>In the next Epistle is contained, that the saide <hi>Bonifacius</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>S. Augustines</hi> householde, and perceiuing the lewde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of another in that house, would neither agree vnto it, nor yet conceile it. The other being complained of by him to <hi>S. Augustine</hi> their <hi>Bishoppe,</hi> did replie; that <hi>Bonifacius,</hi> seeing hee could not (as he would) abuse his chastitie, did seeke (of spite) in that sort to touche his good name. Touching this reciprocall Crimination of one of them against the other, <hi>S. Augustine</hi> 
                        <note n="1" place="margin">August. Epist. 137.</note> saith thus: <hi>When this matter had long troubled mee</hi> (saith he) <hi>fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no meane, whereby the one of the two might be conuinced (albeit I beleeued the Priest better) I thought at first to leaue them both to God, vntill some such iust and plaine cause might appeare in th'one of them (whom in deede I greatly held suspected) whereby I might turne him out of mine house. But afterwards calling to minde, that at the
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:19125:156"/>
Sepulchers of some Martyrs, it pleased God sometimes to worke myra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously; I willed them both to goe to the place where the Martyr Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix of</hi> Nola <hi>was buried; because from thence whatsoeuer should happen from God to be reueiled vpon either of them, might most easily and faithfully be signified vnto me by writing.</hi> Can any thing hereof be gathered against <hi>Criminall</hi> Processe made <hi>of Office?</hi> Why? It mentioneth neither the one course, nor the other.</p>
                     <p>But perhaps it will be saide, that <hi>S. Augustine</hi> put neither of them to a <hi>Corporallothe.</hi> Therein he did most orderly and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Lawe. For no Lawe would permit it in this case, the Crime being not manifested abroade by any <hi>Fame</hi> &amp;c. And the Criminations being mutual, eche of them being <hi>Denounced</hi> and charged by the other to be Criminous. But for treating of such othes, this is not the peculiar place.</p>
                     <p>Another of his places quoted out of <hi>S. Augustine,</hi> I cannot coniecture why hee bringeth; except hee meant to alledge it against <hi>Accusation,</hi> because speaking to a <hi>Donatist</hi> of a <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi> 
                        <note n="1" place="margin">August. Ep. 164.</note> he saith thus: <hi>Emeritum certè non decet defendere Optatum, sed fortasse nec accusare.</hi>

                     <p>That this interpretation is not forced, and that the practice of their <hi>Consistorial Elderships</hi> is according thereunto; may be made manifest by one <note n="1" place="margin">Calu.

Nowe it happened, that sundry in <hi>Geneua</hi> had daunced toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the house of one <hi>Balthasars</hi> widowe, amongst whom one was a <hi>Syndicke</hi> (which is one of the foure chiefe magistrates ofthat Towne) and another of them was an <hi>Elder</hi> of the Church, for that yeere. This matter comming (I knowe not howe) vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Caluins</hi> eare, they were called to the <hi>Consistorie,</hi> and charged with that offence, without any <hi>Accuser</hi> or <hi>partie</hi> (and therefore of <hi>meere office)</hi> vpon none other ground, but because, <hi>Resmihi comperta fuit:</hi> saith <hi>Caluin,</hi> I knewe the matter well ynough. Neuerthelesse, all (almost) that were conuented, denied it at first very constantly. At length <hi>Caluin</hi> iudged, that they should be driuen to confesse the trueth, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>their corporal othes.</hi> This was done accordingly, &amp; the matter was thereupon confessed: the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, bcause <hi>Corneus</hi> (one of the same companie) gaue them war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that he would not suffer any of them to be forsworne. Yet for all this, one <hi>Elder Henrich,</hi> seeing he was to be deposed from his <hi>Eldership</hi> for it, he would not so easely giue ouer his hold; but alledged against their course of proceeding with him (as in the very like case <hi>Tho.

                     <p>Diuers others of that merie companie, were likewise for the same crime imprisoned.

                     <p>First I will touch (but very briefly, not taking vpon me to doe it, in sort as <hi>Diuines</hi> could) the lawfulnesse of <hi>oaths</hi> with answere to some obiections, which is the question <hi>An sit?</hi> I will stand the lesse herein, least I seeme to seeke, to drawe any of them into ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred; as if these <hi>innouating disciplinarians</hi> did directly condemne <hi>oathes</hi> before <hi>Magistrates;</hi> which most solemnly they protest, they doe not. Albeit if all their positions (hereabouts) were scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and compared together (some holden &amp; deliuered by one, and some by others of them) both shrewd and lewde conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, pricking fast forwarde to this point; would necessarily there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon follow.</p>
                     <p>Next I wil handle <hi>what an oath is:</hi> which is the question <hi>Quid sit?</hi> Then the originall <hi>Formall cause,</hi> and also <hi>finall</hi> of an <hi>oathe;</hi> which is the question <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, (that is) why it is? Afterward, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine not vnnecessarie points of doubt; which be made concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>oaths,</hi> and therefore neerely tending to the better opening of the <hi>qualities</hi> of them. And lastly how many sortes and seueral kinds of oaths there be; with some <hi>description</hi> of them: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you may the better vnderstand what they are, and how they differ one from another: which two last doe open the question <gap reason="foreign">

                     </p>
                     <p>The most generall <hi>formall</hi> cause, and also <hi>finall,</hi> of euery lawful <hi>othe,</hi> is for a confirmation of that, whereof we sweare. Now the confirmation of matters within compasse of <hi>Science;</hi> is made by discourse of reason; proceeding vpon points, known by the light of nature, to be vnfallibly true. But the seuerall <hi>accidentall</hi> facts and wordes of men, cannot by such necessarie discourse of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, be confirmed: and therefore, those things that are spoken,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19125:164"/>
concerning such matters, are (for the most parte) confirmed by the wordes of such as knowe them. Yet a mans bare word was not thought sufficient, for confirmation of that, which was to be deliuered by him.</p>
                     <p>One cause, why it is not to be thought <hi>sufficient:</hi> is the want of care (to deliuer a sincere trueth) which most men be possessed with through corruption of our nature: but rather in steed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, very vntrueths; as by wicked affections we be lead. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>humane testimonie</hi> is not alwayes sufficient: by reason of want of knowledge: for men can not know things that are to come, nor things absent, or done in distant and remote places from them. Yet because there be sundry occasions to speake hereof; and for that it is most requisite, in the common affaires of the worlde; that a certaintie (euen of these matters) may be knowen (for manifolde occasions happening) therefore it was necessary for the further credit of such as pretended to be able to speake thereof to haue recourse vnto <hi>diuine testimonie:</hi> for that in God, there is neither vntrueth, nor any thing is hidden from him. And that which is so confirmed &amp; strengthened, by so much a better &amp; greater <hi>testimonie,</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the bare sayings of man are, must needs be intended to be more sufficiently, thereby approoued vnto vs.</p>
                     <p>To this effect we find it thus determined by a <hi>Councel;</hi> 
                        <note n="1" place="margin">Concil. Tolet. 8. ca. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer concerneth any league of peace, is then more firmly grounded, when an othe doeth strengthen it. Yea and eche thing that draweth mens mindes to friendship and concord, doth continue more fast; when they are tyed by the bondes of mutuall othes. Whatsoeuer also is to bee prooued by witnesses, is more surely verefied, when an othe concurreth with that, which is affirmed. And where witnesses bee not, it is the strictnes of an oath, which onely can descry, of what credite he is, that pretendeth to be innocent and guiltlesse.</hi> Therefore he that swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by calling God to witnesse; doeth (as it were) vse <hi>Gods te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie,</hi> to concurre with his owne saying. And it is (in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde) generally by all nations presumed; that what is spoken, with such inuocation of <hi>diuine testimonie,</hi> may be (probably and for the most part) holden for trueth.</p>
                     <p>The very heathens by <hi>light of nature,</hi> coulde discerne thus much: for <note n="2" place="margin">Aristot. cap. 18. Rhet. ad Alex.</note>

                        <hi>Apostle</hi> testifieth) an Oath is made by him that is greater: it may be asked, how (in Scriptures) God is reported, to haue sworne?</p>
                     <p>The same Scripture doth answere it selfe, in this point: for it is there saide; that <hi>men</hi> when they sweare, <hi>do sweare by a greater, but</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Nowe because an <hi>Oath</hi> is for a <hi>confirmation</hi> of trueth vnto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, least he be supposed to speake vntruely, as hath bene said: how can this doubt fall in God, who is <hi>trueth it selfe?</hi> I answeare (as afore) it is <note n="4" place="margin">Hebr. 6. v. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>amongs men,</hi> that an Oath, is for such <hi>confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> But when in Scripture God is reported to haue sworne; this is not, in respect of any possibilitie, that defect of truth may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be in his <hi>diuine Maiestie,</hi> which had neede so to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, or as if it were not needefull for vs wretches, to rest in his sacred single word: but it is done, <note n="5" place="margin">Ibid. v. 17. 28.</note> 
                        <hi>more abundantly to shewe vnto the heires of promise, the setled incommutabilitie of his counsell or decree: that by two vnchangeable things, in which it is impossible God should faile, or be deceiued; we might haue strong comforte.</hi> So that thereby we are taught to our comfort, that what is so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Gods Oathe; doth proceede, from the infallible and vnremoueable determination of Almightie God.</p>
                     <p>It may be asked, in what respects God is said to be called vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to witnesse by an <hi>Oathe?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I answere with the <hi>Schoolemen,</hi> for two respects: the first is,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:19125:165"/>
because he oftentimes reuealeth and bringeth foorth the verie trueth of a matter (vntruely deliuered by any man) either by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward inspiration of some other person, or else by bringing it to the open light and view of the worlde, which (afore) was kept close and secret. The second consideration is for his punishing of all those, that sweare vntruely: and heerein hee is as in this worlde their witnesse; so either heere, or in the world to come; he is their Iudge, and a reuenger. A <hi>ciuil Lawyer,</hi> though but an heathen, could say, <hi>Quipeierat, Deum habet vltorem,</hi> God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe will take vengeance, of a periured person.</p>
                     <p>Neither can an Oathe be saide to be a tempting or a prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of God, so long as it is vsed, but vpon necessity, or good oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion.</p>
                     <p>An oath is said to be a seruice and worship yeelded vnto God himselfe, in a two-fold regarde: the first is, in that we sulfil and performe that, which we sweare: the second, in that by calling of him to witnesse, we do withall acknowledge, that he knoweth all things; and is a swift Iudge and Reuenger <hi>of all those that loue or make leasings.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that albeit an oathe, in respect of the matter concerning which it is made (for the most part) may be termed an <hi>humane</hi> and <hi>ciuill</hi> matter: yet in respect of him who is called to witnesse; it is alwayes a <hi>diuine,</hi> and a <hi>religious</hi> acte.</p>
                     <p>But insomuch as an Oath is (vpon diuerse occasions) necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily required of vs, as a peece of Gods seruice &amp; worship: it may be questioned; why some sorte of men are repelled by politike Lawes, from taking any Oath, and from bearing testimonie? I answere, that <hi>children, mad men,</hi> and such like, are not admitted to take oathes; because they haue no perfite vse of reason: and therefore do want that due and reuerend consideration, and also that <note n="1" place="margin">Hierem. 4. v. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>iudgement;</hi> which the worde of God requireth, besides <hi>trueth</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi> to be had and vsed in taking of an Oath. but <hi>periured</hi> persons, are therefore to be repelled; because by their demeanour fore-past it is made apparant, howe slender account they make of Gods holy name: for their contempt (in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe) is intended still to rest in them: <hi>Semel malus semper praesumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur malus; praesertim in eodem genere delicti.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is made doubtfull (in diuerse respects) whether euery or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19125:166"/>
any <hi>adiuration</hi> be lawfull to be vsed amongs <hi>Christians?</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution whereof, will best (I thinke) be made manifest, by the <hi>definition</hi> thereof, and by <hi>distinction.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To <hi>adiure</hi> (as <note n="1" place="margin">Thom. 2. 2. q. 90. in Axiom.</note> 
                        <hi>Aquinas</hi> doth define it, though not altogether so generally) <hi>is nothing else, but to induce or prouoke one to do or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit something, by vsing or interposing of the name of God, or of some other sacred thing.</hi> This is vsed either towards <hi>our selues,</hi> or else towards <hi>others.</hi> towards <hi>our selues,</hi> as when by a <hi>promissorie Oath</hi> or vow, we binde our selues <hi>solemnly</hi> to God, for performance of something. And this kind of <hi>adiuration</hi> may be lawful, or vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull; according to the seuerall qualities and circumstances of the matters; which wee haue so <hi>adiured</hi> or bound our selues to performe; which is not my purpose (here) at large to prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute.</p>
                     <p>The consideration of <hi>adiuring others</hi> reacheth either to such, as be no way <hi>vnder</hi> the <hi>Adiurers</hi> auctoritie, or to such as bee. Of those which bee not vnder the <hi>Adiurers</hi> authoritie; the first, is <hi>God</hi> aboue all. Now, albeit we vse in our prayers vnto his <hi>diuine Maiestie,</hi> sundrie vehement obtestations, as by his <hi>holie name</hi> and for his Gospels, and his sonne <hi>Christ Iesus</hi> his sake, and for the promisses made in him: yet is not this (properly) to be called <hi>Adiuration;</hi> as though by this earnestnesse we thought men could, or did meane, to mooue or change his will, which is immutable: but that hereby we may the better enkindle, and stirre vp our owne faith: to the ende, we may be more fit to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that, which in his eternall wisedome he hath decreed, and though fit to bestow vpon vs.</p>
                     <p>The second member is of such, as be <hi>creatures,</hi> and these are either <hi>vnreasonable:</hi> towards whome (as I take the matter) all <hi>Adiuration</hi> as it is vaine (in that they heare vs not, or vnderstand vs not) so is it also vnlawful: or else they be <hi>reasonable</hi> creatures. Of <hi>reasonable</hi> creatures not subiect to the <hi>Adiurers</hi> authoritie, some be <hi>Spirits,</hi> and some be <hi>men.</hi> To <hi>adiure Spirits</hi> being absent, whether they be <hi>good</hi> or <hi>euill Spirites,</hi> seemeth both vaine; and vnlawfull: for that wee haue neither warrant so to doe, nor yet, that they doe or can heare vs. Besides that, their actions are not subiect to our directions, but vnto Gods alone. For (as <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> there alledgeth out of Saint <note n="2" place="margin">August. li. 3. c. 4. de Trin. Tom. 3.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Adiuring</hi> of such <hi>men,</hi> as be not vnder the <hi>Adiurers</hi> power or subiection, is sought to be done, either by way of <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion</hi> or seeking to lay vpon them (thereby) such a necessitie, as a man may (by <hi>vowe)</hi> impose vpon himselfe, (which is vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, because it is an vsurpation of a power ouer another, that is not giuen him) or else; it is by way of perswasion, to mooue him, the rather by the respect of the <hi>sacredname of God.</hi> and this is thought not vnlawfull to bee vsed, in matters lawfull, and of importance.</p>
                     <p>There resteth onelie nowe to speake, of the vrging (by course of <hi>Adiuration)</hi> of such other <hi>men,</hi> as bee vnder our authoritie. This vrging is doone; either in waie of <hi>absolute compulsion,</hi> or else but <hi>causatiuely. Absolute compulsion</hi> (in this matter) I call it; when a man seeketh, as deepely and <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily,</hi> by such <hi>Adiuration,</hi> to tie a mans will and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: as hee may doe, by the like <hi>obtestation of Gods name,</hi> binde his owne will and himselfe. And this <hi>Adiuration</hi> is very vnlawfull: because euery man is lorde and guider of his owne will, &amp; of his owne voluntarie actions, but not so of anie other mans. And according to this acception is that of <note n="3" place="margin">Origen. hom. vlt. in Matth. Tom. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Origen</hi> to bee vnderstoode, where hee sayth thus: <hi>I thinke, that hee which will liue according to the Gospell, ought not to adiure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other man: for if by Christes commaundement in the Gospell, it
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:19125:167"/>
be not lawfull to sweare; it is euident, that a man may not adiure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: and therefore it appeareth, that the high Priest did vnlawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adiure Christ, by the liuing God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if it be but <hi>compelling causatiue,</hi> that is in respect of the duetie which euery inferiour (by oathe or otherwise) oweth vnto his superiour, proceeding iustly and according to Lawe: then is this <hi>Adiuration</hi> lawfull; and requireth necessarilie, the inferiours obedience therein, vpon perill of sinne and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie of the Lawe.

                        </gap> hereof, I wil note vnto you, what I finde (proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) sayde; and then leaue the exact resolution thereof, vnto graue <hi>Diuines.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Euery such <hi>oath,</hi> is simply to be kept, if it happen not into some of the three cases here touched.</p>
                     <p>The first of these cases is; when the thing, by oath promised or vowed to be done; was (in very trueth) euen at the first ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of it, simply, and in it selfe euill; howbeit perhaps not then discerned so to be, by him who tooke the oath. And in this case, the partie sinnes grieuously in swearing; but more grieuously hee should sinne, if hee kept his oath. For euery oath must be made <note n="*" place="margin">Ierem. 4. <abbr>V.</abbr> 2.</note> 
                        <hi>in iustitia,</hi> in righteousnesse. And <note n="1" place="margin">22. q. 4. per totu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> praesertim c. inter caetera. Augusti Seuero. &amp;c. qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to. de iureiuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</note> 
                        <hi>iuramentum non est vinculum iniquitatis, vel cuiuscunque criminis,</hi> sayeth <hi>Saint Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine: an oath tyeth no man to doe that which is wicked.</hi> To like effect sayth <hi>Isidorus, In</hi> 
                        <note n="2" place="margin">Ibidem c. in malis ex l sidoro in synony. lib. 2.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>The seconde case is, when that which is promised by such oath; is an hinderance and impediment to a greater good, as if a sufficient man for it, should sweare neuer to be a minister of Gods worde and Sacraments; what desire soeuer him selfe should afterward haue thereunto, or what neede soeuer the Church of God should haue of his helpe in the ministerie. In such a case, hee sinnes by his rash swearing; but not in keeping the oath, as the <hi>Schoolemen</hi> holde, albeit they thinke it better he should breake the like oath; then that he should keepe it.</p>
                     <p>The thirde case is, when as some vnlooked for accident is discouered, or falleth out afterwarde; that was not thought vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before. Nowe, if by such euent ensuing, the oath cannot be perfourmed without crime and impietie; then (without doubt) is such perfourmance of the oathe a sinne, as well as in the first case of the three. <hi>Saint Ambrose</hi> in this <note n="3" place="margin">Ambros. de of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic. lib. 3. c. 12.</note> behalfe sayth thus: <hi>It is sometime against Christian duetie to perfourme a vowe promised by oathe: so Herode offended which put Iohn Baptist to
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:19125:168"/>
death, rather then he would goe backe with his oath and promise.</hi> Yea euen where such oath might bee perfourmed without sinne; yet may there be sundry cases, wherein the partie is thought not to be bound, vnto performance. As imagine, that I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to receiue <note n="1" place="margin">L. finali. C. de non numer. pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunia.</note> money which is in telling for mee; doe in the meane time (in assured hope to receiue it) seale an obligation, and withall sweare to pay vnto him so much money at such a day. Neuerthelesse if the intended <hi>creditor</hi> shall thereupon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to deliuer me any money; or if any other accident (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out my default) doe happen, whereby I could not receiue it; in such a case, neither mine oath, nor obligation doeth binde me, to performance and paiment. Therefore these rules ensuing are gathered out of that, and sundry other like lawes, viz. <hi>iura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum non porrigitur vltra consensum.</hi>

This knight had <hi>solemnly</hi> sworne vnto his wife; that he would neuer put her away. Which he might (otherwise) lawfully haue done (by the heathenish custome of that <hi>Citie</hi> then) either for any iust cause, or for no cause at all. After this oath, the wife was taken in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterie; therefore the <hi>Emperour, dispensing</hi> with her husbands oath (because in all likelihoode, the knight in so swearing, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer dreamed of such a trecherie) the knight then without scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; did repudiate, and forsake his adulteresse wife.</p>
                     <p>For the like <note n="7" place="margin">L. vlt. ff. ad mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipialem.</note> reason did <hi>Antonius</hi> and <hi>Uerus Emperours, dispense</hi> with the oath of one (being chosen <hi>Duumvir,</hi> a chiese <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate</hi> in <hi>Municipio,</hi> not much vnlike vnto one of the <hi>Consuls</hi> in <hi>Rome)</hi> who had afore sworne; that hee would neuer after that time be present in any meetings or assemblies of the Senators, or Decurions there. Out of which place, a <note n="8" place="margin">Alberic. de Ros. in l. quotiens C. de precibus Imper. offer.</note> writer vpon the <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill</hi> lawe doeth gather; that the <hi>Emperour</hi> may dispense with a mans oath.</p>
                     <p>Here then another great, and not vnnecessarie doubt ariseth; whether any <hi>man</hi> may <hi>discharge</hi> or <hi>dispense</hi> with another mans
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:19125:169"/>
oath; and if he may, how farre, and in what cases this may bee done?</p>
                     <p>In answer whereof; we are first to vnderstand, that according to the distinction of times, into time <hi>past, present,</hi> or <hi>to come,</hi> there is also diuersitie of oaths. One kind of oath (in such regard) is ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Assertorie;</hi> which is an affirmation or deniall with oath, touching some thing that is <hi>past</hi> or <hi>present.</hi> Nowe there is no doubt, but that this oath cannot at all be discharged, released, or dispensed with; by any humane authoritie. for the matter of it being either concerning a thing <hi>past,</hi> which cannot bee altered and reuoked; or present, which is also immutable; insomuch as it is impossible for a thing both to be, &amp; not to be at once: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the oath it selfe must needs be vndischargeable, and <hi>vndi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensable:</hi> for to giue a <hi>dispensation</hi> herein, were no lesse, then (in effect) to determine; that it is lawfull to haue <hi>trueth</hi> wanting in some oaths: insomuch as other <hi>dispensation</hi> then this, the nature of things <hi>past</hi> or <hi>present,</hi> cannot admit.</p>
                     <p>The other kind of oath, is called <hi>Promissorie:</hi> whereby a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise (confirmed by an oath) is made, that some thing shall bee done or not done, hereafter. And about this kinde of oath, the doubt onely resteth.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Promissorie</hi> oath is made, either touching such matters as doe immediately and apparantly tend to the aduancing of the glory of <hi>God,</hi> or to the benefite of sundry others, whether such benefit be <hi>spirituall</hi> or <hi>corporall:</hi> or concerneth such matter, which euidently derogateth from the <hi>glory of God,</hi> or from the benefite of others; or it is of a matter tending to the onely profite and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefite of some particular man; to and for whose behoofe such promise (with oath) is made: or lastly, it consisteth and is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon such matter, as by reason of some euent happening, or at least discouered afterward; it may bee iustly thereupon doubted, whether the oath it selfe doe binde or not, bee lawfull or vnlawfull, expedient or not expedient, profitable or hurtfull to the partie (all circumstances considered) to bee kept and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued.</p>
                     <p>In the first case of these foure, no man can discharge from or <hi>dispense</hi> with such oath; except either the oath were at first but conditionally made, and the condition faileth; or else were made
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:19125:169"/>
by such one, as is vnder an husbands or fathers subiection. For in the first of these excepted cases (in very trueth) the oath bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not at all. But yet some superiours declaration of so much, is therefore necessarie; because it is most dangerous to permit vnto euery simple and priuate mans owne discretion and iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; how farre, and where he neede or neede not, to performe his <hi>promissorie oaths.</hi> And in the later of the cases excepted, <hi>an</hi> 
                        <note n="1" place="margin">Num. 30. per totuin ferè.</note> 
                        <hi>husband or father</hi> (before he hath giuen any expresse, or impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ratification) may (euen by Gods owne lawe) discharge and disanull <hi>his wiues oaths and vowes, or his daughters, being made in her youth, and in his house</hi> (that is vnder his power) of what sorte and qualitie soeuer they bee, yea though such <hi>promissorie oathes haue bene</hi> 
                        <note n="2" place="margin">Ibid. v. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>made by them, to humble the soule.</hi> and then by reason of such disallowance there of by their superiour, it is there sayd: <hi>The Lorde will forgiue her,</hi> this breach of her <hi>oath</hi> and <hi>vowe</hi> made.</p>
                     <p>Now because in any (sauing in these excepted cases) this kind of oath is simply <hi>vndispensable;</hi> therefore we doe detest the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of the <hi>bishop of Rome;</hi> who taketh vpon him often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to commute euen this kinde of oaths and vowes (as hee saieth) into better. and so by this shift of descant, hee preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to discharge men from their <hi>formall oaths,</hi> by them adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly taken and made, to the glory of God, and for the benefit of others.</p>
                     <p>The second sort of those foure kindes of <hi>promissorie oaths</hi> are such; as if a man should performe; hee should doubly sinne. which point I haue somewhat touched in the question next go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afore. yet least a man doe erre herein, by mistaking; it is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den very requisite, that he consult with wise &amp; learned <hi>Diuines;</hi> both to resolue him, whether such oath be simply vnlawfull by him to be performed; and also to aduise him, what course hee is to take in respect of his soule and conscience; for his oath so vnlawfully, and vniustly made.</p>
                     <p>In these vnlawfull oaths, wee thinke that superiours whether <hi>Ciuill</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> not onely may and ought to discharge the parties thereof, if they be scrupulous and desire it; but also may and ought, to disanull and make them voyde, though the parties themselues bee vnwilling thereunto. And so wee finde,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:19125:170"/>
that a <note n="1" place="margin">34. Edw. 3. ca. 9.</note> 
                        <hi>Parliament</hi> here in <hi>England</hi> did enact in these words, viz. <hi>That all alliances and couins of Masons and Carpenters, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, Chapters, ordinances, and oathes amongst them made, or to bee made: shall bee from hencefoorth voyde, and wholy adnul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</hi> The reason of this <hi>disanulling</hi> of all such oaths was; for that they were apparantly derogatorie, to the publike good of the <hi>Common wealth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>With these kindes of oathes, the man of <hi>Rome</hi> not onely <hi>dispenseth</hi> when they are alreadie made, which were tolerable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst them of his owne onely proper <hi>Iurisdiction;</hi> but also (in the pride of his heart, <hi>exalting himselfe aboue all that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God)</hi> hee <hi>dispenseth</hi> with men aforehand, to make such vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull oathes and vowes: and namelie of marriages, and also to remayne in them, being within the <hi>degrees Leuiticall,</hi> which by God himselfe are prohibited plainely. yet because (for ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry shame) hee seldome doeth <hi>dispense</hi> with marriages contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, or to bee contracted <hi>inter ascendentes &amp; descendentes;</hi> as the father to marrie the daughter or his niece, &amp;c. or the sonne to marrie his mother, grandmother, &amp;c. or yet <hi>in primo gradu transuersali aequali,</hi> as the brother to marrie the sister: therefore the <hi>Schoolemen</hi> and <hi>Canonists</hi> his Parasites (but especially since the great case fell out betwixt king <hi>H. 8. and Katherine of Castill,</hi> his deceased brothers widowe) haue bene contented to turne those their former olde songs; of <hi>Papa potest, quicquid Deus ipse potest,</hi> and <hi>potest tollere ius Naturae;</hi> and (instead thereof) to say <note n="2" place="margin">Couarrauias.</note> now; that in those aforesaid degrees of <hi>consanguinitie</hi> (because they are of <hi>the lawe of nature)</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> (their vnholy father) can not <hi>dispense</hi> withall.

                        <hi>Leuiticall degrees</hi> are not of the <hi>lawe of nature;</hi> and therefore to be, by the <hi>Pope</hi> dispensable. But if they be lawes <hi>Ceremonial,</hi> they are abrogated by <hi>Christ,</hi> and need no <hi>dispensation</hi> of any mans. If <hi>Iudiciall,</hi> then they binde none precisely, but the people and <hi>Common weale</hi> of the <hi>Iewes:</hi> but if they be <hi>Morall</hi> lawes (which onely remaineth, and of which sort in deed they are) then conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are they of the <hi>lawe of nature.</hi> and, that the said prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be in deed <hi>Morall lawes,</hi> and of <hi>the lawe of Nature:</hi> appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by the words of God himselfe, generally testifying of them
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:19125:170"/>
all, that for such abhominable &amp; incestuous matches as be there specified and forbidden; he did cast out the <hi>Cananites</hi> and other people of the land, before the <hi>Israelites.</hi> But they, being heathens, had none other lawe but the <hi>lawe of nature</hi> to take knowledge of, or to binde them; and therefore could not for those polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons haue bene iustly punished; if the prohibitions of them, had not bene by the <hi>lawe of Nature,</hi> which bindeth all men indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently.</p>
                     <p>In the third case, <hi>videlicet,</hi> when a <hi>Promissorie oath</hi> tendeth onely to the profite and benefite of some particular person, to whom such promise is made (as namely an oath of a <hi>Soldiour</hi> to his <hi>Generall,</hi> of a <hi>Subiect</hi> to his <hi>Prince,</hi> of a <hi>Tenant</hi> to his <hi>Lord,</hi> or of a <hi>bondman</hi> to his <hi>Master)</hi> it is generally holden; that hee to whose onely behoofe it was made, may sufficiently agayne dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge it. because it is intended, the promise is (in deed) then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed vnto the superiour, when it is disposed of according to his pleasure, and as he liketh best of.</p>
                     <p>The fourth and last aforesayd sorte of oathes <hi>Promissorie,</hi> is the speciall subiect, wherein (if in any) a <hi>dispensation</hi> may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly haue place.</p>
                     <p>To <hi>dispense,</hi> or to discharge a man from an oath taken; hath two diuers significations and acceptions. for it is taken, either for a release of the very bonde of the oath, so that the partie should no more (before God) bee tied thereunto: or else for a sound <hi>interpretation</hi> and <hi>declaration,</hi> that vpon some euent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing, or discouered vnto vs afterward, or other considerable circumstance; such oath doeth, not necessarily (before God) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a performance.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Promissorie oath</hi> is made, either for <hi>confirmation</hi> of some thing, vnto the performance whereof, wee are (otherwise also) bound by Gods lawe, or by the lawe of nature: or of such, as for accomplishing whereof, we are besides our oath, tied by <hi>positiue lawe</hi> of man: or of such, as otherwise then by oath, we (no way) stood bound to fulfill.</p>
                     <p>The last of these three is also of two sortes: for it either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth matter some way tending to the <hi>seruice of God,</hi> and <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling</hi> of our selues before him, voluntarily by vs promised; or else matter <hi>humane</hi> and <hi>ciuill</hi> onely, by our oath confirmed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="20" facs="tcp:19125:171"/>
In the first of those three last, wherein besides our oath, wee are bound by <hi>Gods lawe,</hi> or by the <hi>lawe of nature;</hi> a <hi>dispensation</hi> by way of release of the <hi>bond of the oath</hi> cannot by any humaine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie be giuen. for else, a man might (hereby) be set at libertie, not onely to breake the law <hi>of God</hi> and <hi>nature,</hi> which is eternall and immutable: but to goe against his owne oath also: which, being <hi>Praeceptum iuris Diuini,</hi> is also (in that sense) vndispensable. Except a man should absurdly imagine, as the heathen Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes did of a water, that was in <hi>Via Appia,</hi> consecrated vnto <hi>Mercurie;</hi> for they <note n="1" place="margin">Alex. ab Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and.

Likewise if a married man who voweth and sweareth neuer to companie with any woman, but his wife, during their two liues, shall (without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny negligence or default of his) bee herein wickedly deceiued by another woman, which is by him taken to be his owne wife: it may (for his satisfaction) by such <hi>dispensation</hi> bee determined &amp; declared, that hereby he hath neither offended against Gods lawe, nor his oath.</p>

                     <p>The like is true of any oath in generall, because the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, for performance thereof, is not so <note n="6" place="margin">L. non dubium. C. de legibus.</note>

                     <p>The like may be saide ofsundrie <hi>lawes of nature:</hi> wherein this kinde of <hi>dispensation by interpretation</hi> hath place; no lesse then in the former: and are needelesse, to be further here exemplified.</p>
                     <p>Touching the second member of the matters of <hi>Promissorie oathes,</hi> viz. whereby an oath is taken for a fuller confirmation of that, whereunto we are also bound by <hi>positiue lawe:</hi> it is much more assured, that according to the second acception of <hi>dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation;</hi> such oathe may be <hi>interpreted</hi> and <hi>declared</hi> not to binde; where, indeede it ought not, by the true meaning of the Lawe; howsoeuer the <hi>generalitie,</hi> or <hi>pregnancie</hi> of the wordes, may strongly (perhappes) seeme to weigh vnto the contrary.</p>
                     <p>Yea and in the first sense, a <hi>dispensation</hi> of <hi>relaxation</hi> by a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne Prince</hi> or other thereunto aucthorized may be graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for release of an oathe, made in performance of some <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue</hi> lawe. But this is onely by way of abrogating such Lawe or
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:19125:172"/>
Statute; either altogether, or as towardes that person, or for some particular action and time; and not, by way of <hi>releasing</hi> the very <hi>bond of the oathe,</hi> which is not subiect to mans po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. For when such Lawe or Statute is disanulled and gone (as locall Statutes of <hi>Colledges</hi> &amp;c. may bee euen heere in <hi>Englande)</hi> then the Oathe made vnto them, as vnto Lawes or Statutes; must needes (withall) so farre cease, and be relea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.</p>
                     <p>When the matter is such, as for performance whereof (o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then by our <hi>voluntarie oathe</hi> taken) we no way stoode bounde, whether it bee in Actions <hi>Religious</hi> or <hi>Ciuill:</hi> the bonde of our Oathe (if in verie trueth, wee did at first, <hi>in fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro poli</hi> stande tyed) may not by anie man bee <hi>released.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse a <hi>dispensation of true interpretation,</hi> hath place in this very especially, and such <hi>interpretation</hi> may bee needefull, sometimes in respect of the very <hi>matter promised by Oathe</hi> to bee perfourmed, being (indeede) no due matter for an oathe. As the oathe for single life, vowed by such, as haue not the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall gift of <hi>Continencie.</hi> Sometimes it may bee requisite, in respect of <hi>after-euents:</hi> as if I sweare and vowe to God, to keepe some certaine spare and so straite a diet; as (through weakenesse and infirmities after happening) I can not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siblie obserue, without apparent daunger of the losse of my life.</p>
                     <p>And sometimes, this kinde of <hi>dispensation</hi> may haue necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie place; whereas some thing doth after fall out, or (at least) is discouered; which I neuer forethought, or if I had, by all probabilitie, I woulde neuer haue vowed or vndertaken so much. Examples of these you may frame many, out of that, which hath beene answered to that question; whether all <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missorie oathes,</hi> were absolutely to be kept, or no?</p>
                     <p>Lastly, some doubt may be stirred; whether a <hi>Christian</hi> may capitulate or contracte, (by <hi>mutuall oathes</hi> giuen and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken) with a <hi>Pagan</hi> or heathen <hi>Prince,</hi> or other priuate person, that taketh his oathe by <hi>Idoles</hi> or by <hi>false gods:</hi> seeing in so swearing, hee sinneth greatly, in that hee giueth (thereby) that reuerence vnto them, which is onely due, to the true and euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuing God?</p>

                     <p>An Oathe, as touching the <hi>outwarde forme</hi> of taking it; is eyther <hi>verbally</hi> or <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally</hi> taken. <hi>Uerball,</hi> when by wordes or speeche onelie, wee conceiue the forme of the Oathe; as, <hi>God is my witnesse; The Lorde liueth, &amp;c.

                     <p>Againe, some oathe is <hi>solenne iuramentum;</hi> and others be not. that <hi>oath</hi> is called <note n="4" place="margin">L. 3. &amp; 5. l. in fine &amp; 34. §. qui iusiurandum. ff. de iurciurando.</note> 
                        <hi>solenne,</hi> which hath certain sole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nities prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed and endited, either by the <hi>parties</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, by the Iudge, or

by the <hi>Lawe,</hi> with certaine set-conceiued wordes, from which he that sweareth, may not vary. but if hee doe, his Oath shall not be accepted.</p>
                     <p>All these may be giuen and taken, in two seuerall sortes. Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther simply; as thus: <hi>I speake it before God &amp;c.</hi> or with some <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation</hi> to our selues, or others, whome wee holde very deare vnto vs, adioyned thereunto; as thus: <hi>So and so</hi>

                        <hi>do God vnto me and more.</hi> for thereby wee doe expresly as it were deuote, and binde our selues or them, vnto the punishment of God; if that be not true, which wee sweare. Of this kinde I finde examples in <hi>Scripture,</hi> that <note n="2" place="margin">1. Sam. 14. vers. 24. Neh. 5. vers. 12, 13.</note> some were so imposed by <hi>Magistrates;</hi> and <note n="3" place="margin">1. Sam. 14. vers.</note> othersome were <hi>voluntarily</hi> so taken. The examples of them both, you may see in their seuerall places according to the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions giuen by quotations in the margent. An example of an oathe taken <hi>voluntarily by imprecation,</hi> wee also finde in the <note n="4" place="margin">4. 1. Sam. 20. vers. 13. 2. Sam. 3. vers. 9. 35. 2. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mu. 19. vers. 13. Neh. 10. vers. 29. 42. Cor. 1. ver. 23</note> 
                        <hi>new Testament:</hi> for <hi>Paul</hi> saieth, <hi>I call God to witnesse vnto my soule;</hi> which is to execrate his owne soule, if he had not sworne truely. So much of the <hi>outward forme</hi> of an oath.</p>
                     <p>There are besides that, two principall <hi>diuisions</hi> of an oath: the one respecting the <hi>matter</hi> of it, according to the <hi>circumstance</hi> of <hi>time;</hi> the other, which considereth the <hi>inward forme, with other circumstances.</hi> For the first, euery <hi>oath,</hi> is either <hi>concerning a thing past or present:</hi> and this is called <hi>Assertorium iuramentum:</hi> or else touching a thing <hi>to come,</hi> and it is called <hi>Iuramentum promisso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium.</hi> For the second <hi>diuision;</hi> an oath may be made, either <hi>iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially</hi> or <hi>extraiudicially.</hi> And both these (in <hi>oathes promissorie)</hi> are either <hi>Confirmatoria actus futuri;</hi> as <hi>(in iudgement)</hi> that I will vse no vaine <hi>cauillations</hi> and <hi>delayes:</hi> or foorth of Iudgement, as an <hi>oathe of alleageance:</hi> or they are <hi>obligationis introductoria,</hi> when the very oath worketh the <hi>bond</hi> in lawe, for something (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) to be done.</p>
                     <p>But this <hi>bonde</hi> is only by the <note n="5" place="margin">Tot. tit. ex. de Iureiurando.</note> 
                        <hi>Canon,</hi> and not by the <hi>Ciuill</hi> lawes, sauing in one case that I can call to minde: which is the <note n="6" place="margin">L. vt iurisiura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>di. ff. de operis liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torum.</note> oathe of a man once a <hi>bondslaue,</hi> and now set free (called <hi>liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus)</hi> that is made vnto his <hi>patron,</hi> to performe some <hi>workes</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing vnto him. For in this case, the very <hi>oathe</hi> is <hi>obligationis introductorium:</hi> and maketh the <hi>freed man</hi> bound (by that Law) to performe it, <hi>in vim turamenti.</hi>
                     </p>

Furthermore a <hi>promissorie oath</hi> (whether taken <hi>in iudgement</hi> or out <hi>of iudgement)</hi> is either <hi>necessarie;</hi> as when it is imposed by the <hi>Magistrate</hi> vpon his <hi>subiect:</hi> or it is <hi>voluntarie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An oath <hi>assertorie</hi> (being of chiefest vse, and therefore most to be stood vpon and explaned) is also either <hi>extraiudiciall</hi> or <hi>iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall.</hi> and both these, be either <hi>necessary,</hi> or <hi>voluntarie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>iudiciall necessarie</hi> oath <hi>Assertory</hi> is sometimes giuen to the defendant when there is (formally) another <hi>partie</hi> besides in iudgement; &amp; sometimes, when there is no such <hi>partie</hi> beside; but the <hi>Iudge</hi> that proceedeth <hi>ex officio.</hi> When there is a <hi>partie,</hi> it is either <hi>iuramentum calumniae, veritatis</hi> or <hi>purgationis:</hi> but if there be no such <hi>partie</hi> beside; it is either <hi>purgatorium tantum,</hi> or <hi>partim purgatorium &amp; partim inquisitorium.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Iudiciall</hi> and <hi>voluntarie</hi> oath; is either <hi>suppletorium, aesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matortum in litem,</hi> or <hi>decisorium.</hi> Which last, is oftentimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with <hi>iudiciale iuramentum,</hi> without further addition: by reason of the more frequent vse of it, in <hi>Ciuill</hi> lawe courts in elder times; when men durst trust one anothers conscience bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then nowe (generally) they haue cause to doe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>decisory</hi> oath, is either <hi>delatum</hi> or <hi>relatum</hi> by the one of the parties, that are in sute together.</p>
                     <p>Nowe I minde briefly and plainely (without tying my selfe to any exact <hi>definitions)</hi> to describe these vnto you; with onely quotations of the <hi>Scripture</hi> (where examples of them may be found as I conceiue it) for auoyding of tediousnesse, by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar rehearsall.</p>

                        <hi>Promissorie oath</hi> is, when any thing is (by oath) promised to be done, or not done.</p>
                     <p>In a <hi>Promissorie oath,</hi> there is a double bond before God: the one is, that it is <hi>sinne,</hi> if <hi>trueth</hi> be wanting: and the other is, that he is bound to doe: hat, which he promiseth.

                     <p>The effect of a <hi>Promissorie oath is,</hi> that he is bound to make that true, which he hath sworne: but if it were not in his power to doe it; then there wanted in such oath, <hi>iudgement</hi> and <hi>discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>

                     <p>So doeth Saint <note n="3" place="margin">Aug. de ciuit. Dei. lib. 16. ca. 33</note> 
                        <hi>Augustine</hi> interprete this ceremonie: <hi>The hand</hi> (saieth he) <hi>put vnder the thigh did signifie, that the Lord (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleshe) was to descend from that person.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Ancient <hi>Christian Emperours</hi> did set downe by lawe; that this forme of oath should be <note n="3" place="margin">Iustinian. Nou.

                     </p>
                     <p>For resolution of this doubt, I cannot disallow of the <hi>Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens</hi> answere, that whether the <hi>oathe</hi> be <hi>expresly</hi> by God, or by <hi>implication,</hi> it is not materiall; so that wee doe not sweare sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply by the <hi>creature.</hi> Now there is no man so full of cauill, who wil conceiue when we sweare to the oathe of <hi>Supremacie</hi> thus: <hi>So God helpe vs, and by the contents of the booke,</hi> or, <hi>By the holy Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spels;</hi> that thereby we sweare, either by the couer, paper, inke, or forme of letters; but rather by the <hi>wisedome</hi> and <hi>spirit</hi> of God, by which it was indited: and withall, as it were renouncing all the promisses, and calling vpon vs all the curses therein made, if wee sweare not truely. Therefore (<note n="5" place="margin">Bonauentura. Angel. de Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uasio, &amp; alij.</note> say they) there is <hi>relatio ad De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um actualis</hi> in an oathe, when both in words and meaning wee sweare by him: and when wee sweare by some excellent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, not simply, but in respect as there shineth in it a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of <hi>diuine trueth,</hi> or <hi>Maiestie,</hi> then it is called <hi>relatio habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalis ad Deum,</hi> a secret implied reference to God himselfe. For as the good that is doone to a Prophet, or Disciple, in the name of a Prophet or Disciple; and the despite that is done to them, or
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19125:178"/>
vnto the poore, redoundeth vnto <hi>God</hi> his Creator, and is saide in Scripture to be doone vnto God himselfe: So when we sweare by a <hi>creature,</hi> with an especiall reference to <hi>God the Creator:</hi> it is intended (indeede) as doone by him, and in his holy name.</p>
                     <p>This their distinction seemeth well confirmed by some of the places before alledged. Where God is saide to sweare by <hi>the excellencie</hi> of <hi>Iacob;</hi> it cannot bee vnderstoode, that it was by any worldly <hi>excellencie,</hi> wherein <hi>Iacob</hi> excelled; but (indeede) was by himselfe, as those wordes to the <note n="1" place="margin">Heb. 6. ver. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>Hebrues</hi> doe testifie: <hi>because God had no greater to sweare by, hee sware by himselfe. Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs</hi> oathe to <hi>Laban,</hi> was not by any accidentall conceipt or pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his father <hi>Isaacs</hi> minde: but by the very <hi>obiect</hi> of his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious feare, that is by <hi>God</hi> himselfe.</p>
                     <p>In like sort, those oaths <hi>by the life of the soule</hi> of such as they spake vnto, and that which was by <hi>Paules retoycing;</hi> must needes be vnderstoode. For the oathe which <note n="2" place="margin">1. Sam. 20. ver. 3</note> 
                        <hi>Dauid</hi> sware vnto <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nathan, as God liueth, and as thy soule liueth;</hi> is (after) in the <note n="3" place="margin">Ibidem. vers. 42.</note> same Chapter saide to bee <hi>sworne, in the name of the Lorde.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore where <hi>Ioseph</hi> sware by the life of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> it may not be taken as if hee meant (without any reference to God) to sweare <hi>simply by acreature;</hi> but it was either by way of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoting,</hi> and as it were binding of the Princes life vnto God; a thing which (thereby) hee signified to them, that he helde most deere vnto him: or else by way of <hi>contesting,</hi> and calling to testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie the truth of <hi>diuine Iustice;</hi> for execution whereof, the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the earth are set: as some of the <hi>Schoolemen</hi> do answere it.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Owe followeth the most principall chalenge by this sort of men. and it is that, which they make against such oath, as I termed afore, an <hi>oath of purgation</hi> and of <hi>Enquirie.</hi> which is, when a <hi>Iudge</hi> hauing some one or mo of those grounds treated of, and prooued afore suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:19125:180"/>
(in equitie and lawe) to ground an <hi>Enquirie ex officio</hi> against a crime; doeth (accordingly) proceede, and vrgeth the partie conuented, to answere the matter and circumstances (whereon the <hi>Enquirie</hi> to the ende of <hi>Purgation,</hi> or els to punishment and reformation is framed) vpon his <hi>corporall oath;</hi> though the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be <hi>criminall,</hi> &amp; thereby may happen to be <hi>penall</hi> to him selfe, and perhaps vnto others also.</p>
                     <p>Nowe whether such oath may by a Magistrate lawfully be vrged, and therefore not to be refused by the partie; is the very issue of this question.</p>
                     <p>Crimes and offenses are of two sortes: they are either <hi>prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bita quia mala,</hi> that is, either <hi>mala perse,</hi> in their owne nature wicked, &amp; therfore by lawes forbidden: or such as of their owne nature are not simply euill, but therefore made euill, because (for some publike good ende) they are forbidden by <hi>positiue lawes.</hi> Whether in both these sortes of crimes, those men doe thinke, such oath to bee vnlawfull, or but in the one of them, and in whether of the two; I haue not yet heard any resolution; and therefore will bring my proofes indifferently for either.</p>
                     <p>But these two <hi>cautions</hi> you must be forewarned of. First, that it is not holden by any Law in <hi>England,</hi> nor by <hi>practise</hi> of any Court here vsed; that a man should be examined vpon his oath, touching a crime, whereby his life or any of his limmes may be endangered. The reason why the lawes thought it vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to stretch it thus farre, was for feare of <hi>periurie.</hi> because it cannot be entended of most men, but they will rather hazarde an vntrue oath; then either their life, or limmes. <hi>Skinne</hi> for <note n="1" place="margin">Iob 2. <abbr>V.</abbr> 4.</note> 
                        <hi>skinne</hi> (sayth <hi>Satan</hi> to God) <hi>and all that euer a man hath, will hee giue for his life.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to this very purpose is the same text (not vnaptly) allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the <hi>Treatisor</hi> himself. which maketh me the more to maruell at the <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> (pretending to be both so great <hi>a Diuine</hi> &amp; <hi>Statesman</hi> also) that he could not see, this to be far the sounder opinion <hi>by diuinitie;</hi> and that he knewe not the policie and custome of this Realme, to concurre also therewith; <hi>howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he auouche the contrary,</hi> as <note n="2" place="margin">Part. 2. ca. 10. pag. 93.</note> afore is by me noted.</p>
                     <p>The next <hi>caution</hi> is; that if the <hi>Iudge</hi> haue probable cause to suspect the partie to be such one, as will <note n="3" place="margin">Iul. Clar. lib. 5. § finali. q. 45.</note> forsweare himselfe, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:19125:180"/>
then tell a trueth: there he ought also to abstaine from ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring oath vnto him, especially touching <hi>a crime.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This not onely by lawe is required, but (as ancient Fathers iudge) by <hi>diuinitie</hi> also: <note n="1" place="margin">Aug. de decoll, Ioh. Bapt. ser. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>quare</hi> (sayth S. <hi>Augustine) prouocasti hominem ad iurationem; quem sciebas falsum esse iuraturum?</hi> why didst thou prouoke such one to sweare, as thou knewest would sweare falsely? And <note n="2" place="margin">Aug. ibidem.</note> againe the same learned Father: <hi>he that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoketh a man to sweare whom he knoweth will sweare falsely, is worse then a man killer: for a man slayer killeth but the body, but this man goeth about to kill the soule: yea two soules; that is, his whome he so prouoketh, and his owne soule.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>An example hereof may be of him, which knowing the very trueth, yet <hi>deferreth</hi> an oath <hi>decisory.</hi> whereas a <hi>Iudge,</hi> though he know it not, but only haue probable suspition, that the partie is like wilfully to periure; ought not to vrge an Oathe at his hands.</p>
                     <p>In the handling of this oath ministred to a partie <hi>ex officio</hi> in a cause criminall, and thereby penall to him; I propound this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to my selfe. First to diduce downe more largely that equitie (which is afore in the ninth Chapter of the second part shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to be in the <hi>Enquirie of Office)</hi> vnto this chiefe and most vsu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all act in such <hi>Enquirie;</hi> that is, of examining the partie by his <hi>corporall oath,</hi> with answere to some fewe obiections made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the equitie and reasonablenes of it, by the <hi>Treatisour.</hi> Next I meane to shew it to be so far from being <hi>contrary</hi> to the lawes of the Realme; that by them it is often vsed and practised; with answer to such reasons, as be made to proue the contrarie. Then that the lawes of the Realme, doe allowe it <hi>in Courtes Ecclesiasticall.</hi> Fourthly, that it is practised and allowed by <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> and <hi>Ciuill</hi> lawes. And that it is in vse amongst other nations, with answere likewise to obiections made to the contrary. Sixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is practised and allowed in Gods lawe. Lastly I will (God permitting me) answere their obiections, that out of the worde of God and <hi>Diuinitie</hi> I haue heard made, to the contrary. First therfore touching the equity of such oath. All <hi>enquirie</hi> of crimes is made in some of these three sortes. First where neither person nor any deede is knowen to the <hi>Iudge</hi> (in particular) to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted; And such are <hi>enquiries</hi> by <hi>grand Iuries</hi> at the common
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:19125:181"/>
lawe, and <hi>Enquiries</hi> by <hi>Churchwardens</hi> and <hi>Sidemen</hi> in <hi>visitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> at the <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> lawe. This is called <hi>Inquisitio generalis, Enquirie,</hi> or <hi>Enquest generall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly <hi>enquirie</hi> is made, when a fact is knowen to bee done, but the delinquent is not knowen. As the <hi>Inquisition</hi> by a <hi>Coroner</hi> (vpon some murder committed) at the common lawe: and as the <hi>Enquirie</hi> vpon <hi>forgerie</hi> committed in some act of an <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> court; in which kinde of <hi>Enquirie,</hi> the hidden per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is enquired after, in respect of the apparant fact.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, <hi>Enquirie</hi> is made against a particular person; where there be presumptions and detections, that some certaine crime is by him committed; but whether he haue committed it or not, it is not certainely knowen: and herein the <hi>crime</hi> being hidden is enquired of, because of the person, apparantly pressed by some probabilities thereof. The second of these is termed also <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitio generalis,</hi> but it is not so generall as the first: and the last, is most properly termed <hi>Inquisitio specialis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the first and second of these sortes of <hi>Enquiring,</hi> it wil not (I take it) be denyed by any; but that such should be assumed (by the seuerall <hi>Iudges</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> in that behalfe) as they (in their discretions) thinke most fit, and to be most likely to knowe the offendors, and the offenses with their circumstances; and that they be charged vpon their oathes, touching their vtmost knowledge, concerning such Offendors. And may it not then thereby happen and fall out; that an oath shalbe ministered to one, who himselfe is such an offendor as is enquired of? For the <hi>grand Iurie</hi> (as I take it) haue their oath giuen to <hi>enquire,</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,</hi> their owne, their fellowes, and others faultes, that they shall haue in charge. And yet to auoyde this inconuenience, I trust it will not be thought meete, that al <hi>Enquiries</hi> by oathes, should be therefore giuen ouer. Then if this be a thing equall and agreeable vnto lawe, to vrge an oath; euen where it may happen the partie that takes it, to be the offendor: why should it not stand with more equitie, to vrge it vpon such an one, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he be particularly detected by great presumptions and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities; yet may happen neuerthelesse to be most cleare from the crime, imputed to him?</p>
                     <p>Againe, if one of the <hi>grand Iurie</hi> being to be sworne would
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:19125:181"/>
denie to take the oath, except hee might haue some certaine of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenses (vsually giuen in charge) left out and foreprised seuerally out of his oath, least otherwise hee should thereby be driuen <hi>to accuse</hi> himselfe: or if one supposed, most able to giue <hi>euidence,</hi> and <hi>information</hi> to the <hi>Coroners enquest,</hi> vpon a murder commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; should desire to bee spared from telling his vtmost know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge thereof, vpon his oath; least thereby hee bee driuen to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse himselfe: would the <hi>Iudges</hi> or <hi>Officers</hi> hereupon, thinke it reasonable to spare these men and let them so goe; and not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther repute them to be (in deed) guiltie of those crimes, for which they refuse to take oath, to tell and discouer their knowledges? In like so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>t therefore, why should such men, as be probably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected of crimes nothing so penall, and who refuse to take oath to answere them, bee iudged by any man to doe it vpon good ground and conscience? and not rather, that they (as those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers) refuse it, vpon guiltines of their owne conscien ces?</p>
                     <p>As the equitie of this oathe is shewed by the former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parisons; so may it also by consideration of the crimes and the qualitie of them, whereupon it is tendered in courtes <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>None of such crimes haue any punishment appointed vnto them by the <hi>temporall</hi> lawes of the Realme: and by the <hi>ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Iurisdiction</hi> (whereby they onely rest punishable) the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie is farre milder then for those <hi>crimes,</hi> and the like, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted by the <hi>Iudiciall</hi> lawe of God, giuen to his peculiar people: yea not to be accounted (in very trueth, and for the most part) so much a <hi>punishment</hi> as a <hi>medicine,</hi> tending to the reformation of the delinquent (principally:) and secondarilie to the terrour or satisfaction of others.</p>
                     <p>Out of this number of <hi>medicinable punishments,</hi> I onely do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept incorrigible <hi>heresie, Atheisme,</hi> and <hi>Apostacie from Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie:</hi> which (for the horrour and danger of them vnto others) <hi>ense resecantur, ne pars syncera trahatur.</hi> Both these three, and the rest are in such abhomination with Almightie God, so mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foldly dangerous to the offenders soule, so noisome and preiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to the lawes, and vnto all <hi>ciuill</hi> societies of men in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth: that no well aduised man will thinke them meete
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:19125:182"/>
to be suffered to take roote and growe, but rather by all meanes possible to bee discouered, and corrected. But being workes of darknes, &amp; by the very remnants of those sparkes of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of honest and vnhonest, iust and vniust (that continue with vs since <hi>Adams</hi> fall) euen by them that commit them, they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demued to be such, as had need to be shrowded in all secrecie. And therefore they are of that qualitie and nature, as cannot (lightly by any possibilitie) be discouered, but either by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties themselues, or by other partakers with them in the verie crimes; and (thereby) parties also to the same offences. Yet (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> saieth) a malefactor for the most part leaueth some footesteps and traces behinde him, which may serue to good purpose, for his discouerie. Whereupon it commeth to passe, that presumptions fall out to be knowen abroad, of great likelihood and probabilitie; that such crimes and offences haue bene com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted and done by such a person. So that when <hi>great bruites and fames</hi> hereof doe flie abroad to the offence of the godly, to a <hi>scandall</hi> and a stumbling blocke vnto the weake <hi>Christian,</hi> and to the obloquie of our holy faith and profession, with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon aduersarie: wee must either permit such a supposed delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and thus discouered, to bee <hi>examined</hi> by his <hi>oath</hi> touching the crime, and materiall circumstances of it: or else must wee suffer sinnes and grieuous enormities (so they bee closelie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted) to growe vp and take strength without controlment; till they haue gathered that head, that they shall bee able euen with their peize and grieuousnesse, to ruinate both <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common wealth.</hi> which if it bee vnreasonable and vngodly (all things afore weied) then that whereupon it followeth must needs be absurd also.</p>
                     <p>If in hainous and daungerous crimes to the person of the <hi>Prince</hi> or <hi>state</hi> of the kingdome (whereof there be good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities and presumptions agaynst some person) it bee hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den necessarie and lawfull <hi>Policie;</hi> to torture the supposed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents, that they may confesse, albeit it bee capitall to themselues and to others also in the highest degree: is it not of as great equitie in crimes of no lesse secrecie, and some of them in no lesse execration with <hi>Almightie God</hi> then these, to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19125:182"/>
vse the meanes of the parties oath; where no <hi>capitall,</hi> nor (often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) no <hi>corporall,</hi> yea (for the most part) where no punishment at all (properly) so to be called, but a <hi>correcting</hi> and <hi>reforming</hi> of the partie, is intended?</p>
                     <p>When there be great presumptions of complots laied, that are dangerous to the <hi>Prince</hi> and whole <hi>state:</hi> is it holden good <hi>policie,</hi> to let the parties alone (without either <hi>torture</hi> or <hi>exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation)</hi> vntill some will voluntarilie offer himselfe to be an <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuser,</hi> and to bee able to make proofe of them, though the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie bee neuer once <hi>examined?</hi> I feare mee greatlie, if this were holden for lawe and equitie; such great and secrete offences would neuer come to <hi>Iustice,</hi> till there were no man to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister it, but the offenders themselues. And may not then the like be conceiued iustlie of crimes subiect to <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and <hi>Iurisdiction?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the diuision of the seuerall kindes of <hi>oathes,</hi> there are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned certaine, (euen where two parties bee <hi>formally</hi> in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) that be <hi>necessarie</hi> to bee taken by the other partie, when as the suite is but betwixt two priuate persons, and touching their owne priuate commoditie and interest.

                     <p>When an enemie of malice or for other sinister respect doeth <hi>accuse</hi> a man of a crime, <hi>iudiciallie;</hi> and brings him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon into question and great danger; if he cannot make suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proofes for his condemnation, yet by probable presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hath so touched him, as thereby hee becommeth vnto the <hi>Iudge</hi> iustly to bee holden suspected thereof: In this case, (by both the lawes aforesaid) the Iudge is to giue an oath of <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to the suspected person, touching that crime; which if he shall refuse, he is holden as conuicted of it: whereby it may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that his accuser is more gratified and pleasured, then by any
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19125:183"/>
proofes that him selfe could bring, or could otherwise procure. Is there not then much more equitie, when the question and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie</hi> of the crime is stirred vp for a better purpose; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any such malitious accuser; that vpon like presumptions and probabilities, the like oath should be giuen and tendered by the <hi>Iudge,</hi> to such supposed delinquent?</p>
                     <p>Can any man giue a sound reason, why it should seeme equall, that when an enemie gaue the first occasion, <hi>pars reae</hi> should then (vpon presumptions) be vrged to take the oath, or els to be condemned of the crime; And that it should not bee much more equitie for him to take it; when the <hi>Iudge</hi> (for his dueties sake, and stirred vp by probable inducements) doeth originally call him into question?</p>
                     <p>And when a man is pressed with such probabilities as the Iudge findeth to be sufficient thereunto, hee is iustly put to his oath of clearing himselfe, if hee so can; and so this tendeth (in some sort) to his owne benefit. Is it not much more reason then, that vpon the like presumptions appearing to the <hi>Iudge,</hi> hee be vrged to that oath, to tell the whole trueth of the matter, with the pertinent circumstances, aswell for the publike benefites sake of the <hi>common weale,</hi> as for his owne good, and escaping of punishment?</p>
                     <p>Some may perhaps here aske, why the proceeding by the Iudge of <hi>Office</hi> should bee more priuiledged in this behalfe, then when a crime is proceeded against, by an <hi>accuser or party?</hi> For in the very beginning of the sute, the Iudge proceeding <hi>ex officio</hi> may require the oath of the supposed delinquent tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching both circumstances and crime: but when hee proceedeth by way of <hi>accusation,</hi> albeit in courts <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> the partie conuented may be examined by oath vpon other matter of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, yet hee may not so be examined touching the very fact and crime, or any thing neerely or <hi>presumptiuely</hi> tending thereunto; vntill by sufficient <hi>presumptions,</hi> the <hi>Iudge</hi> be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, to account him greatly to be holden suspected.</p>
                     <p>This question (almost) doeth answere it selfe: for when the <hi>Iudge</hi> proceedeth by <hi>enquirie;</hi> before hee offer the oath to the partie, the presumptions against the partie are knowen vnto the <hi>Iudge:</hi> but when by way of <hi>accusation,</hi> till the <hi>accuser</hi> haue
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:19125:184"/>
brought in such proofes as hee can, they are not knowen vnto him. Besides, the <hi>Accuser</hi> doeth it of malice, or for reuenge, or for other satisfaction of his owne priuate humour, for the most part: But the Iudge (by common entendement) doeth it of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie of minde, and for the good of the <hi>common weale.</hi>

                     <p>But the <hi>Treatisour,</hi> towards the very beginning of his dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation against these oaths, surmiseth; that in iustification of the equitie and conueniencie of them, it will by vs <hi>be alledged,</hi> that <hi>the same is requisite for the Enquirie, and finding out of suspected faultes, whereof there is no proofe: and to search and trie the euill mindes and corrupt consciences of dangerous dissemblers, and so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie for the gouernement of the Church and common wealth.</hi> He that may penne his owne Commission, will commonly make it large enough: and he that may be allowed to frame and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per his aduersaries armour, is likely to make it thinne and slen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der inough. Were it then any maruell, though this man should throughly answer such obiections, as be wholy of his owne fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming? You are to vnderstand, that by this worde <hi>the same,</hi> in this place vsed; he vnderstandeth <hi>generall oathes for a man to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer all his thoughtes, wordes and deedes:</hi> whereof he had spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the sentence afore: and this is the false issue which <hi>(in the Epistle to the Reader)</hi> I haue noted to bee by him tendered: agaynst which, if any reason <hi>materiall</hi> had bene brought by him: yet it were but <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>, that is, fighting with his owne shadowe, and nothing touching any lawe or practise in this Realme.</p>
                     <p>In way of retortion against vs vpon this obiection, he infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, <hi>that all such are iustly reprooued, who haue practised and put in
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:19125:184"/>
vre this generall oath, where otherwise there was sufficient proofe.</hi> But he may not thus cary away this later point which he inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laceth, viz. that there is no lawfull vse of any defendants oath touching a matter criminall, <hi>where other sufficient proofes may be had.</hi> For these absurdities hereupon would followe: First where no witnesses are knowen to the <hi>Iudges</hi> aforehand (though they come in after the parties oath taken) that there a man by his owne periurie should bee for euer cleared and acquited, and so (without any punishment or other worldly danger) hee might heape one grieuous sinne vpon another. Secondly that a mans owne single oathe in his owne cause, yea and for his owne clearing should bee as effectuall and powerfull, as any two <note n="*" place="margin">Vide de hoc plura. ca. vit. 3. partis.</note> mens oathes (by Gods worde) are allowed to be, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching another mans fact, whether it tende to acquitall, or to condemnation. Thirdly it would thereof follow, that all oathes in causes <hi>criminall</hi> should be of <hi>purgation)</hi> and <hi>clearing onely,</hi> and none at all of <hi>Enquirie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Treatisour</hi> himselfe reasoneth also in this his booke against <hi>all cathes for purgation:</hi> So that vpon the whole mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, hee maketh all kindes of oathes by defendants touching their owne offenses or misdemeanors to be simply vniust and vnlawfull: The contrary whereof in both will (I trust) be proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. Lastly it would hereupon follow, that not onely <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall Courts,</hi> but (for auoyding like iniustice,) the Starre-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber also should be barred, from giuing an oath in any criminall cause to the defendant, where the matter may (perhaps) bee prooued by witnesses.</p>
                     <p>But (I pray) howe can either the Court, or the prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour tell precisely, what the witnesses will or can prooue, when they come to depose, by vertue of their oathes? For many a man when he is sworne telleth another tale, then he did afore, when his tongue walked at libertie.</p>
                     <p>Therefore (by this opinion) the Iudges for giuing the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant such an oath, shall so long remaine vnder a doubtfull dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to haue dealt vniustly; vntill (by the euent of the sute) it might be discouered; that the matter (indeede) coulde not bee proued by witnesses.</p>

The <hi>Treatisor,</hi> in refuting <hi>ex absurdo</hi> his own absurd obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; bringeth in (by the way) that these general oathes <hi>would enforce men to accuse themselues to their publike shame, reproch, or condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: and their naturall parents, deerest friends, and neerest neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours:</hi> or else for auoyding of such <hi>mischiefe and inconuenience, to commit most wilfull and damnable periurie:</hi> and the <hi>Notegathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer</hi> sayth it is vnnaturall: which because it will be (perhappes) applied also to all oathes giuen euen in a particular criminall cause, and for that he thinketh this a matter very absurde; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it requireth some briefe answere.</p>
                     <p>When a man vpon some such sufficient inducement, as is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the second part, is brought before a <hi>Magistrate (by spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Enquirie)</hi> vnto <hi>examination:</hi> his discouery against himselfe or other, neither by <hi>Gods</hi> Lawe, nor yet by mans Lawe is taken for an <hi>accusation vnnaturall;</hi> but a necessary confession of trueth, whereby God is glorified, sin punished, &amp; the common wealth benefited, howsoeuer the partie susteine thereby some touch in his reputation. <hi>Be not</hi> 
                        <note n="1" place="margin">Eccles. ca. 4. vers. 24. 25.</note> 
                        <hi>ashamed</hi> (saith <hi>Ecclesiasticus) to tell trueth for the good of thy soule: for there is ashame that bringeth sinne: and there is ashame that turneth a man to honour and grace:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he <note n="2" place="margin">Ibidem vers. 30. 31.</note> saieth afterward: <hi>Doe not gainesay the trueth in anie the least point: but be ashamed of an vntrueth, though it proceede from thine owne ignorance. Be not ashamed to confesse thy sinne: and stop not the course of the floude.</hi> And therefore (in such respect) hee ought not to refuse to take and performe his <hi>oathe;</hi> as more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (God willing) remaineth to be shewed hereafter.</p>
                     <p>Another obiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he also maketh falling not vnaptly into this place, <hi>viz. that where losse of life, libertie, member of the bodie, or good name may ensue, there the presumption of periurie is great: and where it is so great, the sentence of the Magistrate trusting to such an oathe, is grounded but vpon aweake and feeble foundation.</hi> So that in this his presumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of periurie, he matcheth (without any good reason) the danger <hi>of losse of good name,</hi> with danger <hi>of life, libertie, and limme.</hi> with better reason he might haue put in <hi>losse of worldly goodes:</hi> and then by necessary consequence hee had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away the vse of al oaths in euery subiect matter whatsoeuer. For who knoweth not, that for attaining riches and substance; most worldly men, not onely doe willingly hazard their good

names, honesties and reputation: but that many doe also appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly aduenture (for them) their liberties, limmes, liues, and soules? Therefore, if for feare of <hi>periurie,</hi> none oaths may be ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, whereby a mans <hi>good name,</hi> may be questioned or impea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, much more then ought they not to be; where a mans welth and substance (which most men doe most thirst after) may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way thereby impaired, it is vpbraided as an affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with all men: <hi>O ciues, ciues, quaerenda pecunia primùm, Virius post nummos.</hi> Vertue, honestie, and good reputation, are esteemed by many degrees, woorthie to come behind riches. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I answere, that where a crime is (in some sorte) detected vnto the <hi>Magistrate</hi> alreadie: the presumption is more strong, that most men being sworne, will rather deliuer a trueth, yea though it touch themselues, or their friends (somewhat) in repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; then that by periuring themselues, they wil throwe both their owne bodies and soules into hell: <hi>Nemo praesumitur imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor salutis aeternae,</hi> saieth the lawe. In deed where the <hi>Iudge</hi> hath good and probable inducements against some speciall person, that he is like (in any cause whatsoeuer) to forsweare himselfe: there (as was said afore) he ought to forbeare, to tender an oath. But it may not therefore bee made generall, as if no man at all should be vrged to take an oath, for feare of being periured. Yet the <hi>Treatisour</hi> here doeth seeme to encline this way: <hi>in making an oath to bee ouer feeble a foundation, to ground a sentence vpon.</hi> Why? if the partie confesse against himselfe that which is obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; shall he be thought but to dallie, and to haue a longing to be punished, so as the <hi>Iudge</hi> may not safely take him at his word, and giue sentence against him? If a prisoner arrained pleade guiltie: what needes either <hi>euidence,</hi> or <hi>Iurie</hi> to be vsed; <hi>Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sio est liquidissima probatio, &amp; plusquam probatio.</hi> But if he denie it; yet if the proceeding in a court <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> be to his <hi>purgation alone;</hi> he is not to be acquited without a competent number of <hi>Compurgators:</hi> neither yet is he for euer so to be cleared, by the <hi>Iudges</hi> sentence; but that euen after such <hi>purgation;</hi> good proofes touching the very fact it selfe (if any can be made) are to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. which case happening, he is punishable both for the fact it selfe, and for his <hi>perturie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But when the proceeding is by way of <hi>enquirie,</hi> for <hi>punishment</hi>
                        <pb n="50" facs="tcp:19125:186"/>
or for <hi>reformation:</hi> then albeit the defendant deny it, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse witnesses or other proofes (if any may be had, either then or afterward) are to be vsed against him. And therefore in such case as lawe alloweth sentence to bee giuen vpon the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants oath; yea or vpon <hi>iudiciall confession</hi> without oath; it is <hi>no feeble,</hi> but rather a most strong foundation for the <hi>Iudge</hi> to build vpon.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> no lesse missing the cushion and matter in issue, then the <hi>Treatisour;</hi> reasoneth thus against oaths (which they call <hi>generall, vnto all thoughts, wordes and deeds:) Her high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse</hi> (saieth he) <hi>hath oftentimes caused to bee openly notified in the Starre-chamber, that her gracious meaning is not, to search into mens consciences; or to force the same; but onely to extend the lawes vpon crimes committed either in word or deed.</hi> Belike if a man keepe not his conscience (as he calleth it) to himselfe, but vseth some <hi>ouertword or deede,</hi> hee will then (I hope) permit the partie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant to bee interrogated by <hi>oath,</hi> (as in the <hi>Starre-chamber)</hi> touching such <hi>a crime.</hi> which if he will grant, let him, as much as he thinketh to bee for his ease; exclaime still, against all such <hi>Ordinaries</hi> and <hi>Commissioners Ecclesiasticall,</hi> as shall happen to giue such oath more <hi>generally,</hi> or without any ground prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of inducement thereunto, by lawe allowed. for these vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true imputations, will not touch any person or practise, that I haue heard of to bee vsed, since her <hi>Maiesties</hi> happy raigne.

                     <p>In this court, though the procedings (for the most part) be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Ciuiliter &amp; no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> criminaliter;</hi> that is, not to any <hi>publike</hi> punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but for the <hi>priuate</hi> interest of the partie: Neuerthelesse, many bils of complaintes bee there put vp against defendants, wherein sundry their lewd practises and misdemeanors <hi>criminall</hi> bee deduced and set foorth; and yet must the defendant make perfite and particular answer thereto, vpon his oath.</p>
                     <p>The same course is obserued in other courtes of the nature of <hi>Chancerie,</hi> as in the <hi>Court of Requests.</hi> And somtimes further also, euen <hi>quando agitur criminaliter adpoenam partis:</hi> as is oftentimes obserued in the Court of the <hi>Counsell in the Marches and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palitie of Wales,</hi> and before her <hi>Maiesties Counsell,</hi> established in the <hi>North parts.</hi> So that, to the intent of a defendants being vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by oath (sometimes) to discouer himselfe in a matter <hi>crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall;</hi> it commeth to as much in these courtes, as is chalenged for vnlawful, in Courtes ecclesiasticall.

                     <p>There be sundry considerations touching the court of <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie,</hi> which if we do attentiuely confider, will argue vnto vs, the long vse and approbation of vrging defendants answeres to bee made vpon their <hi>corporall oaths:</hi> yea though some matter of their owne crimes and dishonestie, be therein deduced.</p>
                     <p>It must needes be, that the <hi>Chancerie</hi> is the ancientest court of this Realme: because fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence all <hi>originall writs</hi> &amp; <hi>Commissions</hi> do come; wherupon the other courts do ground all their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings.

For that Court being here in time and nature the first, could not take light from other <hi>Courtes</hi> of the <hi>Common lawe,</hi> but from some other, that was both afore it and them.

                     <p>Fourthly, that the <hi>Chancerie</hi> tooke this course &amp; many points besides from the <hi>Ciuill</hi> law; is apparant, by the whole course of other proceedings there, viz. by the defenda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts answer to the bil vpon his oath, and sometimes to <hi>interrogatories:</hi> by the sundrie issues that there may be tendred: by that terme, and whole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>publication of witnesses</hi> depositions: by examining witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses vpon Interrogatories: by examining witnesses <hi>in perpetuam rei memoriam:</hi> by the terme and vse of <hi>finall decree,</hi> and manie other such like points, much varying from the manner of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lawe, and iumping, almost wholy, with the <hi>Ciuill.</hi> And to conclude, this consideration is thereby made more probable: for that in elder times, the <hi>Chancellors</hi> to the Kings (for the most part) were <hi>Clergie</hi> men, whose studie and profession then, was the <hi>Ciuill</hi> lawes. Therefore this vrging to put in answere vpon corporall oathes taken (albeit the matter in some degree, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to bee <hi>criminall)</hi> being a speciall practise in that chiefest <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Equitie;</hi> can hardly be construed to bee against equitie. and being in the originall <hi>temporall Court</hi> of the land, cannot bee contrary to the <hi>fundamentall</hi> lawes of the same. and that Court being of so great antiquitie and continuance; this answere by oath, can not be an abuse or corruption lately crept in; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the <hi>Treatisour</hi> (without any ground) chargeth all those <hi>temporall</hi> Courts that haue receiued it.</p>
                     <p>In the Court of <hi>Starre-chamber,</hi> the proceedings are against crimes <hi>criminally</hi> mooued by way of <hi>Enquirie;</hi> though (for the most parte) at the promotion or solicitation of some priuate par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie grieued. namely against <hi>forgeries, periuries, subornations, ryots, rowts,</hi> and other sundrie heinous misdemeanours: against which there lieth no <hi>capital</hi> punishment, nor losse of limme, by the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> law. Yet is the defendant there, to answer vpon his <hi>corporall oathe,</hi> not onely to the bill preferred against him; but to as many
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:19125:188"/>
other (perhappes sometimes euen crosse) <hi>Interrogatories,</hi> as the Counsell of the plaintife shall deuise.</p>
                     <p>But to this (I heare) it is replied by some, that there bee two maine differences betwixt the course there, and the proceedings in a Court <hi>Ecclesiasticall.</hi> The first, <hi>that none there is bound to take his oathe, but onely where there is an accusation preferred against him by an other: so as if he purge himselfe lawfully, hee is to recouer dammages.</hi> Touching <hi>recouery of dammages</hi> (if by <hi>dammages</hi> be meant costs and charges) these for the most part be (in this case) also giuen euen by the high <hi>Commission,</hi> that is so much impug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For (except it be immediately for the <hi>Queene)</hi> there is a partie bound to prosecute and pay charges, if the defendant bee molested without cause. But if such dammages (as they terme them) bee recouerable in the <hi>Starrechamber;</hi> I thinke they are not very great: and where the matter is preferred once by her <hi>Maiesties learned Counsel;</hi> I am tolde there be no costs adiudged, though the defendant happen to be cleared. But if (in this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe) there were any difference; yet it makes no difference in the very point in handling: <hi>videlicet,</hi> that an oathe is there giuen to the partie in a cause <hi>criminall</hi> and <hi>penall</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
                     <p>The other part of the replic (builded vpon <hi>an accusation there preferred)</hi> is indeede different from the course of <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> proceeding: but yet if there be equitie for it in the <hi>Starre-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> it doeth much more fortifie the giuing of such an Oathe in Courts <hi>Ecclesiasticall.</hi> For in these Courts, if there be an <hi>accuser</hi> or any partie that informeth or promoteth; then the defendant is neuer <hi>examined by oathe</hi> vpon the very crime. For when a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie prosecuteth, who (as the law intendeth) doth it for malice, reuenge, or some other particular respect; hee is not so much fauoured nor priuiledged in the proceeding; as when the Iudge <hi>ex officio Nobili,</hi> euen for his duties sake, and for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like commoditie of the common weale, doeth make the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>If then it bee both equall and lawfull in the <hi>Starre-chamber,</hi> at the prosecution euen of a <hi>priuate</hi> person (who may be inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the most part, not to doe it of conscience onely &amp; zeale of Iustice, to haue vice punished) to <hi>examine</hi> the defendant vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:19125:188"/>
his <hi>oathe,</hi> for discouerie, ofte times, of faults and misdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours euen openly doone and committed, and so the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie to be prooued by witnesses, and where the punishments are vsually <hi>corporall</hi> and otherwise farre more grieuous, then bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted in any Court <hi>Ecclesiasticall:</hi> then howe can it in an <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall</hi> court be thought vnreasonable; whereas the <hi>office,</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and charge laide vpon the Iudge, are (by common entend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) the onely exciters and causes of prosecution: and where (if it be an <hi>Ordinarie</hi> Court) <hi>canonicall</hi> penance (for the <hi>refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</hi> of the partie) is inflicted: And (if it be before the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners Ecclesiasticall)</hi> neither their greatest <hi>corporall</hi> paine is so grieuous, nor their fines so deepe? And yet many of the crimes are as heinous towards God, &amp; as secretly and closely commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and plotted; as any crimes are, that bee punishable before their <hi>Lordships,</hi> in that most honourable and sincere court of the <hi>Starre-chamber.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second difference by some taken (in this behalf) betwene these proceedings; I heare, is this: that <hi>in the Starre-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a man is not driuen to answere directly to the fact it selfe, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the circumstances of the facte, as was in Trussers case, as is saide.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I am certainely informed (by those that haue better cause to knowe the practise of that Court, then the Authour of these obiections and differences) that the practise of that Court is cleane otherwise.</p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Trussers</hi> case, it was the <hi>felonie</hi> onely (a matter <hi>capitall</hi> to him) that was ordered not to be enquired of him by Oathe. but touching the lewd <hi>confederacie</hi> it selfe, and of his other pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctises about it, he was ordered (by oath) to answere them. So that the reason of the like equitie in both courts (these notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing) remaineth still vnshaken.</p>
                     <p>To this reason (as is noted else where) the <hi>Treatisour</hi> also (for his parte) doeth thus answere, viz. that <hi>the Starre-chamber requireth answere to matter in facte, doone eyther to the iniurie of a priuate person, or hurte to the publike State:</hi> as if he would insinuate, that Courtes <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> vrged Oathes in farre more vnreasonable cases. Truely, if the iniurie reach onely to a <hi>priuate</hi> person, without any further offence or scandall:
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:19125:189"/>
the imposing of anie such oathe by <hi>Ciuill</hi> or <hi>Canon</hi> lawe, will not be iustified: and other then for answering matters in fact, do one to the breach of lawes, or to the offense of Almightie God, and consequently to the <hi>hurt of the publike State;</hi> none oathe is at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time there exacted.</p>
                     <p>Yea not onely in the Courts aboue named, but in al the other Courts of <hi>Record</hi> at <hi>Westminster;</hi> I am credibly informed, that, (time out of minde) it hath beene obserued, for the <hi>Iudges by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall oathe</hi> to <hi>examine</hi> any person; whome they had cause (in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion) to suspect to haue dealt lewdly, about any writ, returne, entrie of rule, pleading, or such like matter (not being <hi>capitall)</hi> touching their seuerall Courts. as namely <hi>Sherifes,</hi> &amp; their vnder <hi>Officers</hi> &amp; <hi>Ministers, Protonotaries, Philizars, Chirographers, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of Records or Rules, Clerkes,</hi> and sometimes <hi>Councellours</hi> and <hi>Atturneis,</hi> or the very <hi>parties,</hi> hauing suites.</p>
                     <p>But because the <hi>Commission</hi> (as the <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> collecteth) <hi>bindeth them precisely to crimes punishable by the Ecclesiasticall law, and to proceede according to the Ecclesiasticall lawes of the Realme, and not according to the temporall: therefore</hi> (saith he) <hi>it is a friuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous allegation, to say; such a thing is vsed in the Starre-chamber, Chancerie, or the Benches: ergo</hi> the <hi>Ecclesiasticall Commission</hi> may do the like.</p>
                     <p>First, here hee calleth them <hi>Ecclesiasticall lawes of the Realme.</hi> how then are they <hi>foreine,</hi> and <hi>strange lawes,</hi> and sinewes of the <hi>Romish Cerberus,</hi> as the <hi>Treatisour</hi> raueth? Secondly, if Courtes <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> may not deale <hi>according to temporall Lawes;</hi> why doeth the <hi>Treatisour</hi> threaten them with <hi>praemunire,</hi> for that <hi>the policie of this Realme knoweth no such oaths,</hi> as he argueth? What? may they neither deale <hi>according to temporall Lawes,</hi> nor yet in a different course from them? Thirdly, the antecedent is vntrue: for by that <hi>Commission,</hi> the breach of foure <hi>Statutes</hi> be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable and punishable: and the punishment also may bee other then <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> as is prooued in the first parte. Lastly, none that stand in defence of these oathes do drawe their reason onlie from the practise of <hi>temporall</hi> Courtes in that sorte, as hee sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth; but thus: Whatsoeuer the <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> Laws do allow and require being not <hi>contrary</hi> nor <hi>repugnant</hi> to the <hi>Queenes prerogatiue royall, nor to the Lawes, Statutes and Customes of this
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:19125:189"/>
Realme,</hi> that may be lawfully practised by <hi>Iudges Ecclesiasticall.</hi> But this <hi>oath</hi> is such; by reason that sundry <hi>temporall</hi> Courts (by lawe) holde the like course, and doe not prohibit it in courts <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall:</hi> so that, not being so much as <hi>diuers</hi> courses, they can not be <hi>contrary</hi> or <hi>repugnant:</hi> therefore these oathes are lawfully practised in Courts <hi>Ecclesiasticall.</hi> or thus: That which is <hi>iustice</hi> and <hi>equitie</hi> in one court, cannot be vniust, vnequall, or cruell, in another court, that is thereunto no lesse authorized, then the first: but such be these oathes, as appeareth by the practise of the aforesayd <hi>temporall</hi> courts: therefore they are lawfull and equall also in <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> courtes. But for more particular and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler proofe of these two <hi>minor</hi> propositions, I will speake first of oathes prescribed by <hi>statutes:</hi> And in these, first of such as be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in matters, that may onely bring <hi>dammage</hi> to the takers of such oath: and then of oathes taken in matters both <hi>criminall</hi> and <hi>penall</hi> to the partie that takes them.</p>

Howe then can most of the <hi>Treatisours</hi> arguments holde; which are chiefly grounded vpon perill of <hi>periurie;</hi> which (he saith) is likely a man will fall into, rather then haue his <hi>good name</hi> and <hi>honestie</hi> brought into question, and hazarded?</p>
                     <p>I haue also credibly heard, that in the time of that Reuerend Iudge <hi>Dyer,</hi> the court of <hi>Common pleas,</hi> examined certaine by their <hi>corporall oathes,</hi> touching a very lewde plat layde by some of them: and the names of the dealers <hi>pro &amp; contra,</hi> in that cause, were (as I remember) <hi>Greuill, Pyue,</hi> and <hi>Hockam,</hi> which being so found out, was condignely also punished in some of the offendours, both by perpetuall <hi>infamie,</hi> and with other punishment.</p>

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Chapter I purpose (God willing) to answere those poynts, which by the <hi>Treatisour</hi> or <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> are brought, to perswade; that such <hi>oath</hi> (as here we handle) is either plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>impugned,</hi> or closely <hi>contraryed</hi> by the lawes <hi>temporall</hi> of this Realme.</p>
                     <p>Vnder this consideration doe fall certaine <hi>bare affirmations</hi> about this matter; their <hi>reasons</hi> for this assertion, and their <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres</hi> to such <hi>obiections,</hi> as are by them supposed may be made, in defense of this kinde of oath.</p>
                     <p>Among their <hi>bare affirmations</hi> about this matter, I recken some things, which they imagine to be sayde or practised, by
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:19125:194"/>
                        <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> Courtes or persons: and that which they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, the <hi>common lawe</hi> either holdeth or practiseth on the one side; or els on the other side forbeareth to put in vse, in this behalfe.</p>
                     <p>To the poynt of <hi>practise</hi> by persons and Courtes <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call;</hi> are referred those the <hi>Treatisours</hi> imputations; whereby he surmiseth <hi>generall oathes,</hi> for all a mans thoughts, wordes, and workes, to bee ministred by them: and that <hi>vpon the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Iudges onely iealousie and suspition, without any other lawfull inducement precedent.</hi> Likewise that it is <hi>tendered in matters tending to losse of life or of limme.</hi> All which I haue else-where shewed, to bee very vntrue, and slanderous. Hither also is to be reduced another speech of the <hi>Treatisours:</hi> for whereas the defenders of this <hi>oath</hi> doe affirme it, as it is practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed (but not in such a <hi>catholike</hi> or <hi>vniuersall</hi> maner, as he sporteth himselfe at) to be warranted by <hi>the temporall lawes:</hi> he saith; that <hi>this is a foule sclander both to our lawes, and to the Iustice of our land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The trueth or falsehoode of which his <hi>fowle</hi> saying, will appeare; vpon perusall of the next precedent, of this, and of the next <hi>Chapters</hi> following. And so will also these other his spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to like purpose, viz. where hee calleth it, <hi>an alien here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore entruded, as a trouble some ghest into the house of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth.</hi> And where he saith, that as <hi>Sir William Thorpe, by his corrupt dealing, so much as in him lay, had broken the oath which the king is bound to keepe towards his people: so the ecclesiasticall Iudges practising in their Courts and tribunall seates, the selfe same vniust and vnlawfull maner of proceedings, against the kings people; coulde not escape the seuere sentence of lawe, pronouncing them offensiue but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and violatours of the king, and iniurious dealers agaynst his Regalitie, crowne, and kingdome; and so consequently, &amp;c. in a Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But for any testimonie of this <hi>corrupt dealing</hi> of <hi>Sir William Thorpes</hi> (which here hee speaketh of) or of his <hi>breaking of the kings oath,</hi> and so <hi>seuere sentence of lawe</hi> passed in that respect against his <hi>butcherie</hi> and <hi>violation of the kings Regalitie</hi> &amp;c. though I haue sought for it, yet can I not finde; neither doth the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:19125:194"/>
                        <hi>Treatisour</hi> giue vs any direction for it. His meaning herein (though couered with slye wordes) is easie to bee discerned, through his vizard. For if the oath were made by the <hi>king</hi> onely, how could it bee broken by <hi>Thorpe,</hi> and the <hi>king</hi> bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable? for no man is simplie bound (by oath) to performe other mens integrities. and seeing hee chargeth <hi>ecclesiasticall Iudges, with the selfe same vniust and vnlawfull maner of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:</hi> though his conclusion (drawen from the likenesse be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt these cases) be onely this, <hi>videlicet,</hi> that they are thereby fallen into <hi>Praemunire:</hi> yet his very meaning, and what <hi>conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> was by him meant to haue followed thereon, by the former part of the comparison, is made apparant, <hi>videlicet,</hi> a couert, disloyall, and most lewde charge; as if some now had no lesse broken the <hi>oath</hi> which they haue taken, howbeit procured or induced thereunto, by <hi>Iudges and Courtes ecclesiasticall.</hi> But if such Ecclesiasticall Iudges haue neither indeuoured any such breach; neither yet their <hi>practise</hi> of the oathe by him here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, bee impugned by any <hi>lawe;</hi> then can it not bee auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but that the <hi>Treatisour</hi> (in very deede) had such an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duetifull and slaunderous purpose and reach, in his words afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayd.</p>
                     <p>To the second degree of their <hi>bare affirmations,</hi> such spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>Temporall</hi> Courts <hi>practise, or forbearing to practise</hi> (as these following bee) doe belong, <hi>videlicet,</hi> that <hi>such a generalloathe or such like ex officio, was neuer offered nor taken;</hi> for you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, he is not resolued throughly; whether of these two hee had best insist vpon, or take for his issue: And that, <hi>the common lawes haue euer reiected and impugned it.</hi> Likewise, that <hi>it was neuer put in vre by any Ciuill Magistrate of the land, but as it is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly crept in amongst other abuses, by the smister practises and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenses of the Romish Prelates and Clergie-men.</hi> which asseuerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it is (in that part) voyd of all likelyhood, where it is surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that the <hi>practises &amp; pretenses of Clergie-men,</hi> did first shoulder this oath into <hi>Ciuill</hi> or <hi>Temporall</hi> Courts: so is it yet, an implied kind of confession; that it is not such <hi>an Alien to the Ciuill pollicie of the Realme,</hi> nor by it wholie reiècted <hi>&amp; impugned;</hi> as in his <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise</hi> he beareth vs strangelie in hand. Besides that, such <hi>implication</hi> is flat <hi>repugnant</hi> &amp; <hi>contradictorie,</hi> to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>Note-gatherer;</hi> who writeth,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19125:195"/>
that <hi>it was neuer vsed here to make men accuse themselues:</hi> for by this <hi>accusing</hi> he meaneth giuing of oaths to defendants, touching discouerie of some their owne offences. Lastly, that where <hi>losse of life, libertie, or good name may ensue; the Common law hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne oathes.</hi> As for losse of life, it is yeelded to be true, which he here saith: but not so, for the other two. for the <hi>Starre-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> (being a <hi>Temporall</hi> or <hi>Ciuill</hi> Court) imposeth oathes, where both <hi>infamie</hi> may and doeth follow for punishment; and where <hi>libertie</hi> is restrained most often by <hi>imprisonment,</hi> and sometimes also by <hi>banishment.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Vnto the other head of their <hi>bare affirmations,</hi> which is, what the <hi>Common lawe</hi> holdeth, in this behalfe: such of their speaches as these following, doe appertaine, <hi>videlicet, to giue oath</hi> (they meane to the defendants) <hi>in causes of life and death, is contrarie to the Iustice of the lande.</hi> This, albeit, it no way impugne any practise <hi>Ecclesiasticall:</hi> yet is it flat repugnant to the <hi>Note-ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers</hi> assertion, spoken vnto in the <note n="1" place="margin">ca. 10. pag. 93.</note> second part. Agayne, that <hi>the Common lawes haue not appoynted an oath to bee vsed, but accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the right institution thereof:</hi> and that <hi>in causes capitall or cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minall, these lawes neither vrge by oath, nor force by torment, a thing most cruell and barbarous,</hi> and therefore agaynst <hi>torturing,</hi> he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leageth master <hi>Fortescue</hi> in his booke <hi>De laudibus legum Angliae.</hi> It is wholie besides my purpose either to auow or disauow here, the course of finding out trueth by <hi>torture;</hi> yet much might on both sides (probablie) bee sayd therein, both by reason, and also by graue authoritie.</p>
                     <p>That the defendants <hi>oath</hi> in causes <hi>capitall,</hi> neither is vsed nor allowed by the lawes of this <hi>Realme,</hi> I doe yeeld vnto him, as afore I haue sayd; but for <hi>torture,</hi> let me neuerthelesse put him in minde, that it may perhaps be thought of very hard, to haue it thus affirmed; that the <hi>torturing</hi> of supposed <hi>Capitall</hi> offenders, not only vsed in <hi>Campes,</hi> but also (within the <hi>Marches</hi> &amp; prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalitie of <hi>Wales)</hi> euen in time of peace, well warranted by her <hi>Maiesties instructions,</hi> and by Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> &amp; in the <hi>Tower of London</hi> for matters of <hi>treason:</hi> should all of them be accounted absolutely <hi>contrary to lawe;</hi> or (which is more) <hi>to bee courses most cruell and barbarous.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The other poynt thereof, which is of not vrging a defendant
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:19125:195"/>
by <hi>oathe</hi> in any cause <hi>criminall;</hi> is the maine point here trauersed betwixt vs; and therefore may not be caried thus away by him, <hi>per petitionem principij,</hi> without some sound reason.</p>
                     <p>All these aforesayde speaches I doe muster amongst their <hi>bare affirmations;</hi> and haue the longer stoode vpon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause themselues doe not so much as assaie or vndertake to prooue most of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, by any colourable argument or authoritie: &amp; for that the reasons, which they tacke on, vnto some of them, doe not hang together by any <hi>consequence;</hi> and for that diuers of them might bee granted, without any detriment to the cause which wee defend. for they be but <hi>voluntarie</hi> speaches, let slip at randome. this therefore commeth vnder his mistaking of the true issue. yet they be such, as seemed not vnmeete to bee men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; least (if the <hi>Author</hi> of them doe happilie holde them for sound reasons) hee should complaine to haue a piece of wrong offered vnto him, for that all his booke was not spoken vnto, and answered.</p>
                     <p>Next doe follow those their reasons to be discussed, which they take from the <hi>lawes</hi> of this Realme. and first concerning such of them, as be made out of <hi>Statutes;</hi> and afterward we will come to their booke cases. That which hee speaketh of <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na charta,</hi> albelt he handle it last, yet for the <hi>ancientie,</hi> seemeth to deserue the first ranke. he auoucheth no particular part thereof: but taking (as graunted) a contrarietie (belike in his opinion) not trauersable, to be betwixt proceeding by this <hi>oath,</hi> and the sayd <hi>Statute;</hi> he onely (in high wordes) telleth vs, of a <hi>most iust curse of Anathematizing, laied by the Bishops then, against all wilfull infringers of that Charter.</hi> If I should gesse what poynt thereof it is, which hee intendeth to bee so contrary to these oathes; I would take the <hi>nineteenth chapter</hi> thereof (if any) to bee meant: both because <hi>putting to an oathe</hi> is there mentioned; and for that I haue heard it (to like purpose) alleaged by some other. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the <hi>Treatisour</hi> hauing farre better insight (as seemeth) in lawe, then hee that so alleaged it; thought good to skippe it ouer, without all allegation; for feare it would not so wel helpe his turne. The wordes are these, <hi>videlicet, No</hi> 
                        <note n="1" place="margin">Magna charta. ca. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>Bailiffe shall from hencefoorth put any man to his open lawe, nor to an oathe, vpon his
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19125:196"/>
owne bare saying; without faythfull witnesses, brought in for the same.</hi> I must confesse, that these wordes are some thing too obscure and darke for mee to vnderstand, what is <hi>positiuely</hi> and preciselie meant by them. and so much the rather, because I know not the vsage afore that time; which (thereby) was ment to be remedied: except I should coniecture, that the <hi>bare say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (there) spoken of; is to bee referred to the man, that taketh the <hi>oath,</hi> and not to the <hi>Bailife:</hi> and then would it seeme to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablish that practise, which is vsed in <hi>waging of lawe</hi> with two or more <hi>witnesses</hi> or handes, concurring with his <hi>oath</hi> that swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.</p>
                     <p>Howsoeuer it be (in verie deed) to be vnderstood; it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie inough to gather, what can not be meant by it. First there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it cannot any way be extended to proceedings and courtes <hi>Ecclesiasticall.</hi> for whatsoeuer is in that <hi>Statute</hi> graunted, after <hi>confirmation of the Churches liberties</hi> (except it bee otherwise plainely expressed) is referred to <hi>Courtes</hi> and matters <hi>Temporall:</hi> betweene which and causes <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> (as is noted afore) there was made both in those times, and also long after; a plaine seuerance and distinction, in the groundes of their seuerall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, and <hi>iurisdictions.</hi> so that the one was called the <hi>Kings Court,</hi> and the other a <hi>Spirituall,</hi> or <hi>Court Christian.</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as nothing was in that <hi>Charter</hi> anewe <hi>graunted,</hi> but <hi>confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> onely, vnto the <hi>Church of England:</hi> so is it to be iudged on all handes, that the <hi>king</hi> would not make lawes there, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine the courses of proceeding <hi>ecclesiasticall;</hi> because it could not be without disanulling and reuoking of that which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately afore (euen by the same <hi>Acte)</hi> hee had first of all confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnto them.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, a <hi>Bailife</hi> onely, is there mentioned, which should <hi>put or not put a man to his oath;</hi> which cannot well and properlie be vnderstood of any, but of some <hi>officer temporall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, these wordes are no way appliable, to the practise of courtes <hi>ecclesiasticall:</hi> for albeit vnder the name of <hi>Bailife</hi> an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie</hi> might be vnderstood (which were very harsh, insomuch as a <hi>Bailife</hi> is but a <hi>Reeue</hi> of a <hi>Baile</hi> or Libertie) yet is it not hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by any lawe <hi>ecclesiasticall;</hi> that <hi>vpon an Ordinaries owne bare
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19125:196"/>
saying,</hi> whether he haue <hi>witnesses</hi> after to bee produced or not; a man may bee put to an <hi>oath.</hi> for there must bee some better matter of inducement, to open way to the <hi>enquirie,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>oath</hi> ensueth.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, this statute will rather hurt, then helpe forward these mens purposes, if an <hi>Ordinarie</hi> might here be vnderstood by a <hi>Baylife.</hi> because (if I conceiue the matter aright) by this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed; that so an <hi>Ordinarie</hi> be able to bring in good <hi>witnesses;</hi> he may then <hi>vpon his bare saying put a man to his open lawe, or to an oath.</hi> But hereupon would followe, that <hi>Criminall prosecution</hi> without <hi>any accuser</hi> or other partie, and so <hi>ex officio mero;</hi> yea and without any <hi>presentment</hi> too, may bee <hi>lawfully</hi> admitted: and (which is most to our present purpose in handling) that an <hi>oath</hi> (in such case) by him may bee imposed, in any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aswell <hi>Criminall</hi> as other. For heere is no distinction made of any one kinde of cause from another, and they which alledge it, doe bring it to impugne proceeding by the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants <hi>oath,</hi> against <hi>crimes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The allegation of the <hi>Treatisour</hi> out of the statute of <hi>Marlebridge</hi> or <hi>Marleborough</hi> falleth next in time to bee considered: the whole wordes <note n="1" place="margin">Marlebr. 52. H. 3. cap. 22.</note> whereof are these: <hi>none from hencefoorth may distreyne his freeholders; to answere for their free holdes, nor for any thing touching their freeholde, without the kings writ: nor shall cause his freeholders to sweare against their willes, for no man may doe that, without the kings commaundement.</hi> But the <hi>Treatisour</hi> leaueth out the first part which sheweth, howe the second that he alledgeth, is to be vnderstoode. And because (like the <hi>lapwing</hi> with her diuerting c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                        </gap>ies) hee would leade vs further and further from the matter (herein) chiefly to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected: or for that he thought wee would make some aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage hereof; he saith, that the <hi>kings commaundement</hi> importeth here thus much, viz. <hi>according to the law &amp; Iustice of this Realme;</hi> and for this quoteth a booke thus: 2. R. 3.</p>
                     <p>The booke he meaneth (as I gesse) is in <note n="2" place="margin">Mich. 2.

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19125:197"/>
not the king in his chamber; nor otherwise before him; but by his Iustices. and so is the kings will (in statute) to be taken, viz. by his Iustices and his lawe, which to say, in effect is all one &amp;c.</hi> Where you see, that the booke speaking of <hi>Iustices</hi> (viz. the <hi>men</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whome the conuiction was made) he referreth this to the <hi>Iustice of the land.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But though it be neither off nor on, to our Principall pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; neuerthelesse it seemeth, this booke is not truely applied by him vnto this statute: and that by the <hi>kings commaundement</hi> in the statute; the <hi>kings writ</hi> is to be vnderstood, (as in the first part of that <hi>statute</hi> is plainely expressed) rather then any deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination or <hi>Act</hi> of his <hi>Iustices of the Bench.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Touching the statute it selfe; the wordes doe euidently shew, that neither <hi>oath</hi> in cause <hi>criminall,</hi> nor any <hi>Court Ecclesiasticall</hi> is thereby meant. there is onely forbidden, that <hi>lords of manors</hi> shall not inforce their <hi>Freeholders</hi> that holde lande of them, whether it be by <hi>distresse</hi> or <hi>oathes,</hi> to answere in their <hi>Courtes baron,</hi> touching the estates they haue in their landes. because neither the <hi>lordes</hi> owne <hi>courts</hi> (in such a case) be <hi>competent</hi> or indifferent, for feare of vnlawfull euiction; nor the goodnesse or weakenesse of the states men holde, are meete to be fished out by their owne <hi>oathes</hi> in satisfaction of their lordes greedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to haue their lands: except the <hi>king</hi> by his <hi>writ</hi> shall so e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially <hi>command.</hi> And yet hereby wee see, the statute leaueth it at large at the <hi>kings</hi> pleasure, to warrant euen this course: and therefore this is not simply <hi>vniust,</hi> but inconuenient onely, for <hi>lords</hi> so to vrge their <hi>tenants.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He alledgeth further (against these <hi>oathes)</hi> a <hi>statute</hi> (as hee saith) made 43.

                     </p>
                     <p>But I doe finde no such <hi>statute</hi> either in that yeere, or in any other like number of Chapter, of that <hi>king:</hi> and that <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> which he voucheth, hath not so many Chapters.

                        <hi>preamble</hi> of a statute of king Henry y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 8. which preamble (for breuitie sake) he omitteth: yet hee omitteth not to gather therefrom, that which was neuer scattered, viz. <hi>so we see</hi> (saith he) <hi>that vnder cloked and couert termes (of Canonicall sanctions,</hi> viz. <hi>vsed in the statute</hi> 2. <hi>H.</hi> 4.) <hi>the clergie men vsurped (vniustly) iurisdiction ouer the people, ministring vnto them captious and snar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Interrogatories: and (as it should seeme by histories) vpon oath, contrary to the true meaning of the lawe and lawe-makers, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the right order of Iustice and all good equitie: impugning thereby the royall prerogatiue, the imperiall Crowne, the Princely scepter, lawes, and policie of this kingdome:</hi> for which cause he saith it was repealed. These be <hi>imputations</hi> of great and high mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; which he auowcheth to be by such <hi>oath</hi> impugned. which though he say <hi>we see</hi> by that <hi>preamble</hi> (though indeede hee would not let vs <hi>see</hi> it) yet when all is cast vp, his proofes are no more but thus, viz. <hi>as it should seeme;</hi> but how much hereof may (in trueth) thence be <hi>seene</hi> either plainely, or by any <hi>seeming;</hi> I would the clearest sighted of that opinion, would take the paines to peruse; that hee may withall discerne, with what vpright mindes and sinceritie, some of his chiefe complices doe write of this matter.</p>

But (say you) <hi>it see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth rather to disallowe them:</hi> is not this <hi>seeming</hi> a sound <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratiue argument,</hi> to ouerthrowe a course so long and so manifoldly vsed, and that in the courts of both sortes? but why doth it so <hi>seeme?</hi> forsooth, because <hi>the king is by that sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute authorised to direct Commissions to Ordinaries and others, to take information and accusation, by the oathes of two sufficient per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons at the least, or by verdict of twelue men.</hi> What then? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>examination</hi> of the <hi>partie</hi> vpon his owne <hi>oath</hi> (when he is found out) because it is omitted, is disallowed?

But what if that Statute had expressely disallowed that oathe, is it not nowe repealed? and is it woorthie to bee alleaged, seeing hee else-where chargeth it, to be <hi>A bloudie and cruell Statute?</hi> I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it is verie loose and badde stuffe, which hee will not take holde of; where hee may haue but as much as a shadowe or glimpse of any thing to his purpose. May it bee thought, that any man of iudgement can bee (in deede) ignorant; but that such sharpe and pregnant <hi>conclusions,</hi> as throughout his whole <hi>Treatise</hi> he inferreth; cannot (possiblie) be grounded vpon so feeble and vnconsequent <hi>premisses?</hi> yet hee sticketh not vpon these allegations aforesayd, euen as if hee tooke them for good and sound arguments; <hi>as a well-willer of Ordinaries, to disswade them from further practise of such oathe; least they bee found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, not onely impugners of the Roiall Prerogatiue, but discredited fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the breach of their owne oathes, taken to the Queenes supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Neuerthelesse, least I be mistaken by any, it is to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that he (commonlie) limiteth all his hote conclusions with some warie wordes of restraint, as these, <hi>videlicet, such oaths, and such like, &amp;c.</hi> alwayes conueying vnder them, a reference vnto <hi>generall oathes,</hi> according to his first vntrue issue. Well, this hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth his cause neuer a deale. for if none of his reasons brought, doe so much as ouerthrow those <hi>vnreasonable oathes</hi> (which are by no man defended) howe much lesse can they touche those <hi>particular oathes</hi> to matter in fact onely, that we doe reason and treate of?</p>
                     <p>The reasons which he setteth downe as taken from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of the common law, doe now follow. which are partly by propounding some <hi>examples,</hi> how <hi>oaths</hi> be there vsed: &amp; partly by auouching some cases, seeming vnto him, to inferre a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>defendants oaths,</hi> in any causes <hi>criminal.</hi> Before he come
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:19125:199"/>
to the first of these two, there bee sundry conclusions propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by him: for proofe whereof, all his <hi>reports</hi> out of the <hi>Common lawe,</hi> be laied downe. First, that <hi>he may</hi> (as he saieth) <hi>deliuer our lawes &amp; Iustice of our land from so foule a slander; as that they should bee sayde to allowe of such Catholique oathes:</hi> Next, to assure others (like as himselfe is sure) that <hi>such a generall oathe, or such like ex officio was neuer offered by any Magistrate, nor taken by any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, by authoritie of the common lawe.</hi> Thirdly, that <hi>the Common lawes haue not imposed, or appoynted an oath to bee vsed, otherwise then according to the right institution thereof, and the godly rules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> (by him) <hi>remembred:</hi> What those rules are, I haue noted in the <hi>Epistle to the Reader.</hi> Nowe if by these wordes, <hi>videlicet, (such like ex officio)</hi> he meane onely <hi>such generall oathes,</hi> as afore he had (vntruely) imputed to Ecclesiasticall courtes; then will I not trauerse any of these conclusions, whether the oath shall be ministred vpon the <hi>Iudges office</hi> onely, or at a <hi>parties instance.</hi> Yet vpon view of his proofes for them, which shall followe; I would the Reader might be pleased to consider; whether I had not iust cause to put them downe for <hi>bare affirmations</hi> vnaccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied (in trueth) with any reason. Fourthly, those booke cases are brought, to shewe; that <hi>the common lawes, yea the common wealth it selfe hath euer reiected, and impugned this maner of swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, whereof wee nowe intreate, as a thing vnlawfull, and iniurious:</hi> But this last wee may not so easilie yeeld vnto him, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying the trueth; as we yet (verily) take the matter.</p>
                     <p>The examples then which hee bringeth in proofe of those conclusions, and withall to shew how oathes bee ministred at the <hi>Common</hi> lawe, are <hi>of witnesses deposing betwixt Prince and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, or betwixt subiect and subiect: of defendants waging their lawe in personall actions, with two other swearing with them: which wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is neuer admitted, where there is witnesse (though but one) or matter of recorde, or the parties owne hand writing: of a tenant in a reall action waging his lawe of non summons, for safegarde of his lande, as hauing none other way to relieue himselfe agaynst the false returne of the Shiriffe: Of examining the garnishours, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned (when the plaintife recouereth in a Scire facias by default) vpon an action of deceipt, brought by the defendant agaynst the Shiriffe: and of a Tenant in a Praecipe of land, casting an Essoigne
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:19125:199"/>
of the Kings seruice, where the Essoigner shall sweare, that it is no fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned excuse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Out of these being graunted vnto him, I trust neither hee, nor any <hi>Logician</hi> in the world, shall be able euer to drawe any sound reason so much as agaynst those <hi>generall and Catholique oathes;</hi> with which (throughout) hee chargeth <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> Courtes, howbeit very vniustly. but much lesse agaynst those <hi>speciall oathes</hi> of <hi>defendants</hi> in some <hi>criminall</hi> cause, whereof wee here intreate. for the reason from these, must thus of necessitie be gathered: <hi>these oathes are vsed, and are lawfull, therefore the vse of oaths in any other sort, is vnlawfull.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Therefore to presse vs yet further by some <hi>examples</hi> out of that lawe, hee saieth: <hi>It hath wholy forborne to minister oathes in criminall causes. for that in wisedome it was foreseene (by reason of mans frailetie) what danger of periurie a man was likelie to fall into for safegard of his life, for preseruation of his libertie, credite, and estimation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The great presumption and danger of <hi>periurie,</hi> if a man should be sworne in a cause <hi>Capitall</hi> vnto him, I can easily yeeld vnto. and that the sentence out of <hi>Iob</hi> (to that ende) is very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite. but for auoyding some restraint of his <hi>libertie</hi> for a time, or for the onely retaining of his woonted <hi>credite</hi> and <hi>estimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> that a man which hath any feare of God at all, or but any slender sparke of godlinesse and true religion; would wilfullie (through <hi>periurie)</hi> throwe his owne body and soule into hell; neither <hi>lawe,</hi> nor yet any <hi>nation</hi> in the world, that I can reade of, did euer <hi>presume.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if great likelyhood and doubt of <hi>periurie</hi> be so effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all a <hi>motiue</hi> for all wise <hi>Magistrates</hi> to forbeare giuing of an oath: then must he also condemne oaths, in most of the sayde examples by himselfe afore alleaged and commended. for who is ignorant, but that (in most men) there is more danger of <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie</hi> by swearing about <hi>debt</hi> and <hi>detinue</hi> to saue their <hi>goods,</hi> then for their <hi>goodname,</hi> as is somewhat touched <note n="1" place="margin">Vide 3. par. c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>
                        </note> afore? Hereupon then all <hi>wagers of lawe,</hi> should bee vnlawfull, yea not onely for getting, or keeping of <hi>goods;</hi> but especially for <hi>lands,</hi> this danger of mens owne <hi>periurie</hi> is apparantly great; in that it is much more common to <hi>suborne</hi> others thereunto, for this end; then for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:19125:200"/>
preseruation either of <hi>libertie,</hi> or of <hi>good name</hi> and <hi>honestie,</hi> when these happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be likewise questioned. so that, for danger &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of <hi>periurie;</hi> the <hi>tenants oath</hi> of <hi>non summons</hi> (who is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise to lose his <hi>land)</hi> should not be admitted by his owne reason.</p>
                     <p>Againe, if this feare and doubt be so forcible and necessary a ground of forbearing to minister <hi>oath:</hi> then what wil the <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisour</hi> say vnto those <hi>wagers of law</hi> allowed of, &amp; made (as by the bookes <note n="1" place="margin">M. 8. H 6. fo. 15 H. 20. H. 6 fo. 16. H. 22. H. 6. fol. 41</note> 
                        <hi>of termes &amp; yeres</hi> doth appeare) whereas both the <hi>plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifes</hi> were vpon their intention, <hi>examined</hi> by their owne <hi>oaths;</hi> &amp; the defendants also were permitted to wage their lawe? doe not these <hi>crosse-oaths</hi> inferre <hi>periculu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> periurij,</hi> either on the one side, or the other (seeing thereupon oath may be against oath, either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or by implicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) much more then any oath doth, whether it be <hi>general</hi> or <hi>special,</hi> in <hi>criminall</hi> causes, that he or others do im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne? Furthermore in these <hi>wagers of law</hi> vpon actions of <hi>debt or detinue,</hi> or in <hi>actions reall;</hi> this danger of <hi>periurie</hi> is inforced, not only by the consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> extraordinarie care, which most me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue, of keeping, or getting goods &amp; riches by hooke or crooke; but somwhat also in regard of their owne worldly credites and honestie; if the retaining of that bee of such moment, to induce <hi>periurie,</hi> as the <hi>Treatisour</hi> imagineth. For when one of these <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants,</hi> hath (a good while) stoutly &amp; <hi>publiquely</hi> stood in deniall of the matter, for which he is sued: will he not take it to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch vnto him, to haue it discouered (by his refusal to sweare) that he hath so confidently &amp; so long auowched an vntrueth, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to defeat another man of his due and right? and therefore by all likelyhood, what to auoid losse on the one side, and shame or obloquie on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other; wil scarcely sticke, to hazard an vntrue oath.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, it is both lawful &amp; receiued by practise also, when <note n="2" place="margin">Brooke titulo Iurisdiction. nu. 105.</note> 
                        <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> for trials of matters betwixt man and man, or vpon life and death, cannot agree within the time of the abode of the <hi>Iustices of Assises</hi> in that Countie; that then they shall be caried along with the <hi>Iudges</hi> in cartes; till they shall all condescend &amp; agree; and in the meane time they are to bee kept from all meate, drinke, and candle light. and may not this course, driue such of them, as cannot satisfie and conforme their owne consciences to the rest of their fellowes; to yeeld (at length) euen vnto dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable and wilfull <hi>periurie,</hi> rather then miserably to famish, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19125:200"/>
to perish for want of foode?</p>
                     <p>We may therefore conclude, that euery presumption or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill of <hi>periurie</hi> ought not to be holden sufficient; to take away the vse of <hi>oathes</hi> (otherwise being expedient) from amongs the societies of men.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Treatisour</hi> bringeth one other example of <hi>oathes,</hi> out of the reports of the <hi>common lawe:</hi> it is the <hi>vicar</hi> of <hi>Saltash</hi> his case, 2. H. 4. <hi>by which</hi> (he saith) <hi>the vnlawfull imposing</hi> of an oath vpon him appeareth. But it is not any <hi>vnlawfulnesse</hi> (simply) <hi>of imposing an oath that there appeareth, or which</hi> was condemned by deniall of a <hi>consultation;</hi> neither was it <hi>imposed,</hi> but <hi>voluntarily</hi> taken: but it was, for that the <hi>Popes Collector</hi> (who had in <hi>England</hi> no <hi>iurisdiction)</hi> did conuent the said vicar afore him <hi>ecclesiastically</hi> (at the suite of the <hi>Deane</hi> of <hi>Windsor)</hi> for breaking his <hi>oath</hi> taken afore the sayd <hi>Collector,</hi> to performe the condition of an obligation, that he the said <hi>vicar</hi> had entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, which is a <hi>temporall</hi> cause. What then doth this make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>oathes</hi> imposed vpon <hi>defendants</hi> in some <hi>criminall</hi> causes? For I trust (though the <hi>Collector</hi> had vnlawfully <hi>imposed it)</hi> the <hi>Treatisour</hi> will not thence reason thus mightily against vs, viz. <hi>This was an imposed oath in a ciuill cause, but it was vnlawfull, therefore all imposed oathes in any criminall cause are also vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:</hi> For this reason is <hi>ex meris particularibus,</hi> &amp; hath <hi>quatuor ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minos:</hi> &amp; besides, is a <hi>fallacie of the Accident.</hi> Seeing is was not therefore vnlawfull because it was imposed; but vpon the other grounds alone. Hitherto touching <hi>examples</hi> of <hi>oathes,</hi> alledged out of the reports of the <hi>common</hi> lawe.</p>
                     <p>Now follow these reasons that are vsed, as for a more direct condemnation (by the <hi>common</hi> lawe) of oathes imposed vpon <hi>defendants,</hi> in some <hi>Criminall</hi> cases: in which behalfe, the <hi>Note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatherer</hi> saith; that <hi>nemo tenetur seipsum prodere, is the common custome of England.</hi> I will not greatly sticke with him herein, so it be truely vnderstoode. albeit this <hi>maxime</hi> being taken notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously out of the Interpreters of <hi>Ciuill</hi> and <hi>Canon</hi> lawes: I thinke he would haue much a doe to finde it (by any booke of the <hi>common lawe)</hi> to be the <hi>common custome of England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is true, that when a mans owne fault is <hi>secret,</hi> and not any way bruted and published abroad: he himselfe is not bound by
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19125:201"/>
lawe to make <hi>confession</hi> thereof, to any <hi>Magistrate</hi> or <hi>officer Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiasticall;</hi> whether he be vrged to <hi>sweare</hi> thereupon, or otherwise. for in such case, it is simply <hi>secret,</hi> and the <hi>Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate</hi> (except he shoulde minister a <hi>generall oath,</hi> like vnto the <hi>Popish</hi> charge at shrift, not warranted by any lawe) cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly in speciall or particular manner interrogate him of that, whereof he neuer heard, nor once dreamed.</p>

Assis. 1. sol. 316.</note> booke of <hi>Assises.</hi> there, certaine returned of a <hi>Iurie,</hi> being readie to be empanelled with others, were challenged: <hi>some of them, for that it was supposed they had declared the right for the one partie, and not for the other: thereby</hi> (as it were) <hi>telling their verdict a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand: And othersome were challenged to be of Counsel or fee, to the parties.</hi> Nowe it is thereupon further reported; that <hi>such of them as were (in the first respect) challenged;</hi> were <hi>sworne to giue euidience to the Iurours: and that it shall bee so in like case, where the challenge sounds not in reproofe or dishonour of them. but for those which were challenged, that they had receiued mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of the partie; this challenge was tryed by the tryours, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hauing any euidence by their owne oathes, Causa qua supra.</hi> whereby hee woulde gather, that an <hi>oathe</hi> may not bee giuen in any cause at all, where the parties owne <hi>honestie</hi> may be touched.</p>
                     <p>But he might with better reason haue gathered (out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> former part of this case) the very <hi>contradictorie</hi> hereof. because it is very
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:19125:201"/>
small <hi>honestie,</hi> for any man, (in some sort) to offer himselfe to be sworne as <hi>an indifferent Iurour:</hi> when he is (indeede) vnindiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, &amp; his iudgement so forestalled; as that he hath taken vpon him to scan the right for the one partie, before hee be sworne, or haue heard the <hi>euidence</hi> for the other. yet neuerthelesse these chalenged persons were put to <hi>giue euidence</hi> (hereof) <hi>to the Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,</hi> vpon their <hi>corporall oathes.</hi>

For this was, but in a particular point of <hi>challenge,</hi> where the persons <hi>challenged</hi> were no <hi>defendants,</hi> but came in to be <hi>Iurours,</hi> a kinde of <hi>tryours</hi> and <hi>Iudges;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whome, there was no lawfull inducement for the <hi>Iudges,</hi> to impose such <hi>oath;</hi> other then the <hi>challengers</hi> owne excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But that is not sufficient to cast ouer the clearing or proo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the point obiected; vpon him, that is <hi>challenged,</hi> and so from the challenger; who (by lawe) is to come prepared, and to make proofes of his owne intention, which hee affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth: because <hi>nemo praesumitur malus, donec contrarium probetur.</hi> and therefore the putting of the tryall of the <hi>challengers</hi> asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on here, vnto the <hi>tryours:</hi> was a fauour done vnto him, by the <hi>Iudges:</hi> more then the <hi>Ciuill</hi> lawes (vsed abroad in other nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) would haue admitted. For he that will except, must (at his owne peril) of loosing the aduantage thereof, without any helpe of the <hi>Iudges office</hi> or of the <hi>parties</hi> owne oath, be able to prooue his exceptions. And therefore, if this very case had bene in a <hi>Ciuill</hi> or in an <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> court, that is guided by those two lawes: the parties so challenged, yea, though they had bene <hi>Accusers</hi> or <hi>witnesses,</hi> and much more being returned for <hi>Iurours,</hi> who are a kinde of <hi>Recuperatores</hi> or <hi>Pedanei Iudices;</hi> should not, ne are bound to answere such exception touching their crimes, vpon their owne oathes.</p>
                     <p>For further declaration of which point, that when an answere in a criminall cause ought to be made by vertue of a mans oath,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:19125:202"/>
and when it may be refused; I referre you to the <hi>ninth Chapter</hi> of this third part. So that the <hi>Iudges</hi> did (herein) very grauely, considerately, and but according to equitie, and to the <hi>common lawe</hi> of all other <hi>ciuill</hi> nations.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Treatisours</hi> next obiection to like purpose, is out of Iudge <note n="1" place="margin">12. Reg. Eli. fol. 288. titul. Periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric. nu. 51.</note> 
                        <hi>Dyers</hi> booke, and it is in the very booke it selfe, thus worde for worde: <hi>A bill of periurie was sued in the Chancerie, as for periurie committed contra formam statuti anno 5. Reginae nunc. and it was doubted, if the defendant would pleade not guiltie, whether he should be sworne to his Plea and also to answere to Interrogatories, as is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in the Starre-chamber: And it was resolued by the opinion of Catline, Dyer, Saunders, and Whiddon; that hee should not be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined nor sworne vpon Interrogatories: except the court of Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie had absolute authoritie, and had vsed to examine periuries in that court, before the Statute: for then this is still reserued by the last Prouiso of the Statute, as it is also for the Starre-chamber: Otherwise if the court of Chancerie will examine periurie, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted there (as it may by Statute) this must be by Latin Bill, and bee pleaded in Latin, and issue must be ioyned there, to be tryed in the Kings Bench, as in like cases is wont.</hi> In this whole report, as there is nothing that tendeth to the absolute impugnation of oathes, in some causes <hi>criminall:</hi> so is there not any point, which we doe not willingly embrace, and like of. For the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerie</hi> being a court (by the institution whereof) to handle by <hi>Bill</hi> and <hi>answere</hi> in <hi>English,</hi> no crimes but <hi>ciuilly</hi> laide, and not <hi>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minally</hi> mooued, to the intents of any punishment: vnto which <hi>Bill,</hi> the <hi>defendants</hi> must answere vpon their oathes: therefore it is no marueile, when (by Statute) any new authoritie is giuen therunto, as in this case; that then the course of the <hi>common lawe</hi> should be folowed; except such <hi>Statute</hi> do otherwise determine. But hereupon might well be gathered, that defendants oathes to <hi>English Billes</hi> (there alwayes vsed) albeit <hi>criminall</hi> matters touching their shame and dishonestie, be diduced; and in other courts thereunto authorized, the continuall vse of such oathes, euen for <hi>crimes criminally</hi> mooued: are no way, against the <hi>Lawe of the land.</hi> For we see, that it is here yeelded to be lawfull, in case the <hi>Chancerie</hi> had <hi>vsed</hi> such course afore. Also that it is v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall and lawfull in the <hi>Starre-chamber:</hi> and that these <hi>Iudges</hi>
                        <pb n="83" facs="tcp:19125:202"/>
opinions reach no further; but that the partie <hi>accused</hi> of <hi>periu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> should not be <hi>examined</hi> by oath, vpon <hi>Interrogatories</hi> in the <hi>Chancerie,</hi> for answering of <hi>Interrogatories</hi> vpon oath, is not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed there; no not when the <hi>crime</hi> is but <hi>ciuilly</hi> prosecuted; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the other partie will be contented, to be wholy concluded by his aduersaries answeres, that shall be so made, to his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories.</hi>

All that I can (to any such effect) hit vpon; is onely this marginall note, viz. <hi>Simile M. 18. fol. per Hynde qui noluit iurare coram Iusticiarijs ecclesiasticis, super articulos pro v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sura.</hi> so that if this be the place; being but a <hi>Marginall note,</hi> it can not (necessarily) be fathered, as a Report of the <hi>Lord Dyers;</hi> the rather, because it is not likely that he would terme <hi>ecclesiastical Commissioners,</hi> by the name of <hi>Iusticiarij ecclesiastici.</hi> for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitnes thereof it might seeme rather, to bee some note of the <hi>Notegatherers</hi> owne, then any of Iudge <hi>Dyers</hi> gathering. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, here is no mention of <hi>Hindes commitment,</hi> nor of <hi>corpus cum causa,</hi> nor that the sayd <hi>writ</hi> (vpon information) was graun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of that <hi>court of common Pleas:</hi> so that these bee but the <hi>Notegatherers</hi> owne surmises and gesses. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it might bee inferred thereof, that the Iustices then were <hi>of opinion, that Commissioners Ecclesiasticall might not giue any oathe in a matter of vsurie;</hi> and so by like reason (as h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>He affirmeth also: that <hi>the practisers of such oathes, are for that cause in a Pramunire;</hi> and therefore gathereth, the oathe to be <hi>contrary</hi> and <hi>repugnant</hi> to the <hi>common lawe.</hi> I graunt the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to be good and sound: but how doth hee prooue them to be thereupon in a <hi>Praemunire?</hi> For proofe of this, he assumeth; that this manner of <hi>oathe</hi> is contrary to the <hi>Queenes regalitie and crowne.</hi> as if his reasons afore brought, had sufficiently euinced so much, which wee doe vtterly and resolutely deny vnto him. And yet, as if he had fully cleared that point; he addresseth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to prooue that; whereof there was lesse controuersie, viz. that what is done by a <hi>Bishop,</hi> or by an <hi>Ecclesiasticall Court,</hi> against the <hi>Kings regalitie and crowne,</hi> hath beene heretofore adiudged to be within the compasse of this worde <hi>Alibi,</hi> contained in the Statute of <hi>Praemuuire</hi> 16. <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. For this he alledgeth two books of the common law: yet <note n="1" place="margin">5. Ed. 4. sol. 6.

For the <hi>Bishops</hi> then, did not claime their <hi>Iurisdictions Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall,</hi> next, and immediately vnder God, from the <hi>Crowne,</hi> as now they doe. But seeing this parte of <hi>Regall power</hi> is nowe no lesse truely and fully vested in the crowne, then is the <hi>Temporall;</hi> so as the Lawes allowed for the gouernement <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> are termed by sundry <hi>Parliaments, The Queenes Ecclesiastical lawes,</hi> and, <hi>Lawes of the Realme;</hi> as well as those which were first and

                     <p>Therefore (seeing this is not pregnant ynough for him) to driue this matter neerer home to his purpose; hee sayeth it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Kings Regalitie,</hi> and so a <hi>Praemunire for an Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Court to holde plea of a matter appertaining to the Iudgement of a Common Lawe Court, or to deale in any cause not belonging to Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Iurisdiction.</hi>

                     <p>The first of these he prooueth; by the pardon sued by <hi>Barlow</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bathe</hi> and <hi>Welles</hi> in king <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. his time; by reason hee had depriued the <hi>Deane</hi> there, being a meere <hi>donatiue</hi> of the <hi>Kings.</hi> If there were but any probable doubt, whether (thereby) hee were fallen into a <hi>Praemunire;</hi> it was wisedome for him, to procure a pardon (afore hand) if he could. <hi>Alealitis, resin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certissima.</hi> yet depriuing of one, placed by the <hi>King;</hi> is much more then bare holding of some plea, that appertaineth to a <hi>temporall</hi> Court: besides that there was a further matter in it, then I last here to open.</p>

The other allegation of his to like ende; taken from a <note n="1" place="margin">38. Ed. 3. of Prouisours.</note> 
                        <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,</hi> doth make no shew of proofe thereof: for it is but thus, viz. <hi>the King chiefly desireth to susteine his people in tranquilitie and peace, and to gouerne according to the Lawes, Usages, and Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chises of his land, as hee is bound by his oathe, made at his coronation.</hi> And are not <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> persons nowe parte of the <hi>Queenes</hi> people?

What cause is there then, seeing <hi>seu Alibi</hi> in the Statute; signifieth (in true construction) anie place whatsoeuer besides <hi>Rome:</hi> that euery holding <hi>plea</hi> by an <hi>Ecclesiasticall Court</hi> of a matter wherein it ought not to holde; shoulde at this time bee reckoned, a thing contrarie to the <hi>Queeenes Regalitie;</hi> more then dealing in an <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> cause, shoulde bee in anie <hi>temporall</hi> Court at <hi>Westminster?</hi> For no Statute of <hi>Prouision</hi> or <hi>Praemunire,</hi> assigneth these for cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; which haue (indeede) but growen since by collections; whiles the <hi>Popes vsurpation</hi> was continued in this land; against which (oftentimes) the remedie by <hi>Prohibition,</hi> coulde not serue the turne.

Neuerthelesse, all these matters are wholly impertinent to his purpose, till he shall haue prooued; the particular issue, viz. that such oathe (as wee treate of) is against the <hi>Queenes Regalitie, &amp;c.</hi> But if that might be prooued; then vpon so generall inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of <hi>Alibi;</hi> these oathes would fall into the case of <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire;</hi> by what <hi>Court</hi> soeuer, whether <hi>temporall</hi> or <hi>Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,</hi> they should be tendered.</p>

These collections he maketh partly from <hi>examples</hi> past; and partly at large. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore touching the first of these two: he impugneth these oathes, and would prooue the <hi>Imposers</hi> of them to be in a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> for <hi>incroching vpon the Kings rights and prerogatiues: and for conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting subiects by forrein made Lawes:</hi> and <hi>for practising Antichristi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Decrees, and Popish Canons:</hi> which (hee sayeth) appeareth, by the <hi>Praemunire</hi> brought by <hi>Hunne,</hi> against a <hi>person</hi> suing the said <hi>Hunne</hi> for his yoong deceased infants bearing-cloth (by the name of a Mortuarie) in an <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> Court. howe doth this inferre, that it is <hi>Praemunire;</hi> either <hi>to encroch vpon the Kings rights &amp; prerogatiues,</hi> (though this peraduenture by some circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may amounte sometimes to no lesse) or to conuent subiects by foreine made lawes? It may not be thought, that euery <hi>intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, deteiner,</hi> or <hi>concealement</hi> (which is incroching vpon the <hi>Kings right)</hi> or rauishment of his wardes, which hee ought to haue by his <hi>Prerogatiue Royall;</hi> is straightway, and necessarilie a <hi>Praemunire.</hi> neither were the <hi>Kings Temporall Courtes</hi> (in this case) encroched vpon; because they could not giue remedie for deteining a <hi>Mortuary,</hi> if this were so (in trueth) to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. neither yet is there so much as any mention made of <hi>foreine lawes,</hi> which the <hi>Ecclesiasticall Court</hi> then proceeded by, or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised.</p>
                     <p>This course of the <hi>Treatisour,</hi> is rather to prophesie, then to reason; thus to tell vs afore hand, vpon the very bringing of the action of <hi>Praemunire</hi> by <hi>Hunne:</hi> what the <hi>iudgement</hi> was in that matter yea, and vpon what ground the iudgement was giuen in a cause, which neuer receiued <hi>iudgement,</hi> for any thing I can learne.</p>
                     <p>To this point, he also mentioneth the <hi>Praemunire</hi> wherein blind <hi>Nixe</hi> sometimes Bishop of <hi>Norwich,</hi> was condemned, and addeth to the aforesaid two points; that by that also appeareth; <hi>Iudges Ecclesiasticall</hi> are in <hi>Praemunire, whensoeuer they exceede their Iudiciall authority.</hi> But if euery exceeding of authoritie were a <hi>Praemunire;</hi> then what <hi>Iudge</hi> is there of any <hi>court</hi> (of either sort) so skilfull, or alwayes so aduised; but might iustly feare that at one time or other he shall not escape this rigorous doom of <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire?</hi> In trueth, this <hi>example</hi> prooueth all his three points, iust

                     <p>Whereby wee may see, that <hi>encroching vpon the Kings rights, &amp;c.</hi> is not heere specially assigned, for any cause of such <hi>iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> and much lesse, is the <hi>practising</hi> of any <hi>Canons,</hi> or <hi>forreine made Lawes;</hi> for they are not once mentioned: and least of all, that euery <hi>exceeding of their authoritie by any Court,</hi> shoulde be a <hi>Praemunire.</hi> For the <hi>originall</hi> and onely cause hereof was; the <hi>B.</hi> enioyning of the <hi>Maior,</hi> and of another townesman of <hi>Thetford,</hi> vpon paine of <hi>censures;</hi> to <hi>adnull and make voyde a presentment, first duly made, in a temporall Court of the Kings.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>That which the <hi>Treatisour</hi> collecteth by <hi>Cardinall Wolseys Praemunire,</hi> and the whole Cleargies also; for assenting to, and assisting the Court <hi>Legatiue,</hi> which the saide <hi>Wolsey</hi> had ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; hee himselfe doth sufficiently confute: for albeit hee doe affirme; that <hi>Wolsey</hi> was in a <hi>Praemunire for preiudicing but eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Courtes, and not the Kings;</hi> and thence gathereth thus: <hi>How much more those, which practise Antichristian Lawes, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Canons, repugnant to the royall Matestie, and policie of this laend?</hi> yet doeth hee (by implication) contrary his owne saide
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19125:206"/>
affirmatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; in that he confesseth, <hi>Wolsey did grant benefices</hi> by way of <hi>Prouision.</hi> for thereby, he was within the very letter of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of <hi>Prouision,</hi> and <hi>Praemunire;</hi> and so consequently, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudiced also <hi>the Kings regalitie and crowne, and not Ecclesiasticall courts alone.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Yea, and what is all this to the imposing of an oathe, that we treate of? seeing (if it were true, that euery practise of <hi>Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian decrees,</hi> and <hi>Popish Canons,</hi> were a <hi>Praemunire)</hi> yet it may be truely affirmed, that the very <hi>temporall</hi> Lawes of this Realme, do allow vnto <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> Courts to minister such <hi>oathes</hi> (as shall be prooued in the next chapter) &amp; therefore not to be said to be practised by vertue of <hi>Canons</hi> only. And also, for that no <hi>Canons,</hi> that are agreeing to those conditions, and qualities which are required by the <note n="1" place="margin">25. H. 8. 27. H. 8.</note> Statute of <hi>Submission of the Cleargie,</hi> are <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian,</hi> or <hi>Popish,</hi> or <hi>foreine Lawes;</hi> but are the <hi>Queenes Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Lawes, and Lawes of this Realme;</hi> no lesse then such as were <hi>originally</hi> made within the land, as is afore (by occasion) <note n="2" place="margin">Vide 1. part. ca. 14. pag. 102. &amp; 103.</note> shewed and prooued. Insomuch, as the <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> himselfe calleth them <hi>the ecclesiasticall Lawes of England.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Hee also telleth vs, as to this purpose of a complaint by the Commons made <hi>21. H. 8.</hi> vnto the said King touching grieuan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by the Clergie offered: but telleth not, that it was this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; nor how iust or vniust the complaint was found to be; nor yet of any remedy therein giuen. He discourseth also of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of an other complaint likewise made <hi>23. H. 8.</hi> but hee doth not assigne <hi>oathes</hi> tendered in some <hi>criminall</hi> matter, to be any part of that complaint. The <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> saith, the <hi>L. Aud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> then chosen <hi>Speaker,</hi> did exhibite it; and that it was for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>ex officio:</hi> albeit the <hi>Treatisour</hi> do tell vs, of many points besides; which (belike) if he had pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ned that complaint, it should haue conteined: This I haue answered in the second part of this <hi>Apologie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another reason by way of collection, the <hi>Treatisor</hi> maketh at large thus, viz. <hi>What if a Iustice by colour of his office, should offer this generall othe, to answer to all he will aske, &amp; commit the partie refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing; coulde any man iustifie his doing; but rather crie out against him, as a subuerter, &amp;c?</hi> Well, howe strange a course soeuer hee maketh this, and therefore so <hi>cryeth out;</hi> neuerthelesse it may bee, that little better hath beene vsed by some <hi>Iustices</hi> of <hi>Peace.</hi>
                        <pb n="92" facs="tcp:19125:207"/>
But I neither accuse any thereof, nor wil excuse either them or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, which shal so deale; either from the <hi>Treatisors,</hi> or from any other mans <hi>outcries:</hi> so that (in this point) we both agree.</p>
                     <p>But in one part of his <hi>Treatise;</hi> he gathereth also thus, against practising of <hi>Canons,</hi> in ministring <hi>oath: No Canons</hi> 
                        <note n="1" place="margin">25. H. 8. ca. 19.</note> 
                        <hi>may be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised but such, as be not contrary nor repugnant to the Prerogatiue royall, nor to the lawes and Customes of this Realme: but this Canon Law, is not any part or portion of such lawes.</hi> Whereupon it seemeth he would haue his Reader to conclude; that no <hi>Canon</hi> at al may be practised. First it is vntrue (if you take the <hi>Canon</hi> Law inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely for all <hi>Canons)</hi> absolutely and indistinctly to say; that it is no <hi>portion of the Lawes and Customes of this Realme,</hi> as hath bin afore shewed. yea, there was here an <hi>vse</hi> and <hi>custome</hi> thereof, long afore it was accounted <hi>any parte of the Lawe of the Realme.</hi> Secondly there be <hi>quatuor termini</hi> in this reason. Lastly, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth all of <hi>Negatiues;</hi> In both which respects, it is vtterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concludent.</p>
                     <p>So that by all hitherto deliuered wee may perceiue; that albeit there bee some <hi>diuersitie</hi> in sundrie the courses of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, betwixt the <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> and the <hi>temporall</hi> Lawes: yet there is found not so much as any great <hi>diuersitie</hi> in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point; which is of ministring <hi>oathes in certaine criminall cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses:</hi> and much lesse, is there any <hi>contrarietie</hi> or <hi>repugnancie</hi> in that behalfe.</p>
                     <p>Besides, there is not so great <hi>diuersitie,</hi> betwixt any part of the law <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> (being now of force within this Realme) and the Lawes <hi>temporall;</hi> as is betwixt sundrie points of the customs of <hi>London,</hi> the customes of the <hi>Stannerie,</hi> the customes of <hi>Kent,</hi> the customes of <hi>Halifax,</hi> both in trying and executing offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, and by dealing by vertue of the <hi>Queenes Instructions</hi> at the <hi>Counsell</hi> of the <hi>Marches</hi> of <hi>Wales,</hi> on the one side: and betwixt sundry parts of the <hi>Common lawe,</hi> on the other side: as might (but for auoiding of tediousnes) by sundry particulars, be exe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plified. &amp; yet none of those which practise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; are by reason of any such notable <hi>diuersity</hi> only, thus threatned with danger of <hi>Praemunire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the last ranke of matters brought by him to this purpose; I doe marshall the <hi>Treatisours</hi> shifting answeres, vnto such <hi>obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions;</hi> as himselfe imagineth will be, or may be made by those,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19125:207"/>
who defend this kinde of oathe, whereof we are now treating.</p>
                     <p>First, to the <hi>obiection</hi> made, of the <hi>like oathes ministred to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants in causes criminall, both in the Courts of Starre-chamber and Chancerie:</hi> he answereth, that, <hi>if it were graunted, that the like oathes be there vsed: yet would it not followe, that the same might be practised in courts Ecclesiasticall.</hi> and why would it not followe? <hi>vnlesse</hi> (sayth he) <hi>the like allowance thereto, and consent of the whole Realme, might be prooued.</hi> Belike, if it were not most euident; he would also denie the like <hi>oaths</hi> to be vsed in those two courts. The <hi>whole Realme</hi> is sayde to allowe, and to consent vnto that, which is enacted by <hi>Parliament.</hi> Shall the same course then v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed also in the <hi>Chancerie,</hi> that hath none Acte of <hi>Parliament</hi> to establish it, be vnlawfull in his iudgement? for hee cannot say, that the <hi>whole Realme,</hi> either <hi>indeede</hi> or <hi>representatiuely</hi> hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen consent hereunto; albeit the <hi>prescription</hi> thereof be most ancient; because al &amp; euery one in particular, haue not had from time to time, <hi>iudiciall</hi> matters there. But yet, since this <hi>prescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is good; and will serue to mainteine that course there: why shall it not also alike serue for <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> courts, which haue reteined the practise of such <hi>oath,</hi> beyond all memorie of man, and beyond most <hi>Records</hi> nowe extant?</p>
                     <p>Neuerthelesse, there be also Acts of <hi>Parliament</hi> to warrant the practise of these <hi>oathes</hi> in <hi>courts Ecclesiasticall;</hi> vnlesse they could be prooued; to be either <hi>contrary or repugnant to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatiue Royall; or else to the Statutes, lawes and customes of this Realme.</hi> Neither yet are the examples of <hi>Starre-chamber</hi> and <hi>Chancerie,</hi> to any other ende by vs alleaged: but thereby one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to shewe; that such <hi>defendants oathes,</hi> inferring confession of some his owne <hi>crimes;</hi> is neither to be holden <hi>vniust, vnlawfull, vnequall, barbarous, cruell;</hi> nor yet <hi>Antichristian</hi> or <hi>Popish,</hi> as they be challenged.</p>
                     <p>For a second answere hereunto, he sayth: that, <hi>examples and Precedents be weake, where an expresse lawe, or certaine policie, is to the contrary.</hi> as if he should say, though these two high <hi>Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall courts</hi> doe practise it: yet is it <hi>contrary to an expresse lawe, or certaine policie.</hi> for else, he sayth iust nothing to the purpose. and yet he doth no lesse <hi>dutifully</hi> say it; then he prooues it <hi>substanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally;</hi> euen out of <hi>the Ciuill lawe.</hi> viz. <hi>ius non ex regula sumatur,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:19125:208"/>
sed ex iure quod est, regula fiat.</hi> I pray yee, who euer heard afore, that <hi>regula</hi> here signifieth an <hi>example,</hi> or a <hi>Precedent.</hi> The true vnderstanding therefore of that part of <hi>Ciuill</hi> lawe, is this: when many cases runne one way, so that (for roundnes, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter memories sake) they haue bene (by <hi>Iudicious</hi> men) contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued into a <hi>summarie rule:</hi> then whatsoeuer might be comprised vnder the generalitie of the words of such <hi>rule,</hi> was not straight way to be reckoned for <hi>lawe.</hi> because it is not possible (in this great weaknesse of mans wit) so to comprehend the lawe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to guide such infinite varietie of mens particular externall actions in a briefe <hi>rule;</hi> as that it shall not haue sundry <hi>excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>limitations:</hi> and therefore <hi>rarò est quin regula fallat.</hi> And againe in this place, <hi>non ex regula ius sumitur, &amp;c.</hi> that is, you can not conclude it necessarily to be <hi>lawe:</hi> because you may apply vnto it, some <hi>rule</hi> of lawe: but because the lawe runneth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly in sundry cases: you may therefore conueniently drawe them into a short <hi>rule,</hi> which some doe call <hi>maximes</hi> in lawe, yet abusiuely.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly he sayth to this obiection: that <hi>by better Logicke we might conclude</hi> thus, viz. <hi>because in these two courts, answeres bee put in vpon oath; therefore the same may be vsed in the Kings Bench, and common Pleas: which neuerthelesse were an absurde conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> No Sir, it is so farre from <hi>better,</hi> that it is not any <hi>Logicke</hi> at all so to conclude; except you adde more vnto it. for if you could truely adde, that the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> and <hi>common Pleas</hi> had time out of minde vsed that course for answeres to Billes in <hi>crimes</hi> not capital, nor tending to mutilation of limme; which may be verified of courts <hi>Ecclesiasticall,</hi> besides the direction of that lawe, by which they proceede: then, with very good <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke</hi> might you conclude thus: <hi>the same course hath time out of minde bene vsed in all those courts,</hi> and it is not <hi>vniust</hi> nor <hi>cruell</hi> &amp;c. in the one, and therefore not in the other. for the diuersitie of places where they sit, nor diuersitie of persons which doe sit as <hi>Iudges,</hi> nor any other like circumstance; cannot make a matter <hi>iust</hi> and <hi>equall,</hi> if (in his owne nature and simply) it were <hi>vniust, cruell,</hi> or <hi>barbarous,</hi> as this is often by him, and others challenged to be.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly he sayth, that <hi>in the Starre-chamber, there is a bill of
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19125:208"/>
complaint formerly exhibited:</hi> and so be there <hi>Articles</hi> in an <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall</hi> court.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, that, <hi>there is also a knowen accuser:</hi> Not alwayes an <hi>accuser;</hi> for the <hi>office</hi> or common <hi>Interest</hi> of the <hi>Prince</hi> (whose the court is) oftentimes is there excited &amp; stirred vp by her <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties Atturney</hi> or <hi>Solicitour;</hi> without any danger of them, to be punished, or condemned in charges, though the matter should not fall out fully against the defendants: euen as it is in <hi>courtes Ecclesiasticall,</hi> when they proceede of <hi>Office.</hi> albeit these more often proceede, hauing a priuate <hi>Prosecutour</hi> (especially in the court of <hi>Commission)</hi> then they doe <hi>ex mero officio.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixtly; that, <hi>in the Starre-chamber, they haue a copie of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint:</hi> yet he himselfe doeth limit it thus, viz. so it be not <hi>ore te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> Well then (vpon some good occasion) it is none vniustice; though the defendant want a <hi>copie</hi> altogether, of the matter ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, but in all <hi>ordinarie</hi> courts, and in the <hi>Commission Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall</hi> (at the furthest when they haue answered the articles) they haue <hi>copies</hi> of them.</p>
                     <p>Seuenthly, <hi>in the Starre-chamber, the defendants are allowed counsell in answering the Bill:</hi> and yet, when this is <hi>ore tenus,</hi> he knoweth they cannot haue counsell, neither are they there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed any counsell for answering to <hi>Interrogatories;</hi> nor yet to haue a copy of them, til they haue fully answered to them. which <hi>Interrogatories</hi> vpon <hi>crimes</hi> in that court, haue a correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence vnto <hi>articles criminall,</hi> preferred in <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> courts.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, (sayth he) <hi>in the Starre-chamber, if the Interrogatories be impertinent; the defendant (without offence) may refuse to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere them:</hi> and so may he refuse also to answere such <hi>articles</hi> in an <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> court. But who shall then iudge, whether they be impertinent, or not? shall the partie himselfe? no verily, but, (as it is in the <hi>Starre-chamber)</hi> the court it selfe: or else some of them that are skilfull in lawe; being thereunto required by the rest.</p>
                     <p>Whereupon, what great difference there is in any <hi>circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> much lesse in matter of <hi>substance,</hi> betwixt the procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings in these courtes, may easily be considered: howsoeuer he doe largely conclude thereupon (after his olde maner) that there be <hi>mightie</hi> and <hi>great</hi> dissimilitudes. For in his conclusion hereof,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:19125:209"/>
he encludeth also other differences more bitterly, and not spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of at all in any his premisses, whereupon he inferreth it, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit that such his additions be also very vntrue: as that, <hi>Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall courts giue oathes without all course of iudgement: that the oathes there, are made suddenly, without all discretion; vpon vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine demaunds: that their oathes doe foolishly wander, at the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full will of a subtil and slye opposer: and that the oathe in Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall courtes, constraineth the reuealing of wordes, deedes, and thoughts, though neuer offensiue to any.</hi> Belike then, where others be <hi>offended,</hi> he mindes and will not sticke to allowe vnto those courts, the ministring euen of these <hi>generall oathes:</hi> which he so often (besides the purpose) harpeth vpon.</p>
                     <p>Let vs then lay aside these imputations (being vtterly vntrue) which hee coucheth together in his conclusion, made of this point, viz. concerning the like course obiected to be vsed in the <hi>Starre-chamber.</hi> what then doe all, or any the former <hi>differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of proceeding by him noted; betwixt the <hi>Starre-chamber,</hi> and <hi>courts Ecclesiasticall</hi> make, to prooue the vnlawfulnesse of ministring an <hi>oath</hi> in a <hi>criminall</hi> cause, which is the matter one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in issue here betwixt vs? yea, though they were admitted to bee (indeede) <hi>differences,</hi> which is shewed, to bee farre other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise? For albeit, these courts should differ in many other points, yet such <hi>difference</hi> cannot prooue an equitie to bee in the very like <hi>oath,</hi> when it is vsed in the <hi>Starre-chamber,</hi> and an iniquitie to be in it, when an <hi>Ecclesiasticall court</hi> doeth (in the like case) minister it. Truely, he might out of those differences as wel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude thus: the <hi>Starre-chamber</hi> is kept, and the oath is ministred at <hi>Westminster:</hi> and they haue in that court, but three or foure <hi>Atturneys:</hi> therefore the very like <hi>oath</hi> ministred in the <hi>Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storie at Paules,</hi> where there be a dozen <hi>Procurators</hi> sometimes present, is <hi>vniust,</hi> and vnequall. This therefore falleth into that point, which (in the Epistle to the Reader) I affirmed to be his <hi>sophisticall</hi> answering of <hi>obiections.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He also doubteth, that the Statute authorizing <hi>the attaching of heretikes by Ordinaries,</hi> made 2. H. 4. ca. 15. which he termeth, <hi>the twise damned, and repealed Statute, and a bloody and boyling lawe:</hi> will be alleaged, for proofe of these oathes. In trueth wee should be brought to a very straite exigend; if we were forced
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:19125:209"/>
(as he is) to runne vnto such <hi>repealed statutes,</hi> for proofe of any principall point in controuersie.</p>
                     <p>Yet let vs see howe he assayeth to vntye this knot; which he doeth two wayes. First he sayth, <hi>it appeareth not; that thereby any authoritie was giuen to impose any such generall oath.</hi> if then no such thing <hi>appeare,</hi> why doth the <hi>Notegatherer,</hi> so confidently, <note place="margin">Repugnancie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisour and Note<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatherer.</note> and so often affirme; that this <hi>oath</hi> was then first brought in and established: and therefore hee calleth that, the statute <hi>ex officio,</hi> though <hi>ex officio</hi> or oath be not once named there? thereby confounding the very course of proceeding, with that one <hi>Act</hi> thereof, viz. of <hi>ministring an oath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Treatisour</hi> goeth further, and sayth; <hi>it appeareth not, that any authoritie was thereby giuen, to compell by oath, the prisoner to become his owne Accuser: for that (and especially in causes of life and death) had bene against the lawes and iustice of the land.</hi> By which restraint in this worde <hi>(especially)</hi> he seemeth little lesse then to yeelde, that in other cases not <hi>capitall;</hi> this oath is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>lawes,</hi> nor <hi>iustice of the land.</hi> But it is very vntrue to thinke, that whatsoeuer is wholly forborne in Temporal courts, should therfore (straight way) be accounted to be against them. For there is great difference betwixt <hi>not vsing,</hi> or forbearing, and plaine <hi>forbidding</hi> of a thing to be done.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, we are commanded in <note n="1" place="margin">1. Pet. ca. 3. ver. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>Scripture, to be ready to giue an account to euery one that asketh vs a reason, of the hope that is in vs, with meeknes and feare.</hi> If to euery one, much more to a <hi>Magistrate.</hi> What then if he (hauing also authoritie to impose oathes) will exact it in this case? may he not as lawfully doe it, as without oath, he may aske and <hi>interrogate</hi> the partie? Nowe it is no more lawfull before God, for vs (being but asked of <hi>our fayth, or hope,</hi> euen by a priuate man) to dally with him, or to say vntruly, though it might saue our life: then wee may say vntruly, when wee be sworne to tell the trueth thereof vnto a <hi>Magistrate.</hi> 
                        <note n="2" place="margin">Ecclesiast. 4. ver. 30.</note> 
                        <hi>doe not gaine say the trueth in any case</hi> (saith the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:) and againe, <hi>be</hi> 
                        <note n="3" place="margin">Ecclesiast. 41. ver. 21.</note> 
                        <hi>ashamed of vntrueth before a Magistrate; or a man in authoritie.</hi> So that hereupon it may seeme, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Gods lawe;</hi> to set any man at libertie from answering true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, touching his <hi>fayth</hi> and <hi>hope;</hi> and so in <hi>heresie:</hi> when, howe, and by whomsoeuer, he shalbe <hi>interrogated;</hi> yea though danger of
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:19125:210"/>
                        <hi>death</hi> might ensue thereby vnto him.</p>
                     <p>His second answere to that statute, is, that, <hi>if this oath be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed vnder the worde of Canonicall sanctions, mentioned in that statute, then was it no binding law; nor gaue sufficient authoritie, &amp;c. because all lawes of man, repugnant to the lawe of God, are meerely voyd.</hi> Where he assumeth as graunted; that this oath is <hi>repugnant to Gods law,</hi> which shal (God willing) be prooued far otherwise.</p>
                     <p>The last point, which to this purpose he supposeth wil be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, is; that, <hi>the kings heretofore haue graunted Commissions to examine by oath.</hi> This, <hi>he thinketh, cannot be prooued: and though it could; yet</hi> (sayth he) <hi>such Commissions are against law, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore voyde.</hi> Therefore, vntill they be prooued to be herein <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst lawe,</hi> this answere will fall to nought; and the obiection will remaine till then good and sound. And so I ende this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Chapter, made in answer of all that which I finde brought for proofe; that these oathes (whereof we argue) should be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie</hi> or <hi>repugnant,</hi> vnto the <hi>statutes, common lawe, or customes</hi> of this <hi>Realme.</hi>

                     <p>We do onely say, that the defendant may lawfully be vrged, in due proceeding <hi>of office</hi> to answere concerning some <hi>crimes</hi> of his owne, by vertue of his oathe.

                     <p>These proofes (last alleadged) are gathered out of Writtes of <hi>Consultation,</hi> after that (by the parties conuented) <hi>Prohibitions</hi> had beene brought, to remooue the causes from <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> Courts.

For, can any be so simple, as once to imagine, that a man who is <hi>cited</hi> to answere, in a cause <hi>criminall,</hi> and to be punished or corrected for it, will willingly appeare and answere; if hee neede not to come at all, and were therein also, by Lawe protected?

                        </hi> to stay the dealing; where he is willing enough to be proceeded with?</p>
                     <p>But besides allowance hereof, by the <hi>Statutes</hi> and <hi>Common Lawe</hi> vnto Courtes <hi>ecclesiasticall;</hi> the <hi>practise</hi> also by time imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall hath runne accordingly; as may positiuely appeare by <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> Courts, and (by way of <hi>abnegation)</hi> may be shewed from the <hi>Recordes</hi> at the common Lawe. In that (as I thinke) it will not in them be found; that any <hi>Prohibition</hi> (hath vpon this point onely) beene awarded thence: or at least, vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on debate for obtaining of a <hi>Consultation,</hi> such hath not stoode, nor beene mainteined.</p>

                     <p>By al which here premised it doth appeare, how sufficiently &amp; manifoldly our intention (in this behalf) is grounded: &amp; likewise to how smal purpose the <hi>Treatisor</hi> resoneth, where he gathereth; <hi>that ecclesiast. courts must be restrained by the Q. prerogatiue roial, &amp; common lawes, in that their iurisdiction is from the Crown.</hi> Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, none of the defenders of this oath wil deny, either the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent,</hi> or <hi>consequence</hi> hereof.

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law doth;</hi> wil not any way follow thereupon: because the <hi>Q. prerogatiue royall,</hi> and <hi>common lawes,</hi> are so farre from restraining
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:19125:215"/>
or forbidding these oathes; that (as it hath beene prooued) they allow them. and the <hi>Temporall Courts</hi> (in many like cases) vse not so much as a different course from this; which is in speciall controuersie.</p>
                     <p>Now if it shall be said, which also some very learned men do hold (as the <hi>Treatisour</hi> confesseth) that the Statute law made the first of her <hi>Maiestie,</hi> warranteth, and alloweth this manner of <hi>oathe:</hi> then to shew this to be (as he conceiueth it) absurde; hee telleth vs of some other points also defended (vpon the generall words of that <hi>Acte,</hi> and of the <hi>Commission)</hi> by the saide <hi>learned men;</hi> which seeme vnto him to be also no lesse absurdities, then is the ministring an oath in a cause <hi>criminall;</hi> &amp; therfore the one no better warranted thereby, then the other, for to what other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose then this, he should bring them, I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not possibly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iecture.</p>
                     <p>The first fault he findeth with such <hi>learned mens</hi> sayings, is: for that they iudge it to be warranted by <hi>the Act, and by the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mission to put men to othes; none accusation, sute, or lawful informatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or indictment, iudicially preceeding, or depending.</hi> He may fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vpon such <hi>learned men</hi> what he please: but is it likely that he himself would thus obiect; as if he required bils of <hi>Information</hi> &amp; Inditements (as it is at the <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon law)</hi> to be vsed also in <hi>courts ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical,</hi> seing both himselfe, and the <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> do tie the Commission to causes only <hi>ecclesiastical,</hi> and they also to be dealt in, only <hi>ecclesiastically?</hi> Such learned me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s sayings, may wel &amp; tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be defended: as namely, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> either the offence is <hi>notorious,</hi> or is knowen to the <hi>Iudges</hi> themselues, to be dangerous &amp; <hi>scandalous</hi> to be suffered. For these two cases be out of all those that hee na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth: yea though he should (most vniuersally) take <hi>suite</hi> for any prosecution by another, and <hi>information</hi> for any priuate credible <hi>suggestion,</hi> or <hi>denunciation</hi> made.</p>
                     <p>The second errour which he assigneth to be holden by them: is, for that, <hi>secret information may be admitted, suppresso nomine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificantis:</hi> and he calleth such <hi>informations, secret accusations,</hi> and the men <hi>malicious calumniators:</hi> adding, that <hi>all good lawes, and well gouerned common wealths, haue such hidden backbyters, for ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant accusers.</hi> But if <hi>all good Lawes and well gouerned common-weales do (indeed) hold such men for apparant accusers;</hi> then doth it follow; that, when such <hi>Information</hi> is giuen, there is no want of
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:19125:215"/>
an <hi>apparant accusation.</hi> Yet in very deede, euery <hi>relation</hi> made to a <hi>Magistrate</hi> by such, as will not prosecute, nor (perhaps) bee seene in the cause, for some good consideration; is not by any <hi>law,</hi> nor in any <hi>common weale</hi> that I know of; holden for an <hi>accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation,</hi> for a <hi>malitious calumniation,</hi> or for any <hi>secret backbiting,</hi> nor yet deseruedly (by any necessitie) is so to bee accounted. For besides other countreys which I haue read of; such priuate infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations haue (oftentimes) their manifolde good vse, euen in this <hi>Realme,</hi> yea and amongs ech degree of <hi>Magistrates.</hi> And if they should be <note n="1" place="margin">Vide 2. part, pag. 85.</note> wholy reiected, or neglected; might (sometime) bring an whole subuersion vnto vs all.</p>
                     <p>I pray, were those that gaue the first <hi>information</hi> of <hi>Babingtons</hi> damnable conspiracie, to be misliked, as <hi>secret backbiters?</hi> or was the <hi>examination</hi> of these traitors, and the proceedings vniust; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the names of the intelligence-giuers, were to this day sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed? By this example then you may wey, &amp; consider, of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry the like. Howbeit such <hi>informations</hi> in <hi>ordinarie</hi> courtes <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall,</hi> be not holden for sufficient ground of <hi>Speciall Enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;</hi> except they be very frequent, and the offence <hi>scandalous:</hi> and in <hi>Commssion courtes,</hi> they bee as rarely receiued, as in any courts <hi>Temporall</hi> of this Realme whatsoeuer, and then but from very great, and credible persons.</p>
                     <p>The third fault he findeth with such <hi>learnedmens</hi> opinions, is; that, <hi>the Iudge may professe himselfe to be an Accuser: which lawlesse proceeding, the Iustice of this land</hi> (he saith) <hi>detesteth:</hi> for that <hi>no man may be accuser, and witnes:</hi> or <hi>Inditour,</hi> and a <hi>Iurour: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much lesse may the Iudge be an Accuser.</hi> For answere where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, first the lawes <hi>ciuill</hi> and <hi>ecclesiasticall,</hi> holde not the <hi>Iudge</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>of office</hi> to be any <hi>accuser:</hi> but that whereupon the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry</hi> is grounded, to represent the <hi>accusation,</hi> and so there is no need for them to pleade such plea, as he here surmiseth. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that, <hi>an accuser</hi> may (in some case and sort) be a witnes, &amp;c. is <note n="2" place="margin">Vide 2. part. pag. 110. &amp; 111.</note> elsewhere declared: and so his <hi>antecedent</hi> false. Thirdly, his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son foloweth not: for why might not a <hi>Iudge</hi> be an <hi>accuser:</hi> albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it neither an <hi>accuser</hi> could be a <hi>witnesse,</hi> nor the <hi>Inditour</hi> a <hi>Iurour?</hi> Fourthly, if it were true, that the <hi>Iustice of this land,</hi> and the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lawe</hi> did not vse something, which an <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> court doeth: may it thereupon bee inferred, that therein is a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarietie,</hi>
                        <pb n="110" facs="tcp:19125:216"/>
and thereby (for such <hi>difference</hi> onely) a detestation of the other course? This maner of reasoning is more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon with him &amp; others, in these causes; then any way sound &amp; substantial. For the one court <hi>doeth it,</hi> &amp; the other <hi>doeth it not,</hi> be no <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;</hi> nor yet <hi>propositions</hi> in any other degree of <hi>opposition:</hi> in that, <hi>subiectum propositionis</hi> in both, is not the same, and therefore doe import no more, but a <hi>diuersity.</hi> For is this (which is the very like) any good reason, viz. an <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> court readeth <hi>dissinitiue</hi> sentences <hi>de scripto,</hi> but a <hi>Temporall</hi> court doeth it not, in giuing iudgement, therefore there is <hi>contrarietie</hi> betwixt these courts? &amp; so the reading <hi>de scripto,</hi> in a court <hi>ecclesiastical</hi> vtterly vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full? Whereof I thought it not amisse, once for all to aduertise the Reader, because this erroneous argument is so vsuall.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, if all these were to be graunted vnto the <hi>Treatisour,</hi> euen as he setteth them down; yet what would it auaile his cause? For admit these collections were <hi>absurdly</hi> gathered, from the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the words of the <hi>Act</hi> &amp; <hi>Commission;</hi> would it therefore fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that authority, to minister oaths to defenda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts <hi>in causes crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> could not thence be argued without absurdities, being whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly another point? why? if euery thing cannot well be inferred thereon, may therefore nothing at all be? Yet vpon these &amp; such like <hi>speeches,</hi> rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>reasons</hi> of his, (elsewhere by sundry occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions touched) the <hi>Treatisour</hi> wisheth; <hi>the said learned men wiselier to aduise these Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missioners ecclesiastical, to respect the ends expressed in the statute, viz. the pleasure of God, increase of vertue, conseruation of peace and vnitie of this Realme: rather then the ample and large words of the statute, and height of their Iurisdiction,</hi> as if these ends, could not possibly concurre, with tender of such oaths. But whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer, he, or any other learned or vnlearned, haue sufficiently (indeed) prooued, that these cannot stand together; I doubt not, but that the <hi>Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>missioners,</hi> wil take it, as a great benefit, to haue bin instructed by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a point touching <hi>the pleasure of God, increase of vertue, &amp; conseruation of vnitie;</hi> which by most of their large trauels in <hi>Diuinitie,</hi> by themselues they haue not hitherto fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. Howbeit, this last part of his saying seemeth vnto me to sound; as if he would not stick any more, to grant vnto vs, that <hi>the large words of the Act</hi> doe allow of this oath. So that we finde nothing any way materiall by him alleaged, to impeach our former <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,</hi>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:19125:216"/>
viz. that <hi>the common lawes,</hi> and <hi>statutes</hi> of this Realme, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe such oaths to be tendered by <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Iudges. &amp; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the oath of the partie in some matter of crime, that may be <hi>da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mageable</hi> &amp; <hi>penal</hi> vnto him; is both in practise, &amp; is alowed also to be practised (in courts <hi>ecclesiastical)</hi> by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawes of this realme.</p>

                     <p>First, the <hi>lawes</hi> of the realme, that do allow certaine matters to be of <hi>ecclesiasticall</hi> conusance, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be intended, but to allow an <hi>ecclesiastical</hi> forme of proceeding, by such lawes receiued.

Therefore I holde it best to shewe vnto you, what is the lawe herein (agreeable also to the practise in <hi>ordinarie</hi> courts <hi>ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall)</hi> as I conceiue it; in as great briefnes, as I can. which may bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <p>An <hi>oath</hi> touching a <hi>criminall position,</hi> or <hi>matter,</hi> is either taken
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:19125:217"/>
by a <hi>witnes,</hi> or by a <hi>partie.</hi> A witnes (by the very nature of testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie) must depose indifferently, aswell for the partie against whom he is produced, as for him, which produceth him. And therefore is to answere truely, not onely to the <hi>positions</hi> and <hi>arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> giuen in by him, by whom he is produced: but also, vnto the lawfull and pertinent <hi>Interrogatories,</hi> ministred euen by the aduerse part. In which <hi>Interrogatories,</hi> two seuerall sortes of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may be conteined; tending to disable him, from giuing te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie. The first is an <hi>Interrogatorie</hi> tending to the discouerie of his owne turpitude: and <hi>vnto</hi> 
                        <note n="1" place="margin">Felinus in ca. cum causam. de testibus. nu. 10. per communem opinionem.</note> 
                        <hi>this, whether it concerne any crime supposed to be committed by the witnes, or his confession there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; or the fame and infamie against him of such crime; or a sentence thereof; or an excommunication</hi> (thereupon) <hi>gone out against him, or any such like matter; he is not bound to answer vpon his oath,</hi> though he haue done penance for it, and thereby be presumed, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.

                        <hi>an Officer of a Towne</hi> (as such, which be called in <hi>Italie Decani villarum) by prescript of some statute, be to denounce al misdemeanors committed in that towne, vpon a grieuous punishment otherwise to bee inflicted vpon him: yet is hee not thereby bound, to present any secrete offence committed by himselfe.</hi> Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, I haue heard it in the forme of the oath (giuen to grand <hi>Iuries</hi> at <hi>Assises</hi> and <hi>Sessions)</hi> conteined; that they should <hi>enquire</hi> of their owne, their fellowes, and other mens misdemeanors, which they should haue in charge.</p>

                        <hi>Schooleman</hi> (by distinction) doth thus deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine of this poynt: <hi>If the Adulterie be altogether secret, a man is not bound iudicially to confesse his sinne: neither in this case, ought an oath of telling the trueth, to bee exacted of him: because hidden faults are reserued to Gods owne iudgement, according to the 1. Cor. 4. Chap. But when an euill fame runneth of adulterie committed, or when there appeare some euident tokens, which may induce great suspition thereof: or else when it is prooued Semiplene, that is, by one good witnesse, without exception: then ought an oath (to declare the trueth) to be imposed vpon him, and he is then bound to confesse the verie trueth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Another reason thereof is; that a <note n="4" place="margin">L. 8. §. 1. &amp; §. illud. quaeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. ff. de interrog.</note> 
                        <hi>Iudge</hi> may not interrogate <hi>iudicially:</hi> but where he is ledde thereunto by <hi>good equitie.</hi> But there is none equitie to <hi>enquire,</hi> of faultes that are absolutely <hi>secrete</hi> and <hi>hidden.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And yet there be also certaine cases, which are excepted out of this rule: The first <note n="5" place="margin">d. c. inquisition is Barthol. in d. l. Marcellus.

                     <p>An example <note n="6" place="margin">Conc.

                        <hi>exception</hi> of the aforesaide rule, touching not vrging to reueale <hi>secret</hi> faults; is: when as by concealing of the offence, great perill doth growe, to the <hi>Church,</hi> as in <hi>heresie,</hi> and <hi>dilapidating</hi> or spoyle and waste, of <hi>an Ecclesiasticall</hi> liuing.</p>
                     <p>If here it be asked, whether a partie be compellable to answere an <hi>Interrogatorie,</hi> or <hi>position</hi> touching his owne being <hi>excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated,</hi> or not? it is to be remembred, there be (in lawe) two kindes of <hi>excommunication:</hi> One is, <note n="4" place="margin">Specul. ibidem. nu. 42. &amp; 43.</note> 
                        <hi>excommunicatio Canonis,</hi> when as the law inflicteth that <hi>censure ipso facto:</hi> as (by statute) for fighting with drawen weapon in the <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Churchyard.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now because this censure so by law inflicted, is alwaies presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be iust, &amp; to binde: therefore, we are not bound (by oath) to answere vnto a <hi>position,</hi> or <hi>interrogatorie,</hi> diducing our owne being <hi>excommunicated;</hi> no more then we are, touching our <hi>secret</hi> faults.

Hitherto of offences meerely <hi>secrete.</hi> But when they are by <hi>signes</hi> or otherwise (in some lawful sort) manifested abroad, they are then of a farre different consideration.

To this effect, a <note n="1" place="margin">Alph. Villag. lib. Pract. Can. 1. cap. 5. conclu. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>Canonist</hi> writeth thus: <hi>Seeing God alone doth know, &amp; is Iudge of thoughts meerely secret: and that ech man is bound to preserue his owne good name, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of S. Augustines, viz. that man is cruell, who is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse of his good name: it doth thereupon follow, that if nothing at all be proued by the Accusour; that then a man is not bound to confesse anything against himselfe.</hi> And <note n="2" place="margin">Diaz. cap. 140.</note> another to like purpose, viz. <hi>albeit when the Iudge proceedeth of office, and the crime is not fully proued, he may enioyne purgation vnto the defendant: yet is he not bound to do it at the petition of him, who voluntarily offred himselfe</hi> to be <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motor officij: but it is otherwise, when a necessarie promotour, who is assigned by the Iudge, doth make such petition.</hi>

Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reason is, for that hee is not hereby accounted <hi>to bewray him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe of any hidden fault;</hi> because these points import no crimes of themselues, and (by common intendement) may bee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise sufficiently knowen.</p>
                     <p>Now if the <note n="1" place="margin">Specul. ibidem nu. 41. &amp; 42.</note> partie defendant shall denie vpon his <hi>oathe,</hi> all these aforesaid matters, whereof he is <hi>interrogated;</hi> &amp; none other sufficient detectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> besides, being against him, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> cannot the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie</hi> Iudge proceed; to giue him an oath touching the trueth of the very <hi>crime</hi> it selfe obiected: vntill hee shall haue made proofe by <hi>witnesses,</hi> that the <hi>partie</hi> is (in deede) thereof <hi>infamed,</hi> hath else-where <hi>confessed it,</hi> is <hi>conuicted</hi> thereof, or some such like. For when all of these, or any of them, is either <hi>prooued,</hi> or by the <hi>partie</hi> himselfe confessed <hi>iudiciallie:</hi> then may the <hi>Iudge</hi> lawfully giue vnto the partie defendant, an oath; touching the trueth of the very <hi>crime</hi> it selfe: to the <note n="2" place="margin">Io.

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Chapter, such obiections, as already are, and some which perhaps hereafter may bee made against this kind of oath from the <hi>Ciuill,</hi> or <hi>Canon</hi> lawes; come to be answered. Of these, most be made by the <hi>Treatisour,</hi> &amp;c. and some may hereafter be obiected (perhaps) by others. The <hi>Treatisours,</hi> be either against some circumstances about it; or else against the <hi>oath</hi> it selfe. But first, touching his by-matters, or circumstances.</p>
                     <p>Because the priuate Schedule (concerning these oaths) which was set downe by certaine <hi>Doctors,</hi> (as is mentioned <hi>in the epistle to the Reader)</hi> conteineth; that, the defendant in a cause <hi>crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi> is to answere other <hi>Articles,</hi> so they be not tending to the <hi>crime</hi> it selfe, though it be at the suite of <hi>a partie:</hi> hee saieth, that the <hi>Maxime,</hi> of <hi>nemo tenetur seipsum prodere, is (thereby) so weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as it will scarcely nowe serue for a Minime.</hi> For reason of this consequence; hee asketh, <hi>if this be not to goe like the crabbe, oblique, and to proceed the same way, although not to treade the
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:19125:223"/>
direct steppes?</hi> and asketh also, what should be meant by other <hi>articles,</hi> but such <hi>as concerne circumstances, and inducements to the crimes?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He is therefore to vnderstand, that at the suite of <hi>a partie,</hi> a man (by those lawes) is neither to answere <hi>criminous</hi> articles diducing <note n="1" place="margin">Angelus de maleficijs.</note> the very crime it selfe, nor yet such, as haue any neere coherence thereto, or be <hi>propinqui Actus ipsi maleficio.</hi> But of other matters hauing none affinitie with the very <hi>crime;</hi> as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be of that <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> and such like; the defendant is by vertue of his oath (euen at another mans suite) to answere: and therefore no such <hi>crooked</hi> measure is offered herein at all. But <hi>he seeth no reason</hi> (he saith) <hi>why there should be any difference betweene the suite, and instance of the partie, and the proceeding ex officio:</hi> in that, <hi>the reason</hi> alledged for to make a difference, <hi>is but this:</hi> Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancies enioyned by Ordinaries, are not taken in lawe for <hi>poenae,</hi> but <hi>medicina.</hi> If he see not this, why there should be any diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene those two proceedings; I maruaile then, what cause he can see, so highly else-where, to magnifie the course of proceeding by an <hi>Accusour,</hi> as very <hi>equall,</hi> and <hi>iust:</hi> but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne (simply) all proceeding <hi>of Office, as vniust, forreine, cruell, heathenish,</hi> and <hi>prophane,</hi> and I know not what.</p>
                     <p>That he may therefore <hi>see</hi> great cause of <hi>difference</hi> betwixt these two; let him a litle weigh with himselfe, what the reason (at the <hi>common law)</hi> should be; why an <hi>Appellee</hi> is allowed more freedome in sundry respects, then a man <hi>endited</hi> at the <hi>Q.</hi> suite <hi>ex officio</hi> simply? and why, he may then put it to <hi>tryall by battaile</hi> with the <hi>appellor;</hi> but cannot haue that <hi>tryall,</hi> vpon an <hi>Indite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</hi> And also, why a defendant, against whom an <hi>Information</hi> is preferred for some <hi>criminall</hi> matter in the Courtes of the <hi>Q. Bench, common pleas,</hi> or <hi>Exchequer</hi> (which neuerthelesse is by a kinde of proceeding <hi>mixt</hi> of both the kindes) shall not be vrged to answere, the <hi>bill,</hi> or any <hi>interrogatories</hi> vpon his oath, as all defendants in <hi>Criminall</hi> causes, be forced to doe in the <hi>Starchamber?</hi> He is also to be put in minde, that men vse not in such briefe schedules as that was; to alledge for euery matter, all the reasons they can: yet that one alledged, is of it selfe a <hi>reason</hi> sufficient, of such diuersitie. for is there as great reason, that I should vpon mine <hi>oath</hi> discouer my crimes, being no way
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:19125:224"/>
therof duely <hi>infamed,</hi> or they otherwise proued, for the satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on onely of mine aduersaries malicious humor by mine owne more grieuous punishment: as there is (when these or some like be precedent) that I should to mine <hi>Ordinary</hi> or <hi>Spirituall father;</hi> who in a farre milder course, for his duties sake, &amp; in <hi>charitie,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth my good, by reformation of me, &amp; amendment in me; and by remouing the <hi>scandal,</hi> which els might iustly be taken against me? And (by the <hi>Canon</hi> lawe) as is else-where touched, <hi>mitiùs agitur cum inquisito conuicto, quàm cum accusato conuicto.</hi> Seing then vpon <hi>conuiction</hi> by way of <hi>accusation,</hi> the very <hi>ordinarie</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naltie by law appointed, is (for the terrour of others) imposed without any mitigation: therfore the oath cannot so reasonably thereupon be exacted, as it may vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Iudges</hi> proceedings, by his <hi>meere office,</hi> vnto a farre other more milde end, for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most part.</p>
                     <p>But as if those <hi>Doctors</hi> had absolutely denyed <hi>penances,</hi> which be enioyned <hi>ex officio Iudicis,</hi> to be any <hi>punishments</hi> at al, because they are said to be <hi>medicinae:</hi> he asketh, <hi>whether penance, although it be but standing in a sheete, aswell as the standing on the Pillorie (in respect of publike shame grieuous and odious to all men) shall not bee accounted a punishment?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I answere, that neither the law, nor those <hi>Doctors</hi> in saying they be <hi>medicinae, non poenae,</hi> doe thereby deny <hi>absolutely</hi> (as he reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth) that they be <hi>punishments.</hi> For this saying of the lawe, is a <hi>Negatiue</hi> by <hi>comparison</hi> only; which the <hi>Treatisor</hi> either would not, or did not vnderstand, to be none <hi>absolute denial.</hi> and that <hi>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancies</hi> (in deed) be so, we may learne by <hi>S.</hi> 
                        <note n="1" place="margin">August. episto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la. 159. ad Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellum.</note> 
                        <hi>Augustine</hi> speaking hereof in this maner: <hi>quis non intelligit magis beneficium, quàm supplicium nuncupandum, vbi nec saeuiendi relaxatur audacia, nec poenitendi salutaris medicina subtrahitur?</hi> Standing on the <hi>Pillorie</hi> which (as I take it) by a word borrowed of the <hi>Graecians,</hi> may be termed <hi>catamidtatio;</hi> it was euen of ancient times, (aswell as at this day) accounted an <hi>infamous</hi> punishment vnto the <hi>partie,</hi> that endured it: and is allowed, for a good proofe of <hi>infamie</hi> by law. but he that hath done <hi>publike penance,</hi> is not (in lawe) to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted therfore <hi>infamous:</hi> but rather to be a man amended and reformed; and such, as at whose conuersion, the <hi>Angels in heauen doe reioyce.</hi> and therefore his companie is not afterward to be shunned or auoyded, by any discreete or moderate <hi>Christian;</hi> as if
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:19125:224"/>
he were still a man of steined credit, or conuersation. So that the great diuersitie of the endes, whereunto these be referred; doe make a very notable <hi>difference</hi> in the <hi>punishments</hi> themselues. For in the one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the delinquent is propounded for a publike spectacle of shame &amp; reproch, to be shunned of all men: the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by these outward tokens of <hi>humilitie</hi> &amp; <hi>submission,</hi> testifieth his inward sorow &amp; griefe for the sinne, and as it were thereby craueth (in pitie and compassion) to be receiued againe, into the <hi>Christian</hi> fellowship, as a man (by <hi>repentance)</hi> fully reconciled againe vnto God, and vnto his <hi>Church.</hi> Hitherto in answere of his obiections made against some <hi>by-circumstances</hi> of such oath.</p>
                     <p>Against the <hi>oath</hi> it selfe, the <hi>Treatisour</hi> bringeth some <hi>reasons,</hi> some <hi>allegations</hi> fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lawyers, &amp; some out of the lawes the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues. First he saith, there is no <hi>Iustice</hi> in the proceeding, at giuing such <hi>oath:</hi> because there be not three in Iudgement, viz. the <hi>plaintife,</hi> the <hi>defendant,</hi> and the <hi>Iudge;</hi> and thereunto alledgeth <hi>Bracton.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But what if the maner of proceeding <hi>ex officio</hi> were vniust, which in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> second part is shewed to be otherwise; can this proue the ministring of an <hi>oath</hi> to the defendant in a <hi>Criminall cause,</hi> to be vnlawfull? For first, proceeding <hi>ex officio</hi> may be, euen where the matter is <hi>Ciuill,</hi> or <hi>criminall,</hi> howbeit but <hi>Ciuilly</hi> moued, and there (for the most part) none oath is vsed. Secondly, it may be, when none <hi>oath</hi> touching any crime, is to be ministred to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant at all. Lastly, an <hi>oath</hi> in a cause <hi>criminall</hi> may sometimes be tendered, where the proceeding is not of <hi>office</hi> at all, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing all these three persons in iudgement, and that not by <hi>impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> or representatiuely only: but euen <hi>formally.</hi> and therefore (in all those respects) his argument doth not follow. yet for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther answere, I must also tell him, that in all due proceeding <hi>of office,</hi> there be <hi>three persons in iudgement.</hi> For (as hath bene said) that which openeth way to such <hi>Enquirie,</hi> doth represent, and standeth in stead of a <hi>Plaintife,</hi> for preferring vp of the matter.</p>
                     <p>Againe, that an expressed and <hi>formall plaintife</hi> to preferre vp matter <hi>criminall,</hi> is not alwayes required; is <note n="1" place="margin">Cap. 15. &amp; 16. 2. part.</note> manifoldly shewed, by often practises recorded in the word of God it selfe, to the contrary.</p>
                     <p>He concludeth also against <hi>generall oathes, and against extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting (by oath) of the ground and foundation of Inquisition from the
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:19125:225"/>
partie conuented:</hi> out of the saide little schedule of the <hi>Doctors.</hi> From which conclusion albeit not following of those pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses; we do not any way debarre him; seeing no such <hi>practise</hi> is either allowed, or (I thinke) in this Realme heard of. and therefore he wrongeth all <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> courts the more, who so often heapeth vp these vntrue and vnlikely imputations against them. An other of his allegations, is out of <note n="1" place="margin">Clar. in pract. Crim. q. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>Iulius Clarus;</hi> to prooue (forsooth) by <hi>Canons,</hi> and <hi>Canonists,</hi> this kinde of <hi>oath</hi> to be <hi>a prophane, and more then heathenish maner of Inquisition,</hi> (for such is the mildenesse of the mans spirit) and <hi>contrary (if he be not deceiued) to the rules and Canons of the Antichristian Church of Rome, which be more iust</hi> (he saith) <hi>or lesse vniust a great deale then such, as haue taken vpon them to iudge, by colour of the same.</hi> for <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedere</hi> (saith <hi>Clarus) ex officio mero, est quando Iudex a seipso, &amp; ex officio assumit informationes, contra deliquentem, &amp; contra eum pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedit</hi> &amp;c. wherupon, he gathereth, that <hi>to proceede by Inquisition, is not to make the partie by oath or examination to be his owne accuser; but to receiue information, and witnesses against him.</hi> This, which he thence collecteth, of not compelling the <hi>partie</hi> defendant by oath, to become his <hi>owne Accuser</hi> is true, if it be as truely vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, though it be not inferred truely from that allegation. for no man is by <hi>oath,</hi> so compelled: but rather by discouery of the whole trueth, to <hi>cleare</hi> himselfe of the <hi>crime</hi> after he be (as it were) <hi>accused,</hi> and brought into question by some of those <hi>lawfull</hi> meanes, which open a way vnto <hi>speciall Enquirie.</hi> Besides, this allegation maketh nothing for proofe of the vnlawfulnesse of such oath, after sufficient detection. For <hi>Clarus</hi> in this place, speaketh onely of the <hi>processe,</hi> or <hi>enquirie informatiue,</hi> grounded vpon some <hi>Clamosa insinuatio,</hi> or <hi>scandall;</hi> and not of any part of <hi>processe punitiue,</hi> which followeth vpon the former: at what time the oath of the partie, is to be taken. which thing, the same <hi>Authour,</hi> (thorowout his whole booke) most plainely sheweth: if it had pleased the <hi>Treatisour</hi> to haue perused but a little more of it. This therfore is a <hi>fallacie,</hi> of not disputing <hi>ad idem:</hi> besides, <note place="margin">Ignoratio Elenchi.</note> 
                        <hi>inciuile est, nisitotalege perspecta, iudicare.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The next of his <hi>allegations,</hi> is out of a meere <note n="2" place="margin">10. Petr. Ferrar. forma Inquisit. ver. forma pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lica.</note> 
                        <hi>Ciuilian</hi> writer and no <hi>Canonist,</hi> as he supposed: with whom he hath the same, and no better lucke, then he had afore with the other; for want
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:19125:225"/>
of knowledge to distinguish, betwixt <hi>Processe informatiue,</hi> and <hi>Punitiue:</hi> for thereof onely <hi>Petr. de Ferrarijs</hi> there speaketh, not once mentioning an oath: Albeit the <hi>Treatisour</hi> doe ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both that and other things also thereof, which bee not there conteyned; which I will not nowe <hi>trauerse</hi> with him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they tende not to our principall purpose.</p>
                     <p>Out of the lawe it selfe, hee taketh holde of that <hi>Rule,</hi> which the sayde <hi>Doctors</hi> did alledge, viz. <hi>nemo tenetur seipsum prodere.</hi> but that <hi>proditus per famam &amp;c. tenetur seipsum osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere &amp; purgare,</hi> &amp;c. (which they did also adioyne) he cannot in any sorte brooke, or digest, <hi>as a glosse,</hi> (he sayeth) <hi>confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the text.</hi> yet is it not any <hi>glosse,</hi> but aswell warranted by lawe; as the <hi>rule</hi> it selfe. neither doth it <hi>confound,</hi> but shewe, howe that <hi>rule</hi> is (truely) to bee vnderstoode: so that one part of the lawe (without any <hi>antinomie)</hi> may stand with another. This himselfe might haue remembred to bee lawe, euen by occasion of his owne allegation else-where, viz. that <hi>such as refuse to sweare or answere vnto Articles, are by the Ecclesiasticall lawe, to bee holden pro confessis.</hi> If then that lawe doe so deepely punish the contemptuous in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halfe; as to <hi>conuict</hi> them therefore, of the very crime im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted: may wee not gather, that the lawes <hi>Ciuill</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> require men to answere euen matters <hi>Criminall,</hi> vpon their oathes?</p>
                     <p>But if the <hi>Canon</hi> lawe-shall bee by others alledged, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouch such oath, as we heere treate of: to this <hi>allegation</hi> in seuerall places the <hi>Treatisour</hi> maketh these seuerall answeres following. First, hee sayeth, that such oath is <hi>against Gods word,</hi> and therefore <hi>no binding lawe:</hi> for which consequence, hee alledgeth <hi>Saint Germaine, in his booke of Doctor and Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient.</hi> Secondly, that the two statutes of <hi>Submission of the Clergie,</hi> made in king Henrie the eight his time (still <note n="1" place="margin">25. H. 8. 27. H. 8.</note> conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing in force) doe take away the <hi>Canon</hi> lawe. Thirdly, that this kinde of <hi>oath</hi> is contrary to the lawes of the <hi>Realme.</hi> All which asseuerations are nothing else, but begging of that, which is the principall controuersie.</p>
                     <p>Touching the first of these, it commeth in the next Chapter to bee disoussed; whether, ministring of such oath,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:19125:226"/>
be against <hi>Gods word,</hi> or no. For the second, those two sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes are so farre, from taking the <hi>Canon lawe</hi> away, that both of them doe (in trueth) establish, all <hi>Canons</hi> being of that qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie, as is there expressed; vnto all which wee auerre, this <hi>oath</hi> to bee consonant. The <hi>Clergie</hi> (in deede) doe there promise, not to <hi>enact or put in vre, any newe Canons, &amp;c. without the kings expresse assent:</hi> of which sorte, this oath is none; for it hath beene prooued by farre elder <hi>Canons,</hi> then that time.

                        <hi>agree to the Preamble</hi> of the statute, establishing <hi>dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> A man woulde thinke, if any part of <hi>Canon</hi> lawe should swarue from those conditions required to make them <hi>English lawes:</hi> that <hi>dispensations,</hi> (which of all other are most <hi>strict,</hi> and neuer afore that time spedde in this Realme) shoulde bee holden for <hi>forren lawes,</hi> rather then this kinde of <hi>oath,</hi> so vsuall afore and since in most courtes. yet these <hi>dispensations</hi> are also there approoued for <hi>English lawes.</hi> Let him therefore <hi>vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand;</hi> that, all those things there required (viz. <hi>sufferance, consent,</hi> and <hi>custome:)</hi> to make the <hi>Canons</hi> establishing such <hi>oathes</hi> to be accounted the <hi>customed, and ancient lawes of this Realme, originally established as lawes of the same;</hi> doe in these oathes so aptly concurre (as hath beene prooued) that none of his confident denials thereof, can or shall bee able any more, to empeach them from so being: then the burning of the <hi>Canon</hi> lawe at <hi>Wittenberge</hi> by <hi>Luther</hi> (when the <hi>Pope</hi> had burnt his bookes at <hi>Rome)</hi> either did, was meant, or yet coulde abrogate the continuall vse of a great part thereof in <hi>Germanie,</hi> euen vntill this day; or then it coulde, or ought to haue any force to disanull it here in <hi>England.</hi> for the statute establishing such <hi>Canons</hi> as there bee mentioned, was made
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:19125:226"/>
in the selfe same <hi>Parliament</hi> and <hi>Session</hi> thereof; that this <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble</hi> was before the statute of <hi>Dispensations,</hi> whereby hee woulde nowe ouerthrowe the <hi>Canon</hi> lawe wholly. And both of those statutes, at the beginning of her <hi>Maiesties</hi> reigne, were reuiued againe in one Act. Howe can there then bee any such <hi>contrarietie,</hi> or <hi>abrogation generall</hi> of the <hi>Canon</hi> lawe, as this man dreameth of: except all that were present in those two <hi>Parliaments,</hi> had bene fast on sleepe, when they twise passed them both together for <hi>statutes?</hi>

                        <hi>Plutarch</hi> doth set downe three reasons: first, that <hi>an oath is a kinde of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to a free man: Secondly, for that it is absurd in smaller causes not to credite their wordes; who for the highest matters touching God, are credited, and put in trust. Thirdly, for that an oath draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after it, an imprecation or curse, in case hee shoulde be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sworne: which seemeth to be a detestable omination, towards the Priests of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, then wee see hereby, in so much as this was a <hi>peculiar priuiledge</hi> graunted to these: that therefore all others might (by <hi>Magistrates)</hi> be put to their <hi>oathes.</hi> And secondly, that it was from all <hi>swearing absolutely;</hi> and not in matters <hi>criminall</hi> onely, which is our present controuersie.</p>

                     <p>And therefore they holde; that, they are by <hi>Gods lawe</hi> bound, not to answere (in that sort) vpon their oath: which is more then if they had onely sayd; that they are not bound, and so left at libertie, either to answere, or not, as themselues should thinke good. whereby they would leaue a dangerous impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in the peoples mindes; that such lawes of this land (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are borne subiects, and by which they are to be gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) may not be obeyed <hi>of Gods people,</hi> with a safe conscience; as being contrary to the word of <hi>God.</hi> A matter assuredly of most perillous consequence, to leaue vnto the onely scanning and finall determination of euery priuate subiect; how farre he neede to obey the <hi>positiue lawes</hi> of his countrey.

                     </p>
                     <p>For mine owne part, I haue alwayes taken it to be a <note n="3" place="margin">T.

For if this were a true <hi>posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> then a man might beleeue no historie to be true, which is not in the <hi>Bible;</hi> no <hi>Maximes,</hi> or grounds of any sciences, nor common principles, left knowen vnto vs by the light of nature (as that <hi>two and two make foure)</hi> nor that there is any such coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey as <hi>America, &amp;c.</hi> neither might a man (with safe conscience) doe infinite many things permitted by humane lawes, and sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry of them also commaunded to be done: because all these <hi>hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stories</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> and the most of these <hi>lawes</hi> be such; as can neuer (by any sound reason) be positiuely, immediately, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly prooued out of <hi>Scripture:</hi> but onely by this generalitie, that therefore they may be beleeued, or done; because they are not contrary to <hi>Scripture,</hi> are agreeable to the vncorrupted light of <hi>nature,</hi> or to sundry credible mens <hi>experience,</hi> or are by the <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique lawes</hi> of our countrey, receiued.</p>
                     <p>For who can giue any other sound reason directly drawen from the <hi>Scripture;</hi> that <hi>theft</hi> shall be punished with death: that matters of fact shall bee tried by a <hi>Iurie of twelue,</hi> led sometimes not by <hi>witnesses,</hi> but by circumstances and probable induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: that the eldest sonne shall haue all his fathers land (by descent) from the rest of his brethren, though they bee neuer so many; who no lesse then the eldest are descending from him: that my kinsman remooued (perhaps fiue or sixe degrees) descending of the whole bloud from my <hi>fathers brother,</hi> shall,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:19125:228"/>
and lawfully may inherite my lande, before mine owne fathers sonne by another wife: that at one and twentie yeeres, a man may effectually sell his lande, but not the day before, albeit hee haue receiued my money: that <hi>the wrecke of the sea,</hi> albeit the owner of the goods bee certainely knowen, shall bee confisca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and belong to the <hi>Prince:</hi> that a <hi>straie</hi> proclaimed (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to lawe) after a yeere and a day, shall belong to the lord of the Mannour, where it was taken vp: with infinite such like?</p>
                     <p>Therefore, it is no good, nor safe ground, that the <hi>Innoua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours</hi> doe stand vpon: when as (being pressed to take such <hi>oath</hi> according to the lawes of the Realme) they alleage; that in conscience they may not doe it, because they finde no direct warrant for it by <hi>Scripture,</hi> whereupon to staie their conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. For if it were graunted vnto them, that there bee no <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements,</hi> no <hi>examples,</hi> no footesteppes or traces thereof in <hi>Scriptures:</hi> yet if it be not by them prohibited, or condemned, the generall obedience of subiects will tie them thereunto.</p>
                     <p>But I purpose also (here) to shew, the lawfulnesse of it, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen positiuely out of the worde of God. First, declaring that <hi>Magistrates</hi> may laie oathes vpon their Subiectes, which are necessarilie by them to be taken: Then that they may be tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and taken in causes <hi>criminall</hi> and <hi>penall</hi> to the parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: and lastly, I minde in the next chapter (God willing) to answere the obiections, that I finde brought to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie.</p>
                     <p>That when an oathe is duely imposed, there is a necessitie enioyned the subiect to take it; doeth appeare by the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of <hi>God</hi> himselfe: <hi>Thoushalt feare the Lord thy God, and serue him, and shalt sweare by his name.</hi> which words being <hi>disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,</hi> not onely to the maner of the oath, <hi>viz. by Godsname;</hi> but also to the action it selfe offwearing: doth argue euidently, that there be oaths, as well <hi>necessarie,</hi> as there be <hi>voluntarie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The like commandement is giuen by the Lord in the prophet <note n="1" place="margin">Iere. 4. v. 2.</note>

                        <hi>hee made them sweare.</hi> By which wee may gather; that if any of them would not haue sworne vpon his commaundement; they should haue bene compelled thereunto, by some <hi>Ciuill</hi> constraint.</p>

                        <hi>Nehemias caused the Priests to sweare, to restore these againe, and to forgiue the hundreth part of the very principall, due vnto them.</hi> So by the premisses, we see; that <hi>Magistrates</hi> may exact <hi>oaths</hi> of those that be vnder them, which ought not to be refused.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Treatisour</hi> himselfe will not bee straite with vs in this poynt. for hee yeeldeth that the <hi>Magistrate</hi> may <hi>impose oaths,</hi> so these conditions following, be obserued, <hi>videlicet,</hi> that <hi>either
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:19125:230"/>
the glorie of God bee thereby maintained, or the good of the Common wealth, or of our neighbours furthered:</hi> also that <hi>it bee not in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of trifles:</hi> which though it be true, yet he prooueth it, euen triflingly: <hi>because</hi> (saieth hee) <hi>de minimis non curat lex.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that <hi>it bee not ouer frequent:</hi> that, <hi>it bee not touching matters impossible or beyond a mans power:</hi> that <hi>the Deponent bee not cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumuented with captious questions;</hi> and that <hi>it bee not giuen to men of suspected faith, or credite.</hi> which last, is neither by any <hi>lawe,</hi> nor <hi>Diuinitie</hi> (that I know of) required: except he thus vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it; that an oathe is not to bee ministred vnto any who is probably suspected to bee likelie, to forsweare himselfe. For a man may be <hi>suspected,</hi> yea and <hi>diffamed</hi> also for <hi>conuersation of life,</hi> and yet without iust cause: yea, and though there bee cause of the <hi>fame</hi> and suspicion; yet is it not (in charitie) to be presumed that euery one, who (through frailtie) hath offended; will therefore forsweare himselfe, when he shall bee put to an oathe.</p>
                     <p>These afore recited, bee his proofes, and all his premisses (taken from <hi>Diuinitie,)</hi> whereupon he buildeth his <hi>frequent</hi> and <hi>vehement conclusions</hi> agaynst the oathe which we speake of, to make it contrary vnto Gods worde. which <hi>premisses</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion,</hi> I beleeue, can neuer bee truely drawen together, into a good consequence; by any strength of mans wit, or by arte of reasoning.

                     <p>The next poynt to be handled, is, that <hi>oathes</hi> may lawfullie be taken, euen in matters <hi>criminall</hi> and penall to him, that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them.</p>
                     <p>If an oathe must be kept, though it be to a mans owne hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance and damage, then may it also be taken. For that which we neede not keepe, and may lawfully breake, was vnlawfull at first, to be taken. But sundrie <hi>oathes</hi> made, though happilie tending to our owne hinderance, must be kept; for so it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded indefinitely, and indistinctly, by God. And it is <note n="1" place="margin">Num. 30. v. 3.

How much more then, must it be kept, beyng commaunded by a <hi>Magistrate;</hi> then when it is made to a priuate person onely? and being by vertue of his obedience imposed, then when it is only <hi>voluntarily</hi> taken? And therefore being to be kept, may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so (lawfully) be taken.</p>

                     <p>There seemeth to me a very direct and playne place in the <hi>Prouerbs</hi> of <hi>Salomon;</hi> for proofe, that an <hi>adiuration</hi> &amp; <hi>curse</hi> made but indefinitely, &amp; generally against any who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>soeuer, that had co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                        <hi>that is partener with a thiefe</hi> (saith Salomon) <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his owne soule; he heareth cursing, and declareth it not. To be partner with a thiefe, is</hi> (no doubt) <hi>a filthie crime.</hi> and such a man cannot be aptly sayde, to <hi>hate his owne soule,</hi> vnlesse the fault it selfe were a grieuous sinne. The reason, why such one is noted by the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> so grieuously to sinne, as that he is thereby ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted an enemie to his <hi>owne soule,</hi> is; because he <hi>heareth cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,</hi> and <hi>reuealeth not the theft,</hi> wherein he is <hi>partaker.</hi> It resteth then onely to knowe, what <hi>that cursing</hi> is, which in this place is meant. The <hi>Hebrewe</hi> interpreters (as I haue learned of those, who bee very skilfull, and conuersant in them) doe expound it of <hi>that curse with adiuration;</hi> which the <hi>Priestes</hi> vsually gaue against any, whosoeuer had done or knowen of some cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine offence, which was committed; if they would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale, who were the offendors. whereupon doth followe, that euen the <hi>partner with a thiefe,</hi> vpon such a generall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite <hi>curse;</hi> was bounde in conscience, to reueale the theft; though it touched, both anothers, and also his owne <hi>shame,</hi> and <hi>dishonestie:</hi> and albeit hee was not called into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, nor (perhaps) had in any suspition thereof. Then how much more, when <hi>Gods Priest,</hi> or the Iudge (who is <hi>Gods Lieutenant)</hi> vpon probable groundes and inducements a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore discouered to him, doth charge a singular person with such a crime, is hee bounde before God, to reueile the whole trueth?</p>
                     <p>This kinde of <hi>Adiuration with curse,</hi> to the intent to haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed, by whom goods were stollen; was also in vse, amongs priuate persons in the people of God: and they had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science (being but charged indefinitely amongs others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any discouerie or cause of suspition against any of them in particular) not to conceale the theft: as <note n="2" place="margin">Iudic. 17. ver. 1. 2, 3.</note> appeareth, by the historie of <hi>Michah,</hi> and his mother. for that which the <hi>latin interpreter</hi> there, readeth thus: <hi>quos separaueras: Arias</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Whereby, is also argued <hi>a fortiori,</hi> that whereas by <hi>fame,</hi> or other good <hi>presumptions</hi> and <hi>euidence;</hi> a man is detected of crimes most <hi>secret</hi> afore: there the <hi>Magistrate</hi> may exact the parties owne <hi>confession:</hi> especially if it be not so penall, as either <hi>life</hi> or <hi>limme,</hi> which this of <hi>Achan,</hi> was. Next may bee gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that to confesse vnto a <hi>Magistrate</hi> duely charging a man, is to confesse vnto God: thirdly, that to make such <hi>confession</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> is to <hi>glorifie him:</hi> And lastly, that in like cases, the partie is bound to disclose the particular circumstances, though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he be not seuerally and in particular interrogated of euery one: for it is there sayd, <hi>shew me now what thou hast done.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon <hi>Achan</hi> being touched in conscience, &amp; knowing his duetie to the <hi>Magistrate;</hi> confessed his fault, with all the particularities thereof. If this were done vpon his oath (as many learned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters do hold) then may an oath be vrged in a matter <hi>crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi> and most penall to the partie. If he thus confessed, and was bound so to doe, though it were without <hi>oath:</hi> then howe much more, when the partie is tied by an <hi>oath,</hi> giuen by the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> as it is prooued, it may be lawfully.</p>
                     <p>And albeit the <hi>Treatisour</hi> himselfe confesse the effect of that which we haue gathered touching this <hi>Historie:</hi> yet he saith, <hi>the Magistrates charge vnto him; that (remembring the glorie of God) he should confesse the trueth: is none oath.

                        <hi>Angustine</hi> expoundeth it of this case, viz. where a man heareth another sweare, and depose falsely. <hi>For</hi> (saith he) <hi>this, that place seemeth to saye, that a man sinneth, who heareth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther sweare something, that he knowes to be false, if he hold his peace. But he is then said to knowe, either when he is a witnesse of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter deposed of, or did see it, or was priuie to it, that is, did by any meanes knowe it, as either by seeing it, or by hearing him speake of it, that now sweareth otherwise.</hi> So that he leaueth it at large, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to <hi>Oathes</hi> (falsely) taken, either before a <hi>Magistrate;</hi> or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately, or how else soeuer.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iunius</hi> in his second edition of <hi>Annotations</hi> vpon this chapter, restraineth it onely vnto such vaine, and rashe oathes, as men sweare <hi>extraiudicially:</hi> making him that heareth another to sweare (without reprehending him) to be guilrie of sinne him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, as no doubt he is. But surely this interpretation of his, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be grounded vpon this place: at least the place cannot (by any meanes) be onely restrained vnto this case. For the <hi>matter</hi> concerning which a man <hi>heareth</hi> another sweare, is the thing (here) principally considerable; and not the very <hi>Oathe</hi> it selfe: because it is not onely said: <hi>If a man heare the voyce of an oathe:</hi> but it is also added (as most materiall) <hi>&amp; ipse testis vidit, &amp; sciuit, which matter he, as a witnesse hath seene, or otherwise, by some meanes hath knowledge of; if he shall not declare it, or reueale it, he shall beare his owne iniquitie and sinne.</hi> Therefore it is the <hi>matter</hi> which the by-stander is able to witnesse of (by reason of his <hi>sight,</hi> or some other meanes of <hi>knowing</hi> it) that (for the auoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of sinne) must be declared.</p>
                     <p>Againe, if it were onely meant of him, that heareth another <hi>blaspheme,</hi> or <hi>vainely,</hi> and <hi>falsely, sweare,</hi> and doeth not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and rebuke him for it: then could not the verbe of <hi>Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring</hi> haue bene vsed, but rather some worde of rebuke, or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension.
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:19125:235"/>
Thirdly, if it were meant onely of the <hi>Act of swearing</hi> that is not rebuked; then needed no mention to haue bene made, of any other <hi>sense,</hi> but of <hi>hearing</hi> onely. But we see, that there is mentioned <hi>seeing;</hi> and also (with a <hi>disiunctiue)</hi> any other meanes of <hi>knowing</hi> it, besides hearing of the oath: and therefore, that meaning which <hi>Iunius</hi> giueth thereof, cannot (possibly) be the very true sense of this place. Nay <hi>Iunius</hi> himselfe in his first <hi>Annotations,</hi> confesseth the most to holde, that it ought to be vnderstood thus: viz. that he sinneth, who heareth an <hi>oath</hi> giuen to another man touching any matter, whereof he hath know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; if hee doe not therein disclose what he knoweth. So that whether the other depose <hi>vainely, falsely,</hi> or not, is not here spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, or to be attended: but whether a man conceale his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a matter in question, that is conuenient to be knowen vnto a <hi>Iudge.</hi> for it is he, that hath authoritie to vse the <hi>voyce of an oath,</hi> or of that <hi>adiuration</hi> or charge vnto another, which is here spoken of.</p>
                     <p>By this sense hereof, giuen by the most, and flowing easily from the very wordes themselues, may be gathered; that an oath may be giuen to the partie enquired of <hi>indefinitely,</hi> as the <hi>Iudge</hi> (according to lawe) shall thinke good to proceede, euen before any witnesses bee produced against the partie: that this voyce of an <hi>oath</hi> and charge to sweare, may be giuen; before it be knowen whether any, or what witnesses can testifie therein: and that a man knowing the trueth touching a matter whereof another is <hi>enquired</hi> of by <hi>oath,</hi> ought (for auoyding of sinne) to testifie, and to <hi>declare</hi> his knowledge therein.</p>
                     <p>Yet because in that place, no mention is (expressely) made, of any other person but of him, that <hi>heareth such oath,</hi> who also <hi>hath seene</hi> or <hi>knowen</hi> something, and who is to <hi>declare and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueale it,</hi> or else to <hi>beare his owne sinne:</hi> therefore it is also (very probably) by some taken to haue place, when a mans owne selfe is <hi>adiured</hi> or charged by the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> to take oath. For the person of the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> or some other must needes be vnderstoode besides, though none be expressed; because it is sayde: <hi>If a man haue heard the voyce of an oath,</hi> whereby some other person, then the hearer himselfe, is necessarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied. For albeit the <hi>Hebrew</hi> interpreters do vnderstand it of that
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:19125:235"/>
                        <hi>adiuration</hi> with <hi>curse,</hi> which was done by the <hi>Priest:</hi> whereby he (vsually) cursed any whosoeuer had committed some particular apparant crime, though the person were vnknowen &amp; vnsuspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, if they would not reueale it, according to the place afore alledged, out of the 29. Chapter of the <hi>Prouerbs:</hi> yet the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee Paraphraste,</hi> that writ in, or before <hi>Christs</hi> time, and of all Interpreters is of highest and most vncontrolled authoritie, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandeth it of the <hi>Iudge,</hi> and reades it thus, viz. <hi>the voyce of Adiuration or Execration</hi> made by the <hi>Iudge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And then out of both these Interpretations doth follow: that (without sinne) a man cannot but <hi>testific,</hi> both against another <hi>enquired</hi> of; for it is said, <hi>whether he haue seene:</hi> &amp; also against <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe</hi> (if it be required) for it is said, <hi>or haue knowen of it.</hi> which may as properly be referred to a mans own fact, as to any other mans: &amp; the rather to his owne; because, a man is least ignorant of his owne facts. And vpon this latter acception of the place, it doth follow; that a <hi>Iudge,</hi> and <hi>Magistrate</hi> may lawfully tender &amp; vrge such <hi>oathe,</hi> and a subiect ought not to refuse it: because <hi>hee shall beare his owne sinne,</hi> for <hi>hearing the voice of an oath giuen,</hi> and for <hi>not reuealing his knowledge</hi> in that matter.</p>
                     <p>When a man doth deliuer money or stuffe, of trust, <note n="1" place="margin">Exod. 22. <abbr>V.</abbr> 7. &amp; 8.</note>

                     </p>

that vpon the <hi>mutuall suspition</hi> onely, of the one against the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, both the <hi>parties</hi> are to take such oathe, which, though it doe tende to the discouerie of a mans owne <hi>shame, dishonestie, fraude</hi> and <hi>dammage</hi> (if hee happen to bee guiltie) yet is hee of necessitie to take it, or else to bee holden <hi>pro confesso &amp; conuicto;</hi> and is so well allowed also to bee giuen by the Iudges, and to be taken by the <hi>parties;</hi> that it is there called, <hi>an oath of the Lord.</hi>

For the slender remnants of honest, and vnho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, left euen to the very reprobate, euer since the fall of our first parent, doth remooue this action (euen where it may be lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly committed) from the sight, and knowledge of others, so much as may be.</p>
                     <p>And in this <note n="1" place="margin">Ibid. <abbr>V.</abbr> 13.</note> place, it is hidden and secret <hi>exipsa hypothesi:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the case is put, that there <hi>neither bee witnes, nor shee taken with the manner,</hi> and yet the husband hath her in <hi>iealousie.</hi> So that if God (in his diuine wisedome) found it equall and iust, for satisfaction onely of the strange humour of <hi>iealousie,</hi> not onelie (vpon paine of <hi>conuiction)</hi> to make her vndertake so perillous a kind of <hi>purgation,</hi> but also to charge her by an <hi>oathe,</hi> and a most solemne <hi>curse,</hi> to declare the trueth in a <hi>crime</hi> of this quality, and consequence to her life: howe can the wisedome of those, that chalenge <hi>oaths</hi> of farre more apparant mildenes in diuers points noted, stand so opposite to the wisedome of an whole Realme for many ages together: and being so strongly warranted by the wisedome of God, both in this, and the <hi>former Iudicialles,</hi> seruing for the gouernance of his owne <hi>peculiar</hi> people?</p>
                     <p>In answere of this example out of Gods lawe, the <hi>Treatisour</hi> saieth, that <hi>the woman is not heere called for ex officio: but vpon the complaint of her husband.</hi> But if it be conuenient and equall, vpon that most slender ground of <hi>iealousie,</hi> and vpon the husbandes <hi>suspicious denunciation,</hi> who perhappes is weary of his wife, and

mindeth to put her away, if his iealous humor in that behalfe, be not satisfied: how much more then is it equall and iust vpon the Iudges <hi>office</hi> to be done, who is no way priuatly interessed, &amp; for the satisfaction or preseruation of the <hi>church,</hi> or common weale, to remoue a common scandall and offence, by the parties clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or by his punishment? The consequence of this mine ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to be good, for proofe of a farre greater equitie, in the one then in the other, viz. rather to minister such oathe <hi>of office,</hi> then vpon an <hi>Accusers complaint,</hi> the lawes, both <hi>Ciuil</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> and the customes of all nations abroade, doe warrant vnto vs. all which, doe permit an <hi>oathe</hi> touching a <hi>crime,</hi> to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred vnto the defendant <hi>ex officio Iudicis,</hi> and yet they all doe denie it vpon an <hi>accusation,</hi> or vpon a complaint made by a voluntarie and priuate partie. And therefore this difference by him taken is such, as maketh flat against him: without working of anie diuersitie, to inferre an equitie in the one, and an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iustice in the other, as is pretended. therefore vntruely, and vainely doeth hee surmise, that out of this example we wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that <hi>euery Iudge Ecclesiasticall, to satisfie his iealous suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any crime, may appose by oathe, and compell men to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation:</hi> a matter repugnant vnto reason, vnto lawe, and vnto all practise.

                        <note n="1" place="margin">Ierem. 38. vers. 14, 15.</note> was charged by the <hi>King</hi> in a <hi>generalitie,</hi> to answere that which hee woulde aske him; hee stoode not vpon refusall, till hee might knowe what it was, but made this doubt onely, whether if hee tolde trueth, the <hi>King</hi> woulde not kill him. which when the <hi>King</hi> had promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed hee woulde not, then <hi>Ieremy</hi> condescended to answere what hee woulde demaunde of him. signifying thereby to vs, that being asked by a <hi>Magistrate,</hi> if it were not a matter <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall</hi> vnto him, hee ought, and woulde discouer it. If this were done vpon an <hi>oathe,</hi> then must wee doe the like, in the like case also. If hee did yeelde to answere vnto <hi>Interrogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> vncertaine, and vnknowen vnto him both in generalitie, and also in particularitie, and yet thought himselfe bounde to saie the trueth without oath: then much the rather would hee haue done it vnto those, whereof the qualitie he should haue knowen afore hand; but especially vpon his oath. And so ought wee, being so deepely charged. Yet these questions so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to be propounded vnto him, might haue beene of matters, both <hi>criminall</hi> and very <hi>penall</hi> vnto himselfe, and vnto others also.</p>
                     <p>When the same <note n="2" place="margin">Ierem. 37. vers. 13. &amp; 14.</note> Prophet was charged, with <hi>a particular crime,</hi> of intended defection and fleeing to the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> by <hi>Irijah a chiefe officer,</hi> sitting Iudicially <hi>in the gate of Beniamin:</hi> hee did not refuse directly to answere, by putting him off to prooue it by <hi>witnesses,</hi> or by anie such like <hi>dilatorie:</hi> but an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swereth roundely, and truely, in the very <hi>contradictorie</hi> (as it were ioyning issue with him) and sayeth: <hi>That is false, I flee not to the Chaldeans.</hi> Nowe, if the <hi>Prophet</hi> had beene guiltie, woulde hee haue falsely denied it, or haue made anie shiftes to auoyde it, thinke yee? or woulde hee say vntruely, being vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sworne, more then being sworne? I thinke no man will so ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine of the <hi>holie Prophet.</hi> and therefore (by this example) a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate</hi> in authoritie or a superiour, must bee directly dealt with, in questions pertinent, that he shall aske; whether vpon <hi>oathe,</hi> or without <hi>oathe;</hi> so farre as godlie Lawes doe require, albeit the matter be <hi>criminall,</hi> (as it was in this case) vnto the partie <hi>Interrogated.</hi>

If heere it bee saide, that he ministred none oathe vnto him, it is true: yet was it no more lawfull for <hi>Gehazi</hi> being his seruant, and vnder his authoritie, to deny it by falsehoode, (as hee did) or to haue answered not directly, or else nothing at all; then it would haue bene for him, to haue slatly forsworne it.

                     <p>In the proceeding <note n="3" place="margin">Act. 6. vers. 11.</note> against <hi>Saint Stephen,</hi> there were (in trueth) none <hi>Accusers,</hi> but those, who (by <hi>subornation) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced</hi> him to the <hi>Priestes,</hi> and who are twise <note n="4" place="margin">Ibid. <abbr>V.</abbr> 13. &amp; ca. 7. vers. 58.</note> called <hi>witnesses,</hi> because they deposed against him. yet when the <hi>high Priest</hi> as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him <note n="5" place="margin">Act. ca. 7. vers. 1. &amp;c.</note> thus: <hi>Are these things so?

other some of the crimes, by his <hi>aduersaries,</hi> and <hi>accusers</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to him. But if hee had learned the readie way that is nowe deuised, not onely to answere <hi>accusers</hi> obiections, but the <hi>Magistrates</hi> owne questions: hee might haue wiped them off quickely (without such long <hi>Apologies)</hi> and haue wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them onely to prooue what they sayde: yet neither (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressely) affirming, nor denying any thing.

                     <p>It is therefore well <note n="1" place="margin">Chromatius in 5. Matth. facit. can. 36. concil.

                     <p>This sort of <hi>oath</hi> was not only thus allowed in the old church: but commanded to be put in vre (as lawfull and consonant vnto Gods word) against persons conuented, and had in suspition for some offence, euen by the <hi>discipline</hi> of one <hi>Church;</hi> which the most, and hottest oppugners of this oathe, do reckon to be best, yea, and (almost) to be the onely <hi>reformation,</hi> that may right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be so called. For in the <hi>discipline of France</hi> concluded of in the <hi>Nationall Synodes</hi> there, holden in the yeeres 1559. 61. 63. and 65. it was <note n="1" place="margin">Tit. Eccles. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate or Consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie art. 12.</note> thus decreed: <hi>the faithfull may be constrained by the consistorie to tell the trueth; so farre foorth as it derogateth nothing, from the authoritie of the Magistrate. They may be constrained,</hi> sayeth that <hi>discipline:</hi> but there is no <hi>compulsion</hi> but either <hi>Ciuill,</hi> which they will not arrogate to themselues, as <hi>torture,</hi> or rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>imprisoning, fining, &amp;c.</hi> or else by the parties <hi>oathe,</hi> which vpon paine of periurie, if he once sweare, or vpon paine of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiction, if hee will not; doth, as it were, constraine a man to say trueth.</p>
                     <p>And that an oathe is meant (indeede) by this <hi>Canon,</hi> of the <hi>French Churches;</hi> wee are taught both by the historie of <hi>Campe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell</hi> a Minister of <hi>Geneua:</hi> and also by that, of those who daunced in one widow <hi>Balthasars</hi> house, there. For by this Cities exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and modell, the <hi>French discipline,</hi> was (almost wholy) plotted.

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter so many, and (to mine vnderstanding) plaine proofes made out of the worde of God, with some testimonies of the practise, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of this oathe in the <hi>Primitiue</hi> Church: it may be maruailed (perhaps) that any thing (as from <hi>Diuinitie)</hi> should to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> contrary be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. Neuerthelesse, besides foure discrepant opinions, one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> varying from another, &amp; holden by the <hi>Innouators</hi> about this matter, howbeit, eche of them tending either to the abrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, or els to the whole condemnation of this oathe; (which foure come to be discussed in the next Chapter) there be also sundrie other obiections made against it, which are here to bee considered. Whereof some are pretended to be gathered out of the word of God; and some are taken from <hi>Diuines.</hi> And of these later sort, sundrie are by waye of <hi>Allegation</hi> out of their
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:19125:241"/>
writings; and some others are brought from their <hi>Examples.</hi> Of those reasons that are pretended to be drawen from the <hi>word of God,</hi> I place that of the <hi>Treatisour</hi> in the first place, as most ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; wherehe sayeth; that by <hi>this oathe Gods sacredinstitution is greatly peruerted, and forced to another ende and purpose, then he in his diuine wisedome hath appointed.</hi> And the <hi>Note-gatherer</hi> sayth, <hi>it is contrary to Gods word.</hi> But why, and how it should be found contrarie to Gods institution in his worde, otherwise then is in part afore shewed, <hi>in mine Epistle to the Reader,</hi> and in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this <hi>Apologie,</hi> as occasion hath bene offered; they bring no proofe at all. And yet without any better vnderpropping, the <hi>Treatisour</hi> affirmeth this; euen for proofe of another point; viz. that <hi>by this oathe, no due honour can be giuen to God, but that he is thereby rather dishonoured.</hi> In deede if it were contrarie to <hi>Gods institution;</hi> then, no doubt, God is thereby <hi>dishonoured.</hi> For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing laid downe, that the true <hi>vse</hi> and <hi>ende</hi> of an <hi>oathe</hi> is, <hi>that due honor may be giuen vnto God, the trueth confirmed, Iustice main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined, Innocencie protected, and an ende had of strife, and controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie:</hi> he thereupon auoucheth his said former assertion.</p>
                     <p>It seemeth to me, that all these <hi>endes</hi> cannot concurre, and meete in euery <hi>oathe,</hi> though otherwise it will be yeelded most lawfull. For in case the partie himselfe, by an <hi>Assertorie</hi> oathe doe vntruely sweare (being guiltie of some crime or offence) or whether witnesses shall truely sweare touching the said <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> guiltines: it is most cleare, that (by such oathes) none <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie is protected,</hi> but <hi>nocencie</hi> either more heaped vp vpon the <hi>partie</hi> himselfe; or else discouered by the witnesses. Besides, when <hi>Abrahams</hi> seruant sware to him, that hee would not take a wife for his sonne, from amongst the Infidels of other nations: Or when a man sweareth <hi>allegeance, homage,</hi> or <hi>feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:</hi> or faithfull seruice and obedience to his <hi>generall,</hi> or taketh oathe of her <hi>Maiesties supremacie,</hi> and such like: what <hi>strife and controuersie (I pray) do these make any end of?</hi> Yea, or what <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie</hi> is thereby <hi>protected?</hi> seeing these oathes bee rather for reteyning the partie in his <hi>Innocencie,</hi> if hee stand (afore) well affected: or else doe serue, for discouerie o his hollow, and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous heart; in case hee shall make refufall of them. But let vs see how he prooueth; that the oathe which wee treate
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:19125:242"/>
of, answereth not vnto the other endes, which are by himselfe propounded. <hi>The trueth in controuersie</hi> (he sayth) <hi>is not thereby confirmed, since there is none issue ioyned in this case, betweene par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties affirming and denying.</hi> As if the trueth of no matter neede to be <hi>confirmed by oath,</hi> sauing where there is first a <hi>iudiciall contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersie.</hi> Yet he himselfe speaking afore of the endes of an oath, made no mention of this <hi>trueth</hi> in controuersie; vnlesse hee will say, that he confounded the second of these ends with the last. Furthermore, what <hi>controuersie</hi> was there betwixt <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his seruant: or betwixt one that tendereth, and a <hi>Iustice</hi> of peace, or other, that taketh an oath to the <hi>Supremacie?</hi> Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse, it hath bene often declared, that the very meanes, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducements which open way to <hi>Enquirie</hi> in proceeding of <hi>Office;</hi> are as a <hi>partie</hi> that chargeth the other; and so a <hi>iudiciall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersie</hi> dependeth. And that there neede not to be any other <hi>formall partie</hi> alwayes in iudgement, is many wayes shewed in the second part, euen by <note n="1" place="margin">Vide part. 2. ca. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>criminall proceedings</hi> mentioned in <hi>Scripture.</hi> yea what <hi>Scripture</hi> is there to require alwayes a <hi>partie promouent,</hi> as of necessitie? Thirdly, there is euen here a kinde of <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>testatio litis,</hi> or ioyning of issue in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> proceeding of <hi>meere Office:</hi> viz. betwixt the <hi>denunciation, fame,</hi> or some other inducement as it were affirming, and charging: and the <hi>parties</hi> deniall, that is conuented. which point answereth also to that other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his, by which hee would prooue; that <hi>Iustice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is not mainteined,</hi> because <hi>there be not three persons in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Furthermore, if such <hi>Iustice</hi> and <hi>Iudiciall</hi> course <hi>by three,</hi> were necessary in euery <hi>lawfull oath,</hi> by the worde of God: then should all <hi>Promissorie</hi> oathes bee vtterly vnlawfull. In which, there be but the partie <hi>promising,</hi> and he to whome the <hi>promise</hi> is made: yet not <hi>iudicially,</hi> for the most part.</p>
                     <p>He goeth further, and to prooue that <hi>an ende of controuersie</hi> cannot <hi>ensue vpon such oath;</hi> he vseth (in effect) his next prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reason, viz. <hi>because no quarell, nor complaint is anyway de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending.</hi> First there is <hi>a complaint made, and depending,</hi> before such oath be tendered; and I haue shewed howe. Secondly, if there were not, yet <hi>an ende of controuersie might thereupon ensue,</hi> in that the partie burdened by presumptions; might (perhaps) thereupon be cleared and dismissed; and so the matter in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:19125:242"/>
ended. Thirdly, doe not the Lordes of the <hi>Counsell,</hi> and doe not <hi>Iudges</hi> and <hi>Iustices</hi> of Peace (oftentimes) lawfully exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine sometimes <hi>parties</hi> onely, and sometimes <hi>witnesses;</hi> euen where no <hi>Iudiciall sute dependeth?</hi> Lastly, hee mistaketh the place in the <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Hebrewes;</hi> if hee imagine that vpon any single mans oath taken, euery <hi>controuersie,</hi> should (thereby) presently be decided and determine, according to that oath: which matter resteth to be shewed <note n="*" place="margin">Cap. huius part. vltimo.</note> hereafter.</p>
                     <p>He sayeth also, that it rather maketh more <hi>contention,</hi> then endeth <hi>controuersie.</hi> Indeede, hee, or such other mislikers haue thereupon (of very late time) taken occasion to make great stirres and <hi>contentions</hi> in this Church, and common weale. But assuredly, this oath (otherwise) tendeth to ending of matters doubtfull, and in question; either by the punishment, or else by the clearing of defendants; and not to procure any <hi>accusation</hi> as he surmiseth, and calleth it: which is knowen and entred into, afore any oath be tendered.</p>
                     <p>Yet <hi>Innocents hereby</hi> (sayth he) <hi>are not cleared, since there is no complaint or accusation, iudicially exhibited.</hi> as though a man <hi>priuately</hi> charged with some offence towards his neighbor; may not also <hi>priuately</hi> cleare, and approoue his innocencie, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gritie vnto him, by his <hi>oath;</hi> except there were first a <hi>publike iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall</hi> complaint, or accusation presented vp betwixt them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, I haue afore shewed, that many oathes may lawfully be tendered and taken, where none ende of <hi>clearing Innocents,</hi> but rather of charging <hi>nocents,</hi> is propounded. Thirdly, it may fall out, that by such oath, <hi>Innocents shalbe cleared;</hi> in case no preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant proofe shall afterward be brought.</p>
                     <p>But if all these <hi>endes</hi> must concurre vnto euery lawfull oath; how is the <hi>Treatisour</hi> constant with himselfe: at least, how doeth his former argument holde, whereby hee would confute these oaths, for that <hi>they were neither</hi> (saith he) <hi>for assurance of duetie, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, contract, or promise, neither yet for confirmation of trueth in controuersie?</hi> for if any one of these last recited wil serue, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine the lawfulnes of an oath; then what need all the other <hi>ends</hi> iointly? &amp; if some one of these must (necessarily) be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in euery lawful oth; then to what purpose serue those other seueral ends of oathes, here not required, nor mentioned: viz. that <hi>honor may
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:19125:243"/>
be giuen to God, Innocencie protected, and Iustice mainteined?</hi> Seing there may be <hi>assurance of dutie, couenant, contract, or promise giuen,</hi> without any seeking to <hi>glorifie God</hi> thereby: as heathens othes of obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to their superiors; &amp; any other mens oathes, for assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of <hi>promises,</hi> &amp;c. without respect to <hi>protection</hi> of <hi>Innocencie,</hi> and without such <hi>Iudiciall</hi> course; namely, as may happen in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>merce, betwixt man &amp; man. From these reasons by him <hi>simply</hi> propounded; I wil now come to his reasons, by way of <hi>co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison.</hi> He co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demneth this othe by <hi>comparing</hi> it to <hi>Herods</hi> othe; that as that was <hi>generall,</hi> to <hi>giue</hi> whatsoeuer the damsell woulde aske; so these are to <hi>answere,</hi> whatsoeuer shal bee demaunded.</p>
                     <p>This his imputation vnto <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> courtes of tendering such <hi>generall oathes,</hi> which he so often, and almost onely beateth vpon, to the entent to giue a better lustre to the weakenes of the cause he defendeth: I haue (as seueral occasions haue bene giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) declared to be a meere slaunder. Neuerthelesse, it was not the <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralitie</hi> of <hi>Herods</hi> othe which was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>demned. For the prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> made vnto y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>king,</hi> as <hi>generall</hi> a <hi>promise</hi> of <hi>answering</hi> what he would demaunde of him; as <hi>Herod</hi> made of <hi>giuing,</hi> vnto the dauncing damsell. But it was the rashe vnaduisednes of it, rising vpon a carnall delight: and when he had made it, a more vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full performance, of a thing <hi>simply wicked:</hi> which are the things, therein to be condemned.</p>
                     <p>Next to his collections by discourse of reason, I place his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres vnto <hi>obiections;</hi> which are supposed may be made for esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing <hi>general othes,</hi> or other more particular, yet in causes <hi>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal</hi> to the partie examined. The first of which; is that of <note n="1" place="margin">Ioann. 18. v. 19. 20. 21.</note> the high <hi>Priests,</hi> who <hi>examined Christ of his disciples and doctrine:</hi> &amp; he put them of, to <hi>those that heard him:</hi> saying, <hi>he had spoken nothing in secret.</hi> But, neither answering to <hi>interrogatories</hi> being so <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> as this was, nor general othes are defended. And if they were, yet it is not the example of the <hi>high Priest,</hi> refelled by <hi>Christ,</hi> that any would alledge; as he pleasantly doth insinuate, to bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den them, and the cause with the greater weight of enuie, and preiudice. But touching this obiection &amp; the true vnderstanding thereof, more fully in the next Chapter, as in a more fit place.</p>
                     <p>Touching the next supposed <hi>obiection,</hi> (he saith) <hi>It is not any sufficient allegation to saye; that the partie deponent is no further
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:19125:243"/>
bound to answere, then the lawe requireth, how generall soeuer his oath be; since it is not safe for the conscience of such a deponent, to stand vpon termes, and questions; how farre by lawe, and by what law, he is bound to answere.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Not safe for his conscience, &amp;c?</hi> is not this plainly and directly to leaue it vnto the libertie, &amp; free choise of ech <hi>deponent,</hi> in eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cause whatsoeuer, to refuse to take any oath? the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which, what can giue greater strength vnto that detestable error of <hi>Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme?</hi> for if it be <hi>not safe for his conscience, to put it vpon the question, how farre by law he is bound:</hi> then may, and also ought the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptist,</hi> and euery other fantastike, to be a Iudge for himselfe; whether to take any oath at all, or onely so far, and in what cause himselfe listeth, vnder pretense of his conscience. In that hee saith, <hi>how farre by lawe, &amp;c.</hi> it seemeth to me, that he is in doubt; both, that <hi>Gods lawe and all the lawes of the land</hi> are against the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusall</hi> of such <hi>oathe;</hi> and yet that hee would (neuerthelesse) arme all deponents against taking this oath, because <hi>it may not be done</hi> (forsooth) <hi>with a safe conscie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.</hi> In y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he further addeth, <hi>and by what law;</hi> it is probable, he would thereby insinuate; that howsoeuer it wil not be thought good by many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be resused, when it shalbe imposed in courts of the <hi>temporol law:</hi> yet if the same oath be imposed by force of <hi>ecclesiastical</hi> law, that it cannot then be so <hi>safe,</hi> vnto the <hi>deponents conscience.</hi> Assuredly, it is most strange, that men pretending such pietie, and sinceritie; will teach others thus to dally, with lawes, and with their owne consciences. as if the thing were godly enough to be exacted in one <hi>court;</hi> but pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rillous to <hi>conscience</hi> in another Court: albeit as well authorised vnto the one, as it is vnto the other.</p>
                     <p>Insomuch, as here he yeeldeth, that this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dition of not being <hi>bound by any such oth taken further then law requireth;</hi> is obserued, or vnderstood, in ministring the oths which he impugneth: doth he not thereby plainely discouer himselfe, to be an oppugner of that, which is but by law vrged? and an encourager of others to oppose the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues against lawes? or else it must follow, that none that be in authoritie do know the <hi>lawe</hi> therein, besides himselfe; or at least will not deliuer it truly. doth he not also therein imply, that (in some cases) the lawes allow of such oathes; and that his charge, of ministring oathes that are <hi>generall,</hi> vnto all a mans
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:19125:244"/>
                        <hi>thoughts, words and deedes,</hi> is a plaine slander? insomuch as no law requireth that, and yet the takers of this oathe; are no further bound, then the law it selfe bindeth.</p>
                     <p>And lastly it appeareth hereby, if these oths (restrained but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which law requires) be neuertheles <hi>vniust, cruel, vngodly,</hi> &amp; <hi>tyrannicall.</hi> that then the lawes of this realme establishing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, must needes endure, his like hard, vntrue, and disloyall censure.</p>
                     <p>It hath bin often, and no lesse truly said; that none but <hi>Iesuites, Seminary priests,</hi> &amp; such like obstinate <hi>Papists</hi> haue refused this oth in hir Maiesties time, or haue charged it to be vngodly; vntil these new <hi>reforming Innouators</hi> did start vp: &amp; that both the sorts of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do build vpon the selfe same grounds of argument. In answer of this, he saith; that by the ancient &amp; godly writing entituled, <hi>The praier, and complaint of the Plowman,</hi> it appeareth; <hi>that this kind of generall othes, and examinations ex officio mero were not first misliked by Iesuites, and Seminarie Priests; and from them deriued to others, that mislike gouernement, and would bring the Church to an Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie; as the world hath bene borne in hand.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For <hi>general oaths,</hi> we stand not: but who first <hi>misliked</hi> exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>ex officio mero,</hi> or which of these two sorts of mislikers haue troden in the others steps by imitation; is not so material: as with what trueth, or soundnes of reason, it is misliked by either of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I haue not the <hi>Ploughmans</hi> booke to peruse, what is (indeed) there said here of; neither greatly skilleth it, though he were (perhaps) a good <hi>diuine,</hi> disguised vnder a <hi>ploughmans</hi> title and stile. If he had vsed any reason for his saying, I doubt not but the <hi>Treatisour</hi> would haue enforced it.

                        <hi>Origen,</hi> which he quoteth; I find two sayings touching oaths, the one of which it is likely he meant. Indeed <hi>we find</hi> (saith <hi>Origen) in the law, the vse of Adiuring; as in the booke of</hi>

                        <hi>of Kings, but I am of opinion, that a man which will liue according to the Gospell, ought not to adiure another. for not to adiure at all, is like to that commandement of the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in the gospell; thou shalt not sweare at all.</hi> And againe, <hi>it had not beene seemly, that the Lord, vpon the adiuration of the high priest, should haue answered him, as though he had bene thereunto compelled against his owne will: and therefore he neither denied himselfe to bee the Christ the sonne of God, nor yet plainely confessed it.</hi>
                     </p>

in priuat causes; seems to me, to be apt, &amp; very sound. <hi>In him that exacteth an</hi>

                        <hi>oath</hi> (saith he) <hi>there is great difference, whether he know not, that the other wil sweare false, or indeed knoweth that he wil. For if he know not, and therefore do say, sweare vnto me: it is not sinne then to sweare for his satisfaction, howbeit it is an humane weakenesse in the exacter. But if the case be so, that he which exacteth it, knoweth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther party to haue done it; and yet will compell him to sweare,</hi> who is ready thereupon to sweare falsely; <hi>then is the exacter a very mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer. for though the one do murder his owne soule, by his periury: yet the other that so exacted it, did</hi>

                     <p>Touching the third, and last point, viz. if their writings by him quoted against oathes, be not directed against them in any of the 2. former respects: then it is, in regard of the vnaduisednes of such oths take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or for that the matter wherof the party sware, was not in his own power to perform. This may be shewed by a place yet vnexamined, which he quoted out of <hi>Chrysostome.</hi> For he <note n="2" place="margin">Chrys. hom. 14. ad pop.

                        <note n="3" place="margin">Ambros. in psal. 118. ser. 14. col. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Ambrose</hi> in the place quoted, speaketh to none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpose. for writing vpon these words, <hi>I haue sworne, and haue purposed to keepe the iudgements of thy righteousnesse,</hi> saith thus: <hi>No man sweares well, but he that may know what hee sweares: to sweare then is the iudgement of knowledge, and the witnes of the conscience, &amp;c. haue light, that is the knowledge of the trueth afore thee, when thou disposest thy selfe to take an oathe, so shal not the bond therof hurt thee. The Lord, who came to teach the yong ones, to instruct nouices, and to confirme the persite; saith in the Gospell, sweare not at all: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hee spake to those, that were weake. to bee shorte, hee spake not this to the Apostles apart, but to the multitudes. for he therfore would not haue thee to sweare, lest thou for sweare &amp;c.</hi> and a little afterward thus: <hi>Follow not therefore any mans example in swearing, if it lie not in thy power to obserue, and fulfill what thou swearest.</hi>

And so what here, and what in other places afore (as they fell in most fitly) I haue answered (I trust) althe <hi>Note-gatherers</hi> quotations taken out of the <hi>ancient Fathers,</hi> and other old Writers.</p>
                     <p>Whereby (I hope) is iustified that which I writ in <hi>the epistle to the Reader;</hi> that most of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that pertain to this matter of <hi>oaths;</hi> may seeme to haue bene collected together, against al taking of <hi>oaths</hi> whatsoeuer (though being truely vnderstood as the same places do expound, no such matter followeth thereon) rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make any shew against <hi>oaths</hi> in <hi>criminal</hi> causes; which some of those places do (in truth, as you haue heard) plainly establish, and none do condemne or disallow. And it appeareth likewise, that they can no way be retched out, to touch oathes in causes of <hi>crimes;</hi> except wee expound them absolutely to condemne all oathes: which to impute vnto those fathers were great iniurie and vntruth; and yet no way aduantageable to this cause.</p>

the fift, a <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> the words thereof, which he meaneth, I take it, are these: <hi>publike crimes are committed to my iudgement, vpon the parties willing confession, or vpon proofe by witnesses: but those that are hidden, and vnknowen, are to be left to him, who one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knoweth the heartes of the children of men.</hi> In that the <hi>confession</hi> (here spoken of) is required to be <hi>voluntarie;</hi> perhappes hee meant absolutely to inferre; that no man may be vrged (by his oath) <hi>to confesse a crime.</hi> But what the matter was, and the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, are first wel to be weied. The doubt there propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and to be answered, was this: <hi>When yong infants are founde dead in bed with their parents; whether the parents were to bee put to the vulgar purgation, of enduring hote burning yron, or scalding water, thereby to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

The case then being such; the parents might not (by lawe) be put to any <hi>purgation</hi> at all. For the <hi>vulgar</hi> aforesaid, is vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full; and they could not be put to their <hi>Canonical purgation:</hi> inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as thereby <note n="1" place="margin">c. quotiens de purgat.

Videamus. ff. de in litem iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rando.</note> may not be imposed. For if they shoulde directly haue sworne that they did not oppresse, or smother their infant; in so great vncertaintie thereof (as must needes be, whiles men be on sleepe) it might happen: that thereby they should (in deede) be periured; though not knowing certainely, whether they had so done or not.

                        <hi>Interpreters</hi> doe wholly agree, that this was the onely reason, why an <hi>oathe</hi> might not (in that case) be imposed: &amp; not any regard which was had (simply) to condemne all <hi>vrging</hi> of men, vnto confession of their <hi>crimes.</hi>

Oflater <hi>Diuines,</hi> he also quoteth <hi>Tyndall,</hi> in seueral places of his works. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first of these, I take it these <note n="1" place="margin">Tyndall in 5. Matth. pag 208.</note> words of <hi>Tyndal</hi> be meant: <hi>neither ought a Iudge</hi> (saith <hi>Tyndall) to compell a man to sweare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst himselfe, that he make him not sinne and forsweare.</hi> he yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth then (by implication) that in some cases a superiour may compell his inferior to sweare: and so much doe his words next precedent importe. Indeede we all confesse, that where there is great &amp; <hi>apparant probabilitie,</hi> that the party is such a man, who wil rather <hi>for sweare,</hi> then confesse a trueth against himself; vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> such a man, an oath should not be imposed: But where the penaltie is not <hi>capitall,</hi> nor of <hi>mutilation,</hi> nor none other particular strong presumption to induce such suspition touching the partie; and especially where he stands afore charged vpon good, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable grounds, to haue (in deede) committed such a fact; there the lawe will not intend, or presume; but that he will make fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther discouery, rather then to be forsworne: <hi>quia nemo praesumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur immemor salutis aeternae,</hi> as afore hath bene aleaged.</p>
                     <p>Albeit <hi>Tyndall</hi> seeme in this place to insinuate (&amp; that truely) that in some other cases, an inferior may be compelled to take an oath: Yet in the next place quoted, he taketh away <hi>all necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> oathes, and leaueth none but <hi>voluntarie.</hi> whereby his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this matter of oaths (though otherwise a godly <hi>martyr)</hi> is much lightened. <hi>No Iudge</hi> (saith he) <hi>ought to make a man sweare</hi>

                        <hi>against his will, for many inconueniences. If a man receiue an office, he that putteth him in the roume, ought to charge him to doe it truely, and may, and happily ought, to take an oath of him. If a man offer himselfe to beare witnesse, the Iudge may, and of some (happily) ought to take an oath: but to compell a man to beare witnesse, he ought not.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I would gladly hereupon aske a question of the <hi>Notegatherer</hi> (who presseth vs with this mans iudgement) whether hee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe doe (as the words lye) allow absolutely of this, and of other his writings; both concerning <hi>oathes</hi> and other matters? If hee doe not, but somewhere reiect him; then must hee giue vs leaue also to leaue him; and not to beleeue him; in case he condemne all <hi>necessarie</hi> oathes imposed by <hi>Superiours</hi> vpon <hi>inferiors,</hi> so well warranted vnto vs by <hi>Scripture,</hi> both in <hi>humane,</hi> and in <hi>diuine</hi> matters. But if <hi>Tyndall</hi> meane but hereby to disalowe, <hi>absolute compulsion</hi> to take oathes in <hi>worldly</hi> matters, then may his speech
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:19125:248"/>
be better accepted. For vpon refusall thereof in these matters, the lawes appoint not the parties to be <hi>tortured</hi> till hee doe it, which were <hi>an absolute compulsion:</hi> but either doe punish his contumacie, and disobedience, to the example of others; or els doe pronou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce him <hi>pro confesso,</hi> which is but a <hi>causatiue compulsion.</hi> And if <hi>Tyndall</hi> be thought in his wordes (afore) to condemne also euery <hi>causatiue</hi> or <hi>inducing compulsion:</hi> then doeth hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary himselfe. for in his owne example of an oath giuen at ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of an <hi>office,</hi> there is this <hi>causatiue compulsion</hi> to be found. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is no man but by his good will, had rather omit such oath, then to take it: &amp; if he take it not, then is he to be put back, from bearing that <hi>office;</hi> which is at least a <hi>causatiue compulsion</hi> in case he desire the <hi>office.</hi> but if he be vnwilling to haue such <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> and yet may haue (as <hi>Tyndall</hi> sayth) an oath imposed, then some oathes may be exacted, and all be not <hi>voluntarie</hi> onely.</p>
                     <p>It is not safe, nor sound, to imbrace without all choise, or dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, whatsoeuer any godly, or learned man hath holden. for being men, sometime they faile, and sometimes (through heate of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tradiction) they haue their affections like vnto others.

But if those examples he coulde haue brought, be like (as he saith) to that of <hi>Sir Iohn Old-castles, Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots, Cranmers,</hi> or <hi>Lamberts:</hi> then are they not <hi>like</hi> to serue his turne; for none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> refused, in respect they were to be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of matters <hi>criminall,</hi> as it commeth to be discussed hereafter.</p>

And this answere may serue vnto all his quotations touching examples of <hi>omission;</hi> as of <hi>William Swinderby,</hi> and others, which are brought by him to shewe, <hi>proceedings to haue beene in England against Heretiques, without exacting an oath.</hi> Besides, it is not the exacting of an oath in <hi>heresie,</hi> but in other <hi>crimes</hi> Ecclesiasticall, that we doe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally mainteine: howsoeuer he doe seeme, rather to allowe it in matter of <hi>faith,</hi> then in others of lesse <hi>moment.</hi> Thirdly, if when they were proceeded with in those countries, <hi>they knew the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter first:</hi> then is not that true which he said afore of them, viz. that their refusals were <hi>like</hi> vnto that of the (aforenamed) mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of <hi>England.</hi> And by this word <hi>first,</hi> he seemeth at vnawares, to implie a confession, that they were neuerthelesse examined af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward by their <hi>oathes:</hi> howsoeuer in the selfe same sentence he denie it.

Fifthly, the ground of his mislike, is rather vpon the order of time, when the oath is ministred; then for the <hi>Criminall</hi> matter, which we speake of. Lastly, vpon an <hi>accusers instance,</hi> an oath cannot be ministred in any crime by the <hi>Ciuill</hi> lawe, which those Countries mentioned, doe most followe; much lesse then vpon an <hi>accusation</hi> of <hi>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Gainst the <hi>ministring</hi> and <hi>taking</hi> of this <hi>oath</hi> by a mans owne selfe; the <hi>Innouatours</hi> doe also holde sundrie opinions; and doe make many other <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iections</hi> and <hi>arguments,</hi> meete to be viewed, and briefly, as may be, answered.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="179" facs="tcp:19125:250"/>
It may not be looked for, that I should touch them all; because not many of them are come to mine handes; neither (if they were) will leasure serue, nor if it would serue, were it worth the while, they be so friuolous. but especially because their conceits, and opinions (in this behalfe) are so manifold, so variable, and intricated with such contradictions one against another, and of the same man against himselfe; as (I doe assure you) it is a worke of more labour, to set downe certainely, what they holde about this matter; then to confute them. But it is meete that errours should so be, viz. diuided into many heads, one of them hissing against another: howsoeuer they be tied together by the tayles like <hi>Samsons</hi> foxes, to set both <hi>Church &amp; Common wealth</hi> on fire.</p>
                     <p>So neere as I can collect them, their opinions be of foure sortes. The first is of those; who being required to take such oath, truely to answere the matters, whereof they be brought into question (the chiefe heads whereof, are also made knowen first vnto them) will answere neither yea, nor nay, either tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the trueth of the matters, or what they resolue to doe, but onely thus, viz. if you haue matters against me that be <hi>manifest,</hi> then proceede to prooue them by witnesses: if they be hidden, then tarie <hi>till the Lord come, who will</hi> 
                        <note n="1" place="margin">1. Cor. 4. <abbr>V.</abbr> 5.</note> 
                        <hi>lighten things that are hidden in darkenesse, and make the Counsels of the hearts manifest.</hi> And these (commonly) will call for an <hi>accuser.</hi> And if it be tolde them, that the <hi>common voyce,</hi> a <hi>presentment,</hi> or other <hi>iudiciall denunciation,</hi> or the <hi>publike interest</hi> &amp;c. is their <hi>accuser,</hi> that brings them into question, then come they againe to the first poynt, and bid their <hi>accusers,</hi> and their <hi>witnesses</hi> to come, and stand forth against them.</p>
                     <p>This dealing, as it is most <hi>peremptorie</hi> and <hi>franticke</hi> of all the rest, so it is most vnreasonable and dangerous: for it tendeth to the taking away of all <hi>Iudiciall</hi> courses, both <hi>criminall,</hi> and <hi>Ciuill.</hi> To what purpose should a man produce witnesses, before the defendant hath answered directly, what hee confesseth, and what he denieth, and would haue prooued?</p>
                     <p>Neither is this to deale sincerely, iustly, and vprightly, as we woulde haue others to deale with vs. For we should speake the trueth one to another, and not seeke to circumuent any, by cautels, and <hi>frustratorie shifts;</hi> but least of all in matter of
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:19125:251"/>
iudgement: where, by law, and by the Magistrate (that is <hi>lex lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quens)</hi> we are required, and be (in conscience) also bound to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, that controuersies doubtfull, may be composed with least adoe, and trouble. to the intent, that which is right and trueth in euery cause (expedient to be knowen) may quickly be knowen, and come to light. Such froward answeres as this is, doe rather put off the <hi>Iudge</hi> with <hi>contempt</hi> and <hi>disda<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                              <desc>•…</desc>
                           </gap>e,</hi> then yeelde any good reason, why such oath should be refused.</p>
                     <p>This pretended <hi>dilemma</hi> of theirs, hath many <hi>media</hi> or meanes, to make it easie to be dissolued. First, a <hi>crime</hi> may be so <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fested,</hi> that the supposed offender becomes (thereby) noted, <hi>infamed</hi> and <hi>scandalous;</hi> and therefore fit to be <hi>enquired</hi> of; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit happely the thing be done so <hi>couertly,</hi> or of his owne nature be so <hi>hidden;</hi> as it cannot be exactly prooued by witnesses. For wicked, and lewde persons make all prouision that may be, that there may be no witnesses, of their wickednesse. And therefore it is meete, that such (being probably touched) that witnesse <hi>instar omnium</hi> be vsed, and called on by them; who knoweth all things, &amp; before whom the whole world stands as a <note n="1" place="margin">Apocal. 4. v. 6.</note> sea of <hi>pure Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall.</hi> Some examples of such <hi>crimes</hi> are shewed in the eleuenth Chapter, by the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And what shall witnesses neede, if the partie himselfe will not denie it? Or what if the witnesses be not meete to be knowen at first, least the <hi>partie</hi> vpon his oath, or otherwise, discouer no more (when he once knoweth them) then he supposeth by them can be deposed? Or what if (at the parties first conuenting) no wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses be knowen, that can testifie, but doe come afterward vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Iudges</hi> knowledge?</p>
                     <p>Touching <hi>hidden</hi> crimes (if they be <hi>simply</hi> hidden, and in such sorte, as is meant by that place of <hi>S. Paul,</hi> and by the like rules in lawe) it is very true; that they are not to bee <hi>enquired</hi> after, by any Magistrate, neither is any man bound to reueale such. Therefore it may not bee asked of any man (as was done in <hi>Popish shrift)</hi> what faults and sinnes hee knoweth by himselfe. Such be the <hi>counsels,</hi> and secrete thoughts of <hi>mens hearts,</hi> spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of by <hi>Saint Paul</hi> in that place, and all actions also not come abroade at all, nor <hi>manifested,</hi> either by <hi>fame,</hi> or by other good <hi>presumptions,</hi> or <hi>euidences.</hi> For before they be (at least) so
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:19125:251"/>
                        <hi>manifested,</hi> it is not of any possibilitie, to make <hi>enquirie</hi> or questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after particular <hi>crimes,</hi> when they bee not so much as suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be done. Concerning which <hi>crimes,</hi> what the law <hi>Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall,</hi> and practise is, I referre you to the ninth chapter of this third part. But if they shall be once so <hi>manifested</hi> abroad, (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is declared) then is not the fault <hi>simplie hidden,</hi> but in part is manifested, and brought to light; and therefore is it fit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient; that the <hi>partie</hi> be either <hi>cleared</hi> of it, or <hi>corrected</hi> for it.</p>
                     <p>Besides, that place of S. <hi>Paul</hi> is not meant of any <hi>Iudiciall</hi> proceedings; but of <hi>priuate,</hi> rash, and vncharitable iudging of our brother (in the worst part) without any iust ground there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; as if wee would take vpon vs <hi>Gods</hi> owne office, and would iudge the inward cogitations of another mans heart. Such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse iudging, our Sauiour <hi>Christ</hi> also <note n="1" place="margin">Matth. 7. v. 1. Rom. 2. v. 1.</note> condemneth in the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell.</hi> But it pertaineth nothing vnto such <hi>enquirie by oath,</hi> as the <hi>Magistrate</hi> hath good <hi>enducements,</hi> and <hi>presumptions</hi> for, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into.</p>
                     <p>Another sorte, no lesse pernicious then the former are those, who will pretend not to refuse to take an oath in a cause <hi>crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall:</hi> but yet they will doe it with this <hi>limitation and protestation,</hi> that they entend not thereby to be bound, either to <hi>accuse</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, or their brethren. By <hi>accusation,</hi> meaning the reuealing of any thing; for which they, or their brethren, may be troubled or punished.</p>
                     <p>Vpon what ground, other then the generall reasons of the rest, and of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> (as if it were against <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>charitie, &amp;c.)</hi> these should build this opinion; I (for my part) cannot wel coniecture. But it sorteth to this passe; that seeing we are all <hi>bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and members one of another;</hi> therefore it shall not be lawful for the <hi>Magistrate</hi> to punish any sinne or transgression, sauing where himselfe doeth take the offender with the <hi>maner:</hi> yea and scarse then too. For they will hardly (I beleeue) allowe, that the same man shall be <hi>accuser, witnesse,</hi> and <hi>Iudge.</hi> For they conceiue (howbeit erroneouslie) the <hi>Iudge</hi> who proceedeth of <hi>office;</hi> to be an <hi>accuser.</hi> This plainlie followeth of it, because no sinne may lawfully be punished, but where the partie is <hi>conuicted.</hi> There can be none other <hi>conuiction,</hi> but either by the parties owne <hi>confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or vpon <hi>depositions of witnesses.</hi> So that if no <hi>Christian</hi> be bound,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:19125:252"/>
nor ought (before a <hi>Magistrate)</hi> to reueale either his <hi>owne,</hi> or his <hi>brothers</hi> offences; then doeth it followe, that crimes shall neuer be punished, till the offenders themselues (being moued in conscience, if happily they shall euen then, by these men be suffered, to <hi>accuse,</hi> or <hi>discouer</hi> themselues) shal wilfully come in, and desire (for Gods sake) to be hanged vp, or otherwise puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed; as the qualitie of their offence leadeth.</p>
                     <p>Amongst the heathens, I reade of no nation, but they vsed and had oathes in great estimation, and necessarie practise; sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <note n="1" place="margin">Alex. ab Alex. Genial. Dierum. li. 5. cap. 10.</note> the <hi>foolish Phrygians,</hi> who onely condemned them. And amongst <hi>Christians,</hi> the olde heretikes <hi>Manichees;</hi> of later times, the <hi>Anabaptistes;</hi> and now lastly these fellowes. who (albeit not in plaine wordes) yet in very deede, doe (vpon the matter) take away all oathes in matters <hi>criminall,</hi> and consequently all, both <hi>Ciuill,</hi> and <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> punishments and censures, from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men. For <note n="2" place="margin">Cyprian. in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posit. Symboli.</note> 
                        <hi>Manes</hi> the olde heretique taught; that it was not lawfull for Christians to sweare at all.</p>
                     <p>The third sort of opinions (being deliuered by diuers of the more learned sorte of the <hi>Innouatours)</hi> are of such, as holde; that they may reueale both their owne, and their brothers <hi>crimes and offences, to remoue euill from the land</hi> (as they speake) when they are duely charged thereunto by oathe. But some actions there be, which they beleeue to be well, and lawfully done; and yet by lawe, or iniquitie of the time, they holde to be such, as may bring trouble, and punishment vpon them. And those, (they saye) they are bound in conscience, not to declare at all. This opinion for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> first part thereof, is directly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie, to the next afore precedent.</p>
                     <p>But who shall iudge, whether such matters, as they be <hi>enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red</hi> of, ought to be accounted for faults and offenses, and which being punished, <hi>will remoue euill from the land;</hi> or whether they be (in deed and trueth) good &amp; <hi>vertuous actions?</hi> I greatly feare, that these men wil not (in this point) be content to be ouer-ruled, either by the <hi>lawes</hi> of the Realme, or by the <hi>Magistrates,</hi> &amp; <hi>Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> that be interpreters of the lawes. But (no remedie) an <hi>oathe</hi> they will not take, till they shalbe satisfied, and resolued (which they can make as long in doing, as them selues lust) that such <hi>actions</hi> be iustly and lawfully to be condemned, for <hi>Crimes</hi> and offenses, by Gods lawe. So that this is nothing else, then to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:19125:252"/>
vnto euery priuate subiect the iudgement how farre, in what causes, and against whom he needeth to declare his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, of anymatter: how expedient soeuer for <hi>her Maiestie,</hi> and vnto the whole common-wealth it be, to be knowen. Is not this to put a sure buckler into the hands of <hi>Iesuites,</hi> other <hi>traitors, murderers, felons,</hi> and euery lewde companion, to holde foorth against the lawfull <hi>examination</hi> of <hi>Magistrates,</hi> touching themselues, or their complices? For if they neede not declare any thing by <hi>oathe;</hi> much lesse will they haue conscience to doe it, when they are not sworne: which forbearing of the <hi>parties</hi> own oath in examination of <hi>crimes</hi> (that may be <hi>capitall</hi> to him) is alwayes obserued in this <hi>Realme.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Perhappes, vnto this absurditie, following of their opinion, it wil be said; that those aboue rehearsed, are knowen and <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest crimes</hi> to allmen, euen by the light of nature: but so are not their <hi>Disciplinarie,</hi> and <hi>Synodicall</hi> Constitutions &amp;c. It is true, that <hi>treason, murther, theft,</hi> and such like; <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, euen in their generall nature, are condemned for <hi>crimes</hi> by all men. Yet when men come <hi>ad</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> to the particular application of their owne factes vnto the <hi>generall crime:</hi> they are then contented to flatter with their consciences, and to please them selues in their owne acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and so with such, and such <hi>circumstances</hi> to deny theirs, to be in any like degree. Doe the <hi>Iesuites</hi> (thinke ye) when they are conuented, condemne their lewde seducing of her <hi>Maiesties</hi> subiectes, as treasonable? did the damnable conspirators with <hi>Babington</hi> the traytor (albeit they were not ignorant, what the lawes of the land did adiudge of their actions) when they went about their treasons, condemne themselues as traytors: and not rather lewdly flatter them selues vpon some circumstances, which they thought should assoyle them of all guilt afore God? Therefore this opinion, though it cary a colourable shewe of some greater <hi>obedience:</hi> yet when the reckonning is cast vp, it iumpeth (in very deede) with the second. For it commeth to this point, that euery man shalbe his owne <hi>Iudge,</hi> how fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>e he neede to obeye <hi>lawes,</hi> and <hi>Magistrates,</hi> that require him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer his knowledge, touching his owne or other mens factes; so he himselfe will account them, lawfully done.</p>
                     <p>Besides the absurdities, that followe this opinion, it is also in it
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:19125:253"/>
selfe very vnreasonable: For if a man may reueale his brothers, or his owne sinne, may he not much more his vertue? If God be glorified in detecting of <hi>sinne,</hi> much more in making <hi>vertues</hi> knowen. If trueth must needs be vttered of <hi>sinne,</hi> much more of vertue; for <hi>wisedome is iustified of her children.</hi> If their doings be good, &amp; instifiable, then to conceale the trueth, is (in very trueth) nothing lesse, then to betray and forsake the trueth.</p>
                     <p>And that this is but a vaine glosse, deuised, in trueth, to couer their <hi>misdemeanours,</hi> and to escape from deserued punishment: may appeare, by the desire they carrie (by all wayes, &amp; meanes) to cloke their sayd actions.</p>
                     <p>If their workes were not of darkenesse, and secrecie; they would not flie the light. For it is a propertie of <hi>those which doe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill,</hi> to flie from the light. If their doings be workes of the light, <hi>let that light shine foorth before men, that they may see those their goodworks, and glorifie their father which is in heauen.</hi> If they stand assured, they haue done but well, what punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t soeuer should light vpon them for it, they should confesse their obedience, and <hi>T. C.</hi> practise of the whole <hi>Gospell of Christ,</hi> (whereof they make their <hi>discipline</hi> a necessarie part) and reioyce with the <hi>Apostles,</hi> that they are found woorthie to suffer punishment, for the <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinarian</hi> part of the <hi>Gospell.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But is not this strange, that where the most part of this <hi>Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plinarian</hi> humour, do thinke that they ought to discouer nothing of themselues, nor of their brethren, that is <hi>criminall:</hi> that yet these others, being fewer, shooting at the same markes, will (as they say) reueale their <hi>crimes</hi> onely, but nothing else; no not their <hi>owne,</hi> and their brethrens <hi>vertues</hi> and good deedes; belike for feare, least they should be counted to doe it, vpon some vayne glorie.</p>
                     <p>Yet this opinion giueth vs this aduantage, that if a man may lawfully reueale, and discouer, not onely his <hi>brothers,</hi> but his owne <hi>crimes</hi> and offenses, if they beetruely <hi>crimes:</hi> then haue they no colour, but they must doe it, when by the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> (according to lawe) and vpon their oath, they are so commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                     <p>That which they may <hi>lawfully</hi> doe, that may the <hi>Magistrate</hi> lawfully enioyne: and they (without disobedience to Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance)
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:19125:253"/>
may not refuse. So that for the lawfulnes of ministring an <hi>oathe</hi> to a <hi>partie,</hi> in a cause verily <hi>criminall,</hi> and thereby penall to himselfe (being a maine, and principall controuersie betwixt the <hi>State,</hi> and them) we haue allowance by some of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices owne <hi>positions;</hi> but yet wee cannot get their <hi>practise</hi> vnto it. But more hereof in the next Chapter.</p>
                     <p>The fourth and last of their opinions touching such oaths; see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to bee something better, (and euen perhaps <hi>Classicallie</hi> or <hi>Synodicallie)</hi> digested by them. Yet it caries no small <hi>contradiction</hi> in it selfe. which (to their most aduantage, that they can possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie haue it vnderstood) I will seeke, (by distinction) to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile, and to make stand together.</p>
                     <p>These therefore may be thought generally to holde, that for anything, whereof <hi>witnesses</hi> may be had, the <hi>partie</hi> may not bee examined vpon his <hi>oath.</hi> Out of which <hi>generall,</hi> they diduce this: that the <hi>Iudge</hi> may not examine a <hi>Preacher</hi> vpon his <hi>oathe,</hi> tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching his <hi>doctrine</hi> deliuered in publike place. And if he goe about it, the <hi>Preacher</hi> without breach of duetie to the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> may lawfully refuse to sweare. But if the <hi>crime</hi> be so <hi>hidden,</hi> and <hi>secret,</hi> that <hi>witnesses</hi> may not be had; then a man may bee charged (say they) by oath. But this they also limite, and restraine thus: so it bee not <hi>to drawe matter of accusation against themselues.</hi> And to this purpose, they doe vse seuen reasons. Albeit the same men also say, that <hi>to remooue euill from the lande,</hi> they will take such oathe. <hi>They will, &amp;c.</hi> But they tell vs not plainely whether they take themselues bound to doe it, or not. So that I cannot see, how to make these their opinions dwell peaceably together; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept their meaning herein be this: that for crimes which be <hi>hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> being in themselues euill (that is <hi>prohibita quia mala)</hi> they will be pleased to take an oathe to reueale them: but things that be <hi>secrete,</hi> where no <hi>witnesse</hi> can be had, and be none otherwaies <hi>euill,</hi> but because they be <hi>prohibited;</hi> such they may, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse to declare, by oath. which if they meane in deed, (as it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable they doe) then doe they runne quite contrary to the opinions of all men besides. For if it might be left to most mens choise; they would rather discouer of themselues and others, some breaches of <hi>Statutes,</hi> not directly sorbidden by <hi>Gods lawe:</hi> then such their owne <hi>crimes</hi> as be <hi>forbidden,</hi> and therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:19125:254"/>
more turpitude in them, as <hi>adulterie, periurie,</hi> and such like. But it must be remembred, that these men haue an odde grace in framing opinions of <hi>diuinitie, Pro re nata,</hi> euen as present oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions doe leade them. And they temper not their actions (of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes) vnto their former conceiued opinions; but they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue opinions, and coyne conceites: as may best stand for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense of their owne, and their fauorers present actions. Nowe, because many of them hope to bee found cleare (in their owne persons) from <hi>grosse</hi> and <hi>actuall crimes</hi> so expresly <hi>forbidden</hi> by Gods lawe; but not so cleare (perhappes) in breache of the <hi>lawes of this Realme,</hi> and peace of the <hi>Church:</hi> therefore is this newe opinion stamped by them, to stoppe vp this gappe. For the proofe of this their assertion; that <hi>where winesses may be had, there a man may not be examined vpon his oathe:</hi> First they saye, for Iudges finding out by <hi>Inquisition</hi> what is spoken, or done, they finde two wayes in <hi>Scripture.</hi> One by <hi>witnesse</hi> of others, where they may be had; which they goe about to proue by these <note n="1" place="margin">Deut. 13. v. 12. &amp; 15.

Neuerthelesse, by this their owne <hi>position,</hi> I thus proue against themselues; that they doe wickedly in refusing to take their oathes. Wheresoeuer in an <hi>Inquisition</hi> of a crime, no <hi>witnesses</hi> can be had, there (by the <hi>lawe of God)</hi> the parties themselues must take their <hi>oathes,</hi> and declare the whole trueth.

                     </p>
                     <p>Nowe I will examine their seuerall proofes, brought for this opinion. The first is this: <note n="1" place="margin">Deut. 13. v. 12. 13. 14. 15. &amp;c.</note> 
                        <hi>If thou shalt heare saye concerning any of the cities which the Lord thy God hath giuen thee to dwel in: wicked men are gone out from among you, and haue drawen away the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of their Citie, saying, let vs goe and serue other Gods, which ye haue not knowen: then thou shalt seeke, and make searche, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire diligently: and if it bee true, and the thing certaine, that such abhomination is wrought among you, thou shalt euen slay the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Citie with the edge of the sword; destroye it vtterly, and all that is therin, &amp; the cattel thereof, with the edge of the sword.</hi> Where you see, the punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is <hi>vniuersall</hi> (though the first perswasion came happely fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a fewe) and therefore the defection fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God vnto <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> was there, amongst the men also <hi>generall.</hi> For the iustice of God is; that <note n="2" place="margin">Ezech. 18. v. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>the soule which sinneth, that shall dye.</hi> How can this prooue, that no <hi>partie</hi> to the sinne was <hi>examined,</hi> but that they were conuinced onely by <hi>witnesses?</hi> Nay, the contrary
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:19125:255"/>
rather is manifest. For who is so fit, and so likely to haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things done in a Citie, as those that dwell in it? and therefore the lawe alloweth <hi>Citizens,</hi> for good <hi>witnesses</hi> of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters there done, euen when it is for their owne benefit: because (by common entendement) others cannot be had. I will aske then, whether this <hi>generall</hi> condemnation and execution against a <hi>whole citie,</hi> might proceede onely vpon <hi>hearesay?</hi> this were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vniust and cruel; and it is saide in the text, it must be knowen <hi>certeinely.</hi> But if vpon <hi>certeine,</hi> and sure conuiction; then can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not it be otherwise, then by the <hi>examination</hi> of some persons of that citie, who onely can knowe the <hi>certeintie</hi> thereof. But these are all <hi>parties, Quia quos par culpa, eosdem tenet &amp; par poena, &amp; è conuerso.</hi> For God hath appointed this <hi>negatiue</hi> Iustice in his lawe: that <note n="1" place="margin">Deut. 24. v. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>the father shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children put to death for the father: but euery man shall be put to death for his owne sinne.</hi> And in the <hi>Affirmatiue,</hi> it was decreed in a <hi>Councell</hi> thus: <note n="2" place="margin">Concil. Tolet. 4. Can. 78.</note> 
                        <hi>Oportet vt vna poena teneat obnoxios, quos, similis error inuenerit implicatos:</hi> such as be guiltie of the same fault, must needes bee subiect to the selfe same punishment. And therefore it followeth, that this <hi>Inquisition</hi> here spoken of, was founde out by some of the parties owne <hi>examinations:</hi> rather then by any other <hi>witnesses</hi> dwelling abroad, and therefore not able to deliuer any <hi>certeintie.</hi> But in so <hi>penall</hi> a matter, a man will hardly confesse, without torture or <hi>oathe:</hi> and <note n="3" place="margin">Hebr. 6. v. 16.</note> 
                        <hi>an oathe is for confirmation.</hi> And therefore it may happen (by the equitie of Gods lawe) that a man (in a matter <hi>criminall,</hi> and euen <hi>ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall</hi> to himselfe) may bee <hi>examined by his oathe.</hi> Howe much more then, of a <hi>crime</hi> not so penall?</p>
                     <p>That other place of the 17. of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> is left at large, without expressing, whether the partie condemned there of <hi>Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie,</hi> were to be examined vpon his owne oath, or not. Besides, in matters <hi>capitall,</hi> and where there is an <hi>Accuser</hi> (as in some sort is there) no man in this Realme vrgeth an <hi>oath.</hi> But it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilie to be gathered, that at least the <hi>partie</hi> conuented, did an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere the <hi>Accusation,</hi> or <hi>Inquisition</hi> there, by deniall, before the <hi>witnesses</hi> were produced: which many of this sorte of men will not doe, either the one way, or the other.</p>
                     <p>The other two places of the 30. of <hi>Numbers,</hi> and 19. of <hi>Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomie,</hi>
                        <pb n="189" facs="tcp:19125:255"/>
doe onely determine; that no man shalbe condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpon one witnesses deposition onely: and do make nothing to prooue either off, or on; whether a <hi>partie</hi> may be <hi>examined by oath,</hi> where witnesses may be had, or not had? except they minde to gather it thus: there be mentioned onely depositions of <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses,</hi> to the <hi>conuiction</hi> of a matter: therefore no course besides, or in any other fourme, may be vsed. But this cannot be; for though the partie denie it, (yea with oath) yet <hi>vpon two wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, shall the matter be established.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if such collection were consequent vpon these two pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; then albeit a man woulde willingly <hi>confesse</hi> the matter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst himselfe, he might not be cast and conuicted, till <hi>witnesses</hi> also should depose no lesse. But this is absurd; in that <hi>nullae sunt partes Iudicis in confessum, nisi vt ferat sententiam:</hi> and in the <hi>Gospell, ex ore tuo teipsum iudico.</hi> Besides this, the condemnation by <hi>Iuries,</hi> were then quite to bee condemned, for vngodly. For they may giue <hi>verdict</hi> sometimes but vpon one <hi>witnesses</hi> testimonie, and sometime without any; vpon violent, and strong <hi>presumptions</hi> onely, which <hi>(in hidden crimes)</hi> are good proofes. Neither are they of the <hi>Iurie</hi> to bee accounted as <hi>wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses;</hi> but are as a kinde of <hi>Iudges of the fact.</hi> Therefore in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> it is called <hi>Iudicium per pares,</hi> and they much resemble <hi>Pedanei Iudices,</hi> or <hi>Recuperatores</hi> in the <hi>Ciuill</hi> lawe, and <hi>pares Curiae</hi> in the <hi>Feudall</hi> lawe, which is practised (chiefly) in <hi>Italie, Germanie,</hi> and <hi>France.</hi>

                     <p>Euery action of <hi>Christ is for our instruction</hi> saith <hi>S.

                     <p>When <note n="1" place="margin">Matth. 26. v. 62, 63, &amp; 64.</note> 
                        <hi>Iesus</hi> was falsly charged by vntrue witnesses, hee answered nothing, though hee were vrged greatly thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to by the <hi>Priest,</hi> but helde his peace. And of holding our peace in like case, <hi>Origen</hi> 
                        <note n="2" place="margin">Origen. tract. 35 in Matth.</note> thus speaketh: <hi>to what purpose is it, to gainesay those, who gainesay and ouerthrowe themselues, by their owne contrarieties: especially seeing it is more worthie, freely and resolutely to bee silent; then to stand in defence to no purpose: for so shall not false, and lewde witnesses insult ouer vs?</hi> Yet when the <hi>Priest</hi> presently thereupon, <hi>adiured him by the liuing God, to tell them if he were the Christ, the sonne of God:</hi> he made them an answere; albeit in his <hi>diuine</hi> wisedome he knewe, that they meant to make it <hi>capitall</hi> vnto him. Nowe, shall wee hereupon gather that whensoeuer our wordes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>Iudge,</hi> bee <hi>calumniously</hi> detorted by false <hi>witnesses,</hi> to our great danger; and wee vrged: by him to make answere, that wee are therefore bound <hi>to hold our peace?</hi>

                     <p>When <hi>Saint Iohn Baptist</hi> was <note n="3" place="margin">Ioan. 1. v. 19. &amp; 20.</note> asked by the <hi>Priestes</hi> and <hi>Leuites,</hi> a dangerous question, such as if hee had beene (as they seemed to doubt) the <hi>Messiah;</hi> might haue turned him to great daunger: viz: <hi>what hee was: hee confessed, and denied not, but sayde plainely, I am not Christ.</hi> So that wee see, such a <hi>generall</hi> doctrine as they gather, may not be collected out of the former answere of our <hi>Sauiour.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Wee are therefore to knowe, that the answere was very apposite and fitte vnto: the question, which was infinite, and <hi>generall,</hi> touching his doctrine. which no man (otherwise then in generalitie) can answere, and therefore the answere was correspondent to the question. For it was, as if he had sayde thus vnto them: you aske mee of the whole <hi>doctrine</hi> by mee taught, this is impossible for mee to answere, and to recount vp vnto you. If you thinke any thing therein (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly) to bee <hi>erroneous,</hi> or <hi>seditious;</hi> enfourme your selues by those that haue heard mee, and then what you shall so obiect, I will bee ready to answere. This you may easily doe: for that which I haue taught, I haue done it <hi>publikely in the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:19125:256"/>
Temple,</hi> and in <hi>Synagogues,</hi> and not in corners. so that you shall not neede to make mee take vpon mee, such an endlesse, and impossible worke, as you might haue iust oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to doe, and to make mee yeelde account, if my <hi>teaching had beene in secrete.</hi> Whereupon thus I gather against them: if <hi>Christ</hi> being willed to giue an account of his whole course of <hi>doctrine,</hi> did therefore refuse, because it was too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall a question to bee answered, and also because it was in publike places onely deliuered by him, (so that they might easily first enfourme themselues what they tooke to be amisse, and worthie to bee obiected against him) in somuch, as <hi>hee had sayde nothing in secrete;</hi> which if hee had, might haue giuen (in trueth) iust cause vnto them to <hi>examine</hi> himselfe, what poyntes they were, that hee so carefully did auoyde the light to teach them in: then these men, that bee asked not of their <hi>doctrine in generall,</hi> but of their particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this and that poynt, in this place, at that time, done not publikely, but (of set purpose) so couertly, as might bee, so that no <hi>witnesses</hi> (but such as bee also <hi>parties)</hi> can bee had: haue no iust defence nor colour of it, out of this place. And therefore of such <hi>hidden crimes</hi> (by their owne position) they ought to answere by their oathes.</p>
                     <p>Besides, <hi>Christ</hi> was not detected (afore) of any particular matter, wherewith they might charge him: neither if he had beene, was it his principall purpose (otherwise then that hee would leaue testimonie, that hee died an innocent) to stand to cleare, and excuse himselfe particularly; that the <hi>determinate Counsell of God,</hi> might take place with him.</p>
                     <p>By the premisses may appeare, that the three reasons which they bring, to prooue this maner of question, and <hi>Inquisition,</hi> mooued by the <hi>Priest,</hi> to bee vnlawfull; are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together needelesse, seeing no man defendeth the like. But for proofe either of that more <hi>generall position,</hi> viz. <hi>where wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses may bee had, a partie may not be examined:</hi> or of the more <hi>particular,</hi> viz. <hi>that a Preacher may not be asked of any poynts of his doctrine, by him publikely deliuered:</hi> neither doth this example of <hi>Christ,</hi> nor the places which they bring, and are here <note n="1" place="margin">1.

                        </gap>, allow it not. If it were meant of the first enterteining of an <hi>accusation,</hi> then these inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would follow. that the <hi>accuser</hi> who at his owne perill <hi>debet venire paratus,</hi> should (by the very receiuing or reiecting of it) knowe afore hand; what his witnesses haue deposed, or can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose. Secondly, that witnesses might bee examined to a mans preiudice, <hi>parte rea non citata,</hi> or els that they must be twise exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; once before the <hi>accused</hi> doe appeare, and once after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. which is a needelesse trouble, where processe <hi>informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue</hi> is not vsed.</p>
                     <p>Besides, those men (that clayme it) are proceeded with, not <hi>per viam</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>. <hi>of accusation,</hi> as <hi>Saint Paul</hi> there speaketh, but by way of <hi>Enquirie.</hi> And yet there be witnesses (in sorte) of their crimes, before the accusation be receiued. For if vpon the <hi>fame</hi> they bee called, then a <hi>multitude</hi> (as it were) testifieth against them. if vpon <hi>Iudicia,</hi> Euidences, or <hi>presumptions,</hi> the like is to be said: because these <hi>are equiualent vnto a fame,</hi> as hath beene touched before. And to satisfie them the more herein, the lawe requireth not vpon an <hi>accusation;</hi> that the partie should be <hi>exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined vpon his oath,</hi> touching the <hi>crime.</hi> But they (because they will be wayward, and ouerth wart in all things) pretend it to be lawfull in a court <hi>ecclesiasticall,</hi> for a man (when there is a prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor, as in the <hi>Starchamber)</hi> to be put vnto his oath, for the trueth of the very <hi>crime:</hi> but not when it is <hi>ex officio Iudicis.</hi> which, if the law <hi>ecclesiasticall,</hi> would warrant; the <hi>Iudges</hi> thereof might soone haue the <hi>oathes</hi> of these men, by their owne <hi>position,</hi> and graunt. For who knoweth not, how easie it were to enioyne any <hi>officer</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> or one of the <hi>Commissioners</hi> friends, or
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:19125:257"/>
seruants; to preferre the matter, and to stand forth (as they terme it) <hi>an accuser?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The two places remaining out of the 22. of <hi>Exodus,</hi> &amp; the 5. of <hi>Numbers,</hi> I haue touched in the eleuenth chapter afore. shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, how they prooue, that a man may be examined vpon his owne oath, in a <hi>criminall</hi> cause, though there be no <hi>witnesse,</hi> but a bare suspition of the aduerse <hi>partie.</hi> But that a man may in no other case besides, be examined, where (perhaps) <hi>witnesse</hi> may be had (which is their purpose in this place) there is no colour, nor shadowe in either of them: execpt they haue learned to reason out of euery single place of Scripture, both <hi>affirmatiuely</hi> and <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatiuely</hi> thus, viz. <hi>This may be done in that case: and therefore, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else may be done.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the proofe of that second position, viz. that <hi>if a Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate doe require a Preacher to answere vpon his oath, touching any doctrine by him publikely deliuered, he may without breach of his due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, lawfully refuse to sweare:</hi> I doe see nothing further by them brought, that is worthie the answering. For whereas <hi>Caluin,</hi> and other <hi>Diuines</hi> say, that the vse of <hi>oathes</hi> is vpon <hi>necessitie,</hi> and for matters <hi>hidden:</hi> it is not meant by <hi>hidden,</hi> that an oath cannot lawfully be giuen, where <hi>witnesses</hi> may be had: but where the thing is neither <hi>notoriously</hi> apparant, nor <hi>confessed</hi> by the partie. For so long is it <hi>hidden</hi> to the <hi>Iudge</hi> who must proceede <hi>secundum allegata, &amp; probata.</hi> otherwise, it would folow hereof, that an oath might not be giuen to a witnesse, because the matter is knowen, and not hidden vnto him. And for the <hi>necessarie</hi> cause of giuing it; what can be more necessarie, then the discouery &amp; suppressing of <hi>sinnes,</hi> and offences, both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common wealth?</hi> But these mens griefe is, that themselues are not made the <hi>Iudges;</hi> whether the things they are to be examined of, be necessarie, and of importance to be declared. All that is spoken of the conuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>S. Paul</hi> before seuerall <hi>Magistrates,</hi> in the <note n="1" place="margin">Act. capitibus 24, 25, 26.</note> 
                        <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> is spoken vnto afore, and no way fits this purpose. For where there be accusers, there the <hi>parties</hi> oath, is not required. And yet <hi>S. Paul</hi> there, doth answer particularly; confessing som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and denying other some, of <hi>doctrine,</hi> and actions obiected.

Now whereas they say, that <hi>to remooue euill from the land,</hi> they will sweare (though the sinne be <hi>secret)</hi> but restreine it thus: <hi>so it be not to drawe matter of accusation and conuiction against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, out of their confession:</hi> it is (in effect) as if they had sayd, that in whatsoeuer cause <hi>criminall,</hi> and penal to themselues, they wil take none oath at all. except they meane that <hi>mala quia pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibita,</hi> be no such <hi>euils,</hi> as are to be discouered or <hi>remooued at all from the land.</hi> And according vnto this interpretation; their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen reasons (being all that I haue hitherto happened of) doe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distinctly tend. First, they say, it is an approued <hi>maxima</hi> of the lawe: <hi>Nemo tenetur seipsum accusare vel prodere; siue propriam tur pitudinem reuelare.</hi> But I haue <note n="1" place="margin">Cap. 9. 3. part.</note> shewed afore by true distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (out of the same law, whence this is drawen) that it is to bee vnderstood in crimes <hi>simply secret,</hi> and which are no way disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, or come to light. For when those that were <hi>secret</hi> afore, by some of those wayes (that doe open a way to an <hi>enquirie,</hi> of a person supposed <hi>criminous)</hi> are come abroad, and so (in some sorte) are manifested: then those former rules, and that of <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sostome,</hi> 
                        <note n="2" place="margin">Chrys. hom. 31. ad Hebraeos.</note> 
                        <hi>Non tibi dico vt te prodas in publicum, neque apud alium accuses,</hi> hath no further place. for then the law saith; <hi>Sic proditus, tenetur seipsum ostendere, &amp; suam innocentiam purgare.</hi> and this is for auoyding of <hi>scandall,</hi> and that the partie may be reformed.</p>
                     <p>Therefore doth <hi>Aquinas</hi> himselfe very grauely resolue thus: <note n="3" place="margin">Thom. 2. 2.</note> 
                        <hi>Cum quis</hi> (saith he) <hi>secundum ordinem iuris, à iudice interrogatur, non ipse se prodit, sed ab alio proditur: dum ei necessitas respondendi imponitur per eum, cui obedire tenetur.</hi> And againe, very pertinent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this purpose, of giuing &amp; taking an oath: <hi>Quicunque facit contra debitum iustitiae, peccat: sed pertinet ad debitum iustitiae, vt quis suo superiori obediat in ijs, quae exigit, secundum formam Iuris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This distinction of the said rule, is strongly confirmed by that, which is alledged of the <hi>oath</hi> of <hi>Ielousie,</hi> and of him which is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positarius</hi> in the law of God, handled in the eleuenth Chapter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

                     <p>Their other sixe reasons to this purpose (I assure you) I doe blush (in their behalfe) once to mention them: they are so childish, so vaine, and flashie. the very rehearsing of them doth carie a sufficient confutation, and answere on his backe: as that, <hi>he which is put to this oath, is bound to prooue a Negatiue, against law:</hi> that <hi>it doth peruert the ende of the Ciuill lawe, which is to be safe:</hi> belike, they meane the last law of the <hi>twelue tables: Salus reipub. suprema lex esto.</hi> that <hi>it transferreth the glorie of God vnto man, by searching mens consciences:</hi> that <hi>it is contrary to the equitie of Gods lawe, in that witnesses should stand forth, and not he accuse himselfe.</hi> this is <hi>coincident</hi> with the first of the seuen. that <hi>it is of the nature of auricular confession:</hi> that <hi>it is a nowrisher of sclanderous persons, because not the sclanderer, but the partie accused, must take his oath.</hi> If the reasons hereupon to be framed were to be put into forme of <hi>Syllogismes;</hi> then these propositions must be vsed for <hi>assump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> but they are not onely very vntrue, and to bee denied; but are not at all prooued by their <hi>Prosyllogismes,</hi> or reasons; which are ioyned vnto them; to vpholde, and vnderproppe them.</p>
                     <p>So that to conclude this maine poynt of <hi>ministring oath</hi> to a <hi>defendant</hi> touching his owne <hi>crime</hi> or <hi>offence:</hi> these their foure opinions against this kinde of <hi>oath</hi> are neither reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; nor their, or any others reasons vsed against it, are of any force or weight; and therefore, though no further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation had beene vsed by vs; such oath would haue beene <hi>iustifiable:</hi> which is nowe (as you haue heard) otherwise also manifoldly approoued.</p>

This their <hi>challenge</hi> is made, in this respect: for that it is sought (they say) by vertue of their oath, to <hi>draw out</hi> of them, such their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threns actions; as albeit the <hi>lawes of the Realme,</hi> and those who are their <hi>Iudges,</hi> doe holde to be <hi>crimes,</hi> and offences, and minde to punish them in that qualitie; yet they who are to be <hi>exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,</hi> are perswaded; that they are well, and commendably done, whether by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, or any other their brethren.

But the absurdities, and inconsequence of this opinion; I haue some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what also (by occasion) touched, in the 13. Chapter of this part.</p>
                     <p>Howsoeuer it is now newly taken vp, and an opinion, which they greatly please themselues in: yet did the Fathers in the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church</hi> condemne it for erroneous, and the practise of it, as vngodly. <hi>Both are</hi>

                     <p>It is <note n="2" place="margin">Alex. ab Alex. Gen. Dierum.

                     <p>Touching their reasons, I make this to be the first, as most <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral: viz. Because they haue not iustly incurred the</hi> Magistrates <hi>displeasure by any offence, therfore they cannot hold themselues bound in conscience, to be the Magistrates iustruments against such; as be none offendours.</hi> To which may be added, that <hi>they are bound to seeke rather the deliuerance of the Innocent, because it is said:</hi> 
                        <note n="3" place="margin">Prouerb. 24. ver. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer them that are drawen to death: and wilt thou not preserue them, that are led to be slaine?</hi> And it is noted as a sinne in <hi>S. Paul him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that he</hi> 
                        <note n="4" place="margin">Actes 22. v. 20.</note> 
                        <hi>stoode by, consented to Steuens death, and kept the clothes of them that slue him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As if they should say, We haue gone (in this matter) as farre as our brethren; we know our course to be good, whatsoeuer the lawes or the <hi>Magistrates</hi> determine or thinke to the contrary;
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:19125:262"/>
that doe but seeke to punish vs for it. And seeing we are so well perswaded of all our <hi>innocencies,</hi> we may not be any <hi>instruments</hi> of our owne or their further detection: for this were to consent, to haue guiltlesse men punished. But is not this to take vpon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (being but <hi>witnesses</hi> of the fact) to iudge also, of the lawe, what it ought to be, and to condemne it as it is? and is it not (in effect) asmuch, as to condemne the <hi>lawes</hi> of <hi>vniustice,</hi> and the <hi>magistrats</hi> of <hi>tyrannie, persecution,</hi> and of seeking the vexation of <hi>innocents?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But if the lawes were such, yet (at the commandement of the <hi>magistrate)</hi> to tell the particulars of these their actions, so iustifia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (as they thinke) whereof the <hi>Magistrates</hi> already knowe the generalitie; is not to consent, vnto the punishment of innocents. Doth euery one that confesseth his owne crime, &amp; <hi>pleadeth guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> in a cause <hi>capitall,</hi> consent to his owne death, or is thereby <hi>gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie</hi> of his owne blood? then why is he more consenting or guiltie to their punishing (due by lawe for these actions) who onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth them truely as they are; more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he that <hi>confesseth</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in deed guiltie) may be said to be <hi>guiltie</hi> of his owne death? It is a subiects dutie (most especially in causes not <hi>capital</hi> to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe) if he be required by authoritie; not to dallie, nor to lie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> but to tell the fact truely as it was; whomsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer besides, it may concerne. Now, if thereupon, either the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate</hi> punish it where he ought not, or more grieuously then law permitteth; or if the lawe punish that as a <hi>crime,</hi> which is a <hi>vertue</hi> the fault and guilt before God is not in them that declare the trueth, but either in the <hi>Iudges,</hi> or in the <hi>lawe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Nay, to enforce this point a little further; I would aske this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of euery of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that be of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> side: A man being of necessitie to plead either <hi>guiltie,</hi> or <hi>not guiltie</hi> to a <hi>crime capital</hi> vnto him, or els to be pressed to death; if he be guiltie of the fact, and yet (hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely) he knoweth there can be no pregnant (no nor any likely) euidence brought against him: whether <hi>in foro conscientiae,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any sinne, may such a man pleade not <hi>guiltie</hi> vnto the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of inditement? for the <hi>time, place,</hi> and other <hi>wordes of fourme and course,</hi> are not trauersable. on the other side, if (in this case) hee pleade <hi>guiltie</hi> (being so in deede) whether is he (thereby) guiltie of his owne death, or not?</p>
                     <p>But if for auoyding of sinne before God, such one ought (in conscience) to plead <hi>guiltie,</hi> rather then lye<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; and yet shall not
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:19125:262"/>
(thereby) be made guiltie of his owne death: why shall y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the trueth,</hi> touching other mens actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, make him y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth it (being charged thereunto) guiltie or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>senting vnto their punishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, how vniust soeuer (otherwise) they might be surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to be? for if any mans faults may be spared, a man might most lawfully spare himselfe: <hi>quia Ordinaria charitas incipit à seipsa.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And to presse this reason <hi>(à Paribus</hi> at least, if not <hi>à fortiori)</hi> a little further: If such a man shoulde chuse rather to be pressed to death for standing wilfully mute, and not answering directly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to either; should he not <hi>de iure poli</hi> (euen in true termes of <hi>Diuini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie)</hi> be accounted guiltie of his owne death, &amp; to be (in the sight of God) a <hi>murderer</hi> of himselfe? the very like therefore is to bee iudged of these persons, viz. that their <hi>punishment</hi> (as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uicted of the <hi>crime)</hi> is most iust; that their blood is vpon their owne heads; &amp; that none are causes of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> punishment inflicted vpon them, but themselues; for standing obstinately <hi>mute,</hi> without direct answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring (in fourme of lawe) as they ought: though it were admitted, that such their actions, whereof they bee interrogated, were all good, and they innocents.</p>
                     <p>And as the reuealing of other mens actions (when we are du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged) maketh vs not guiltie, or consenting to their punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: so our refusing to answere, neither is any meanes (in deed) nor yet is so appointed of God, to serue for their deliuera<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. For God wil not allowe to haue <hi>innocents</hi> deliuered, by our <hi>disobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> to his <hi>Lieutena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts</hi> on earth; nor by concealeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of any trueth, expedient to be knowen, &amp; (according to law) commanded to be declared. And therefore y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place of the <hi>Prouerbes</hi> by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> brought, fitteth not this purpose. For if they for their <hi>obedience</hi> sake, with a single heart &amp; without intent to hurt the <hi>innocent,</hi> and being charged; shall deliuer but the very plaine trueth (how vniustly soeuer the <hi>magistrate</hi> may seeme to deale afterward) yet shal not the discouerer of the trueth, bee a partaker of the <hi>magistrates</hi> sinne. For it is but <hi>he</hi>

But hee (willingly) as one forwarde
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:19125:263"/>
of himselfe and of a malice against the very profession (which he then detested) did thrust himselfe into the cause, and rather then he would not be some stickler in it; he thought good to do some <hi>office of kindenes</hi> vnto the torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ters &amp; executioners of that holy <hi>Martyr,</hi> though it were but by keeping their clothes: &amp; thereby he directly, gaue approbation and consent, vnto <hi>Steuens</hi> death. Yea, this their opinion is without any other like example in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny text of <hi>Scripture;</hi> except perhappes they will gather it from an <hi>obseruation</hi> and note pretended to be collected from the next Chapter following. For I finde an opinion collected thence, which iumpeth with theirs, in this behalfe. <note n="1" place="margin">Rhemish Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in annotat. cap. 23. Act. A. post. ver. 12.</note> 
                        <hi>If thou bee put to an oathe</hi> (saith that note) <hi>to accuse Catholikes for seruing God as they ought to doe; or to vtter any innocent man vnto Gods enemies and his: thou oughtest first to refuse such vnlawfull oathes. But if thou haue not constancie and courage so to doe, yet knowe thou that such oathes binde not at all in conscience, and lawe of God: but may and must be broken, vnder paine of damnation.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They will not confesse, that they haue sucked this opinion from hence: and they may not be endured to flappe vs out with <note place="margin">T. C.</note> their olde dogge tricke; and to say <hi>they borrowed it not of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes, but obserued so much themselues, by reading of the Bible.</hi> For this were both to iustifie their owne; and with-all, this corrupt doctrine of the <hi>Iesuites,</hi> as if they both (so well agreeing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) were arightly grounded vpon the <hi>worde of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But they bring seuerall places and examples, whereby they thinke this is prooued. The <hi>officers</hi> of the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> that were appointed by <hi>Pharaohs</hi> taske-masters, to looke; that the people shoulde make as much Bricke by day (and gather the strawe themselues) as they did when strawe was found to their handes; seeing that the people were not able to perfourme it, and yet were beaten for not doing it; did signifie the impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie &amp; vnreasonablenes of this, vnto the <hi>king.</hi> But the king gaue them a resolute answere; that they shoulde doe it; vpbraiding them, that it was but idlenesse, which made them pretend, that they would goe to offer sacrifice vnto their God. Which thing was the ground of <hi>Moyses</hi> and <hi>Aarons</hi> suite vnto him, that the people might haue leaue, to goe into the wildernesse. So when these <hi>officers</hi> comming with this hard answere from the king; did

meete with <hi>Moyses</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> they expostulated thus with them: <hi>Ye</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>But what is this to purpose? doth this phrase <hi>of putting a sword into another mans hand</hi> so please these men, that they will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine; by what occasion soeuer a wicked man pickes quarell to oppresse Gods children; that such a thing whereupon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion is taken (of necessitie) is vnlawfull to be done? from the best actions of godly men, tyrants will oftentimes take occasion, to persecute the whole Church. shall therefore all exercises of religion be intermitted?</p>
                     <p>Euen in this place, the message that <hi>Moyses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> brought to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (which occasioned such oppression to the children of <hi>Israel)</hi> was put in their mouthes by the Lord. And therefore they sinned not, albeit this was like to haue turned to be <hi>as a sword,</hi> to destroy vp all the children of <hi>Israel:</hi> but rather these <hi>officers</hi> did offend, that thus did mutine and grudge against those, who fulfilled <hi>Gods co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement,</hi> and did but as they ought to do. Euen so shall they offend likewise, that shall be displeased with such, as doe what they are lawfully commanded; albeit trouble and punishment by that occasion shal happen vnto them, that so take offence.

Moreouer the killing of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> for no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or colour of cause at all; is in it selfe so apparant an <hi>euill,</hi> as no man can haue any shadow, to giue a lawfull consent vnto it. Lastly, a man cannot gather a <hi>generall doctrine</hi> (in a matter doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and not plainely deliuered els where in <hi>Scripture)</hi> out of any particular mans fact: because all the circumstances which then fell out, are not knowen. But most especially, an <hi>example</hi> can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer serue to the ouerthrow of the generall commandement, <hi>of obeying the Magistrate.</hi> And, <hi>viuendum est legibus, non exemplis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Out of the first booke of <hi>Samuel,</hi> they bring three other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. <note place="margin">1. Sam. 19. ver. 1. 2.</note> The first, that <hi>Saul spake to Ionathan his sonne and to all his seruants, that they should kill Dauid: but Ionathan Sauls sonne, had a great fauour vnto Dauid, and bade him take heede</hi> &amp;c. The second, <hi>when Saul said to Ionathan: Send and fetch Dauid vnto</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1. Sam. 20. ver. 31. &amp; 32.</note> 
                        <hi>me, for he shall surely die: Ionathan answered, Wherefore shall hee die? What hath he done?</hi> the third, that <hi>when Saul commanded his seruants to fall vpon the Priests of the Lord, &amp; to slay them; they would</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">1. Sam. 22. ver. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>not moue their hands, to fall vpon the Priests of the Lord.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To these three, one answere may serue, and therfore they are thus set together. First, these commandements (though of the <hi>king)</hi> yet they were, when he was enraged and in a furie; after the Lord was departed from him, &amp; an euil spirit was come vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. Againe, it is apparantly vngodly in it self for any to kill an <hi>Innocent,</hi> vpon the tyrannous and vnaduised commandement of the <hi>king;</hi> euen without all colour of any lawful <hi>Iudiciall</hi> course. Lastly, <hi>Dauid</hi> was knowen vnto them, to be afore appoynted, yea, &amp; their <hi>annointed</hi> king from the Lord; howsoeuer <hi>Saul</hi> was tolerated <hi>de facto</hi> to continue in place: till the measure of his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie was fulfilled. And therfore (in this respect) was it vnlawful to kil, either him, or those that fauoured him; especially the <hi>Lords Priests:</hi> whose <hi>linnen Ephod</hi> should be a protection vnto them, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">Ibid. ver. 18.</note> al such precipitate executions: where neither conisance of their cause, nor any due <hi>conuiction and iudgement,</hi> was precedent.</p>
                     <p>Another example they bring, of the mid wiues of the <hi>Israelites,</hi>
                        <pb n="207" facs="tcp:19125:264"/>
to proue their intention. It is thus written, <hi>they feared God, and did</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Exod. 1. ver. 17.</note> 
                        <hi>not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but preserued (aliue) the men children.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This obiection carrieth his answere with him. For it is said, <hi>they feared God, &amp; therefore did not herein, as the king co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded:</hi> noting vnto vs, that the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement was such, as could no way stand with the <hi>feare of God.</hi> There is no <hi>Prince</hi> in the world to bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed, when he commaundeth any thing directly forbidden by God: for <hi>it is better to obey God then man.</hi> The Prince is no <hi>God,</hi> nor yet Gods Lieutenant, but a meere man; in that which he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandeth directly contrary to God. That this was of that kinde, it appeareth: for <hi>to kil,</hi> is (manifestly) by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                        <hi>moral</hi> law of <hi>God</hi> &amp; <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> forbidden. Yet this hath his exception: viz. that it is no <hi>mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> when we execute the penaltie of lawe, vpon murderers &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wicked persons, duely conuicted &amp; condemned. For <hi>he that</hi> 
                        <note place="margin">Gene. 9. ver. 6.</note> 
                        <hi>sheddeth mans blood, his blood shall be shed by man,</hi> saith the Lord. But there could be no colour or apparance of any <hi>actual</hi> wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse in children newly borne, why they should be executed: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but by a generall iudgement condemned most wickedly and tyrannously; euen before they were. <hi>non censetur existere</hi> (saith the law) <hi>qui adhuc est in vtero matris.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now let vs compare these last foure examples, with the scope and purpose, for which they are vsed. The very act of <hi>murdering</hi> a person notoriously <hi>innocent,</hi> in that he is neither <hi>conuicted,</hi> nor condemned, is <hi>malumper se:</hi> a thing simply and absolutely in his owne nature <hi>euill,</hi> without any further circumstance. But to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what a man knoweth to be done by another; the very <hi>au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours</hi> themselues of this opinion, must needes confesse to bee sometimes lawfull and requisit: and therefore they must at least graunt it to be <hi>medius Actus:</hi> such as (by circumstance) may be lawfull; howsoeuer by the circumstances of this case (as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded) they will (perhaps) hold it vnlawfull. And therefore there is such dissimilitude and diuersitie betwixt these examples, and that which they holde; as they can neuer serue this purpose.</p>
                     <p>Therefore to fit their turne, in the very poynt of the issue, they must proue vnto vs: that it is vngodly, for any man (though char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by <hi>lawfull authoritie)</hi> to declare his knowledge of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans actions; if hee that is vrged so to make declaration,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:19125:265"/>
doe iudge afore-hand; that the <hi>Magistrate</hi> mindes to punish such action, either where he ought not at all, or in other sort, then <hi>Gods</hi> law permitteth.</p>
                     <p>For this purpose, they alledge as strongest, the example <note n="1" place="margin">Iosh. 2. ver. 3. &amp; 4.</note> of <hi>Rahab:</hi> who would not tell the king of <hi>Iericho,</hi> where the two spies of <hi>Israel</hi> were; though she were by him <hi>commanded to bring them foorth;</hi> and she is commended for it, by the <note n="2" place="margin">Heb. 11. ver. 31.</note> 
                        <hi>holy Ghost.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In answere hereof I say: we reade not, that the king asked her, whether they were there still, or not; albeit shee <note n="3" place="margin">Iosu. 2. ver. 5.</note> answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <hi>that they went out:</hi> but she was commanded to <hi>bring them forth;</hi> which is something more, then to tell where they were, if she had beene so asked.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, <hi>by</hi> 
                        <note n="4" place="margin">Heb. ibid. &amp; Iosu ibid. <abbr>V.</abbr> 10.</note> 
                        <hi>faith</hi> (vpon hearing the miracles that <hi>God</hi> had done, and wrought for the children of <hi>Israel)</hi> and by special reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; <hi>Rahab knew,</hi> that <hi>God,</hi> 
                        <note n="5" place="margin">Ibid. ver. 11.</note> 
                        <hi>euen the God of heauen aboue, and earth beneath,</hi> whose <hi>the earth is, and the fulnesse thereof,</hi> and who (according to his prouidence and wisedome) <hi>doth translate and establish kingdomes,</hi> as it seemeth best to his diuine pleasure: had afore that, <hi>giuen that whole</hi> 
                        <note n="6" place="margin">Iosu. Ibid. <abbr>V.</abbr> 9.</note> 
                        <hi>land, vnto the children of Israel.</hi> So that in very right and trueth, she did owe no more obedience to the late <hi>king</hi> of <hi>Iericho;</hi> but was by <hi>God</hi> discharged thereof, and lawfully might (as she did) submit her selfe, &amp; capitulate (for her safegard) with the embassadours of those; to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (of very right) her subiection then belonged, and therefore could not (without sinne) haue betraied them, being sent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>Ioshua</hi> her lawful <hi>soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne;</hi> into the hands of an <hi>vsurper;</hi> who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> she knew perfitely the Lord had deposed, &amp; <note n="7" place="margin">Ibid. ver. 13.</note> meant soone after, to destroy accordingly.</p>
                     <p>This interpretation is euidently &amp; very strongly confirmed by that place of <hi>Scripture,</hi> where she is, for this, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended. <hi>By</hi> 
                        <note n="8" place="margin">Hebr. ibid.</note> 
                        <hi>faith</hi> (saith that place) <hi>the harlot Rahab perished not</hi>

                        </gap>, <hi>with the disobedient, when she had receiued the spies peaceably.</hi> If then the rest of <hi>Iericho</hi> were <hi>disobedient</hi> (in respect of which, <hi>Rahabs</hi> obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience &amp; peaceable receiuing of them are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended) &amp; therfore they perished by the hand of <hi>Ioshua</hi> &amp; the people: is it not mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that <hi>Ioshua</hi> was their <hi>lawfull Magistrate</hi> in right, and that they ought to haue taken knowledge thereof, and to haue <hi>obeyed</hi> him, at their owne perils?</p>
                     <p>Lastly, there is in this fact something <hi>extraordinarie,</hi> as done
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:19125:265"/>
by <hi>spectall oeconomy,</hi> which, by vs may not safely be followed. As the lye that shee made, in <note n="1" place="margin">Ios. 2. v. 4. &amp; 5.</note> saying, <hi>shee wist not whence they were, and that they went out in the euening.</hi> And likewise, it is not to be presumed by any <hi>subiects</hi> in these dayes (when as miraculous, and <hi>speciall reuelations</hi> are ceased) to adiudge themselues either wholly, or in some particular actions &amp; circumstances, to stand discharged of their <hi>obedience</hi> and <hi>alegeance</hi> towards their <hi>Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne</hi> or <hi>vndermagistrates;</hi> when, and how farre, themselues wil fansie. For if by this and such like <hi>extraordinarie</hi> examples (or by that of <hi>Obadiahs</hi> hiding of the hundred <hi>Prophets)</hi> such presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were lawfull or tolerable: what a goodly colour might all disobedient and rebellious subiects haue, namely vnnatural <hi>fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiues</hi> ouer sea, <hi>Iesuites, Seminarimen, recusants, concealers</hi> &amp; <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berours</hi> of these, and such like boutifeux &amp; bellowes of sedition, for all their godlesse attempts? are they not, or at least will they not pretend, to be as assured and resolute of the goodnes of their cause, as the <hi>Disciplinarians</hi> are touching theirs, &amp; their designe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? so that for these men, that would be counted most sincere <hi>professors of the Gospel,</hi> to holde the like dangerous <hi>positions,</hi> &amp; to seeke to confirme them, with the same &amp; no better reasons and examples then the <hi>Papists</hi> doe theirs: for my part, I doe recken it to be the practise and part, neither of grounded and iudicious <hi>Diuines,</hi> nor of well aduised or duetifull subiects, <hi>quorum vesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gijs insistunt, eorundem exitus perhorrescant.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But they say further: that by such oath, <hi>they should be drawen to discouer vnaduised speeches, that sometimes passe men in priuate fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship, as at table &amp;c. or such as come vnto them for counsell, and for priuate resolution of their consciences.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>First, there is no man bound to answere more matters then be conteined in the <hi>Article</hi> or <hi>Interrogatorie,</hi> whereof he is <hi>exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</hi> But if any matter be therein layde downe in such sort, as it leadeth (pertinently &amp; directly) to such discouerie: then is it likely, that by some meanes it is <hi>detected</hi> vnto the <hi>Magistrate</hi> afore, and by him thought expedient (for some necessarie pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like cause) worthy of such <hi>Enquirie.</hi> Againe, if such priuate <hi>talke</hi> or <hi>asking of counsell</hi> haue bene co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning some platte or practise laid or to be laide, that shall (in discretion) be adiudged by the <hi>Magistrate</hi> expedient (for the common wealths sake) to bee
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:19125:266"/>
knowen and discouered; and therefore if they shall <hi>enquire</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly of it: I can not see, howe it may stand with any mans du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to <hi>God,</hi> vnto the <hi>Prince,</hi> vnto <hi>Lawes,</hi> &amp; to the <hi>Common wealth</hi> to conceale it, being charged to the contrary. But of other se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret speeches, treaties, and resolutions of mens <hi>consciences;</hi> no <hi>Magistrate</hi> is of so slender <hi>discretion,</hi> as to <hi>enquire;</hi> nor can by lawe (though hee would) for want of those <hi>indicia</hi> and speciall <hi>presumptions</hi> and inducements that are required, to ground an <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie</hi> vpon: and therefore this is but matter deuised, <hi>ad concitan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam &amp; conflandam inuidiam,</hi> against <hi>lawfull authoritie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>They alleage also, that by their discouerie, <hi>some that be very poore may be vndone: and that the most of the matters and persons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing already knowen vnto authoritie, there can be none vse for them to appeach any, but to alienate their mutuall affections, and to haue one another in ielousie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This is very loose &amp; simple, to reason vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a <hi>casuall euent</hi> which may happen, thereby to prooue a thing vnlawfull. for of a good matter, an ill <hi>euent</hi> may, and doeth often fall out, <hi>&amp; è conuerso. Careat successibus opto, quisquis ab euentis facta nota<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>da putat,</hi> could the very <hi>heathe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Poet</hi> say. And why should a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> withdraw his duty to <hi>Magistrates,</hi> onely for particular &amp; priuate respects touching himselfe, and some few other priuate persons? Whatsoeuer may <hi>happen,</hi> let him doe as he ought: <hi>Fiat iustitia, &amp; ruat mundus.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Particularly to the first, why should any man pitie his pouertie, that pitieth not himself, but wilfully runneth into da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger of lawes? &amp; shal a man holde a poore man more deare vnto him, then the common quiet &amp; peace of the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Common wealth</hi> both?</p>
                     <p>The second part implieth a <hi>contradiction</hi> in itselfe: for if the matters and persons were sufficiently knowen; then (in trueth) were it of no vse, for the <hi>Magistrate</hi> to <hi>enquire</hi> further, yet if they be so knowen already, then what wilfulnesse is it in these men, thus obstinately to persist to their owne hurt, and yet to doe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers no good thereby?</p>
                     <p>They obiect further, that to discouer their brothers secrets, is condemned as a fault, by the <hi>Holy ghost:</hi> for <note n="1" place="margin">Prou. 11. v. 13.</note> 
                        <hi>he that goeth about as a slanderer, discouereth a secret, but he that is of a faithfull heart concealeth a matter. And seeing they haue met in some mens houses that did it for good affection and opinion vnto them; if they should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:19125:266"/>
such, it were a very vnthankefull requitall</hi> (they say) <hi>towardes them. And for that their felowship is in the trueth, &amp; the course they walke holy, therefore (euen by the law of loue and felowship) they may not detect one another: for that were a note of a false brother.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for the trueth of the matters that <hi>they meete about,</hi> &amp; the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of the course they walke,</hi> it is not of this place to discusse: how <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>true</hi> soeuer it is, it dare not looke out at noone dayes: and yet we liue in a state <hi>professing the Gospel. Num sic Apostoli? num sic Martyres, &amp;c?</hi> but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more <hi>true</hi> &amp; <hi>holy</hi> it is, the lesse ought they to be ashamed to reueile it (being called into question for it) as is signified afore. Here (we see) that the <hi>law of their loue and felowship, and ius hospitale,</hi> towards such their priuate friends, as haue receiued them; is by them, more esteemed &amp; accounted of; then either the <hi>publike lawes</hi> and <hi>statutes</hi> of the realme, or, then their duetie to the <hi>Christian</hi> Magistrate, and to their countrey, <hi>quae</hi>

                     <p>In answer whereof, I say, that this was but a fauor voluntarily offred vnto him vpon that condition; and that oath was none o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise <hi>exacted</hi> of him, nor yet by lawe might be <hi>exacted.</hi> Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as no man is (by law) bound to make any such promise, or to enter into such a course. Againe, there was no speciall opinion in particularitie charged vpon him, which he should be sworne to forsake, &amp; should detect others of; except he should be bound to forsake all that he had learned in Scripture concerning the feare &amp; seruice of God. and therefore it is nothing like vnto the case, against which, wee doe here argue. For those <hi>Innouators,</hi> which were authours of this opinion, had particular articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their owne, and others <hi>actions, treaties</hi> and <hi>conclusions</hi> obiected vnto them: which were also afore-hand conueniently (though not in euery necessarie particular) knowen, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered afore vnto the <hi>Magistrates.</hi> vnto which (albeit after many tergiuersations, and much a doe) they answered at last in the <hi>Starre-chamber</hi> vpon their oathes that which touched their owne facts only: yet vnto no more thereof would they answer, then they presupposed &amp; gathered to be afore knowen, suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for their conuiction, though they should haue concealed it. But what other company they had, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those who were defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants at that time, or in whose houses such <hi>Synodes,</hi> and <hi>treaties</hi> were held; they pretended themselues bound in conscience, not to answere. And yet the <hi>Iudges</hi> of the land, twise, or thrise ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled it, and signified so much vnder their hands; that (by lawe) they ought, and were bound, to answere the <hi>Interrogatories</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred concerning ech of their complices and partakers.</p>

                     <p>He seeketh also to ouerthrowe (howbeit but generall oathes, which none defends) by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>paring them to the doings of <hi>Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> sometimes Bishop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> against whom he most bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly inueieth, for constraining children (by oath) to accuse their parents &amp;c. of heresie: whereof some (he saieth) chose rather to bee forsworne: and bringeth Master <hi>Foxe</hi> his condemnation thereof.

                     </p>
                     <p>I can easily yeelde, that where great presumption or perill of periurie is, rather then a man wil discouer a trueth, that there, and vnto such, it is no good discretion to minister an oath. but especially against the life of those, who attaine so neere vnto vs in proximitie of blood, or other no lesse strong affection. For the <hi>ciuil</hi> law saith, <hi>Filius no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> torquetur in caput patris;</hi> a child ought not to be tortured in a point of perill, vnto his fathers life. And the like reason, which is in torture, may (by some perhaps) be thoght to be also in an oth. against his fathers life. But we may not make this a general doctrine; as if in no case whatsoeuer a childe, or such like might be examined in a point <hi>capitall</hi> to his father &amp;c. For if the matter do concerne treason against the <hi>Prince,</hi> or the common wealth; I make no doubt, but that, a man may, &amp; ought

to be tortured, euen against his <hi>natural father,</hi> and others, howe neere soeuer.

                     </p>
                     <p>The cause why this exception is by them taken, is not for that al such refusers do purpose to take the oth, when they shall haue seene the articles; but if they shall finde them to be such as they thinke either cannot be proued (in case they shal deny them) or to be of that sort, as they can easily wade through with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: then some of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (heretofore) haue not stuck, nor made any bones to take their oths, whatsoeuer they wil do now. And therfore cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> will not so much, as promise by their word to take <hi>oth,</hi> to answer the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> after perusal. So that it may appeare, this is but a quarrell picked by them, (of purpose to aduertise their <hi>compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> how far they also may be touched) rather then that there is any serious matter of scruple herein, which they stand vpon.</p>
                     <p>Some of the causes why it is not thought co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient (by those that be in <hi>authoritie)</hi> to let them always know the seueral parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularities aforehand, &amp; so to leaue it in their liberty either to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuse, or to take oath afterward to answere them; are sufficient, and weighty. One is, because it is sometimes impossible in it selfe; for that one <hi>Interrogatorie</hi> often riseth of an other, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially where a man answereth affirmatiuely: so that the oathe cannot conueniently be in ech case restrained vnto such of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as are set downe afore; seeing necessarie occasion of circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>stance

ministred, may leade vnto a further examination. Another is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (as some of them haue done when this fauour hath beene shewed) they vse it but as a meanes, to instruct their <hi>confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates</hi> for concealing, or disguising of the trueth: which may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, for that after perusall, they themselues remaine as obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in refusall, as they were before.</p>
                     <p>And albeit no lawe (that I knowe) doth of necessitie require articles to be shewed to them, at such proceeding, before they resolue, whether they will take the oathe, or not: yet if any will sweare (afore) but thus; that he will peruse them, and after hee hath perused them, he wil then take the oath, directly, and true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to answere them, so far as by law he is bound: assuredly then, the sight of them aforehand neither hath bin, nor will (I thinke) at any time hereafter be denied vnto any, in such a case.</p>
                     <p>Some reasons I haue heard to haue by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bin vsed, to proue it vngodly. It is thus written in the<hi rend="sup">1</hi> 
                        <hi>Prouerbs; He that answereth</hi>

                        <hi>a matter before he heare it, it is folly, and shame to him.</hi> Much more then (say they) is it <hi>folly,</hi> to <hi>sweare</hi> to answere a matter, before a man heare it. In very deed, it is not possible directly to <hi>answere</hi> any matter, before a man <hi>heare</hi> it, and know what it is. But the meaning of the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> there, is to taxe such; as vpon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, or for ostentation of pregnancie of wit, and quicknes of conceipt, or vpon some other rashnes; will take vpon them to vnderstand a matter and to answer to it, before halfe the tale, and materiall points of it, be opened vnto them. Whereupon grosse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (ofttimes) mistaking the whole <hi>matter;</hi> such a man is shamed, and <hi>folly</hi> is also iustly imputed vnto him for it.</p>
                     <p>Besides; this their collection hereof is out of the rule, that is in controuersie, and practise. For there are neuer any sworn to <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer a matter before they heare it.</hi> But (indeed) they take an oath (aforehand) to answer the <hi>matter</hi> truely, when they shall come to their examination: and then they do <hi>heare</hi> al the matters ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected, before they neede make <hi>answere</hi> vnto them.</p>
                     <p>The grand <hi>Enquests</hi> do take alike, yet a lawful oth; which is, that <hi>they shal diligently enquire, and truly present al offenders against any such point, as shalbe giuen vnto them in charge,</hi> which charge is giuen, after their oath is taken.</p>
                     <p>Their next reason is, that <hi>for a man to take an oth; without a sure

                     <p>Herein, the <hi>assumption</hi> is to be denied, &amp; <hi>prosyllogisme</hi> or reason, which is brought to prooue it: for it is of, and also according to euery honest mans <hi>faith,</hi> to beleeue himself bound in <hi>conscience,</hi> to obey the <hi>positiue</hi> lawes of his country (which require him to take such othe) so they be not contrary to <hi>Gods commandement.</hi>

                     <p>And albeit euery particular neither is vsed to bee, nor yet is meet, nor (indeed oft times) can be aforehand declared, which is requisit to be asked of him, as one questio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil grow of another: neuertheles, the <hi>general heads</hi> are signified &amp; opened vnto him. and it is withal declared, that he shal but answere matters of his own <hi>fact,</hi> or <hi>knowledge:</hi> that they touch neither his <hi>life, nor limme,</hi> &amp; that (if he think good) he may <hi>challenge</hi> any of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at the time of his <hi>examinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> as not being bound by law to answer them, &amp; he shal therein (if law do not bind him) be allowed to refuse.

It may be, that one of the <hi>Note-gatherers</hi> quotatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s out of <hi>Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall,</hi> was by him set downe to enforce also this point; namely where he thus writeth: <hi>If</hi>

But what is this to the refusall of oathe, when it is not <hi>generall,</hi> but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained vnto certaine <hi>articles,</hi> and points; the heads whereof are also opened afore vnto him, who is to sweare? or what serueth it, to iustifie a refusal; for that the defendant may not first peruse euery <hi>Interrogatorie</hi> particularly, before he will resolue whether he wil take the oath, or refuse it?</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Treatisor</hi> also alledgeth (to this point especially as I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) a saying of <hi>Ioh.

Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the iudgement of <hi>La<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bert,</hi> that a man is not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d (in distinctly) to bewray who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>soeuer hee knoweth to haue offended, is also al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable. For a man being so generally asked, is not bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d (by any law that I know) to take oth, to bewray whatsoeuer he knowes,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:19125:271"/>
touching al other mens faults; so they be meerely secret, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested at al abroad, nor bringing any <hi>scandal</hi> or apparant dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, either to the <hi>church</hi> or <hi>common weale,</hi> or vnto the soules of a multitude, &amp; where of he may &amp; ought (in charitie) presume; that the offendors be repentant. Thirdly, I take this iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t also to be very sound both in <hi>diuinity</hi> and <hi>law;</hi> that a man may not be vrged in any humane court, to disclose what hee thinketh <hi>in his heart:</hi> vnles by word or deed, it be come vnto some ouert <hi>Acte.</hi> For if it come so far, there may be then sundrie occasions, why a man should be examined, what he thinketh or beleeueth. As if a man wil alledge <hi>iudicially</hi> something, &amp; desire it to be admitted which ought so to be, in case he propound it <hi>bonafide,</hi> &amp; not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniously: the <hi>Iudge</hi> may here vrge him, to declare by his <hi>oth;</hi> whether he beleeueth the said matter to be true, &amp; that he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it may be prooued. Likewise, he that shall be detected to haue spoken like an <hi>Atheist;</hi> or an <hi>Heretike</hi> against <hi>God,</hi> may be examined vpon his oath touching his beleefe. neither is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wraying of himselfe herein, <hi>capitall</hi> vnto him, vnles he shall wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully persist in his error, and blasphemy. and therefore I thinke, that by the lawes and policie of this realme, it is otherwise in a person, which hath once <hi>abiured,</hi> &amp; is againe <hi>relapsed.</hi> &amp; that he ought not to be examined by oath, touching his heresies by him vttered and holden. because if he be conuinced to haue <hi>relapsed;</hi> he ought (by lawe) to be burned, notwithstanding he shall then againe pretend reuocation of his error and hearty repentance.</p>
                     <p>Out of this answere of <hi>Lamberts</hi> vnto that article; I obserue, that the <hi>Treatisour</hi> (in my copie at least) hath some what chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged these words, viz. <hi>and none could be found in me, if then they should require me, &amp;c.</hi> for insteede of <hi>if then,</hi> hee hath put these, viz. <hi>or if:</hi> because he would not haue them sound any way, as if <hi>Lambert</hi> meant, that a man might bee sworne touching the crime of <hi>fornication</hi> imputed to himselfe; albeit hee were not bound to bewray all others, whome he knewe to haue offended that way. Besides, by <hi>Lamberts</hi> said answer it appeareth, that he thought, <hi>Magistrates</hi> might cause subiects to sweare (though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their wils) &amp; that they are bound to obey them therein: which he exemplifieth by that which <hi>Salomon</hi> might haue done with the two women, which contended about the childe; if
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:19125:271"/>
otherwise he could not haue found out the trueth thereof. And he concludeth his answere to that article thus: viz. that <hi>he thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it lawfull at the commandement of a Iudge to take an oath to say the trueth: specially if the Iudge require it duely, and in lawfull wise.</hi> whereby we see <hi>Tyndals</hi> iudgement by <hi>Lambert</hi> to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled, where he writeth absolutely; that <hi>no Iudge ought to make a man sweare against his will.</hi> Lastly, <hi>Lambert</hi> there concludeth, that <hi>a Iudge may cause a man to make an oath in any other case con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient, and that also for purgation of infamie, when any infamie is lawfully laide against a man.</hi> So that the <hi>Treatisour</hi> himselfe, who condemneth all such oathes of clearing, as <hi>purgations poysonfull,</hi> for that they may <hi>induce periurie;</hi> is by this his owne allegation, (which he may notrefuse) well confuted.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Notegatherer</hi> auoucheth also three examples, where men were proceeded with, for matter of pretended <hi>heresie;</hi> and yet had a copy of the Articles deliuered vnto them. But he tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth not, whether they were afore that, or afterwarde sworne. But howsoeuer some were then thought good to be proceeded with; yet cannot this prooue, that it was holden to be vnlawfull, to doe otherwise. For I haue also knowen the like fauour vsed, vnto sundry pretending scruple in this point: who (in very deed) little deserued it: for they were neuer the neerer afterward, to make oath to answere them.</p>
                     <p>The equitie of this proceeding, yea farre aboue the lawfull practise of <hi>courts</hi> on the other side the sea, in their proceeding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst crimes (euen <hi>capitall)</hi> by the course of the <hi>Ciuil</hi> lawes may appeare; by comparing of them in some points together.</p>
                     <p>They haue there, two Processes in most <hi>criminall</hi> matters: the first is called <hi>processus informatiuus,</hi> which conteineth al the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia,</hi> or the <hi>Euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces,</hi> presumptions, &amp; sayings of those, which can testifie against the partie <hi>enquired</hi> of.

                     <p>The oath appointed by the nowe repealed statute against <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie</hi> was <hi>very generall:</hi> and yet that point, thought agreeable ynough, to equitie. for this was not any ground of the repealing of it.

Neuerthelesse, when one thing seemeth (cautelously) to bee in demaund by the <hi>Libell,</hi> and another thing (in trueth) not incident to an <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall</hi> court, is vnder hand shot at: then, and in such case only, vpon apparant probabilities thereof shewed vnto the temporall <hi>Iudges;</hi> it cannot be thought inconuenient for them to graunt a <hi>Prohibition,</hi> yea though the <hi>Libell</hi> be not viewed afore by them, nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teine expresly any matter, belonging to a temporal court.</p>

XVI.</hi> That after the partie hath answered vpon his oath, it is neither vnusu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, vnlawfull, nor vngodly; to seeke to conuince him, by witnesses, or other triall; if he be supposed, not to haue deliuered a plaine &amp; full trueth: and somewhat also in approbation of <hi>Canonicall purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> with answere to the <hi>Treatisours</hi> obiections against them.</head>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heir next exception (set out afore in this order to be spoken of,) which this sorte of men doe make vnto the maner of proceeding Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, (being of a thing ensuing after the oath and examination) is; for <hi>that Iudges Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call doe not alwayes rest in that which is affirmed or denied, vpon the parties oath: but doe oft times proceede to a further enquirie, by examination of witnesses, vpon the poynts denied by the partie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>A man might iustly maruell; what should mooue them thus to require all other men to thinke so well of their single oathes, (and especially in their owne cause) as if they had some indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie offered vnto them, onely because their owne single oathes are not perfitly beleeued; but that proofes (by witnesses) are after made to conuince them, of that, which is denied by them.</p>
                     <p>But for this they bring also some pretence (as for the rest of their opinions) out of the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> It is said in the Epistle to <note n="1" place="margin">Heb. 6. v. 16.</note> the <hi>Hebrewes:</hi> that <hi>an oath for confirmation, is amongst men, an ende of all strife.</hi> Whereupon they gather, that whatsoeuer they shall deliuer vpon their oathes, it ought to be finall &amp; perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, to conclude the cause of necessitie, without any more adoe.</p>
                     <p>The vse of the oath, which is in that place spoken of, is (especially and most properly) appliable, to two kindes of <hi>oathes.</hi> The first is an <hi>oath Promissorie,</hi> when (for more assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the promise to bee kept) the parties agree, that it shall bee taken. which thing is argued by the circumstance of the place, as being brought to prooue the certaintie of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missorie oath,</hi> which God made vnto <hi>Abraham:</hi> and also by the word of <hi>Confirmation</hi> there vsed. Secondly, this place hath vse very properly also, in an <hi>oath Decisorie:</hi> when <note n="2" place="margin">Azo. in Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma de rebus cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditis.</note> as either the one or the other of the parties is contented, to put the matter that is in variance, vpon his aduersaries owne oath:
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:19125:275"/>
which if he thereupon shall take, it maketh an end of the whole suite <hi>and strife.</hi> For in this case, he that so offered it, shall not bee permitted to vse any contrarie proofes afterwards: because hee made choise to haue the whole cause in variance betwixt them, composed in that forte.</p>
                     <p>It may also truely be answered to that place, that an oath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely taken; is (in deede) a meanes prouided, and tending to make ende of all strifes amongst men: but not that in euery cause and matter whatsoeuer, one mans single oath should ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be sufficient. because many absurdities would follow of such an interpretation. as namely, that a mans oath in his owne cause, should be as good and forcible; as any other two mens oathes touching the same matter. But the law saith: <hi>dictum vnius, dictum nullius.</hi> One <hi>singular deposition,</hi> though of a witnesse (who is not interessed in the cause, and therefore the more indifferent) is not to be taken for a full proofe. Then howe much lesse should the parties oath (whom the lawe presumes to be partiall in his owne cause) be admitted for a concludent proofe, especially to his owne <hi>clearing</hi> or benefite?</p>
                     <p>Besides, if such their interpretation of that place should be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; then were this place co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary, to sundry other places in the Scripture; which <hi>is blasphemie</hi> to imagine. For <note n="1" place="margin">Num. 35. v. 30.</note> 
                        <hi>one witnesse shall not testifie against a person to cause him to die, but witnesses,</hi> therfore moe then one. And by consequence, a mans owne witnesse (in his owne behalfe) is not sufficient. <hi>At the</hi>

                        <hi>mouth of two or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death, die: but at the mouth of one witnesse, he shall not die.</hi> Againe: <note n="3" place="margin">Deut. 19. v. 15.</note> 
                        <hi>One witnesse shall not rise against a man for any trespasse, or for any sinne, or for any fault that he offendeth in: but at the mouth of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shal euery word be established.</hi> 
                        <note n="4" place="margin">Matt. 18. v. 16.</note> Like-wise in the <hi>Gospell: by the mouth of two or three witnesses, euery word may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed.</hi> Furthermore, <hi>it is</hi>

himselfe, and for his owne benefite or clearing, be receiued for an vndoubted trueth. The blinde <hi>Pharisees</hi> could see so much; that it was absurd, for any sinfull man to arrogate so much to himselfe, that his owne witnesse touching himselfe, should suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Therefore they say <note n="1" place="margin">Ioan. 8. v. 13.</note> to <hi>Christ,</hi> whom they tooke to be but man onely; <hi>thou bearest record of thy selfe, thy record is not true.</hi> And <hi>Christ</hi> himselfe signifieth the like, for he saith: <note n="2" place="margin">Ioan. 5. v. 31.</note> 
                        <hi>If I shoulde beare witnesse of my selfe, my witnesse were not true.</hi> meaning, that where there is no further <hi>testimonie</hi> for a man, then his owne: there is nosufficient cause, that other men shoulde holde his speech for true, or rest in it, as certeine.</p>
                     <p>And therefore we see; that albeit the woman, whom her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band hath in <hi>Iclousie,</hi> is put <note n="3" place="margin">Num. 5. v. 22. vsque ad 28.</note> vnto a most strict oath (with an <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precation</hi> and <hi>curse)</hi> that <hi>she is not defiled:</hi> yet is there (by the law of God) appointed a further triall, and <hi>she is also to drinke the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed water.</hi> which (by Gods secret operation giuing might vnto it) was of force, both to reucale, and to punish her periurie (if she were forsworne) by making her (most lothsomely) to rotte a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the ground, being yet aliue.</p>
                     <p>Of further <hi>inquirie</hi> and the equitie of it, after the oath taken, and deniall or qualifying of the matter by the partie: we haue also sundry examples in the <note n="4" place="margin">l. 13. C. dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus creditis &amp; iureiur.</note>

                        <hi>Ordonnances</hi> or sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of <hi>France</hi> (touching a <hi>corporal oath</hi> to be taken) concerning the number, weight, measure, and place (intended) for vnlading of marchandises, to be shipped out thence: &amp; that there was no deceitefull or forbidden wares amongst them. Yet (this oathe notwithstanding) it is there further prouided, that <hi>if vpon inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to be made, any thing shal be found contrary to the declaration made by the partie vpon his oathe; he shall lose his marchandise, he is
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:19125:276"/>
grieuously to be fined, and besides shall be punished as a forger, called Falsarius, in the Ciuill lawes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By the lawes of this <hi>Realme,</hi> such further triall is vsually pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised; and proofes are very often made to the contrarie of that, which the defendant hath deliuered in, vpon his oathe. In the Court of <hi>Chancerie,</hi> if <hi>plaintifes</hi> should alwayes rest, and might proceede to no further proofes, after the <hi>defendant</hi> hath answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vpon his oathe: they shoulde (for the most parte) haue ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry colde suites, and small reliefe or remedie could bee giuen, by that <hi>high Court.</hi> The like is to be thought of the Courtes before the <hi>Queenes Counsels</hi> established in <hi>Wales,</hi> and in the <hi>North</hi> parts, and of the <hi>Court of Requests.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In that most honourable Court of the <hi>Starre Chamber,</hi> the defendants doe not onely answere the Bils preferred (by vertue of their oathes,) but also vnto sundry <hi>Interrogatories,</hi> seruing to the like purpose. And yet after all this, it is thought necessarie to vse further proofes also by <hi>witnesses;</hi> and not to bee conuenient, to rest onely vpon the <hi>honestie</hi> and <hi>conscience,</hi> of the supposed delinquent.</p>
                     <p>Besides this practise and long continued custome <hi>(quae est op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus legum Interpres)</hi> there be also statutes in the very point.</p>
                     <p>By the statute of <note n="1" place="margin">34. H. 8. ca. 4.</note> 
                        <hi>Bankrupts</hi> in K. <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. time, authoritie is giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to certaine there named, <hi>to call and examine such as are su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected to conceale such offenders goods; and to examine them by their oathes, and by other wayes (as in discretion they shall thinke meete) vpon the specialtie, certeintie, true declaration, &amp; knowledge of such offenders goods or debts owing to him: and if he shewe not the whole trueth</hi> (to bee after prooued by witnesses, &amp;c.) <hi>then hee forfei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth double the goods concealed.</hi> 
                        <note n="2" place="margin">13. Eliz. cap. 7.</note> And the very like clause in that matter of <hi>Bankrupts,</hi> is established by a statute, made in her <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties</hi> time.</p>
                     <p>At the <hi>Common</hi> lawe, the <hi>Iudges</hi> doe not alwayes rest in an oath of a <hi>partie;</hi> but doe sometimes <hi>enquire</hi> further of the trueth of it; and doe punish him also for taking a false oath, if he be thereof conuicted. <note n="3" place="margin">P. 5.

                        <hi>One was brought into the Court as a pledge, and did sweare he might dispend fortie shillings land by yeere: yet the Court rested not in this oath, but examined the matter more strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; vpon occasion that one then present, &amp; dwelling in the same place,
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:19125:277"/>
did affirme that the other might dispend nothing, and it being founde, that he could dispend but twentie shillings by yeere, he was committed to the Fleete, till he had paid his fine.</hi> So that (both by diuine and humane lawes) we see neither reason, equitie, nor practise; for <hi>Iudges</hi> (necessarily) to rest in a mans <hi>answere made vpon his oath;</hi> without proceeding to the taking of any further proofes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, the lawfulnesse of that oath (which I termed partly of <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> and partly of <hi>Enquirie)</hi> is more particularly also approued.</p>
                     <p>But the <hi>Treatisour</hi> condemneth all <hi>Canonicall purgations,</hi> as contrarie vnto equitie: and therefore termeth them <hi>deadly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, not healthfull but hurtfull, and poysoning purgations, dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously giuen for preseruatiues.</hi> Which if it were true, would take away not onely our reason taken from proofes which may bee made, euen after the parties <hi>Canonical purgation;</hi> but also the <hi>oath</hi> which I termed partly of <hi>purgation,</hi> and partly of <hi>Enquirie.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>What his reasons to that purpose be, it will not therefore bee amisse, briefly to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider: &amp; to adde also some-what, for clearing of lawes and courtes <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> from vniustice herein; and for the defence of the vse of <hi>purgations,</hi> by the parties owne othe, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The conclusion which (in this behalfe) he taketh vpon him to proue: is, that <hi>proceeding ex officio, to forced purgations is hard, and vniust dealing towards men; and a great abuse of the name and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie of Almightie God, cloked and shadowed neuerthelesse, vnder glorious and painted glosses, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But he mistaketh the matter greatly, to thinke that those mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which (in the aforesaid <hi>doctors</hi> schedule) he challengeth for no better then <hi>painted glosses, beautifull shewes,</hi> and <hi>fained preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> were by them set downe, for iustifying <hi>of purgations:</hi> for they were (in deed) principally by them mentioned, to shewe the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessitie of <hi>Enquiring</hi> by <hi>oath,</hi> and of <hi>punishing</hi> offenders. If I thought, that in his setting forth of the state of this question, he fixed any force in that point for that the proceeding is <hi>ex officio:</hi> I woulde then remitte the Reader vnto that, which hath bene spoken thereof, in the second parte.</p>
                     <p>For proofe of <hi>Iniustice</hi> thereby <hi>offered vnto men;</hi> hee presseth those <hi>Doctors</hi> with their owne <hi>maxime, viz. Nemo tenetur</hi> 
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Vide cap. 9. 3. part.</note> 
                        <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ipsum prodere.</hi> But why hee that is otherwise very <hi>presumptiuely</hi> detected; should not be driuen to shewe, and declare his <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie</hi>
                        <pb n="233" facs="tcp:19125:277"/>
vpon his oath, or else yeelde to the <hi>detect</hi> (which they also adde for the true vnderstanding thereof) he sheweth no reason: other then that, as <hi>a glosse confounding the text, It wholly</hi> (he saith) <hi>destroyeth that rule and principle.</hi> But how can it bee verified, that this <hi>principle</hi> is thereby wholy destroyed: when as the detection made by <hi>fame,</hi> by <hi>denunciatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> or <hi>presentment, &amp;c.</hi> commeth from others, and is not a mans owne detection of himselfe? therefore it is not so much as a <hi>limitation</hi> properly: but rather a true expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, how that rule ought to be vnderstood. By as good reason it might be said; that because a man, is not at first, by any course of Iustice, bound to discouer the very facte against himselfe; that therefore, being called into question, and touched by great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions, and arraigned for it; there is no Iustice to vrge him, to pleade either not guiltie, and so to lye; or else guiltie, and so to bewraye himselfe.</p>
                     <p>For proofe of <hi>an abuse</hi> of <hi>Gods name and Maiestie by purgati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: he sayeth, to offer an oathe vnto persons diffamed, concerning their owne corrupt life; argueth a lightnes, and want of good discretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the Magistrate. For that he wittingly doeth minister an occasion of periurie.</hi> I haue spoken of this point (by occasion) afore: and I trust the Readers wil pardon my necessary repetitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (sometime) of one matter in diuers places: considering the <hi>Treatisour</hi> vpon one reason, seeketh very often to build many seuerall, &amp; distinct conclusions.</p>
                     <p>First no man ought by any occasion whatsoeuer, be drawen to goe against his oath, or to periure himselfe; a word (most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly) verified in an oathe <hi>Assertorie,</hi> such as that of <hi>purgation</hi> is. Secondly, it is to bee denied, that whatsoeuer a man of a bad minde, may take for an <hi>occasion</hi> to forsweare himselfe; that in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery such case, it is <hi>lightnes,</hi> and <hi>vndiscretion in the Magistrate to offer an oathe.</hi> Which may appeare, by <hi>decisorie</hi> oathes, or <hi>wagers of lawe</hi> in actions reall, or personall for landes and goods: being such things, which be as deepely (by most men) tendered, and affected; as their owne good names, or honest <hi>reputations.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is too grieuous a charge, to bring euery <hi>lightnes or vndiscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Magistrate,</hi> within the compasse of <hi>abusing Gods name &amp; maiestie;</hi> though this were admitted to be such <hi>lightnes.</hi> Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, no lawe presumeth so vncharitably, as though euery one <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected,</hi> or <hi>presented of corrupt life,</hi> were straightway, of necessitie,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:19125:278"/>
and in very deed, guiltie of such crime: nor yet is it to bee inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that most which be (in trueth) guiltie, will rather forsweare themselues then confesse the trueth: considering the penaltie inflicted by courtes <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> are not very grieuous; and the chiefe end therein aymed at, is but an <hi>inducement</hi> vnto, &amp; a <hi>testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of the delinque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts repentance. Fiftly, euery one who vpon a <hi>fame</hi> is <hi>detected</hi> or <hi>presented,</hi> cannot be truely said, to be thereupo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                        <hi>diffamed, infamia iuris.</hi> For a fame may rise, yea, &amp; very probable cause of suspition of a crime, may also be giuen; where, neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse the fact is not at all committed. Lastly, it is not euery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son suspected of any crime, who in discretion of the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> is not to be vrged with an oathe: but it is such an one who is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably suspected; to be more likely to forsweare himselfe, then to confesse a trueth.</p>
                     <p>But herein he presseth vs yet further, with a piece of old coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell, viz. <hi>Dedecus magis quàm periculum vites.</hi> Whosoeuer giues this counsell, if hee shoulde meane, that the <hi>perill of a mans soule</hi> were rather to be embraced, then any <hi>worldly shame:</hi> it were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vnsounde, and wicked counsell. For it is better, to loose, not onely our whole credites in the worlde, yea, &amp; all the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, rather then our owne soules. It is (in trueth) but an exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation vnto valor, and courage: and that a man in a good cause, should rather incurre any bodily perill, then empaire or distaine his honor, and loyaltie to his countrie, by cowardise. Besides, in matters <hi>spirituall,</hi> and belonging to the <hi>soule;</hi> there is a <hi>shame</hi> which bringeth honor, as <hi>Ecclesiasticus writeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>He inueigheth also against them <hi>ex absurdo:</hi> because <hi>if purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions should be vsed</hi> (he saieth) <hi>at the Common Lawe</hi> vpon <hi>Endite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of felonie, or other criminall causes; periurie would ouerflowe the land.</hi> I am also of this minde, that if for matters of life &amp; death a man might be acquited vpon his owne oathe, and his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purgators:</hi> that many wilfull periuries would be committed. But othes of purgation bee not imposed, any more at the <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall</hi> lawe, then they be at the Common lawe, in any matters <hi>capitall.</hi> And as <hi>purgation,</hi> is onely <hi>a presumptiue</hi> kinde of clearing, to remoue the offense, &amp; for safegard of his credit, who being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famed, can iustly and truely performe it: so is it no such finall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitall, but that the <hi>partie purged</hi> may againe be conuented for the same: if any man (by lawe allowed) will vndertake the
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:19125:278"/>
proofe, not of the <hi>same,</hi> but of the very crime and offense it selfe, whereof hee was afore purged. As for other <hi>criminall causes,</hi> which endanger not <hi>life,</hi> nor <hi>limme:</hi> diuerse <hi>Temporall courtes</hi> (though not <hi>vpon Enditements)</hi> without such feare of driuing men to periurie, do minister, &amp; vrge the parties othes, as hath bin shewed. Yet not holding them purged, or cleared thereby, albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it they deny the crimes; but <hi>enquiring</hi> further, and <hi>examining</hi> witnesses also afterwardes, touching the trueth of the offense. Besides, such othes be ministred in those <hi>Temporal</hi> courtes, vpon no detection of <hi>fame,</hi> or other <hi>presumption,</hi> grounded vpon the othes of any: but vpon the priuate vindicatiue minde of him, which putteth in the bill, and prosecuteth. Lastly, there bee fewe or none of the crimes called <hi>transeuntia,</hi> and not <hi>capitall,</hi> which be enquirable in any courtes temporal: or if any be, they are not (in their owne nature) so secretly and without possibilitie of direct proofe performed: as the crime of <hi>incontinencie</hi> is; tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching which, most <hi>purgations</hi> fall out in <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi> courtes. There was therefore small cause of that his question here, viz. Why <hi>Ecclesiastical courtes offer not to the laitie, the like good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and vpright, and sincere Iustice; that themselues finde in courtes temporal?</hi> Besides that by the same question, hee indirectly also taxeth all courtes whatsoeuer, that impose othe on the partie; for <hi>want of good measure, and of vpright and sincere Iustice.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Vpon the former reasons against <hi>purgation,</hi> he grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther question also, viz. <hi>Why these ordinaries (which challenge, or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume to themselues the goodly name, and title of spiritual men) doe not proceede to condemnation, by good proofe of lawfull witnesses: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine absolue the partie diffamed, where such sufficient proofe failes them?</hi> I answere, first, <hi>Ordinaries</hi> doe not in these dayes, eyther <hi>challenge,</hi> or <hi>assume</hi> to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues such <hi>goodly name,</hi> as he solaceth himselfe at: but rather, the title of <hi>persons,</hi> or <hi>Iudges Ecclesiastical.</hi> In deede, that other name (in times past) was willingly embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the <hi>Cleargie:</hi> and (as they thought) without any iniurie to other callings, in respecte of the <hi>subiect</hi> matter of their profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, which is <hi>spirituall.</hi> And by no mans writings or speeches, is it more often attributed vnto them, euen vntill this day; then it is in statutes of the Realme, in reportes, and vsuall speeches at the <hi>Commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> law.</hi> Therefore was there y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lesse coloure, that <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> should be vpbrayded with it: as if they of their owne heads
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:19125:279"/>
did vainely arrogate, that title vnto themselues. Secondly, <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinaries</hi> doe in all causes not confessed; proceede to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon <hi>witnesses,</hi> and <hi>matter of Recorde:</hi> or vnto absolution, vpon fayling in proofe: sauing in crimes, which be of that secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in their owne nature; so as witnesses of the very crime, by no likelyhood can be had: yet alwayes, where such probable <hi>induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> thereof doe lye; as doe inferre <hi>a fame,</hi> or giue <hi>scandall</hi> to the well affected, and are euill examples to the weake, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stayed. Thirdly, if no <hi>condemnation</hi> of a man be iust in any court; but vpon good proofe of lawfull witnesses, deposing of their owne sightes and knowledges; then doeth he withall impugne, the vsual, and lawful <hi>Iustice</hi> of this land, by <hi>Iuries:</hi> who in crimes of very high qualitie, are often, &amp; may be led, sometimes by one witnes: yea, and he, the partie that preferres vp the <hi>Inditement:</hi> and sometimes though by moe witnesses then one; yet all depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing vpon <hi>probabilities, presumptions,</hi> and other pregnant, or likely <hi>inducements,</hi> to proue the partie to be guiltie. Like wise he ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwes also hereby, <hi>all waging of law</hi> by the parties <hi>Iudicial othe,</hi> taken in courtes of the <hi>Common lawe,</hi> about chattels, debtes, and landes. For a man hauing but two handes of <hi>Compurgators,</hi> swearing for the trueth of his oathe, vpon their owne credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities: shal be thereby relieued and acquited against his aduersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, without any witnesse at all. For the <hi>Treatisour</hi> himselfe tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vs; that <hi>wager of lawe</hi> is not permitted, where any one witnesse, or writing may bee had. and if the partie will not take such oathe, being offered; then is he (without <hi>witnesse, writing,</hi> or other <hi>confession)</hi> condemned for the matter, in demaunde. Now, sauing that it is not in a cause <hi>cryminal;</hi> what doeth this <hi>wager of lawe</hi> else, differ from a <hi>purgation?</hi> and what lesse danger of <hi>dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, poyson,</hi> or <hi>periurie,</hi> is there herein, especially, if the matter be of any weight and moment; then there is in <hi>purgations,</hi> at the law <hi>Ecclesiastical?</hi> and yet neuerthelesse, both of them be <hi>good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, vpright, &amp; sincere dealing, in all course of good Iustice.</hi> Lastly, if in crimes of that hidden nature, he would haue all <hi>diffamed</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons without more adoe, discharged and absolued; where two witnesses of the very fact cannot be had: he might then in steede of feare, that <hi>periurie</hi> (in the other case) <hi>would ouerflow the land:</hi> stand wel assured in this, that adulterie, and lecherie, might, and would more freely ouerflow it, without all touch or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trolment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="237" facs="tcp:19125:279"/>
Admitting that which the <hi>Treatisour</hi> further alledgeth, out of the <hi>grieuances</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> to this purpose, to be truely by him set down: yet there is nothing there obiected, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth these <hi>purgations.</hi> For the first fault there found, is only, for that men vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> false reports &amp; sclanders being brought before Ordinaries, &amp; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing <hi>purged</hi> themselues; do neuertheles pay for their letters of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution, which ought rather to be paid by such, as falsly accused them. Whether any such thing were practised then in <hi>Germanie</hi> or no, I know not. heate of opposition, &amp; sharpenesse of humour, makes men sometimes, either wilfully, or by mistaking, to misre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port matters hapning euen at their owne doores. But I stand not to defend abuses, by any man offred against law. The law is, that vpon an <hi>accusation,</hi> a man shall not be put to oath of <hi>purgation:</hi> except the proofes made (though they do not conuince) yet doe greatly burthen and charge him, by vehement <hi>presumptions,</hi> or <hi>scandall.</hi> And if he do then purge, &amp; cleare himselfe, the accuser is to be condemned in charges. And though by <hi>Accuser</hi> here, any priuate <hi>prosecutor</hi> were to be vnderstood, yet (vpon the <hi>purgation)</hi> euen such must likewise, defray the charges; because it is <hi>calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia praesumpta.</hi> But if <hi>publike Officers,</hi> that are appointed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, do make <hi>denunciation;</hi> then are they to pay no charges: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse not onely the <hi>presumed calumniation,</hi> and <hi>conspiracie;</hi> but also, a true and <hi>formall calumniation,</hi> be found against them.</p>
                     <p>The next grieuances there pretended, &amp; by him alledged, are: for that vpon <hi>diffaming</hi> one of another through anger; both the partie that did diffame, must take oath, that what was spoken by him, was not deliberately, but vpon displeasure vttered: and the partie diffamed, that hee or shee, is not an adulterer, &amp;c. as they were by the other slandered to be. whereby is inferred, as incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiences; that both vnlawfull gaine, is thereby sought, and wilful periurie forced.</p>
                     <p>It is no maruaile in deed, though such, &amp; greater inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces also should happe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where due proceeding in law is not obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. for neither of these two last courses, is warranted by any law, nor yet followed by any practise in this Realm, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I know, or haue heard of: therfore <hi>culpateneat autores.</hi> So that <hi>Purgation</hi> in it selfe, is not assigned (we see) for any of those <hi>Germaine grieuances.</hi>
