            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Exact Description of the Growth, Quality, and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of the Leaf TEE, alias TAY, Drawn up for Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
of Persons of Quality, and the Good of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in General.</head>
            <p>TEE is generally brought from <hi>China,</hi> and groweth upon little Trees (for the most part) in one of the six Northern Provinces of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
called <hi>Xemsi,</hi> Latitude 36 Degrees, Bordering upon the West of the Province of <hi>Honam;</hi> the Leaf is about the bigness of <hi>Scordium</hi> or
<hi>Mirtle,</hi> there are divers sorts of it, some much better then other, and the upper Leaves do excel the other in fineness (a property almost in all
Plants) there is likewise of the Growth of <hi>Iapan,</hi> and is called <hi>Cha</hi> or <hi>Tcha.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The said Leaf is of such known Vertues, that those very Nations, so Famous for Antiquity, Knowledge and Wisdome, doe frequently sell it
among themselves, for its weight in Silver; and the high estimation of the Drink made therewith, hath occasioned an enquiry into the Nature there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
among the most Intelligent Persons of all Nations, that have Travelled into those Parts; who after exact Tryal and Experience by all wayes ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable,
have commended it to the Use of their several Countries for its Vertues and Operation, perticularly as followeth, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> Quality <hi>is moderately Hot.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Drink is Declared to be most Wholsome, Preserving in Perfect Health until Extreme Old Age.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Perticular Vertues are these:</head>
               <p>IT maketh the Body active and lusty, strengthning the Muscles and Sinnews.</p>
               <p>It helpeth the Head-ach, Giddiness and Heaviness thereof.</p>
               <p>It removeth the Obstructions of the Spleen.</p>
               <p>Its very good against the Stone and Gravel, cleansing the Kidneys and Ureteries.</p>
               <p>It taketh away the difficulty of breathing, opening Obstructions.</p>
               <p>Its good against Lipitude, Distillations, and cleareth the Sight.</p>
               <p>It removeth Lassitude, and cleanseth and purifieth adust Humors, and a Hot Liver.</p>
               <p>Its good against Crudities.</p>
               <p>It strengthneth the weakness of the Ventricle or Stomack, and causeth a good Appetite and Digestion.</p>
               <p>It vanquisheth heavie Dreams, easeth the Brain, strengthneth the Memory.</p>
               <p>It overcometh superfluous Sleep, and prevents Sleepiness in general, a draught of the Infusion being taken, so that without trouble whole Nights
may be spent in Study, without hurt to the Body, in that it moderately heateth and bindeth the mouth of the Stomack.</p>
               <p>It prevents Agues, Surfets, and Fevers, by infusing a fit quantity of the Leaf, thereby provoking a most gentle Vomit, and breathing of the Pores.</p>
               <p>It strengthneth the inward Parts, and prevents Consumptions.</p>
               <p>It asswageth the Pains of the Bowels.</p>
               <p>It cureth Colds, Dropsies, and Scurveys, by a proper Infusion, purging the Blood by Sweat and Urine, and expelleth Infections.</p>
               <p>It drives away all pains in the Collick proceeding from Wind.</p>
               <p>It purgeth safely the Gall.</p>
               <p>And that the Vertues and Excellencies of this Leaf and Drink are many and great, is evident and manifest by the high esteem and use of it (especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
of late years) among the Physicians and knowing men both in <hi>France, Holland,</hi> and other Parts of Christendome; and in <hi>England</hi> it hath been sold
in the Leaf for six pound, and somtimes for ten pounds the pound weight, and in respect of its former scarceness and dearness, it hath been only used as
a <hi>Regalia,</hi> in high Treatments and Entertainments, and Presents made thereof to Princes and Grandees, till about the yeer 1657, <hi>Thomas Garway</hi> of
<hi>London</hi> Merchant, living in <hi>Sweeting</hi>'s Rents neer the <hi>Royal Exchange,</hi> did purchase a quantity thereof, and there first publiquely sold the said <hi>Tay</hi> in Leaf
and Drink made according to the Directions of the most knowing Merchants and Travellers into those Eastern Countries: And upon Knowledge and
Experience of the said <hi>Garways</hi> continued Care and Industry in obtaining the best <hi>Tee,</hi> and making the Drink thereof, very many Noblemen, Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
Merchants, and Gentlemen of Quality, have ever since sent to him for the said Leaf, and daylie resort thither to drink the Drink thereof.</p>
               <p>And that Ignorance or Envie may have no Ground or Power to Report or Suggest that what is herein asserted of the Vertues and Excellencies of this
precious Leaf and Drink, hath more of Designe then Truth; for the Justification of my self, and Satisfaction of others. I have here ennumerated se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Authors, who in their Learned Works have expresly Written and Asserted the same, and much more, in Honour of this Noble Leaf and Drink, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>And to the end that all Persons of Eminency and Quality, Gentlemen, and others residing in or neer the Court, <hi>Westminster,</hi> and Parts adjacent, may the
better be fitted and supplied, the said <hi>Tho. Garway</hi> hath now purposely taken part of a House in the paved Yard or Court by the <hi>Harp</hi> and <hi>Ball</hi> at <hi>Charing

and the several Vertues afore-mentioned.</p>
               <p>And such as have occasion for Spanish <hi>Chocolata</hi> in the Cake, from three shillings to ten shillings the pound weight, and right Turkey <hi>Coffe-berry</hi> pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verized,
