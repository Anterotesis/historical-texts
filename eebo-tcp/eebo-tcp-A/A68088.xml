         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But domeſticall examples are of all other the moſt
powerfull. And therefore whatſoeuer effect this ſhall
haue with others, it ought in ſpeciall manner to preuaile
with you, who had ſo ſpeciall intereſt in her, whoſe

others, that you had then in her, you take that courſe

ſo her latter end was not vnlike; full of piety and
patience, of alacritie and cheerefulnes, wholy taken
vp with holy and heauenly meditation, and longing
exceedingly for the time of her diſſolution. God
ſhewed in her to all that were about her, that it is
not in vaine ſincerely to ſerue him; and that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
courſe of a religious life will miniſter aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of ſweet comfort in death.</p>
            <p>About the beginning of her laſt ſicknes, ſhe ſent
for me to her, whom (though the meaneſt of many
that reſorted vnto her) in regard of ſome bond of
alliance ſhe deſired to be, and made account ſhee
might be boldeſt withall; and before ſome few of
her familiar frends, made a worthy and pithy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
and profeſſion of her Faith, too long to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late;
laid open the grounds and notes of her aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
fetched forth of Gods word, of Gods loue
vnto her, and of her owne vnto God; requeſting ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be better informed, if in ought ſhe were
miſtaken, or to haue further confirmed by pregnant
proofes out of Gods booke, what ſhe rightly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended.
And this was the worke that by her good
will ſhee then deſired to be continually taken vp
with; forgetting her paines and weaknes when ſhe
was about it, and neglecting her naturall reſt to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
it. So that ſhe might well ſay to God with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi>
               <note n="ſ" place="margin">Pſal. 119 97.</note> 
               <hi>Oh how loue I thy law? it is my continuall medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
And with <hi>Iob,</hi>
               <note n="t" place="margin">Job. 23. 12.</note> 
               <hi>I haue preferred the words of
thy mouth, not onely before my moſt deſired foode, but
<pb facs="tcp:3072:7"/>
before my moſt needfull and naturall reſt.</hi> Yea ſo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
was ſhe vpon theſe things, that I was enforced
oft to perſwade her to forbeare, conſidering her
great weaknes, and to intermit the intention of her
meditation, by giuing ſome way to reſt and repoſe.
And here I cannot paſſe by one ſpeech vſed by her
vpou ſuch an occaſion, which the rather I relate, to
prouoke others by her example not to neglect the
meanes of mercy and grace that God vouchſafeth
them now, while they may follow them. After long
diſcourſe to and fro, perceiuing, as I thought, her
eyes to wax heauy, and her ſpirits fainty, and well
knowing what need ſhe had of ſome refreſhing, I
aduiſed her to compoſe her ſelf vnto reſt, which her
long want of it required, and her eyes ſeemed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
vnto, that it was beſt to take it while ſhe might,
leſt ſhe ſhould after, want it when ſhe would. Her
anſwer was that this was her beſt reſt, &amp; that which
ſhe found beſt refreſhing &amp; ſweeteſt repoſe in; and
that, ſaid ſhe, which you ſay of the one, may I much

is apparent, in that the Apoſtle not onely profeſſeth

approueth it alſo, as in himſelfe here, ſo in others as

            <p>And it may be further confirmed vnto vs,<note place="margin">Reaſon 1.</note> if we

Firſt, to be freed from mortalitie and the miſeries
of this life<note n="l" place="margin">1. King. 19. 4.</note>; that we may <hi>rest from our labours</hi>
               <note n="m" place="margin">Apoc. 14. 13.</note>;
<hi>that mortalitie may be ſwallowed vp of life</hi>

can not be in ordinarie courſe but by death.</p>
            <p>Secondly, to be freed from ſpirituall euils<note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 7. 24.</note>, that
will not leaue vs but by death<note n="p" place="margin">Eccleſ 7. 22. Rom. 67.</note>.</p>

            <p>To the latter queſtion, I anſwer, that firſt this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
it muſt be without impatience: (that was <hi>Ionas</hi>

haue no cauſe to loue life; ſo they haue no neede to

endure; ſo they haue great cauſe to deſire death,
that putteth an end to them all; that ſetteth them
