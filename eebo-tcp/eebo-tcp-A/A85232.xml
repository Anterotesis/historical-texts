            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PLAIN FAVLT IN Plain - Engliſh.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S two Ships ſetting Saile out of one Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, the one going to the Weſt, &amp; the other to the Eaſt, yet (if they continue in that courſe) muſt néeds méet together in the wrong ſide of the world: So <hi>Plain-Engliſh</hi> going one way in an intention for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and Doctor <hi>Fearne,</hi> (going another way againſt the Publique) méet in one and the ſame wrong opinion and error, deſtructive to Parliaments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plaine-Engliſh</hi> will deſtroy Parliaments, by the peoples reſuming their power, becauſe the Parliament goes not high enough, in Termes, Conditions, and Actions.</p>
            <p>The Doctor, and his fellow-Malignants, will have the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament diſſolved, becauſe it goes too high, and will not lay down the Common-wealth at the féet of the Cavaliers, preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the name of the King.</p>
            <p>So both ſpeak to have it done, but upon contrary Reaſons, confuting each other: For, if the Reaſon of <hi>Plain-Engliſh</hi> be
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:124130:3"/>
good, the Doctors Reaſon is naught; and if the Doctors Reaſon be good, <hi>Plaine-Engliſh's</hi> Reaſon is naught. But the Doctor ſaith <hi>Plain-Engliſh's</hi> Reaſon is naught, and <hi>Plain-Engliſh</hi> ſaith the Doctors Reaſon is naught, and I beléeve both, and ſo the buſineſſe is ended.</p>
            <p>Yet to talk and walk a little farther with them, (but ſetting one on the one hand, and the other on the other, and my ſelfe in the middle to keep them from fighting) I would ask them ſome Queſtions of Iuſtice, Honeſty, and Reaſon.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Is it juſt that the debts of the Kingdome ſhould be paid? and if ſo, I intreat my fellow-walkers to tell me who ſhall pay them, if the Parliament ſhall be diſſolved? If they ſay, Another Parliament, how be they ſure that another Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament may not be more diſpleaſing to them then this, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be diſſolved as well as this?</p>
            <p>Secondly, Did not men lend upon the Act of continuing this Parliament? So that the Act of Continuance is the very Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new of their ſecurity, and that which drew them into the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of lending. And of whom ſhall our Brethren the Scots require the performance of Publique Faith, if the Parliament (that gave this Faith) be annihilated and diſſolved? And is it honeſt to borrow money upon Security, and then to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Security, upon which it was borrowed? Surely, he that borrowes money upon Bonds, and then takes away the Bonds, deſerves another name beſides that of an honeſt man, and muſt look to borow no more of any that know it. And thus the Act of Continuance is turned into an Act of Couſinage, while it is made a Lure to draw in Truſt, but diſabled to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In Reaſon, or in many Reaſons, (if any Reaſon can be alledged, for which indeed none can be ſufficient) it is for the Publique good, <hi>Quia periclitatur ſalus populi,</hi> The Publique is in danger. This Publique danger muſt be ſo evidently and apparently cauſed by the Parliament, that the whole People, or (at leaſt) the greater part of it muſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee it, judge it, and agree in it: But while there are two
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:124130:3"/>
parts, one that ſaith the danger is cauſed by the Parliaments <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſing too high, a ſecond by the Parliaments going too low, a third beléeving neither, (for neither of theſe beléeves one another) but thinking the Parliament goes aright, or (at leaſt) a tolerable way: How ſhall we think ſo many diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts will agrée upon one evident cauſe of danger? And of ſo many parts and ſides differ, who ſhall be the Iudge of the Controverſie betweene the Conteſtants? Surely, if the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament may continue but till theſe thrée parts agrée, either up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Reaſon for which the Parliament ſhall be diſſolved, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>uſing a publique danger, or upon a Iudge to determine and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>udge their agréement, the Parliament may continue long enough, and by the Parliaments not ending, this Queſtion may be at an end. And certainly this Queſtion was raiſed in a moſt unſeaſonable, and therefore moſt unreaſonable time: For, (when the people are divided into divers opinions, as well as Armies) is that a fit time to ſpeak of agréeing toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in re-aſſuming their power, when they diſagrée in the Reaſons of it unto death?</p>
            <p>But againe, if the Votes of the people muſt be gathered by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Iudge, where ſhall this Iudge ſit when he gathers theſe Votes? Muſt the people méet all together in one place, or be taken by poll in their ſeverall pariſhes? If they méet in one place, that will end the Queſtion, by putting out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, that <hi>Salus Populi periclitabitur,</hi> publique danger will certainly follow, by this way of avoiding publique danger: For you muſt bring two ſorts of people together, that have main Armies on each ſide, and if ſo, whether wil not the people be in more danger by this méeting, then by the Parliament? but this the Swords and Guns will ſoone tell you. And if he muſt goe or ſend into pariſhes, ſurely I think <hi>Plain-Engliſh</hi> will be loath to compute the Votes of the pariſhes in <hi>Oxford,</hi> or <hi>New-caſtle,</hi> nor the Doctor to take the Votes in <hi>Windſor</hi> or <hi>London.</hi> And if the Parliament may continue untill this polling be done, I think it will be as good as an Act of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:124130:4"/>But yet further, if moſt Votes muſt carry it, it will be a Legall <hi>Quare,</hi> Whether thoſe that have leſſe then 40. s. <hi>per Ann.</hi> ſhall have Votes, which is denyed in the choice of the Knights of the Shire?</p>
            <p>Againe, Whether thoſe that are maintained by the Pariſhes ſhall give Votes, who have no Votes in chooſing of Burgeſſes, and eſpecially whether ſuch men ſhall be fit to judge of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique danger, for the diſſolving of a Parliament?</p>
            <p>But thus Error is infinite in by-paths, and wandrings, and thus it falls out, when men (leaving the old lawfull, and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall way) will tread out paths of their own making, and being onely of private condition, will take upon them the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment or rather the Diſſolution of the frame of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique. But this is the common fault of mutable and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repining Man-kind: If <hi>Ziklag</hi> be burnt, and wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren carryed away, then they talk of ſtoning <hi>David.</hi> But if the foundations be thus deſtroyed, what hath the righteous done? Surely it had béen a point of diſcretion, (I will not ſay of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and good manners) to have ſpent ſome thoughts firſt in a faire and admonitory way to have obtained this end, before they fall to deſtroying and rooting out Foundations, and plucking up Parliaments, and conſequently Kingdoms by the roots: For certainly, if ſuch a thing ſhould be done, (which indéed is as unſeaſonable as it is deſtructive) there could be no fréedome, certainty, nor continuance in Parliaments, &amp; then, as good to have none at all. They muſt vote like men in chaines, not their owne votes and conſciences, but the votes and opinions of others: and they muſt not promiſe nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract any thing for the Publique, except they ſend home to know their opinion that muſt rule them in their Votes. And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if this way be throughly followed, it may lead men, aſwell to re-aſſume Laws, as power of Law-making, and then into what a Chaos of confuſion doe they reſolve (or rather diſſolve) this ancient, and wel-grounded Government?</p>
            <p>But (as I ſaid) if they would have had ſuch a thing done a handſome way, theſe re-aſſumers ſhould have brought the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:124130:4"/>
together, to have found out, and agréed upon ſome invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible and manifeſt Reaſons (for ſuch they had néed to be) to prove that the Parliament ſhould ceaſe for the publique good, and ſo propoſe them to the Parliament: For, they know the Parl. hath power to diſſolve it ſelfe, and it is very prepoſterous to thruſt them out of doores, before you aske them whether they will goe out voluntarily of themſelves, eſpecially being ſetled by an Act of Parl. And I aſſure you, by that knowledge I have of many (if not moſt) of the Houſe of Commons, if you can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hew a way how Religion, Liberty and ſafety, and conſequently <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Common good, can be better ſetled by their abſence then preſence, (that ſo they may leave their baniſhment, and return to their homes) I think you may have eaſily not their places onely, but their thanks: For, little pleaſure, and certainly leſſe profit it is for them to leave their own buſineſſes and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, (I ſay not Recreations) to work and toile in publique buſineſſes, yea to be often put to make brick without ſtraw, even to work impoſſibilities, and to pleaſe two contrarieties, or elſe to be beaten (on all ſides) with ſuch terrible Taſk-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters as theſe Re-aſſumers.</p>
            <p>But perchance too much hath béen ſaid againſt thoſe cruel, unreaſonable, and unjuſt ſpéeches of re-aſſuming, eſpecially where the people, Péeres and King have given their Votes and Faith (by an Act of Continuance) that there ſhall be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſuming. And if nothing elſe, yet let Gods owne wonderfull hand ſtretched out in working for the Parliament, and by it, ſtop the mouthes that are opened againſt it. It was wont to be the common language of the Petitions of moſt Counties, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the great bleſſings God had ſent to them, by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied labour and ſervice of the Parliament, as the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the High-Commiſſion, Star-Chamber, and Ship-money, &amp;c. but now advantages and exceptions muſt be ſought out againſt it. And admit there are ſome failings, and ſome weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; was there not a great Apoſtle that gloryed in infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, becauſe when he was weak, he was made ſtrong? and no wonder, for God himſelfe had told him, that in weakneſſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:124130:5"/>
his ſtrength doth appeare. And appeared it hath, ſince God (by them) hath overthrowne ſuch ſtrong-holds, as former Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments have not béen able to remove, but have rather ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened againſt themſelves. Doe not weaken thoſe whom God doth ſtrengthen for himſelfe, but rather joyne with God in ſtrengthning their weakneſſe by ſupplyes, prayers, and (if you will) faithfull, and petitionary advice: and doe not fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Miracle of Gods making: a miracle, I ſay, (for ſuch our Fore-fathers would have eſteemed a Parliament ſetled by an Act of Continuance) deſtroy not then what he hath ſo won<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derfully built, neither deſpiſe his building, though it appeare, not very glorious in fleſhly eyes: Rather ſay with the Prophet, <q>
                  <note place="margin">Hag. 2. 3.</note>Who is among you that ſaw this houſe in her firſt glory? and how do you ſee it now? is it not in your eyes (in compariſon of it) as nothing? Yet now be ſtrong O Zerubbabel, and be ſtrong O Ioſhua the ſon of Ioſedech (the High Prieſt) and be ſtrong ye people of the land, and worke; for I am with you (ſaith the Lord of Hoſts) The Glory of this latter Houſe ſhall be greater then of the frrmer (ſaith the Lord of Hoſts) and in this place I will give peace (ſaith the Lord of Hoſts)</q> And let all the people ſay. <hi>Amen.</hi>
