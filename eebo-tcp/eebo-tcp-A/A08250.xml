            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l>ABout the time when vesper, in the west,</l>
               <l>Gan set the euening watch, and silent night</l>
               <l>Sent sleepe and slumber to possesse the world,</l>
               <l>Vnder the starry Canapy of Heauen,</l>
               <l>I laid me downe, laden with many cares,</l>
               <l>Fast by the streame where Tame and Isis meet,</l>
               <l>Euen at that time, all in a fragrant Meade:</l>
               <l>In sight of that faire Castle that or'elookes</l>
               <l>The forrest one way, and the fertill val,</l>
               <l>Watred with that renowned Riuer Thames</l>
               <l>Olde Windsor Castle did I take my rest.</l>
               <l>When Cynthia, companion of the night,</l>
               <l>Piercing mine eie-lids, as I lay along,</l>
               <l>Awakt me through: Therewith me thought I saw,</l>
               <l>A royall glimmering light, streaming aloft,</l>
               <l>A Titan mounted on the Lions backe,</l>
               <l>Had cloath'd himselfe in fiery pointed beames</l>
               <l>To chase the night and entertaine the Moone.</l>
               <l>Yet scarce had Phaebe gon hir iourney through,</l>
               <l>Sleeping, or waking, as alone I lay,</l>
               <l>Mine eies, and eares, and sences all were seru'd,</l>
               <l>With euery obiect perfect in his kinde,</l>
               <l>And lo, (a wonder to my sences all)</l>
               <l>I might discerne a troope of Horsemen ride,</l>
               <l>Arm'd <hi>Cape de Pe,</hi> with shield &amp; shiuering launce,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:10695:10"/>As in a plash, or calme transparent brooke,</l>

               <l>For tournament, as if the God of warre</l>
               <l>Had held a iusts in honor of his loue.</l>
               <l>Therewith I heard the clarions &amp; the shalmes,</l>
               <l>The Shakbuts, and a number instruments</l>
               <l>Of seuerall kindes: but lowdest of them all,</l>
               <l>A Trumpe more shrill, then Tritons is at sea,</l>
               <l>The same renowne, precurser of the traine,</l>
               <l>Did sound (for who ringes lowder the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> renowne)</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I lookt to see an end of that I saw,</l>
               <l>And still me thought the trayne did multiply,</l>
               <l>And yeilding cloudes gaue way &amp; men at armes</l>
               <l>Succeede as fast at one anothers heeles,</l>
               <l>As in the Vast Mediterranean sea,</l>
               <l>The rowling waues doe one beget another,</l>
               <l>Weary of looking vp, I laid me downe</l>
               <l>Willing to rest, as sleepy soules are wont,</l>
               <l>When of a sodaine such a noyse I heard</l>
               <l>Of shot of Ord'nance pealing in mine eares,</l>
               <l>As twenty thousand Tyre had plaid at sea:</l>

               <l>Had bent their great Artillery for warre.</l>
               <l>And weary Atlas had let fall his loade,</l>
               <l>Enough to wake Endimion from his traunce.</l>

               <l>Annoyde mine eies, I gaz'd and as I lookt,</l>
               <l>Me thought this host of Aery armed men</l>
               <l>Girt Windsor Castle round: anon I saw</l>
               <l>Vnder a Canapy of Crimson bisse,</l>
               <l>Spangled with gold, and set with siluer bells,</l>
               <l>That sweetly chym'd and lul'd me halfe a sleepe,</l>
               <l>A goodly King in robes most richly dight,</l>
               <l>The vpper like a Romaine Palliament,</l>
               <l>In deede a Chapperon, for such it was:</l>
               <l>And looking neerer, loe, vppon his legge</l>
               <l>An auncient badge of honor I espide,</l>
               <l>A Garter brightly glistering in mine eie,</l>
               <l>A worthy ornament. Then I cal'd to minde</l>
               <l>What Princely Edward of that name the third,</l>
               <l>King Edward for his great atchiuement fam'd</l>
               <l>What he began: The order of Saint George,</l>
               <l>That at this day is honoured through the world</l>
               <l>The order of the Garter now t'is cal'd.</l>
               <l>Famous through all the world for honour and antiquity</l>
               <l>Grac'd by a King, and fauoured of his peeres,</l>
               <l>Fam'd by his followers worthy kings &amp; queenes</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Some say the manner how this grew at first,</l>
               <l>Was thus. The King disposed on a time</l>
               <l>To reuell after hee had shaken Fraunce,</l>
               <l>And deckt his Lyons with their flower de-luce,</l>
               <l>Dispos'd to reuell: some say otherwise</l>
               <l>Found on the ground by fortune as he went,</l>
               <l>A ladyes Garter: and the Queene I trow,</l>
               <l>Lost in a daunce and tooke it vp himselfe.</l>

               <l>Our office that had beene, or some what else.</l>
               <l>King <hi>Edward</hi> wistly looking on them all,</l>

               <l>T'aduance that Garter, and to institute</l>
               <l>A noble order sacred to Saint George,</l>

               <l>&amp; seru'd for an ensign, &amp; was crown'd with victory</l>
               <l>Hereon I thought when I beheld the King,</l>
               <l>I was instructed in the circumstance,</l>
               <l>And found it was King <hi>Edward</hi> that did march</l>
               <l>In robes, like those he ware when with his Lords</l>
               <l>He held Saint <hi>Georges</hi> royall feast on earth,</l>

               <l>He wan: for terrour to the Frenchmens hearts,</l>
               <l>His countenaunce was, his sword an iron scourge,</l>
               <l>Hee on a cole-blacke Corser mounted was,</l>
               <l>And in his hand a battle-axe he held,</l>
               <l>His Beuer vp, his corslet was of steele,</l>
               <l>Varnisht as blacke as iet: his bases blacke,</l>
               <l>

               <l>As blacke as night: but in a twincke me thought</l>
               <l>He chang'd at once his habit and his steede,</l>
               <l>And had a Garter as his father had,</l>
               <l>But rich and costly, with imbrodery</l>
               <l>Of Pearle, and Gould I could on it discerne.</l>
               <l>The Poesy whereof I spake of yore,</l>
               <l>And well I wot since this King <hi>Edward</hi> daies,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>At last I found King <hi>Edward</hi> was the man,</l>

               <l>That from the spatious Aery house of fame</l>
               <l>Set forward royall to sollemnize</l>
