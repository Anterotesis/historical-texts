         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

We Greet you well. Whereas by Our Letter of the 21<hi>st</hi> of <hi>August</hi> last past,
We were graciously pleased to inform you of Our Designs in order to the Ease
of Our <hi>Roman Catholick Subjects,</hi> unto which we had your Dutiful Answer in
some days thereafter; We have now thought fit to Publish these Our Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Intentions, and to give an Additional Ease to those of Tender Conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
so to convince the World of Our Inclinations to Moderation, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
that those of the Clergy who have been Regular, are Our most particular
Care; though We have given some Ease to those Principles, We can with
any Safety Trust: We have at the same time expressed Our highest In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
against those Enemies of Christianity, as well as Government, and
Humane Society, <hi>The Field Conventiclers,</hi> whom We recommend to you to
Root out with all the Severities of Our Laws, and with the most vigorous
Prosecution of Our Forces, it being equally Our, and Our Peopl's concern,
to be rid of them. As for the other Particulars of Our Royal Proclamation
here inclosed, We doubt not but they will appear to you most Just and
Reasonable, as they do to Us, and that you will, in your respective Capacities
Assert, and Defend Our Royal Rights and Prerogatives, which We are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to maintain in that Splendor and Greatness, which can only make them
Safe for Us, Supports for Our Friends, and Terrors to Our Enemies. It is
evident, We do not mean to encroach on the Consciences of any, and what
We will not do, We are resolved not to suffer in others: And therefore it is
Our Will and Pleasure, That these Our Commands be forth-with obeyed,
and that in Order thereunto, this Our Proclamation be forth-with Printed and
Published in the usual manner in such Cases accustomed; And if any shal be so
bold as to shew any dislike of this Our Procedour, We desire to be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereof by you, To the end We may convince the World, that We are in
Earnest, assuring all, That as We expect Obedience therein, and a Readiness
from you, and all Our Judicatures to assert Our Rights, so it shall be Our
Care on all Occasions, to shew Our Royal Favour to all of you in General,
and to every one in Particular. For doing all these things, as well contained
in this Our Letter, as in Our Proclamation aforesaid, These Presents shall be to
you, and all others respectively, who may be therein any way concerned, a
sufficient Warrant. and so We bid you Heartily Farewell.</p>
