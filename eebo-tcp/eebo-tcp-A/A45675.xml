         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To My Well-beloved Friends and Pariſhioners, Who do not frequent the Communion of the Church.</head>
            <p>THo' it has pleaſed God to take away him whom your Selves had Appointed and Setled here, as a Diſtinct and Peculiar <hi>Teacher</hi> of your own, yet I muſt tell you, that this Pariſh is not yet (thro' God's Bleſſing) deprived of a <hi>Miniſter,</hi> who will be ready, to the utmoſt of his Power, to ſerve every <hi>Member</hi> thereof in the great and concerning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of their Souls.</p>
            <p>It is I my Self, who am here placed according to the Laws of <hi>God,</hi> and by the Laws of the <hi>Land,</hi> and I do now offer my Self (before you make Choiſe of any other) to Miniſter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and for You, in all the Offices of <hi>Religion,</hi> according to the Order and Conſtitution of that Primitive and Apoſtolical <hi>Church</hi> Eſtabliſhed among Us, to which I am inſeparably tied by my Reaſon and Conſcience, and in all manner of Sacred and Solemn Obligations.</p>
            <p>This Church, my Brethen, is the Church you ought to Hold Communion with, Our Pariſh-Church is the place where you ought to Serve and Worſhip God; and I (how unworthy ſoever) am the only Perſon whoſe proper Buſineſs it is to Perform any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Office in this Pariſh, and againſt whoſe either Life or Doctrine, I hope, no juſt Exception can be made.</p>
            <p>I do therefore moſt paſſionately Exhort, and earneſtly Beſeech you all, in the Bowels of Jeſus Chriſt, that you will, as you ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Peace of Church and State, and the Welfare of your own Souls, ſtedfaſtly Adhere to the Communion thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:45424:4"/>If your Separation is grounded upon real Scruples of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, you ſhould certainly Endeavour to have them Anſwered and Removed; and I ſhall be very ready, and I truſt in God, able to give full Satisfaction to any One that ſhall deſire it of Me.</p>
            <p>But if the Reaſon of any One's diſſenting from Us be only Humour or Prejudice, he can never think that either of them will bear him out at the Great Day, for keeping up a <hi>Schiſm</hi> in the Church of God, and Rending and Dividing the Body of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Before you Reſolve to carry on the Separation, I Entreat You, for your own Soul's ſake (for whoſe everlaſting Happineſs I have a tender Regard) to Conſider well the Grounds and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon which you do it, for <hi>Schiſm</hi> is not certainly ſo ſlight a Matter, and ſo ſmall a Crime, as ſome People think it to be.</p>
            <p>And if nothing will diſſwade you from Maintaining the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions among us by bringing in another <hi>Preacher,</hi> I hope you will take Care that he be a Perſon of Prudence and Temper, One that will ſtrictly Confine Himſelf within the Bounds and Limits of the Act of <hi>Toleration,</hi> and who will be very cautious of doing any thing that will give Diſturbance in a Pariſh, which is at preſent in a very peaceable and quiet ſtate, notwithſtanding the Differences among <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s as to ſome matters of Religious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; as to which alſo I moſt humbly Beſeech God, in his due time, to Unite Us.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Cannot expreſs how, much I am concern'd, that the PAPER which I ſent among you upon ſo Chriſtian an Errand, and the Meſſage it contain'd, expreſſed in ſo inoffenſive and obliging a manner, and writ with that Sincerity and Purity of Intention, as if I had been immediately to have Anſwered for it at the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Tribunal of Heaven: I cannot I ſay, expreſs my Concern, that ſuch a Paper as this ſhould be ſo far from having any good Effect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe it was ſent to, as to exaſperate them againſt it, its Author, and the Church, into whoſe Communion its buſineſs was to invite them, to ſo high a degree, that <hi>when I laboured for Peace, and ſpake unto them thereof, they made themſelves ready for Battle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Reflections and uncharitable Cenſures which have been made upon me, either upon the Account of this, or any other Matter, I do moſt heartily forgive them, and humbly beſeech God to do ſo too; and alſo to ſupport me with Courage and Patience under all the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and Contempt which I have already, and muſt expect to meet with, even in the Diſcharge of my Duty: And this is all the Return I ſhall make to them.</p>
            <p>But foraſmuch as my kind Invitation to you is Anſwered, not by <hi>an humble and modeſt Excuſe of your ſelves,</hi> but by a <hi>Paper which is ſtuffed with falſe Accuſations of our Church,</hi> and uncharitable Cenſures of thoſe in Her Communion, I think it will become me to endeavour, not only your Conviction, by ſhewing you how ill a Defence you have made, and how weak thoſe Arguments are, which are here brought in Defence of your Separation from us; but alſo to Vindicate our Church from the ill-grounded Charges there layd againſt Her of <hi>Idolatry, Judaiſm, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, Schiſm, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful Impoſitions, Superſtitions, and Traditions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Heavy Charges theſe are, and yet they are all either expreſſed, or clearly implyed in this Paper, and the Sentence of <hi>Damnation</hi> paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us into the bargain. I ſhall not ſtand to Examine into the Charity of the Man that writ it, but into the Arguments he produces to prove all theſe things; and if they do appear to have no ſolid Foundation, but on the contrary, to be weak and ſallacious, or rather no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at all, you muſt either Renounce the Separation, and come to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45424:5"/>
Church, or bring better Reaſons for your Refuſal ſo to do; which I believe your <hi>Cauſe</hi> will not admit of, or that however <hi>none of you</hi> can do it.</p>
            <p>I am not much concerned to know who my <hi>Anſwerer</hi> is, only I ſhall ſay, that if he had thought fit to have ſent his <hi>Paper</hi> to me alone, with his Name ſubſcribed to it, I ſhould have contented my ſelf, that the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Controverſie ſhould have been amicably debated, either in private Letters, or in private Converſation, betwixt him and me alone. But ſince he has ſent it abroad, and put it into your hands, to harden you in your Separation, and widen the Breach between us, I cannot think that I have diſcharged my Duty towards you, till I have ſhewed you the weakneſs of thoſe Arguments, by which, thoſe that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the <hi>Authorized Ambaſſadors of Chriſt,</hi> purſue thoſe <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchriſtian</hi> Ends.</p>
            <p>Whether the <hi>Anſwer</hi> I have returned be ſufficient, I muſt leave to your Judgments to determine, but that you may better apprehend the Force of what is ſaid on both ſides, I have faithfully tranſcribed the Anſwer to my Paper, according to the Copy I met with, and replyed to it Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph by Paragraph.</p>
            <p>Read both then without Prejudice, and God Almighty enable you to <hi>Judge righteous Judgment,</hi> and give you Grace ſincerely to Act according thereto.</p>

               <label>ANSWER.</label>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir,</hi> I have lately received a Paper, with your Name ſubſcribed to it, which makes me think that it is of your own inditing; and were all in it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Rule we ought to walk by, the Word of God, I ſhould have been ſilent without making any Reply againſt it; but when you tell us our Pariſh is not through God's Bleſſing deprived of a Miniſter, who will be ready to the utmoſt of his power, to ſerve every Member thereof, in the great and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Intereſt of their Souls: For my part, I ſhould moſt readily accept of your Offer, were you but duly qualifyed for ſo great a Work.</p>
            <p>
               <label>REPLY.</label>

            <p>Sir, give me leave to tell you our Separation is grounded upon real Scruples of Conſcience, and there is but one way I know of to Anſwer them, and that is, to take away the Cauſe of them; for I can aſſure you, that it is neither Humor nor Prejudice that is the Cauſe of our Diſſenting.</p>
            <p>
               <label>REPLY.</label>
            </p>
            <p>If you have not endeavour'd all you can to have your Scruples ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and removed, you do thereby ſhew your ſelves to be glad of them, and that therefore <hi>Humor</hi> and <hi>Prejudice</hi> have the <hi>greateſt ſhare</hi> in your <hi>Separation.</hi> But if after your beſt Endeavours for Satisfaction in thoſe matters which make you withdraw from our Communion, you cannot obtain it; your Caſe is the more pitiable, and the more excuſable, and I am by no means concerned at the Liberty which is indulg'd you. But to Anſwer your Scruples at ſo dear a rate, as the taking away our <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> and the aboliſhing of <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> (<hi>which</hi> you do more than intimate is the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of them) is what, I hope, our Governours will never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to; for (make what uſe of it you pleaſe) I do think <hi>them</hi> more valuable than <hi>your Company at Church,</hi> as earneſtly as I do deſire it.</p>

            <p>But if you would know, I will tell you, it's the Liturgy, or Service-book, in which you impoſe ſuch things on us, in order to Church-Communion, as the Word of God hath not required, but on the contrary forbidden. <hi>Prov. 30.6. Add thou not unto his words, leſt he reprove thee, and thou be found a Lyar.</hi> Deut. <hi>4.2. Ye ſhall not add unto the Word, I command you;

neither ſhall ye diminiſh ought from it.</hi> What will ye then ſay for your ſelves, when God ſhall ſay unto you, <hi>Who hath required theſe things at your Hands?</hi> Sure I am, to do more in the Service of God than He hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, will but <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndo us; therefore the Wiſe Man exhorts, <hi>Be not righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous overmuch, why ſhouldſt thou deſtroy thy ſelf?</hi> Remember <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> and their Company, who for doing what was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, were all conſumed, <hi>the Earth opened her Mouth, and ſwallowed them up.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now he ſpeaks out. And tho' the things you mainly ſcruple at, ſuch as the Croſs and Surplice, are more properly Inſtances of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to Human Authority than Terms of Church-Communion, which may be held by a Lay-Perſon, in the more conſtant Services of Prayers and Preaching, without joyning in thoſe things he diſlikes; yet if it be true, that the things impoſed in our Liturgy are forbidden by God, then I own, that the fault of the Schiſm lies in us, and that you have very good reaſon for your ſeparating from us. And if this Aſſertion were but as well proved, as 'tis confidently aſſerted, I would never again read the <hi>Service-book:</hi> But if you think me <hi>duly qualified</hi> for ſo great a Work, will Preach to, and Pray for you in the <hi>Mault-houſe;</hi> tho' I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to moſt <hi>affectionately loved the Habitation of God's Houſe,</hi> and the Place where his Honour dwells, and was alwaies glad when <hi>they ſaid unto me, We will go into the Houſe of the Lord.</hi> Let us therefore well examine the Proofs he produces for an Aſſertion deliver'd with ſo much Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to ſay no worſe of it.</p>
            <p>He alledges two Texts of Scripture which are uſeleſs and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, till it be proved, that we make real Additions to the Word of God. Thoſe he mentions in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> ſhall be conſider'd by and by. That which I preſume he here means, is, that the things enjoyn'd in our <hi>Service-book,</hi> being not commanded by God in his Word, are Additions to it; and that therefore theſe two Texts of Scripture are an undeniable Proof of the Unlawfulneſs of them, this muſt be his meaning, if he has any at all in what he ſays, and I think I have repreſented it with all the Advantage he can deſire.</p>
            <p>But now, if We are guilty of making <hi>Additions</hi> to the Word of God, we either do what that forbids, or Appoint ſomewhat elſe inſtead of what God hath appointed; or We add ſuch Expoſitions to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, as the End of it is thereby fruſtrated; or we make that which is not the Word of God to be of equal Authority with that which is; or elſe we give the ſame Efficacy to Humane Inſtitutions as God does to His: But he can never charge us with any of theſe. and how then can he charge us with <hi>Additions</hi> to the Word of God? for <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:45424:8"/>
is <hi>adding</hi> to the Subſtance, and making the thing <hi>added</hi> of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing it is <hi>added</hi> to; but when the Subſtance remains entire, as much after this Humane Appointment as it was before it, it cannot be called an <hi>Addition</hi> to it, in the ſence the Scripture takes that word in.</p>
            <p>But to the Argument which theſe Men draw from <hi>Deuter.</hi> iv. 2. Dr. <hi>Fowler,</hi>

               </note> (our preſent Biſhop) a great while ago, replied, <q>That if they be not miſtaken in the Senſe of theſe words, they will prove more than is intended to be proved, or than they would have true; namely, that nothing is to be done out of, as well as in, the Worſhip of God, but what is expreſly and particularly commanded. But <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopius</hi> (who may be liſten'd to in this matter, becauſe no Epiſcopalian) hath ſhewed that theſe words <hi>[Ye ſhall not add unto the Word which I command you, neither ſhall you diminiſh ought from it.]</hi> are no new Precept, but only ſignifie, Ye ſhall not tranſgreſs the Commandments of God, by doing any thing contrary to them, which is to <hi>Add;</hi> or by omitting any thing Required by them, which is to <hi>Diminiſh.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore, tho' ignorant People may be ſcared with the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Application of that of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.12, yet it cannot belong to us, who place no farther Religion and Acceptableneſs in our Prayers and Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, than as they are accompanied with that Sincerity, Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and Obedience, without which God told the <hi>Jews</hi> He had no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in their Sacrifices, tho' they were of his own appointing; nor had required them to tread his Courts without theſe divine Qualifications. But if We muſt Anſwer to that Queſtion, <hi>Who hath Required theſe things at your Hands?</hi> then I tell You (for God knows it, and we are not afraid to appear before him upon that account) that foraſmuch as theſe things are no where forbidden, We comply with them in Obedience to that Word which requires us to <hi>obey them that have Rule over us,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And if this be the Word of God, how comes this Man ſo uncharitably to pronounce the Sentence of Damnation upon us, and tell us, we ſhall be <hi>But</hi> undone, (as if that were not Puniſhment enough) for doing more in the Service of God than He hath requir'd? Why, he grounds it upon <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.16, &amp; <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>As for the Exhortation of the Wiſe Man, (if the beſt Commentators I have ſeen underſtand it right) 'tis the beſt Advice I can give to you, it being interpreted of Heat and Zeal more than needs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Reaſon and Diſcretion; which as it makes all the Schiſms in the World, ſo produces a great many other Evils. I appeal to the whole World, whether it is not properly Returned upon you, who are tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported into an <hi>exceſſive Z<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

this you muſt give me leave to add the other part of the Verſe, (which he left out) <hi>neither make thy ſelf over-wiſe:</hi> Do not (without ſome bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Grounds) oppoſe your private Opinion to the Judgment and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of a whole Nation: And, in particular, of as Pious and Learned a Clergy as any the whole World can ſhew.

            </p>
            <p>As for the Example of <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi> if it be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd, our Caſe cannot be made <hi>Parallel</hi> to it: But it highly deſerves your Conſideration, whether you are not in ſome meaſure <hi>guilty</hi> of the like Crime; which did not conſiſt <hi>in doing what was not required,</hi> but in <hi>Actual Rebellion</hi> againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> the Miniſters of God; and therefore againſt God himſelf.

A clear Proof you have, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.39.</p>
            <p>But poſſibly I may carry this Matter further than he intended.

            <p>The <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawfulneſs of this <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Garment will further appear, if we look into the Original whence we had it. Some Authors tell us, we have it from Heathen <hi>Rome,</hi> which in her Idolatrous Service did apiſhly imitate <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Garments; as it is inſtanced in the Reign of <hi>Numa,</hi> eight hundred Years after the Law.

Prieſtly Garment of our own head in God's Worſhip, is to rob Chriſt of his Honour exceedingly, and to make our ſelves deeply guilty of Will-worſhip: For had not God clothed thoſe Garments in the Law with a particular and punctual Command for Matter and Manner, they had been ridiculous things; <hi>They made the holy Garment,</hi> ſaith Moſes, <hi>as the LORD commanded,</hi> Exod. <hi>39.</hi> which latter words <hi>[as the Lord commanded]</hi> are repeated nine ſeveral times in this Chapter, intimating, they did not ſwerve one jot from God's Direction, teaching all God's Servants thereby, that they contain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves within the Limits of God's Word, and bring nothing into the Service of God of their own invention, for the Apoſtle calls that <hi>Will-worſhip.</hi>

            <p>This <hi>Babyloniſh Garment</hi> he has mighty Spite to, and to render it the more odious, he would gladly derive its Pedigree, but he is not <hi>Genea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſt</hi> enough to do it. Authors, he would have me know he has read, but who they are he is afraid to tell, leſt it might be made appear he has read none of them, or has made as bold with them at he has done with the Bible, and miſinterpreted and miſapplied them, as he has done this ſacred Book; or that, however, they are ſuch <hi>deep learned Men</hi> as <hi>himſelf,</hi> who know nothing of the matter. The <hi>Surplice</hi> is derived from ſome-body, he knows not who, either from <hi>Heatheniſh</hi> or <hi>Antichriſtian Rome,</hi> from the <hi>mad Heathen Prieſts,</hi> or from <hi>Aaron</hi>'s <hi>Garments,</hi> which were <hi>good and beautiful in themſelves,</hi> and yet had been <hi>ridiculous,</hi> if <hi>God had not appointed them.</hi> What if I ſhould ſay, ſome Authors tell us, it was derived from Chriſt and his Apoſtles; how would he diſprove me, or prove that it was not? But what if, without enquiring from whom it was firſt derived, or by whom elſe it was or is uſed, I ſhould ſay, as I do, that it was a Garment uſed in the Primitive Church, as an Emblem of, and an Admonition to the Prieſts of that Purity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, wherewith they ought to be clothed; and that we uſe it in conformity to their Practice, and for the ſame reaſons; and withal thinking it a <hi>decenter Garment</hi> to perform Miniſterial Offices in, than either <hi>Coat</hi> or <hi>Cloak;</hi> what, I ſay, can he urge againſt this? or, what Reaſon can he give why the Governors of the Church may not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe what <hi>Habit</hi> for the <hi>Clergy,</hi> whether in the time of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or out of it, which they ſhall think moſt <hi>grave,</hi> and moſt <hi>decent?</hi> Or if he will tell me why a Diſſenting Preacher goes in <hi>Black,</hi> rather than in <hi>Yellow;</hi> if there be any thing of Reaſon in what he ſays, I will improve it into one, for wearing the <hi>Surplice</hi> during divine Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>But what if this be taken from the <hi>Garments of Aaron,</hi> as he knows not whether it is or no? Why! Then thoſe that uſe it, <hi>do thereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Chriſt to be come in the Fleſh;</hi> but for what Reaſon does he ſay this?
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:45424:11"/>
Becauſe <hi>Aarons Garments were Types and Shadows of Chriſt, who being now come, they are to be done away.</hi> If he is ſuch a Logician, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to think this to be good Arguing, yet it will not at all conclude a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Uſe of the <hi>Surplice,</hi> till he has ſhewed firſt, what it was that was <hi>typifyed</hi> and <hi>ſhadowed</hi> out thereby, which is now <hi>Aboliſhed</hi> by Chriſt; and proved ſecondly, that it is uſed by us out of any <hi>Juda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izing Principle.</hi>

            <p>What this weak Man means by <hi>imitating them in their Relicks,</hi> I know not; but I leave it to be tryed by what has been already ſaid, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>To deviſe a Prieſtly Garment of our own head in God's Worſhip, be to rob Chriſt of his Honour exceedingly, and to make our ſelves deeply guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Will-worſhip.</hi> But let me a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

No body I hope will believe this Man, pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon the ſcore of his Confidence: <hi>God having cloathed thoſe Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments under the Law with a particular and punctual Command,</hi> the Jews had been guilty of manifeſt Diſobedience, if they had not made them <hi>as the Lord commanded;</hi> but being <hi>goodly</hi> and <hi>beautiful Garments,</hi> they could never have been eſteemed <hi>ridiculous,</hi> if God had commanded no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all about them And his <hi>commanding</hi> them, is I think, a good Argument, that in <hi>themſelves</hi> they were not <hi>ſo.</hi> It is, I muſt confeſs, very obſervable, that there is ſo much <hi>Humane Learning</hi> in this Man and his Party, that they can count <hi>Nine,</hi> but what if God had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Ninety</hi> times in one Chapter, that the <hi>Aaronical Garments</hi> ſhould only be made ſo and ſo, is it any thing to us, who, according to himſelf, are no ways concerned in thoſe <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>Shadows</hi> of the Law, and to whom God has not given one particular direction in ſuch Matters, but left us to the general Rules of <hi>Decency and Order, and the Cuſtome of the Churches of God?</hi> We are therefore left at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, to uſe ſuch Garments, as ſhall be judged moſt agreeable there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; God under the Goſpel, having neither forbidden, nor command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the uſe of any: If it can be proved He has, then farewel Surplice. And here I cannot but wonder, that ſince this Man joyned the Croſs with the Surplice, in his General Charge and Indictment, he did not alſo as particularly plead againſt that Ceremony, and endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it, by deriving its Pedigree likewiſe.

            <p>This old Plea for Separation has been again and again anſwered by thoſe who have writ in the defence of our Church; but, to make ſhort work on't, I will only ask whether this that you aſſert; Namely, that <hi>we are not to bring any thing of Man's Invention into the Service of God, nor uſe any thing in his Worſhip, but what he has commanded,</hi> be the word of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:45424:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God, or? If it be not, how come you to impoſe it upon us for ſuch, or charge that upon us for a ſin, which is not <hi>the tranſgreſſion of any Law?</hi> If it is the word of God, then it is either expreſly ſuch, or it is a clear Inference and Deduction from his expreſs word. You cannot pretend the former, and therefore that which you ſay; is, that it clearly follows from God's <hi>particular preſcribing the Garments of</hi> Aaron, and (to give this Man another Argument) <hi>the whole Levitical Service.</hi> The Conſequence remains ſtill to be proved: and againſt the Truth of it, I urge the Practice of the Jewiſh Church, who made no ſcruple of ordering divers things for which there was no Command, and yet they were never bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for them by the Prophets, or our Saviour. Particularly <hi>David</hi>'s deſign of <hi>building an Houſe</hi> without God's Command,<note place="margin">1 Kings 8 3.</note> or his ſo much as ſpeaking a word to him about it, was ſo far from being Faulty, that God commended him for it.<note place="margin">2 Chron. 30.23.</note> 
               <hi>Hezekiah</hi> continued the <hi>Feast of unleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Bread ſeven days longer than the time appointed</hi> by the Law. <hi>Mordecai</hi> and <hi>Eſther</hi> made an Ordinance for the yearly Obſervation of the Feaſt of <hi>Purim,</hi> without any Command from God that we read of.

There was no Appointment for the ſinging a <hi>Paſchal Hymn</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ter the Paſſover, and yet our Saviour and his Diſciples obſerved that Uſage, and which therefore will not, I preſume, be ſaid to be ſinful. Now if the Addmittance of certain Uſages <hi>not commanded</hi> was not ſinful under the Law, where the manner of divine Worſhip was <hi>particularly ſpecified,</hi> how comes it to be ſo now under the Goſpel where there is no ſuch <hi>particular Preſcription,</hi> nor hardly any thing more than ſuch gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rules as I have before mentioned, which are to be reſpectively ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by Superiors and Inferiors; ſuch as, <hi>let all things be done decently,</hi>

            <p>This ſeems to me to be Anſwer enough to what this Man has ſaid about the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawfulneſs of uſing any thing in the Worſhip of God, but what he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath commanded;</hi> but that I may if poſſible confute and ſilence, if not convince the Urgers of this grand Objection, and even thoſe who may perhaps manage it after a better Manner, than this weak Arguer has done: I will preſent to your Conſideration what the Right Reverend the Biſhop of our own <hi>Dioceſs</hi> hath with great clearneſs written upon this Subject. It is indeed a great deal to tranſcribe, but it is ſo full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to the buſineſs in hand, that my pains therein will be well beſtowed, if you will but vouchſafe it an impartial Reading.</p>
            <p>In his <hi>Diſcourſe of Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> Chap. 13 p. 176. he is ſpeaking to that Notion of Chriſtian Liberty, which makes it to conſiſt in Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from thoſe Laws of Men, that command things indifferent relating
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:45424:12"/>
to Religion and the Worſhip of God; and makes it appear to be wild and falſe by theſe Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <q>
                  <p>This Notion of Chriſtian Liberty tends to introduce ſad diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order and confuſion into the Churches of Chriſt, and will certainly do it if practiſed upon. I need not go about to Prove, that the Order of Eccleſiaſtical as well as civil Societies conſiſteth principally in the due Regulation of things in their own Nature indifferent.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath enjoyned that in the Church, <hi>all things be done decently in Order,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.40. But how ſhall they be ſo done, if it be a Violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Chriſtian Liberty to have any thing impoſed upon us by our Governours for Decencies and Orders Sake? Particular Rules being not given us in Scripture about this Matter; which to be ſure would have been, were they not left to the Determination of the Governours of each Church, upon ſuppoſition that 'tis poſſible to give ſuch as would well ſuit all Churches.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Calvin,</hi> upon thoſe words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.2. <hi>Now I praiſe you Brethren, that you remember me in all things, and keep the Ordinances as I delivered them to you,</hi> doth thus expreſs his ſence about this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Saith <hi>He, we know that every Church it left free to appoint a Form of Polity for it ſelf, becauſe our Lord hath preſcribed nothing certain.</hi> And he ſpeaks this, you ſee, not as his own ſenſe only, but as the ſenſe, and that undoubted too, of his other Brethren of the Reformation: Whoſe Judgment, were it needful, we might largely produce to the ſame purpoſe. But there is no need of it, thoſe very perſons, who have been moſt zealous for the contrary Opinion, being forced to contradict it in their practice: And, for Orders ſake, to determine ſuch things in their ſeveral Church adminiſtrations as are left perfectly undetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Scripture, (of which might be given very many inſtances) not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their Clamours againſt the Church of <hi>England</hi> upon this, as modeſt as ſhe is in her impoſitions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, This Notion of Chriſtian Liberty is ſo great an infring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Liberty Chriſt hath left to Eccleſiaſtical Governours as not to leave them ſo much as it is certain the Governours of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Church were inveſted with, who yet were bound up and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined in a very great number of Particulars.</p>

Thoſe two known Rites of the <hi>Jews,</hi> not commanded in the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> that of joyning Baptiſm with Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion in admitting Proſelytes, and that of <hi>Poſt Coenium,</hi> or Feaſt after the Paſſover. And theſe two our Saviour was ſo far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning, upon the ſcore of their being of Humane Inſtitution, that his two great Sacraments received their riſe from them.</p>
                  <p>The Texts which are chiefly urged, to prove the Unlawfulneſs of bringing any thing into the Worſhip of God, but what He hath him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf preſcribed, are thoſe in the Old Teſtament, wherein God decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth his Diſpleaſure againſt ſome of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> for doing thoſe things which he <hi>commanded them n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe Texts in the Old Teſtament are <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.1, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.3, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.31, <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

But I wonder that thoſe who produce theſe Texts for ſuch a purpoſe, could not ſee without our ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to them, that they all ſpeak of ſuch things as God did not only not Command, but had ſtrictly Forbid.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Lev.</hi> 10.1, the thing which God ſaith He commanded them not, was <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi>'s offering <hi>ſtrange Fire</hi> before the Lord; which was an Act of Diſobedience to a moſt expreſs Law, <hi>Chap.</hi> 6.12, 13.</p>
                  <p>That in <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.3, not commanded by God, was a moſt hainous Sin and a black Tranſgreſſion of the Firſt Commandment, <hi>viz. Serving other Gods, and Worſhipping of them, the Sun, the Moon, and the Hoſt of Heaven.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That not Commanded, <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.31, was not only contrary to the Law of God, but a horrible Wickedneſs condemned by the Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>burning of their Sons and their Daughters in the Fire, in the Valley of</hi> Hinnom.</p>
                  <p>That which God ſaith, He <hi>commanded not, neither came it into his mind, Jer.</hi> 19.5, was the ſame Unnatural Wickedneſs, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>burning their Sons with Fire for Burnt-offerings to Baal;</hi> and that in <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.35, was the <hi>cauſing of their Sons and their Daughters to paſs through the Fire unto</hi> Molech.</p>
                  <p>But what doth God's condemning ſuch abominable Practices as theſe ſignifie, towards the proving it unlawful to uſe or impoſe certain inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Rites and Circumſtances in Divine Worſhip, which are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly and particularly required by God; but may be truly ſaid to be in the general required by him, as ſuch are neceſſary to the deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous management of his Worſhip, and agreeable to the foremention'd Rule, of doing all things decently, and in order?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="18" facs="tcp:45424:13"/>And whereas the Urgers of theſe Texts for tire 'foreſaid purpoſe do reply to us, that tho' they cannot deny but the Inſtances of the things not commanded mention'd in each of them, are things alſo prohibited, yet they are pertinently inſiſted upon by them, becauſe it is tacitly implied in God's expreſſing them as things only not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that things not commanded in his Worſhip offend him as well as things prohibited.</p>
                  <p>To this I briefly Anſwer, that this is ſubtile Arguing indeed, except it can be ſhewed, that God doth any where condemn the doing in his Worſhip what is lawful in its own nature, and no where forbidden by him, under the notion of a thing not commanded; which I dare affirm cannot be ſhewed. And I add, that nothing is more abſurd, than' to build Doctrines upon Idioms of the ſacred Language; but this is too commonly done by the Men we are now dealing with; as I am able to ſhew in too many inſtances.</p>
                  <p>And if we ſhould turn the Scales, and argue thus: ſuch and ſuch things are not forbidden by God, therefore they are commanded; we ſhould not be guilty of a groſſer Abſurdity than they are, in inferring from God's not having Commanded them, that he hath therefore For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden them.</p>

                        </gap> for Doctrines the Commandments of Men.</hi> It is manifeſt, that that which is condemned in the <hi>Phariſees</hi> here is the ſetting up of their own Conſtitutions inſtead, or in the place of God's, and thoſe too contrary to God's Commandments. This is evident from the Context. Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>ver.</hi> 3, <hi>Why do you tranſgreſs the Commandments of God by your Traditions?</hi> That is, ſaith <hi>Irenaeus</hi> upon theſe words, <hi>They did not only fruſtrate the Law of God by Preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rication, mixing Wine with Water; but they alſo ſet their Law in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or contradiction to the Law of God,</hi> &amp;c. And, that ſo they did, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by what follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5, 6. for God commanded, ſaying, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour thy Father and Mother,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But ye ſay, Whoſoever ſhall ſay to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or his Mother, it is a Gift by whatſoever thou mighteſt be profited by me, and honour not his Father, he ſhall be free. Thus have you made the Commandment of God of none effect by your Tradiction.</hi> And next follows a Citation out of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.13, according to the Septuagint, whereof theſe words are part, <hi>viz. Ye Hypocrites, well did</hi> Eſaias <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of you, ſaying, This people draw nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.

                  <p>We will alſo conſider theſe words as they are recited by St. <hi>Mark, Ch.</hi> 7.7, with the Verſe following, <hi>Howbeit in vain do they worſhip me, teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men: For laying aſide the Commandment of God, ye hold the Tradition of Men, as the waſhing of Pots

That is, according to Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Paraphraſe upon the place, <hi>You are thoſe Hypocrites that profeſs great ſtrictneſs in Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances towards God, and practiſe in ſome external things more than God commands you, and impoſe thoſe on others, as the Commands of God, when they are only Humane Ordinances.

                  </p>
                  <p>But, what are the hypocritical and wicked doings here condemned, to Governours determining of External Circumſtances of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration in the Worſhip of God, which are not only innocent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but alſo not ſet up in the place of, or juſtling out, any thing commanded by God, nor yet impoſed as the Commands of God. But who can have the Forehead to faſten ſuch high Preſumptions as theſe upon our Church? But I proceed,</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As this Notion of Chriſtian Liberty is an enfringement of the Liberty which is left to Governours, ſo is it alſo greatly injurious to the Peoples Liberty: for it is a very highly to be priz'd Inſtance of the Peoples Liberty, that they may, without giving God an Offence, conform to ſuch Laws as oblige them only to indifferent things. And it will be an intolerable ſtraitning and confining of our Liberty, it will be a very Bondage to us, to be alwaies obnoxious to the Penalties which are the Sanctions of ſuch Laws, and to other manifold Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences that follow upon diſobeying them.</p>
                  <p>Chriſtian Liberty, according to this Notion, is ſo far from being worthy of our Saviour's purchaſing, that 'tis infinitely more deſirable to be without it, in regard of the extreamly-miſchievous Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which follow upon quarrelling with Authority about harmleſs matters, which have not the leaſt ill influence upon your Souls, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not only thoſe who refuſe Obedience are expoſed in their own Perſons and Families to great Evils, both Temporal and Spiritual, but alſo the whole Community, the Church and State too, by <hi>their</hi> means. This we all know, at this day, by very ſad Experience. This, I ſay, is ſuch a Liberty as is the occaſion of lamentable Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, both publick and private, but I am wholly to ſeek what Good can accrue thereby, and therefore we may ſafely warrant it to be no Liberty of our Bleſſed Saviour's procurement, but the contrary.</p>
                  <p>If we were well inſtructed in the Nature of the Goſpel-Diſpenſation, we ſhould be very certain, that whatſoever doth no way tend to the depraving of our Souls, and the <hi>bringing us into Bondage to Sin,</hi> (which we have proved to be the only Oppoſite to our grand Chriſtian Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty) cannot be unlawful to us Chriſtians, becauſe not prejudicial to the ultimate Deſign of the Goſpel, which is the making us free from the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:45424:14"/>
Dominion of Sin. To which Deſign we have ſhewed all the Precepts of our Saviour, the Promiſes and Threatnings, (and I may add Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines too) are ſubſervient. And on the contrary, we may be as ſure, that whatſoever is apt to hinder the promoting of this Deſign muſt needs be unlawful under the Goſpel; as all that are not blind, or do not ſhut their Eyes, may eaſily ſee this ſame pretended Chriſtian Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty moſt ſadly doth.</p>
                  <p>And there is nothing more apparent, than that Obedience to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in all things not forbidden by the Divine Laws, doth mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tend to the promoting Peace, Love, Humility, Self-denial, and the like Chriſtian Virtues: But Diſobedience in ſuch matters doth as much occaſion the gratifying of thoſe Deviliſh Luſts, Pride, Uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Contention, Wrath, Sedition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Thoſe that pretend it to be ſuch a Violation of Chriſtian Liberty, to be obliged by Mens Laws to things indifferent, if they will be true to themſelves and their own Principles, muſt not only refuſe Obedience to the Injunctions of ſuch things, but to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions alſo of ſuch things; as they muſt not do ſuch as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to be done, ſo they muſt do ſuch as are commanded to be forborn; for it is as great an infringement of our Liberty to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different things forbidden us, as to have them impos'd upon us: 'Tis a no leſs intrenchment upon it, to be tied up from what we may, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently to the Magiſtrate's Authority, do, as to be commanded what we may omit.</p>
                  <p>So that if the things which the Diſſenters now Refuſe to do, becauſe Commanded, ſhould hereafter be Forbidden by Authority, they would be obliged, in order to the Maintenance of their Chriſtian Liberty, to be every whit as zealous for them as now they are againſt them: Nor were they ſo honeſt as they ſhould have been, but falſe to this their Principle, and ſhamefully betray'd their Liberty, in ſo patiently ſubmitting, when time was, to the ſevere prohibition of the ſame things, tho' it was by an uſurped Power too.</p>
                  <p>What a ſtrange Liberty is this, which, in its natural conſequences tends to make People ſo Humour ſome, Croſs grain'd, and Oppoſite to Government! Surely it can't be Chriſtian, but the moſt Unchriſtian Liberty.</p>
                  <p>If this Free-dealing ſhould offend any, I ſhould be ſorry for it, but muſt withal take Leave to tell the Offended, that it is an Evidence of exceeding great Weakneſs, not to ſay worſe, to be Angry with thoſe who endeavour in the Spirit of Meekneſs to convince us of our dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Miſtakes. But ſuch is the Fate of Conſcientious oppoſing Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and Prevailing Errors, that it ſeldom meeteth with better Succeſs than kindling the Paſſions, and ſharpening the Tongues (and Pens too)
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:45424:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of thoſe who are moſt obliged to be thankful for it. But <hi>Wiſdom is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of her Children.</hi>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>What Anſwer can be returned to this Diſcourſe I cannot ſee; but if, notwithſtanding all that can be ſaid, theſe Men will ſtill perſiſt in it, <hi>as their modeſt and humble</hi> Opinion that the Biſhop, and all the moſt learned Men of the Chriſtian World are miſtaken, and that, let them ſay what they pleaſe, they do believe it to be really true, that nothing is to be done in the Worſhip of God, but what he himſelf hath expreſly Commanded; then I muſt ask, how <hi>they</hi> come ſo ſharply to accuſe <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> of the breach of it, with whom the <hi>Croſs</hi> and <hi>Surplice</hi> are no parts of the Worſhip of God, when the charge falls as heavy, if not much more heavy upon themſelves; who not only ſprinkle in Baptiſm, and ſit at the Lords Supper without any Command, but ſing their Preachers Hymns to the Praiſe and Glory of God; and who worſhip God in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Prayer of their own Invention, to the utter Excluſion of that Prayer, which our Saviour in expreſs words hath taught them <hi>when they Pray, to ſay,</hi> Luke 11.2. where it is delivered upon a quite different Occaſion from that in the other Goſpel. St. <hi>Matthew</hi> indeed brings in our Saviour delivering this Paper, as a Pattern to ſquare ours by; but St. <hi>Luke</hi> as an expreſs Form of Words, which when we pray,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.9.</note> we are punctually to make uſe of. But ſtrange as it is! theſe Men, who would be thought the moſt ſanctified Perſons of the place they live in, will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther implicitely own themſelves ſo wicked as not to be fit to uſe this Prayer, than admit of ſuch an undeniable Argument as that is of the Lawfulness of a <hi>ſet Form</hi> which I muſt confeſs, I wonder this Man I am now dealing with, took no Notice of. But I conclude from his ſilence herein, that their real Opinion is, that thoſe Invectives which they ſo commonly uſe againſt Forms of Prayer in general, and ours in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, are only fit to amuſe ignorant people with, and not well enough grounded to be openly defended, though they help to keep up a Party. Since there fore he durſt ſay nothing about this, I paſs it by, and if there be any well-meaning people among you, that are diſatisfied therein, I refer you to thoſe two unanſwerable Treatiſes writ by Dr. <hi>Scott</hi> in Vindication of publick Forms, and to Dr. <hi>Beveridges</hi> Sermon upon that Subject, to convince you of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs and Excellency of our Common Prayer.</hi> That which gave me Occaſion to mention this, was the inſtances I pitched upon to ſhew, that you not only uſed things in the Worſhip of God without the Command of God; but that (ſwerving from the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Jews, whoſe doing <hi>as the Lord commanded</hi> Moſes you ſo much inſiſt upon) you omit that which Chriſt himſelf particularly preſcribed in the Worſhip of God. How highly abſurd therefore is it for any one to object <hi>that</hi> to another, of which <hi>he himſelf</hi> is no leſs guilty; nay much more, when beſides what I have already urged, it is done with this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:45424:15"/>
of Inequality; that the Inferior who owes a defference to Authority in things doubtful and indiferent, ſeems to obtrude upon the Superior that which he would not have the Superiour to impoſe upon him. There is yet one thing more which I would gladly know of you who ſpeak ſo much of doing nothing about the Worſhip of God but what Chriſt hath commanded, and it is this: What Law of Chriſt is there which enjoyns you to hold your Meetings <hi>juſt then</hi> when the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Service of God eſtabliſhed by Law is performed? This is neither the Law of Chriſt, nor the Practice of a great many of your Brethren in other places; nor can you aſſign any truer reaſon for it, than that you are not content to enjoy your own way of Worſhipping God, but you muſt alſo undermine, and ſubvert ours; which you are obliged to joyn in, though not under the Penalty of the Law, yet in point of Conſcience and in Obedience to the preceptive part of it.</p>
            <p>Upon the ſame Accounts likewiſe you are as guilty of <hi>Will-worſhip</hi> as we are, granting it to be true that to <hi>bring any thing of our own Invention into the ſervice of God be Will-worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this being a word that you often make uſe of, eſpecially in your Calumniating of us, I will venture to give you the Meaning of it, that you may both underſtand it, and know how rightly to apply it. This word is not uſed above once in the whole Bible, and that by St. <hi>Paul, Col.</hi> 2.23. and therefore he muſt be his own Interpreter, and we muſt fetch the Meaning of the Expreſſion from the Matter wherewith it is connected. If you look a little back in that Chapter, you will find the Apoſtle for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids worſhipping of Angels, <hi>verſe</hi> 18, and then he ſpeaks againſt ſuch ſuperſtitious people, as made it unlawful to Marry, to eat ſome kind of Meats, to touch or come near ſome things, none of which God hath made ſinful, but they were the meer Commandments of Men, <hi>verſe</hi> 21, 22. Now thoſe that were of this Humour he immediately after, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. charges with <hi>Will-woſhip.</hi> So that according to the Judgement of the Learned (which I hope I may have the Liberty of quoting as well as my Antagoniſt.) A <hi>Will-worſhip</hi> is erected, when either the Worſhip due to God is given to a Creature, or when any thing is ſo enjoyned to be done, or not to be done, as if it were the Will and Commandment of God, when it is a meer Conſtitution of the Will of Man.</p>
            <p>Having now found out what <hi>Will-worſhip</hi> is, let us impartially exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine who are moſt guilty of it, You or We. And becauſe I may be thought partial in this Enquiry, or however not duly qualified to make it, let the learned Man (now a Reverend Father of our Church) that aſſiſted us in finding out the Meaning of <hi>Will-worſhip,</hi> ſtate the Caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us, and let us on both ſides reſt ſatisfied in his Determination. He is ſpeaking to a Perſon of the ſame Kidney with the Man that has enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me in all this trouble, and thus diſcourſes him.</p>

               <q>I am ſure you will not make us guilty of the firſt ſort of Will-worſhip, becauſe none are more againſt it than we. As for the ſecond, Our
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:45424:15"/>
Church hath declared to all the World that none of thoſe things you boggle at, are impoſed under the Notion of neceſſary, or religious in themſelves, or as commanded by God; but are of an Indifferent Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and only uſed as decent and comely in the Judgment of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Governours, who can alter theſe things, and conſtitute ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe in their room, if they ſee it fit;<note place="margin">Preface to the Com.

But then, as our Church is not guilty of Will-worſhip in the Apoſtles ſence; ſo, on the other ſide I know not how to excuſe thoſe from that very guilt, who oppoſe what is ordained among us as unlawful, and forbid us to uſe thoſe Rites and Orders, becauſe ſinful things. For they make that to be neceſſary to be forborn and left undone, which God hath not made ſo, but left indifferent; and ſo they in effect, condemn thoſe as ſinners whom God acquits from all blame. As thoſe in the Apoſtles Diſcourſe, ſaid, <hi>Touch not, Taſte not, Handle not,</hi> ſo you ſay, <hi>Knees not, Pray not by a Form, Wear not a Surplce,</hi> &amp;c. Now ſince you think (as thoſe Men did) to pleaſe God by not doing thoſe things which he hath no where for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden; I do not ſee but you commit the very fault which the Apoſtle reproves, i. e. you make that neceſſary not to be done, (if we will be true Worſhippers of God) which he hath not made neceſſary not to be done, but left us at Liberty to do it if we pleaſe. By which means you make a Religion of your own, and ſtudy to honour God by abſtaining from theſe things, by which he never ſaid that he was diſhonoured. O that all tender Conſciences would ſeriouſly conſider this; for they would ſoon diſcern that your Miniſters by forbidding thoſe things now in diſpute, lay greater Burthens upon the Conſciences of their Brethren, and clog them with more duties, than God hath laid upon them. Whereas we, who think thoſe things may be done, lay no other Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then upon the Conſcience than what God himſelf hath laid; which is, to obey our Governours in all things, wherein he himſelf hath not bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den us to do the contrary.</q>

But the ſaying, that there is a Verſe <hi>added</hi> to the 14th Pſalm, is a notorious Falſhood; there are only theſe words, <hi>I will praiſe the Name of the Lord moſt Higheſt;</hi> which are in the ſeventh Pſalm, and the laſt Verſe.</p>
            <p>What then can this Man be thought to mean? Would he inſinuate, that theſe <hi>Additions</hi> are Inventions of our own, or that they are inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Church, upon ſome wicked ſelfiſh deſign? I hope it appears that they were not, nor we, upon the ſcore thereof, obnoxious to the Penalty of <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.2, before quoted by him. But I would fain know whether they are not deeply guilty of the Crime they charge us with, who teach, That nothing is to be uſed in the Worſhip of God, but what is preſcribed by God himſelf; for if that be not a Scripture Truth, then what an Addition is this? Do not they who teach this for a Scripture-Rule and Precept, impoſe upon Mens Conſciences as much as Papiſts, and like them and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old, teach the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Men for the Doctrines of God? Nay, is not this directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Goſpel it ſelf,<note place="margin">1 John 3.4.

            <p>In a word, I may ſay of all the Ceremonies in the Service Book, as one of your own Church ſaith of the Succeſſion of Church-Officers, and in particular that of Biſhops: He tells us, That our Engliſh Biſhops received their Orders in the Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>ergo</hi> they had as good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as any of the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> they muſt needs be as good when they are the ſame: But 'tis but a weak Proof for the Succeſſion of their Biſhops, when they muſt go to <hi>Rome</hi> for it.</p>

            <p>One would think it were high time for you to have done with this old Accuſation of Popery, and that you ſhould have more Prudence, than to give us Occaſion to upbraid you with your fawning upon, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:45424:16"/>
ſneaking to it in the late Reign, while the Biſhops and Clergy of our Church made ſuch a brave and vigorous Defence againſt it, even to the hazard of their ALL. If indeed it be true, that our <hi>Biſhops received their Orders in the Church of</hi> Rome, then his <hi>[ergo]</hi> is good, and the only good one he has made in this Paper, and the Argument is a good one againſt the Papiſts, and no <hi>weak one</hi> neither <hi>for the Succeſſion of Church-Officers</hi> againſt you, if you pretend to impugn it; which if you do, it lies at your door to prove a failure in their <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> ſince our <hi>Biſhops</hi> are in poſſeſſion of their Authority. He ought to have quoted his Author, for a Reaſon before mention'd. But, what if it be true, is therefore Epiſcopacy unlawful, or the <hi>Succeſſion of our Biſhops</hi> not good? He may as well argue, that the Water is not good, or comes not from the Fountain-head, becauſe the Conduit thro' which it is convey'd is faulty. But ſince this Man queſtions the <hi>Succeſſion of our Biſhops,</hi> and upbraids us with having <hi>our Orders from the Church of</hi> Rome, it is but reaſonable to demand, Whether your Preachers have any Orders at all? and if they have, Whence they had them, and thro' what Channel they were convey'd down to them; and whether you have any Arguments to urge for the Validity of <hi>Their</hi> Orders, which we cannot with much more reaſon make uſe of to prove the Goodneſs of <hi>Ours?</hi> But we may ſee how far Envy and Malice will ſometimes make People overſhoot themſelves. This Man, rather than not ſend forth his Bolt at our Biſhops and Clergy, will ſtrike at the whole Reformation, and call in Queſtion the Validity of the Orders of all the Reformed Churches: of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> himſelf, nay, even the Authority of their <hi>own Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for our Ceremonies, tho' they be ſuperſtitiouſly abuſed by the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts,</hi> yet that is no Argument againſt the preſent uſe of them in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> who retains them not becauſe they are of <hi>Rome,</hi> but of an Ancienter date than that now corrupted Church; and if they are therefore unlawful, becauſe they are uſed by her, then every thing done in that Church is ſo, which, I ſuppoſe, you will not ſay. We only reformed from the Errors and Corruptions of that Church, and not from what was Apoſtolical, Primitive, and Innocent, becauſe they uſed it. And whatever Opinion theſe People would have others entertain of them, yet their admired Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> declares in expreſs words, that <hi>He would not have any Man think him ſo Auſtere, or bound up, as to forbid a Chriſtian, without any Exception, to accommodate himſelf to the</hi> Papiſts <hi>in any Ceremony or Obſervance; for,</hi> ſays he further, <hi>it is not my Purpoſe to condemn any thing but what is clearly evil, and openly vicious.</hi> But for a full Anſwer to all you Object againſt us upon this ſcore, I refer you to the Caſe of Symbolizing with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by Dr. <hi>Eowler,</hi> our preſent Biſhop, where he quotes thoſe very words of Mr. <hi>Calvin.</hi>

            <p>I have obſerved but very little Coherence in any part of this Paper, but I ſee none at all in this Clauſe; on the contrary, the very deſign of <hi>chuſing another Miniſter</hi> is a Proof beyond denial of your <hi>Deſire of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> Your <hi>Reformation</hi> was the drift of my <hi>Paper,</hi> and 'tis Nonſenſe for you to retort it upon us, till you have given ſome better Proofs, that there are really ſuch Faults in the Conſtitution of our Church, as ought to be amended. But if the <hi>Reformation</hi> you deſire be as to Matters which you either have proved, or can prove, to be really evil, I doubt not but the next Convocation that ſits will readily gratifie you herein; nay, I verily think that they would take away ſome of thoſe Ceremonies you ſcruple, or however leave the Uſe of them to every ones liberty, as the Canons of 40 have done, <hi>Bowing towards the East;</hi> if you could ſecure them againſt the evil Conſequences of unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Alterations; or give them ſufficient Grounds to believe that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> of this Kingdom would then <hi>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchurch</hi> us, or however lay us open to all manner of Confuſion, it is unreaſonable you ſhould be complied with, and you do thereby plainly ſhew your <hi>Deſires</hi> to be either after <hi>Aſcendency over us,</hi> or <hi>Separation from us.</hi> Of which another Evidence is, that you uſe no Endeavours to get your ſelves ſatiſfied of the Lawfulneſs of joyning in our Worſhip. You only read Books, and hear Perſons of one ſide. You are full of Prejudice againſt us, and are glad of any Pretence to ſeparate from us. You cry out againſt the Common-prayer, but pray let me ask you, and anſwer it to your Conſciences, Have you ever ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and impartially read and examin'd that Book? Have you a deſire to hold Communion with us, if you could perſwade your ſelves that you might lawfully do it? Have you propoſed your Scruples to the Divines of our Church? or, Have you read what they have written
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:45424:17"/>
in order to your ſatisfaction? If you have done all theſe things, then you have acted fairly. But then let me ask again, Have you met with any of your own Teachers, that are able to give a ſufficient Anſwer to their Arguments? They may poſſibly put you off with Noiſe and Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour inſtead of true Reaſon; but certain it is, they have none of them yet anſwer'd thoſe excellent things that have been writ in the defence of our Church. If they think their Cauſe ſo good, and themſelves able to defend it, let them try their Skill at Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi>'s Eccleſiaſtical Polity, and the ſeveral Treatiſes writ by our Divines in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, not above two of which were ever anſwer'd; but thoſe Anſwers were Replied to, without ever a Rejoinder; ſome or all of which I would have thoſe among you, that have Time and Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for it, to peruſe, particularly thoſe that I have already had, or ſhall have, occaſion to mention or refer to, as alſo a <hi>Perswaſive to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the Church of England,</hi> by the late Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter;</hi> and <hi>The Caſe of Indifferent Things,</hi> by the preſent Biſhop of that Dioceſs; The Diſcourſes about <hi>Conſcience, and a Scrupulous Conſcience,</hi> by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Calamy;</hi> wherein you will be inform'd how far that Pretence will and will not bear you out in your <hi>Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Our Church is freed from the Imputation of <hi>Popery</hi> by Dr. <hi>Hooper,</hi> and all your Objections againſt the <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> anſwer'd by Dr. <hi>Clag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gett</hi> and Dr. <hi>Comber;</hi> which latter has largely and devoutly Explain'd and Paraphras'd upon every part of it.

            <p>Sir, as for your accuſing us of Schiſm, the keeping it up in the Church of God, and rending and dividing the Body of Chriſt, and all for ſeparating from thoſe Errors the Church is guilty of, from which we have a Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſeparate our ſelves; <hi>Come out from amongſt them,</hi> ſaith the Lord, and <hi>touch not the Unclean thing, and I will receive you;</hi> now <hi>whether it be right to obey GOD or Man judge ye.</hi> Now, if you can make it appear that it is Schiſm to obey GOD rather than Man, and that
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:45424:18"/>
it's a rending and dividing the Body of Chriſt, when we contend but for the pure Adminiſtration of his Ordinances according to his own Appointment. Now if you can prove this, I will yield you the Cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <label>REPLY.</label>
            </p>
            <p>Your ſaying that <hi>I accuſed you of Schiſm, the keeping it up in the Church of God, and rending and dividing the Body of Chriſt,</hi> is falſe, I did not poſitively charge you therewith. I ſignified to you the Guilt and Danger of that Crime, that you might take care not to incurr ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by <hi>ſeparating upon Humor or Prejudice, without juſt Grounds and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I was purpoſely thus cautions in expreſſing my ſelf, that I might not baffle my own Deſign, by ſaying any thing that might diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige or exaſperate Perſons whom I had ſome Grounds to ſuſpect were <hi>ſelf will'd,</hi> and too inclinable to be <hi>ſoon angry;</hi> but ſince you will force me to ſpeak out, I'll tell you my Mind freely; and becauſe this Man ſeems to exult in vindicating you from that Charge, and ſays it wholly upon us, I will endeavour to make it appear, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing he has ſaid, you are <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> ſtill.</p>
            <p>That therefore which I do ſay, and for which I have both good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and good Authority, is this, that foraſmuch as you withdraw your Communion from that Church (that I mean to which I invited you) with which you lawfully may, and with which therefore you ought to communicate, you cannot be excuſed from the Sin of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> at leaſt as to the <hi>Matter and Outward Act</hi> of it; becauſe, where-ever there is an Actual Separation from a Church with which we ought, and with which we may lawfully communicate, there is an Actual Schiſm commenced, let the Pretence for the Separation be what it will. How far you are chargable before God with the <hi>formal Guilt</hi> of Schiſm, I know not, I muſt leave that to your Conſciences and the Searcher of Hearts, who knows whether your Separation be occaſion'd through the fault of your Wills, or the weakneſs of your Underſtandings; whether through Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or Humor, or Intereſt, or from the misfortune of your Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as to Education, or any other matter: I hope the beſt, and judge as charitably as I can, and that is as charitably as any Man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. This was, and this is ſtill my real Opinion, and there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſaid in your <hi>Paper</hi> to induce me to alter it; for, unleſs the <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors</hi> you <hi>separate from</hi> be ſuch as make Communion abſolutely unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, you can never produce a <hi>Command</hi> to withdraw your Communion from the National Church, where the Divine Providence hath placed you, and eſpecially from that Church wherein you were born and baptiz'd. That 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17, which you pretend as a <hi>Command,</hi> will not ſtand you in the leaſt ſtead, till you have proved our Service to
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:45424:18"/>
be Idolatrous, and we Unbelievers, of whom you will find that the Apoſtle ſpeaks, if you will but look to <hi>v.</hi> 14, and as the Margin di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects you to <hi>Iſa.</hi> 52.11, whence theſe words are cited, where the Prophet bids the whole Body of the <hi>Jews</hi> to fly out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and therefore it muſt be ſomething worſe than groſs Ignorance to apply it to ſuch a Separation as you are in.</p>
            <p>I doubt not but the <hi>Errors</hi> (as you call them) mentioned in this Paper, are thought by you to be the greateſt of any in our Church, and yet even theſe have been abundantly vindicated from that Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and Chriſt's own <hi>Ordinances are Adminiſtred</hi> by us, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Inſtitution, without any ſuch Defect or Addition, as alters their Nature, and deſtroys their Vertue. And what purer <hi>Adminiſtration and Ordinances</hi> Men would have, than thoſe of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's own Inſtitution, without any corrupt and ſinful Mixtures to ſpoil their Vertue and Efficacy, I cannot tell; nor durſt this Man po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively ſay in his Paper, that Chriſt's <hi>Ordinances</hi> are not thus <hi>purely Adminiſtred</hi> by us, notwithſtanding his ſly and malicious Inſinuation to the contrary. But granting, that in the <hi>Adminiſtration of Chriſt's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances</hi> there be ſome particular Modes and Rites accompanying them, which are not commanded in the Goſpel; if they are ſuch as do not deſtroy the Efficacy, or alter the Nature of the <hi>Ordinance,</hi> they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be pretended unlawful, or the <hi>Ordinance</hi> ever the leſs <hi>purely Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred,</hi> becauſe the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawfulneſs</hi> of any thing depends upon its being <hi>forbidden,</hi> and the <hi>Purity of Divine Adminiſtrations</hi> upon their <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> with the Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>Thus the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper is adminiſtred exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Inſtitution of our Bleſſed Saviour, and becauſe it is the moſt ſolemn part of Chriſtian Worſhip, and deliver'd to the Receiver with a moſt devout and affectionate Prayer, that <hi>the Body and Blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which was given and ſhed for him</hi> may <hi>preſerve his Body and Soul unto Everlaſting Life,</hi> and therefore requires the utmoſt Devotion and Reverence of both Soul and Body, it is order'd to be received <hi>kneeling.</hi> Thus alſo is Baptiſm purely Adminiſtred, and after the Perſon is baptized, and ſolemnly received into Chriſt's Church, he is ſigned with the Sign of the Croſs, <hi>in tok<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>icitly</hi> in the Infant's Name, to make that Vow and Stipulation which thoſe who allow of their Baptiſm muſt however ſuppoſe to be tacitly and implicitly made by them; and alſo to give Collateral Security to the Church for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Education of the Infant; the deſign of which Inſtitution was, to provide againſt the Remiſneſs or Mortality of the Parents, whoſe Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:45424:19"/>
to breed up their Children in the Fear of God is never the leſs, but is, on the contrary, thought to be already ſo great, by the Laws of Nature and Religion, that they themſelves cannot be more ſtrictly bound. It is indeed to be lamented, that the Regard to this Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not anſwerable to the Piety and Excellency of its deſign, but it ought to be conſider'd, that that is the fault of the Men, and not of the Conſtitution, and that thoſe who object againſt it upon this ſcore may themſelves help to remedy it. Now if, when Chriſt's Ordinances are thus <hi>purely Adminiſtred,</hi> it be not a <hi>rending and dividing the Body of Chriſt,</hi> ſo highly to contend for ſuch Modes of Adminiſtration, which are not more Scriptural, but only more agreeable to their own Fancies, as to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from, and break the Peace of Chriſt's Church; if, I ſay, this be not <hi>a rending the Body of Chriſt,</hi> I know not by what Name to call it, and I believe my Opponent will be hard put to it to give it a more proper <hi>one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But allowing that thoſe you inſiſt upon be <hi>Errors;</hi> Are they funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental ones? Are they deſtructive of true Chriſtian Faith and Practice? Did I not know the Power of Paſſion and Prejudice, I durſt be confident you will ſay they are not; but, however, I poſitively aſſert they are not, and defie all the Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi> to prove that they are.

            <p>I had not, I own, the Opportunity of conſulting every one of theſe Authors; but I have given you their ſence and very words upon the unqueſtionable Authority of thoſe two Reverend Biſhops of our Church, the preſent Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Chicheſter.</hi> The former whereof, in his <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nreaſonableneſs of Separation,</hi> hath with great Evidence proved, that all the Old Non-conformiſts did think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound in Conſcience to communicate with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and did look upon Separation from it to be a ſin, notwithſtanding the Corruptions they ſuppoſed to be in it. And the latter, in his Caſe of Lay-Communion, produces the concurrent Teſtimony of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Non-conformiſts, that there is nothing required in the Parochial Communion of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that can be a ſufficient reaſon for Separation from it; and though he has collected the ſence of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yet you may believe him, when he tells you, that for <hi>One Hundred,</hi> he could eaſily have produced <hi>Two,</hi> if the Cauſe were to go by the Poll. Theſe Reverend Authors do not put their Readers off with only telling 'em, that the Learned obſerve, and ſome Authors ſay ſo and ſo; but they quote Book and Page, and which therefore, if you have a Mind to be further ſatisfied, you your Selves may conſult. Thoſe Non-confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Miniſters might probably be under ſuch Prior Engagements, or diſlike ſome things ſo far, that they could not ſatisfie themſelves in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Declarations and Subſcrpitions which are required of Miniſters, in order to preſerve the Peace of the Church, and the unity of Chriſtians, which does ſo much depend upon that of its Officers and Teachers. But there being no Declarations or Subſcriptions required of the People, nor any thing more, than to attend upon, and joyn in the Worſhip practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and allowed in the Church, they, according to the Doctrine of thoſe Gentlemen, ought not to ſeparate. To which I ſhall not need to add any more, than that remarkable Annotation of the Reverend Mr. <hi>Pool,</hi> upon <hi>Luke</hi> 2.41. <hi>One thing,</hi> ſays He, <hi>there is obſervable: The</hi> Phariſees <hi>and</hi> Scribes <hi>and</hi> Prieſts <hi>had in thoſe days much corrupted the Worſhip of God by their Traditions, yet they retained the Subſtance of Gods Inſtitution: We find both our Saviour and his Diſciples, and other people of God not wholly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking the Jewiſh Church becauſe of its Corruptions: Yet we cannot think they joyned with them in any thing of their Will-Worſhip; from whence we may learn a tenderneſs as to a total Separation from a Church, and the Lawfulneſs of attending divine Miniſtrations, though attended with <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſages which we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove not, provided there be no Idolatry in the Service.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Now I leave all men that have ſence, as well as honeſty, to Judge, whether you or we are divided from the External Communion of the true Church, and conſequently which are Schiſmaticks. We own all the Ordinances of the true Church, and live in the Exerciſe of them. We are in Communion with all the ſound parts of Chriſt's Church all the world over. They own our Church as their Siſter, and give her the right hand of Fellowſhip, and highly condemn you for your ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> only accuſes us of Schiſm, and the Charge would be good againſt ours with reſpect to her, if we had no better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for ſeparating from <hi>her,</hi> than the Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi> give for their Separation from <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s.</hi> Our Separation from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> has been ſufficiently cleared from the Charge of Schiſm, and when you have brought as good Arguments, in defence of your <hi>dividing from Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Communion with us,</hi> we ſhall then pronounce you not guilty of

it neither. But, till then, till you prove that ours is not the National Eſtabliſht Church, with which you lie under an Obligation to Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate; that this eſtabliſhed Church is not a ſound part of the Church of Chriſt, and that ſhe impoſes ſinful Terms of Communion; till I ſay, you have done all this; I ſhall continue my Accuſation of Schiſm, as long as you continue in your Separation; and put as good a Face upon it, as the Godly Learned of old did; who ſay, <q>That every unjuſt and raſh Separation from a true Church (i. e. when there is no juſt,<note place="margin">Friendly Deb. <hi>part. 1. p 166.</hi>

The former is, when Men do peaceably and quietly draw from Communion with a Church, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king head againſt that Church, from which they are departed: The other is, when Perſons ſo withdrawing do conſociate and withdraw themſelves into a diſtinct oppoſite Body, ſetting up Church againſt Church; which <hi>Camero</hi> calls a Schiſm by way of Eminency: and farther <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

And where none of theſe four are found, there the Separation is inſufficient, and Schiſm. Now we are fully aſſured, that none of theſe Four Cauſes can be juſtly charged upon our Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, therefore you muſt not be diſpleaſed with us, but with your ſelves, if we blame you as guilty of poſitive Schiſm.</q> This was the Presbyterian Doctrine in thoſe Bleſſed Days of 49, to thoſe who ſtood in divided Congregations from them: And, if it was good Doctrine <hi>then,</hi> I am ſure it is much more ſo <hi>now,</hi> as coming from <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> to <hi>You.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In what ſence you call your <hi>ſeparate Meetings a Church,</hi> I know not; but if you think that they deſerve that Name more than the Quakers, or Anabaptiſts, or Independants, who all aſſume that Title to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, then I muſt tell you that I take your Church to be a Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Church; for let your Faith be as right as that of the 3 Creeds, and your Diſcipline (if you have any) as free from fault, as you would have the world think you to be; yet <hi>if you are divided from the external Communion of the true Church, in the exerciſe of the Ordinances of the true Church,</hi> i. e. if you do not joyn with the true Church in Prayers, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word, and receiving the Sacraments, your <hi>own Paper</hi> makes you <hi>Schiſmaticks;</hi> and I muſt freely own, I do not ſee how any Man can be acquitted therefrom, who being a Member of a particular eſtabliſhed Church, does, upon any pretended Offence taken againſt ſuch Rites, Modes and Ceremonies, (which are thought convenient by that Church) ſeparate himſelf from the publick Worſhip, when the <hi>Subſtantials</hi> and <hi>Eſſentials</hi> thereof are ſo unexceptionable as ours are.</p>
            <p>But foraſmuch as your Notions and Diſcourſes about the true Church, and about Schiſm, ſeem to be ſo confuſed and extravagant: Before I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:45424:21"/>
this point, I deſire you will give me Liberty to inſtruct you in the meaning of a Chriſtian Church, which I am apt to believe you do not rightly underſtand.</p>
            <p>Now, among the ſeveral Acceptations of the word Church (one whereof belongs to the place conſecrated and ſet apart for the publick Aſſemblies of Chriſtians) the Church in the Language of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (of Intelligent Writers, and indeed of all Men that underſtand themſelves, when they talk about it, eſpecially with Reference to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion) doth generally ſignifie the Chriſtian Church, either as it is Catholick, or as it is Particular.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtian Church, conſidered as Catholick or Univerſal, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the whole Body of Chriſtians, diſperſed upon the Face of the whole Earth, and ſo it comprehends all Perſons, and all particular Churches profeſſing Chriſtianity. And whoſoever ſhall make a Defection, or Separation from this Church will be found guilty of a manifeſt, dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous moſt abominable Schiſm, or rather Apoſtacy.</p>
            <p>This general and Univerſal Church, tho' but one body, is yet made up of ſeveral particular Members, or Churches; and by a particular Chriſtian Church, we underſtand a Number of Men, of the ſame Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; profeſſing Chriſtianity, formed into a Society under lawful Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, and governed by ſuch Laws and Rules as are not different from, but agreeable to the Laws and Rules of the Catholick Church. And if any Man or number of Men, who are Members of that Society, ſhall, without juſt cauſe ſeparate themſelves from the Communion thereof, he or they ſo doing, are certainly guilty of Schiſm. Such a Church as this, was the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Church at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> the Church of the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> the Church of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> the Church of <hi>Thyatira,</hi> the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> the Church of <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> and ſuch a Church as this is the National Eſtabliſht Church of <hi>England,</hi> which through a Collection of ſeveral Parochial Congregations, is yet properly but one particular Church, by reaſon of the ſame bond of Faith, Worſhip and Government, whereby they are all United, and ſo make one, true, ſound, and pure part of the Catholick or Univerſal Church. Except then, there be a more juſt cauſe of Separation than you either have alledged, or can alledge, it muſt be a very great ſin to erect new Churches, and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate in the Acts of Prayer and Sacraments from the Body of a Church and Nation. For ſo at <hi>Corinth</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> told them, whilſt one was for <hi>Paul,</hi> and another for <hi>Apollos,</hi> and there were diviſions among them, they were <hi>Carnal, and walked as Men,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.34. And at <hi>Rome</hi> he bids them <hi>mark them who cauſe Diviſions</hi> and Offences, and not adhere and aſſociate with, but avoid them,<note place="margin">Friend. Deb. <hi>par. 1. p. 165.</hi>

            <p>And I muſt tell you further, that it is never the leſs ſo in you, upon the Account of the Act of Toleration, which cannot, nor does not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to exempt you from the Duty of <hi>Conformity,</hi> but only from the Penalties of <hi>Nonconformity.</hi> Your Separation is not one Jot the more reaſonable, or more juſt than it was before; and thoſe that were concerned in the drawing up of this Paper ſeem to be ſenſible of this, in that they do not urge the Plea of Toleration, but put their cauſe upon another Iſſue, <hi>viz.</hi> the Merits of it.

               <hi>But you ſeparate from a Church, with which you may lawfully communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate;</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore you are guilty of</hi> Schiſm.</p>
            <p>Or if you would rather that I ſhould put the Argument into form, in your own Words, it ſtands thus,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whoever are divided from the external Communion of the true Church are</hi> Schiſmatiks.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore you are</hi> Schiſmaticks.</p>
            <p>The Major or firſt of theſe Propoſitions is your own.</p>
            <p>The Minor or ſecond Propoſition, is true alſo, becauſe it is undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the Church of <hi>England</hi> is <hi>a true Church,</hi> and too ſadly apparent, that you ſeparate from external Communion with her in the Exerciſe of Prayers and Sacraments, the Ordinances of the true Church; whence the Concluſion neceſſarily follows, that you are Schiſmaticks.</p>
            <p>And if ſo, then I beſeech you lay to Heart the words of Mr. <hi>Ball, one of the moſt learned and judicious Non-conformiſts before the Wars,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Stilling fleet</hi> ſtiles him in his <hi>Miſchief of Separaton,</hi> where he quotes him for them,<note place="margin">Miſch. of Sep. <hi>p. 29.</hi>

            <p>I did not deſire you to take care in the choice of a Miniſter, there is no Room for that as long as I live, and I am not legally diſpoſſeſſed. But if you muſt have another Preacher, who, in your Judgements, is <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter qualified</hi> than I am, I wiſh ſtill that he may be a Man of Prudence and Temper, one that will ſtrictly confine himſelf within the Bounds and Limits of the Act of Toleration; which reſtrains him wholly to the <hi>Meeting-Houſe</hi> where he is licenced, in the Exerciſe of his Talent of preaching; gives him no Indulgence to perform any other Miniſterial Office either there, or in any other place; nor to Rail, and Revile, or ſpeak againſt the Church and Common Prayer, either in his Sermons, or elſewhere; nor to go about to ſeduce People from the Eſtabliſhed Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and their own Proper Miniſter. There is no Toleration that I know of for theſe and the like Practiſes to either him or any other, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think it is good and kind Advice both to you and him, to keep within the Bounds of that Act, for fear an Enquiry ſhould be made, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all ſuch, who do not obſerve the Conditions of the Indulgence, be not as liable to the Law as if they had none.</p>
            <p>But let him be as cautious as he will, not to tranſgreſs that particular Law, he muſt not pretend that he obſerves <hi>all the Laws of God and Man,</hi> if he ſets up <hi>Altar againſt Altar,</hi> Church againſt Church, and Heads a <hi>Separation from the external Communion of the true Church of Chriſt;</hi> and be he who he will, and let his Pretence be what it will, if he ſets himſelf here in Oppoſition to me, and that true Church of which I am a lawful Miniſter, I muſt ſay of him <hi>that he does exceedingly trouble our City;</hi> and that too by <hi>Teaching Cuſtoms which are not lawful for us to Receive neither to obſerve,</hi> being Members of the Church of <hi>England;</hi>

And a good Man cannot but be troubled at the Injuſtice and Confuſion of breaking in upon <hi>ſacred Rights,</hi> and invading <hi>Holy Offices:</hi> But however I do aſſure you, that having (as I hope) now diſcharged my Duty to the full in this particular, I ſhall give no farther <hi>Diſturbance</hi> to my ſelf, than to lament our Diviſions, and beſeech God to compoſe them, and to take what care I can to ſecure the Rigths and Priviledges, which do yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Church and Miniſter of this Pariſh, from being either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held or encroached upon. And this, as it is all the <hi>Diſturbance</hi> or indeed Incivility that I have offered you (notwithſtanding ſufficient Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) during the time that I have been in this place; ſo need you not be apprehenſive of any other from me for the future. Only <hi>forgive me that Wrong,</hi> and give me leave to maintain my Fidelity to the Church; to be firm to my Subſcriptions and my Vows of Ordination; conſtantly to uſe and (as well as I am able) to defend that <hi>Liturgy,</hi> which I have ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly teſtified my Approbation of, <hi>in the Preſence of God, and in the face of his congregation.</hi> Pardon me in theſe things, and excuſe me that I am reſolutely bent not to ſpeak beneath the Dignity of my Function, and the Station I am in; and you may depend (according to the Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities you give me of performing them) upon all the good Offices which can reaſonably be expected, from either a good Neighbour, a charitable Chriſtian, or an honeſt Miniſter.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Sir, You charge us with cauſing Diviſions among us, by bringing in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Preacher; as if the Preaching the Goſpel by the Authoriz'd Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors of God were the only Cauſe, whom, alas! you do not conſider it's the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Impoſitions, Superſtitions, Traditions, that is the principal Cauſe of thoſe Diviſions that we are among us; for all thoſe are removed, we cannot be united.</p>
            <p>
               <label>REPLY.</label>
            </p>
            <p>And notwithſtanding this impertinent Cant, I ſay ſtill, that the <hi>bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in another Preacher</hi> does, and will <hi>maintain the Diviſions among us;</hi> and further, that <hi>ſuch Preachers</hi> are the <hi>main,</hi> if not the <hi>only true Cauſes</hi> of <hi>them,</hi> thro' the juſt Judgment of God upon a ſinful People, who have not lived anſwerably to their holy Profeſſion, and that Excellent Church which God in wonderful Mercy, and by miraculous Providences, hath eſtabliſhed and preſerved among us. And I ſhall alwaies be of that Opinion, till it is proved, that thoſe Men are <hi>Ambaſſadors authorized by
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:45424:23"/>
God to preach the Goſpel</hi> in this Nation; and that there are any <hi>unlawful Impoſitions, Superſtitions, and Traditions</hi> in our Church, which are a juſt cauſe for the People to forſake their own Paſtors, and give themſelves up to the guidance of thoſe Intruders.</p>
            <p>And this is a ſufficient Reply to his complemental Concluſion with the <hi>falſe Accuſation</hi> of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful Impoſitions, Superſtitions, and Traditions;</hi> clamorous Phraſes, which every ignorant Wretch can make uſe of when he has a mind to reproach our Church. Methinks it would have been but fair dealing to have made good this Charge, by ſhewing what <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful things</hi> we impoſe, wherein we are <hi>ſuperſtitious,</hi> and <hi>by what Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we make the Word of God of none effect:</hi> But he knows, that to cry out againſt any Man of a different Opinion, is enough to raiſe the whole <hi>Diſcontented Party</hi> againſt him.</p>
            <p>If he thinks he has given ſufficient Proof of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful Impoſitions</hi> in our Church, I think I have proved he has not; and in reference to whatſoever is impoſed upon us, meerly by the Churches Authority, I ſhall only further ſay, That none of the things impoſed are Unlawful in themſelves; that to abridge Authority is the exerciſe of their Power in things of a middle nature, that are of themſelves indifferent, and neither ſimply good or evil, is to cancel and make Authority uſeleſs, becauſe their Power lies mainly in things of that nature, ſince things that are ſimply and abſolutely good are commanded by God himſelf, and things that are in themſelves evil forbidden by him; that if, where ſome are impower'd to give Orders, others are not under an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to obſerve them, Authority is nugatory and ridiculous; and, that before theſe latter days there were never any <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the World that held themſelves bound not to do a lawful thing, meerly becauſe it was commanded and impoſed upon them; which makes Obedience and Obſervance of thoſe things a <hi>Duty</hi> in us, which before they were <hi>clothed with a particular and punctual Command,</hi> were no ways obligatory.</p>
            <p>What this Man means by <hi>Traditions</hi> I can hardly gueſs. As for <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> about Matters of Doctrine, we hold none, but thoſe which are deliver'd to us in the Writings of the Penmen of Holy Writ; and for the proof of the Authority of thoſe Sacred Books, we look upon the written <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> to be a good Argument. If by <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> he means the <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> then they have already been conſider'd as far as he gave me occaſion to do it. And I ſhall only add, that I do believe what the Church of <hi>England</hi> declares in the 34th Article of her Religion, That <hi>whoſoever, thro' his private Judgment, willingly and purpoſely doth openly break the Traditions</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms) <hi>and Ceremonies of the Church, which be not repugnant to the Word of God, and be Ordained and Approved by Common Authority, ought to be rebuked openly,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>As to the Charge of <hi>Superſtition,</hi> it will moſt certainly fall where that of <hi>Will-worſhip</hi> did; and the ſame Inſtances prove you as guilty of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:45424:24"/>

When we repreſent to our ſelves the Deity, as one that is pleaſed with the imaginary Notions that we groundleſly entertain of things, this is the Superſtition that poyſons the Soul and all its Faculties. When we ſay, that ſuch a thing is forbidden by God, only becauſe we forbid it our ſelves, this is to teach for Doctrines the Commandments of Men; but to regulate Actions that are indifferent in their nature, according to the prudent determination of our Superiors, cannot fall under that Cenſure, elſe all Societies, both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical, muſt be involved in the Guilt. When we ſay things are unlawful that are not unlawful, when we prefer Human Inſtitutions to the Commandments of God, when we overvalue things beyond their own Nature, Dignity, and Order in which God hath placed them; when we eſteem the Means more than the End, and ſeparate the Eccleſiaſtical Laws from their Relation and Subſerviency to the Laws of God; when our Thoughts and Notions of things are ſo confus'd, that we miſtake their ſubordination one unto another, and practiſe according to ſuch Notions; then we <hi>put light for darkneſs, and darkneſs for light.</hi> Our beſt Performances muſt needs be tainted with Folly an Superſtition, and we worſhip God not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the dictates of true Reaſon or Revelation, but according to the dark Idea which we form to our ſelves: This is Superſtition in its true colours.<note place="margin">p. 305.</note> Superſtition is a piece of blind Service, and therefore unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable; a Baſtard kind of Worſhip, that proceeds from Puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and Unreaſonable Fear.<note place="margin">p. 307.</note> If we ſtruggle for the Opinions and Fancies that are but of yeſterday, in oppoſition to the Doctrine and Practices of the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> we believe our ſelves rather than the Goſpel, we are ſuperſtitious in the ſtricteſt Notion; and to ſet up our own Decrees againſt the Suffrage of ſo many Ages, is Arrogance and Vanity in the higheſt ſence.</q>

            </p>
            <p>So that, if either all, or any part of this be a right Account of <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,</hi> we are as free therefrom as from <hi>

            <p>And now, my Brethren, upon a ſerious review of what I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, I do think that I hare returned a full and more than ſufficient An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:45424:24"/>
to that Paper which was drawn up in defence of the <hi>Cauſe of Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> and triumphed in (even to my Face) as Unanſwerable. I have followed the Author of it ſtep by ſtep, and have not omitted to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the moſt impertinent thing he has ſaid. The cloſe Attendance which I have given to ſo ſilly and trifling a Scribbler cannot be An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd for any other way, than by telling the real Truth, which is, that I thought my ſelf in Duty bound <hi>with Meekneſs to inſtruct thoſe,</hi> in my own Pariſh, <hi>that Oppoſe themſelves,</hi> tho' with never ſo weak Arguments; that I cannot think it becomes us, who have taken the Miniſtry thereof upon us, to ſuffer ſo excellent a Church to be run down, and its Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution publickly and privately decry'd, and in the mean while ſtand ſtill, as it we were either afraid to ſpeak, or elſe had nothing to ſay in its defence; that tho' the Prejudices of its Adverſaries are, it is to be fear'd, too ſtrong to be removed, it is however proper to ſhew the Weakneſs of their Arguments, thereby to keep its own Members firm in its Communion, and to Arm them againſt the <hi>ſlight of M<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>n, and cunning craftineſs, whereby they lie in wait to deceive:</hi> And if I can but obtain this, by the pains I have herein taken, I ſhall have no cauſe to repent thereof.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Principles upon which I have acted in this whole Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, and therefore tho' you may deprive your ſelves of the Benefit thereof, by unkind Reſentments and uncharitable Cenſures of this Work, yet you cannot rob me of the ſatisfaction of having done what I took to be my Duty, nor ſpoil the Acceptableneſs of an honeſt and well meant Endeavour, with that God who neither <hi>ſees</hi> nor <hi>judges</hi> as Man doth.</p>
            <p>Where Obſtinacy and Perverſeneſs put a Bar in the Way, and Mens Judgments are corrupted with Paſſion and Prejudice, there can be no Hopes of doing good. But they who, diveſting themſelves of all theſe, are really deſirous of it, may, I hope, receive ſome Satisfaction from the Conſiderations I have offer'd, however in the Books I have refer'd the Reader to.</p>
            <p>I beſeech you therefore to reduce your Judgments to an even poiſe, impartially weigh and conſider things, and for a concluſion of all, ſuffer the Word of Exhortation from your own Reverend Mr. <hi>Baxter.</hi>
