         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:29426:4"/>
is like to prove a hopeful and uſeful Inſtrument in time to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the Intereſt of the <hi>Mother of Witchcrafts.</hi> Nor is that Objection of any Validity which may be taken from the Diſparity between the Circumſtances of ours and other Nations Laws. <hi>For,</hi> ſay they, <hi>Indeed they may never be weary of carrying on Deſigns in other Nations, where there is no ſuch care taken to root out the whole Race of</hi> Ignatius<hi>'s Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers, though they find ſome of them tardy. But in ours,</hi> ſay they, <hi>It is impoſſible for them to ſucceed any more, ſince His Majeſty has ſo proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Buſineſs home, that no Papiſt can live in</hi> London, <hi>unleſs he take the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy: And all thoſe that dwell in the Country are confined to an impoſſibility of meeting in Conſultation about any ſuch thing: Whereas the late Plot was purſued with all Industry, Policy, and Secrecy by Potent Confederates, for</hi> London <hi>abounded with Papiſts Incorporating almoſt whole Streets into Romiſh Societies: And not only that City, but all</hi> England <hi>ſwarmed with Jeſuites and other Eccleſiastical and Secular Orders.</hi> So that indeed they might have ſome probabilities of accompliſhing their Aims; But now, the fore-mentioned Alterations of theſe things, deprives them of any Means of bringing in their <hi>Religion</hi> here again. This may ſeem at firſt ſight to have ſome ſhew of Truth, But if ſearched into, is but a meer plauſible Flouriſh: For their <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuaries</hi> at <hi>Doway</hi> and <hi>S. Omers,</hi> ſuperſede all the Croſſes and Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions they have met with hitherto; eſpecially if we conſider what vaſt Contributions have been made both by <hi>Foreigners</hi> and <hi>Natives</hi> toward the carrying on the <hi>Plot:</hi> and they have had no Occaſion as yet, we may preſume, to expend ſo great a Summe of Money; and whether they be not yet aided in the ſame manner, and their Treaſury encreaſed, we have no aſſurance. This then, according to the account given by Doctor <hi>Oates,</hi> in ſeveral Paſſages of his <hi>Narrative,</hi> and the <hi>Appendix</hi> thereto; and as the Event in ſome meaſure evinces, ſeems to be their <hi>Second Plot,</hi> to raiſe Commotions and Rebellions in the Kingdom: By tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing His Sacred Majeſty's Counſels and Actions, caſting Aſperſions and Calumnies on whatſoever he does or intends; and ſo by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence they would diſaffect the Kings Subjects againſt his Government, ſuggeſting to them, that he is Tyrannically diſpos'd, purpoſing a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly of Arbitrary Rule: Notwithſtanding His Majeſty has in all His Speeches, Publick Deportments and Tranſactions, diſcover'd Intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Diametrically oppoſite to ſuch Treacherous and Uncharitable Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. But here lies the Ground of the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> Hopes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:29426:4"/>
They obſerve, that as in all Alterations of State, in Wars, Sieges, Rebellions, or any other Signal Popular Calamities, the Vulgar People are Impregnate with a ſtrange Turbulency and heat in their Spirits, which is apt to exert its ſelf in Various Pranks, and ſometimes in Enormous prevarications. So it is now in this Land: For being as it were nettled with the <hi>late Horrid Attempts of the Papists,</hi> they cannot be quiet, but are haraſſed in their Spirits by an unuſual Fervour, and this differs proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to their various Tempers, Educations, Converſe and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts: Some ſwell'd by Hypocondriack Flatulencies, preſume to foretel that theſe Convulſions in our Land are certain <hi>Prodromes</hi> of the laſt period and diſmal <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> of this <hi>Lower World;</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers provoked by <hi>peccant choler,</hi> and <hi>habitual Self-conceit,</hi> are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry with every thing almoſt that occurs, if it have any Reference to the Publick: Others act and ſpeak after another manner, all as their Fancy guides them: that Faculty (however Tinctured with peculiar <hi>Idea's,</hi> accommodate to the Genius of each Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual) being generally Regnant among the inferiour Orders and Ranks of Men.</p>
            <p>But that which is of greateſt Subſerviency to the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> ends, amongſt the ſeveral Humours of <hi>Plebeians,</hi> is the common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of their over-heated Heads to be tampering too buſily with the Abſtruſe Myſteries of Religion, and the Great Affairs of State.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But I had almoſt forgot that againſt this may the former Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection be urged, and that the</hi> Jeſuites <hi>can make no uſe of theſe Extravagancies in the</hi> Engliſh People, <hi>ſince, as hath been ſaid, without taking the Oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy, none can ſtay in</hi> London <hi>of their Profeſſion, nor can with any great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability be capacitated to make any Diſturbance in the Country. I anſwer,</hi> That if ſome Officers in <hi>Ireland</hi> were diſpenſed with for taking thoſe Oaths, upon promiſe of delivering up their truſts upon demand from their Contractors or their Subſtitutes: It is as rational to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the Jeſuites may dispence with themſelves, or their Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners now upon a parallel account, this being as well as that, ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to the Grand Deſign of Introducing the Romiſh Religion.</p>
            <p>Let it be granted then, that if they pleaſe they can allow (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Infallible way of reconciling Contradictions)
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29426:5"/>
               <hi>Perjury</hi> in this caſe to be no <hi>Perjury,</hi> but <hi>Sacramental Perfidiouſneſs</hi> to be <hi>Holy Faithfulneſs.</hi> And can we ſuppoſe they will be back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in ſending their <hi>Miſſioners,</hi> or coming themſelves, and (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a new diſguiſe of Sanctity and Loyal Obedience) dwelling and paſſing for well-meaning perſons in the Nation. Now this being granted, what hinders but that they make uſe of the two fore-mentioned Propenſions in the Vulgar to Religious and Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> make uſe of them, I ſay, in order to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing their Deſigns. For as to the firſt, the Irregularity and Fanatick Fervour in matters of Religion, it is ſufficiently Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, how eaſily the Vulgar are elated into Admiration of thoſe of their Sect and Faction, who ſeem Zealous in ſome trivial Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as it were excited by a Supernatural Impulſe, perhaps only the Efferveſcency of predominant Choler: I ſay, how natural it is for the lighter ſort of the People, thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, to be moved into a Venerable Eſteem of theſe Blazing, and (as likely) S. <hi>Judes wandering Stars,</hi> ſo that whatſoever they dictate to them is embraced as an Oracle, and being naturally deſirous of, and propenſe to the Advancement of that which they eſteem Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, they may with great facility be wrought into a deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of whatſoever may be preſumed to be an Obſtacle in the way of its promotion. Therefore here wants only a ſly <hi>Jeſuite</hi> to ſtep in, and putting on the Vizard of Holineſs and Zeal for the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Cauſe,</hi> to preach to them ſuch Doctrines as may tend to the removing all Blocks and Impediments, telling them, <hi>that it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to kill Kings that deprive them of their Liberty of Conſcience:</hi> However if they proceed not to ſo high a pitch of Audacious Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, yet to be ſure theſe profeſſed <hi>Regicides</hi> will not ſtick to wound his Reputation, inſinuating ſtrange Jealouſies into the Minds of the People: And, that this has been the practice of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and elſewhere; I think there wants but op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of reading the Narrative of the late Plot Publiſhed by Doctor <hi>Oates,</hi> to prove it. And why may we not ſuppoſe the ſame Inſtruments to be ſtirring now, ſince we find ſuch correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in the Event; every pedling Mechanick, or ill-bred Ruſtick preſuming to deſcant on the Actions and Counſels of their Prince,: cenſuring every thing either as ill intended, or weakly proſecuted, Thus by an unavoidable <hi>Dilemma</hi> reducing whatever he ſays or

does, under the <hi>Claſſis of Tyranny or Folly.</hi> This is the firſt ſort of Men whom the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> ſeduce: There are another kind of <hi>State Fanaticks</hi> alſo whom they Inveagle, and by puffing them up into Self-conceit, cauſe them to ſpeak great ſwelling Words of Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, doting on their own Impoſturous Suggeſtions as the Original Patterns of Policy; whereas in truth they are but the delirious Hallucinations of their own corrupted Fancies.</p>
            <p>And here though I have ſeemed to be general in my Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I would not be underſtood without due Reſtrickions, neither do I think this malignant cenſoriouſneſs is altogether ſo predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant at preſent as it hath been of late; miſtake not my deſign which is not to build a Rant againſt Men out of a moer angry, quarrelſome humour, but rather to prevent the danger which may be feared to reſult from the Continuance of ſo horrible a Vice as this Civil Blaſphemy is, in the eyes of all Sober men. So that I deſire pardon if I have already, or may hereafter in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pages of this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> let fall any Paſſage tinctured with too much Diſdain and Indignation: for I aſſure you, ſuch Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Terms proceed from my being ſo Immerſe in a Vivid Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the odiouſneſs of this Crime, which alſo is exploded in the Sacred Lines with Expreſſions of great Deteſtation.</p>
            <p>To Reſume therefore the Line of my Diſcourſe, it being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded that it is no Groundleſs <hi>Panick fear,</hi> that the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> are the Cheriſhers of theſe Cenſures and Calumnies which have been, and no doubt ſtill are Vomited forth, by the raſh and heedleſs Vulgar. The next thing I have to do is to ſhew the unreaſonableneſs of this Immodeſty in Subjects: And after that the danger of it to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the whole Nation, if not ſpeedily amended.</p>
            <p>Firſt therefore, as to the unreaſonableneſs of Immodeſt Haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and peremptory Dogmatizing concerning <hi>Princes Actions:</hi> It may well be preſumed, <hi>That the Myſteries of Government are far above the Capacities of Plebeians, who confining their Diſguiſitions to the more ſenſible</hi> Phoenomena <hi>in the State, their Conceptions of the ſubtle</hi> Cabbala's <hi>thereof, are like the Ruſtick Apprehenſions of Aſtronomy, rude and incongruous.</hi> Indeed the Neceſſities and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies appendant to their ſeveral reſpective Callings and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions in the World by Ingulphing all their Thoughts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects reject them into a fatal Inability to take notice of the Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral

and private Figurations, which Providence in her conſtant Inrotation makes on the Stream of Political Affairs. 'Tis true, there are ſome ordinary and vulgar Marks, by which mean Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings (though they be already as it were abſorpt by the inferiour Objects of Senſe and Domeſtick Contrivance) may yet trace the Motions of that great Maſter-wheel, that Matchleſs Engine of Divine Wiſdom, ſo as not only to be able to govern their own Affairs with Diſcretion, but alſo to make ſome ſuitable Conjectures of the Publick Intereſt: but when they once go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond theſe, they have ventured out of their Sphere, and are moſt commonly bewildered, and like Children apt to be frighted with their own Shadows, thoſe dark ſtalking Images in the <hi>Phantaſie;</hi> for being not uſed to ſee the various Springs which ſet a going the Admirable Harmony in Humane Affairs, they take every thing for a Bugbear that makes a great Noiſe in the World, and either Heaven or Hell they think muſt have an immediate hand in ſuch Exotick Digreſſions; whereas theſe Diſcords do more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hance the Melody to a Judicious and Contemplative Mind, who knows that the greateſt and loudeſt Exorbitancies in State Affairs are onely the <hi>Periodical Invariations</hi> of that <hi>Nemeſis</hi> that is by God interwoven in the very <hi>Texture</hi> of the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe.</hi> Such an One truſting only to the Calmneſs and Serenity of Reaſon, not to the gariſh Impoſtures of Fancy; is (as a conſequence of exquiſite and curious Obſervation) very diffident in theſe Matters, and indeed in moſt things elſe that are Inveſted with ſuch mutable Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Accidents: So that he does not ſo often expoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſuch groſs miſtakes as naturally reſult from the haſty and perfunctory glances of the vulgar ſhallow <hi>Rhodomonts,</hi> but with wary yet as zealous Induſtry, as thoſe that keep a greater clatter, he traces the various Minute Rivulets that ſilently inſinuate into the grand Current of Affairs: he traces them I ſay, as neer as he can to their Spring-heads, and then returning again, narrowly obſerves their ſeveral Intercourſes, Conjunctions, and progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Advancements; and this nice Scrutiny cauſes humility and meekneſs of Converſation, ſo that he does not paſs raſh and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature Cenſures on any thing, but mildly and rationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that it is prudence to ſuſpend his Judgment, in Caſes not throughly condeſcending to his Underſtanding, and ſuch certainly
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29426:6"/>
are the abſtruſe Myſteries of State, as his Experience can witneſs: And not onely his, but others alſo who have been better Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated, as one would think, to know the Myſteries at Court: and yet even theſe had not intereſt enough to diſcern the true Secret of <hi>Counſels,</hi> as appears from the frequent diſparity and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual contrariety that is diſcovered in ſeveral Narratives of the ſame State Tranſaction made by Perſons highly, yet not equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, qualified for a Commodious Information in thoſe Matters: nay ſometimes ſo well qualified, as even to have a Concern in the Buſineſs they profeſs to give an account of, and yet it ſeems one of them muſt be miſtaken. And can we think that if the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> were glad to allow Fifty pounds a year to a ſubtle Critick, that ſo by his watchfulneſs and inquiſitive Diligence, they might have a true account but of ſome of the Kings Words and outward Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour: Can we think, I ſay, that the inferiour ſort of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can attain to any probable certainty of having a true account of ſuch of His Majeſties Concerns as neither are Committed to the Preſs, nor delivered in any Authentick Manuſcript? And if they can have a true Account of them, yet how can they judge of them, ſince they ſo far tranſcend their Capacities, by reaſon of the vaſt diſtance (in Situation and Magnitude) of their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral reſpective Spheres; ſo Great, that if they were ſuppoſed to be ſearched into with the greateſt Advantage the <hi>Plebeians</hi> are capable of; ſuch as are Acuteneſs of Parts, the peruſal of Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, good Intelligence, and the like: I ſay, ſuppoſe the Vulgar to be Priviledged with all theſe Helps, yet ſome have concluded they will be able to diſcover no more of the true Byaſs, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Tendency of theſe Profound and Recondite Counſels, than a skilful Aſtronomer aſſiſted by all the Writings of Men Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in that Science, by his own dexterous Sagacity, and the moſt exquiſite Opticks, can diſcover the dark Intrigues in the Moon: though by the fore-mentioned helps he can ſufficiently inform himſelf of the Habitableneſs of that Adjacent Planet, and can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the difference of Land and Water, nay and will perhaps ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at the proportion of her Hills by their Shadows: Yet, I ſay, for all this he is not able to give any Rational Account of what is done by the Inhabitants there; but muſt needs by pretending to ſuch Knowledge, incur the juſt Imputation of Indiſcreet Folly,

and come off as ridiculouſly as the <hi>Virtuoſo,</hi> that would delight himſelf with fine long Harangues concerning the Intereſt and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of a certain Monarch there, who by him was affirmed to be Marching at the Head of a Great Army. Thus deluding him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with Phantaſtick and imaginary Scenes of War, pourtray'd ('tis like) on his flexile Mind by a Pencil dipt in the Moiſt and Lunatick Illapſes from that adjacent Planet. And this is the caſe of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable and empty Vulgar, who gaping after News, do commonly Imbibe the Droppings of the Court, though very much ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and imbitter'd with the Cholerick Exſudations of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate perſons. Thus puffing up his frantick Mind with ſtrange uneaſie Forms, cheating himfelf with a Belief, that his Anxious Soul with Labouring Steps has gone through all the Labyrinth of the State-Councels, unravell'd the whole <hi>Syſtem</hi> of true Policy; whereas, poor man! he has only been dragg'd through the Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſms of his <hi>heated Brain.</hi> In a word, it was a <hi>waking Dream</hi> which preſented to his buſie Thoughts, the <hi>KING</hi> and <hi>CO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>N<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIL</hi> Acting thus and thus, Involved in Dark and Tyrannous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues: When, alas! were the man well awaked into a due pitch of Sobriety, he would eaſily diſcern that his Vaſt Diſtance from the <hi>ROYAL SPHERE,</hi> muſt needs engage him in as <hi>Idiotick Conceits</hi> of what's done there, as the <hi>Vulgar</hi> have of the <hi>Moon,</hi> which they are apt to fancy <hi>to be a fine Bright Frame with the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of a Man in it, having a Bundle of Sticks on his Shoulders.</hi> I ſay, as groſs would be the Fancy of <hi>Plebeians,</hi> of what's Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted at the <hi>Council-Boord,</hi> were they not priviledged with ſome broken <hi>Adulterate Narratives</hi> of thoſe things; which yet may in a Parallel Degree delude them, to what the above-nam'd <hi>Virtuoſo's Opticks</hi> do him in gazing on the <hi>Moon,</hi> inſinuating falſe <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> into his Frothy Credulous Soul.</p>
            <p>I would not by this ſeem to put a Curb on Mens Underſtandings, and lead them by the Noſe into a Supine Acknowledgment, <hi>That whatever Kings do is Infallibly Juſt and Prudent;</hi> this were to make <hi>Civil Popes of them:</hi> And yet here <hi>I</hi> muſt needs confeſs, that <hi>I</hi> think as their being Men has ſubjected them to thoſe Frailties of Lapſed Humane Nature, which by a <hi>Divine Nemeſis</hi> are in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Meaſures and Degrees the Lot of all Men, according to the Various Obliquity of their Fall: So alſo that High Place they

poſſeſs amongſt Men, and their great ſubſerviency to the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Deſigns of Providence, Entitles them to more frequent and plentiful Aſſiſtance from Heaven: And the Superiour Orders in the Univerſe, if not a ſpecial Energy from the Deity, makes good their claim by Ennobling them with Vaſt and Comprehenſive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellects, ſuitable to their Noble Emploiment, and the otherwiſe inextricable Difficulties which attend on it, and theſe ſublime Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions, may be diſcovered by a cautious Obſerver in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of Princes and other high Miniſters of State, if there be not ſome Impediment in Nature, or groſs flaw in their practiſe, which laſt made the <hi>Royal Pſalmiſt,</hi> after the Retirement of the Divine Influence upon the Commiſſion of Murder, implore the Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Celeſtial Favour, that ſo his enervated underſtanding might recover ſtrength, and (to expreſs it in the common tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own words) <hi>That he might be eſtabliſhed with a free</hi> and (as One adds) <hi>a Princely Spirit,</hi> a Mind Impregnate with Illap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Eternal Wiſdom, and ſo capacitated to produce deep Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and Heroick Actions befitting his Royal Dignity, and ſuitable to the vaſt and otherwiſe unalleviated preſſures of the State. So that this great and pious King prayed but for what he had depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf of, his former illuminations from Heaven. And truly it ſeems very Congruous, that the Myſterious Whiſpers of the Inviſible World, are in a more intimate manner communicated to Pious Princes, whoſe Immenſe Minds cannot but by their ever active and ſtrong Vibrations (like Uniſons in Muſick) ſnatch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Sympathy ſome Courteous Angel, who <hi>(Deo favente)</hi> holding back the Veil, muſt needs degurgitate upon them full and penetrant Coruſcations from the Abyſs of that otherwiſe Inacceſſible Light: Thus tincturing their Counſels and Actions with that Wiſdom that may render them weighty and unſophiſticate. But leſt I ſhould incur the Imputation of <hi>Roſicrucian vanity,</hi> in thus pompouſly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing Divine Illumination to the Miniſtery of Angels; I will crave leave to digreſs a word or two to prove my Aſſertion: It will be eaſily granted I hope, that if many of the Prophets were Illuminated in this manner in the Old Teſtament, God has not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novated the Circumſtances of this Favour in the New: But that in many caſes, I do not ſay in all, Divine Light may be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to men by the hands of Angels.

               </gap>, as well as the former, and that Title onely belonged to thoſe Favourites of Heaven, whoſe Souls (if not obnubilated with Vice) were permitted to bask under the more Glorious Irradiations of Divine Light: And this, I ſay, was, and upon the ſame tearms is ſtill, the Priviledge of Kings as well as of Prieſts and Prophets. And conſequently it is very Irrational for ordinary ignorant <hi>Plebeians,</hi> whoſe Domeſtick mean Imployments could never permit them to cultivate their Underſtandings with any other knowledge, ſave what they have gained by Experience, in their trivial Converſe with men of the ſame Rank with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſome few Superficial Obſervations concerning the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick: It is irrational, I ſay, and argues much ſelf-conceit in them, when they take upon them ſo boldly and raſhly to cenſure and condemn the Actions of their Prince, as 'tis too common for them to do, when to better weighed men thoſe very Actions carried the appearance of ſound Policy and ſedulous care for the Publick: and if they did not ſeem ſo pleaſing to them in that particular po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture they behold them in, yet even an Implicite Recumbency in ſuch caſes were very commendable in the Vulgar; who, were it not for ſome few innate <hi>Ideas</hi> and common Notions floating up and down in their Minds, ſurviving the ſhipwrack that was made of the reſt of thoſe precious Jewels in their Apoſtacy and fall, I ſay, were it not for a few Sparks of Reaſon left, they ſeem to verge exceeding near to the Brutes in their Sentiments of things, and therefore certainly it is very decorous, that in Political Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters whoſe Scheme is very abſtruſe and curious, they ſhould rely on the judgment of their Supreme Governours, whom for the moſt
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29426:8"/>
part, Heaven, Nature, Education, and Experience have bleſs'd with comprehenſive, quick, and profound Underſtandings. We may alſo take notice, that they are frequently endued with many other Gifts and Accompliſhments, ſuch as that which Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates the Majeſty of our <hi>Gracious Sovereign;</hi> viz. His power of <hi>Curing by a Touch</hi> that malignant and inveterate Diſeaſe called <hi>The Kings Evil.</hi> All that I would intimate by what is ſaid, is this, That by the Laws and Polity of the Superiour Inviſible Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, or by what other indiſpenſible Conditions of the Creation, we know not: there is a peculiar Mark ſet on Princes, they are Signaliz'd with Extraordinary Advantages of Mind, and by a more Conſpicuous Reſidence of Divinity in them, their perſons are made Sacred; ſo that by arrogant or irreverent detra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to depretiate Royalty, is but a leſſer kind of <hi>Profaneneſs,</hi> and a very ſuſpicious <hi>Prodrome</hi> of flat <hi>Blasphemy</hi> and <hi>Atheiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I will not anticipate what is hereafter to be ſpoken concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Religious Obligation that lies on all Subjects to be modeſt in this caſe; to proceed therefore in the diſcovering the Ineptitude of Cenſoriouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Many and various Topicks I might make uſe of, to Illuſtrate and Fortifie my Aſſertions, and to prove that want of Reſigned Underſtandings in the inferiour <hi>Plebeians,</hi> when the Object is any ways appertaining to Policy; as a Princes management of Affairs, is the moſt abſurd, incongruous thing in the World: the ultimate Vote in ſuch matters, being not only by right the peculiar Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of the <hi>Supreme Powers,</hi> but alſo muſt at laſt of neceſſity be caſt upon them, elſe the <hi>Order of Nature muſt needs be inverted,</hi> the <hi>Oeconomy, happineſs and ſafety of the Civil World diſtorted and dwindled into Confuſion, irreconcileable Enmity and endleſs Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> As to the Confuſion that will reſult from this Epidemical Cenſoriouſneſs.</p>
            <p>It muſt be conſidered, that unleſs the King make himſelf a very <hi>Proteus</hi> in his <hi>Counſels,</hi> moulding them into as many Shapes as there be ſeveral Opinioniſts in his Realms: he had as good do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for every one will ſtill be ſo conceited of thoſe Models of Policy, that float up and down in his ſhallow Brains, that he will very hardly be brought to yield an Inch to any that ſhall contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict him: and 'tis a thouſand to one if there be a thouſand in the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29426:9"/>
whole Kingdom, that agree in the ſame Opinion exactly; where then ſhall the buſineſs be decided? I mean, who ſhall determine what form of Policy is beſt, this mans, or that mans? Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Kings is not to be preferr'd before them all? Here is no <hi>Tribunal,</hi> or <hi>Infallible Chair</hi> to reſort to for <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> for each perſon is ſo Incruſtate in his own Conceit, that you had as good endeavour to break the Adamant, as to expect any impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial condeſcention from his hardned Soul: No! he ſcorns to be guilty of ſuch baſe Incurvation of his erect and ſublime Intellect, ſo as to cringe to anothers obtruded Notions: The King himſelf ſhall not curb his free-born Mind. This or ſomething Analogous to it would be the humour of all thoſe, who are thus ſettled upon the Lees and groſs dregs of turbulent Pride and darkneſs, whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are a little ſtirr'd and troubled; nothing can be drawn from them, but muddy, partial, and tenacious Obſtinacy, and contradictory Inconſiſtences. What is to be done in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Juncture? Where is the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> of true Policy to be found? Why in this Aenigmatical Repoſitory; every where, and yet no where: Every man would be Judge, but no mans Sentence ſhall be Authentick with other men: Here is a verbal Anarchy, and ten to one but the next Morning brings forth a real one.</p>
            <p>The moſt natural Method therefore of reducing things to their proper Order again in ſuch caſes, is to place the King in the <hi>Seat of Judgment,</hi> reſolving all to ſtand to his Verdict in <hi>Political Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi> and though he ſhould ſeem to them to deviate from <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Fidelity,</hi> yet modeſty ſhould take away their proſumption of the former, and <hi>Charity</hi> ſhould null their ſuſpicion of the latter.</p>
            <p>And now I am fallen upon the mention of <hi>Charity,</hi> methinks it is very congruous, that that <hi>Sweet Ingenuity,</hi> that <hi>Benign Candor</hi> in <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> which ſhould put a Check on their over-haſty judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Brother, ſhould much more exert it ſelf in this caſe; where beſides the Obligation of Natural Affinity between all men, there is a ſupervening and more intimate tye of Gratitude from Subjects to their Prince, to whoſe Vigilancy they owe the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their Quiet and Eaſe: and upon that account, ſhould be very tender of His Honour, by never daring to broach or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in others any Aſperſions, or contemptuous harſh Reflections

which may ſeem to touch his <hi>Sacred Perſon,</hi> and his <hi>Management of Affairs.</hi> And it is as much the Duty of Subjects, as it is an Argument of Generoſity, thus to deport themſelves in reference to their <hi>Soveraign,</hi> for the <hi>Supreme Monarch</hi> of the World has joyned in one Command, the due payment of his own and <hi>Caeſars</hi> Tribute; but certainly his own would not in his eſteem be diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, eſpecially that part of it which conſiſts in a reverent Behaviour and Uſage of all things belonging to him, ſhould men be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually grumbling and quarrelling at the Inſcrutable Methods of his Providence in Governing the World; and becauſe they could not comprehend throughly its profound Intrigues: therefore they ſhould upon ſome ſeeming Exotick Digreſſions and uncouth Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders of Divine Wiſdom, preſently ſuſpect and preſumptuouſly divulge their Jealouſie that God was carrying on a Deſign to gull all Mankind into horrible Servitude and Miſery: Whereas theſe miſtaken Symptoms of ſuch a Plot, were only the reſerved Traces of the <hi>Great Council of Heaven, in order to the Good of the World;</hi> only not condeſcending to the narrow reſearches of Humane Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings: and ſure it is but a leſſer degree of that cloudy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Surmiſe, when Subjects ſo impudently preſume to Snort at the Actions of their King, eſpecially in a time of peril to the <hi>Church and State,</hi> if he do not keep on the broad High-way, as theſe ſilly conceited <hi>Plebeians</hi> are prone to eſteem thoſe Models of Policy they have familiariz'd: <hi>I</hi> ſay, if a Prince does not obviate the imminent danger juſt in the ſame manner as thoſe <hi>Mighty Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titians</hi> would have him, is it not notorious Inſolence in them to defame him, and ſo contemptuouſly to traverſe his <hi>Deep Counſels?</hi> though the ſuppoſed Irregularities and extravagant deflections from the vulgar beaten-path, proceed but from a certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and fore-ſight, that in ſuch caſes the Proverb is true, which informs us, <hi>That ſometimes the longeſt way about is the nigheſt way home:</hi> For in thus ſeeming to abandon, or negligently to manage the <hi>Publick Welfare,</hi> he indeed more cloſely, but more warily withal, proſecutes it: perhaps he may fetch a larger compaſs then theſe ſlow-pated Gentlemen can tell how to trace him in; But it is only to remove ſome foreſeen Obſtacles, or anticipate a fly Machination, perhaps he may a while ſtand ſtill, when a more ſteddy and full proſpect of his Buſineſs may expedite the Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29426:10"/>
of his well-intended Aims: And yet theſe ſeeming Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and retrograde Poſtures of Princes may ſometimes ariſe from a miſtake ſomewhat Analogous to theirs, who think the Planets really go back and ſtand ſtill, when that deluſive <hi>Phaenomenon</hi> ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes only from the ſeveral Stations of the Earth <note place="margin">See the Notes on Dr. <hi>More</hi>'s Poems.</note>in its Annual motion. He that underſtands <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernicus</hi> his Scheme of the World, will beſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the Compariſon: For ſo theſe <hi>Plebeians</hi> moving in a narrower Sphere, cannot keep pace with the vaſt Orb of <hi>Polititians,</hi> and yet meaſuring their <hi>Stately Motions</hi> by the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial Ideas</hi> in their delirious Fancies, will be apt to think the others ſtand ſtill and go back, when the fault lies only in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtant Skulls, and over-haſty propenſion to cenſoriouſneſs. But however ſuppoſe theſe diſparate Motions of Princes to be real, yet 'tis Idiotick to murmure all this while, as if the Matter was in the Suds, as they ſay: for theſe Oblique Tranſcurſions and Statick poſtures, do but help to reſume his way more proſperouſly, now encouraged by the defeat of the previſed Obſtructions: In this not much unlike that Glorious Monarch of the Day, the Sun, who for all that Heavenly Labyrinth and Learned Perplexity he ſeems to be intangled in, when beheld in an Aſtronomical Scheme, yet nevertheleſs rejoyces as a Giant to run his courſe, breaking through all thoſe ſeeming Difficulties, which are only the Product of buſie Minds. Such is the <hi>Zodiack</hi> of <hi>Policy</hi> wherein Princes move, and their Poſtures and Motions, ſeem they never ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique or obſcure; nay though they ſhould (like that Great Light) ſeem to the Vulgar to ſtand ſtill, yet their Courſe is ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and regular, ever tending toward the accompliſhment of their Scope, and he that ſhould deny this, becauſe by reaſon of ſeveral interpoſing hindrances, he could not preciſely trace their Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps, deſerves to be counted as much a Fool or Mad-man, as he that ſhould think the Sun went not forward, becauſe he could not at that time diſcern his progreſs when ſome Clouds intercepted his ſight, or ſuppoſe the Air ſerene and clear, yet the vaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Solar Sphere rejected all Terreſtrial Gazers into an unavoidable inability to deſcry his ſeeming minute, though really prodigious, ſteps in the Ecliptick, according to the <hi>Ptolomaick Hypotheſis,</hi> which I may make uſe of here for the Compariſons
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:29426:10"/>
ſake, though I diſcard that almoſt obſolete Opinion, when I hearken to the Dictates of ſeverer Reaſon.</p>
            <p>I would not by theſe more Lax Conſiderations of the vaſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance between a Prince and his Subjects, ſeem to ſet up, as I ſaid, a kind of <hi>State-Pope,</hi> whoſe Actions muſt not be queſtioned or ſcann'd as being Infallibly Excellent and without Fault. All that I mean is this,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That all <hi>Political Tranſactions</hi> are in their own nature In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate, as it were Eſſentially involving <hi>Labyrinths</hi> and <hi>Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> in their very Conſtitution, but acquire a greater inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricableneſs, by the numerous and aſſiduate Contingencies that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merge from the various events of Peace and War, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That upon the account of theſe inſeparable Difficulties that attend the Management of State Affairs, none can be preſumed fitter to conquer them, and diſpatch the Concernsof a Nation with Safety, Honour, and Immunity from ſubſequent Diſaſters that may reſult from perfunctory Attempts to cure preſent Diſeaſes: I ſay none can be ſuppoſed to be in a better capacity to do this, than he whoſe very Birth entituled him to the Priviledge of being initiated (when adult) into the Rudiments of true Policy, whoſe Education made good his Native-claim, and both were ſeconded with adventitious Light and Conduct from the Celeſtial Miniſters of State; And ſuch an one is every pious Prince.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That therefore the Prince with his Council ought to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed <hi>the ORACLE of the STATE;</hi> and he who over boldly pries into their Conſultations, or raſhly cenſures their Actions, forſeits his Modeſty, Gratitude, Duty and Reaſon, and diſcovers a Mind intoxicated with ſelf conceit, hardened with baſe Unthankfulneſs, and ſunk into groſs Folly, and Irreligion: So that I might very well paſs on to another part of this Diſcourſe, were I not invited to purſue my preſent Theme more cloſely, and to reduce Matters to particulars, for fear of the ſpreading conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſneſs and regency of this Diſeaſe. Not to mention how cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly the poyſon is imbib'd when taken by men who in plain words own the Preheminence of Royalty, yet by their Jeſuitically Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Reflections on its Proceedings, are taught to embrace and eaſily learn to give to others injurious and irreverent thoughts of it, and deprive it of the moſt ſuitable means to juſtifie it ſelf, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:29426:11"/>
diſabuſe them; which means conſiſts in its being handled with that due modeſty and ingenuous Reſervedneſs, that its fore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>named ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p ndant Circumſtances require: And not only thoſe, but others alſo, which I will enumerate immethodically, as they occur.</p>
            <p>It may be conſidered therefore, that one vaſt diſadvantage ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues to the Vulgar in judging of State. Affairs from their unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintedneſs in a multitude of particulars relating to the Alliances, Leagues, Correſpondencies, and ſeveral other Tranſactions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a King and the Princes of Foreign Nations: not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his private Concerns at home, whether at the Court, or any other parts of his Realms, between him and his Nobles: All which perhaps may be extraneous to the main engroſſing preſent Affair of the Publick, and yet he muſt be allowed to proſecute them with as much perhaps more vigour and alacrity, then at that time is requiſite to the management of that other great Affair: Whence it will fall out, that now and then they will force him to make an Eruption into ſome Publick Actions, whoſe coherence with, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on thoſe fore-mentioned private Concerns not being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, or ſo much as dream'd of among the Vulgar; it muſt needs follow, that if they take upon them to judge of thoſe Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they will ſtill imagine they bear a reſpect to that part of the Publick Affairs which fall under their Cognizance, and ſo will make a falſe Conſtruction of the Scope and Tendency of ſuch A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which probably may not have any Affinity with the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Affair, but only are performed in order to the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his own private. But here when I make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a Prince's publick Actions and his private; I mean only this, that the management of ſome of their Concerns does not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſo immediate and direct a relation to the preſent great engroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Affair of the Publick, though they may have a real Aſpect on it, as to their Remote tendency, by an exquiſite Cadency of Events falling in with the Stream. Sometimes alſo they act with a direct Aſpect on the Publick, but yet their Deſign is hid from the Vulgar. As ſometimes a Prince may be Negotiating with an Ambaſſadour concerning the preſent Great Matter in Publick Queſt, and yet his Subjects may not dream of any ſuch thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> this private Negotiation may cauſe the Prince to run out into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Actions, and ſuch as to the Vulgar who were ignorant
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29426:11"/>
of what paſs'd between him and the Ambaſſadour, may ſeem exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick, if not worſe: ſo eaſie is it for the Vulgar to commit groſs Errours, if they preſume to deſcant on every unuſual <hi>Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> in the management of <hi>State Affairs,</hi> when oftentimes they are raiſed from Cauſes ſo remote from the knowledge of the Vulgar, that unleſs we ſuppoſe them not only to be well skill'd in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories of Neighbour Nations, and of their Court Proceedings, and in the Hiſtories of our own Land; but alſo verſed in many unpubliſhed Narratives, or at leaſt all thoſe Paſſages in them which relate the ſeveral Alliances, Leagues, Titles, and other Circumſtances wherein our Soveraign either upon his own or his Anceſtors account may be engaged: To ſome of which theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual Publick Carriages of a Prince may have reference; I ſay, unleſs we will ſuppoſe the Vulgar to know all this, which is all one as to ſuppoſe them of the Kings Cabinet-Council; it muſt needs follow, that they will be guilty of groſs Hallucinations, when ever they take upon them to cenſure ſuch Actions and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Deportments of a Prince: their narrow thoughts not being able without thoſe fore-mentioned helps, perhaps ſcarce with them, to purſue the vaſt and intricate Deſigns of Princes through all the Elaborate Tracts of Policy.</p>
            <p>And this Conſideration will I preſume carry greater force with it, if it be but conſidered how many of the Ordinary Paſſages and Tranſactions between Neighbours in the ſame Town are not fully underſtood by others in the ſame Corporation (and perhaps men of competent judgment in ſuch Affairs) onely by reaſon of their not being acquainted with the grounds of ſuch Tranſactions which cannot be known without a ſatisfactory Information in ſeveral par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Circumſtances relating to the Condition of the perſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned and their Kindred; Many of which Circumſtances, or all of them may be pointed at in ſuch Tranſactions: and if ſuch Dilu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidations be neceſſary to make Neighbours underſtand one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers buſineſs, though its utmoſt Aſpect may perhaps be confined to perſons dwelling in the ſame Town, we muſt needs think that the greateſt part of a Princes Affairs as to their ſcope and tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, is loſt to the Vulgar, ſince they have oftentimes an intimate connexion with things done in very remote Regions, ſome hundreds of years ago, amidſt Circumſtances to many of which we are
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29426:12"/>
wholly ſtrangers. 'Tis no wonder therefore that many Actions of Princes ſeem uncouth to the Vulgar, and their abrupt Tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the ordinary courſe of common Policy, make the ſilly people ſtart, their crazy underſtandings not being able to bear the ſudden motion. Indeed to make a man a competent Judge in thoſe <hi>Phanomena,</hi> it were requiſite that he be well verſed in the whole <hi>Syſtem</hi> of the <hi>Political Affairs</hi> of ſuch a Realm, and that he be able with one compendious glance, to look on theſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Actions of Princes, and the whole body of Political Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns together, for they will never appear to their true advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, but when they are looked on in their proportional condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civeneſs to advance the due Symmetry of the whole; and this cannot be done but by a full diſplay of them altogether. He that ſhall then attentively ſurvey the Great Current of State Affairs, and the apt Inſinuations of theſe Novel Rivulets, and though they ſeem to proceed from By-corners, yet how naturally they glide along with the Stream<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He that ſhall obſerve how the knowledge of ſomewhat done a hundred years ago, and a thouſand miles off, does yet illuſtrate a preſent Eruption of a Prince into ſome ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Exotick Diſcoveries of Concernment and care; ſuch an one will diſcern the Folly of being over haſty in cenſuring Occurrencies ſo diſadvantageouſly looked on, when irrelatively and ſever'd from the Coincidence they had with Matters to them utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; or with the whole ſtream of <hi>State Affairs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto the Tenour of my Arguments againſt Cenſoriouſneſs in Subjects, and their immodeſt Determinations concerning thoſe Methods of Policy that are uſed by their Prince, has not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether excluded them from a poſſibility of having true Narratives of their Proceedings, but only upon a tacite Conceſſion of that Priviledge to ſome of them does yet deny them any Capacity of making a ſuitable Conjecture concerning the re-cluſe tendency of all their known Tranſactions, or of defining whether ſuch a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Tendency of them be Commenſurate to the Rules of true Policy. But there are not wanting Arguments to prove that it is very improbable at leaſt, if not impoſſible for the Vulgar to have ſo much as a true genuine account of their ordinary Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Counſels in reference to the Publick: And then theſe Criticks will be inexcuſable in their peremptory deſcants on Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29426:12"/>
which perhaps owe their Birth to Vulgar Report: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they can have no ordinary aſſurance to the contrary, and therefore cannot eſcape S. <hi>Judes</hi> Cenſures, who calls thoſe <hi>Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks</hi> in his time, <hi>Filthy Dreamers,</hi> and gives this Character of them, <hi>That they despiſe Government, ſpeak evil of Dignities, and of things they know not.</hi> And juſt ſo do our <hi>State-Criticks, ſpeak evil of things they know not,</hi> which I will endeavour to prove.</p>
            <p>It may be conſidered therefore, That a great Diſadvantage ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues to theſe mens knowledge of the profound Myſteries of State, by reaſon of the many hands through which all Narratives of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces Councels and Actions muſt neceſſarily paſs (ſuppoſing they be true at firſt) before they can come under their Cognizance; and certainly they muſt loſe much of thoſe Appendages which are requiſite to dilucidate an entire true Account, by being obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Additions, Subſtractions, Tinctures, Gloſſes, and Manglings of all thoſe Intermediate perſons, whoſe various and ſeverally peculiar Intereſts, Diſpoſitions, Affections, Humours, and Miſtakes may conduce to the depriving a Narrative of its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Symmetry, Extent, Luſter and Scope, and this diſadvantage is augmented according to the various deſcents of Inferiority in the perſons thus cenſuring, every lower ſtep from the Prince, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them to more egregious probability of being miſinformed by reaſon their Converſe, and ſo the means of Information in theſe Matters, is confined to men of the ſame or a very little higher rank then themſelves. Now that a Narration paſſing through ſo many hands muſt needs be maimed, and in many things come far ſhort of the intire perfect Original, ſcarce any indeed will ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine but he whoſe Fortune in the World, and priviledges of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Education, and Converſe, furniſh him with the means of receiving ſuch a Story in its ſeveral gradual repreſentations from Noblemen and the common people, or any ſuch like diſparate ranks of men, ſo diverſly qualified for a Commodious Information in theſe <hi>State Myſteries.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More particularly it may be conſidered, how great a prejudice devolves on the Vulgar, from the Satyrical Gloſſes and biting Reflections which by maliciouſly witty men may, and commonly are interwoven ſlily in written or traditional Narratives of Princes Tranſactions: By theſe Arts an ingenious perſon indeed may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29426:13"/>
a Tranſaction how he pleaſes, even ſo as ſhall make a deep Impreſſion on the prejudicate and unwary mind, though far enough from the truth. Thus a very good cauſe may be being disfigured according to their petulant malice appear odious to the Vulgar, who have not the brains to diſtinguiſh betwixt the <hi>true Story</hi> and theſe <hi>ſubtle deductions,</hi> of pre-byaſs'd men, but ſwallow all down whole without mincing or chewing, and it goes down the eaſier in that oftentimes theſe by-blows are ſtruck with a jerk; I mean that common mode of Satyr which the Vulgar are daily uſed to, a blunt clowniſh kind of Wit, which their ordinary Repartees make them very pregnant in, and ſo the ſooner taken with it in any diſcourſe of others, whence it glides with the Contents of the Story into the very inmoſt receſs of their pliable Spirits, rooting its ſelf there as deeply as the true Narration, and by a cloſe mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their <hi>Idea's</hi> they become one: and the man is as firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded of the truth of the collateral gloſs, as of the direct tenour of the Story. One may eaſily gueſs what it is I aim at by this laſt conſideration; it is only to intimate, that it is not ſo often the <hi>real obliquity</hi> of Princes Actions, but a <hi>cunningly ſuborned repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation</hi> of ſuch obliquity that has ſuch influence on the Vulgar weak mind, as to make it <hi>ſapinely reel</hi> into baſe cenſoriouſneſs. I have ſpoken all this while of theſe Narratives of Princes Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions which have no certain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> way of being conveyed to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick notice; but being only traditional, or at beſt but privately tranſcrib'd, are obnoxious to various Sophiſtications, ſo as 'tis probable very few, if any of them are repreſented truly to the vulgar Enquirer. But here I am ſenſible I have expoſed my ſelf to a ſhrewd Objection, for I have ſeemed to make an Inſtrument with two handles, that being taken hold of by one, may ſerve to defend the Prince, but if by the other, may as deſperately wound him: For ſay they, there being ſuch lubricous uncertainty in all Narratives of Princes Actions, many of their ill practiſes will eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the knowledge of the Subjects, being painted over by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed perſons, in a fine plauſible Dreſs: to which, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent another ſuſpicion in the Reader, I anſwer, That I aim not to prove that all the Conſultations and Actions of Princes are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peccable, and need no correction or amendment; this were to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them to be men, and to abſolve them from ſubjection to the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29426:13"/>
common frailties and imperſections of our Nature: and beſides it would be a task ſo diſproportionate to my power, conſidering at what a vaſt diſtance I behold their Actions that I could not poſſibly in undertaking it, evade the juſt cenſure of the Reader; That I have unawares fallen into that ſelf conceitedneſs and immodeſty which I blame in others, in thinking my ſelf capable of having a true account of what Princes do, when the truth of it is, I am ſo far from thinking ſo, that I muſt confeſs the contrary thought in its full latitude, was the chiefeſt Motive that induced me to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture on this <hi>Eſſay.</hi> So that I do not pretend in the leaſt that I have a particular knowledge of the Congruity of Princes Actions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what other men of the ſame rank with my ſelf may have: For I muſt confeſs that many things I obſerve in their management of <hi>State Affairs,</hi> do diſtreſs my reaſon to find a ſatisfactory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, but when I conſider how many of their Actions, while Ignorance and Prejudice darkned my underſtanding, appeared unpleaſing, in which yet I now think I diſcern a manifeſt diſcovery of Care for the Publick, at leaſt of lawful and very allowable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection in reference to their perſonal concern, and thoſe of the Crown, which alſo are proſecuted in order to the Publick Welfare, when I reflect on my Soveraign as a Chriſtian, and as Signaliz'd with excellent Endowments, and peculiar Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; when I vew the vaſt height and diſtance of his Sphere: In ſhort, when I remember all the fore-going Conſiderations which ſet forth the great difficulty of making a true Judgment of their Deportment. I cannot but conclude, that common Ingenuity, Modeſty, and Diſcretion, beſides the obligations of Reverence, Gratitude, and Loyal Obedience, make it highly rational for me to check my forward thoughts that would over-haſtily venture out of their Sphere, and peremptorily judge of the recluſe Affairs of Kings, eſpecially our own moſt Gracious Soveraign, who has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the moſt Satisfactory Evidence to the World the Rational part thereof could think fit to require; that he is moſt zealouſly devoted to the Publick Welfare both of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the Objection therefore I anſwer more particularly, That 'tis poſſible ſome faulty Actions and Counſels of Princes, may by the plauſible Rhetorications and ſmooth Gloſſes of their Followers be repreſented to the Vulgar as without Crime: but then again, it</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:29426:14"/>
               <hi>ſhould be conſidered, that unleſs it be apparent that all their actions are but painted over, whilſt in the mean time they are really crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, no man can eſcape the imputation of groſs Cenſoriouſneſs that will be ſwayed by every ſlight Inſinuation either of his own ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humour, or of other mens malice, to infringe the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Bond of Charity which is in theſe caſes required between Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, and ſhould here be elevated into an extraordinary benigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and generoſity of Spirit, but would degenerate into Diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical baſeneſs, ſhould he without apparent and undeniable Evidence of their truth, give credit to every Report that is raiſed concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ill deſigns and practices of his Soveraign, eſpecially in this dangerous</hi> Criſis <hi>of</hi> Affairs, <hi>when it is ſo well known to all, and publickly declared by the Diſcoverer of the Plot,</hi> That the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites are the Fathers and Fomenters of theſe Stories, hoping thereby to deprave the affections and minds of the People, and to Conjure up the old Spirit of Rebellion, which is commonly uſher'd in by an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal humour of muttering againſt the Government, as it was in the late Civil Wars, for juſt before their breaking out, the Jeſuites had carried on as desperate a Plot, and broughe it to almoſt as good matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as they had done this laſt, <hi>1678.</hi> Only in the very nick of time it was diſcovered to his Grace the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who immediately communicated the Buſineſs to the King, and both of them with admirable Induſtry and Secrecy (as the caſe required) ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Counter-plot that Infernal Society. Now the Jeſuites finding themſelves defeated in that horrid Enterpriſe, would not lay down the Cudgels ſo, but by a ſtrange Retort of Machinations, they gained ground again, and defended themſelves beſt with that which one would think ſhould have deſtroyed them, that is their Adverſaries Weapon; for obſerving that the common people had got a trick of murmuring and barking at every little flirt of the Robe and Gown, though but the natural reſult of the graceful meen and deportment of their Wearers. I ſay obſerving this, they made uſe of it to accompliſh their Deſigns, Inſiunating every where in all Companies and upon all Occaſions, that the King was a Tyrant, and that both he and the Archbiſhop were little better then Papiſts; and that they connived at Popery; the One by not uſing his Authority for its extirpation; the Other by ſheltering himſelf under Royal Protection, and bringing in all manner of Innovations into the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:29426:14"/>
Thus did the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> delude the ſilly people, filling their Mouths with Complaints againſt the King, becauſe he did not go their clowniſh way to work, and knock all Papiſts on the Head, and becauſe ſquander'd away ſo much Money to keep up the Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and Grandeur of the Court, (that is as much as to ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he did not Caſhier Sixteen of the Blood Royal, and their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Retinue at the Court) which is the very Glory of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the old eſtabliſhed Law of the Land: Many other Complaints there were up and down the City and Country among the common people (the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> having envenom'd their Tongues) ſo that unleſs the King and the Archbiſhop had pinched up the Affairs of <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State</hi> to ſuch an intolerable ſtreightneſs, that nothing of Civil Splendor and Hoſpitality might be diſcerned in One, or Sacred Majeſty and Venerable Order in the Other. Nay, unleſs the two fore-mentioned Illuſtrious and Renowned Perſons in going about to ſtop ſome ſmall pretended Leaks in the great Body of Eccleſiaſtical and Secular Polity, had uſed the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick and unartificial hammering of theſe groſs Mechanick Sages, and ſo endangered an incurable Rupture by Stroaks ſo diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate to the exquiſite Touch of the Civil Law, and the more inviolable Obligations of Chriſtian Charity, they were ſtill mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mured at by the quarrelſom Vulgar: For thus it was, that that Malignant Spirit in them had as it were dreined from all parts of the Kingdom thoſe peccant Humours, which though but thinly diſperſed, and eaſily purged out by the Natural Courſe of the Law, yet by being united in a diſadvantageous juncture of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, ſeemed to the unskilful and raſh <hi>Plebeians</hi> to carry the Symptoms of a Mortal Diſeaſe. Thus flinging Dirt on the Face of Affairs, and then perſwading themſelves it was its true Complexion: A very clowniſh Sophiſm, and which brought its Reward along with it; for the purblind Fools that had taken ſuch pains to bedaub the Commonwealth, not long after fell over head and ears into the Mire themſelves.</p>
            <p>For this Inſolent Humour was ſo cheriſhed by the Libels, fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reports, and daily Inſinuations of ſubtle <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> who every where had their Inſtruments at work to raiſe a Civil War, that at laſt it grew Rampant, Marriners and ſuch kind of rude Fellows, the very Dregs of the Nation, would ſtrout up and down the City
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29426:15"/>
in Tumults, exclaiming againſt the Kings Actions, repreſenting him as a Tyrant, and I know not what, till at length they fell to Threats, and ſo by degrees involved this Kingdom in a moſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entous Civil War; and he that ſhall peruſe the Records of other Nations, will find that theſe Mutterings and Verbal Attempts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Government, were a certain ſtep to the overthrow of the people addicted to them.</p>
            <p>And it is as like to be ſo now as ever, if this Epidemical Vice be not amended, God always puniſhing Rebellions with Signal Tokens of his Diſpleaſure, making the very <hi>Baſis</hi> and chief Prop of their treacherous Obſtinacy (like the Ground whereon ſtood <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram)</hi> the very entrance to their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. This I mention, that whom the Vitioſity and Turpitude of theſe Proceedings will not diſſwade from perſiſting in them, their uſual dangerous Conſequence may deter.</p>

'tis ſufficient in the eye of the <hi>Vulgar,</hi> who meaſure all Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments by their own, and think him a very valuable man who exceeds them in ſuch ordinary trivial matters, though they ſlight and contemn Perſons of higher Endowments, becauſe they are above their narrow Apprehenſions; but the other they will eſteem fit for any thing, even to manage Kingdoms if need be, and their eſtimation will be encreaſed if to their natural ſagacity in ſome things there be added a <hi>Confident Deportment</hi> in reference to higher <hi>Concerns:</hi> Thus <hi>Coblers</hi> by being ſharp, active Fellows, and by a little Converſe with Hiſtory, have gained ſometimes on the <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> ſo as to be raiſed by ſuch <hi>diſorderly Rabbles</hi> to <hi>high preferment,</hi> only on the account of their <hi>loud ratling out of hard Names of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and great men in foreign Countries:</hi> ſuch <hi>Pedantick Tricks</hi> have recommended many to the <hi>unskilful,</hi> as very <hi>able men,</hi> well verſed in <hi>Political Affairs,</hi> and he could not be thought leſs than a <hi>States-man</hi> who would <hi>embelliſh</hi> his Diſcourſe with thoſe <hi>lofty Strains,</hi> wherein either ſome of the <hi>Poliſh Iskis, Eskis, Oskis</hi> or <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kis</hi> made up each Period. Such <hi>ſublime pedantry</hi> as this is often adopted by the <hi>amaz'd Vulgar</hi> for <hi>ſublime wiſdom;</hi> whereas in the truth it is but the <hi>gariſh display</hi> of a <hi>volatile Fancy:</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that <hi>effeminate faculty</hi> is for the moſt part <hi>predominant</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>lower orders of Mankind,</hi> they are ſnatched into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and ſympathetical adherence to any thing that is tinctured with it.</p>
            <p>Thus the ſlight and unſolid <hi>Rhetorications</hi> of an ordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident <hi>Critick,</hi> dragg the <hi>ſupine Vulgar</hi> into the <hi>filth</hi> of <hi>Cenſoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>civil blasphemy</hi> of things they know not, making them to <hi>ſet their Mouths againſt the Heavens,</hi> and with a <hi>Train of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Lyes,</hi> like <hi>Lucifer</hi> the Father of <hi>Lyes,</hi> to dethrone the <hi>Stars</hi> if it were poſſible. And theſe are ſomewhat a kin to thoſe whom in the Fifth Page of this <hi>Treatiſe</hi> I call by the Name of <hi>State-Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> a whimſical race of people that the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> ſeduce, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing into them an <hi>inchanting Ferment,</hi> a <hi>Hotch-potch</hi> of <hi>State-Hereſies</hi> drawn from <hi>Caſuiſts, Civilians,</hi> and <hi>corrupted Divines:</hi> Not that I think every one that talks about theſe things to be vers'd in the whole <hi>Syſtem</hi> of ſuch <hi>Jeſuitical Doctrines,</hi> for as I have above ſaid, many illiterate perſons may gain the Credit of being <hi>States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> among the <hi>Vulgar</hi> by ſome <hi>Pedantick Tricks,</hi> as <hi>voluble diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,</hi>

               <hi>confident deportment,</hi> and the like, who yet may be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether devoid of any ſmattering in that other Learning; but yet there are too too many whoſe Fancies being parturient, verifie that in the Civil Law which my Lord <hi>Verulam</hi> obſerved of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, <hi>a little of which will make a man an Atheiſt:</hi> for theſe <hi>Semi-Civilians,</hi> like thoſe <hi>Philoſophaſters,</hi> ſit down contented with that ſmall diſcovery the firſt Stage gives them in the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Nations, and ſo make falſe concluſions, couching the moſt copious <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> and <hi>Queſtions</hi> within the narrow limits of their Inchoate knowledge, eſpecially being blinded by their <hi>ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Guides,</hi> the <hi>Jeſuites,</hi> and falſly perſwaded that all <hi>Secular Science</hi> was contained in that <hi>Fragment</hi> they were acquainted with, (like the <hi>Ruſticks</hi> who think the utmoſt limits of the World ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend no farther then the <hi>Margin</hi> of the viſible <hi>Horizon)</hi> whereas if they had the patience to go on, and their Underſtandings were not darkned, they would find that each ſtep enlarged their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, till they had gone over the whole Sphere of <hi>Political Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> returning to the Point whence they ſet forth, where they might recollect with themſelves, that as in all Orbs, ſo in this Circle of Humane Learning, there was a viciſſitude of Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; that is, they who have compleated their Knowledge and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed their Diſquiſitions in the truth, may yet remember how variouſly they have altered their opinions of things, according to the ſtrength or weakneſs of Arguments occurring in their way, and therefore ought not to be dazled into a haſty implicite Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to any thing by its vigour and flaſhy light, without examining or making a Scrutiny, whence the Ray proceeded, whether from Heaven or Hell, (for that has its counterfeit Beams alſo.)</p>
            <p>To make my meaning more plain, It is well known that many Mechanick perſons of otherwiſe jejune Intellects, will yet pretend to a ſmack in that ſpurious mixture of <hi>Democratical Policy</hi> that is pickt out of ſome Heathen Writers, ſome Papiſts, and not a few <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and all Incorporated into one Maſs, and Informed by that <hi>Soul of Atheiſm and Hereſie,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobbs:</hi> Theſe <hi>Mechanicks</hi> I ſay, will inſiſt on the Notions of Natural Liberty and Supremacy in the people, and ſuch like ſtuff, having Imbib'd theſe Principles either immediately from Books, or from their Converſe with men who have read thoſe Books, which though they have gone

            <p>But I forget that it is an <hi>Eſſay</hi> I am writing, and yet I have no reaſon to do ſo, the very Immethodical Style might put me in mind of that: And indeed were I not conſcious of its being Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſurate to an <hi>Eſſay,</hi> I would beg the Readers excuſe for Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing ſo confuſed a <hi>Collection of Thoughts.</hi> However this I may ſay, That though it be void of <hi>Symmetry,</hi> yet that <hi>deficiency</hi> is made up in the <hi>multitude</hi> and <hi>validity</hi> of its <hi>Arguments,</hi> which though <hi>ſcattered</hi> without <hi>Order</hi> in the <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> may yet be redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to it by the <hi>active</hi> and <hi>ſagacious mind,</hi> the disjoynted parcels being by that <hi>penetrating vertue</hi> ſetled, and by <hi>Intellectual Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> united in their proper reſpects and uſes to the deſign of the whole <hi>SCHEME.</hi>

            <p>THat the ſeeming Extravagancies in the Style of this <hi>Eſſay,</hi> may be the more readily excuſed by the Intelligent: The <hi>Author</hi> thought himſelf concerned to add a word or two to what he had ſaid in the <hi>Preface to the Reader,</hi> for he is bold to profeſs his Hopes, that this <hi>Short Diſcourſe</hi> though in never ſo odd and exotick a Dreſs, may find Acceptance with ſome, as others concerning the ſame <hi>Subject,</hi> only digested into a different form, are entertained by their proper <hi>Genius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
