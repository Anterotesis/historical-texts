            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Mr. SPEAKERS SPEECH In the LORDS House of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, <hi>Iune</hi> 22. 1641.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hat policy, most gratious and dread Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne, which weighs the Prerogative of the King and property of the Subject in the same Scales, and increases the plenty of the Crowne, and contentment of the people; the even poising of this Beame enables both, the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ordained for the preservation of the other.</p>
            <p>This principle is so riveted into the hearts of your Subjects by the Acts of their Ancestours, &amp; traditions of their fore-fathers, that it hath created a beliefe in them, that their wills are bound to a due allegiance, and their fortunes and estates, as well as their duty and subjection, must bend to the Commands of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne power with which God hath invested your sacred Majestie.</p>
            <p>Compulsary obedience, advanced by the transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent power of Prerogative, is too weake to support the right of government: It is the affections &amp; estates of your people, tyed with the threads of obedience, by the rules of Law, that fastens safety and prosperity to the Crowne.</p>
            <p>The experiment of elder times, in the raignes of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:96649:3"/>
the most valiant puissant Princes, hath concluded this the Soveraigne preservative against the diseases of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction and confusion, and makes it manifest to the world, that the honour and glory of this Throne is to command the hearts of free-men.</p>
            <p>This admitted, the permission of the least diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or any eclipsed interposition betweene the honour and plenty of the Crowne, contracts a Scorne upon the Nation.</p>
            <p>Severall Parliaments in former times have stampt the Character of a free gift upon the fore-front of this aid, still offered by the people, as a sacrifice of thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to the Crowne, for the safe conduct of your Merchants, and provision of the Navie, to strengthen your undoubted dominion over the seas, which hath protected your Allyes, and is a terrour to your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>Our hopes were long since to have settled this for the measure and the time, and with this to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to your sacred Majestie the triumphant palme of Tranquillity in all your Kingdomes: But, as a ship floating upon a rough Sea, we have been cast upon the Rock of feare and dangers, and tossed on the Billows of distraction and distrust of Church and Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, where we yet remaine hopelesse ever to passe through that narrow channell which leads to the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of Peace, unlesse we be speedily steered on by the hand of your sacred wisdome, care and providence.</p>
            <p>In the midst of all these troubles, and the severall opinions which have beene amongst us, no division had power to distract any one of us from the care and duty we owe to your sacred Person.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96649:3"/>
And, to that end am I now sent by the Commons of England, to present this as a Marke onely, whereby your sacred Majestie may view the inward duties of our hearts, untill time and opportunity will give leave for a further expression of our duties and affections. The acceptation of this Gift will glad the hearts of your people, and the approbation by the royall assent of this Bill (being the largest for the measure which was ever given) will joyne wings to our desires and hopes, which shall never returne without that Olive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leafe, which may declare that the waters are abated, and your sacred Majestie may have full assurance of the faith and loyaltie of your Subjects.</p>
