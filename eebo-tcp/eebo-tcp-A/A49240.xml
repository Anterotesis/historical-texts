            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

aſſault us, that we may hereby come to a ſight of our own weakneſs and infirmities, when we have received many foils, and learn to relie upon his help and aſſiſtance in all our dangers: for ſo proud we are by nature, that before we come to fight, we think we can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel the ſtrongeſt aſſaults, &amp; overcome all ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies which oppoſe themſelves againſt us by their own power, but when we ſée our ſelves vanquiſhed by every ſmall temptation, we learn to have a more humble conceit of our own ability and depend wholly upon the Lord, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

True it is that Saints do receive wounds and foils<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when as Satan hath drawn them to commit ſin, but they are not wounded at the heart, becauſe they do not ſin with full conſent of the will, for they allow not that which they do, neither do that which they would, but what they hate: and they delight in the law of God, in the inner man, when the fleſh leadeth them cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the law of ſin, <hi>Rom. 7.15.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:32768:14"/>We come now to the fourth piece of Chriſtian armour, which the Apoſtle exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth us to put on, which is <hi>the ſhield of faith</hi>: which part above all other parts is moſt neceſſary: becauſe how weak ſoever we be in our ſelf, it doth defend and protect us againſt all temptations of Satan. For he that putteth on faith, putteth on Ieſus Chriſt alſo, it being a property inſeparable of faith, to apply unto us Chriſt Ieſus, and all his benefits; that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his merits, and righteouſneſſe, and everlaſting life it ſelf.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore <hi>take unto us the ſhield of faith,</hi> that we may alſo put on the Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, as the Apoſtle exhorteth us, <hi>Rom. 13.14.</hi> For having him, we ſhall want nothing which may either defend our ſelves, or offend our enemies: the Lord himſelf will be our ſhield and buckler, and therefore it will be impoſſible for our foes to prevail againſt us.</p>
            <p>Again, let us further conſider the vertue and neceſſity of this ſhield of faith, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue whereof appeareth by its repelling the fiery darts of Satan: the Apoſtle ſaith, that thereby we may quench his fiery darts, allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the cuſtome of Souldiers in anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time, who maliciouſly poyſoned their
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:32768:15"/>
darts, whereby the bodies of thoſe that they wounded, were ſo inflamed that they could hardly be cured or eaſed of their ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and burning pain; and ſuch darts are all Satans temptations, whereby we are wounded with ſin; for if they be not repel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and quenched with the ſhield of faith, they will in flame our luſts to ſin, and one ſin will inflame our hearts to anoth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r, till there be kindled in us a world of wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>This we may ſée in the example of <hi>David,</hi> who after that he gave himſelf to idleneſs and ſloth, and ſo was pierced with one of Satans fiery darts, it preſently inflamed his heart to commit adultery, and having given place to that, he was provoked to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            <p>Therefore it behoveth us to take unto us the ſhield of faith, whereby we may quench theſe fiery darts, but why doth the Apoſtle uſe this unproper ſpéech, ſéeing the ſhield of faith doth not quench, but repel the darts that beat upon it?</p>
            <p>I anſwer: partly to ſhew the nature of our enemies temptations; namely, that they be f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ery, mortal, raging, and pernicious, and partly to ſet forth a double vertue of faith.</p>
            <p>For firſt thereby we repel and beat back

his temptations, and ſo <hi>reſiſt him ſtedfaſt in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, if Satans darts have pierced and wounded us, faith alſo doth cool the ſcalding heat of ſin, by applying unto us the precious balm of Chriſts blood; ſo that our wounds are not mortal unto us.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe vertues is ſignified here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, in that he calleth faith a ſhield which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelleth Satans temptations, as the ſhield doth the darts that are caſt againſt it.</p>
            <p>The ſecond by the word (quenching) name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as water quencheth the fire, ſo faith quench<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I procéed now to the fifth part of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian armour, which is the helmet of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which is ſo called, becauſe it bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Salvation to them that wear it, for we are ſaved by hope, as it is in <hi>Rom. 8.24.</hi> which we are to underſtand by the helmet of Salvation, as it appeareth in <hi>1 Theſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5.8.</hi> where he exhorteth us to put on the hope of Salvation for an helmet.</p>
            <p>As no man in his right wits, would ſell his certain intereſt unto a goodly inheritance, for a bright ſhining counter: ſo much leſs will any man who is not ſtark-mad, ſell his aſſured hope of the eternal kingdome of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,

by yielding himſelf the ſlave of ſin and Satan, to purchaſe for the preſent, the worlds counterfeit ſhining excellencies, which are in truth, but mutable, or at leaſt momentary vanities.</p>
            <p>And though he aſſault us on the one ſide, as he did <hi>St. Paul,</hi> with afflictions and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions; yet we will with him for the hope of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> be content to be bound in the chains of miſery and affliction, for the heavieſt croſs will ſéem tolerable, yea an eaſie yoke, and a light burthen to thoſe who do expect and hope for a far more excellent and eternal weight of glory.</p>
            <p>Now therefore if we do not put on this helmet we ſhall not dare to lift up our heads in the day of battel; for as thoſe who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged with hope of victory, and the ſpoil enſuing, do fight valiantly, ſo thoſe who are quite forſaken of hope, do forſake alſo the field, and caſt down their armour and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, and do either run away, or cowardly yield unto the enemy.</p>
            <p>And ſo much for the defenſive armour which we muſt put on, that which follows is both defenſive, and offenſive, fit to defend our ſelves and repel and foil the enemy: the firſt is the ſword of the Spirit, the word of God, this the Apoſtle cals the ſword of the Spirit;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:32768:17"/>
becauſe it is a ſpiritual and not a carnal weapon, which the ſpirit of God hath as it were tempered, made, ſharpened, and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our hands, to repel all our ſpiritual ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies whenſoever they aſſault us.</p>
            <p>Now we are taught to imitate our grand Captain the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, who though he were able to have confuted Satan by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arguments, or to have confounded him by his power: yet as he ſuffered himſelf to be tempted in all things like unto us, ſo he uſed the ſame weapons which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed us to uſe in this ſpiritual Combat of temptation, to the end that we might be taught how to handle them, having his example for imitation, and alſo may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive aſſured hope of victory, conſidering that our Captain ſubdued Satan with the ſelf ſame weapons.</p>
            <p>Whenſoever therefore we are aſſaulted by Satan, let us draw out the ſword of the ſpirit, that we may defend our ſelves, and give him the foil, as being the moſt fit wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon for the purpoſe: and ſéeing this ſword is ſo excellent, let us highly eſtéem of it, and manfully uſe it whenſoever Satan doth aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault us, and tempt us to commit ſin.</p>
            <p>As for example, when he enticeth us t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> commit ſin, and extenuates it, as though
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:32768:18"/>
it were but a may game and a trick of youth, which God regardeth not: let us draw out the ſword of the ſpirit, ſaying that all they are accurſed who continue not in all that is written in that book of the Law to do it, <hi>Gal. 3.10.</hi> They who live according to the fleſh cannot pleaſe God. <hi>Rom. 8.8.</hi> That the burthen of ſin cannot be light, ſéeing it preſſed out of Chriſt himſelf, a bloody ſweat.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, if he aggravate the hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs of our ſins, to the end he may draw us unto deſpair of Gods mercies, let us ſay it is written, <hi>I will not the death of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>but that herepent and live, Ezek. 18.23. And that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, 1 Tim. 1.15.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that he <hi>came not to call the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, but ſinners to repentance, Matth. 9.13. Joh. 3.16.</hi> If he tempt us to the love of the world, and to the ſervice of this unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mammon, let us anſwer him that it is impoſſible to ſerve two maſters of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary diſpoſitions, as it is written, <hi>Matth. 6.24.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If we love the world, the love of the father abideth not in us, 1 John 2.15. That the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the world, is enmity againſt God, James 4.4.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:32768:18"/>Again, if by renouncing the world, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring to ſerve the Lord in uprightneſs and in truth, he ſéeks to draw us from our integrity, by threatning afflictions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, we are to ſtrengthen our ſelves, and reſiſt him with the ſword of the Spirit, remembring that they are <hi>bleſſed which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer perſecution for righteouſneſs ſake; for theirs is the Kingdom of heaven, Matth. 5.10.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All that will live Godly in Chriſt Ieſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecution, <hi>1 Tim. 3.12.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That whoſoever loſeth any thing for Chriſts ſake ſhall receive in recompence an hundred fold more, and have everlaſting life to boot, <hi>Matth. 19.29.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If he tempt us to the neglect of Gods word, we are to tell him that all Chriſts ſhéep hear his voice, and follow him, <hi>John 10.27. That whoſoever is of God, heareth Gods words, John 8.47.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They who know God, hear his miniſters, whereas he that is not of God, heareth them not, <hi>1 John 4.6.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, if he tempt us to content our ſelves with the bare hearing thereof, neglecting obedience thereunto, we are to tell him, that not the hearers of the word, but the doers thereof ſhall be juſtified, <hi>Rom. 2.13.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:32768:19"/>And they that are hearers of the Word, and not doers alſo, deceive themſelves, <hi>Jam. 1.22.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not every one that ſaith Lord, Lord (that is, maketh a goodly profeſſion of religion) ſhall enter into the Kingdom of heaven, but he that doth the will of the Father who is in heaven, <hi>Matth. 7.21.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So when he tempteth us unto pride, we are to ſay unto him, Satan, I may not enter into thy temptation; for it is written, <hi>God reſiſteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble, 1 Pet. 5.5.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus may we repel the violence of all Satans temptations, and give him the foil, if we will take unto us the ſword of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and skilfully uſe the ſame in the fight; for it is not ſufficient that we have the ſword lying by us, if we do not draw it out in the diſpute to fight the ſpiritual Combat, but let it reſt in the Scabbard. It behoveth every poor Chriſtian to come into Gods School continually, that there we may learn how to handle the ſword of the Spirit, that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt Satan in all his aſſaults, and give him no advantage in the fight.</p>
            <p>Otherwiſe he will uſe it to our own over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, for if he durſt fight with our Savior Chriſt with his own weapon, the word of
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:32768:19"/>
God, whoſe knowledge was e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>quiſite, and without meaſure; how much more will he be buſied in uſing it againſt us, who have not attained unto the leaſt part of his skill?</p>
            <p>Firſt, then hereby appeareth the carnal wretchedneſs of many poor ſouls, who as if they had no enemy to oppoſe them, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault them, have not this weapon in their houſes at all, and if they have, yet they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow more time in profane exerciſes, then in ſtudy how to uſe this ſword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, for their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and too many truſting to their own skill as ſufficient in it ſelf, they ſeldome come to the Lords School, where they may learn to uſe the weapon of Gods word for their beſt advantage.</p>
            <p>Secondly, hereby appeareth the wicked practices of the enemies of Gods truth, who take from Gods people, the ſword of the Spirit, which the Lord hath given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all for their defence.</p>
            <p>Neither doth the Apoſtle exhort onely Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to take this weapon, but all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans whatſoever, who are aſſaulted with their ſpiritual enemies.</p>
            <p>The laſt, and chief means whereby we may both defend our ſelves, and offend our enemies; is fervent and effectual prayer,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:32768:20"/>
which the Apoſtle exhorteth us to, <hi>Epheſ. 6.18.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And pray alwaies: the neceſſity and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of which exerciſe, is very great in this ſpiritual Combat; becauſe thereby we do obtain all our ſtrength to fight, and victory alſo over our enemies.</p>
            <p>For firſt, we cannot indure the leaſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault of Satan by our ſtrength, unleſs we be armed with the power of Gods might, and the Lords aſſiſtance, whereby onely we can overcome, is obtained by earneſt and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual prayer, <hi>Pſal. 50.15.</hi> Call upon me in the day of trouble; ſo will I deliver thée, and thou ſhalt glorifie me. And our Saviour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribeth us the means to frée our ſelves from temptation, or at leaſt, from being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by it, that we crave the Lords aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ſaying, Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil, <hi>Matth. 6.13.</hi> ſo he exhorteth his Diſciples unto prayer, leſt they ſhould enter into temptation, <hi>Luke 22.40.46.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, we cannot obtain the ſpiritual armour (before deſcribed) by any means of our own, and therefore are to be begged at his hands, by earneſt and effectual prayer, we having his gracious promiſe, that if we ask, we ſhall receive, <hi>Matth. 7.7.</hi> And our
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:32768:20"/>
Savior hath aſſured us, that whatſoever we ask the Father in his name, he will give it us, <hi>John 16.23.</hi> And to this his promiſe he addeth his commandment in the verſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, Ask and ye ſhall receive, <hi>verſ. 24.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that our prayers may be effectual, there are divers conditions and properties required in them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That we pray continually, which our Saviour Chriſt injoyneth, <hi>Luke 18.1.</hi> Not that we muſt neglect all other duties, and do nothing but pray, for there is a time to hear the word, to do the works of mercy, and of our callings: but his meaning is, that we be alwaies ready to pray upon all good oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns, eſpecially in the time of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond thing required, is, that we pray with all manner of prayer and ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, when we want any thing that is good, or would be delivered from any thing that is evil, we muſt have recourſe to God by prayer, that we may obtain the one, and avoid the other; but more eſpecially when we féel the want or weakneſs of our ſpiritual armour, we are then to beg the graces of Gods ſpirit, we are to beg them at Gods hand, that ſo we may be able to withſtand the encounter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:32768:21"/>The third thing required, is that we may in, or by the Spirit.</p>
            <p>The words may be taken both waies.</p>
            <p>Firſt, therefore we muſt pray in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which is required that we pray with underſtanding.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We muſt pray with attentive minds, joyning our hearts with our lips.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We muſt pray with a pure conſcience, and faith unfained, lifting up pure hands to God without wrath or doubting, <hi>1 Tim. 2.8.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus have I deſcribed the Chriſtian ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, which every man is to put on before he enter into the Combat, with our ſpiritual enemies, if we reſiſt Satan he will flie from us, <hi>Jam. 4.7.</hi> but if we give ground and betake our ſelves to flight, he will pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue us ſwiftly, and deadly wound us, for we have no armour on the back, to defend us from the violence of his blows, neither will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord protect ſuch faint-hearted co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards as run away from his ſtandard, not daring to truſt and relye upon his mighty power, and never failing aſſiſtance, which he hath promiſed to all that fight his Battel. Seeing therefore there is no ſafety in flight, but aſſured victory to them that faint not, but endure the brunt of the battel, let us
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:32768:21"/>
manfully ſtand upon our guard, neither fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nor yielding to our ſpiritual enemies; for where can we be more ſafe, then under the Lords Standard? where can we be more honourably imployed, then in fighting his Battel? how can our ſtate be more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous then when we flye and Satan purſueth us? how can it be more deſperate then when we yield our ſelves captive to Satan, to be bound in the fetters of ſin, until the ſentence of condemnation be pronounced on us, in the general Seſſions at the day of Chriſts appearing? From the which ſad ſentence the Lord of his tender mercies, grant that every poor ſoul of us may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered.</p>
            <p>Thus having given you an account of our ſpiritual armour, and laid down the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to incourage you to fight this ſpiritual warfare: I now come to give you ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to ſtir you up to this work, that we ſhould not ſet our hearts on this world and worldly things, becauſe we are but Pilgrims and ſtrangers here on earth; as appeareth by the acknowledgement of the Saints and Servants of God, in times of old, of whom it is ſaid, that they confeſt they were <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims and Strangers on the earth, Heb. 11.13.</hi> the which as it is manifeſt by the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:32768:22"/>
ſo it is demonſtrated by evident rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: for that is to be eſtéemed a mans coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where his chief friends and kindred re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, where his living, and ſubſtance doth lie, where he is to ſpend the moſt part of his life; where he hath moſt contentment, and beſt entertainment: but the faithful have all their kindred in heaven, ſaving ſome few who are pilgrims with them on the earth, there is their heavenly Father, and Chriſt Ieſus their elder brother, there are their chief treaſures, even an inheritance undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that fadeth not away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> finally there they have beſt entertainment, and moſt content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: becauſe there all tears ſhall be wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from their eyes, and there they ſhall have manſion-houſes, inheritances, crowns of glory, and fulneſſe of joy for evermore.</p>
            <p>Now from this conſideration, that we are not in our own country, but remain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth as pilgrims and ſtrangers, ſhould ſerve as an effectual reaſon to wean our hearts from the love of the world and worldly vanities, and to place them in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and onely in heavenly joys, which is our country, and place of reſidence: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we be pilgrims on earth, we muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low their practice, and not ſet our hearts on worldly things; becauſe the time we have to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:32768:22"/>
enjoy them is very ſhort, let him that hath enjoyed worldly proſperity the longeſt time, look back, and he ſhall ſée that all that is paſt is but as a dream, or ſhadow, and as the twinkling of an eye, in reſpect of eternity: but all our love and longing muſt be placed on our heavenly inheritance, where we are for ever to enjoy an eternal weight of glory and happineſs without end.</p>
            <p>Now if we would thus eſtéem of the world and worldly vanities, learn then of the (Apoſtle) to uſe them as though we uſed them not, not as places to reſt in, or things wherein we take our chief repoſe; but as a way to travel in, and as neceſſaries to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther us in our journey: who would ſeat his heart and affections on thoſe delights which he ſéeth as he paſſeth by? who in his right wits will ſo doat on theſe things in which he hath not any intereſt, as that he ſhould neglect far better and permanent delights in his own country?</p>
            <p>Let us then like travellers refreſh our ſelves with the things of this life; and ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain go forward on our journy, caſt away e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that preſſeth down, and the ſin that hangeth faſt on, and let us run with patience the race that is ſet before us: let us learn to imitate the Eagle, which ſeldome
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:32768:23"/>
lighteth on the earth, but when conſtrain'd with hunger, ſhe ſtoopeth to her prey, and when ſhe hath fed, mounteth again aloft a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the clouds: ſo let us not ſuffer our hearts and affections any longer to reſt upon the earth, then we are compel'd with our preſent neceſſities, but like the Eaglets of Ieſus Chriſt, let us reſort thither where the dead carcaſe is, and being fed herewith, let us amount high in divine contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, having our converſation in heaven, and let us like ſtrangers and pilgrims ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from carnal luſts, which fight againſt our ſouls.</p>
            <p>Again, the world is not ſimply a place of pilgrimage alone, but a place of warfare, wherein we are aſſaulted on all ſides, and by all poſſible means, hindred in our ſpiritual voyage, and therefore ſéeing our time is but ſhort, and ſo full of trouble, let us ſeat our affections, and our hearts on the main buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which tends to our ſpiritual warfare: as <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaith, the daies of his pilgrimage were not onely few but evil alſo, <hi>Gen. 47 9.</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> affirmeth, <hi>that man who is born of a woman is but of ſhort continuance, and full of trouble, Job 14.1.</hi> And therefore while we are here we had néed to be always in the compleat armour of a Chriſtian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:32768:23"/>
we fight not onely againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt Principalities, Powers, and worldly Governours, the Prince of the darkneſs of the world, which are in high places, let us then with the Apoſtle, <hi>ſo run that we may obtain, 1 Cor. 9. 24, 25.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us, being to wreſtle with ſuch mighty enemies, like him that proveth maſteries, abſtain from all things which might hinder us to obtain a crown is incorruptible, let us come into the field againſt our ſpiritual ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, not loaded and incumbred with the burden of worldly traſh, tyed faſt unto us the bounds of carnal love, which ſhall but betray us into the hands of thoſe foes which ſéek our overthrow, but let us run armed with Gods ſpiritual graces, and aſſiſted with the power of his might. whereby we ſhall be inabled to obtain the victory, that ſo we may ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, and have kept the faith, from henceforth is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs, which the Lord, the righteous judge ſhall give me at that day, 2 Tim. 4. 7, 8.</hi> Séeing this is promiſed, as he affirmeth, not to him alone, but to all them who obtain the victory in this ſpiritual war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, according to that gracious promiſe, in <hi>Revel. 3.27. to him that overcometh will

            <p>I come now to a ſecond motive, to ſtir us up to look after heavenly treaſure, and not immoderately to love the world, and worldly vanities, becauſe we are pilgrims here, and therefore muſt leave them in our paſſage, ſo we are Citizens of heaven, the new <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>: the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>we having through Chriſt an entrance unto the father by one ſpirit, are now no more ſtrangers and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, but Citizens with the Saints, and of the houſhold of God</hi>: and ſpeaking of <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of the faithful, he ſaith, <hi>That he abode in the land of promiſe, as in a ſtrange country, and as one that dwelt in tents, becauſe he looked for a City not made with hands, having a foundation whoſe builder and maker is God</hi>; neither was this peculiar to him alone, but general to all his Children, who followed him in the saith: of whom it is ſaid, <hi>that they have here no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing City, but ſeek one to come, Heb. 11. 6, 9, 10.</hi> And the reaſon is apparent, for we are Citizens, and ſubjects of that Kingdom, whereof our Lord Ieſus Chriſt is King, but he himſelf hath plainly told us, that his kingdom is not of this world, but that he
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:32768:24"/>
reigneth and ruleth in that kingdom of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glory: and therefore whoſoever are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects unto him, they cannot be frée denizons of the world, but Citizens of heaven.</p>
            <p>It is no marvel that heretofore we living in ignorance, did not eſtéem of thoſe divine excellencies, but preferred before them theſe worldly vanities: becauſe they are ſubject to our ſelves, for there is no deſire of that which is not known, and that bright ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine day is all alike to him, who is ſtark-blind unto the darkeſt night. But now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the grace of God which bringeth ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation unto all men, hath appeared, and taught us that we ſhould deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and that we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world, looking for the bleſſed hope and appearing of the glory of the mighty God, and of our Saviour Ieſus Chriſt, <hi>Titus 2. 11, 12, 13.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It were more then madneſs, if we ſhould ſuffer our ſelves ſtill to be tranſported with worldly concupiſcence, and prefer the preſent ſatiſfying of our carnal deſires before the eternal fruition of our heavenly joys: we ſhould not be alwayes children wanting wit and experience in heavenly affairs, it is time now to put away childiſh things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:32768:25"/>Whilſt we remain'd in the ſtate of ſlaves, and were the devoted vaſſals of ſin and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, our baſe deſires did well agree with our baſe condition, whilſt we were Citizens of the world, and children of the earth, it might ſute with our calling to deſire earthly como<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, and eſtéem the riches, pleaſures, and preferments of the place whereof we were inhabitants at high rates, but now that God hath dignified us with moſt royal priviledges, and made us Citizens of heaven; and of the ſlaves of Satan, hath made us his own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by adoption and grace, yea heirs appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of his glorious kingdom: O let us, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring this high calling, for ſhame for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake our baſe deſires, not ſuffering our hearts to lie grobeling on the earth, wallowing in carnal pleaſures, and worldly delights, but raiſing them up to the height of our hopes, let us aim at no leſs then crowns and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and thoſe not momentary, and of this world, ſéeing they are vain and of little worth, but thoſe which are moſt glorious and eternal in the world to come.</p>
            <p>Having ſhewed you the priviledges of the Citizens of heaven, I ſhall now give you a hint of thoſe ineffable and inconceivable joys of heaven: the Apoſtle <hi>St. Paul</hi> ſéems to intimate that he was taken up into paradice,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:32768:25"/>
               <hi>2 Cor. 12.41.</hi> That we may have ſome glimps of the glory, we are to know that the joys of heaven, is nothing elſe but that chief happineſs and ſupreme felicity, which the holy Saints having ſerved God in this life, ſhall eternally injoy with God himſelf, and his ſon Chriſt, in the life to come: the joys of heaven are called a torrent of pleaſures, a timely fountain, a majeſtical temple; it is called a Crown, a Crown of righteouſneſs, and leſt it ſhould be like the worldly crowns that fade away and ſubject to change, it is a crown incorruptible, which cannot be taken from us, a crown of life that cannot be loſt by death: yea it is called glory it ſelf. Thus the raviſhing joys of heaven are plainly noted by thoſe titles and ſimilitudes, which are in the word of God aſcribed to it; and it is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther denoted by way of a manſion, a dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling houſe we are to remain in, and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, but an inheritance that is immortal, and undefiled, that paſſeth not away, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible crown, which cannot periſh: a fountain of life, which is never dry, an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal life which hath no end.</p>
            <p>A Kingdom which cannot be ſhaken by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny violence, and eternal glory that hath no limits nor end. And thus we ſée in part the excellency of thoſe heavenly joys: There are two parts of thoſe joys.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:32768:26"/>1. The abſence of all evil.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The preſence of all good: we ſhal have a freedome from all evils that may trouble us, and have the fruition of all thoſe things that can delight and comfort us.</p>
            <p>Here we are content to injoy the victory over all fleſh and blood: this is the bleſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; this is the eternal manſion of glory, for which ſo many of the Saints and holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs of God have fought manfully under Chriſts Banner, and have béen found more then conquerors through Chriſt that loved them. Let us therefore ſo ſtrive and fight, that we may obtain a glorious conqueſt over the ſpiritual enemies of our Salvation, and ſo obtain the crown of Victory, which God hath promiſed us; even that glorious felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the eternal happineſs of his heavenly kingdom, the which if it be the bleſſed will of Ieſus Chriſt the righteous to grant us, who hath dearly bought it for us, to whom with the Father, and his holy Spirit be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to him; by all his Church, all honor, glory, praiſe, and thankſgiving, obedience, and dominion, henceforth and for evermore.</p>
            <closer>Amen.</closer>
