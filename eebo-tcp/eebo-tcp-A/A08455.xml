            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the right honourable and vertuous <hi>Queene ELYZABETH,</hi>
            </head>
            <p>All grace, peace and comfort from God the Father of mercy, through Iesus Christ our loving Lord and Saviour be multiplyed unto you, and so lead your Majesty by his H. Spirit through this world, as a wofull wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse, and bring your Highnes at the last into his Heavenly Canaan, which is the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly desire of your Majesties poore petitioner THOMAS ODELL Englishman.</p>
            <p>HAving hard and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the manifold tryals &amp; troubles, wherein the Lord hath exercise your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, I have ofttimes purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed some part of my poore labour, to prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t unto your Lord and King (now at rest) but I was oftentimes hindred in things concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning myself, and most of all through the grieveous afflictions that befell your

Majesty. Your Highnes with many other may thinke it strange, that one so bace should be so bold or presume to present any thing to your Highnes hands, wanting lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which thing I willingly confesse, for hee that giveth out his beste tallents, giveth to one five, to another two, and to another one, and yet may not that one be buried, but brought to the banke to the Lord, and owners prayse, and good of whomsoever it shall him please. I minding these things, and withall your Majesties lowly and lovely behaviour towards our country-men or women of meane estate, have bene emboldened now at the last to present unto your Highnes this small Treatise, shewing unto all, that the life of a true Christian, is no other then a Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage through this wildernesse unto our Heavenly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan. And these things have I written in sundry parts, first for such which through the great strife and contention in these dayes are forced to runne too and froe, seeking the truth. Secondly the Pilgrimage of Abraham &amp; Sarah, our faithfull parents, and other of bace estate: Also of Hester, with hir Unckle Mordicai. And lastly some part of the worke of our loving Lord and Saviour Christ Iesus in his Pilgrimage, to worke out our Redemption. These things have I brought forth according to the grace of God, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto me, and acknowledging that my sight but dark, &amp; my knowledge but in part, I doe humbly entreate your Majesty, and ech Godly Reader, through Christian love, to beare with my weaknes herein, and so commit the issue to the Almighty, who preserve your Majesties person from all your enimies, secret or open, strengthen you in all cumbats inward &amp; outward to the end; and then give your Highnes a Crowne of glory in Heaven for ever and ever, Amen. So let it be, ô Lord.</p>
