            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It is greatly to be desired, that this course might be constantly continued, both in the teacher and in the hearers, that the one may the better lead the way, and as the Psalmist speakes, <hi>guide them with his owne eye of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi>

                  <hi>A.</hi> VNderstand that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Lords Supper, is when bread and wine representing the body and blood of Christ, broken and shed for vs, being by the Minister taken and blessed, is broken and poured forth, and so deliuered to all the faithfull present: and of them recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, by eating the bread and drinking the wine, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Christs death, as also to communicate vnto vs the very body and blood of Christ spiritually by faith: and so to confirme our faith
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:28202:109"/>
in Christ and loue one to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</p>
               <p>For this Sacrament is the signe of our new life, as Baptisme is of our new birth. And therefore as we haue neede of often nourishment, so wee ought to receiue often, and that with due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>Why is this Sacrament called the Lords Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> This Sacrament is called the Lords Supper for these reasons:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Lords Supper why so called.</hi>
                  </note> First a Supper, partly in regard of the time when it was instituted and celebrated: which was in the eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, before the day wherein Christ was crucified: partly in respect of the thing it selfe, because it is a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Feast or Banquet, appointed of God, not for the body, but for the soule. And it is called <hi>The Lords Supper,</hi> both in regard of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:28202:110"/>
who is the Lord Iesus him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe: as also in respect of the end, which was in remembrance of him.</p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What is the outward signe in the Lords Supper?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward signe is Bread and Wine.</hi>
                  </note>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The outward signe in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, doth consist of two elements, that is, Bread and Wine; for so our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour did institute, not one onely, but both: to shew, that in him wee haue perfect nourishment vnto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life: and the better to expresse the giuing vp of his Body, and the shedding of his Bloud for vs, which either the Bread alone, or the Wine alone, could not present vnto vs in so liuely manner. Againe, it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to the type, <hi>Gen. 14.18.</hi> that as <hi>Melchisedech,</hi> so Christ should nourish and refresh his Church with Bread and Wine.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The thing signified is the Body and Bloud of Christ Crucified.</hi>
                  </note>Q. <hi>What is the thing sigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Bread and Wine?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The thing signified is the Body and Bloud of Christ broken and shed for vs: this we may see by
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:28202:110"/>
the first institution, <hi>Luk. 22.19.20. This is my Body, which is giuen for you. This cup is the New Testament in my bloud, which is shed for you;</hi> againe, <hi>1 Cor. 11.24.
