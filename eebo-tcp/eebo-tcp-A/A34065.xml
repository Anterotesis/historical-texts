            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the Title and Preface.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. AFter my Second Part of the <hi>Hiſtory of Liturgies</hi> had been Public near Six Months, comes out <hi>An Examination of Dr. C's Scholaſtical Hiſtory of Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, by</hi> S. B. Which Title was deſigned, to make the Book look like and paſs for an Anſwer to both Parts, which conſiſt of 600 Pages; whereas the <hi>Examination</hi> reaches no further than to 76 Pages of the Firſt Part, and in that compaſs, 23 whole Pages, and a great part of 10 more, paſs Unexamined; ſo that there is an odd Synechdoche in this General Title. I will not enquire whether Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> be ſo Eminent, that all Men know him by that Cypher, or ſo obſcure, that he may be concealed under thoſe two Letters: Only I wiſh, when he deſign'd to garniſh his Title-page with <hi>Cauſabon</hi>'s Senſe of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, he had not fixed upon his account of the remote and general meaning of that word, and purpoſely omitted the only ſenſe of that word which is proper to our Queſtion, which he might have found in the ſame Page of <hi>Cauſabon, That</hi> Liturgy <hi>ſignifies a deſcription of the Order for celebrating Divine Offices, as in the Liturgies of</hi> Peter <hi>and</hi> James. <hi>Exercit.</hi> pag. 384.</p>
               <p>§. 2. If the Preface were writ by Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> it was politicly done to give us his own Character under another Name; if it were writ by the Publiſher, 'tis ſtrange that his Friend, who tells us, <hi>His Sayings, his Judgment, his Wiſhes, yea, his very Thoughts;</hi> ſhould ſo haſtily put out this inconſiderable part of the Controverſie without the Authors knowledge. But his Zeal
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93476:3"/>
to ſerve a Party in a Critical Juncture, and the rare Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter he gives of Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> will expiate for that ſeeming Rudeneſs. He tells us, Mr. <hi>S. B. is a Conformiſt;</hi> and it is well the Preface ſaith ſo, otherwiſe nothing in the Book diſcovers it; probably he is one of thoſe Mr. <hi>Clarkſon</hi> calls, <hi>Prudential Conformiſts; who comply to avoid the Laſh of the Law, but care no more for the Liturgy, than the Philoſophers of old did for the Vulgars Notions about the Gods.</hi> Diſc. of Lit. pag. 19. But the Preface ſaith, <hi>He Conforms upon Principles he thinks he can justifie.</hi> It ſeems he can Diſpute probably of all ſides, for he juſtifies <hi>Nonconformity</hi> in this Tract. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>He uſes the Liturgy as fully as the Law requires in his public Adminiſtrations;</hi> I wonder how he can juſtifie that, ſince his Book declares, he thinks he can pray better by his own Expreſſions, and there is a Curſe upon the Deceiver, <hi>who hath in his Flock a Male, yet offereth to the Lord a corrupt thing,</hi> Malach. I. 14. He hath tied himſelf up to an invariable uſe of the Common-Prayer, yet counts them, not only Pious, but Judicious, who will not be ſo tied up; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he muſt now doubt the piety and the prudence of his Subſcription. I perceive he <hi>joyns with Diſſenters in their public Worſhip:</hi> And I would gladly know, how many of them this open allowance of their way, hath brought over to joyn with him in the Liturgy. He accounts the Eſtabliſhed Church, <hi>a Party, and is not wedded to it neither:</hi> Probably he gave Her his Hand againſt his Will, and thinks the Contract null <hi>ab initio.</hi> He thinks there <hi>is ſomthing to be rectified in every Party;</hi> but in this Book he finds no faults with one Party, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of none but the Churches Friends. It is not he alone, but all Men <hi>think, that which is good in every Party, ſhould be approved; and what is not ſo, laid aſide, or amended.</hi> But who muſt be the indifferent Judge over all Parties? Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> (whatever his Friend thinks) will never be choſen to this Office: The real Conformiſts will not like a man who writes againſt Liturgies; and the Diſſenters will never truſt one that reads Common-Prayer. 'Tis pretended, <hi>He is ſorry to ſee ſuch an averſion to the general Union of Proteſtants, and that old Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities are awakned:</hi> Yet he widens the Breach, by increaſing the Diſſenters ill Opinion of all preſcribed Forms, which no well ordered Church can want; and he defends Mr. <hi>Clarkſon</hi>'s
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93476:3"/>
Book, which firſt awakned this Controverſie after it had ſlept for many years. Perhaps, <hi>in his Opinion, none prejudice the Church of</hi> England <hi>ſo much, as thoſe who ſeem moſt zealous for Her:</hi> But others ſee, ſhe is far more prejudiced by ſuch as are ſo indifferent what become of Her, that they expoſe her Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions; and while they enjoy her Revenues, combine with thoſe that are for removing her very Foundations. He that ſtates Matters ſo falſly, is no fit Judge how others ſtate their Queſtions; and I ſhall neither value the Cenſures or Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of one ſo manifeſtly partial, that he never ſpeaks ill of the Diſſenters, nor well of the Church. He told the Prefacer (it ſeems) his Thoughts, <hi>That in a Hiſtory of Liturgies, notice ſhould have been taken of the various uſe of the Word, and the time it came first to be uſed in the ſtrict Modern ſenſe, as Mr.</hi> Cl. <hi>hath rightly done.</hi> This aims at me, whom he ſuppoſes to have omitted this; but I ſpent Five Pages together, from <hi>pag.</hi> 121—to <hi>pag.</hi> 125. <hi>(Part I.)</hi> in conſidering the uſe of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and ſhewing, Mr. <hi>Carkſon</hi> had ſtated the time of its being taken in the Modern ſenſe, very falſly. Now, if he read my Firſt Book over, why doth he not confute this? If he never read ſo far, <hi>Solomon</hi> will tell him, <hi>He that anſwereth a Matter before he heareth it, it is folly and ſhame to him,</hi> Prov. XVIII. 13. However, Mr. <hi>S. B. conceives, this is not the ſignification of a</hi> Liturgy, <hi>as uſed and enjoyned by the Church of</hi> England. Right! for no Man ever ſaid, that <hi>[Liturgy,]</hi> without ſome Epithet, ſignified, <hi>a Liturgy enjoyned by this or that Church:</hi> But it hath from ſome of the earlieſt Ages, ſignified <hi>a Public Form of Prayer,</hi> and we have now ſuch an one enjoyned. But <hi>he thinks</hi> (that's proof enough) <hi>inſtead of proving the Antiquity of Liturgies in that Senſe, we ſhould rectifie the Miſtakes that have ariſen concerning a Liturgy, as uſed and enjoyned in our Church.</hi> He forgets, that Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> was the firſt who gave occaſion to prove their Antiquity, and the firſt who queſtioned it; <hi>Smectymnuus,</hi> and all that Party formerly, owned them to be 1300 year old; and muſt we let ſo new, ſo falſe, and ſo ſingular an Opinion paſs without controul? As to <hi>rectifying Mistakes,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> and Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> do not charge the Diſſenters with any, both of them juſtifie their way; ſo that it ſeems the Church alone is miſtaken either in uſing or enjoyning her Liturgy, and they would have her give
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93476:4"/>
it up for their ſakes, who would never make one ſtep towards her for the ſake of Peace. But Men ſo wofully miſtaken as Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> and Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> are very unfit to rectifie the practice of this and all other regular Churches, ſince they cannot make out any miſtake in this Matter. The miſtakes lie on the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters ſide, which alſo had been long ſince removed; if their own Paſtors, and ſome of ours, had not flattered and ſupported them in their Errors. That falſe repreſentation of the ſtate of the Queſtion, with which the Preface concludes, muſt be charged upon Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> who miſled his Friend, and therefore it ſhall be conſidered in the Diſcourſe. I have now done with the Armour-bearer, and proceed to the Champion, who fights againſt that ſide under which ('tis ſaid) he takes double Pay.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of the grounds for Liturgies in Scripture.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§. 1. Pag. 1. MAſter <hi>S. B.</hi> begins with an aſſurance, <hi>He hath read my Book,</hi> and a promiſe, <hi>that he will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear Reflections.</hi> I have given a Reaſon already why I doubt the Firſt, and his whole Book confutes the Second; for it abounds with Reflections, not only on my Cauſe, but on my Perſon, my Office, my Qualifications, &amp;c. but they are ſo groundleſs, I can eaſily forgive them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 2. But I cannot excuſe him for telling his Prefacer and the World, that I undertook to prove <hi>Liturgies</hi> were only and invariably uſed in the firſt Three Centuries. For this was not needful for me to undertake, either to Anſwer Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> who gave me the liberty of the firſt Five or Six Centuries to prove this: Or to carry on my main deſign, which was (as I declared in my Introduction) <hi>to collect in every Century ſuch Teſtimonies of the Original, Uſe, and Antiquity of Liturgies, as the Argument needed.</hi> Now every proof of a Form frequently or conſtantly uſed in the Three firſt Centuries, the Ages of Inſpiration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church was ſetled, tends to illuſtrate the Hiſtory of <hi>Liturgies,</hi> which began firſt by the voluntary uſe of Forms, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93476:4"/>
by degrees, as the Church drew nearer to a Settlement, to the conſtant and invariable uſe of many Forms, even to the uſe of a whole Liturgy, before theſe Three Centuries were ended: Which had ſo few Writers, and thoſe ſay ſo little of the Forms themſelves, that I declared beforehand, this Evidence muſt be made up of particular and probable Proofs; all which put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would amount to theſe Concluſions; That Forms were uſed from the beginning, and ſo were ancient and lawful (which ſome Diſſenters deny); and that it is very probable, whole Liturgies were both preſcribed and uſed before the end of this Period: Which is a ſufficient foundation for the Evidence in the Fourth Century, That (when the Church was ſetled) Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies were then enjoyned, and invariably uſed. I am forced to be the larger in the diſcovery of this Fallacy, becauſe nothing he hath ſaid would look like an Anſwer, if he did not every where repeat this piece of Sophiſtry, and ſet aſide my Proofs, only becauſe they did not reach his Point, as he had falſly ſtated it.</p>
               <p>Again, He ſuppoſes I was only to Anſwer Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> and on that occaſion determines what I was to prove, and what not. He ſaith, <hi>Mr.</hi> Cl. <hi>doth not aſſert Forms to be intrinſically Evil;</hi> but ſome Diſſenters do, (tho this Opinion reflect upon Jeſus, who taught a Form to his Diſciples) and Forms being the parts of Liturgy, to confute thoſe who condemn all Forms, and juſtifie the foundation of Liturgies, in a Hiſtory of them it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to prove Forms lawful. 2ly, Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> denies not, <hi>that there were arbitrary and particular Forms of old:</hi> And did not I diſprove all his particular Inſtances of arbitrary Forms, and ſhew they were conſtantly uſed and fixed in every Eminent Church? 3dly, <hi>Mr.</hi> Cl. <hi>owns the Lords Prayer was uſed anciently, though far otherwiſe than of late.</hi> This I conſidered alſo, proving the uſe of it as a Form, and the annexing it to all ſolemn Offices, as it is uſed now. 4ly, He grants <hi>divers Churches agreed in a certain Order, to adminiſter the ſeveral parts of Worſhip.</hi> And I proved, this Order could be nothing but a preſcribed Liturgy, <hi>Par. II. Chap. 4. pag.</hi> 201. Now, if he will be anſwering a Book before he have read it over, I cannot help that. 5ly, Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> ſaith, <hi>They prayed for the ſame things, but not in the ſame words.</hi> But I ſhewed, his Inſtances were miſtaken, and that in the ſame Church many parts of Service were in the ſame words. 6ly, Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> declares,

he meant by preſcribed Forms, <hi>ſuch as are impoſed on the Miniſter, ſo as thoſe and no-other muſt be uſed, without adding, detracting, or tranſpoſing.</hi> This is indeed the ſtricteſt Notion of an enjoyned Liturgy; yet I agreed with Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> as to this definition, only we differed about the time when Forms began to be thus enjoyned; he affirmed it was not ſooner than the end of the Fifth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury; I proved, many Forms were invariably uſed in the firſt Three Centuries, and enjoyned in the Fourth and beginning of the Fifth Centuries, which ſufficed to confute Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> So that Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> calls on me to do that which I had done before; and though he meddle with nothing but the firſt Three Centuries, where I was only to ſhew what ſteps were made towards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned Forms in this ſtrict Senſe, he moſt diſingenuouſly brags, <hi>That my Quotations reach not my Point, unleſs they prove Forms enjoyned in the ſtrictest Senſe, in theſe Centuries; which were Ages of Inſpiration, and before the Church was ſetled.</hi> Now this bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced Fallacy takes away two whole Centuries which Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> had freely given me to prove ſuch enjoyned Forms, and ſtarts a New Queſtion, being deſigned meerly to prepoſſeſs his Reader againſt all my probable Proofs, and all my Inſtances of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant uſe of Forms of all kinds, yea, againſt the invariable uſe of a whole Liturgy, under the falſe pretence, That I undertook to prove (by every particular Quotation) that Forms, yea, Liturgies were ſtrictly enjoyned throughout theſe Ages. But I appeal to my Introduction, to <hi>Par. I. pag.</hi> 77. and to all my Inferences, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I undertook to do this in this Period, or no? and the Candid Reader ſhall judge, whether it was neceſſary for me to do all this, to confute Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> who ſaid ſuch enjoyned Forms came not in till 200 years after Mr. <hi>S. B</hi>'s Period was ended; though after all, to compleat my Hiſtory, I have found divers Proofs, that ſhew enjoyned Forms in the ſtricteſt ſenſe in theſe Ages.</p>
               <p>Before I proceed to examine his Particulars, I ſhall requite theſe general Obſervations of his, by ſome general Remarks on the proceedings of both my Adverſaries:</p>
               <p>Firſt, Neither of them hath produced one poſitive Evidence, ſo much as of the uſe of arbitrary or extempore Prayer; they offer nothing but remote Conjectures and very ſlender Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities for it, in this Period. Now, I have brought expreſs proof of the uſe of Forms, in this time; and more (as well as clearer)
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93476:5"/>
Probabilities of the invariable uſe of Forms: So that doubtleſs the advantage is on my ſide, and 'tis not fair to demand ſuch Evidence as the Times do not afford, and ſuch as they cannot bring either againſt my Opinion, or for their own.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Tho' there be not many Proofs of a Whole Liturgy preſcribed before the 4th Century, yet then divers Liturgies were written down, and at that time claimed an Original much elder, either from the Apoſtles or very ancient Tradition; And the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors who ſpeak of them, or any parts of them, ſuppoſe them to have been in uſe long before this time. Wherefore (according to S. <hi>Augustine) That which is obſerved by the whole Church, and was not inſtituted by Councils, but hath been always kept; this is accounted to be of Apoſtolical Inſtitution. De Bapt. contr.</hi> Donat. <hi>l. 4. c.</hi> 23. which being applied to <hi>Liturgies,</hi> will go a great way to prove their Original was from the Apoſtles; however, they muſt be elder than this Fourth Century.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, When Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> and my Examiner have granted Forms ancient and lawful, it ſeems to me very needleſs to enquire when the Church firſt enjoyned them: For if the Church have power to enjoyn any thing in Gods Service, it cannot be in things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful; ſo that whatever is in it ſelf lawful, eſpecially if it be Primitive, and (in her Opinion) uſeful, ſhe may enjoyn to her own Members, and then it becomes neceſſary to them; and if they forſake her Communion for this, they are Schiſmaticks: So that they ſhould have denied the lawfulneſs of Forms, if they deſigned to quarrel at the enjoyning them.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Since Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> ſets up for an Examiner, he ſhould have enquired into all thoſe Pages where my probable Proofs and Inferences are ſtrengthned with explicatory and collateral Evidence: To let all theſe paſs by unanſwered, and tell us, He thinks the Author meant otherwiſe, without confuting my Reaſons and Inſtances, or confirming his own Thoughts, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing too aſſuming.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, He often appeals to his Friend (whom he knew to be of his ſide) or to the Reader, to judge between Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> and me, upon his bare Inſinuation, that I am in the wrong, referring them to both our Books: Out of which, no doubt, the indifferent Reader would have judged more impartially, if no Examiner had appeared. But if they muſt have this trouble ſtill, eſpecially
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93476:6"/>
in the moſt difficult Caſes, I would fain know, to what purpoſe did Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> write his <hi>Examination?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sixthly,. He boaſts as if the Cauſe were loſt, when he thinks he hath run down but one of my particular Inſtances, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Proofs. But there are ſo many Evidences, and ſuch variety of this kind of Proofs, which being put together, make out the general Concluſion, That the Cauſe cannot ſuffer much, though ſome particular Inſtance ſhould fail.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, He rejects all my clear Proofs, That Hymns <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd Praiſes were in preſcribed Forms, as wholly impertinent to the Queſtion, accuſing me of needleſs Tautologies for urging them: Whereas the greateſt part of <hi>Liturgies</hi> are Praiſes; and whatever proves the <hi>Praiſes</hi> were preſcribed Forms, undeniably proves at leaſt, one half of the Public Service was preſcribed; and makes it probable the petitionary part of the ſame Service was ſo alſo (as I ſhewed before, <hi>Par.</hi> I. <hi>pag.</hi> 24, 25.) Nor can he evade this conſequence till he give a ſubſtantial Reaſon, why the Laudatory part of a Liturgy ſhould be in Forms preſcribed, and the Prayers left arbitrary; Which will be very hard to do, becauſe Prayers and Praiſes are ſo intermixed, as to be inſeparable. <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Devotions were Prayers and Thankſgivings, <hi>Dan.</hi> vi. 10. The Apoſtles praying, ſang a Hymn, <hi>Acts</hi> xvi. 25. Our Lord joyned a Doxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy to his Prayer, <hi>Math.</hi> vi. 13. S. <hi>Paul</hi> often puts Prayer and Praiſe together, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiv. 15. <hi>Philip.</hi> iv. 6. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> v. 17, 18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 1. The moſt ancient Forms of Prayer (like the Lords Prayer) end with a Doxology, and the moſt famous Hymns, the <hi>Te Deum Gloria in excelſis,</hi> the <hi>Triſagion,</hi> and thoſe in <hi>Prudentius, &amp;c.</hi> And the Pſalms of <hi>David</hi> are ſo mixt of Prayers and Praiſes, that none can ſing or ſay them, but they bleſs God and pray to him by the ſame Form: So that Praiſes and Prayers being eſſential parts of the ſame Worſhip, ſo like each other, ſo often inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably mixed together, and ſo conſtantly united, What reaſon can be given, why the Hymns and Praiſes being certainly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, the Prayers ſhould not be ſo alſo? And to reject all that proves the Praiſes were preſcribed Forms, as impertinent to a Hiſtory of Liturgy, ſhews much Ignorance or Inconſideration, unleſs it be a politick invention to cover his inability, to anſwer ſo much and ſo clear Evidence as there is on that ſubject. Theſe general Remarks will help to ſhorten my Anſwer, and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:93476:6"/>
ſo I hope may obtain the Readers pardon, though they look like a digreſſion.</p>
               <p>§. 2. <hi>Pag.</hi> 3. My aim from Scripture was to prove, Forms were not only uſed, but alſo enjoyned as an acceptable way of praiſing God, and praying to him. And I produced three Forms, one of Praiſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> xv. 1. another of Bleſſing, <hi>Numb.</hi> vi. 23. a third of Prayer, <hi>Deut.</hi> xxvi. 5, &amp;c. <hi>&amp; ver.</hi> 13. Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> objects nothing to any of the particulars; but ſaith, <hi>I ſhould prove, they did not, or might not uſe any Prayers or Praiſes, but thoſe very Forms.</hi> And ſurely this appears ſufficiently as to the occaſions upon which theſe words were preſcribed, becauſe they were all compoſed by <hi>Moſes,</hi> upon the ſeveral occaſions mentioned in the Text, and that by Gods direction: Now can we ſuppoſe that any private Prieſt durſt make another Form of Bleſſing, or any <hi>Jew</hi> offer his Tithes and Firſt-fruits with a new Form of his own Compoſing? <hi>Fagius</hi> ſaith, <hi>They were ſo ſtrict as to the Bleſſing, that in after-Ages they kept the very Hebrew Original words.</hi> Vid. <hi>Crit. Sacr. in Numb.</hi> 6. And when God by his inſpired Prophet <hi>(Hoſ.</hi> xiv. 2, 3.) not only directs the penitent Jews, what ſort of words to uſe, but ſets down the Form it ſelf; No doubt if any of them had preſumed to alter thoſe words, his preſumption would have cauſed him to be rejected. Wherefore Forms (which no private Man may vary) are a way of ſerving God, juſtified by the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 4. The ſame appears by the Pſalms, indited by the Spirit of God for the public ſervice of the Temple, which I proved by Scripture; and Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> denies it not, only he ſaith, <hi>From Gods enjoyning theſe, we cannot infer, that Men may deviſe Prayers, and oblige the Church to uſe them and no other.</hi> But can Men find out a better way of ſerving God, than that which God himſelf choſe, that is, by Forms enjoyned? 'Tis true, they had Inſpired men to compoſe thoſe Forms then; but though the Authors of ours were not Inſpired, yet if their Compoſures do agree in all things with Holy Scripture, and contradict it in nothing, they cannot offend (ſuppoſing the Forms unexceptionable) by imitating that Method which God and inſpired Ages have ſet them, which is, enjoyning Forms taken out of the Pſalms, and other places of Holy Scripture, and out of ſuch ancient Compoſures as are no
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:93476:7"/>
way repugnant to it. But further, I cited ſix learned Authors in the Margen, and two in the Text, to prove the Jews anciently had a Liturgy. Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> knew the thing could not be denied, wherefore he politickly pretends, <hi>It would be too great a diverſion to enquire whether their proofs are ſolid;</hi> and intimates, he could ſhew, <hi>that two of my Authors build their proof for ſome things upon unjustifiable Authorities.</hi> This is to evade, not to anſwer. Surely it was the buſineſs of an Examiner to enquire; and to ſay he can do that which he doth not, when there was a juſt occaſion for it, is an intimation he cannot anſwer their proofs: So that I ſhall take it for granted, the Jews had a Liturgy (till the contrary be better made out) and refer the Reader to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences deduced from that Truth, <hi>Hiſt. of Lit. pag.</hi> 4. and at laſt Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> ſuppoſes, that Forms might have been of general uſe among the Jews: And then the next queſtion is, <hi>Whether this way of ſerving God was abrogated in the New Teſtament?</hi> I I gave divers Reaſons why ſuch an abrogation was neceſſary, if Chriſt had diſliked that way to which the Jews had been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and long accuſtomed, and intended to ſet up a new one. He anſwers, that <hi>he ſees no neceſſity of ſuch an abrogation, to war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant People to addreſs themſelves to God in another way;</hi> for he ſuppoſes <hi>both ways lawful.</hi> Now if he grant that, <hi>Firſt;</hi> Then the way of ſtinted Forms is not unlawful nor unſuitable to Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-worſhip: <hi>Secondly,</hi> This way was never diſliked by Chriſt, nor hath he brought any proof, that he inſtituted any other way: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Therefore it is moſt likely the Jewiſh Converts would keep to their old way of ſtinted Forms, and that implies them to be very ancient: <hi>Fourthly,</hi> If both ways were now equally lawful, yet the Church having choſen and enjoyned the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick way, as the moſt ancient, univerſal and profitable way, and rejected the other; Her determination makes this way (which was only lawful before) to become neceſſary to us, till that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination be revoked.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 5. But Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> foreſees a dreadful conſequence (which he hopes I never thought of) from my arguing, <hi>That the Jews worſhiped God acceptably by ſet Forms, and that Chriſt and his Apostles joyned in that way, and never reproved it;</hi> Ergo, <hi>Chriſtians now must uſe none but the Jewiſh Forms.</hi> This gives occaſion to his pity for thoſe, who by Reading learned Books, entertain No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:93476:7"/>
deſtructive of Chriſtianity. I wiſh this Examiner had read more, or writ leſs; for then the World had not been troubled with long Harangues upon his own imaginations. He cannot deny the Antecedent, all learned Men aſſert it; but this Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is a <hi>Mormo</hi> of his own dreſſing up, which vaniſhes by conſidering, That when Chriſt and his Apoſtles joyned in the Jewiſh Forms, the Temple and Synagogue-worſhip was the lawful eſtabliſhed way of ſerving God: But when the Levitical part of their Religion was altered, that part of their Liturgy which related to it, became unpracticable to Chriſtians, and fell of it ſelf; yet ſtill the Pſalms and the Moral part of the Jewiſh Forms, ſuited the Chriſtian Doctrin, and our Lord had approved of that way; therefore theſe Forms might be, and were retained and imitated by the Primitive Church; and they did this the rather to win the Jews, who (as I noted) never objected, that Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, or the firſt Chriſtians, had ſet up a new way of praying and praiſing God: Wherefore to make ſo many ſpiteful Reflections upon thoſe great men, from whom I borrowed the Antecedent, for the ſhadow of a ſham Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that no Logick can infer from the premiſſes, diſcovers neither a Chriſtian ſpirit, nor common Ingenuity: For no man who conſiders, will think that Chriſt and his Apoſtles joyning in the Jewiſh worſhip before it was fully abrogated, can oblige us to copy out their whole Service after the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Law is dead and long ſince buried.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 6. That Chriſt did collect his Prayer out of the Jewiſh Forms, and order his Diſciples to add it to their other prayers, as a badge of their relation to him, is too ſo true and ſo well proved by variety of learned Men, that Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> inſtead of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the premiſſes, terrifies us with another dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; which is, that <hi>this is a reflection on the infinite wiſdom of the Son of God.</hi> This makes me think of him <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> L. 21. <hi>who thought wickedly God was even ſuch an one as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> Some men fancy, it is a reflection on their gifts and great parts, not to be at liberty to ſhew them in Extempore Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and will needs apply this to the Bleſſed Jeſus, who indeed had the Spirit without meaſure, and was infinitely able to make what new Prayer he pleaſed Extempore. But our Dear Lord deſigned not on all occaſions to ſhew his infinite ability; he came
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93476:8"/>
to teach us humility and ſubmiſſion to innocent Eſtabliſhments, and ſo might judge it more expedient for his Diſciples to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect a Prayer out of the practical part of the Jewiſh Liturgy (endited at firſt by men who had the Spirit of God) than to make a new one: And if they were really endued with his Spirit, who pretend to it, they would follow his Example herein, and not for oſtentation of their imaginary abilities, reject our lawful enjoyned Forms, diſturb our peace, and leave our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. However, ſince it is certain our Lord did collect his Prayer out of the Jewiſh Forms, it is they who make frivolous conſequences from hence who reflect upon him, not they who relate the Matter of Fact, for which doubtleſs our Saviour had excellent Reaſons, and far better perhaps than we are able to aſſign. Like to this is his laft frightful conſequence, <hi>That this would prove our Saviour would have his Followers compoſe Forms, only out of the Liturgy of the Jews.</hi> If he means this of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial part of it, 'tis evidently falſe, for Chriſt did not collect one Petition from thence; if he means from the Moral part of it, I ſee no harm in the conſequence at all; and it is certain the Primitive Chriſtians did uſe the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> the <hi>Hoſannah, Hallelujah, Holy, Holy, Holy, &amp;c.</hi> and other Old Teſtament-Forms in their Service, which were parts of the Jewiſh Liturgy: But it could never be the intent of Chriſt to oblige us to collect our whole Liturgy from thence, becauſe he taught New Doctrins, and inſtituted new Rites, and gave his Apoſtles a miraculous Gift on purpoſe to ſuit new Adminiſtrations, to that which was New in the Chriſtian Religion; and the early agreement of thoſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Churches which they planted, in theſe Adminiſtrations, not only as to the method, but the main words of them, is a good evidence, That the ſame Spirit directed them all to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Forms, from the very beginning.</p>
               <p>§. 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 7. His own looſe conſequences do not diſcourage him from cenſuring me as diſcourſing too looſly. Wherefore having paſſed by our Saviours Hymn, and his Prayer in the Garden, clear inſtances of his chooſing, allowing and uſing Forms both of Prayer and Praiſe. He gives our Saviours Prayer on the Croſs (which (I ſaid) <hi>was probably taken out of Pſal.</hi> xxii.) as an inſtance of my looſe diſcourſing; asking me, <hi>Who put the petitions in Form
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93476:8"/>
for Christ, and obliged him to uſe no other words?</hi> I reply to his Inſinuation, That if my Conjecture be too looſe, he ſhould and might have confuted it; but his not attempting that, ſhews it was cloſe enough. To his Queſtion I anſwer, <hi>David</hi> by the Spirit of Prophecy long before compoſed this Prayer for Chriſt, as appears by his voluntary chooſing of this Form, when he could have made a New prayer; and if my Examiner will allow, he prayed by the Spirit when he uſed this Form, then it is no looſe inference, to ſay, <hi>We may pray by the Spirit in uſing Forms;</hi> and to affirm, <hi>It is no hardſhip to enjoyn men to ſerve God in that way which Jeſus choſe as the beſt, when he was free from all conſtraint, and infinitely more able than any of us to have prayed otherwiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In my <hi>8th page,</hi> I proved by S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi> That the Apoſtles both uſed and ſetled Forms; and from others, that <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed Forms had been uſed from the Apoſtolical times.</hi> Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> (I doubt) thought this too cloſe, and ſo never offers to anſwer it. But when I had granted <hi>the Lords Prayer to be both a Form and a Direction to draw other Forms by;</hi> And, <hi>That Liturgies are other words indeed, but ſuch as are agreeable to it (i. e.</hi> to the Lords Prayer) <hi>both as to the Form and Matter of them:</hi> The Examiner firſt adds <hi>[No]</hi> to my words, and cites them thus, <hi>Liturgies are No other words, &amp;c.</hi> and then inſinuates they are Non-ſenſe, and <hi>an odd Expreſſion to fall from a learned Doctor:</hi> But I am ſure, 'tis <hi>an odd Trick</hi> of a Non-conforming Conformiſt to put <hi>[No]</hi> into the midſt of a Sentence, to be ſo greedy of making reflections (after his promiſe to the contrary) that he falfies my words, to get an opportunity. The adding <hi>[No]</hi> to Scripture it ſelf, may make it non-ſenſe or blaſphemy; and if I ſhould add it to his Preface, and ſay, <hi>He is no Conformiſt, he uſeth not the Liturgy;</hi> ſome think I had not done him much wrong, though he would no doubt have reſented it. Well, leave out <hi>[No]</hi> then here, and my ſenſe is plain, That Liturgies are other words, different in ſyllables from the Lords Prayer, but agreeing to it, both as to the Form or method of the Petitions, and as to the Subject matter of them, which I proved by an induction of particulars, <hi>pag.</hi> 10. to which he doth not vouchſafe any anſwer: But upon my granting, the Lords Prayer was a Direction as well as a Form, he asks a notable Queſtion, and repeats it again, <hi>pag.</hi> 9. viz. <hi>Why may not à Miniſter
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93476:9"/>
keeping to the words of the Lords Prayer, uſe other words than thoſe in the Liturgy, as well as the Liturgy-men uſe other words than thoſe in the Lords Prayer?</hi> this had been cloſe, if he had not forgot our Miniſters circumſtances. The Church hath drawn up a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy very carefully, following the direction of the Lords Prayer, and (for ſuch Reaſons as he may find in my 2d Part, <hi>pag.</hi> 325) enjoyned all Miniſters to uſe it conſtantly, and they have (ſincerely I hope) conſented thereto. Now to ask his Queſtion in our caſe, is to ask, why every Captain, who thinks himſelf wiſer than his ſuperior Officer, may not croſs the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders given by his General, or a Council of War, and give new ones to his own Company. He muſt find out ſome Reaſon as New as an Extempore prayer, to prove that private Miniſters in a ſetled Church, ought to have liberty to do all thoſe Acts which their Governors may do, before his Queſtion can concern us, or be worth anſwering.</p>
               <p>To go on, Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> brought many Authorities to ſhew, that the ancient Chriſtians uſed the Lords prayer not out of any apprehenſion that it was enjoyned, <hi>Math.</hi> vi. Theſe Quotations I examined particularly, and ſhewed they were not ſufficient for his purpoſe. <hi>Mr. S. B.</hi> who loves not to meddle with reading, inſtead of examining my Anſwers, refers the Reader to examine them himſelf; only among eight Authors he picks out <hi>Maldo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat,</hi> whoſe ſenſe (without citing his very words) I ſaid was only, <hi>That we are not always bound to uſe the very words of the Lords Prayer:</hi> And <hi>Maldonat</hi> doth not only ſay, <hi>Non his neceſſariò verbis—,</hi> but <hi>ut quotieſcunque oramus—omnia, aut aliqua, aut nihil certe his contrarium peteremus.</hi> However <hi>Mr. S. B.</hi> conceives his Senſe to be, <hi>That we are not abſolutely bound to uſe thoſe very words at any time:</hi> Which not only contradicts <hi>Maldonat</hi>'s words, but ſhews my Examiner did not know this Author was a Jeſuit, and a rigid Papiſt, bound by the Rules of his Church and Order to ſay ſo many <hi>Paternoſters</hi> every Day; otherwiſe he could not have aſſerted this Jeſuit ſo openly turned Fanatick, as to affirm in a Book which was to paſs the Cenſors, <hi>That no man is bound at any time to ſay a Pater-Noster:</hi> He follows this with a notable Queſtion (which Examiners and ſome others claim a priviledge to ask) <hi>viz. If we be not always bound to uſe the Lords words, how we came to be bound to uſe always other peoples words?</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:93476:9"/>
I reply, We of this Church are bound to uſe the Lords Prayer as often as we uſe the Liturgy in public; and ſincere Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formiſts deliberately bound themſelves to uſe the Lords words and the Churches too in all their public Adminiſtrations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving them to be fitter for thoſe occaſions than any they can invent. How Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> came to be bound, he knows beſt, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps Advantage drew him to do that which he now diſlikes; but he ſhould have asked this Queſtion before, and then he had eſcaped the Snare <hi>of making enquiry after Vows,</hi> Prov. xx. 25.</p>
               <p>§. 4. <hi>pag.</hi> 8. I had owned there was an extraordinary Gift of Prayer in the Apoſtles times and long after, which I obſerved, none could claim by Scripture in this Age, and anſwered all the places produced by ſome for this claim, in four or five Pages: To which Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> gives no Anſwer, but is very large in giving us his own Notion of the Gift of Prayer, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines, <hi>An ability to repreſent the ſentiments of a Soul duly affected with the general and particular matter of prayer in ſuitable Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, proper to beget and improve ſuch affections and reſentments in thoſe, who ſhall hear and joyn in the uſe of them to that purpoſe.</hi> A Logician can no more reduce this definition to his Rules of Art, than he can give a regular Analyſis of an Extempore prayer; yet, if I admit it for a deſcription, my Cauſe is not hurt, ſince (according to this Character) he that reads the Liturgy doth exerciſe the Gift of prayer, as well or better than the Extempore man. For our Clergy and well inſtructed People, upon rational grounds believe, the Expreſſions of the Liturgy to be more proper, than they or any can invent or utter on the ſudden, without the extraordinary aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt: So that every pious Miniſter of our Church hath his Soul duly affected with the general and particular matter of Prayer, and an ability to repreſent the ſentiments of his Soul in expreſſions, ſuitable and proper to beget and improve ſuch affections and reſentments in all the true lovers of Common-Prayer, who hear and joyn with him. Wherefore by his account the Diſſenters have no monopoly of this <hi>Gift of Prayer;</hi> and if our hearts be duly affected we have more title to it than they; for our Expreſſions have been all duly weighed by Admirable men, and we may know the general and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:93476:10"/>
matter of them before-hand, by meditating whereon our Souls may be more affected than any can rationally be ſuppoſed to be, by an Expreſſion that flies by like a flaſh of Lightning. 'Tis true, Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> denies, that ſuch as pray Extempore, expect the aſſiſtance of the Spirit only to teach them new words and phraſes for their daily prayers: But (as he ſtates the point) the only difference between their exerciſe of this Gift and ours, is this, They frequently or daily vary the phraſes, and we uſe the ſame: As to the propriety of expreſſions, affections, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments, we and our people have the advantage: And ſay what he will, he lays great weight upon new phraſes, for he affirms, <hi>The exerciſe of this Gift cannot well conſiſt with an obligation constantly to uſe the ſame words.</hi> The abſurdity of which appears; Firſt, By the cenſure this paſſes upon him, who (if this be true) when he ſubſcribed and declared, renounced the uſe of one of Gods gifts: Secondly, By the ſentence it paſſes upon all ſincere Conformiſts, who (by this account) do never pray by the Spirit, meerly for want of new expreſſions, though their expreſſions be never ſo proper, their Souls never ſo much affected and their People never ſo devout: So that I may refer it to the Reader, whether he hath abuſed himſelf or his Brethren more by this raſh expreſſion.</p>
               <p>Now when he had made new phraſes the diſtinguiſhing Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the Gift of prayer, he did well to ſay, <hi>It is no extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Gift:</hi> For it is a meer natural faculty, depending on mens parts and temper, attained by confidence and uſe, like the Art of making Speeches An eaſie Obſerver may ſee, that the fluency, the variety, and the ſtyle, follow the complection and diſpoſition of the Speaker; the Sanguin are brisk and aiery in theſe prayers, the Flegmatic, ſlow and flat; the Choleric, bold and fierce; the Melancholy, ſad and diſmal; yea, the ſame man is quicker or ſlower, as his Body or Mind is well or ill-diſpoſed: So that no conſidering perſon will aſcribe ſuch a Quality as this to the Spirit of God; There being no promiſe, that God will aſſiſt us in public Prayer with new phraſes; and it is a great preſumption to expect that which God never promiſed, and a greater, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe the effects of mens natural tempers, to the operation of the Holy Ghoſt. What he adds, <hi>That Men have ordinarily a readineſs to expreſs their Senſe in proper words,</hi> is not true in the caſe of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:93476:10"/>
public Prayer; for many pious and learned Miniſters, who have a very affectionate ſenſe of the matter of Prayer, cannot expreſs themſelves ſuitably to their inward reſentments, (as he calls it) yet many Ignorants or Hypocrites, who have no ſenſe of him they ſpeak to, or that they pray for, can expreſs themſelves fluently on any occaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 9. It is a Paradox to me, when there are very pertinent words, <hi>how other words, only equally pertinent, ſhould contribute more to the ends of public Worſhip:</hi> His inſtance of the Lords Prayer and Liturgies will not make it out; the Lords Prayer is more pertinent for thoſe occaſions for which Chriſt made it, than any human Compoſure can be: But our Lord deſigned not this ſhort Prayer for the whole Service, but to be added to our other Prayers, and to direct the Church to frame other Prayers by it; and our Church hath obſerved both theſe orders. He hath been told already, why every private Miniſter cannot have the ſame liberty, that the Governours of a ſetled Church have: As for his ſuppoſing theſe Miniſters would vary no more from the Lords Prayer (if they had liberty) than the Liturgy doth; firſt this is very unlikely, becauſe ſome of thoſe who take this liberty, neither uſe the Lords Prayer as a Form, nor mind it as a dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for their Extempore prayers: And ſecondly, the project is impracticable among 10000 Clergy-men; for ſome are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have a liberty of varying, others are unfit to be truſted with it, in which number are many who (through a conceit of their own abilities) deſire it; and there are but very few who are fit to be allowed ſuch a liberty, that do preſs for it. Wherefore ſince this liberty cannot be granted to all, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing would be ſo difficult, and the denying it to ſome ſo exaſperating, that it is better to reſtrain a few from the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their needleſs gifts, (where we have already properer Expreſſions than any of them can invent) than to bring all thoſe miſchiefs on a ſetled Church, which either a general al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, or a diſtinguiſhing diſpenſation muſt create.</p>
               <p>His ſecond illuſtration of the aforeſaid Paradox, is by my Paraphraſes on the Common-Prayer, by which I thought to further devotion: <hi>And if they be of real uſe</hi> (he asks) <hi>why may not other variations be in their meaſure uſeful too?</hi> I reply, That Commentaries and Paraphraſes on Scripture (for private uſe)
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:93476:11"/>
are very advantagious. But if Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> or the Aſſembly, had drawn up their Paraphraſes and Notes on purpoſe to be read in Churches, to exclude the reading of Scripture there, out of a conceit, they were more uſeful than reading Chapters of the Bible, they would have been ridiculous, and deſerved a ſevere Cenſure: So in Human Compoſures, <hi>Durandus</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſila</hi>'s explications of the Liturgies, and the expoſition of the Canons by <hi>Balſamon</hi> and <hi>Zonaras</hi> are uſeful in private. But if theſe Authors had deſigned to have their Expoſitions publicly uſed, ſo as to juſtle out the old Liturgies and Canons, they would have been deſpiſed for their inſolence, as much as they are now commended for their induſtry. Now his Extempore men would have their variations only and always uſed in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic inſtead of the Liturgy, ſo as utterly to exclude it, which ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſpoils the parallel: This he perceived, and therefore owns, <hi>That my Variations are not to be uſed publicly,</hi> pag. 10. I ask, why then did he inſtance in them, ſince he himſelf affirms, <hi>pag. 11. The matter now in diſpute is only about him that officiates?</hi> But my Paraphraſes being not at all intended for the uſe of Miniſters, or others in public, therefore they are nothing to the purpoſe <hi>of Variations deſigned for public uſe, excluſive of the Liturgy.</hi> His next Queſtion is, <hi>Whether my Paraphraſes be ever the better for being only for private uſe?</hi> I anſwer, This makes his alledging them in an Argument about publick Variations, appear frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and impertinent: But if he delight in Compariſons, a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Miniſter, who makes Variations for private uſe, to promote Uniformity and Devotion, and to beget in all a juſt eſteem of the eſtabliſhed way of Worſhip, doth much better than he, who to ſhew his ability to vary; uſes his faculty in public, to exclude the eſtabliſhed way, and thereby breeds a contempt of it, and promotes ſeparation from it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 10. I granted <hi>(pag. 16.) That every good man might pray, by the ordinary aſſiſtance of the Spirit, devoutly and fervently even by a Form:</hi> Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> leaves out the main words <hi>[even by a Form]</hi> and falls to make Inferences from half my Sentence, asking, <hi>If Men may be ſo enlightned and affected, &amp;c. why they may not by the ordinary aſſiſtance of the Spirit expreſs their reſentments in proper Expreſſions?</hi> If he mean, <hi>in private,</hi> perhaps they may; but that is nothing to our Queſtion, which is only about public Prayer;
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:93476:11"/>
if he mean in public, I have already given him divers Reaſons why this cannot be permitted, much leſs eſtabliſhed in a ſetled Church: But in ſhort, I will give him here three Reaſons; Firſt, This liberty is needleſs, becauſe there are more proper Expreſſions already compoſed by Holy men (who had the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary aſſiſtance of the Spirit) than any of us can invent on the ſudden. Secondly, This liberty would be pernicious, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning Envy among the Clergy, and Factions among the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; ſome of the moſt learned and pious would be deſpiſed only for their modeſty; and others of the moſt ignorant and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, admired for their fluency and confidence. Thirdly, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing both ways of praying by enjoyned Forms and Extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore were equal; yet when our Church (being guided by anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, reaſon, and the practice of other modern Churches) hath prohibited that way, and preſcribed Forms, they are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the better way for us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 11. He yields at laſt, <hi>That the frame and actings of the Soul, the exerciſe of Faith, Repentance, Love, &amp;c. are the principal thing in Prayer.</hi> Now when I had proved, that a Miniſter may do all this, and ſo pray by the Spirit in a Form; why may he not be obliged always to uſe a Form in public? Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> can object nothing but this, <hi>If the enjoyned Form do not ſo well expreſs that ſenſe, which he and others have of the Matter of Prayer, as other words which occur to him, then he cannot be ſaid to pray in or by the Spirit, in the full import of the phraſe.</hi> Now this Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhews, firſt, That theſe men have a high opinion of their own Invention, who think they can deviſe better words Extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore, than our Reverend makers of the Liturg<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> could frame by much ſtudy: Secondly, 'Tis plain, <hi>That uſing theſe new Phraſes is</hi> (by his account) <hi>the full and only import of Praying by the Spirit;</hi> for he makes varying the phraſe neceſſary to the exerciſe of it, and his Extempore man is ſingular in nothing elſe. But he ſhould conſider, this is a Scripture-phraſe, and the import of it is to be learned from thence; wherefore he ſhould have brought ſome Text, where <hi>Praying by the Spirit,</hi> ſignifies, <hi>Inventing new Phraſes,</hi> but that he can never do; and reaſon is againſt his Expoſition, as well as Scripture; for ſince he owns <hi>new Words</hi> not to be the principal thing in Prayer, no man will believe the Spirits aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is neceſſary for the leſs principal; yea, (where we have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93476:12"/>
proper Phraſes already) for a needleſs thing. Wherefore when in the uſe of our Forms our Soul is in good frame, and we exerciſe all proper Graces, by the aſſiſtance of the Spirit; we <hi>Pray by the Spirit,</hi> in all Senſes that the phraſe is capable of, but Two, which are of Mr. <hi>S. B</hi>'s own deviſing; firſt, that we do not daily invent new Words; nor ſecondly, do we vainly imagine we can invent more proper Words, than the Church hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</p>
               <p>After this he runs back to my <hi>15th Page,</hi> where I had ſhewed, That if Praying by the Spirit ſignifie, <hi>making new Words and Phraſes, then none but the Minister, in public, prays by the Spirit, ſince the people never invent new Words, but the Miniſters words are a Form to them.</hi> The Examiner tugs hard to get off from this Rock, and ſaith firſt, <hi>The diſpute is only about him that officiates.</hi> But had he read over the place he pretends to confute, he muſt have ſeen I was anſwering Mr. <hi>Clarkſon,</hi> who <hi>(Diſc. of Lit. pag.</hi> 128, 129.) makes <hi>Praying by the Spirit,</hi> a gift common to all Chriſtians; and yet afterwards ſaith, <hi>He that was able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a Prayer himſelf, yet made uſe of prayers formed by others; he did not pray as he was able;</hi> which he makes to be all one with <hi>praying by the Spirit.</hi> The abſurdity of which Aſſertion I proved by this ſcandalous Conſequence of it, that then the People (whom he affirms to have this Gift in all Ages) did never pray by the Spirit, becauſe they make uſe of Forms made by others; ſo that here our diſpute was about the People. For by this I made it appear, how falſly they expounded the phraſe of <hi>praying by the Spirit,</hi> by <hi>inventing new Words;</hi> which excludes the People from ever praying by the Spirit at all. Secondly, Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Miniſters prayer is not a Form to the Congregation in the Senſe we are diſcourſing of.</hi> I anſwer, <hi>It is a prayer framed by another,</hi> and that is Mr. <hi>Clarkſon</hi>'s ſenſe of a Form, and (I think) Mr. <hi>S. B</hi>'s too, who ſaith in this very Page, if a man <hi>reſtrain himſelf to the words and phraſes put together by others, which expreſs not their ſenſe ſo well as ſome that occur to them, &amp;c.</hi> Here a Form is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, <hi>Words and Phraſes put together by others,</hi> and the uſing it, <hi>reſtraining ones ſelf to thoſe words.</hi> Now the people are reſtrained to words and phraſes put together by the Miniſter, therefore his Prayer is a Form to them: And if one of the Congregation conceive, he can expreſs his ſenſe better than his Miniſter doth,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:93476:12"/>
and yet ſits by ſilent, and uſes the Miniſters words to expreſs his ſenſe; according to Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> this man doth not pray <hi>as well as he is able;</hi> and according to Mr. <hi>S. B. he prays not by the Spirit in the full import of the phraſe;</hi> which natural, yet odious Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ſhould make them aſhamed of their explaining this phraſe of <hi>Praying by the Spirit,</hi> by <hi>inventing new Expreſſions.</hi> Thirdly, Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Congregation may joyn in the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual performance of the duty, acting Graces ſuitable to the occaſions, and improving others abilities to further their Devotion.</hi> This, he deſigns to prove, That the Miniſters prayer is not a Form to the People; but I affirm, the Congregation (who joyn in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer) do, or may do all this; yet I hope Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> will not affirm, that their joyning in the Spiritual performance, acting Graces, and uſing the abilities of the Liturgy-makers to further their Devotion, proves the Common-Prayer is no Form to our People. Laſtly, he affirms, <hi>That the Congregation are not called to expreſs vocally their inward reſentments in the fitteſt words they are able.</hi> I reply, They are commanded <hi>to pray by the Spirit in public, as well as in private;</hi> and if they may not uſe their own Expreſſions there, then they may pray by the Spirit, without uſing their own words; and praying fervently is the main im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of that phraſe. Beſides, he runs from the point, to tell us what is the duty of Miniſters, and what the Peoples: For our Queſtion here is, Whether their being tied to their Miniſters Prayer, do not make it a Form to them? not, Whether they ſhould be tied to his words, or no? If I grant, they ought to be tied to his words, that makes them not leſs a Form to them; but I may note, that he cannot produce one place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture where (as he phraſes it) Miniſters are called to ſpeak all the Office alone, or to expreſs their ſenſe in new phraſes daily, or where the People are forbid to ſay any part of the Prayers: If he cannot ſhew Scripture for theſe ways of the Diſſenters, he is highly to blame to apply the Canting-phraſe of, <hi>A Call</hi> (which implies, a <hi>Divine Command) to meer human devices.</hi> 'Tis apparent from the beſt antiquity ſince the Apoſtles, and from the Jewiſh Cuſtom, that the people joyned both in Praiſes and Prayers by Reſponſes, Repetitions, &amp;c. contrary to which the Diſſenters now confine the People wholly to the Miniſters words throughout their Extempore Prayers; and then by a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:93476:13"/>
wrong expoſition of the <hi>praying by the Spirit,</hi> abuſe their own Congregations, as much as they do thoſe who uſe the Liturgy, and exclude them as well as us from Praying by the Spirit.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 12. I granted there was an extraordinary Gift of Prayer, in and after the Apoſtles days, the Spirit furniſhing ſome then both with words and matter: This I proved by S. <hi>Chryſostom,</hi> who notes it was ceaſed long before his time; and I made it probable that the Original of Liturgies, was from Prayers en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited at firſt by theſe Inſpired men, and preſerved in writing by ſome for the benefit of after-Ages, <hi>(Hiſt. Lit. pag.</hi> 17.) Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> objects, That I have none but S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> to vouch for this Gift. And, is not he a good Evidence for a matter of Fact ſo near his own time, when Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> hath not one Father nor Argument to diſprove him? But he ſtartles at a dreadful Conſequence of his own dreſſing up, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>this would make Liturgies, to be Divine Revelations,</hi> which he repreſents as little leſs than Blaſphemy. Now to put him out of his affright, he muſt conſider; Firſt, That there is great difference between Holy Scripture, written by Inſpired men on purpoſe to be a perfect Rule of Faith and Manners, and certainly delivered to us as the very Word of God; and Forms occaſionally uſed or compoſed by ſome Inſpired man, accidentally preſerved, as ſome Liturgick Forms, and ſome Sayings of the Apoſtles (not Recorded in the New Teſtament) were: So that the affirming the Primitive part of Liturgy was made at firſt by Inſpired men, doth not equal it to Scripture. Secondly, This Primitive part of Liturgy, is either the very words of Scripture, or ſo pious, pure, pertinent, and agreeable to it, that it is no refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction on the Spirit of God to ſay, this was derived from the Prayers of Inſpired men. Thirdly, The agreement of diſtant Churches ſo early in the ſame Forms, cannot well be made out, unleſs we allow theſe Forms were made at firſt by that one Spirit, which inſpired all the planters of theſe ſeveral Churches. Laſtly, It is far more arrogant, and nearer Blaſphemy, to aſcribe modern, extempore Prayers to Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, (as the People are taught to do); to charge the Holy Spirit with the blunders, tautologies, non-ſenſe, and imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencies of this way, muſt provoke God with a witneſs. I might alſo here ſhew, that two Popiſh Impoſtors firſt brought
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93476:13"/>
up this way of Extempore prayer in <hi>England,</hi> and that many who were great admirers of it, have fallen off to Quakeriſm, &amp;c. but that is done by other hands <note place="margin">

                  </note>. I return therefore to the Examiner, who adds, <hi>That ſome of our lateſt Liturgies, have ſome Prayers in them, whoſe very frame ſhews they were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by Inſpiration.</hi> If he ſay this of the modern corrupt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to old Liturgies, it is nothing to the purpoſe, becauſe we conſider nothing here but the Primitive part of theſe Liturgies: If he mean it of our Common-Prayer (one of the beſt and lateſt Liturgies) I affirm, the meaneſt Collect there is fitter to be aſcribed to Inſpiration, than the beſt Extempore Prayer I ever heard; yet we do not equal them to Holy Scripture. And now I hope it is plain, my Examiner hath ſaid nothing to leſſen the value of Liturgies, or raiſe the credit of the Extempore way. I will next conſider, whether he hath any better skill of ſucceſs in examining Authors, than in refuting Scripture Arguments.</p>

                  <p>§. 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 13. TO avoid all Cavil, and prevent Fallacies, I will firſt ſhew what I undertook to prove in this Century; which was, <hi>That the Chriſtians had Forms of Prayer and Praiſe,</hi> pag. 21. and <hi>a Liturgy or Order at leaſt,</hi> pag. 22. <hi>That their Hymns were certainly in preſcribed Forms,</hi> pag. 25. <hi>Their Prayer and Supplication one, and approved by the Biſhop; their Singing alternate,</hi> pag. 27. This was all I undertook to prove in an Age ſo full of inſpired Paſtors, and ſo deficient in Writers, wherein (as I noted, <hi>pag.</hi> 19) <hi>much evidence for Liturgies cannot be expected:</hi> And if we find ſome ſteps made towards a Liturgy invariably uſed thus early, we may be ſure, as Gifts decreaſed, the uſe of Forms in every Age muſt proportionably increaſe.</p>
                  <p>My firſt proof is from <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>The Eſſenes uſed early in the Morning, Prayers delivered them from their Fore-fathers, De bell.

He only cavils about <hi>Euſebius</hi>'s not mentioning their Forms of Prayer: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he do not, <hi>Joſephus</hi> (who knew the <hi>Eſſenes</hi> better) affirms, they had Forms of Prayer; ſo that the thing is certainly true and ſufficiently proved.

But Mr. <hi>S.

God hath preſcribed, and at the Seaſon he hath appointed, &amp;c.</hi> he leaves the word <hi>[Oblations]</hi> wholly out, becauſe he could not well wreſt that word to his feigned Senſe of ordinary buſineſs, which the whole Period contradicts, for where did Chriſt require Lay-men to do <hi>all their buſineſs in order? Where hath he preſcribed the manner and ſet-time for Lay-mens Work?</hi> And the next Sentence in <hi>Clemens</hi> baffles this pretence alſo, for he goes on thus,—<hi>The Lord hath not only determined the ſeaſons for theſe, but alſo where and by whom they must be performed;</hi> (Is this true of mens ordinary Callings?)—<hi>So that they who make their Oblations at the ſet-time, are accepted and bleſſed, and cannot err, ſince they obey God—Even as the Chief-Prieſt had his proper Liturgy, appointed the Prieſts and Levites theirs, and the Laity were obliged to Lay-duties,</hi> ('tis not <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> there.) We ſee he compares the Order of the Chriſtian Church to that of the Jews, where there was a preſcribed Rule for the High Prieſt, Prieſts and Levites to officiate by, which he calls a Liturgy, as he had named the Rule for Chriſtian Prieſts performance of Divine Offices before; and the compariſon ſhews as well the ſame word, <hi>That the Chriſtians were preſcribed as well as the Jews;</hi> as alſo he ſuppoſes, Lay-men might not meddle with theſe

Moreover <hi>Pliny</hi> evidently deſcribes all the Service by this word, and whatever it notes (Prayers or Praiſes) 'tis certain they were in Forms, becauſe they ſaid them alternately. And finally, if it do ſignifie Hymns, I gave many Reaſons why the Prayers and the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93476:15"/>
Hymns might be alike; All which to <hi>pag.</hi> 25. (though fit enough to be examined) Mr. <hi>S.

Where it appears, that thoſe <hi>Eſſenes</hi> exactly agreed with <hi>Pliny</hi>'s Chriſtians, firſt, in the uſe of Forms; ſecondly, in uſing them alternately; and, thirdly, in uſing them early in the morning: This is all the agreement I mentioned, and all my Queſtion obliged me to conſider; for this ſtill confirms the early uſe of Forms, and makes it probable thoſe <hi>Eſſenes</hi> were Chriſtians, who had uſed them even from the time of S. <hi>Mark.</hi>

Now then, The Prayer they were to uſe was allowed by the Biſhop, and not ſuch as agreed to private Miniſters fancies; it was One Prayer and Supplication uſed by all in common; all which is the proper deſcription of a Liturgy: Whereas an Extempore Prayer is ſo various, it cannot be approved; that agrees to private and ſingle Miniſters fancies; it is daily varied, and ſo not one; ſpoken by the Miniſter alone, and ſo not repeated by all in common: But a Form is properly one and the ſame

Mr. <hi>S.

FRom that Prayer <hi>which began with the Father, and ended with the Hymn of many Names,</hi> in <hi>Lucian,</hi> where he deſcribes and derides a Chriſtian Aſſembly; I inferred, That the Chriſtians then had Prayers and Hymns known by their proper Titles; which implies, they uſed Forms in public. <hi>Mr. S.

and perhaps he is the firſt and only man that ever did que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion it. Mr. <hi>Mede</hi> cites this very place, to prove the Chriſtians had Churches in <hi>Lucian</hi>'s time; See his <hi>Diſc. of Churches, Tom.</hi> l. <hi>pag.</hi> 22. and the learned Notes of <hi>Wooverus</hi> and <hi>Heraldus</hi> on <hi>Minutius Foelix,</hi> cite this Dialogue of <hi>Lucian,</hi> to prove the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians of that Age were pale with Faſting; <hi>Not. in Min. Foel. pag. 109. Lugd. Bat.</hi> 1672. Secondly, The Examiner thinks <hi>Lucian</hi> here <hi>deſign'd to ridicule Pagan as well as Christian Religion.</hi> I reply, He begins the Dialogue with a Jocular repreſentation of the Arguments uſed by Chriſtians, againſt Swearing by the Heathen gods, with deſign only to render Chriſtianity odious to the Pagans; but the latter part, (whence this paſſage is cited) is wholly taken up in a direct expoſing of Chriſtianity; witneſs his Jeer upon the Name of Chriſt, his mention of Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens, his Scoffing at the Doctrins of the Trinity, Providence, and a Future-ſtate, with his intimating the Chriſtians were a ſort of Magicians: Yea, at laſt <hi>Mr. S. B.</hi> grants, <hi>He might deſign this as a reflection on their way of praying to one perſon firſt, and then concluding as if they prayed to many;</hi> he ſhould have ſaid, <hi>praiſed many:</hi> For the end was, <hi>an Hymn of many Names.</hi> And if this be <hi>Lucian</hi>'s ſenſe, That they had a Prayer beginning with the Father, and a Hymn in the concluſion, called <hi>the Hymn of many Names;</hi> then Chriſtians uſed ſome certain Forms both of Prayer and Praiſe, which had certain beginnings and proper Titles, ſo as ſuch as heard them might give them the Names by which they were commonly known: The Prayer had a certain beginning, and the Hymn (if it were not the <hi>Triſagion)</hi> muſt be in Form, as all Hymns generally were. As for his wonder, how <hi>a Jeering Pagan could be admitted to hear the prayers, which were then concealed from Heathens:</hi> It may be News to him, what <hi>Suidas</hi> and others ſay of <hi>Lucian, That he was a Chriſtian, yea, a Preacher at</hi> Antioch <hi>before his Apoſtacy;</hi> and that enabled him to know all the Doctrin and Worſhip of the Chriſtians. Thought it is not improbable, that the Blaſphemy and Railing of this and other Apoſtates, contributed to make them ſtill more cautious to conceal their Myſteries, of which the next Age affords ſtore of Evidence.</p>

§. 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 19. I obſerved <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſhews ſome inclination this way; for though he write of the Chriſtian Worſhip, yet he gives no account of the particular words uſed in celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it. The Examiner ſaith, <hi>He doth not ſo much as ſay they had Forms.</hi> I reply, I have proved by other Evidence they had Forms, and both Jews and Gentiles then worſhiped God by Forms; ſo that his ſilence argues the Chriſtians had not altered that point, whereas a new way would have needed ſome Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. But he finds me in a great miſtake about Baptiſm, the words of which (he ſaith) <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> relates, <hi>viz. In the Name of the Father of all things, the Lord God, and of our Saviour Chriſt, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> But the miſtake will prove on his ſide, for I ſaw theſe words; but I affirm they are not the very words by which they did Baptize, but a paraphraſe on them (as the learned <hi>Voſſius</hi> declares; See <hi>Hiſt. Lit. par. 2. ch. 4. pag.</hi> 252.) So that this deſcription, as well as that cautious Expreſſion, <hi>of regenerating new Converts, as we were regenerated;</hi> are intended to diſguiſe the myſterious Form, which no ſober man can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the Chriſtians of this early and pure Age ſhould alter ſo much from that which Jeſus preſcribed. And to confirm my Opinion, that <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> was for concealing the words of their worſhip, I obſerve that he ſaith, <hi>The Catechumens were taught to pray.</hi> Now they could not pray without a Form we may be ſure, yet <hi>Juſtin</hi> doth not tell us what this Form was, though the practice of the next Ages aſſure us, it was the Lords Prayer, which the Catechumens learned juſt before Baptiſm. Again, he doth not mention divers Ceremonies of the Euchariſt and Baptiſm; ſuch as the Kiſs of Charity, repeating the Creed, renouncing the Devil, &amp;c. though learned Men believe theſe were in uſe in his time; but he writ to Heathens, and would not give them an account of the particular Rites in Chriſtian wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: And though his general Expreſſions and former Evidence make it out they uſed Forms then, yet I ſaid I would not <hi>inſiſt upon that general account he gives of their Supplications, though theſe Phraſes are found in ancient Litanies.</hi> The modeſty of this ſeems to offend him (who is very rarely guilty of offending on that ſide) and he asks, <hi>Whether ſuch things cannot be pray'd for, but in preſcribed words?</hi> and, <hi>how it-appears</hi> Juſtin M. <hi>borrowed this from any Litany?</hi> A man would think he could expreſly prove, theſe
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:93476:18"/>
things were then prayed for extempore, becauſe he will not allow this for a probable Evidence: But impartial men will conſider, there are other evidences of Forms in this Age, and <hi>One Supplication</hi> in <hi>Ignatius;</hi> as alſo that there were Litanies ſoon after, which were ſo old in the Fourth Century, as to pretend to be compoſed by the Apoſtles: Alſo in them, theſe very things are prayed for in Forms; <hi>viz. The Converſion of the Jews, and the Deliverance of the Gentiles from their Errors, &amp;c.</hi> almoſt in <hi>Justins</hi> very words, who cites them here for a proof of the Chriſtians Charity, in a diſpute with a learned Jew, who would ſcarce have taken arbitrary, uncertain, or extempore Expreſſions for a ſolid proof of Chriſtian uſages: All this, I hope will paſs with moſt men for a probable Evidence, That <hi>Juſtin</hi> did refer to a Form of Supplication.</p>

                     </gap> in the prayers and praiſes at the Communion. So that ſtill it appears, <hi>Juſtin M.</hi> by both theſe phraſes intended to expreſs the fervency of him that officiated, not his uſing new and various words.</p>

As to the Examiner, he would make that ſenſe neceſſary by a Caſe which he refers to me to decide, <hi>viz. Whether a Miniſter uſing a preſcribed Form with all the fervency he can, may be ſaid to pray as well as he is able, if he think he can repreſent his Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments better by his own Expreſſions?</hi> Which Caſe I thus reſolve; If the Form he uſe be our Liturgy, and he goes on ſtill to uſe it, notwithſtanding the ſpirit of Pride ſuggeſts to him great things of his own abilities, He prays better than he is able to do on the ſudden, in his own Expreſſions: And I cannot believe any conſidering man of tolerable modeſty, will ſay, that he is able to expreſs the wants of a public Congregation better (eſpecially without ſtudy) than they are expreſſed in our acurate Forms, drawn up by ſo many learned and pious Men, with great care and judgment, wherein all ordinary caſes are provided for, and to which (when public Affairs require it) New occaſional Forms are added in better Expreſſions, than moſt of us can put together by ſtudy and our utmoſt care: He therefore who prays fervently by ſuch Forms, certainly prays as well as he is able.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, He adviſeth me, <hi>to look over my Quotations again, and ſee whether they mean no more than vigorous affections:</hi> Which is a fine way of covering his ill ſucceſs in examining them. He never
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:93476:19"/>
ſlips any advantage; and from his ſilence I may conclude, he found none here; wherefore my proofs for this Senſe ſtand good, till he offer ſomething to invalidate them.</p>

                     </gap> relates only to the Affections, is, becauſe it is frequently applied to praiſes, which I have proved, generally were in Forms. And I juſtly taxed Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> for applying the phraſe only to Prayers, ſince in this and another place of <hi>Justin,</hi> it <hi>chiefly, if not only relates to the Hymns, &amp;c.</hi> Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> falſly cites my words, as if I ſaid, <hi>It only related to the Hymns, &amp;c.</hi> whereas I do think it relates to <hi>Prayers,</hi> but not only nor chiefly to them; becauſe in the former place of <hi>Juſtin M. p.</hi> 60. it is joyned to <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, being ſo often applied to Praiſes, and chiefly relating to them, in theſe two places of <hi>Juſtin M.</hi> and they being for the moſt part in preſcribed Forms, it muſt ſignifie ſomething which is proper to thoſe who praiſe God by a Form, that is (not making new Expreſſions, but) <hi>fervency:</hi> But if he will have it in <hi>Juſtin M.</hi> equally relate to Prayers, it is certain the Prayers and Praiſes were both alike, for he ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">

Now the Hymns at the Euchariſt were one ſort of praiſes, inſtituted by Chriſt, and ſurely not omitted by this pure Age, ſo near their firſt appointment; and theſe muſt be Forms; yet theſe among other Praiſes were offered up (<gap reason="foreign">

He objects, <hi>There are other ways of praiſing God beſides Hymns:</hi> I grant it; but ſtill the Hymns, which were not invented by the Preſident, were offered up <hi>according to his ability,</hi> that is, <hi>as fervently as he was able.</hi> I grant alſo, there was a large Thankſgiving uſed at the Euchariſt, but this was reduced to a written Form, when the Apoſtolical Conſtitutions were writ; and the Form was ſo old then, that it was pretended to be made by the Apoſtles, and ſo might be a Form in <hi>Juſtin</hi>'s time. As to his Objection, <hi>That</hi> Juſtin <hi>ſpeaks of no audible concurrence of the people in theſe Offices, but only by ſaying, Amen.</hi> I reply, Suppoſe he did not, yet a Negative Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

from the ſilence of one Author, is like an induction of one particular, it proves nothing; ſince other Writers of this Age do teſtifie, that the Praiſes were made by Forms: And yet I have ſhewed from the former place of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> pag. 60. (in my 35th page) <hi>That the whole Congregation of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian people did praiſe God in their Oblations</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </p>

                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 24. And this leads me to my next Argument, why this Phraſe muſt not be interpreted of <hi>new Expreſſions,</hi> but <hi>Fervency:</hi> becauſe in the parallel place of <hi>Juſtin,</hi> in <hi>Eccleſiasticus</hi> xliii. 30. in two places of <hi>Origen,</hi> and one of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

Mr. <hi>S.

As for Mr. <hi>Cl</hi>'s numerous Quotations I anſwered all that related to Prayers and Praiſes in public; but did not think fit to trouble the Reader or my ſelf, to anſwer his Inſtances, where this or a like Phraſe was applied to other Subjects, ſuch as Writing, Preaching, or private Devotion, as thoſe of S. <hi>Chryſostom,</hi> p. 119. and S. <hi>Baſil,</hi> p. 120. And I think it not very modeſt in him (who hath ſcarce anſwered one of my collateral proofs) to triumph

But he knows I brought it not to prove a whole Liturgy, but limited it for a proof of one Hymn; and therefore he is unjuſt, to put in more into the Concluſion than I did, and from thence to invalidate my Argument. Upon which occaſion I would ask three Queſtions: Firſt, Whether he or Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> have brought ſo expreſs a proof as this, that any ſingle part of the Service was Extempore? Secondly, Whether the proof of any one Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Form, known and uſed ſo early (as this which is mentioned alſo in <hi>Clem. ep. ad Cor. pag. 98, &amp;</hi> 104.) doth not prove it ancient and lawful to uſe preſcribed Words in public Worſhip? Thirdly, What reaſon can be given, why other parts of the Service might not be in Form, as well as this? But ſtill Mr. <hi>S. B. cannot appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how this proves the</hi> Gloria Patri, <hi>unleſs no Doxology but that can end with theſe words.</hi> His Apprehenſion would have been quicker, if this had been a ſeeming proof of Mr. <hi>Cl</hi>'s ſide; but let it be conſidered by unbiaſſed perſons, That if theſe words be the concluſion of any other Form, it ſerves my purpoſe as well, as if they concluded the <hi>Gloria Patri:</hi> And it is evident they were the certain and conſtant Concluſion of ſome Form, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Hereticks urge them, and the Orthodox own them as uſually ſaid <hi>in their Eucharist.</hi> They could not have charged, nor would theſe have confeſſed an uncertain arbitrary phraſe; nor could <hi>Clemens, Irenaeus,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian</hi> have agreed in it, if ſome of them ſometimes only had uſed it? And ſince we can prove, the <hi>Gloria Patri</hi> to be an Hymn as early as this Age, and <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi> notes, that theſe words, <hi>World without end,</hi> were then (as they alſo are now) repeated by the People; I hope it is probable
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:93476:21"/>
at leaſt, that this was a part of the <hi>Gloria Patri.</hi> To conclude, This way of Arguing is further from an imitation of the Hereticks in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> (as he ſuggeſts) than his pretending my Evidence for one Form was intended to prove a whole Liturgy is from mean Sophiſtry.</p>

When <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Chriſtians prayed as having one common Voice, and one mind;</hi> Strom. 7. he plainly alludes to that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> xv. 6. of <hi>Glorifying God with one mind and one mouth:</hi> Wherefore I expounded <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> doth the Apoſtle, That <hi>One common Voice,</hi> inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, <hi>their joyning Voices in reſponſory Forms;</hi> Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> and Mr. <hi>S.

But my account is not only agreeable to Antiquity, where I have proved both by Scripture and Fathers, alternate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſory praiſes and prayers were uſed: But alſo this very Phraſe proves, That the People joyned vocally in the public Worſhip, which could not be without Forms. Thus the <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> Promiſe, to keep Gods Law, is expreſſed <hi>(Exod.</hi> xix. 3.) by their <hi>Saying this all together;</hi> and <hi>Exod.</hi> xxiv. 3. <hi>They anſwered it with one voice.</hi> Baals Prophets did not chooſe one Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to ſpeak for them, when <hi>they all with one mouth prophecied good to</hi> Ahab, 1 <hi>King.</hi> xxii. 35.

Mr. <hi>S.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:93476:22"/>
for Forms, and then he ſhall have leave ſometimes to ſuppoſe it; till then his <hi>[if]</hi> is an evaſion, no anſwer. As to the place I alledged out of <hi>Clemens,</hi> which ſhews the Method of the Chriſtians Prayers, and the main things they pray'd for; He is right as to the Quotation, but miſtaken in ſaying, I applied it to public Prayer; neither I nor <hi>Clemens</hi> limited it either to public or private Prayer: If he pleaſe, I will ſuppoſe this place refers to private Prayers; and then I muſt ask, how <hi>Clemens</hi> could know ſo well, and ſo exactly deſcribe the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and matter of mens private Prayers, if they were not in Forms? and if they uſed Forms in private, 'tis more than probable they uſed them in public alſo. Mr. <hi>S.

B</hi>'s Friends to wink, when they pray Extempore; and if he could prove they looked up to Heaven, while their Eyes were ſhut, that would be a dextrous device indeed.</p>
                  <p>§. 5. <hi>Pag.</hi> 30. <hi>Tertullian</hi> is my next Witneſs; and he firſt, ſpeaking of the Lords Prayer, calls it, <hi>A new Form of Prayer which Chriſt had given his Diſciples;</hi> which Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> did not deny: But the Conformiſt (to ſhew himſelf a greater Enemy to Forms than Mr. <hi>Cl.)</hi> boldly aſſerts, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> means by <hi>Novam formam,</hi> only <hi>A new direction how to perform the Duty of Prayer:</hi> But his manifeſt perverting that Fathers Senſe, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by conſidering, That in this Tract <hi>Tertullian</hi> is expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the very words of Chriſts Form; and immediately after he had deſcribed it by <hi>the new Form he gave to his Diſciples,</hi> he parallels it with, and prefers it before the Form which <hi>John</hi> taught his Scholars: And doth he think, <hi>John</hi>'s was only a Directory? Did not Chriſt and S. <hi>John</hi> both teach their Diſciples a Form? yea, doth not <hi>Tertullian</hi> there obſerve, that the very words of our Saviours Prayer were extant, but <hi>Johns</hi> were not? Nothing can be plainer, than that he means the Lords Prayer by this <hi>New Form,</hi> and that the Chriſtians then uſed it
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:93476:22"/>
as a Form; for he introduces the words to be expounded thus, <hi>We ſay, Our Father, &amp;c. we request, his Name may be hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed</hi>—not ſaying, <hi>let it be hallowed in us</hi> (they varied not a word): Then he alſo ſaith, <hi>We add, Let thy Will be done, &amp;c.</hi> And after his Comment is finiſhed, which ſo fully declares they uſed thoſe very words, he is as clear, that they joyned it to their other Prayers; for he obſerves, <hi>Chriſt allows us to ask other things, after he had premiſed the legal and ordinary Prayer as a foundation:</hi> This is the Lords Prayer, which Chriſts Law enjoyns, and Chriſtians ordinarily or daily uſed, making that the Foundation on which they built up their other Requeſts in their Liturgies, and it is moſt likely the Superſtructure was ſuitable to the Foundation, that is, a Form at leaſt. I confeſs, <hi>Tertullian</hi> doth by way of Preface, before he expounds the Form, and as a concluſion after it, touch upon ſome Paſſages in <hi>Math.</hi> VI concerning the manner of uſing this Form; but the <hi>new Form,</hi> the legitimate and ordinary Prayer, which they ſaid daily, ſignifie the Lords Prayer it ſelf; and ſo may thoſe phraſes alſo, <hi>viz. Orandi diſciplina, &amp; ordinata religio Orationis;</hi> yet if he will expound them of the Directions about Prayer, it will not hurt my Cauſe, ſince there is ſufficient evidence, that the Lords Prayer was called a Form, and uſed as ſuch in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s time.</p>

No man can properly ſay, the two Armies of <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtins</hi> joyned battel, when they ſtood looking on their Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Goliah</hi> though they joyned in heart with them, and each party wiſhed ſucceſs to their own Friend: And when <hi>Tertullian</hi> deſcribes the Chriſtians going in a Body to their Perſecutors, and every one of them declaring he would die for his Religion, they are ſaid to go, <hi>quaſi manu factâ; ad Scap. cap. ult.</hi> Wherefore this phraſe imports vocal joyning in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.

Litany, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> appeals to the Petitions uſually made for the Emperors ſafety, and the good of the State, to prove the Chriſtians Loyalty: For various and arbitrary Expreſſions, daily differing, are no good evidence: And though <hi>Tertullian</hi> writing to Infidels, might not uſe the very words, yet he comes ſo near the Petitions on the like occaſion, found in ancient Liturgies (one of which was ſo old, <hi>An. 360.

I thought I had ſufficiently anſwered him, by proving that the Latins uſed, <hi>Solennes preces,</hi> for <hi>inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable Forms,</hi> as <hi>Briſſonius</hi> tells us, whoſe learned Commentary of the Romans ſolemn Forms, declare he was a very fit Judge of the import of this word. Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> gives no reply to this, but falſly aſſerts; <hi>That I ſaid not one word to Mr.</hi> Cl'<hi>s vindication of this place;</hi> whereas I ſaid more to it <hi>pag.</hi> 44. than he can anſwer; yet I ſhall now add, that <hi>though Scripture was read, Pſalms ſung, Sermons made, and Petitions delegated, in the Aſſembly where the Chriſtians met,</hi> yet the Virgin ſpoke of in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> only took the matter of her Viſions from thence; but her Raptures were after theſe were done, <hi>inter Dominica ſolennia, At the Feaſt of our Lord,</hi> the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> the laſt of all the public Offices, after which always followed, <hi>the diſmiſſion of the People,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> here tells us, <hi>Tranſacta ſolennia dimiſsâ plebe:</hi> So that Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> is miſtaken in applying <hi>Dominica ſolennia</hi> to the <hi>Reading, Singing, and other Offices which went before:</hi> For theſe words only denote the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> as they do alſo in S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who uſeth <hi>Solennibus adimpletis,</hi> for the <hi>Solemn prayer of Conſecration.</hi> And I muſt note further, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> often uſeth <hi>Solennia,</hi> for <hi>Feſtivals of all ſorts; Pagan, Apol. c. 35. ad ux. l. 2. c. 6. Jewiſh, ad ux. cap. 4. &amp; Chriſtian, de Idol. cap.</hi> 14. and ſo it is properly enough applied to the great Chriſtian Feaſt of the Lords Supper: But the reaſon why <hi>Solennia</hi> is uſed for <hi>Festivals;</hi> ſeems to be, becauſe the time and ſolemn Rites of them were all preſcribed, and from thence <hi>Solemn prayers,</hi> or <hi>Verſes,</hi> came to ſignifie, <hi>ſtated, fixed,</hi> and <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed

Forms,</hi> according to <hi>Briſſonius:</hi> Wherefore <hi>Solennia,</hi> both in <hi>Tertullian</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> do import the uſe of <hi>ſolemn and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed words in the ſolemn Feaſt of the Lords Supper:</hi> And it is plain from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> they uſed <hi>the Form preſcribed by Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in Baptiſm,</hi> the other Sacrament, as appears by Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> who cites theſe words of <hi>Tertullian, de Bap. cap.</hi> 13. in his <hi>Diſc. of Lit. pag.</hi> 94. to prove the ancients thought, <hi>the Form of Baptizing was preſcribed by Divine Authority;</hi> but Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> outfaces <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> as well as me, and affirms, <hi>that</hi> forma praeſcripta <hi>doth not ſignifie a preſcribed Form, but only the manner in which Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is to be administred.</hi> Let the Reader conſult the place, and he will be amazed to ſee this Father ſo wilfully perverted to ſerve a Turn: For <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſets down the words of the Form, viz. <hi>In the Name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> cites the Goſpel and ſaith, <hi>this Form is preſcribed there.</hi> Yet his Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is not more falſe, than his Inference is diſingenuous: He knows I brought this only to prove, one part of the Liturgy was a Form; yet he bids his Friend try his faculty, if he can draw a concluſion from hence, for the uſe of ſuch a Liturgy as we are diſcourſing of. This is the old <hi>Cramben bis coctam,</hi> the dull Fallacy ſo often uſed before: 'Tis plain, Liturgies conſiſt of divers parts, and ſome of my Proofs ſhew the Prayers, ſome the Praiſes, ſome the Sacramental Adminiſtrations were in Forms; every one of theſe Proofs are fit to be inſerted in a Hiſtory of Liturgy, although the general concluſion doth not ariſe from that ſingle proof, but from an induction of all the particulars: So that if he, or his Friend, will be trying their Faculties, they may do it by ſhewing, <hi>That all my Proofs put together, do not make out a preſcribed Liturgy;</hi> or, <hi>that a proof brought for one part, doth not make out that part was a Form.</hi>

I cannot wonder that he who can deny, that <hi>Forma praeſcripta,</hi> is a <hi>preſcribed Form,</hi> ſhould ſay, that <hi>my Inſtance out of Tert. ad ux. l.</hi> 2. is not to our preſent purpoſe, becauſe it only <hi>concerns Singing:</hi> But are not Pſalms and Hymns which are ſung, one main part of Liturgy? he may as well affirm, that to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Veins and Arteries, is nothing to the purpoſe of an Anatomy-Lecture: The laudatory part was at leaſt one half of the Service, and that being alternate, was certainly in Forms; and the Prayers, will be thought Forms alſo, till he can give
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:93476:24"/>
a good reaſon, why one part of their Offices ſhould be different from the other, or why they might not pray as well as ſing by Forms: But he ſaith, <hi>This paſſage relates to Singing in the Family.</hi> Suppoſe it do, yet if the Husband and Wife ſang alternately, that is, by a Form; it is very likely they did ſing by Forms in public, where ſo many were to joyn in the ſame Pſalm or Hymn, that the words muſt be known before.

                     </gap>, ſo 'tis in the beſt Copies] <hi>de ſpect. p.</hi> 83. Here is a plain compariſon between Words and Actions to be uſed in the Church, and in the Theatre, by perſons who went to both places; they clapped and lifted up the ſame hands, they ſhouted and ſaid <hi>Amen</hi> with the ſame mouth, to very different objects, and on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions that did no way agree. In the Theatre they ſaid, in a ſolemn Form of acclamation, <hi>World without end,</hi> to a mortal, yea, to a wicked man, that is, to <hi>Commodus</hi> the Emperor; (for <hi>Xiphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line</hi> notes, the <hi>Romans</hi> a little before this had uſed thoſe words in a ſolemn Exclamation to <hi>Commodus, Epiſt. Dion. in Com. p.</hi> 383.) But in the Church, theſe very words were in a Form of praiſe to God and Chriſt (as out of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> I noted before) wherefore it would be little leſs than Blaſphemy, to apply the words of a Chriſtian Hymn, proper to an Eternal Being, unto a lewd mortal Man. Thus <hi>Tertullian</hi> argues, and if his Compariſon be truly made, as it was a Form uſed by all the people at the Theatre; ſo it muſt be in ſome Form which the People repeated at Church, that is, probably in the <hi>Gloria Patri,</hi> becauſe it ſtill ſtands in that part of this Hymn which the People ſay; but it ſerves my purpoſe as well (ſince it muſt be a Form ſaid by the People) as if it were the end of any other Hymn. But he wonders <hi>that the</hi> Africans, <hi>who belonged to the Latin Church, ſhould ſay the</hi> Gloria Patri <hi>in Greek:</hi> Whereas it doth not follow from
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:93476:24"/>
                     <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that they ſaid it in Greek; his Argument is as good if they had ſaid it in Latin: Only the Romans uſed many ſolemn Forms in Greek both in their Theatres and their Temples, and <hi>Xiphiline</hi> ſets down this in Greek; ſo that probably <hi>Tertullian</hi> refers to that paſſage in the Hiſtorian, and only means it was uſed in Greek in the Theatre. He might alſo read it in Greek in <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi> and in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> and ſo cite it in Greek; but that will no more prove the <hi>African</hi> Service was in Greek, than that the <hi>Roman</hi> or <hi>Gallican</hi> Churches uſed to ſay it in Greek, in <hi>Clemens</hi> or <hi>Irenaeus</hi> times. Only from this and many other Greek words left uninterpreted in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and other <hi>African</hi> Fathers, we may be ſure the <hi>African</hi> People knew ſome Greek, eſpecially ſhort and common Forms and Phraſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 34. Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> had produced three places of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> to juſtifie the Extempore way; all which I anſwered. For the two firſt, Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> refers the Reader to Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> becauſe I ſaid ſo little concerning them; though I ſaid ſo much indeed, that he is not able to anſwer it; nor clear Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> who is evidently miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in referring, <hi>that Singing,</hi> which was uſed after the Love-feaſt, to the Chriſtians public Devotions. 'Tis known, that they were always faſting till after their Morning ſolemn Service, of which this Singing could be no part, becauſe it was after the Common Meal: Secondly, I ſhewed there is nothing in <hi>Tertullian</hi> which hinders us from believing, that the Hymns made <hi>de proprio inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi> were compoſed at home; and if ſo, then they were Forms, as well as thoſe taken out of Scripture: Thirdly, The uſe of private Compoſures in an Inſpired Age, will not juſtifie the uſe of them now. As to the ſecond place, I proved expreſly out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> that the Chriſtians did often look down in Prayer, and ſo ſhewed Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> was miſtaken, when from their conſtant looking up to Heaven in prayer, he argued they uſed no Books to pray by: Which I think is as full an Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> as can be deſired; And the true Reaſon why Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> doth examine nothing of all this, is, becauſe he could find no evaſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 35. But Mr. <hi>Cl</hi>'s main proof for Extempore Prayer, is, Thirdly, from <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s ſaying, they prayed <hi>de pectore;</hi> which phraſe I ſhewed in four pages, was capable of ſeveral more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Interpretations. Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> replies not to any of theſe Proofs; but diverts his Reader, by telling him what <hi>he conceives and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:93476:25"/>
apprehends to be</hi> Tertullian's <hi>meaning:</hi> Firſt, He reſets to a place of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 8. where though the Apoſtles firſt words, <hi>Lifting up holy hands,</hi> may explain <hi>Manibus expanſis, &amp;c.</hi> yet how, <hi>without wrath and doubting,</hi> ſhould expound <hi>Tertullian's</hi> praying, <hi>Bare-head, and without a Monitor,</hi> I cannot imagine. Secondly, He would explain this place, by another in the ſame Author a few Lines after, which ſpeaks of <hi>a Prayer proceeding from a chaſte Body, an innocent Soal, and from the Holy Spirit:</hi> Yet here again, <hi>a chaſte Body and an innocent Soul,</hi> doth not explain praying with <hi>Lifted-up hands, and a Bare-head;</hi> and none but the worſt of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts will pretend, that <hi>a Prayer out of our own Breaſt,</hi> is the ſame with one <hi>proceeding from the Holy Spirit.</hi> Beſides, if his bad Edition do not miſlead him, he is much to blame in reading and pointing this place;—<hi>majorem hoſtiam, quàm ipſe mandavit, orationem de carne pudicâ, &amp;c.</hi> which makes the ſenſe or non-ſenſe to lie, that the good Chriſtian offers a greater Sacrifice than God hath commanded—But the true reading is, <hi>Ei offero opimam &amp; majorem hoſtiam, quam ipſe mandavit orationem, de carne pudicâ, de animâ innocenti, de Spiritu Sancto profectam,</hi> Apol c. 30. He ſpeaks here of the Lords Prayer, the very ſame Prayer which Chriſt commanded, which was a greater and better Sacrifice than any that the Heathen offered, when it was offered up with <hi>a chaſte Body, a holy Soul, and thoſe devout affections which are excited by the holy Ghoſt.</hi> Now let him try his faculty, how the purity, innocence, and devotion of Chriſtians ſaying the Lords Prayer (a Form, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Chriſt) can prove, that <hi>praying out of the breaſt</hi> (in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Emperors in the former place) ſignifies <hi>Praying extem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pore,</hi> as he and Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> pretend. I will only add to my former Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition (that <hi>the Breaſt</hi> ſignifies <hi>the Memory)</hi> theſe Notes: A Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor is properly to help memory, but the Chriſtians who could ſay their Forms by heart, or out of their breaſt, needed <hi>no Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor,</hi> as the Pagans did in reciting their Forms: So of a perſon fixed in the Memory, <hi>Perſius, Sat.</hi> 5. ſaith—<hi>ſinuoſo in pectore fixi;</hi> And <hi>Socrates</hi> clearly uſes <hi>Tertullian's</hi> Phraſe in this ſenſe, where he ſaith, Theodoſius <hi>could repeat the Holy Scriptures</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

B.</hi> can bring ſo good Evidence, that <hi>de pectore</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>Extempore,</hi> it will then be time enough, to ſay more to that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:93476:25"/>
feigned Expoſition; in the mean while I ſhall conclude, that this Phraſe is no ground for <hi>Extempore Prayer;</hi> no, not in this Second Century, wherein there were miraculous Gifts, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably that of Prayer.</p>

Latin Homilies as good Evidence on his ſide, <hi>Diſc. of Lit. p.</hi> 56, 105, 121, &amp; 140; but when we cite them againſt him, he flies to this poor refuge, of Suppoſing this might be added by the Tranſlators: But it will be always a rule in Equity, <hi>That the Witneſs we produce for us, is good Evidence against us,</hi> and Mr. <hi>S.

Beſides, Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> p. 39. ſaith, <hi>The People uſed frequently to ſay, Lord, give us a part, &amp;c.</hi> Now, I would know, <hi>Whether they prayed Extempore in public?</hi> He formerly affirms they were not called to this; yet here being pinched, he contradicts himſelf, and will have theſe words which the People uſed, to imply no more than what may be done by thoſe who pray Extempore. As for his pretence, That the People ſaid theſe words in the time of the Diſcourſes or Homily, that contradicts <hi>Origen,</hi> who affirms, <hi>It was ſaid in the Prayer</hi>—<hi>therefore not in the Sermon.</hi> Finally, Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> ſaith, <hi>If the matter be well enquired into,</hi> Origen's <hi>Explication is a reproof of the Prayer it ſelf, and it may be queſtioned, whether we may pray for what he ſaith thoſe Petitions import.</hi> And why did not the Examiner <hi>ex officio</hi> enquire well into it, eſpecially ſince I had proved the Prayer was Orthodox? Again, If <hi>Origen</hi> reprove the Prayer it ſelf, then it was a Prayer in <hi>Origen's</hi> time, and not added by his Tranſlators: But if Mr. <hi>S.

I perceive he fancies, <hi>the Devil is more afraid of an Extempore Prayer, than a Form:</hi> But he forgets that Chriſt put, <hi>Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil,</hi> into his Form, to ſecure us againſt the Devil and his Inſtruments. The Devil hath often been afraid of our Lords Form; but that he dreads not an Extempore Prayer, appears from Conjurers and Witches, who actually dealt with the Devil, and yet were admired for this kind of praying <hi>(Hist.

Finally, He that is ſo unhappy in expounding <hi>Origen</hi>'s Writings, is very unfit to tell us <hi>what he thought;</hi> he himſelf admires Extempore Prayer, and thence concludes, <hi>Origen</hi> doted on it alſo; but the Centuriaters (who knew <hi>Origen</hi>'s Senſe better than he or Mr. <hi>Cl.)</hi> declare expreſly, there were Forms in <hi>Origen</hi>'s time.</p>

Laſtly, The full proof I brought, that Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> was groſly miſtaken in pretending, that <hi>Origen</hi> cited thoſe paſſages out of the Pſalter, which he brings in with this Preface, <hi>We find—we ſay—in the Prayer</hi> (as he did the Collect, <hi>pag.</hi> 37.) would have ſilenced any man but Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> who takes no notice, that I proved <hi>Origen</hi> cited many other paſſages out of the Pſalms directly, without this Preface; that theſe were Sentences proper for Liturgies; and that the Offices at <hi>Alexandria</hi> (well known to <hi>Origen)</hi> were taken chiefly out of the Pſalms: And though he can make no reply to this Evidence, that he may not ſeem wholly ſilent, he Firſt flies to his old ſhift, and calls for <hi>an ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent proof of Liturgies.</hi> Now, had I brought none before, the citing whole Sentences as known and certain parts of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy commonly uſed, is a good proof if it were the firſt: But I have brought divers before, which want nothing to make them authentic, but his allowance, which he reſolves never to grant, and then hopes he is ſafe. Secondly, When he had ſtated the caſe wrong, and kept all that makes for me, ſecret; he appeals to his partial and miſinformed Friend: But if that Friend will conſider, that <hi>Origen</hi> doth cite many paſſages out of the Pſalter, and other places (which are alſo in the <hi>Pſalter)</hi> expreſly <hi>out of the Prayer,</hi> and refers to known words <hi>ſaid and uſed in Prayer;</hi> he ſhall then have liberty to judge, whether there were not divers Forms taken out of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and uſed in the Prayers, to which <hi>Origen</hi> doth refer in plain words. There is another clear confutation of Mr. <hi>Cl</hi>'s Expoſition of <hi>Origen</hi>'s Homily on <hi>Numb.</hi> xi. and a further confirmation of my Opinion, that <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>§. 3. <hi>pag. 41, &amp;c.</hi> That there were Forms of Prayer uſed in S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, I inferred firſt from his allowing the uſe of the Lords Prayer as a Form, and his owning the repeating of the very words of it. The Examiner firſt ſaith, <hi>If this be ſuppoſed, it will not amount to a proof of Liturgies in our Senſe.</hi> I anſwer, If he grant this, it proves praying by a Form lawful and ancient, inſtituted by Chriſt, and continued to be uſed in public; yea, repeated by the People among the primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; it proves one main part of the public Service was an
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:93476:28"/>
invariable Form, and ſuch a part as was to be the pattern of all other prayers, which muſt be Forms alſo, if they exactly imitated this Divine Exemplar; the proſpect of which Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences make <hi>Mr. S. B.</hi> fly off again from his conceſſion, and labour for two whole pages to prove, that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth not <hi>intimate the uſe of thoſe words,</hi> but only, <hi>our following the directions which Christ had given for the manner of performing the duty of Prayer.</hi> But the bare reading the Father, not only confutes, but expoſes this poor Evaſion: He is about to explain this Form, and firſt ſaith, <hi>Chriſt gave us a Form of Prayer</hi>—and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains himſelf preſently thus—<hi>ut dum prece &amp; oratione quam filius docuit apud patrem Loquimur, faciliùs audiamur.</hi> Where we ſee the Form, is thoſe very words which Chriſt taught, and which we ſpeak to his Father; and Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> fallaciouſly leaves out <hi>[loquimur]</hi> the main word in the Sentence, importing our repeating the very words, on purpoſe to impoſe upon his Reader—S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> adds—<hi>This is the moſt ſpiritual and true Prayer, which was pronounced by his mouth—for when Christs Prayer aſcends to Gods ears, the Father will own the Sons words</hi>—He ſaith alſo, <hi>When we ask forgiveneſs we pronounce the words of our Advocate, and not only ask in his Name, but by his own Prayer.</hi> Can any man now doubt that <hi>Forma orandi,</hi> here ſignifies the words of our Lords Prayer? or deny <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s commending the uſe of that Form? Let us apply the aforeſaid paſſages to his Notion <hi>of Directions and Inſtructions,</hi> and ſee how ridiculous it will appear; <hi>Do we ſpeak or ſay over Chriſt's dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions about the manner of praying to the Father, that we may be heard more eaſily?</hi> are thoſe Inſtructions, <hi>that ſpiritual and true Prayer pronounced by Chriſt's mouth?</hi> are they Chriſt's prayer which <hi>aſcends to his Fathers ears, and are owned by him as his Sons words when we pray?</hi> is our following his Inſtructions <hi>asking forgiveneſs in his own words, and by his own Prayer?</hi> Alas! to what abſurdities hath his Reſolution, to defend an ill cauſe, reduced him! 'Tis true, S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> digreſſeth a little (as <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> had done) to explain the directions which our Lord gave about the manner of praying; but he ſoon returns to the Form it ſelf, repeating it <hi>verbatim;</hi> and as he explains every ſingle Petition, affirming, that <hi>the Chriſtians ſaid ſo and ſo in their Prayers.</hi> And it is clear from him, that they both uſed
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:93476:28"/>
this Prayer, and others formed by this pattern; wherefore <hi>alitèr orare, praying otherwiſe</hi> (in S. <hi>Cyprian)</hi> which he ſo ſeverely cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, cannot be deſigned to condemn thoſe Churches who framed other Forms by this pattern, and always uſed this Form for one, as our Church hath done; it is levelled at thoſe who either wholly omit the Lords Prayer, or in their arbitrary Compoſures take no care to ſuit them to this Heavenly pattern, of both which ſome Diſſenters are guilty: He concludes with obſerving, that I noted <hi>Origen</hi>'s phraſe of <hi>uſing Prayers,</hi> imported, they were compoſed by others; and he wonders what I would note upon <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s phraſe of <hi>making Prayers:</hi> And I have a Note upon that which will not pleaſe him, <hi>viz.</hi> That S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, a Man makes his Prayer, when he uſes the very words of the Lords Prayer, the Form of Chriſt's making: And if Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> would infer from hence, That they prayed extempore or arbitrarily, he cannot draw that concluſion from S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> where he that prays by a Form, is ſaid <hi>precem facere,</hi> to <hi>make a Prayer:</hi> So that <hi>uſing Prayers</hi> in <hi>Origen,</hi> plainly ſuppoſes them made. before-hand; but <hi>making Prayers,</hi> here, do not at all ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to be Extempore, nor can they infer that from the words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> who would <hi>have prayers, &amp;c. to be made for all men, 1 Tim.</hi> ii. 1.</p>

I brought that paſſage in S. <hi>Cyprian, Publica eſt nobis, &amp; communis oratio,</hi> to prove, that the Congregation vocally joyned with the Prieſt in prayers, which doth ſuppoſe a Set Form. Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Common-prayer</hi> ſignifies no more, than that <hi>we muſt pray for all People.</hi> Now S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> indeed doth make this one ſenſe of <hi>Common-prayer,</hi> as appears by the words he cites; but then the Father goes on to ſhew, that the Lords Prayer (for it is of that he ſpeaks) is a Common prayer, becauſe it is ſaid, as that of the Three Children was, <hi>Who</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>all agreed in their prayer, in voices as well as in hearts, and ſung their Hymn as it were with one mouth</hi>—(note here the meaning of that phraſe) <hi>And ſo</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>did the Apoſtles, who are ſaid to pray with one accord.</hi> Thus far S. <hi>Cyprian.</hi> Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> wholly omits this ſenſe of a Common-prayer, and which is worſe, denies that this is any meaning of it: But let it be conſidered, that the people then vocally repeated the Lords Prayer (the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer here ſpoken of) and let it be remembred what I

                     </gap>, upon pag. 20. and then I hope it will be granted this is one ſenſe of a <hi>Common-prayer,</hi> that is, <hi>a Form in which Prieſt and People may vocally joyn.</hi> Yea, this ſeems the only ſenſe in the ſecond Quotation which I cited, <hi>Cypr. ad Cler. &amp; Pleb. ep. 8. We muſt pray for all—as the Lord taught there where he enjoyned, not every one a ſingle Prayer, but commanded us to pray for all men with a Common-prayer in which all agree.</hi> For here S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lords Prayer was a Prayer for all Men;</hi> and then adds, <hi>it was a Common-prayer.</hi> Now this would be a tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, If the only ſenſe of <hi>a Common-prayer,</hi> were <hi>a Prayer for all Men;</hi> this had been as if he had ſaid, We muſt pray for all men, in a Prayer for all men; if that were all, S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> might have left out <hi>Orare pro omnibus,</hi> or <hi>communi prece;</hi> but his uſing both theſe phraſes ſhews not only, that the ſubject of the Lords Prayer was general for all men; but the way of uſing it, was by the peoples joyning with the Prieſt, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing it in common. And if S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> believed Chriſt taught us to pray thus by vocal joyning in one common Form, then they who will have the Miniſter alone make all the prayers Extempore, while the people ſilently ſit by and hear, teach another manner of praying than Chriſt taught.</p>

I ſtill take to be a firm proof of the uſe of alternate Forms in the public Service, and think it probable, he cited them out of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy: A Verſicle and Reſponſe is an alternate Form, and S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> mentions it, as a thing known and daily uſed in public. The Centuriators infer hence, <hi>That there were Forms in his time;</hi> and <hi>Goulartius</hi> (a learned Proteſtant) in his Notes on the place, <hi>Owns it was a Form uſed of old at the Euchariſt, where it continued to be uſed in</hi> S.

It were happy for Arts, if none but Artiſts might judge of them.</hi> However, his Reflections could not have hurt me in ſo good Company; if he had vented them, they muſt have returned
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:93476:29"/>
on his own head, for he that deſpiſes ſuch Evidence, brings both his learning and modeſty into queſtion. Again, he retires to his old Fallacy, <hi>That I ſhould firſt have proved there was then a Liturgy, before I had ſuppoſed this paſſage was cited out of it.</hi> I hope I have proved this to every body but Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> who will not allow any proof to be the firſt, and by that politick Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, hopes to perſuade ſuch as take his word, there can be no ſecond proof; but whatever become of my former Evidence in his Opinion, I am ſure there was one in this place which he could not anſwer, <hi>viz. That this very Preface in ſo many words, is found in all Liturgies of the African, Eaſtern, and Western Churches.</hi> To which I add now, that S. <hi>Aug.</hi> ſaith, <hi>All Mankind as with one voice uſed theſe words; de ver. Rel. c.</hi> 3. And the Liturgies wherein theſe words are preſcribed, muſt be elder than S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time; for S. <hi>Aug.</hi> believed this Form came from the Apoſtolical Age. S. <hi>Cyril</hi> (who explained this Form in S. <hi>James</hi>'s Liturgy, not above 70 year (according to S. <hi>Hierom)</hi> after <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time) tells us ſo early, that he had this and other myſtical Forms, from the Tradition of his Fathers. The Author of the Conſtitutions (who writ, as I have ſhewed in the middle of the next Century) hath alſo this Preface in the Euchariſtical Office, which was ſo old then, that it challenged an Apoſtolical Original. And ſince the Form was ſo ancient, and not only in theſe Churches, but in thoſe which followed the Liturgies of S. <hi>Baſil</hi> and S. <hi>Chryſoſtom;</hi> and in the Weſt, the ſame words were uſed, it is evident the Form muſt be ſo very old, that none preſumed to alter it: Let Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> (before he deſpiſe this Evidence) give an inſtance of ſome Extempore or arbitrary Prayer or Exhortation, wherein ſo many diſtant Churches did ſo univerſally, or could ſo exactly agree; till then his Harangues about a poſſibility of exhorting or praying in various words, is nothing to the purpoſe: Nor is his Objection material, <hi>that</hi> Cyprian <hi>doth not ſpeak of it as being uſed in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt:</hi> For he ſpeaks of it; as uſed ſo oft as the Prieſt and people met at ſolemn Prayer, that is, daily; and he ſaith, §. 13. that they then received the Euchariſt every day; wherefore this Preface was uſed daily in the Euchariſt, where all the Liturgies, and where all the Fathers, <hi>Cyril, Ambroſe, Auguſtin, Chryſoſtom, &amp;c.</hi> expreſly ſay it was uſed; yea, S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> reckons it up as one eminent part of the Liturgy, <hi>in Coloſſ. hom. 3. Tom. 4. pag.</hi> 106.

So that this Preface (which alſo gives name to the Lauds that follow it) was a part of the Communion Office in Form, as early at leaſt as S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s time, and we have proved the Lords Prayer was ſo alſo, which is a good ſtep toward a preſcribed Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, both theſe being always and invariably uſed.</p>

Again, I did not pretend to find a Chriſtian Litany in the ſame Tract, but the general heads of one, the words of which (as I noted) they concealed from Pagans; but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance between <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s and <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s heads, and thoſe in the Litanies, whoſe Original is ſo ancient, we cannot poſitively aſſign it: This (I ſay) is at leaſt <hi>a probable proof they were then in Litanick Forms,</hi> eſpecially if with S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> we believe theſe Forms were made at firſt by Inſpired perſons, preſerved by ſome and imitated by following Ages, with no more variation than muſt be occaſioned by the difference of time and diſtance of places. I grant, this is but probable Evidence; but in theſe early times we muſt be content with ſuch; and though Mr. <hi>S. B. can ſee no ſtrength in this way of arguing for Liturgies,</hi> yet he diſcerns a mighty ſtrength in Mr. <hi>Cl</hi>'s moſt remote Conjectures for <hi>extempore Prayer.</hi> So he doth in that of <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Epiſtle to P. <hi>Lucius,</hi> wherein
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:93476:30"/>
there is an account, that they at <hi>Carthage</hi> prayed for Pope <hi>Lucius</hi> in his baniſhment, and this <hi>in their Prayers and Sacrifices;</hi> whence Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> infers, <hi>they were at liberty to put up-any occaſional Petition in the Euchariſt, and ſo could not be confined to a ſet Form.</hi> The weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of which Inference I ſhewed, by obſerving, 1ſt, That theſe are not the Petitions put up for us by <hi>Lucius,</hi> but the general purport of them deſcribed in a Letter. 2ly, That a conſtant liberty for inferior Miniſters in this Age when Inſpiration is ceaſed (which is that Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> would have) can by no means fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from the Chief Primate of <hi>Africa</hi>'s making a new Petition or two, in the times while Inſpiration continued. 3dly, Nor a daily liberty in ordinary caſes, be inferred from ſome variety on ſo extraordinary occaſion, as the exile of the chief Patriarch of the Weſt: For if one of the moſt eminent Biſhops at Liberty in the late Reign, had put up one or two new Petitions for his Seven Brethren in the Tower, none could infer from thence, that all our Clergy were always at liberty to pray in what words they pleafed. As to Mr. <hi>Cl</hi>'s Note, That if this had been the <hi>African.</hi> Form for Confeſſors, <hi>Cyprian</hi> need not have told <hi>Lucius</hi> of it: I replied, The diſtance between <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Africa</hi> was ſo great, that <hi>Lucius</hi> might probably be ignorant of that Churches Forms; but however this Letter is rather to acquaint <hi>Lucius</hi> they did pray for him, than to give him an account of the very words. Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> ſaith very little to all this; but with reſpect to my 2d Anſwer, he ſcoffingly reflects upon my ſuppoſing, a Primate had more liberty than an inferior Clergy-man, as if this liberty were to be exerciſed only by ſuch as <hi>could climb up to the top of Eccleſiaſtical Dignity, and not in proportion to mens Gift.</hi> To which I ſhall only ſay, That though there be ſome ſuch as Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> who have extraordinary Abilities, and are not advanced (according to their merit) to be Governors of the Church; the public Peace requires theſe Perſons to forbear exerciſing theſe Abilities, unleſs their Superiors command them; for even in the very Apoſtles Age God himſelf ordered <hi>the ſpirit of the Prophets, to be ſubject to the Prophets,</hi> to prevent confuſion in the Churches of the Saints, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiv. 32, 33. The like proof for Extempore Prayer, is that our of <hi>Cypr. epiſt. ad Moſ. &amp; Max.</hi> which is only the general account <hi>Cyprian</hi> gives theſe Confeſſors in a Letter of prayers made for them; but there is no intimation the Petitions
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:93476:31"/>
were Extempore: So that they muſt either refer to the common Form for Confeſſors, or ſome Form made by this great Primate on this great occaſion; but a daily liberty for the inferior Prieſts to vary then, doth not follow from this place; and if all the Prieſts in <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Dioceſs had made their own Forms for <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Maximus,</hi> or had daily prayed for them in various phraſes, it had been impoſſible for <hi>Cyprian</hi> to pretend to ſet down in a Letter, what was the ſubſtance of thoſe many various prayers: So that whether it were the old Form, or a new one (ſuch as our Biſhops make and ſend us on extraordinary occaſions) it was a Form, and that ſufficiently confutes Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> and ſecures the point in queſtion. Indeed Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> had not cited this place at large in his <hi>Diſc. of Lit. pag.</hi> 68. and I thought he had referred to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that Epiſtle, where S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> deſires the prayers of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Maximus;</hi> but Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> hath obliged me by citing the true place at large, by which I perceive I was miſtaken before; and I ſhall freely own it, wiſhing he may follow my Example ſo oft as I convince him he was in an Error, and then our Controverſie will ſoon be at end; and he may ſee by this Reply now, that it was more difficult for me to find Mr. <hi>Cl</hi>'s Quotation than to anſwer it.</p>

prove an uſage of the Church? 2ly, Whether they might not as well prove the antiquity and lawfulneſs of Extempore Prayers, from the notions and practice of <hi>Montanus</hi> and the <hi>Meſſalians?</hi> 3ly, Whether they believe the preſent Church is obliged now to follow their Examples, who were <hi>out of the ancient Church, and Enemies to it?</hi> When Mr. <hi>S.

Now if they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded nothing in any of theſe particulars to the Adminiſtrations he left them, doubtleſs they made no new Extempore Prayers, nor varied at any time; therefore they confined themſelves inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riably to what he had preſcribed them, in Ceremonies, Words, and myſtical Forms; and theſe words of S. <hi>Baſil</hi> evidently ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he left them a Liturgy conſiſting of all theſe particulars preſcribed.

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:93476:32"/>
the words of which, as well as the method, had never been altered ſince <hi>Gregory</hi>'s time, otherwiſe he could never have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved three words by appealing to this way of Adminiſtration which <hi>Gregory</hi> left them. It was alſo a part of public Worſhip, he would prove Orthodox, <hi>viz. a Doxology;</hi> and S. <hi>Baſil</hi> ſaith, <hi>Gregory and he had the ſame manner of Doxology, as any man who would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, might eaſily be ſatisfied out of the Traditions kept in that Church. Baſide Sp. Sanct. cap. 29. p.</hi> 221. So that, in that Church there were ſome known Traditions, which preſerved the very Form and words of <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Doxology, to which he appeals; and no doubt theſe Traditions were written Records, becauſe they might ſo eaſily be found upon ſearch, and 'tis probable he means they were preſerved in their Liturgy: And 'tis certain, he could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have appealed thus, if at <hi>Naecaeſarea,</hi> they had only kept <hi>Gregory</hi>'s method in their Adminiſtration, but varied the words every day. Mr. <hi>S. B</hi>'s laſt refuge, is to make S. <hi>Baſil</hi> contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in another place of his Works, where he ſaith, <hi>He gives a very different account of theſe</hi> Naeocaeſareans <hi>(viz.</hi> in his 63. Ep.) for when they objected the difference between his way of Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and <hi>Gregories,</hi> he asks them, <hi>By what teſtimonies they will make this difference evident, ſince they had preſerved nothing of</hi> Gregory'<hi>s until that time.</hi> But firſt, It will not eaſily be believed that Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> expounds S. <hi>Baſil</hi> aright, when he makes one place of his Works directly contradict another; Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> will ſooner be ſuſpected of a miſrepreſentation, than this excellent Father of a contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. And 2dly, Theſe two places may fairly be reconciled: The former Quotation <hi>[lib. de Sp. Sanct.</hi> refers to a whole Liturgy; the latter <hi>[Ep.</hi> 63.] relates only the different manner of Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which conſiſting chiefly in ſounds, could not properly be ſet down in any Rubric, but muſt be conveyed by conſtant and invariable practice down from <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Age; their Rubric might direct the uſe of the Pſalms, but not the particular manner of ſinging them. If they alledge, <hi>They ſung them now exactly, as their Forefathers did in</hi> Gregory'<hi>s time;</hi> he asks, <hi>How they can prove a practical thing (wherein their Rubric was ſilent) to be the ſame it was ſo many years before?</hi> Doubtleſs no way, but by making it appear they had varied from <hi>Gregory</hi>'s practice in nothing; and here S. <hi>Baſil</hi> takes occaſion to mind them (who were ſo zealous for their way of ſinging) in how much greater matters of Piety and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:93476:33"/>
they had varied from <hi>Gregory</hi>'s practice: For he uſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent geſtures in prayer; he would not Swear, nor call his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Fool, &amp;c. and theſe are things enjoyned by Holy Scripture: And while nothing of <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Manners (in theſe conſiderable Inſtances) was to be found among them, it was unreaſonable in them to contend with him for a mode of ſinging (not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it ſeems in <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Liturgy, and ſo) only to be proved by their fancy, that it was in uſe in <hi>Gregory</hi>'s days. So that by this Rhetorical phraſe, that <hi>nothing of</hi> Gregory'<hi>s was preſerved,</hi> S. <hi>Baſil</hi> did not mean, <hi>nothing of his Doctrin,</hi> nor <hi>of his Liturgy;</hi> but of his <hi>Uſages</hi> and <hi>Manners</hi> in the greateſt and beſt things, <hi>viz.</hi> his <hi>Practices,</hi> grounded on Holy Scripture; and ſince the <hi>Manner of Singing</hi> was a practice alſo, their failing in greater matters made it very ſuſpicious, they had varied in that which was leſs. As for Mr. <hi>S. B</hi>'s Objection, That S. <hi>Baſil</hi> cites not <hi>Gregory</hi>'s Rubric or Liturgy, but Scripture for theſe Obſervances; it is eaſily anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe thoſe acts of Piety and Morality are not the proper Subject for a Rubric, but are expreſly enjoyned in Gods Word; and that makes his Argument the ſtronger, and their tenaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the more unreaſonable. For S. <hi>Baſil</hi> at moſt differed from S. <hi>Gregory</hi> but in a ſuppoſed rite or mode of Singing; but they differed from that holy Biſhop in material duties, poſitively re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by Holy Scripture; and till they corrected theſe Variati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their practices, it was very undecent for them to quarrel at him for a ſlighter difference. And now I hope I have reſcued this holy Father from the pretended contradiction, and ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently proved there was a Liturgy left by <hi>Gregory,</hi> and invariably uſed till S. <hi>Baſil</hi>'s time.</p>
                  <p>§. 5. <hi>Pag.</hi> 55. From the preſcribed Hymns writ at leaſt as early as the beginning of this Century, and rejected by <hi>Paulus Samoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenus</hi> (mentioned by <hi>Euſeb. lib. 7. cap.</hi> 24.) it is certain they uſed Forms of Praiſe in their public Worſhip, and from parity of Reaſon I argued the probability of their praying by Forms alſo. Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> inſtead of giving a ſolid Reaſon (as he hath often been deſired) why they might not pray to God, as well as praiſe him by Forms: 1ſt, Pretends <hi>he is not ſenſible this way of arguing is cogent.</hi> But I think that Argument to which he can give no ſolid Anſwer, and which puts him into a fit of Railing,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:93476:33"/>
is very cogent: For, 2dly, He rudely falls upon my Character and Qualifications, and expoſes me for <hi>conceiting my Tautologies to be graceful Flights.</hi> I might in return to this enquire into his Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications for that Office he once aſſumed, of going about with the vile Regulators of Corporations, in the laſt Reign, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the choice of ſuch Members as would take away the Penal Laws and Teſt, and level the way for Popery to come in under the mask of Toleration. But I will be content to vindicate my ſelf, and muſt tell him, I have ſo much skill both in Liturgies and Singing, that I know Hymns, Pſalms, and Praiſes are a large and eſſential part of all Liturgies, and ſo mixed with Prayers, that it is impoſſible to ſeparate them; and I am ſo far from knowing any difference between Praying and Singing, that I can ſing a Petition as well as a Thankſgiving; and ſo can Mr. <hi>S. B</hi>'s Friends at their Meetings, where they ſing Pſalms of Prayer as well as Praiſe. The <hi>Lutheran</hi> Proteſtants ſing all their Prayers, ſome of our Anthems alſo are Collects, and we have muſical Notes adapted to the Litany, as well as to the <hi>Te Deum:</hi> We read many of our Praiſes, and ſing ſome of our Prayers. And many of the Diſſenting Paſtors uſe ſuch variety of Tone in their Prayer, that if it did not want regularity it might be called Singing; and if a skilful man heard their inartificial Modula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and odd Cadencies, he would think they did not ſcruple ſinging their Prayers, but choſe to do it with Diſcord rather than Harmony. But ſtill it appears, that Singing is one way of performing the duty of Prayer among all ſorts of Chriſtians, and he can find no more difference between ſinging and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, than between ſinging and ſaying a Prayer; that is one way of praying, and ſinging is another; only we may ſing a Form, according to art, but an Extempore Prayer cannot be ſang har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniouſly.</p>
                  <p>§. 6. <hi>Pag.</hi> 56. My laſt Inſtance in this Period was to ſhew, <hi>That the People uſed the Form of ſaying, Amen, upon receiving the Euchariſt.</hi> Now this matter of Fact is undeniably true: I proved it before out of <hi>Juſtin M.</hi> and <hi>Tertullian;</hi> and here <hi>Euſebius</hi> confirms it by the Epiſtle of <hi>Dionyſius,</hi> B. of <hi>Alexandria</hi> (which ſhould have been figured thus; <hi>Lib. 7. cap. 8. pag.</hi> 188.) and my Examiner makes the ſame thing plain from an Epiſtle of <hi>Cornelius</hi> B. of <hi>Rome,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:93476:34"/>
alſo by <hi>Euſebius:</hi> wherefore, ſince ſo many diſtant Churches did ſo exactly agree in the uſe of this Reſponſe at the very time of Receiving; no doubt it was enjoyned by ſome preſcribed Rule (grounded at firſt upon that of S. <hi>Paul, How ſhall he—ſay Amen, at thy Euchariſt, 1. Cor.</hi> xiv. 16.) For had it been arbitrary, it would have been varied, and neither the ſame word, nor the ſame time of ſaying it, could have been found in different Churches and diſtant Ages: The conſequence of which is, that there were preſcribed Forms directing a certain Reſponſe in one certain part of the Service, for the People. Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> paſſes by this Inference very wiſely, and pretends I went about to prove here, That the Form of Adminiſtring the Sacrament was preſcribed: Now this can be nothing but a wilful miſtake, becauſe I ſaid expreſly, <hi>This was a Form in which all Christians agreed at one certain time and place:</hi> But the Chriſtian People never repeated the words of Adminiſtration: That Form indeed is very ancient, grounded on Scripture, and alluded to by both theſe Authors; but I was not ſpeaking of the Form of Adminiſtration, but of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Cuſtom of ſaying <hi>Amen,</hi> juſt when they received; which clears the uſe of preſcribed Forms.</p>
                  <p>§. 7. <hi>Pag.</hi> 59. I ſhall conclude with a brief review of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, whereby I have made out either the ancient uſe of a Liturgy in general, or of the ſeveral parts of it. 1ſt, <hi>The Prayers delivered from their Fore-fathers,</hi> in <hi>Joſephus;</hi> the word <hi>Liturgy</hi> in <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> and <hi>Hippolitus;</hi> the <hi>One Prayer allowed by the Biſhop,</hi> in <hi>Ignatius;</hi> the <hi>Common-prayers,</hi> in <hi>Juſtin M. The Prayers made as with one common Voice,</hi> in <hi>Cl. Alexandrinus; The ſolemn Rites and praying by Memory,</hi> in <hi>Tertullian;</hi> the Chriſtians uſing <hi>Preſcribed or enjoyned Prayers and Forms taken out of the Pſalms,</hi> in <hi>Origen; The Public and Common-Prayer,</hi> in <hi>Cyprian:</hi> And that Liturgy left by <hi>Gregory Thaumaturgus,</hi> uſed <hi>without adding or altering a word, for an hundred years after;</hi> do prove a Liturgy in general: And, 2dly, for the parts of it, I have proved the <hi>Hymns were preſcribed Forms, ſung alternately,</hi> by <hi>Philo, Pliny, Ignatius,</hi> and ſo very many others, that I am cenſured for Tautology; The <hi>Gloria Patria,</hi> I have ſhewed to be as ancient as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> and <hi>Tertullian;</hi> The <hi>Litany</hi> is plainly alluded to by <hi>Juſtin M. Tertullian,</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian;</hi> There is a Collect in Form clearly proved from <hi>Origen;</hi> The
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:93476:34"/>
                     <hi>Lords Prayer</hi> was repeated by all the People in public, in the time of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who alſo hath <hi>the Preface and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſes uſed at the Euchariſt, in a Form;</hi> the anſwering <hi>Amen</hi> at the Receiving, is a Form in <hi>Juſtin M. Tertullian,</hi> and many others; and S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſhews, they did not vary Chriſts Form of Baptizing. Now theſe Proofs in a dark Age (wherein there were few Writers, and thoſe only accidentally and cautiouſly mention theſe things) are ſufficient to ſhew, that Forms of Prayer and Praiſe are very ancient, choſen as the beſt way of ſerving God in public, even when many did not need them (becauſe divers were Inſpired.) Now if this pure and early Age, had, and uſed Forms invariably, then a ſetled Church after Inſpiration is ceaſed, who imitates their Example, and uſes Forms, becauſe ſhe believes them ancient and lawful; and enjoyns them ſtrictly, becauſe ſhe needs them and finds them expedient; doubtleſs ſhe doth well, and they who can find nothing ſinful in the Forms, but refuſe to Communicate with the Church, meerly becauſe ſhe uſes and enjoyns Forms; theſe not only <hi>were wont to be called Diſſenters,</hi> (as Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> flatters them) but ought now to be called <hi>Diſſenters</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> alſo, being guilty of an inexcuſable Separation.</p>
                  <p>As to his Concluſion, he firſt owns <hi>the Lawfulneſs of Liturgies,</hi> but is afraid, I deſign to make them thought <hi>neceſſary;</hi> and it ſeems that made him labour ſo much to baffle my Proofs of them from <hi>the Three firſt Centuries:</hi> Upon which I muſt aſſure him, that I do not think every thing to be <hi>neceſſary,</hi> which I can prove to have been uſed in the firſt Three Centuries; I think Liturgies ten times more neceſſary now than they were then, and my Proofs in this Period were chiefly deſigned to ſhew the Lawfulneſs and Antiquity of Forms in public Worſhip; but that which makes the uſe of them neceſſary to us, is the Churches Authority: He adds, <hi>Their Lawfulneſs may be argued from more rational Topicks than human Authority; their Expediency muſt be judged upon a juſt weighing of Circumſtances; their Neceſſity cannot be proved by any Topick.</hi> I reply, Mr. <hi>Clarkſon</hi> forced me to argue for Liturgies from human Authority, becauſe he firſt denied them to be Ancient; and I hope, if he argued falſly from that Topic, I might argue truly; eſpecially ſince I urged alſo Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and other Topics in that Hiſtory, which Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> hath not
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:93476:35"/>
anſwered. 2dly, As to their Expediency, the Church (the proper Judge of that) hath already upon weighty Reaſons determined that point; and I ſee no Reaſon why Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> ſhould deſire to have this weighed over again, unleſs he hope to hold the Seales. The Church hath proved their Expediency many and many times, and over and again confuted all the Diſſenters Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and I conſidered this Point, as oft as Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> gave me occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as he will ſee when he hath read my whole Book, For the neceſſity of Liturgies; that follows, from their being expedient, and as ſuch enjoyned by the Church: For an ancient Lawful expedient way of public Worſhip enjoyned by lawful Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, becomes neceſſary: And if there were any Men in the Communion of this Church, who call one another, <hi>Judicious, Learned,</hi> and <hi>Moderate,</hi> and yet are ſo intent upon altering our Foundations, as to count my defending the Eſtabliſhed Way of Worſhip, <hi>The managing a Deſign againſt them,</hi> it would be more neceſſary than ever to keep cloſe to our Ancient Way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. But I hope this is only a Dream of Mr. <hi>S. B</hi>'s, and believe there is really <hi>never a learned, judicious, moderate Man in our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, but himſelf,</hi> who thinks, I had any deſign againſt them in writing my Hiſtory of Liturgies. As for Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> he hath too viſibly declared his averſation to the Eſtabliſhment to make me value his Cenſure; his Friend Mr. <hi>Cl.</hi> could pick up but two Phraſes, which he perverted, (as I ſhewed) and that was all the Grey-Beard he had to faſten to the Juvenile Chin of Extempore praying, (without extraordinary Inſpiration) yet Mr. <hi>S. B.</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mires and defends him. I have brought many Phraſes, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified my expoſition of them, ſo that the durſt not attack them; beſides ſome expreſs proofs: Yet all this is deſpiſed in his ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Concluſion; which is ſo clear a diſcovery of the Man, and the Party he favours, that till he come to examine more cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and judge more indifferently; till he perform more and brag leſs, I will neither trouble the world nor my ſelf with any further Reply to him; being aſſured, that by this looſe way of writing, he will neither do my Cauſe any harm, nor his any good, among thoſe that are truly learned, moderate and judicious, of what Communion ſoever they be.</p>
