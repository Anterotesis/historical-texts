            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:50533:22"/>
that there was ſomewhat in them which was yet hid from us, and that the ancient foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of theſe ſciences had been content to retaine ſomewhat not fully diſcovered. For I found moſt men imployed onely in learning thoſe immenſe hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of Demonſtrations <hi>they</hi> had left us, but ſeldome enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them or going forward, which made me fear that the key of theſe Sciences were hid, and that without ſuch a key, or engine it had been unpoſſible to reare up ſuch a huge ſuper-ſtructure of vaſt conſequences. But this I found two or three great ſpirits had already light on, and had directed a way which if well followed, will make our <hi>Mathematicall</hi> reaſon nimble and apt to finde the fountain head of every <hi>Theoreme,</hi> and by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as we may hope, inable us to the ſolution of any <hi>Probleme</hi> without any more aſſiſtance then pen and inke (ſo that a man may carry all theſe admirable Sciences about him) and direct us to more exact and eaſie inſtruments then any have been yet knowne, and recall mens minds by delicate raviſhing contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, from the ſordid jugling uſe of thoſe inſtruments on which they now ſo perverſly and unanimouſly doat.</p>
            <p>But when I once begun ſeriouſly to view that ſtrange diſpoſition of things which we call Nature; I could not even in my ruder eſtimation of it but be much aſtoniſhed. For it was plaine to me there was more art and prodigious workmanſhip in a Gnat or a Fly then there was in the greateſt engines or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of man; which if they were not caſually found out, were but the meere promotions and purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of Nature. By this I took my ſelf deeply engaged for to looke upon that Fabricke with more curioſity
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:50533:22"/>
and diligence then they commonly uſe, who judge and ſuppute every thing according to the outward tickling and blandiſhments of ſenſe. And as to this deſigne, I thought I was well provided for, by thoſe many volumnes of naturall Philoſophy, which I found to flatter me with a many large and braving Titles. And I thought that when I was once well acquainted with them, I ſhould have had my minde fitted for excellent notions, and embelliſhed with ſuch rich principles, as could not but furniſh me with a many excellent and ſweet deductions. But when I had ſpent ſome time thus; and began to ſhake off that implicite faith which muſt for a while binde up learners, and diſcovered what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, looſe conceptions, and endleſſe controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies thoſe Volumnes were fraught with, I perceived I had gained nothing elſe but a multitude of vaine ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations, which in all reaſon of the world I ought to diſ-beleeve. About this time I happened to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a ſort of books that denounced a ſharpe warre againſt the old Philoſophy, and very ſeverely undertooke to put it all under the ſponge, and withall to raiſe up ſuch other new obſervations as ſhould <hi>prove</hi> more handſomely, and truely make up the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parences and changes of Nature. Theſe men I hugged, and indeed expected from them, ſome performances equall to my expectations; but then againe I found that man may be farre more happy in diſcovering of errours then in finding out of Truths. For ſome of thoſe Treatiſes were meerly draughts and deſignations, others violently wreſted the explaining of things to their owne principles, and rather forced Nature to their conceptions, then enlarged their conceptions as
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:50533:23"/>
wide as Nature. Otherſome there were, who abuſing a Philoſophicall liberty, ſtrayed into ſome anticke Theories, and made Nature monſtrous: Others laid down very probable and neat <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> but abſolutely unſuited to the nature of the thing; ſo that I collected, that though we had made ſome ſteps forwards, yet we were not at our journies end. And becauſe I ſaw that a many curious notions were but like ſpiders webs, and that experiences have the greateſt light, I thought we were principally to inſiſt upon that way. But becauſe moſt experiments were found out rather caſually then by Philoſophicall reaſoning, and ſome men out of one ſmall obſervation could be bold to raiſe abundance of vaine conſequences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for one and the ſame experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there were ſundry reaſons brought, and it was eaſily wreſted, and ſalved by divers principles, I judged that as there was an extreame deale of diligence and nicity to the practicall purſuance of Nature, ſo, that it was not ſafe to draw any one principle from any one obſervation, unleſſe there could not poſſibly be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon given for it, or elſe alike diſcoveries had confirmed it, that if any other interpretation were put upon it, it was unproper and vaine: For as it is eaſie for men of acute wits to miſ-judge and miſ-expect Nature; ſo when an <hi>axiom</hi> is rightly gained, it is eaſie to work it up, and to draw from it many ſtrange and magicall Productions.</p>
            <p>And becauſe there are abundance of extraordinary appearances both at home and abroad, I judged it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that all theſe ſhould be carefully gathered and regiſtred; ſo that thoſe many varieties comming into a long Catalogue, and digeſted by a ſober minde, might
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:50533:23"/>
afford many rare and beautifull diſcoveries of the glory of their Creator.</p>
            <p>What other meanes might be uſed both in this and <hi>Medicine,</hi> would be too large now to inſiſt on, ſince I at firſt purpoſed but a <hi>Synopſis,</hi> which, I cannot deſpair my ſelfe, if it were rightly or hotly purſued, could not but bring forth a more plentifull harveſt then we at the preſent expect. There are, no doubt, many of nobler thoughts, who might furniſh you with more exact and high deſignations; and truly; I ſhall thinke my ſelfe abundantly ſatisfied, if, from theſe poore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, you may be invited to take their advice, and follow their vaſt and judicious conſiderations in this nature. However for my part let this <hi>humble Eſſay</hi> be as much neglected or revil'd as may be, I ſhall ſit down quiet with a conſcience of the diſcharge of my duty, though it can reap no farther, then the putting of theſe wiſhes upon the file, and tranſmitting them to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity.</p>
            <p>Theſe things, as I have but briefly touched, ſo to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularize them had been extreame folly, your Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes being ſo able to direct you, in caſe God ſtir your hearts for to take in hand this taske: which if you cheerfully goe through, no doubt but that gale of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favour, which hath conſtantly gone along with you, will not now leave you, but bring you to the end. And as your eyes have been bleſt with many ſtrange fights, and your mouths oftentimes filled, nay ſtrucken dumbe with wonder; ſo there is no doubt, but if you doe this one thing which now remaines, you ſhall ſee the Taper of a learned Piety burne among us, I hope, like an immortall lampe, fed w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 span">
