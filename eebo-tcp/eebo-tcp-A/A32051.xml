            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>¶ A Proclamation for the removing of the Courts <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> and of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to <hi>Oxford.</hi>

            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEREAS the ſole power of appoynting the Place or Places in which Our Great Courts of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice ſhall be kept, and of removing them from one place to another, as urgent occaſion ſhall move Us, by the Lawes of this Kingdome is inherent in Our Royall Perſon. And whereas it is of great importance to Our ſervice in theſe times of difficulty and diſtraction, to have Our Iudges of Our ſaid Courts to attend neere unto Us, by whoſe advice We may the better proceed in all thoſe Caſes wherein the Iudgement and knowledge of the Lawes is required. And whereas more eſpecially the Chancellor, or Lord Keeper of the Great Seale of England, and the Judges of Our Court, called the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> were and are to follow the King; and Our Court of <hi>Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer,</hi> being the proper Court of Our Revenue, ought to attend Us as We ſhall appoynt. And whereas Our Cities of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> have been, and yet are, the chiefe Cauſers, and Maintainers of this prſent Rebellion againſt Us And We taking into Our ſerious conſideration, that while Our Courts of <hi>Kings-Bench, Common-Pleas,</hi> &amp; of Our <hi>Exchequer</hi> are kept at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> many of Our good and Loyall Subjects might be compelled or injoyned, by Proces in Our name, to make their appearance there, which they could not doe without hazard of Impriſonment, or other dammage or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence from the fomentors of this Rebellion; and many might ſuffer prejudice by Verdicts and Judgements had and obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt them by default or otherwiſe, when they could not with ſafety come to make their juſt defences: thereupon We did reſolve to remove thoſe Courts from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to Our City of <hi>Oxford,</hi> whether other of Our Courts of Iuſtice have been and are already removed by Our former Proclamation. And to the end that there might not be any prejudice to any of Our Subjects, by diſcontinuance of their Suits in thoſe Courts or otherwiſe, We did ſend Our ſeverall Writs of Adjournment, directed to Our Iudges of Our ſaid Courts of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> and <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> and to Our Barons of Out <hi>Exchequer,</hi> thereby commanding and giving Warrant and authority to them reſpectively, to adjourne all Pleas and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces depending before them, in and from the Two and Twentieth day of <hi>November</hi> laſt paſt, to the firſt returne of <hi>Hillary</hi> Terme next, commonly called <hi>Octabis Hillarii,</hi> to be helden then at Our City of <hi>Oxford.</hi> But our Meſſenger ſent with thoſe Writs (as We haue been informed) for no other cauſe but for doing his duty in carrying and delivering thoſe Writs, was impriſoned, and in an unjuſt and illegall way Sentenced to dye, and brought to a place of execution, and threatned to be Hanged, as at that time another of Our Meſſengers for no other cauſe then for doing his duty in the like kind, in carrying Our Proclamations to <hi>London,</hi> was then ſhamefully Hanged and Murthered, (an Act ſo Barbarous as no former age can paraleli) and We have not yet received any certain and particular information touching the execution of thoſe Writs. In purſuance therefore of Our former reſolution of removing thoſe Courts from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to our City of <hi>Oxford,</hi> We doe for the preſent by this Our Proclamation, authorized under Our Great Seale of <hi>England,</hi> Ordaine and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynt, and by theſe preſents publiſh and Declare Our Will and Pleaſure to be, That Our ſaid Courts of <hi>Kings-Bench</hi> and <hi>Exchequer,</hi> ſhall for the next <hi>Hillary</hi> Terme, at the uſuall and accuſtomed time for holding of the ſame, be holden and kept at Our ſaid City of <hi>Oxford,</hi> and not at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and ſhall be continued and kept there during that whole Terme and afterwards at the ſeverall times and Termes for holding and keeping of thoſe Courts, untill Our farther pleaſure be known and publiſhed for removing them from <hi>Oxford.</hi> And We doe hereby ſtraightly charge and Command, all Our Iudges of Our ſaid Court of <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> and Our Barons of Our <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and all Officers, Protonotaries, Clerkes, <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 span">
