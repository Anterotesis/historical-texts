            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And I appeale to all indifferent men, to judge if I have not juſt cauſe to free my ſelfe from the hands of thoſe who change their principles with their condition, and who are not a ſhamed openly to intend the diſtruction of the Nobility, by taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way their negative voice, and with whom the Levelers Doctrine, is rather countenanced then puniſhed, and as for their intentions to my Perſon, their changing and putting more ſtrict Guards upon me, with the diſcharging most of all thoſe ſervants of mine, who formerly they willingly admitted to waite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, do ſufficiently declare. Nor would I have this my retirement miſ-interpreted for, I ſhall earneſtly and unceſsantly endeavour the ſetling of a ſafe and well-grounded peace where-ever I am, or shall be, and that (as much as may be) without the effuſion of more Chriſtian Blood, for which how many tims have I Deſired, preſs't to the Head, and yet no Eare given to me: and can any reaſonable man thinke that (according to the ordinary courſe of affaires there can be a Setled Peace without it, or that God will bleſs thoſe, who refuſe to heare their owne King, ſurely no, Nay J muſt further adde that (beſides what concernes my ſelfe) unleſs all other cheiſe intereſts have not only a hearing but likewiſe juſt ſatisfaction given unto them, (to witt the PRESBITERIANS, INDEPENDANTS, ARMIE, thoſe who have adheared to mee, and even the SCOTS) I ſaie there cannot (I ſpeake not of miracles, it being in my opinion a ſinfull preſumption in ſuch caſes to expect or truſt to them) be a ſafe and laſting peace: Now as J cannot deny but that my perſonall ſecurity is the urgent cauſe of this my retirement. So J take God to witneſs that the publik peace is no leſs before my Eyes, and J can find no better way to expreſs this my profeſsion (J know not what a wiſer man may doe) then by deſiring and urging that all chiefe Jntereſts may be heard, to the end each may have juſt satisfaction, as for example, the army (for the reſt though neceſsary yet J ſuppoſe are not difficult to conſent) ought (in my Judgement) to enjoy the liberty of their conſciences, and have an act of Oblivion, or Indempnity (which should extend to the reſt of all my Subjects) and that all their arreares ſhould be ſpeedily and duely paid which J will undertake to doe so J may be heard, and tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
