         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the arguing whereof, many ancient and modern Writers have taken great pains in ſearching out and deſcribing (for memories ſake) unto poſteritie, who were the firſt diſcoverers of that noble Science or Myſtery of the healing mans body; but not without ſeverall and different opinions, and ſtrong contradict<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praeſcientia Dei,</hi> onely of the fore-knowledge of God. Wherefore to attribute ſo great excellencies, ſo many wayes in uſe for the health and wel-being of mankind, to any other than to the divine bounty of God alone, would ſeem (in my apprehenſion) not much leſſe than blaſphemy; for it could never be, that humane reaſon could have found out the knowledge and vertues of theſe things, unleſſe God himſelf by his ſecret preſcience had ſhewed them to man.</p>
                  <p>For God, the Architector of the world, when in the beginning he created <hi>Adam,</hi> and inſpired him with the ſpirit of life, made him not onely a living creature, but alſo indued him with ſuch underſtanding, that he knew the natures, the forces, the proper faculties, virtues, and dangerous effects of al things which the ſaid univerſal world then con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tained or produced: ſo that the glory of the invention of the myſtery of healing of mans body, came from God himſelf, and may not be ſo much undervalued as to be aſcribed to humane ingenuitie. Yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe (under favonr) we may ſo far venture to conceive, that the<note place="margin">The gift of healing is no leſſe then one of the gifts of the H.

<pb facs="tcp:37024:10"/>
they might be the better enabled to ſearch out and apply wholſome medicines in due ſeaſon, according as they were inſpired or taught; for all excellent knowledge commeth from above: and this opinion is alſo aſſented unto by holy Scriptures in ſundry places.</p>
                  <p>But withall, complying with our Anceſtors as much as may be, touching the firſt generall profeſſors of this art of Medicine; The moſt Writers affirm the <hi>Grecians</hi> were the firſt that tooke upon them to profeſſe the art of Medicine, and they likewiſe utter ſpeeches to the ſame effect, affirming <hi>Apollo</hi> to be the firſt Inventor of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine; and by <hi>Apollo,</hi> it is ſuggeſted, that they either underſtood the Sunne, which through the penetrating heat thereof, produceth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth, tempereth and cheriſheth all creatures as well animall, and vegetable, as minerall: Or they meant, under that name of <hi>Apollo,</hi> ſome Noble man, who was inſtigated thereunto through an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and divine power (no doubt by Gods fore-knowledge) and alſo endued with learning and diligence in that noble art of Medicine, who performed ſome excellent cures: alluding whereunto, <hi>Ovid</hi> ſpeaketh thus of <hi>Apollo,</hi>

                  </lg>
                  <p>And after <hi>Apollo</hi> the ſucceeding Inventor is ſaid to be <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> which ome Writers ſtile to be his ſonne, brought up in learning by him, who did ſomewhat more ſet forth and poliſh this Art, being as then rude and ruſtick, and therefore he was reputed as one of the gods. Not long after thoſe times (as Writers report) did flouriſh <hi>Chyron,</hi> termed the <hi>Centaure,</hi> who alſo excelled in the knowledge of the medicinall plants.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> (as other ancient Hiſtories witneſſe) had two ſonnes, <hi>viz. Podalyrius</hi> and <hi>Machaon,</hi> who followed their Fathers ſteps, and profeſſed the art of Medicine, and cured the wounded ſouldiers in the Trojan Wars; and theſe chiefly practiſed that part of healing which is now called Surgery. After them the knowledge of the art of Medicine grealy increaſed, though for a time it was in a hereditary way left by them to their poſteritie; and through their ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and diligence was that part called Phyſick which cureth inward diſeaſes, alſo by a more prudent and diligent ſearch found out.</p>
                  <p>And further, authors witneſſe, that out of this moſt learned <hi>Aeſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapius</hi> his Stock, did ſpring <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> begot by <hi>Heraclida</hi> in the Ile of <hi>Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And after him ſix hundred yeares followed <hi>Galen,</hi> a man not only exquiſite in the knowledge of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
<pb facs="tcp:37024:10"/>
but alſo in many other ſciences. And what was left in the writings of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> obſcure and intricate, <hi>Galen</hi> faithfully interpred and illuſtrated it, and put it into many Volumes, and eſtabliſhed univerſal precepts, and methodical rules, and reduced the Science into a more perfect Art.</p>
                  <p>And further, we read in Hiſtories, in the infancie of this art, that it was a cuſtome amongſt the <hi>Babylonians</hi> and <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> who then were very ignorant in the art of healing, to appoint the ſick languiſhing people to be carried and laid in Porches and Galleries, or to carry them into the Market places and croſſe Streets, that paſſengers might counſell and exhort them to thoſe things, by which they might eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chue the like diſeaſes, or had known ſome to be recovered: and it was not lawfull for any one to paſſe by the ſick with ſilence, but he muſt utter ſome words of comfort at the leaſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Strabo</hi> alſo (a Greek Writer) witneſſeth, that it was of old a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome amongſt the <hi>Grecians</hi> for the ſick to betake themſelves unto the <hi>Epida<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Such was the zeal and ſuperſtitious blindneſs of the heathen people in former ages, and the ceremonies which they performed in a grateful remembrance for future times.</p>
                  <p>Alſo <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is reported to have copied out all thoſe things, and ſo from them firſt to have amended the medicinall art. And it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by the ancients reported, that brute creatures have bin much conducible to the firſt finding out of ſome particulars in this art: ſo that man not only from man, but alſo from brute beaſts and birds, hath learned many good things, which by them have been demonſtrated, as namely, the vertues of divers herbs, by which they did preſerve themſelves from diſeaſes, through the mere inſtinct of nature, (as the blindneſs of the young Swallowes is ſaid to be removed by the herb <hi>Celedona,</hi> &amp;c.)</p>
                  <p>Seeing therefore ſo great and ſo many good helps have concurred together to the perfection of this excellent art of Medicine, for the health and wel-being of mankind, who then needs to doubt thereof, or may ſay that it did not proceed, as from the beginning, <hi>de praeſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entia Dei?</hi> ſeeing that man, the moſt noble of all the creatures of God, and for whoſe ſake all other earthly creatures were created, receiveth ſuch unſpeakable comforts thereby: which cauſed <hi>Herophilus</hi> hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to term the medicinall Science to be the hand of God: for (ſaith he) as we having got a fall, do with our ſtretched-out hand endevour to free our ſelves out of that dirt or pit we were fallen into; even ſo we, being at the point of death by the aſſaults of ſickneſſe, do ſuccour our ſelves by the ſalutiferous remedies of good Medicines, and do thereby, as it were, draw our ſelves out of the jaws of death; ſo as <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> the Prince of the Greek Poets, doth affirm in his verſes, that one good man that can heal well, is more worth then divers other men
<pb facs="tcp:37024:11"/>
ignorant in that art: for what perſon is, or can be more neceſſary, or more uſefull in any Common-wealth or place, then the expert Artiſt, skilfull in the divine ſcience of healing? which Science bringeth a man in favour with men of all degrees, yea, to be acceptable to Princes Kings and Emperors, being both profitable and commodious every where to Prince and people for the preſerving of health, and repelling of diſeaſes from them and their ſubjects, which alſo gaineth to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf honour and riches: for, as Hiſtories record, unto <hi>Hippocrates</hi> by King <hi>Abderas</hi> (for healing of <hi>Democritus</hi> his madneſſe) was given an extraordinary great reward; and moreover the heathen nation, men, women and children, gathered themſelves together, and in a trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant manner proclaimed him (with aloud voice) to be the ſaving god, and honoured him with the name of <hi>Pater Patriae,</hi> the father of their Countrey. And the <hi>Athenians,</hi> becauſe he had freed <hi>Athens</hi> from the peſtilence, celebrated playes with triumphant pomp to his honour, placing on his head a crown of gold weighing a thouſand crownes, and honoured him with the great magnificence of a King; and likewiſe built him a ſtatue for a perpetuall eternizing of his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and learning.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo reported by ancient Writers, that one <hi>Eraſiſtratus, Ariſtotles</hi> nephew, received by a voluntary contriburion from King <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> an hundred talents of gold, as a reward, for that he reftored his ſonne to health from a deſperate diſeaſe: and likewiſe, that <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the Emperor appointed rich ſtatues to be ſet up to the honour of <hi>Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Muſa:</hi> and that one <hi>Quintus Stertinius</hi> received yearly for about 50. years together, out of the Emperors treaſury at <hi>Rome,</hi> twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand crowns for his great skill in the myſtery of healing: and that if any ſick perſon of ſort did call him out of the Citie for his advice, he did pay him 50. crownes a day for his skill. Moreover, it is ſaid, that for curing Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> the third, he every moneth received foure hundred crownes out of the Treaſurie of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ancient Hiſtories make mention, that in former times the moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and honourable perſonages (yea, Kings and Princes) were greatly delighted in the ſtudy thereof, eſteeming themſelves much graced and dignified thereby; and thereupon, being greedy of getting renown, have given plants denominations from their own names, as <hi>Gentian</hi> from <hi>Gentins</hi> King of the <hi>Aſſyrians; Lyſimachia,</hi> an Engliſh water-wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, from <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> King of the <hi>Macedonians;</hi> the compoſition of <hi>Mithridate</hi> from <hi>Mithridates</hi> King of <hi>Pontus</hi> and <hi>Bythinia;</hi> the herb <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chillea</hi> from <hi>Achilles; Centauri</hi> from <hi>Chyron</hi> the <hi>Centaure; Arthemaſia</hi> from <hi>Caria</hi> Queen pf <hi>Arthemaſia.</hi> And further, Writers do affirm, <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talus</hi> King of <hi>Pergamus, Solomon</hi> King of the <hi>Jewes, Evax</hi> King of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and <hi>Iuba</hi> King of the <hi>Moores,</hi> with infinite more (too long to recite) did as it were burn with a deſire of learning the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinall art, ſome in the herball part, others in the ſearching the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of drugs, others of minerals, and did alſo write and compoſe whole volumes in that Myſterie, for the benefit of poſteritie yet extant; wherein are contained infinite ſalutiferous Antidotes, by the
<pb facs="tcp:37024:11"/>
mixture of many ſimples into one medicine.</p>
                  <p>And whereas there hath been a queſtion amongſt ſome of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, by what name they may moſt properly call the Artiſt; the more learned ſort are juſtly ſtiled by the title of Phyſicians, and the more experienced ſort are called Chirurgions, or Surgeons; by means whereof, ſometimes there hath grown difference and offence, which I doe adviſe each diſcreet Surgeon to avoid, and that they give the Phyſician his due honour and precedence, compariſons being odious and unmannerly amongſt good men. Alſo the Artiſt of old, before the art was diſtinguiſhed, was called amongſt the <hi>Grecians Iatros,</hi> and amongſt the <hi>Latines, Medicus,</hi> and in our countries ancient language, by report, he was termed a <hi>Leech:</hi> and all thoſe denominations ſignifie no other thing but one and the ſame, <hi>viz. A curer of diſeaſes, ſickneſſes, wounds, apoſtmues, ulcers, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whereas all men may judge ſuch infirmities cannnt be cured without fit inſtruments, which are firſt and chiefly by the hand of man, (who doth make ready fit medicaments and applications) to be adminiſtred to the foreſaid diſeaſes in due order and time: The firſt inſtrumental part of Medicine was, and is, that which both the ancient and later writers term <hi>Chirurgia,</hi> or the Handy part of healing.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is <hi>Dieta:</hi> a ſpecial inſtrument to cure, without which neither wounds, apoſtumes, ulcerations, nor tumors againſt nature (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen</hi> do affirm) can well be cured; for that diet muſt be preſcribed according to the temperature of the body, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the wounded part: and <hi>Galen</hi> alſo preſcribeth a diet for thoſe that have ulcerations, whether cancrous or otherwiſe proceeding. Wherefore I conceive him to be no juſt and charitable Judge, that denieth this inſtrument, namely diet, to belong to a Chirurgion as well as to a Phyſician: for that reaſon and experience both do allow and approve thereof, as an unlimitable inſtrument, <hi>fine quibus eſſe ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit.</hi> And whereas <hi>Galen</hi> ſaith, <hi>in lib.</hi> 3. <hi>De methodo medendi,</hi> all arts are grounded upon experience and reaſon: if any one can declare, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by experience or reaſon, a way how to cure ulcers, tumors, wounds, fiſtulaes and other like diſeaſes incident to mans body, as the French Pox, the Plague &amp;c. the cures of which diſeaſes by ſtatute Lawes are appointed to Surgeons, and to do it without the uſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and other both inward and outward helps, which theſe learned men (as <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen)</hi> uſed, and have with no ſmall labour found out by reaſon and experience, then I will eaſily yield, and be glad to learn, and will not onely learn, but highly extol it: but if on the contrary, no man can ſhew me any other way to heal the former recited diſeaſes; then I ſee no juſt hinderance, but that each true Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, being legally a Surgeon expert, may and ought freely to make uſe of diet to perform his cures.</p>
                  <p>The third general inſtrument uſed in the curing of diſeaſes, is <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macum,</hi> in Latine, <hi>Medicamentum,</hi> or Medicine, granted to be of ſeveral ſorts. Each man will conceive that medicine is a principal part of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and curing of ſores, diſeaſes and ſickneſſes: for who is he that
<pb facs="tcp:37024:12"/>
can cure a wound, a tumor, an ulcer, yea, but an ague with his hand onely, without fitting medicines? Surely no man: Then it muſt neceſſarily follow, that <hi>Chyrurgia, Dieta, &amp; Pharmacum, viz.</hi> Surgery Diet and Medicines (I mean both outward and inward) are unſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable companions, and therefore all to be uſed in the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> art of curing mans body; and that in the perſon of one man, and why not in the Surgeon that practiſeth in military occaſions, as in ſhips and camps more eſpecially? where neither his Majeſtie nor the Merchant allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Phyſicians nor Apothecaries any place, and there the whole ſcope of healing the bodies of the braveſt and moſt valiant warriours and hardie Sea-men, are upon all occaſions wholly referred to the skill of the Surgeon. Wherefore it were a very ungodly thing, and in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon moſt unjuſt, to forbid a Surgeon to learn all, or any thing that concerneth his calling: and all thoſe that are of opinion to hinder a Surgeon from uſing outward and inward medicines, have quite miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrued <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Gale<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I have, I confeſs, too long inſiſted upon this argument, but the cauſe is, there be ſome at this day that do indeavor to ſever the inſtruments of healing aſunder, againſt the publick good, for their own private lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre, and would have inward medicine practiſed onely by themſelves, and confine the Surgeon onely to outward medicine, and outward healing, as one <hi>Tragus</hi> an ancient Writer maketh mention, affirming, that there were certain ſorts of men in his dayes which did uſe the art of curing ſeverally; namely, ſome by inward medicines onely, and ſome by outward, and ſome by diet onely, every one according to his education and profeſſion of curing: all theſe three contending, and each one affirming his way the beſt; in concluſion, their errours were confuted by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> who gave to each of them (as learned Writers affirm) a patient to cure, whom all of them endeavouring to recover, failed in their performance: notwithſtanding, afterward by the wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and skill of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> they all were reconciled and united; for he, having well weighed and conſidered each of their weakneſſes and errours, willed them apart to ſet down how long time he, or they would take, to cure his or their appointed diſeaſed patients; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he and the reſt agreed on a ſet time; which being expired, <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> found that although each Artiſt had ſhewed his utmoſt skill, yet their patients were not accordingly cured. Hereupon he with much mildneſſe and kind perſwaſions (as is recorded) ſo appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and inſtructed them, that each of them by the very ſame means and medicines they formerly took, being all uſed together to each party, quickly and perfectly cured their ſeverall patients. Whereby al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo it is manifeſt, that it is not juſt nor ſafe for the Common-wealth, neither can it be approved, that the beſt of the antient Fathers in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick

As alſo he was further tied (for his owne reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſake) to performe the ſame in ſome methodicall and plaine way.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe untill that time no Writer (that he could poſſibly finde out) had ever handled or written any thing worthie of note of that ſubject, namely, of the methodicall compoſure of a militarie Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons Cheſt; he was put upon the toyle and ſtudie of new inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for the fit compoſure of medicines and inſtruments, and that without the helpe of Authours, yea, and without the help of the Surgeons themſelves, that were to uſe the ſaid Cheſts, who (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the more ignorant ſort of them) for their own private ends, and in part to cover their imperfections and abſurdities, forcibly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood him.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving an intent to ſet down Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for Surgeons Mates, out of my love to them, I thought it meet in a word or two to put them in mind alſo of their duties. The office &amp; dutie of a Surgeons Mate, may (in my opinion) well be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into three parts, whereof the firſt concerneth his dutie to God, who ſeeth not as man ſeeth, and who is the ſearcher of the heart, and knoweth mens thoughts long before, whom if he and I have the grace to honour with our whole hearts and fear, he wil direct our waies aright.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond dutie of the Surgeons Mate, is concerning the chief Surgeon, towards whom he muſt be carefull to behave himſelf wiſely, lovingly and diligently: and in many reſpects he is obliged to his<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mate as the wife to her husband; for he ought to be to him in every point readie to obey his reaſonable will, <hi>I</hi> mean onely in things concerning his calling, dutifull, diligent, willing, carefull, ſecret, and loving, yea, and to ſhew his love in covering his Mates weakneſs: he ought alſo to be gentle, and kind in ſpeech and actions towards all: pitifull to them that are diſeaſed, and diligent in miniſtring to them ſuch fitting remedies as he ſhall receive, or be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to give from his Mate; but none without his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for that his Mates order, I mean the Surgeons or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is his diſcharge or warrant, whatever happen: yet let
<pb facs="tcp:37024:17"/>
him privately lend his beſt adviſe to his Mate, the prime Surgeon, upon every needfull occaſion, kindly, ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively and lovingly, ever as under correction; for if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons or oppoſition take place betwixt them, it is not onely dangerous to all the ſhips company, but alſo a diſgrace to themſelves, and a great ſcandal to their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: for avoyding which, it is fit that the yonger obey the elder, and beware of the contrary, leſt it be repented too late. S. <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth ſervants to obey froward Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, ſo I adviſe Surgeons Mates to do the like to fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Surgeons: for it ſheweth no excellent thing in a yong man to pleaſe an honeſt quiet man, but to live in love with an ambitious, or otherwiſe a froward vicious man, ſheweth wiſdom in the ſufferer. I would not ſo ſtand upon this point, but that my experience hath known too much the great harm that hath enſued by the diſſention of the Surgeon and his Mate in Iong voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, the which with diſcretion and love might have bin prevented, if but one of them both had bin wiſe. The Surgeons Mate ought alſo daily to viſit the Cabins of men, to ſee who hath any ſickneſſe or imperfection: alſo to have ready againſt occaſion lint made, Plaiſters ſpred, splints armed, Needles prepared for ſtitching wounds, Rowlers and Boulſters, Dorſels, Tents, Buttons, Caps, Pledgents, Tape, rowling needles, and threed prepared, and each other needful thing for his calling, ready in their convenient places, fitted againſt occaſion be. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe his care muſt be to keep all the inſtruments of the Cheſt, and of his own Box, clean from ruſting, and to ſet his Lancets and Raſors as oft as need is. It may be he wil ſay to himſelf, it is a baſe office, belonging to meer Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Grinders, I never gave any mind to it, &amp;c. But let me friendly tell the Surgeons Mate, it is the credit of a yong Artiſt to take a vein ſmoothly and neatly, as alſo to ſhave well is praiſe-worthy: wherefore I wiſh him to practiſe to do it, and to be ever learning; for I am ſure he ſhall never know half he ought to know, though he do his beſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:37024:17"/>
Thirdly, if he enter into conſideration wherefore he goeth to Sea, and hazzardeth his life. I ſuppoſe it is to gain, or he is unwiſe: if to gain, the chief gain he can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, being a Mate, is knowledge in his calling. Then let him conſider wiſely how he may beſt apply himſelf to effect ſuch gains, namely by obſerving the whole paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the diſeaſed people, conſidering both when they began to be ſick, as near as he can, the cauſes thereof, what hath been applied either inwardly or outwardly, what operation the medicine had, and ſo of every diſeaſed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and every medicine given; and to keep a Journall in writing of the daily paſſages of the voyage in that kind, and that as well of the unſucceſſive applications, as of the ſucceſsive, he ſhall find great benefit in both: Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe what alterations of operations he findeth in each medicine, and what medicines keep their force longeſt, and what periſh ſooneſt; alſo what varietie the climate cauſeth, of the Doſes as well of the laxative as opiate Medicines: I heartily wiſh each Surgeons Mate were carefull in theſe points. Another good way for him to learn is, to read much, I mean in Chyrurgery and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and well to conſider and bear in mind what he reads, that as he hath need of the help of his Books, he may again find the thing he once read, which will turn much to his profit: for otherwiſe what uſe hath a man of reading, if he forget it preſently? If a Surgeons Mate ſpend his time wiſely in the premiſes, he may do good ſervice to God, his Countrie, and himſelf, and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit will be his, namely, Gods favour, preferment, credit and reputation in the world will be gained thereby, which will bring abundance of good things with it, which God grant for his mercie ſake. And were it not that I have intended this plain Treatiſe wholy to the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons Mate, I would in a word or two put the young Sea-Surgeon himſelf in mind of his charge, by admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing him of ſome errors too groſſe, which I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to have been committed by ſome, that he might avoid the like in himſelf.</p>

                     <pb facs="tcp:37024:18"/>
The firſt errour ſome yong Surgeons are poſſeſt with, from which infinite others grow, is the want of the ſervice of God, the example whereof to their Mates is very infectious; and this bringeth with it a blaſpheming the name of the Almightie, a general deboiſt and baſe kind of habit on them, ready for all unprofitable, idle, and unſeemly actions, and unapt for to proſecute any good thing, either in their callings, or otherwiſe: and if they ſeem to be any thing, it is in boſting and brave phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, cenſuring other men in many things, but not percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their own wretchedneſs at all. Being given and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to the Pot and tobacco-pipe in ſuch an unreaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable meaſure, that thereby they become in themſelves baſe, deſpiſing vertue and commending vice; and to their Mates they ſhew themſelves moſt unkind, keeping that little knowledge they have from them, not inſtructing them at all in their Science, and holding them in more baſe ſubiection then their maſters ever did in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentiſhip. Alſo of a proud laſie diſpoſition command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them (without due inſtructions) to do the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, when indeed themſelves ought to put their hands even to thoſe parts of Surgery which they eſteem baſeſt; for the moſt lamentable diſeaſes of poor men require the moſt care of the Surgeon, as for example, the ulcerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſlidings downof <hi>Ani</hi> or the <hi>Arſ-gut,</hi> which ſome in diſdaining to do their office of fomenting, comforting and reſtoring thereof to the due place, moſt inhumanely have cut it off, when with as good a conſcience they might have cut their Patients his throat: and the ſame I ſay to him that is negligent, and ſuffereth ſuch to periſh in their infirmities, without doing his utmoſt diligence. I could name ſome of the parties who have much diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced themſelves and the noble Science: but I will be cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, hoping they will amend; and conclude with an old Grammer verſ, worthy the remembrance of al men;

In the ſecond view of the Surgery Cheſt, is deſcribed (and as it were ſet open to be viewed) a Cheſt fitted for a great Ship upon a long Voyage for Sea ſervice; as ſuppoſe for an Eaſt India Voyage. And wherein this ſecond is not ſufficiently explained, the firſt (if you pleaſe to repair unto it) ſhall give you further ſatisfaction. As for the third proportion, it is a Surgeons Cheſt epitomized, or a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring proportion, as ſuppoſe chiefly ordained for the curing of wounds either with Gun-ſhot or other caſualties, and accidents in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties ſervice for a Voyage on a ſudden, to ſerve upon or near our own Coaſt, where additions (if occaſion be) cannot be wanting in every Port Town.

                     <p>AL theſe waters and ſpirits rehearſed, though in themſelves they be good, yet if any of the beſt of them be abuſed, and immoderately taken, they may as ſoon do harm as profit: I adviſe therefore no man to make a common uſe of them, or any of them, which hath a young able body, and may have a good diet at his pleaſure: for they are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be uſed at ſea, where mens bodies (by variety of the venemous vapours and evil diſpoſitions of the aire, or unkind diet) are in hazzard; or where there is a weak ſtomack, evil digeſtion, with a loathing diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to meat, evil appetite, and too much looſneſſe of the belly; alſo where by extream heat and ſweat, the ſpirits of the body are exhauſted and ſpent, or where (through the extream cold of the ſame) the body is much annoyed and endangered: In all theſe, and infinite more evils incident to mens bodies abroad and at home theſe precious liquors miniſter preſent comfort. They alſo are very behoveful to aged people after their meats to help digeſtion, or them which have weak ſtomacks, or that are of ſad and melancholy diſpoſitions; for it muſt not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that wine comforteth the heart of man; and theſe waters having their original and whole force from the ſpirit or life of the wine, do thereby exhilarate mans heart, and give him courage, as well as cure his infirmities.</p>
                     <p>If therefore theſe waters be truly made, they ought alſo to be ſtrong of the ſpirit of wine, otherwiſe they will not keep long good, neither are they profitable nor wholſome, and being good, one ſpoonful at one time is ſufficient, or two ſpoonfuls at the moſt, for the preſerving of health: they are beſt to be taken faſting, one hour or two after dinner, and laſt at night, either alone, or with beere or wine; ſome make a toſte faſting, and drop the ſame full of cordial water and ſo eat it, and that is very good.</p>
                     <p>In gripings of the guts, collick or flixes of the belly, proceeding of cold cauſes or much crudity, three ſpoonfuls or four may be uſed at once in a Glifter; but you muſt not boil it therein, onely put it in when it is ready to be adminiſtred; for if you do otherwiſe, the ſpirit will evaporate and be of no force.</p>

Note that the firſt time you begin injection, it be very gently done, then you may fortifie it as you ſee cauſe; namely, give it of it ſelf, or with the addition of a little well dulcified <hi>Mercury</hi> where occaſion is, but that warily; namely, ſeldom or never within the paſſage, 'but twixt <hi>glans</hi> and <hi>praeputium</hi> dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (if you will) upon juſt occaſion; and adminiſter no <hi>Lotion</hi> within the paſſage of <hi>Virga</hi> cold, but warm ever. Further it hath the prime place, for a Catholick medicine in exulcerations and excoriations of the mouth and throat, both in Town and Country, and is become in ſuch caſes every old wives medicine: I have touched it in the cure of the Scurvy, wherefore here for brevities ſake, I crave pardon: Onely, let me tell the Surgeons Mate, that in want of ſuch a <hi>Lotion,</hi> though it be not in all points anſwerable thereto, yet he may make a good <hi>Lotion</hi> at ſea of freſh water, Allome, and Hony, provided he be wary not to be too plentiful of the Allome.</p>

                     <p>THis kind of Cauſtick taketh his vertue from the vegetable ſalt it contains, and may well be carried in the Cheſt, for that it will laſt well an Eaſt-India Voyage, with (ſome times) the addition of a little capital lees, as need ſhall require; namely, when it groweth too hard. It is altogether as ſafe and ſure as the Cauſtick ſtone, but not ſo ſwift in working, neither ſo well to be ruled; for it will often ſpread three times as wide as it is intended, if it be not warily prevented: which thing is dangerous to the Patient, and diſgraceful to the Artiſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if I had capital lees I would rather boyle up the Cauſtick ſtone; but then again, except the Surgeons Mate know the true height of boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it, and can cut it into pieces one half inch long (as is ſaid) and with
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:37024:54"/>
one of the ſaid pieces held in his one hand can perforate the apoſtume, otherwiſe it is all one with the former white Cauſticks for being laid on, it will become liquid as the other. It is not ſufficiently ſafe to cut a hole, (as the uſe is) in a ſpread emplaſter, of the bigneſſe he would have his orifice, and ſo lay it on, and cover it with a like emplaſter; for that this courſe cannot hinder the ſpreading thereof; but if he will work ſurely after that faſhion, I mean with any potential cauſtick medicine, let him cut from a roll of ſome ſoft emplaſter that will cleave well, a piece of one ounce in weight, or thereabout, and make of it two long rolles, laying one on each ſide the place of the apoſtume appointed to be pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, bringing them at each end together, for the ends of a cauſtick inciſion ought to be narrow, and the middeſt broad, if it be artificial; at leaſt twice as long as broad is a good form, and rather more. Regard alſo that your inciſion be made (as near as may be) according to the length of the fibres and muſcles, and alwayes that it be ſo made, that one end be more dependent then the other: But in Bubo's of the emunctories, it will ſeldom fall out ſo, for that you are conſtrained to follow the form of the tumour, which commonly lieth thwart, chiefly in venereal Bubo's <hi>in inguine,</hi> or the groine. Likewiſe if the tumour be full, and the Patient in great pain, you ſhall do him great eaſe by piercing the <hi>Esker</hi> in the middeſt, ſo ſoon as it is made, to diſcharge ſome of the matter. But note this as a general rule, never preſſe out the matter too forcibly, nor take too much at once out. For howſoever you may juſtly alledge and conceive, it is putrid and offenſive matter; yet know, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth natural colour, and ſome ſpirits, and any ſudden evacuation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will weaken and perhaps overthrow your Patient. Wherefore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome extraordinary cauſe urge you thereto, force not much matter from a ſuppurated Apoſtume, but leave that work to nature onely, and hinder not the due courſe thereof, by the fooliſh uſe of ſtopping the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice with a tent; for ſo thou ſhalt become an enemy to thy Patient, and not onely hinder his natural help (far above thy artificial help) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo uncharitably thou wilt choke him up in his own excrements; which beware of. And for the furthering the fall of an <hi>Esker</hi> in an Apoſtume, where nature hath a breathing, it is meer folly, as I have ſaid in other place. The longer it lyeth on, the better I like the work, and if you would uſe all the art you can, you cannot keep on an <hi>Esker</hi> at your will: wherefore forget that work till it be done to thy hand.</p>

                     <p>THis extract is a laxative medicine (being drawn from the moſt excellent of vegetable laxative ingredients) fitting to be ever ready at hand in a Surgeons Cheſt, or elſe where in Surgery. The doſe is ſmall, namely, 15. grains at the moſt: the taſt pleaſant, not nauſeous nor bitter at all; neither cauſing tortions, nor gripings in the bowells: It is a medicine that will keep good for ſeven years without putrefaction, the vertues whereof have been by the Author (for many years well experienced) both at Sea and Land approved of. Now for that it is the honour of every expert Artiſt, <hi>Cito, tutè, &amp; jucundè ſanare;</hi> that is, quickly, ſafely, and pleaſantly to perform his ſcope in the comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and curing of his patient, I have therefore thought fit to recommend the uſe hereof to the Surgeon, to be practiſed by him, as well in military, as Domeſtick occaſions.</p>

                        <pb n="57" facs="tcp:37024:59"/>
And this medicine that here I commend to the reader, anſwereth fitly thoſe fornamed attributes, by reaſon of his gentle and eaſie ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in ſafe purging <hi>per ſeceſſum,</hi> or downward; It exceedeth other purgatives therein, the doſe being duly obſerved; for it purgeth the head, the ſtomack, the belly and liver of all groſſe offending hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, either flegmatick, cholerick, or melancholy; alſo it purgeth watty and ſlimy humours, and taketh away the chollick or gripings of the bowels; and withall, it comforteth the ſtomack; yea, any child, or woman with child, may ſafely take hereof. It is beſt to be taken faſting in a morning, and to eat in three hours after the receipt thereof, onely the party may take drink, or rather (which were beſt) warm broth, or in want thereof poſſet drink, or beer for a need ſomewhat warmed; and the party that taketh it; were beſt he keep within his Chamber, and not to ſleep in the time of the working of the medicines; but if he goeth out, urged by his neceſſities, being careful to keep himſelf warm he is in no danger thereby, although I confeſſe to keep in were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                     <p>And whereas <hi>Paracelſus</hi> ſaith, that every good laxative medicine, ought to contain in general three operations or faculties as proper to it; namely, Firſt, that it purge nature without offence of danger; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that it ſtrengthen nature being debilitated or weakned; Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it do comfort nature; yet the ſaid Author is of opinion, and that juſtly, that the excellency of purgative medicines is not alwayes to be judged of by the numbers of ſtools it provoketh, but much more for the <hi>Artanum</hi> thereof, or hidden ſpecifical power it hath in the curing and rooting out of diſeaſes, although they be inveterate.</p>
                     <p>And moreover this medicine is very ſafe to be given in caſes of the plague, or ſmall pox, where, and when, by advice a purge is fitting to be given.</p>

For which cauſe a wound is ſaid to differ in his deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination: for ſometimes it is called a thruſt or punction, which is made by ſtabbing with any thing ſharp pointed, as a Dagger, Rapier, or the<note place="margin">The divers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellations of wounds.</note> like: ſometimes it is named a Contuſion, when by a weighty thing of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending (as timber) falling down, or violently caſt down (as a ſtone) the fleſh is bruiſed and broken: ſometimes alſo it hath the appellation of Inciſion, or inciſed wound, for that it is done by an edged inſtrument, as a knife or ſword. And theſe wounds are either ſimple or compound: the ſimple are onely in the upper skin or fleſh, without detriment or loſſe of ſubſtance, which alſo have their ſeveral ſpecies or kinds, becauſe of their divers forms; ſome being greater or ſmaller, profound or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, long or little, ſtreight, round or crooked, of a facile cure, of difficile, or mortal. And for the ſounder judgment and better cure of all wounds, (which are either external, or internal and penetrating) there are ſeveral ſignes (of ancient tradition) with much diligence to be had in remembrance, which daily practice alſo verifieth.</p>
                  <p>The ſeveral differences of all external wounds are diſcerned by ſight or handling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The places of internall wounds.</note> Thoſe which are termed internal and penetrating wounds, are either in the head, breaſt, or inferiour venter, and are diſcovered likewiſe by ſight, by feeling, or by ſearching with an inſtrument into them.</p>
                  <p>The hurt or ruption of the membranes or brain is accompanied with ſneeſing, vomitting, bleeding at the noſe or eares<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> raving and the like: but if the ſubſtance of the brain be hurt, thoſe ſignes are encreaſed, and a bilious or ſharp vomitting is ſeen; alſo a fever, dull underſtanding, with alteration of favour and countenance do enſue; ſtupidity alſo and dumb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe ſignifie the brain contuſed.</p>
                  <p>The breaſt is obſerved to be wounded and penetrated, when aire com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth forth of the wound, or when the perſon ſick hath in his mouth a ſenſe of the things applied to his grief.</p>
                  <p>It appeareth that the lungs are hurt, if the reſpiration be difficult, a
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:37024:74"/>
a ratling ſound in breathing be heard, and the excrement which is voided from the mouth be ſpumous, pale, and crude.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Pericranium</hi> hurt hath ſometimes ſudden and often ſwounding for a ſign, though ſome nevertheleſſe having the <hi>Penicranium</hi> wounded or contuſed, have no evil ſymptomes extraordinary to other mean wounds of other parts.</p>
                  <p>The Heart wounded hath the refrigeration of all the parts, extinction of natural heat, and death attending thereon.</p>
                  <p>If the great Veins and Arteries in the breaſt be offended, and immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate flux of blood, defection of vertue in all the faculties, a cold and an unſavoury ſweat doth enſue, and death within a few hours.</p>
                  <p>The ſolution of continuity in the ſinewie parts of the <hi>Diaphragma,</hi> cauſeth convulſion, difficile reſpiration, an acute fever, raving, and death: but if the fleſhy part onely be agrieved, it is capable of remedies, and ſuffereth not ſuch dangerous ſymptomes.</p>
                  <p>If the recurrent Nerves be wounded, there followeth loſſe of ſpeech immediate motion and ſenſe alſo is ſuppreſſed, and that without recovery.</p>
                  <p>In the wounds of the Liver appear vomiting, bloody dejections, much pain, a continual fever; and if they be deep, fainting, reſolution of the ſpirits, cold ſweat and death follow,</p>
                  <p>The Spleen offended is as the Liver affected, ſave that the ſymptoms are in the right ſide, the other in the left.</p>
                  <p>The Ventricle is demonſtrated to be wounded by the voiding of <hi>chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> frequent vomiting, ſwounding, fainting, and death.</p>
                  <p>When the excrements are retained in the belly, and iſſue out of the wound very unſavoury and putrefied, and hot by the natural place, it is plain that the inteſtines are hurt,</p>
                  <p>The ſign of the Reins or Kidnies wounded, is the ſuppreſſion of urine which cauſeth a ſore pain in the groine and teſticles, with inflation or ſwelling even to death.</p>
                  <p>The accidents of the Bladder offended are one with the reines, unleſſe the ſinewie parts thereof be grieved, and then diſtention of the belly, piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of blood, vomiting, voiding of urine at the wound, ſuppreſſion of the faculties, doting, and death follow.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Spinae Medulla,</hi> or the Marrow of the back bone is hurt, there followeth the reſolution of the ſinewes (which hindereth the function of the ſenſe and motion) voluntary evacuation of excrements appear, and for the moſt part death is the immediate concluſion.</p>
                  <p>The ſolution of a Veine is known by blood of red colour and thick ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>The teſtimony of an Artery hurt, is blood ſomewhat yellow, ſubtie, thin, hot, beating and leaping, or violently iſſuing, and as it were by jumps.</p>
                  <p>The Tendons, Membranes, and Ligaments wounded or inciſed, bring the ſame ſymptomes as the Nerves do.</p>

                     <head>The Cure.</head>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Wherein the cure of wounds in general doth conſiſt.</note> THe Cure of wounds is either by the help of nature or medicine: if by nature, the ſtrife is at an end, the Artiſt may ſave a labour: if
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:37024:74"/>
by medicine their cure conſiſteth both in the reduction of parts diſjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and diſlocated to union, and in conſolidation and true conglutina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them: therefore it ſhall be neceſſary to conſider, that if any thing hinder conſolidation it be removed: that reduct on be rightly and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully wrought, leſt the parts adjoyned fall into relaps, and that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the part with his natural temperament be conſerved: and laſtly, that the ſymptoms be prevented, and carefully cured as they ariſe.</p>
                     <p>The firſt intention in curing of wounds is to take away whatſoever is beſides nature, as Iron, wood, lead, or ought elſe with fit inſtruments, and that without pain (if it may be) to the diſeaſed, that conſolidation may the better be effected. In wounds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the head, to take away the hair, or what elſe might ſeem to hinder the good application of medicines to the grief, is the firſt part. Strive alſo to ſet well the veins and nerves diſplaced, that the beauty and due office of the member be not dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, and that it may conglutinate the eaſier, and being united, keep them ſo by Ligature, future, and other due and artificial means.</p>
                     <p>It is requiſite alſo that the natural temperament of the part be careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſerved: and that is done by a certain carefull regiment of the body, which is univerſal or particular.</p>
                     <p>The univerſal regiment conſiſteth in purging medicines, as Potions, Gliſters, a ſober and frugal dyet, abſtinence from wine, venery, and all kinds of meats which may move or attenuate humours, and moderate uſe of good nouriſhing ſuſtenance, all which helps the poor Sea-man is not capable of in long voyages.</p>
                     <p>The particular Regiment is in remedies which confirm and ſtrengthen the natural heat of the member debilitated, and which hinder and avert fluxion: ſuch are <hi>Unguentum Nutritum diapalma,</hi> I mean <hi>Diacalſithios</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in <hi>Oyl of Roſes, Ceratum Refrigerans, Roſat. Meſſue. Ungu. de minio,</hi> or the like.</p>
                     <p>The general accidents moſt to be feared that affect the wounded are <hi>Haim rrea,</hi> dolour, tumour intemperature, a fever, faintneſſe of the heart, convulſions, ſpecially where a ſinew is wounded.</p>

                        <hi>Haimorrea,</hi> or flux of blood is ſtayed by medicaments aſtringent, fitted and applyed with convenient future or ligature; and ſometimes by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines cauſtik, either actual or potential, touched in the Treatiſe of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation or diſmembring.</p>
                     <p>A Tumour is an unnatural increaſe, exceeding the natural ſtate in the body, and inducing an offence of the actions of the ſame, the cure where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is touched elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>Intemperature is either over much heat or cold, &amp; his remedy is by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſites, as namely, to too hot imtemperature (apply a cold medicament &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The intemperature of the Liver chiefly conſiſteth in oppilation or debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the faculties thereof, and is helped chiefly by wholſome nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: the lamentable want whereof at Sea, is the cauſe of many the grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous obſtructions, and other evil effects in Seamens bodies: ſo that oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a good Artiſt ſhall not be able to heal a mean excoriation.</p>
                     <p>The Accidents common to the wounded heart, as is ſaid, are ſwoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, palpitation thereof, a hot burning fever, and many other.</p>

                     <p>A Fever is a heat in the heart more then natural, infuſed and diſperſed through the whole body, whoſe cure is by purging, bleeding, and good government.</p>
                     <p>A convulſion is a dangerous diſeaſe of the brain, which often-times is a fore-runner or a meſſenger of death.</p>
                     <p>The diſeaſes in the brain are either in the membranes, ſubſtance, or ventricles, and paſſages thereof; whoſe ſpecies and ſymptoms are many, and for the moſt part very dangerous, and of difficult cure: For if the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the brain be offended, the functions thereof are impedited, whence proceedeth doting, melancholly, fooliſhneſſe, ſlothfulneſſe, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargie, frenzie, madneſſe, loſſe of memory, deadiſh ſleep, giddineſſe, apoplexie, Paralyſis, and divers other like accidents formerly recited.

                     <p>Thoſe that are onely in the skin or fleſh have no difficile cure: for oft-times Nature with ſome eaſie remedy, or a Ligature onely doth help them: but thoſe that are compound, offending many parts, need a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical and convenient order of curation, which is divers, as is ſaid, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diverſity of the parts affected: for if contuſion or ruption be onely of the fleſh under the skin, there is required conſolidation by ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie comfortation, and deſiccation; and no ſuppuration, which is effected onely by nouriſhing and preſerving the natural heat or humidity of the member, as in other wounds.</p>
                     <p>But a contuſed wound, if it be be great, requireth purging Gliſters, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or pils, phelbotomie, a wholſome dyet, perfect evacuation of the humour that commeth from the veins, and ſuppuration of the contuſed and livid fleſh; which two laſt, are affected at the firſt by mean remedies; as oyl of roſes and mirtles, &amp; ſometimes by a <hi>Paracelſus</hi> plaiſter.

Let therefore your firſt local application, if you fear putrefaction be <hi>Unguentum Egyptiacum</hi> mixed with Wine or <hi>Sp. Vini,</hi> or alone; being alſo very hot injected into the wound, or applied on lint. And if you fear it will require yet more exſiccation or cauterization, add ſome bumt <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and foment ſomewhat the outward parts of the grief with a hot <hi>Lixivium,</hi> and apply a hot ſtupe wet in the <hi>Lixivium,</hi> and wrung out round about the member: but if the outward parts about the wound be altered in colour, or grow either ſtinking or inſenſible, make ſcarifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and foment well with ſtrong hot <hi>Lixivium,</hi> and inject thereof into the wound very hot; and after ſuch fomentation, ſcarification, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection uſed, as is ſaid, then if you yet ſee cauſe, you may uſe the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer mentioned <hi>Egyptiacum,</hi> with a hot ſtupe, and remove not that dreſſing without extraordinary cauſe, I mean the <hi>Egyptiacum,</hi> in leſſe then 48. hours, but rather, if you have cauſed a good <hi>Esker.</hi> The next dreſſing after the <hi>Esker</hi> procured by the former dreſſing, it is likely you ſhall find digeſtion though imperfect, namely, durty and foul, and the wound will alſo be very tender and ſenſible, and ſubject to alteration by the ayre, if care be not had. Wherefore all things for your next in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of application being firſt ready, ere the wound be opened make a very ſhort dreſſing, and of as gentle medicines as may be. I have uſed an <hi>Arceus Linament</hi> warm, and with ſoft lint applyed, and the edges or parts neer the wound anointed therewith, and gently filled the wound with lint, then over that a <hi>Paracelſus</hi> plaiſter, and moreover a large hot ſtupe wet in a good <hi>Lixivium,</hi> and wrung out, with alſo convenient, ſoft, and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:37024:79"/>
warm Ligature, which is a great help to healing.</p>
                     <p>The third dreſſing, I would leave <hi>Arceus Linament,</hi> and betake me to the <hi>Artificial Balme;</hi> which <hi>Balme</hi> I would apply warm, anointing the parts about therewith; applying alſo thereto ſome good emollient, diſcuſſing, anodine plaiſter; as namely, <hi>Paracelſus</hi> plaiſter I hold chief; next that I hold <hi>Emp. Betonica</hi> deſcribed by <hi>Arceus;</hi> then <hi>Diacalfithios, Minium, Gratia Dei,</hi> or <hi>Mellilote,</hi> any of which, as thy diſcretion and ſtore affords, is proper. The reſt of the Cure I refer to be proceeded in with balm and plaiſters, as is ſaid, in ordinary form: and if any looſe bones be, remove them: onely force none out before their time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great cauſe: if no bones be imagined, ſtrive not to keep the wound open, neither keep any hard tents wirhin the wound open. Many by a cuſtome keep tents to the bo, ome of the grief ſo long, till they make the diſeaſe incurable: you need not be too vigilant in keeping new wounds too long open; for the fear of putrefaction being once put away, and digeſtion procured, and no bones to come out, the ſooner you can heal, the ſafer. Many Surgeons alſo have a groſſe cuſtome of arming tents, as they term it, with precipitated <hi>Mercury,</hi> or other the like Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick medicines, and put them into wounds to mundifie, and alſo the better to digeſt them, as they imagine; but I may boldly affirm, that (as is ſaid) if neither fear of a <hi>Grangrene</hi> be, neither broken bones to be taken out, there is no cauſe of any Cauſtick medicines to applyed for the curing of a new wound at no time. And I find by practice plain, that Cauſtick medicaments within ulcers or fiſtula's have no other uſe but to take away a callous ſubſtance commonly in them, to alter the viciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the humour, and diſpoſe the grief to a good healing; which healing after followeth chiefly by the benefit of nature, together with gentle and ſanative applications, for <hi>(ſubl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

They will not ſee a wound incarn and red, and good fleſh to grow, but ſtraight they ſlander it of pride, and call it proud fleſh, like their own, and then muſt at the faireſt <hi>Precipitate,</hi> or <hi>Vitriolburnt</hi> go to work; yea, though the Patient be lame for it, or at the leaſt the grief put back again.

When you have an intent to bring any tumour to ſuppuration, you muſt neither purge nor bleed your Patient, neither appoint him a thin dyet. When you would an Apoſtume ſhould go back, if it be above the navil in the breaſt, back, or head, then let your purging Medicines be ſuch as purge downward onely, but if it be below the navil, or in the arms, or legs, vomitive Medicines do beſt, except ſome eſpecial hinderances, as <hi>Aſthma</hi> or the like: And to thoſe uſes none are ſo effectual as thoſe which are of <hi>Mercury</hi> truly prepared, for that they do not only duly evacuate, but alſo divert and draw back the humours from the place offended

And further if you intend to repel an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtume you may make uſe of this following Cataplaſme of Bean meal, or wheat meal boyled with water and vinegar a convenient quantity that it be not over ſharp, adding a little Terebinthine and very warm apply it, with alſo good cloſe ligature, and ſhift, renuing the medicine every ſixth or eight hours, but obſerving as it is rehearſed, that to repel an Apoſtume ſlender diet with convenient evacuation of the belly, and Phlebotomy are as principals to be uſed. Alſo a ſafe Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſme to repel an Apoſtume in the beginning is, ℞ <hi>farina fabarum</hi> or Bean flower and caſtle ſope, ana ℥j. wine vineger as much as will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, boyl theſe one quarter of an hour together, and you may mix a little water with the vinegar for fear it break the skin, and apply it warm. Note further, that to an Apoſtume broken by a cauſticke I commonly uſe no other thing then <hi>unguentum baſilicon</hi> warm, from the firſt to the end of the cure, or my artificial balm which I much rather commend upon my long experience, except ſome dreſſings now and then I apply to it onely dry lint, and if nature be not benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to incarn and help healing to my deſire, I uſe a gentle abſterfive medicine, namely a little precipitate mixed with the ſaid <hi>baſilicon</hi> or elſe <hi>unguentum Aegytiacum</hi> very hot, but that only for one dreſſing &amp; one time, and then to my former courſe again for certain daies toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, namely, till the Esker be faln, and at the leaſt three dreſſings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which if it give me not good content in hope of amendment, then I proceed further one degree, namely, I uſe for one dreſſing of <hi>oleum ſulphuris per campanam,</hi> or <hi>oleum Vitrioli,</hi> with which I onely touch the Ulcer within: I alſo give a purge, thereupon if the Patient be ſtrong, and then to my old form again, till nauure be at reſt, I mean as is ſaid, till the Eskar be clean gone, and yet five or ſix daies further: but if then I ſee it be ſtill ſtubborn, I proceed to the next ſtep or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and crave help from my honeſt old friend <hi>Mercury</hi> who if he fail me judiciouſly applied, then I confeſs I am almoſt to ſeek, but he ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom failed me performance, if my Patient were not the cauſe, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe being by Art curable. The mercurial medicine I moſt uſe in ſuch caſes you ſhal find to be rehearſed in the cures of Fiſtulaes and Ulcers.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, therefore entring into due conſideration of the age and ſtrength of the Patient, with other reaſonable reſpects had, give him a doſe of ℈ ij. or <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g> j. of <hi>pulvis Arthreticus,</hi> and 3 daies after of <hi>Aurum vitae</hi> a doſe, viz. grains 8. which he ſhall take whileſt he is yet in bed, and cover him warm, and yet but ordinarily, and it will cauſe him gently to ſweat ſome 2 or 3 houres: then let him wipe himſelf and riſe, and after noon he will feel himſelf very much refreſhed.

But remember this principal rule, that what day he either taketh vomiting, purging, or ſweating medicine, that the ſame day he forbear his dyet drink. Further beware that you pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe not over ſlender diet to him which is already pinched with weak diet, either at Sea or Land: or whoſe diet is of bad nourſhment, as too oftentimes it happeneth amongſt poor Seafaring men in long Voyages.

And for any pockie <hi>Ulcer</hi> on the <hi>virga,</hi> I mean either upon <hi>glans,</hi> or <hi>praputium,</hi> or 'twixt both, only touch it but once with the aforeſaid <hi>Aqus benedicta,</hi> and give the party one doſe of the <hi>Aquilla vitae,</hi> and without queſtion you ſhall cure it afterwards as if it were a green wound, but remember it will cauſe <hi>Virga</hi> to tumifie ſometimes much, but be not afraid, for by the uſe of <hi>Lotions</hi> mixed with Plantane or fair water daily warm, and caſt it in twixt <hi>Glans</hi> and <hi>Praeputium,</hi> it will ſoon amend. It cureth alſo any warts of the <hi>virga</hi> by onely touching them, and that if they be touched but very gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for it is a ſtrong medicine, and procureth ſome pain, but not in warts, yet honeſt it is and ſure, for it will not fail: and if once you acquaint your ſelves with the parts thereof, you will never afterward uſe <hi>Troſſes</hi> of <hi>minium</hi> nor <hi>Mercury</hi> ſublimate again; and yet let me ſpeak my Conſcience, both <hi>Troſſes of minium</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> ſublimate are worthy Medicines, their whole force and healing vertue being indeed onely the quick-ſilver and ſpirits of ſalt, and no other thing, whoſe companion was never found out for healing and killing.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE firſt Intention in the Cure of Fractures is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by reſtoring the bones disjoyned, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away any looſe pieces or fragments of bones if any be.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond Intention is performed by keeping the parts together, namely, the ends of the bones formerly diſplaced and fractured by violence.</p>
                  <p>The third Intention to be done, is the curing of the wounds or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſions incident to fractured bones.</p>
                  <p>The fourth, to prevent or remove the accidents.</p>
                  <p>The firſt part of this work, namely, the reſtoring, or rather bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their places, the fractured ends of the bones, is performed by extention, and a skilfull and ready hand touching the extention: let it be done <hi>paulatim,</hi> by little and little, as the tearm is, with even hands,<note place="margin">The firſt work.</note> not by jumps or on the ſudden, and yet with as much force as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, namely, till the Artiſt ſtanding by with his hands upon the grief, perceive he is able to ſet the ends of the bones into their place; which done, it is then required that they be kept ſo.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond curative intention of Fractures, is performed by keeping the ends of their bones placed in their right forme and place.</p>
                  <p>This part is chiefly done by good Ligature, wherein I am willing to impart to young Artiſts my practiſe in curing Fractures in the thighes and legges, and underſtand I uſe no rowlers at all, but clowts, ſplints armed and tape, my reaſon is, it is a great diſeaſe and diſquiet to my Patient, yea though I have two aſſiſtants to hold the member to come ſo oft about the member as to rowle it, and endangereth much the disjoynting of the bones again, and cauſeth pain.</p>
                  <p>And it is manifeſt that in ſimple Fractures, the placing of the bones and keeping them ſo, is the moſt work of the Cure, and nothing cureth a fractured bone ſo much as reſt: wherefore when a bone is newly placed, and ſhall be troubled much with lifting and rowling, it cannot but hinder unition, and procure ſome accidents offenſive, my form of Ligatures in Fractures is to have next the member one four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double clowt in length, I mean above and below the Fracture, ſo long that the ends of the ſplints I intend to uſe, may have a reſting place on the clowt. And if I intend to cure the Patient by a Lixivium, I apply it on this ſaid clowt, appointing the medicine ever to be next to the grief, then I have another like great cloth to come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that again under the ſplints, which being cloſe and ſmooth
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:37024:85"/>
brought about the member, I then put under the firſt ſplint of a good bredth and length well armed with tow, and under that I lay foure or five ſtrong tapes, then I tie one of the ſaid tapes gently, and thurſt all the reſt of the ſplints under the ſame tape, namely ſo many as may compaſſe the fractured member, lying cloſe, but with ſome ſmall diſtance, that they touch not one another, then I tie the reſt of the tapes, drawing them cloſe, till the partie fenſibly ſeel them to bear in all places, the ſplints I appoint commonly ſo long as the member can bear without galling or troubling the next joynt: theſe things ſo done, if either the legge or thigh be fractured, I appoint him juncks, as ſome terme them, namely bents rowled up in can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſe to come above his knee, and down to the foot, yea, though onely the legge be fractured, it is fit theſe bundles of junckes be as thick, and thicker then the member fractured, for that they may defend it in bed from wrong, and they are gently to be bound to the member, that they may turn with it if occaſion be; to theſe junckes alſo a cloth may be faſtned, which may be brought under the foot to ſtay the ſame up, to his due poſition, which is a great eaſe to the patient, and beleeve me, if once you be but perfect in this form of Ligature, you will never deſire a rowler in the Cure of fracture: I uſed rowlers till I ſaw the fufficiency of this form of binding, which now I deſire not to change.</p>

                     <p>FIrſt the Diſeaſe comes, as is ſaid, by obſtructions of the ſpleen, and by the thickneſſe of the humour, not the multitude.</p>
                     <p>Some judicious Writers do affirm this ſickneſſe to come by the multitude of Melancholike humors gathered in <hi>Vena Porta,</hi> by which it is ſaid the Milt doth draw unto it Melancholly humors, and ſo tranſporteth it from the Milt into the Ventricle.</p>
                     <p>But truly the cauſes of this diſeaſe are ſo infinite and unſearchable, as they far paſs my capacity to ſearch them all out; ſome men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this diſeaſe happeneth to Sea-men onely, through long being at Sea without touch at land, as it is ſeen in Eaſt India voyages; our men have it betwixt <hi>England,</hi> and the Cape <hi>de bon ſpera<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The chief cauſe whereof is the continuance of ſalt diet, either fiſh or fleſh, as pork and the like, which is not to be avoided at ſea, as I ſuppoſe by the wit of man; another cauſe is want of ſufficient nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing food, and of ſweet water, and alſo for want of <hi>Aqua vita,</hi> wine, beer, or other good water to comfort and warm their ſtomackes, which by contrary winds men are two much incident unto in long voiages, howſoever the Marchants are careful, provident, and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in that point.</p>

An other cauſe of this diſeaſe to the ordinary ſort of poor men, is want of freſh apparel to ſhift them with, which indeed amongſt poor Sailers, eſpecially a ſort of them that are careleſſe and lazy of diſpoſition is too frequent, partly alſo by the not keeping their appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel ſweet and dry, and the not cleanſing and keeping their Cabins ſweet, this alſo ingendreth and increaſeth the infection. Some charge Bisket as a cauſe of the Scurvy, but I am not of their opinion: Some ſay inordinate watchings are cauſe therſeof: Some ſay extream labour wanting due nouriſhment: Some alſo affirm cares and grief to be ſome cauſe thereof, others affirm the very heat of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <p>But it is plain that this grief is a lazie foul diſeaſe with obſtructions of the liver, or ſpleen, or of both; as alſo it appeareth that the head is much diſeaſed, and that there is great obſtructions in the brain, for that the eyes not onely look evil coloured, but alſo the gummes pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trifie, and the teeth grow looſe, and all the ſinewy parts of the body bear their part in the diſeaſe, for the ſhrinking and withering of the ſinews with the great pains the party hath, declareth no leſſe.</p>

And whereas the firſt part of this Cure is in the opening of obſtructions, it is therefore fit in the beginning of the grief to give a lenitive glyſter, then the next day if the party be ſtrong open a vein, but beware, as is ſaid, of taking too much blood away at once, eſpecially where the Liver is weak or ſtopped, and where men want good nutriment, for many evils enſue thereby. The next day following his bleeding if he can bear it, and if that his diſeaſe be with a ſwelling or fulneſſe, give him a doſs of the pills of Euphorbium or otherwiſe of pibula ruffi, or of Cambogia, and make him ſome comfortable ſpoon meat, ſuch as you can make at ſea; namely, an Oatmeal caudle would not be amiſs of a little beer or wine, with the yolk of an egge, and a little Sugar made warm and given him to drink, or any comfortable broth made with Currants and other fruit, or Spices moderately taken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or with Sugar, or as the Ship can afford, a Barley water for his ordinary drink were not amiſs, with ſome few drops of Cinnamon water therein, and alſo ſome juice or Syrupe of Lemons therein, or a few drops of oyl of Vitriol, and ſome Sugar, and give him in his drink by way of infuſion, dryed Wormwood good ſtore, for it is very wholeſome.</p>

Alſo if you take a little thereof at night it is good to mixe therewith ſome ſugar, or to take of the ſyrup thereof is not amiſſe.

                     <p>The principall Laxative medicine which I would adviſe in this caſe is pills of <hi>Euphorbium</hi> wherewith the body being ſwoln and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, you may at your pleaſure make evacuation thereof: theſe purge alſo by urine very well the doſſe being <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>

Alſo <hi>Aquilla</hi> Laxative is a very good purge in this caſe, namely eight or ten grains thereof taken in a cup of wine. It cureth alſo all worms of the body, and killeth them whereſoever they be. But if the ſtomack onely be oppreſſed with the grief in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, I firſt give a doſe of pills called <hi>Pillule Ruffi,</hi> namely <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>j. you ſhall find them to be very good.</p>
                     <p>Note further, that if any doſe or any whole maſſe of pills in the Cheſt, ſuch time as you would adminiſter them be grown too hard, then you may diſſolve them with any ſyrup you have, or with good honey a very little, namely one onely drop will ſerve to diſſolve one<note place="margin">How to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them in a fit conſiſtence if they be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoft.</note> doſe at once, if the maſſe prove too liquid, you may roll it in ſome of the <hi>Pulvis Arthreticus</hi> till it be hard enough.

                     <p>Furthermore, if you ſee cauſe, certain dayes after you have given of any your former Laxatives, you may give a ſweat to the patient in his<note place="margin">To ſweat is an other ſingular remedie.

In all fluxes of the belly, whether they proceed of ſharp or ſlipperie humours, or whatſoever elſe offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſe taken with maſtick, <hi>Terra Sigillata,</hi> fine Bole, or with any other appropriate good medicine, it is exceeding ſure, for it fortifieth the other medicines, and doubleth their forces, adding his own alſo thereto. In extream watchings and want of reſt, either inwardly or outwardly taken, it is profitable if outwardly you would uſe it, take foure or ſix grains, with three drops of oyl of Nutmeggs, which is preſſed out mixed together, and binde it in two little clouts, and put it into the noſtrils, it will marvellouſly aſſwage pains in the head, and cauſe quiet reſt. In the extream bleedings of the noſe called He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moragie, it is an approved ſecret, that ſixteen grains thereof divided into two pils, and thruſt up into the noſtrils, into each noſtril one part, helpeth the ſame. In all kinds of Fevers it is good to be given with water of Worm-wood, or pill-wiſe alone, and if the heat remain af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſixe houres, you may give it the ſecond time, and after that again in like time ſafely, not exceeding the doſe: yet let your own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence lead you, that where you ſee three grains will not cauſe reſt, in the next potion you give one grain more, and ſo increaſe paulatim, but increaſe not but upon good deliberation.</p>
                     <p>In burning Fevers it aſſwageth thirſt, and provoketh ſleep chiefly in thoſe Fevers, in which the partie ſeemeth to have ſome ſhew of reſt, with tedious dreams and ſlumbrings mixed.</p>
                     <p>In the diſeaſe called Aſthma, and in the Tyſick, if it be uſed in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Hyſſope, it will preſerve the diſeaſed Patient a long time.</p>
                     <p>It conſerveth the natural heat, ſtrengthneth the ſpirits, repaireth ſtrength loſt: It is alſo effectual to be given to melancholy people which are void of reaſon, and are troubled with the paſſions of the heart. It is likewiſe uſed with good effect againſt vomiting, and the Hickcock proceeding of wind, faintneſſe, or debilitie of the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle.</p>
                     <p>In the ſuperfluous defluxions of the excremental or menſtrual bloud, it is an excellent remedy with <hi>Crocus Martis,</hi> or red coral.</p>
                     <p>In phrenſies and madneſſe, both in wardly and outwardly it is good mixed with <hi>Aqua vitae,</hi> and the temples anointed therewith.</p>
                     <p>In the falling ſickneſſe with ſpirit of Vitriol, or the quinteſſence of Camphire, with alſo oyle of Almonds, it is uſually taken. The doſe of this opiate medicine, is two, or three, or foure grains, if there be looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the belly, as is rehearſed, it worketh much the better. Note
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:37024:105"/>
that in ſome parts of the world this medicine in the mentioned doſe will doe no eaſe, wherefore when you finde that by experience, in the next Patient give more, but not to the ſame Patient without great reaſon. It is beſt given in any occaſion accompanied with waters or<note place="margin">The beſt way to adminiſter it.</note> other medicines which are moſt appropriate to the diſeaſes, land parts diſeaſed, and yet may very well be given alone in a pill, which I willingly do, for that the Patient then is leaſt troubled with the taſte thereof.</p>

                     <p>Thus much in briefe for explaining the three principal kinds of Salts, each of which have a three-fold ſeveral ſubſtance contained in them, viz. <hi>A volatile</hi> ſalt, a fixed ſalt, and a <hi>Caput mortuum,</hi> named alſo <hi>Terra Damnata,</hi> otherwiſe it may be tearmed to containe a Flegme, a ſpirit, an oyle which againe is called, <hi>Sal, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> each dividable plainly and eaſily by Art: Some may here object, that they will draw more then three ſubſtances, each being a good medicine from any one ſubject, either Animal, Vegetable or Mineral, as for an inſtance from <hi>Mercury,</hi> you may extract infinite ſeveral medicines, inwardly, and outwardly ſerviceable, as namely you may have from <hi>Mercury</hi> Laxative, Vomitive, Diaphoretick Diaureticke, cordial, preſervative, and ſundry other needful medicines to be miniſtred with great ſafety and comfort to the diſeaſed, as elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where of <hi>Mercury</hi> is noted: which ſpeech may ſeeme very ſtrange to<note place="margin">Anſwer.</note> ſome that all theſe, yea and many more varieties and diverſities are found in any one Mineral: but though one ſubſtance make many medicines, yet it confoundeth nothing the <hi>tria principia,</hi> for every medicine is not one principal, neither is there any principal tied to<note place="margin">Salts good in meats, are of three ſorts.</note> to make but one medicine.

What is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the ſuperiour Globe. What the inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</note> divided into two Globes, to wit, into the ſuperiour Heaven, which is Aetheriall and Aery, and into the inferiour Globe which containeth the Water, and the Earth. The ſuperiour Globe which is Aetheriall, hath in it fire, lightning, and brightneſſe, and this fiery Heaven is one formall and eſſentiall Element; the water and earth are the other two Elements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo he concludes, there is but three, and with him all the Chymiſts of latter times ſubſcribe, affirming that number moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect which agreeth with the everlaſting Trinitie.</p>

Therefore are the heavens the fourth Element, yea and the firſt, for the ſacred Word ſheweth us that in the beginning God made Heaven and Earth, ſhewing that Heaven was the firſt made, and in the outward heavens are included the water and earth, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaith <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſus,</hi> may be compared to wine contained in a veſſel, for wine is not gathered and prepared without a veſſel firſt had and ready, proving alſo many wayes that the fire is included within the Element of Aire, and is no Element of it ſelf. To prove the like opinion, touching the foure Elements, I could rehearſe the names of many famous Writers if I had leiſure, and that the occaſion were worth it, but the queſtion little concerneth the cure of diſeaſes by young Chirurgions, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will conclude this point my ſelf, intending neither to quarrel for to prove three, nor four, let there be four or three, either of both ſhall contentme.</p>

Hiera Hermetis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The Art of it ſelf is alſo called <hi>Ars Hermetis,</hi> and for the tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of metals that is alſo underſtood with <hi>Gebreus Mauritanus</hi> to have proceeded from <hi>Hermes,</hi> the which in this work the Author in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends not at all to handle, but onely of the inventers of this Art: ſome writers ſay, the Arabians, and others the Perſians, are thought to be

the firſt that have prepared metals fit for medicines, and alſo have practiſed the diſtlling of Liquors: whence <hi>Avicen</hi> of <hi>Sanſano</hi> is ſaid to have ſtudied Alchymie, and he maketh mention of Sublimation and precipitation. Alſo many other Princes and Philoſophers moved thereunto no doubt <hi>de preſcientia Dei,</hi> eſteemed themſelves exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly graced by the works they performed in that Art for the curing of many infirmities.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt which one of the moſt famous and ſo moſt truly worthy was that excellent Philoſopher for art and experience <hi>Philippus Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraſtus Bombast,</hi> otherwiſe named <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> who deſcended from a princely family in high Germany, in the countrey or Province of Helvetia commonly called Switherland; upon whoſe monument, to his perpetual fame is ingraven the verſes following.

And whoſe engraven Motto was:
<q>Alterius non ſit qui ſuus eſſe poteſt.</q>
And <hi>Bazillius Valentinus</hi> ſeconded him, who having his lights from the former exceedingly beautified the Chymick Art, by compoſing medicines of unſpeakable worth to future ages, far exceeding their worthy predeceſſors as is manifeſt; for what compariſon can there be betwixt medicines made of vegetables, decocted, contunded or mixed how artificial ſoever, if compared with Elixers, Quinteſſences, Tinctors, and like extracts of price, which are not onely dureable for many yeers without change, eaſie and pleaſant to be received into mans body in his greateſt weakneſſe, but alſo they excel all Galeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical compoſitions for the eradicating inveterate maladies, as expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience more then ſufficiently manifeſteth. For example, ſuppoſe a ſweat provoking medicine were to be uſed of four, ſix, or eight grains, being a Diaphoretick of gold, or ſuppoſe but of <hi>Sulphur</hi> in or with a fitting vehicle given, as, namely, in a little Mithridate, Conſerve of Roſes, that by cauſing a gentle ſweat would extinguiſh a peſtilential fever: were it not far eaſier for the ſick to receive into his body then a decoction made of ſudorifick herbs, as <hi>Carduus An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelica,</hi> or Centaury with Mithridate and ſyrups juſtly compoſed, as in that form is uſual, or that an Extract being a <hi>Catholicon purgans</hi> ten or fifteen grains whereof being extracted from a vegetable, which without any offenſive nauſeous taſte, or bitterneſſe at all, doth work effectually to the deſire of the Artiſt, ſuppoſe you it ſhall not be as much to the reputation of the Artiſt, and to the content and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the patient, as if he had taken a doſe of Diaphenicon, or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio Hamech,</hi> with the uſual additaments of decoctions or ſyrups thereunto as vehicles added.</p>
                     <p>Or that a doſe of a <hi>Panchiagagon</hi> of 20. grains be not far more grateful to a ſick ſtomack, then an ounce of <hi>Diacatholicon de ſucc. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarum,</hi>

                        <hi>Confectio Hamech,</hi> or the like, it being daily manifeſt that the very ſight of large doſes of medicines, although good, are nauſeous, and abhorred of the weak ſtomack, yea that many Patients will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the diſeaſe rather then the medicine; whereas on the contrary true prepared Chymick medicines are not onely grateful to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the body, but alſo, as is ſaid, far excel the others in vertue and potent operation: and whereas the Chirurgion cannot at all times adviſe with the learned Phyſician, as fitting and moſt requiſite he ſhould in caſes of Phyſick, where ſuch may be had for the health of his patient, as namely, the Chirurgion being at Sea, and upon long Voiages, or at land in the Camp or Countrey, where learned advice cannot readily be had, they have eſpecial reaſon if they be men provident to be furniſhed with ſuch medicines as are ſmall of doſe, and light of portage, being alſo ſuch as do not putrifie, nor in one year change their accuſtomed natures and vertues, no nor in any Voiage how long ſoever: all which Chymick medicaments do well perform, yea though they be carried in ſhips and paſſe the line more then once.</p>
                     <p>Whereas few medicines made of Vegetables that are in common practiſe, though ſound from the Apothecaries ſhops, will be found ſerviceable upon juſt occaſion if they go but a ſix monethes voyage, as daily experience ſheweth, and as the Reader may eaſily conceive: wherefore then how needful, precious, and how truly valuable ſuch medicines be, let any indifferent perſon judge, that being truly made, duely adminiſtred, and their doſes and uſes obſerved and known.</p>

And in this place conſidering that <hi>Mercury</hi> is appointed and appropriated, as formerly is expreſſed, to the cure of the diſeaſes of the Liver.

In which attributes of <hi>Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie,</hi> as aforeſaid, to the healing of the Liver, it ſeems to me <hi>Mercury</hi> is as it were by God and Natures appointment prefigured and enjoyned for the healing of the fooliſh young man that had the dart ſtrucken through his Liver; for I am confident that dart was by <hi>Solomon</hi> meant the contagious diſeaſe of the French pox, which by <hi>coitu vel contact<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For in the perfect cure whereof, the Liver is firſt to be rectified, for the which work I had almoſt ſaid <hi>Mercury</hi> is beyond compariſon, if he be well guided by the experienced artiſt: But if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, <hi>Mercury</hi> is a Dragon, who for healing and killing hath no fellow, as I formerly have denoted more then once.

and yet of theſe but very few, but become or ſeemed for a moneth or two, to have been well cured of their diſeaſes, and yet after a ſmall time they languiſhed away and dyed, ſome of Conſumptions, others of more fearful accidents by that moſt peſtiferous Indian Rat, be it for <hi>Sal, Sulphur,</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> unduly prepared.</p>
                     <p>And <hi>Cardanus,</hi> an ancient worthy Writer, reporteth of a woman ſometime his Patient, who dying of a vehement pain in her head, after the receiving of divers Mercurial medicines, which being dead; himſelf took out ℥ij. of crude Mercury, from within her ſcull.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Oving Brethren, for as much as in times of war, as well as of peace, men of our calling ſhould be ready <hi>Ad omne quare,</hi> for the ſervice of their King and Countrey: We and our Countrey have been long happy in a bleſſed peace; and yet even now having rumors of warre, it is not amiſſe to be prepared for the contrary: Wherefore from the wiſe heathen Philoſopher, let us all learn as followeth <hi>(Jam tua res agitur, para cum proximus ardet:)</hi> Our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Nations are and have been long in combuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; it is therefore wiſedome for us to be ready, and the rather we ought to take it into our better conſideration, becauſe at the firſt compoſing and writing hereof, namely in Iuly, 1626. when as I publiſhed it, there were then, and now are rumours of Warres, and our Company of Barber Surgeons were then commanded by His Majeſties Authoritie forthwith to provide ſixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of the beſt Surgeons as the then time afforded for his eſpecial ſervice by Land, ſuch as were men moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in the healing of wounds made with Gunne-ſhot; and generally for the moſt part, by reaſon of that long and happy peace that our Nation had enioyed, many good Surgeons being put to it at the firſt, were likely to have been found ſomewhat to ſeek therein; how much more then our younger men? wherefore the charge of providing, preparing, and fitting His Maieſties whole ſervice by land and ſea, being by his Highneſs referred to our Corporation &amp; our Company, having for that time made choice of my ſelfe, and deputed me to the worke, I held my ſelfe in conſcience and dutie tied to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what,
<pb facs="tcp:37024:150"/>
although I confes it was little, to the better ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and encouraging of younger men unto their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in that point. But here under favour I muſt deſire pardon for a little digreſſion; namely, that before my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance unto any further diſcourſe, I acquaint the yonger ſort of Surgeons my Brethren with thoſe eſpecial fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, which it then pleaſed our moſt gracious King Charles, to beſtow upon our Corporation in particular above and beyond his ever bleſſed Anceſtors, for the good of his Souldiers and Sea-men, and our encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thereby, to animate and inable us the more heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to ſerve him: And namely.</p>
                  <p>Firſt his Highneſs was graciouſly pleaſed, when alſo he increaſed the ſea-mens wages, to augment the month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wages of each Surgeon and Surgeons Mate in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice by ſea and land, to above a third penny from former cuſtom; namely from nineteen ſhillings four pence a moneth to thirty ſhillings. He hath alſo bin graciouſly pleaſed to give a free benevolence to the Surgeons in all his ſea ſervices, which never was given them by any of the former Kings nor Queens of this land before as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, <hi>viz.</hi> To all Surgions that ſerve in his Highneſs own ſhips, I mean towards the furniſhing of their Surgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Cheſts with Phyſical drugs and medicaments, I ſay for each of them ten pounds; and to each Merchants ſhip five pounds, and to each Newcaſtle-ſhip or Colliarsſhip ſerving in his Highneſs his affairs three pounds. And, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs all the Surgions in his Highneſs ſervice have as formerly by the head of all men that are in pay in any of his ſhips or land-ſervice two pence of each man by the moneth: And for the ſurgeons in his Land ſervice, he alloweth to the Surgeon Major of the whole Camp five ſhillings a day; and for his two Mates or ſervants four ſhillings a day. Alſo his Majeſtie alloweth to each Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion two ſhillings and ſix pence the day, which is three pounds and fifteen ſhillings the moneth, and to each Mate three pound a moneth, and more over allowed, and gave to each Surgeon appointed to 250. men, a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery
<pb facs="tcp:37024:150"/>
Cheſt of 17. pounds valew free of account: And moreover his Majeſtie alloweth to the Surgeon Major a ſtore Cheſt or Magazeen Cheſt of 48. pounds value, for a ſupply to furniſh upon all wants and occaſions: And His Highneſs was yet further well pleaſed to give autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity unto the Maſters and Governors of our Society, for to have the making, compounding, fitting, and ordering of all the medicines, as well Phyſicall as Chirurgicall, together with all other proviſions belonging to the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons cheſt. And further His Highneſs hath referred to the ancient Maſters and the Governours of our Society, the preſſing of all Surgeons and Surgeons Mates or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to Surgeons and Barbers; with alſo the taking up of any inſtruments, cheſts, or ready made medicines in His Highneſs name for his ſervice, if occaſion be not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. Theſe favours and priviledges our Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on have received from His Highneſs, together with a new Charter, wherein he hath likewiſe gratiouſly been pleaſed to confirm all our priviledges formerly granted unto us; and hath given us divers new priviledges for the better ſubſiſtance of our ſaid Corporation in future times; as alſo we had never been denied as formerly, to have monies impreſted before hand, for the providing a cheſt with ſurgery Inſtruments and ſalves. In regard whereof, and for that Surgeons ſhould with the better courage be inſtigated faithfully to perform their duties; I have preſumed in this Preface to explain His Highneſs former favors, as aforeſaid, whereby our younger bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theren may from age to age the better keep it in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; and to that end I have alſo further under favor I hope without offence, preſumed to ſet down the effect of the order of the then Lords of his Highneſs moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Privie Councell, with the day and yeare in which ſome of the recited priviledges were granted and ordered, as alſo in part the form and order how his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties Officers of his Navie have interpreted, diſpenſed, and diſpoſed of his Maieſties ſaid free gift, according to the ſeverall burthens, rankes and orders of the ſhips of His Highneſs his Navy reſpectively, which are as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth.</p>

                  <p>The day of the grants of the aforeſaid order touching benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, was to my beſt remembrance the 10 of <hi>July,</hi> 1626. at <hi>White-hall,</hi> by the Lords of h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And further the ſaid Honourable Lords were then pleaſed to order, that all ſuch other monies as uſually had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by way of impreſt to any Surgeons in His Majeſties ſervice, towards the providing and further fitting of their Surgery-Cheſts, ſhould together with the former monies be likewiſe paid into the hands of the ſaid Maſters and Wardens, ever for the time being in dew time and before hand; who for the better effecting of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents and ſervice aforeſaid, were ordered to ſee the ſaid monies faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and frugally beſtowed, and ſhould for the ſurer performance of it, orderly have the making, ordering, fitting, and compounding of all the medicines, as well phyſical as chirurgical; as alſo all other proviſions belonging to a Surgeons Cheſt; or to appoint ſuch others for the effecting the work, as they ſhould at their perils anſwer for their faithful performances: All which Cheſts and proviſions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever therein ſo fitted and provided as aforeſaid, being ready, the Maſter and Wardens are by the ſaid order commanded to ſee every of them to be ſafely delivered under lock and key, unto His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties officers whom it may concern at <hi>Tower-wharfe;</hi> that all things therein provided and incloſed might the ſafelier come on board the ſhips, for which they are deſigned: All which allowances, Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Priviledges and Commands, were then by the ſaid moſt Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Lords thought fit to be for ever hereafter continued to all ſhips or Fleets in his Highneſſe future ſervices, as is more plainly manifeſt by the ſaid order; the which no doubt is extant, and unto which if occaſion require, relation may be had.</p>
                  <p>Thus loving Brethren, having acquainted you with theſe his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties favours unto our Corporation, it followeth in my duty that I ſhould acquaint the younger ſort of Surgeons with the uſe of the Surgeons Cheſt, I mean the medicines in this <hi>Viaticum</hi> contained; in ſome methodical manner, according to the inſuing expreſſions of the following Treatiſe, were it not that time haſtens me to an end, before <hi>I</hi> begin: Yet nevertheleſſe I have ſhrained of time to lend the yonger ſort a word or two in this <hi>Viaticum,</hi> not to al as a Teacher, but as a loving remembrance to the elder, which I pray you to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſe as you have occaſion.

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Gun-ſhot wounds over compound.</note> No wound of Gun-ſhot can be ſaid to be a ſimple wound, neither ever was there any Artiſt, that could truely ſay, that he healed any gun-ſhot wound by the firſt intention of Vnition, without due ſuppu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, no nor any contuſed wound whatſoever; for the compoſition of Gun-ſhot wounds, are ever real and very ſubſtantial; witneſſe the poore patient, where Fibres, Nerves, Membranes, Veines, Arteries, Bones, &amp; <hi>quid non,</hi> ſuffer together ſo, that ſuch wounds, in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency they reſemble Vlcers rather then wounds; and the differences of theſe from other contuſed wounds is, That other contuſed<note place="margin">Difference of contuſed wounds.</note> Wounds for the moſt part ſuffer but by way of contuſion onely, and theſe by contuſion and dilaceration, if not fraction of bones &amp;c. whereby all the whole member ſuffereth together, and alſo the parts adjacent, and that in a high degree.</p>
                  <p>If diſcolouring bliſtering or other apparent ſhewes of a <hi>Gangrena</hi> appeare, give the patient a Diaphoreticke cordial, then ſcarify gently at the firſt, and deeply afterwards as cauſe ſhall urge, and have ready a <hi>Lixivium</hi> made of water and aſhes, to the height of an ordinary Lee that women uſe to drive bucks with, and put a reaſonable quantity of common Salt into it, and when it is cleared, if you have hearbs, as

                  <p>Obſerve in great lacerated wounds, as followeth, viz. If you find by the wound, the one halfe of the member to be taken away, there is no hope to ſave on the reſt, but you are rather to make preſent Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation,<note place="margin">Iuſt cauſe of amputation.</note> eſpecially if the patient upon information of his danger be willing, for that the reſt is contuſed, and muſt therefore admit by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent, ſome loſſe of ſubſtance, by ſuppuration ever in a contuſed wound, and then the remaining part can doe no ſervice to the body but will much indanger the life of the patient, by the expence of blood and ſpirits in the ſtriving to ſave it, and be but a hindrance: and I dare ſay, that if but halfe any member be taken away, with the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the bone, it is impoſſible to ſave the reſt of it on, to do any ſervice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If you have haemorrage, I mean bleeding, or furtive bleeding, or weeping of veines or arteries, in your worke, ſearch for the vein or artery that bleedeth or gleeteth; and try if you can make ligature on it, if you cannot, make ligature, which ſeldome or never you can in Gunſhot wounds, then apply to the end of the veine that weepeth an actual cautery, a ſmall one will ſerve, but apply it like it ſelfe very hot, and apply it not all over the wound, onely to that veine, if you can, that bleedeth, you may if the flux be not great, uſe burning hot <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiacum,</hi> upon a button of lint dipt, and quickly and neatly brought to the place, whilſt it is hot, and then well boulſtred.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Actual Cautery.</note> But a ſmall actual cautery is the ſafer, and maketh better worke, or the Surgeon may uſe reſtrictive powder, adding thereto burnt Vitriol<note place="margin">Reſtrictive Powder.</note> a little or burnt allum, and precipitate mixed which maketh a ſtrong eſkar, and often reſtraineth a great Flux, being applied thereon arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficially, onely precipitate will ſurely make bones ſoul in contuſed wounds, for which cauſe I affect it not.</p>

                     <note place="margin">To take heed of an old error.</note> But ever take heed to avoid the old received error of unwiſe practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, whoſe uſe is to cram the wounds, be they inciſed wounds or contuſed wounds, as is ſaid, ful of bole or reſtringent powder, or ſome other ſtuffe, and then thruſt in pledgents or dorſels into each corner of the wound, yea ſometimes forgetting to take all out at the next dreſſing, yet think they have done all workman like, and very artificial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not conſidering the harm, that often enſueth thereby. I dare ſay, that in contuſed wounds of Gunſhot, by ſuch errors, they force and draw a <hi>Gangrena,</hi> if not death thereby, by hindering natural unition, by obſtructing the parts, and grieving the patient, in keeping the wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded parts from healing. It is a ſafe and fair way at the firſt dreſſing, ever to ſtrive to joyn together the parts of all recent wounds, and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite the wounded parts if it may be with this caution, to order that fit

breathing be left to evacuate the peccant humours, whereof there is ſmall feare in lacerated wounds, and then to apply apt and fitting aſtringent medicaments outwardly over all, together with apt and due ligature; and by that courſe to ſtay a fluxe, but in contuſed and lacerated wounds of Gunſhot, the Surgion hath not that benefit, but muſt truſt to other helps not ſo ready, namely, as is ſaid in the leſſer wounds, to very warme Balmes, aſtringent defenſatives, and good li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature, and in greater wounds, to cauſtick medicaments, Cauteries and forcible helps to repel fluxes, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But in the Surgeon his careful deſire to reſtraine fluxes, let him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<note place="margin">A Caveat.</note> beware of over hard ligature, as much as is poſſible, which is alſo a common dangerous error, and certainely draweth on evill acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, as <hi>Plegmon Gangrena, &amp;c.</hi> as daily experience telleth.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe one the other ſide, over-ſlack binding is alſo bad, due, comly and ſmooth ligature, with the due compoſing the parts woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with ſoft and ſmooth boulſtring, greatly honoreth the Artiſt and cureth the patient almoſt as much as the medicines doe.</p>
                  <p>Obſerve alſo, that you put never one Cauſtick or Eſcarotick me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine after another too ſoone, namely, not until the firſt eskarre hath beene gone at the leaſt three daies. If in a contuſed wound of Gunſhot any ſlough or putrid part, as proceeding from the heads of the muſkets, arteries, veines, or the like, appeare in a contuſed wound which needeth an Eſcaroticke medicine, and the Surgeon doe deſire to cleanſe that part, let him uſe an artificial Cauſtick medicine, namely, hot <hi>Egyptiacum,</hi> or an actual Cautery, if you can apply it onely in that place, and not all over the wound, for in truth the uſe of them is very good in contuſed wounds made by Gunſhot; and yet<note place="margin">Over drying me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</note> you are to conſider, that as too much gleeting, weeping or experience of humidity from wounds of gunſhot is dangerous many wayes, ſo too much uſe of drying medicaments in wounds made with Gunſhot, is no leſſe dangerous by ſtopping the pores and repelling the peccant humours, by reaſon of the contuſed blood collected, being choaked in the wound, aptly indangering a Gangrena, and other deadly acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents incident thereunto.</p>

                     <p>And when you would uſe it for a defenſative, take of this powder, about halfe an ounce of <hi>Poſca,</hi> I meane water and Vinegar mixed, foure ounces, put the powder therein which will almoſt melt, then dip clouts therein, and apply them. This medicine with moderation uſed, is a true and excellent defenſative, and a very anodine.</p>
                     <p>Alſo it healeth all itchings, ſmartings, gaulings, or any <hi>Eriſipelas</hi> or other excoriations ſpeedily and ſafely, and dryeth it mightily, preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth from accidents, either in great wounds, or fractures and being in ſmall quantity uſed with faire water to ulcers, it cleanſeth them well and healeth them.</p>
                     <p>And if you have whites of egges, mixed with a <hi>Poſca,</hi> it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were the better, or in fractures with yolkes and whites together it is very good, onely let the care of the Surgeon be, that he apply it in his true nature, namely as a defenſative in fit time and touching the reſt of the uſes thereof, he may preſume he hath a very good Medicine, and ſo for this time I take my leave.</p>

                  <head>A Deſcription of the <hi>Trafine,</hi> and the neceſſary uſes thereof, eſpecially for Military occaſions for young Surgeons.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving had ſufficient tryals of the facility and of the <hi>Trafine,</hi> I have thought fit to commend it and the uſe thereof, for the future, to the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Artiſt, upon ſome of their requeſts, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting ought from the worthineſſe, and due commendations of the Author of the <hi>Trapan,</hi> concerning that excellent invention, yet by way of addition to my former Edition, I thought fit here to deſcribe the <hi>Trafine,</hi> it being an Inſtrument of my own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, which experience will ſhew, is more compendious, and of more facility in the uſe thereof, for young practicioners in Surgery then is the <hi>Trapan,</hi> the which Inſtrument, although it may be ſaid to be derivative or Epitomy of or from the <hi>Trapan;</hi> yet well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, it performeth as much as the <hi>Trapan</hi> in every degree and more, and for that it was ſo faſhioned, and firſt practiſed by my ſelfe, I thought fit to put the name of a <hi>Trafine</hi> upon it <hi>(a tribus finibus)</hi> from the three ends thereof, each being of ſeveral uſes, and being as it may appeare triangular or three cornered, each corner there of performing the part it ſeemeth to undertake, ſo that it fully ſupplyeth and maketh good all the uſes of a <hi>Trapan,</hi> with the one end, and that with more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility as is ſaid, and ſafely then the <hi>Trapan</hi> doth, or can doe, and it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth with the ſecond end all the uſes of a ſmooth Levatory, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth the neceſſity of a Jagged or toothed Levatory, with the third end, the ſaid Levatories being all neceſſary adjutors in helping to make and finiſh the <hi>Trafine</hi> or <hi>(tres finis</hi> (and who ſo ſhall pleaſe to make a judicial experience thereof, not being prejudicated, will find that it far exceedeth the <hi>Trapan</hi> in all his uſes; in the compendious and ſafe performance of the workes, as well of the two Levatories, as of a <hi>Trapan</hi> recited which the former can no way be ſaid to be.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the <hi>Trapan</hi> cannot be well managed without both the hands of the Artiſt <hi>viz.</hi> the one for the work of eroſion by the Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial motion thereof in turning it ever round for the better penetrating of the <hi>Cranium,</hi> the other hand muſt be uſed to keep it ſteddy upon the affected part, and yet the upper part of the Inſtrument, muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe, as of neceſſity reſt upon the Surgeons breſt, yea and the Surgeon muſt for that purpoſe order his body in a fit poſture; and further yet, the Surgeon muſt have a ſecond man for an aſſiſtant of neceſſity, that muſt be imployed to ſtay the Patients head, whereas
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:37024:161"/>
with this Inſtrument (I meane the <hi>Trafine)</hi> the whole worke is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the two hands of the Surgeon onely, with farre more dexterity and quicker, then with the <hi>Trapan</hi> as is ſaid, yea, and that with much more comfort, both to the patient and to the Artiſt, as the practice therewith will plainely ſhew: and againe, there is no ſuch danger attending that Inſtrumentas doth the <hi>Trapan;</hi> for the heads of the <hi>Trafine</hi> are made all taper, to wit, wider above then beneath, and alſo cut both wayes, and cannot therefore eaſily be ſaid to offend the <hi>(Dura Mater)</hi> by an error to be ſuggeſted, to happen in the uſe thereof, without ſtupid ignorance in the Artiſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Trapan</hi> of old had ever the heads as wide above as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, which heads were many wayes both very dangerous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, eſpecially when the Inſtrument by turning round, had cleane pierced through the <hi>Cranium,</hi> and thereby after the ſame head had fully perforated the <hi>Cranium</hi> round, it was very apt on the ſuddaine to ſlip downe upon the <hi>(Dura Mater)</hi> by error and improvidence of the Artiſt, either upon oblivion or omiſſion divers wayes, as namely for one, if the Artiſt did not truly, equally, and ſtrongly faſten the ſmall ſcrew, being an iron or rather a ſteele pin, that ſtayeth and faſteneth the ſaid head of the <hi>Trapan,</hi> which the Artiſt pierceth with for the gaging thereof, either by haſt, which though otherwiſe he might adjudged a careful Surgeon, yet upon his eager proceeding on his work, might unhappily be omitted, and even that ſmall error might cauſe danger to the life of the Patient, and ſometimes proved the irrecoverable cauſe of his death; whereas this Inſtrument, the <hi>Trafine,</hi> hath all the heads thereof made taper, as is ſaid, namely wider above then below, piercing every way alike, and therefore there needeth no rule or gager, eſpecially in the being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without turning it round about, but is done by the onely mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving or agitating of the hand to and fro, yea with the onely moving of the wriſt of the hand, and which is another manifeſt benefit thereof, it can goe no lower then it is, by agitating and extreame preſſing urged, and when it hath penetrated through it, for the moſt part de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth and bringeth forth the peece of the bone with it, and putteth the Patient to no paine nor danger thereby, no nor colour of danger or paine at all.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, by reaſon that the <hi>Traſines</hi> taper heads are made and framed, to cut every way alike, as is ſaid, the work is eaſier and ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner performed therewith, then with the <hi>Trapan,</hi> as by the proving it upon a Calves head you eaſily ſhall make the experience, provided as is fitting in the time of piercing, you ſometimes take out the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and wipe the teeth thereof that it furre not too much, and thereby hinder the due penetration: alſo thereby you eaſily may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how farre you have penetrated, and what remaineth unpierced, that you may doe what is juſt in the work of penetration and no more.</p>
                  <p>Yet I will never deny, but doe acknowledge that the <hi>Trapan</hi> hath deſerved great praiſes from former ages, for that it hath been an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:37024:161"/>
that hath preſerved many a man, woman and childs life, from the eminent danger of death, and whereby they have bin re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to good and perfect health againe, and if that any by omiſſion or error in the uſe thereof have dyed, they are at reſt by it; and if the younger Artiſt doe by his experience, find that this my addition deſerve ought, let God have the prayſe in his mercies to weak men, for the comfort they find thereby in their wofull diſtreſſes, and as for this my Addition of invention, I muſt confeſſe is not much, onely good will, for all men may well conceive, that it is more eaſy to add to another mans invention, then to invent a new thing of his owne.</p>
                  <p>The next obſervation conſiderable in the fitting of the <hi>Trafine</hi> due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the work is, for the regulating the center or point of this orbe or circumference, I meane of this <hi>Trafine</hi> head, it is firſt to be well conſidered, that the pin thereunto belonging being placed truly in the center be artificially made of good ſteel, and that it be triangular, alſo that it be ſharp each way well pointed, and ſtand faſt in the Inſtrument, and alſo that it ſtand no lower, but alwayes ſomewhat higher then the circumferent teeth of the head of that Inſtrument doe, for becauſe the ſaid pinne in the center guideth the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent tooth-head-ſaw, to the beginning of the work, and in the agitating and moving of the <hi>Trafine</hi> with the hand to and fro in this work, the ſaid pin may firſt take hold, ere the teeth of the Inſtrument touch the ſcull, for that the ſaid pin is not onely appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as a rule and guide, but alſo as the ſtay to the work, which done, namely, when the tooth head orbe or ſaw, hath taken hold round, then the ſooner the better the Artiſt is to take up the Inſtrument, to wipe and cleanſe the teeth thereof, and draw out the ſaid pin in the center, the which he may no wayes omit; which done he is by the agitation of his hand onely to and fro to pierce, and having pierced as it were halfe through, he is againe to take up his Inſtrument and cleanſe it, and then againe to proceed in piercing by the motion of the hand to and fro, until he have in all parts gone through the <hi>Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi> which if he diligently regard in the tender obſervant motion of his owne hands, I mean he that pierceth ſhall ſenſibly feel when the bone is penetrated through on each part, which conſidered, then drawing off his Inſtrument, he ſhall find the peece of the <hi>Cranium</hi> ſo removed, fixed within the head of his Inſtrument as is ſaid.</p>
                  <p>But note nevertheleſſe, there is great care to be taken by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt in the manner of the piercing and taking out the peece of the fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured bone divers wayes.</p>
                  <p>And firſt let him be ſure, ever to place the broding head of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument that pierceth, ſo that the triangular pin in the center thereof be ſet upon a firme part of the <hi>Cranium</hi> or ſcull, yet alwayes provided it be near the fractured part thereof as may be.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the Artiſt is to conſider, that as he which pierceth the <hi>Cranium</hi> with a ſmall ſtreight head, ſuch as the <hi>Trapans</hi> were accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to have as is ſaid by the giving way of the ſmall ſcrew that faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:37024:162"/>
the head of the <hi>Trapan,</hi> the Patients life may be indangered, namely if the <hi>Cranium</hi> being throwly pierced, the Inſtrument ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually ſhould ſlip down upon the <hi>(Dura Mater,)</hi> as my ſelfe to my grief once ſaw: even in like manner he that uſeth a ragged taper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of a <hi>Trafine,</hi> how ſafe ſoever, may be guilty of indangering his Patient, if he be not careful in the manner of his piercing, namely, that after the Inſtrument hath taken hold round with the teeth, if he either leave the pin untaken out, the ſaid pin being longer then the teeth of the Inſtrument, he may wound the Panicle <hi>(Dura Mater)</hi> before the peice intended to be taken out, be pierced through in each part, or that he do not at the leaſt twice or thrice in the time of his piercing the <hi>Cranium,</hi> take up and cleanſe the teeth of the Inſtrument with a clout thereby as it were to miſtruſt himſelf, as fearing whether it have in all parts pierced through or not, or how much, or in which part he is wanting for feare of going too deep, otherwiſe he may kill his patient ere he doth find or perceive he is through, for a work ſo ſeldome uſed, and the errors thereof being of ſo dangerous a conſequent, the Artiſt, although otherwiſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, by omiſſion, oblivion, or other improvidence be wanting in ſome obſervation, highly worthy of regard; wherefore it beho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth him to ſuſpect himſelfe and be cautious, for that a man can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be too wary in ſuch a buſineſſe; for although the piece every way may be pierced and removed out of his place, yea, and contained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Trafine</hi> head, yea, and ſtick in the fame, yet the Artiſt may by his hand be miſtaken, and think it not to be through, for that the Inſtrument ſticketh as firmely, and as faſt in the place, when the piece is out and within the Orbe of the <hi>Trafine,</hi> as it did ere it was divided, and as if it had not gone through: hereby if the Artiſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve not his intermiſſions, by forbearing now and then his piercing, as is ſaid, and ſometimes view his worke, and cleanſe the teeth of the Inſtrument ere it be through, he is ſubject to goe too deep, and wound the <hi>(D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eth within the head of the ſaid Inſtrument: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all theſe obſervations, as I conceive, under favor, are but neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the young Artiſt to have in regard, <hi>Nam nimis cautla non nocet:</hi> To be exceeding wary is not hurtful.</p>
                  <p>And further, let the Artiſt be ſure that his <hi>Trafine</hi> be truly made of good ſteele, I meane the head of the pin or center, and the ends of the levatories, and that the pin ſtand faſt on, and directly in the middeſt of the head thereof, namely in the true center of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and alſo that the Artiſt have three heads of ſeveral ſizes in readineſſe by him is likewiſe very fitting, with alſo an Inſtrument called a <hi>Lenticular</hi> at hand, to cleanſe away all ſmall ſhivers and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpings of bones, juſtly proceeding in the operation of exciſion, as alſo for the removing whatſoever elſe may ſeeme by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to offend the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> or that way elſe might hinder hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="317" facs="tcp:37024:162"/>
And further, I adviſe that every young Artiſt take ſome convenient time before hand, to make tryal of his <hi>Trafine,</hi> as is ſaid, upon a Calves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, or the like ſubject, before he put it in practice upon a man, for a good Surgeon may erre, even in a ſmall omiſſion in ſuch a buſineſſe to his grief and reproach, if he be not exceeding cautious; and for that cauſe I adviſe every young Surgeon (as is ſaid) to ſuſpect himſelf, and warily to conſider that the precious life of man ſo dependeth upon the care, wiſdome, and artificial skill of the Surgeon in his work, as that upon a ſmall omiſſion or errour of forgetfulneſſe, or but a very little mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, a man is in a moment ſlain by art, for want of art, when it will be too late for the Artiſt within himſelf, to ruminate of the things that moſt conduced to the miſchief; and upon all occaſions, or omiſſions whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever befalling the Artiſt, let him ever be fearful and careful of entring too deep, for fear of wounding, or but ſcratching of the <hi>(Dura Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)</hi> for thoſe tranſgreſſions often produce fearfull accidents and deadly.</p>
                  <p>Again, as in ſpeaking elſe-where of the uſe of the <hi>Trapan</hi> I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, let every Artiſt be very well adviſed and fully reſolved of the juſt neceſſity of the uſe of the <hi>Trapan,</hi> and ſo of this Inſtrument, before he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to uſe it, and not lightly upon ſuggeſtions, or for vain oſtentation ſake, nor above all, for baſe lucres ſake, to put his patient upon the uſe of either of them, for that it is apparent, many great concuſſions, depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, yea and ſome fractures are cured without any ſuch Inſtrument; I have ſometimes alſo obſerved, that young Surgeons upon a raſhneſſe of their opinion, and now and then, for fooliſh vain glory and oſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſake, have been overforward in that point, of putting themſelves upon the work of piercing the <hi>Cranium,</hi> not attending the true time of nature, and by waiting to ſee what ſhe can or will perform of her ſelf, as in truth he ought to do, for that the Surgeon being natures hand-maid, not her guide, ought judiciouſly to attend her <hi>Criſis,</hi> and to procced by the adviſes of ancient grave Artiſts, that are experienced Surgeons in thoſe works; for ſometimes there are dangerous ſymptomes that ceaſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the uſe of the <hi>Trapan</hi> or <hi>Trafine,</hi> by making of a wound, or by the onely competent enlarging of the wound, in which work it is good to be very ſure in the making inciſion upon the head, that he do well divide the <hi>Pericranium</hi> ſo far as he intends to ſet his <hi>Trafine,</hi> at the leaſt where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever there is cauſe of enlarging or inciſing any would of the head for the <hi>Trafine,</hi> or otherwiſe for the onely dividing that <hi>Membrane,</hi> is in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny caſes ſufficient, and ſerveth inſtead of the intended work of piercing the <hi>Cranium:</hi> and further touching inciſion obſerve, that as too ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is not good, that the Surgeon ever have regard to preſerve the beauty of nature as much as may be; as ſuppoſe it were in any part of the face, to make too large an inciſion there, eſpecially when it falleth out to be near the temporal muſcles, or on the forehead.</p>
                  <p>Now a word or two more, and an end of that buſineſſe, concerning the <hi>Trafine,</hi> and I will conclude, there is yet a neceſſary Inſtrument, which of a kind of neceſſity, ought to be at hand whenſoever the <hi>Trafine</hi> is put to work, for that there may be unexpectedly uſe of it, and it is as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:37024:163"/>
named a <hi>Lenticular,</hi> or a cleanſer, which immediately after the eroding part of the <hi>Trafine,</hi> hath performed his fitting office and is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: this <hi>Lenticular</hi> or ſmoother, being a little warmed, is to be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the wound, where the eroding part ſtood, and with a gentle ſenſible hand to be paſſed to and fro upon that moſt tender panicle, I mean the <hi>(Dura Mater)</hi> thereby to bring away any ſmall eroſions, ſcrapings, duſt, ſpills of bones, or what elſe ſoever might be imagined, could give offence to that moſt ſenſible and noble Panicle.</p>
                  <p>This, with the premiſes well had in regard, I leave the young Artiſt to Gods bleſſing, and conclude this Chapter with a loving admonition to the younger ſort of my brethren, for their imitations; that like as our bleſſed Saviour ſaid to his Diſciples, in his ſpiritual Diſcipline to them, when he ſent them forth into the world, to preach the glad tydings of ſalvation, he admoniſhed them, and no doubt infuſed power ſufficient into them, to be wiſe as Serpents, and innocent or harmleſſe as Doves, and withal, willed them to beware of men; and even the like premoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion do I give to my Brechren of the younger ſort, concerning the great ttuſt of the precious lives and limbs of men, referred to their skill, truſt, and care, and namely, that they with the utmoſt that in them is, and even as they would anſwer it before their living God, who ſeeth not as men ſee, that with innocent hearts, they without any ſiniſter ends, truly and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully perform their charge, in healing thoſe whom they take into cure, and charge, and that in the obedience, and in the fear of God, their innocence may appear before God, and be witneſſed by their Works.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>uch is Gods manifest miraculous hand in his various and unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able wayes of afflicting Mankind in that moſt noyſome diſeaſe of the <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> that it is not onely wonderful, but alſo impoſsible for the wit of any man, how wiſe or learned ſoever he may esteem himſelf, or by others be eſteemed, to give a ſufficient reaſon, with alſo a general and methodical Cure for that moſt contagious, noyſome, and killing diſeaſe of the <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> for that it is apparent it paſſeth mans wit to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend or to avoid the moſt ſubtile invaſions and aſſaults thereof, as having in it <hi>(aliquid divinum)</hi> to be conſidered of, it being one of the three great and terrible Arrowes of the Almighty, whereby according to his Divine Will he hath uſually cut off ſinners from off the Earth almoſt in all Ages, and in all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as we may gather, and is at large read in holy Scriptures, and in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of good men, and daily experience declares no leſſe; all which, for brevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, I will omit here to repeat.</p>
                  <p>And his moſt uſual great and fearful Arrowes declared, are <hi>Wars, Famine,</hi> and <hi>Peftilence;</hi> and the moſt merciful of theſe three, which the Prophet <hi>David</hi> choſe, was the <hi>Peſtilence:</hi> which, although his mighty, fearful, and terrible hand be in it; yet for as much as his mercy is exceeding great, yea, over all his works, and that he hath not forbidden, but given us leave, with underſtanding, and ſome judgment, to make uſe of all lawful means to preſerve our frail bodies in health by all our best endeavour, ſo long as we truſt chiefly on his mercy, in the uſe of the means.</p>
                  <p>In regard whereof, I weighing with my ſelf how juſt and needful a thing it is at all times, but chiefly in contagious times, for all men, eſpecially for men of my calling, to ſhew their endavours for the help not onely of themſelves, but alſo of their Chriſtian Brethren, as well by directions as by preſervative and curative Medicines; I eſteemed it not amiſſe, by this following weak Treatiſe, to ſhew forth the fruits of my many years experience, touching the general knowledge of this diſeaſe, as alſo the beſt means I had experienced both for the preventing and curing of the ſame, when and where occaſion may be offered, either Domeſtick, Marine, or Military. And firſt, as by the way, take it into your conſideration, that this diſeaſe holdeth not one certain rule, figure, nor order in ſeizing on mans body, no, nor in one and the ſame houſe or family; neither are men generally taken ſick alike, no, nor directly, as in other times of the <hi>Plague</hi> they have been, but each time of Contagion hath different aſſaults, and difference in the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes. For in <hi>Anno 1625.</hi> we had many ſignes contrary to the <hi>Plagues</hi> in other times; yea, and many did dye daily, without any ſigns or marks on their bodies at all: and alſo ſometimes, as is too manifeſt, the <hi>Plague</hi> beginneth in

Winter, and that as well with us as with our neighbour Nations, as namely, <hi>Germany, France,</hi> the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> and other parts of the world it hath done: whereas for the moſt part, heretofore the <hi>Plague</hi> with us hath begun in Summer, and was commonly moſt fierce, predominate, and untractable to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines in the heat of Summer, and chiefly in Harveſt, which is the unſeaſonable time that we do uſually call the Canicular or Dog-dayes.</p>
                  <p>But the ſickneſſe of the yea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Again, ſome begin to complain of pain in the backe, and ſuch kinds of beginning, are more generally hopeful of healing then, when it beginneth hot (in my opinion) in ſome alſo it beginneth hot, with pain and giddineſſe of the head, and pain in the ſtomach: others at the firſt ſtroak or touch, find a general diſcouragement and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe over all the whole body, others at the firſt being taken in the head, their ſenſes are ſtupified and dulled: in others it beginneth with a raging and fierce fevour, ſo that their countenance is changed, their ſpeech fayling, or fainting, their eyes ſtrangely turning to and fro, in a feareful manner.</p>
                  <p>Again, others complaine of an extraordinary pain, with extreame heat inward in the ſtomach and intrals, when the outward parts are chil and cold, and ready to ſhake: again, ſome in the beginning com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of great thirſt; others complain of ſhortneſſe of breath, and paine in breathing; others ſwelling and ſoreneſſe of their throats which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſought into, no cauſe appeareth: Others have the Almonds or Glandules of their throat much ſwelled and inflamed.</p>
                  <p>Alſo many are taken with great defire to ſleep, and with frequent yawnings, and it is unſafe, in my judgment, to permit ſuch to ſleep before a Diaphoretick or ſweating Medicine have by the patient bin taken, and that it hath breathed out ſome of the venemous vapours by ſweat, with keeping them waking, till the medicine have wrought his effect.</p>
                  <p>Others are ſubject to great watchfulneſſe, and commonly thoſe are in their ſlumbers oppreſſed with grievous and fearful dreames and fantaſies.

                  <p>Wherefore ſuch ungratefulneſſe hath made me, in my old age, to call to mind the motto of <hi>Paracelſus,</hi> that moſt famous Artiſt, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly repeated.</p>

                  <head>A Caveat concerning fuming of Houſes, Chambers, or Garments, with Brimſtone.</head>
                  <p>THis one Caveat I deſire the Reader to take notice of, and to be warned, touching a groſſe Error by many uſed in their Fumes for Houſes or Apparell, which I have often obſerved; namely by the burning of Brimſtone to fume Houſes and Apparel with; which, in my opinion, as well they might preſcribe the fuming with Cinaber, Mercury, Arſenick, Rialger, or Antimony; for I am ſure, and can maintaine it, that the vapors are all venemous and deadly the one as well as the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The Fume of Brimſtone dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</note> And I can ſpeak it of practiſe and proofe, that I my ſelfe have ſeen killed Cocks, Hens, and diverſe other Birds and living creatures, as Bees, Gnats, Flyes, &amp;c. with the onely ſmoake of Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone; and upon good grounds, I will not let to ſhew any man the practiſe for his learning: and that it moſt artificially killeth Fleas, Flyes, Lice, Gnats, and Bees, I need not prove.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore beware of it, for the fume of Brimſtone is venemous and deadly, I know it; and that it is an enemy to the Brain and will quickly confound the animal faculties. My ſelfe have bin from my youth delighted in Alchymy, and have opened the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of diverſe Minerals and farmiliarly of Sal, Sulphure, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, to my no ſmall coſt, and now and then ſome danger; and therefore I wiſh all wiſe men to beware of them: But if any one will teach his Neighbour the practiſe of fuming his Houſe with Brimſtone, let him firſt fume his owne Bed-chamber well with it certaine nights together, and ſhut his doore, the Roome being filled with fume, and goe to bed; or any ſmall Roome that is cloſe, where he would have the true force of the fume, then brag how he likes it, it perhaps may coſt him too dear.</p>

                     <pb n="338" facs="tcp:37024:173"/>
And for his apparell, if it be either of wooll, or Silke, or of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen, it will ſurely doe hurt to it, as well by rotting them, as by ſtaining them.</p>
                  <p>There are ſome parts of the world, where there are great Mynes and mighty Mountaines of brimſtone perpetually burning: and it is affirmed, and for truth obſerved, that no Man, Beaſt, Bird, nor other living creature can live neere them, nor within the compaſſe of the vapor of them. Therefore I believe the author of the invention of fuming with Brimſtone, can never be able to make it good; that the vapors of Brimſtone are ſafe, nor ſo much as friendly to the life of man: witneſſe all the workers in like ſulphurous Metals, whoſe very countenance will witneſſe, that though the ſubſtances of Metals, are moſt ſerviceble to be uſed, yet their ſulphurous, Mercurial, and Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical vapors of them are often proved to be moſt deadly; yet will I not deny, but that Brimſtone is many wayes medicinable, and ſo is Quick-ſilver, to be taken into mans body, duly adminiſtred and prepared artificially; but not their crude vapors, by way of fuming. Thus much of Brimſtone, by way of fuming Houſes or Apparel.</p>

And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſaith he, the uſe of laxative and purging Medicaments are ill, hurtfull, and dangerous to the body, by reaſon of many evident caſes; therefore he likewiſe condemneth the errour of the unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and barbarous Phyſicians and Mountebanks of his times, which would drive away the cauſe of the diſeaſe by violent purging Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, as namely with <hi>Mercurius praecipitate,</hi> which red powder they call falſly a precious Cathartick or purging Medicine; which having a great force of heat in them, they do draw forcibly and ſwiftly both the blood and humours which are in the Veines, and do drive them out, to the prejudice of Nature: by which commiſſion, Nature which governeth the body, is diſabled, ſtupified, and beaten down in her endeavour, touching her <hi>Criſis,</hi> her working and contending with the poyſonous vapours, ſo as for the moſt part it hapneth, that thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on proceedeth a ſymptomatical expulſion, which is not far from death it ſelf. And therefore ſuch Medicines are not fit to be uſed in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſickneſſe, namely, the Plague. Moreover, all purging Medicaments draw the humours to the inward parts, that is, from the ſuperficies or outward parts to the centre of the body, which is the heart, and the effects follow deadly; for in venemous diſeaſes, the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomeought to be driven from the centre to the outwards: therefore Cathartick or purging Medicines being miniſtred in the beginning of this ſickneſſe, do more hurt then good. And in this further is to be added, that ſuch purging Medicines as are ſo ſtrong and ſharp, are eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be venemous of themſelves, and there is no venome or poyſon to be put to poyſon; for every ſuch thing as is added to his like, as the general Rule ſaith, maketh that more ſuch.</p>

                     <note place="margin">A note of the danger of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.</note> For you muſt note, that if you purge, if there be any venomoús quality in the body at all left, as is ſaid, you draw it to the centre of the body, namely, to the heart, and ſo double the danger; and for the reſt of the cure, no man can preſcribe what in each body ſhall be fitting by any one general rule, for that one perſon is ſeldome taken as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, in that fearful diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>Onely take this one thing for a rule of comfort in general, that this diſeaſe commonly is ſwift, and is ſhort, and doth begin and end in a moneth commonly at the utmoſt; for it is termed but the diſeaſe of one Moon: if the party be likely to live, and the danger of death for the time over, no Apoſtumes, Boyles, or Sores whatſoever do heal<note place="margin">Of the ſudden care of the Plague.</note> faſter, nor ſooner, then thoſe of that diſeaſe of the Plague do, when the fury of the Feaver is once paſt.

                  <p>And moreover, note one thing elſewhere mentioned; in all cordial Medicines and Julips, there is not a ſafer nor better thing to reſiſt the putrefaction and venom, to comfort the head and the ſtomach, and<note place="margin">Of the good uſe and danger of Oyl of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triol.</hi>
                     </note> to quench thirſt, then is Oyl of Vitriol, ſo you uſe it warily; but you muſt be very wary, that to one draught of Drink, or Julip, you put not above four, or rather but three drops; and uſing it but a very little at a time, you may uſe it the oftner, and the ſafer: otherwiſe, there is ſome danger therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The choyce of it.</note> You ſhall know the goodneſſe of this Oyl, by the clearneſſe thereof, and by the weight thereof, for if it be as clear as Rock-water, and pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous almoſt as Lead, then is it very good. By my will, I would never give any Purge, nor any Cordial without it, if I could have it; for I have found it, by much practice to be very precious.</p>
                  <p>Alſo, if you do take the quantity of one ounce of conſerve of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and about eight ſmall or ſingle drops of Oyl of Vitriol, and mix them exceeding well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and give the Patient a little thereof to eat, or at the leaſt to keep in his mouth now and then, in the time of his ſickneſſe, it is exceeding cooling and comfortable for him, and quencheth thirſt ſingular well.</p>

<pb n="360" facs="tcp:37024:184"/>
of ſweating; and to that end, be careful to provide them Waſtcoats, Sleeves, or, at the leaſt, the legs of old Hoſe, or any mean thing to the poorer ſort, to keep their arms warm.</p>
                  <p>For my ſelf know by experience of my own body, when I had the Plague, and ſo ſince of many others that have been under my cure, how comfortable a freedom it is for a ſick man to have leave to ſpread and caſt out his arms; and how uncomfortable a thraldome and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment it is for a poor weak man, by his Keeper, to be forced to keep his arms in the bed, or in any one certain poſition: Wherefore the attenders of the ſick ought to have judgment and commiſeration, I mean, a fellow-feeling of the infirmities of the ſick, and chiefly, in this moſt fierce diſeaſe of the Plague.</p>

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Fitting meats to be eaten by the ſick.</note> And firſt, for the delicate, and they which may have it, let them in the Name of God eat Pheaſant, Partridge, Quail, Chickens, Rabbits, Capons, Veal, Lamb, or Mutton; any of theſe are very good, taken with moderation. And ſo are all field-Birds, which are uſed to be eaten, excepting thoſe which live upon the Water, as the Swan,<note place="margin">Unfitting meats.</note> Gooſe, Duck, Plover, Wigion, &amp;c. Alſo generally the moſt kind of freſh-Water Fiſh may well be eaten of, except the Eel, the Tench,<note place="margin">Meats forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</note> and the Salmon: Playce, Flounders, Whitings, Soles, Smelts, and ſuch like, are good, moderately taken; alſo Pearch, Roch, Stone, Gudgeons, Breames, Trouts. Freſh Beefe and Pork are excepted againſt; and I think it fit to avoid it, where there is no want of other things. But on the contrary, where there is ſcarcity, let thy ability be thy guide; and in the Name of God, in want of others, let none be ſo unwiſe to refuſe Beef, nor the Broth or pottage thereof, for experience ſufficiently approveth them good; neither egges poached, nor ſoft ſodden; no, nor Bread and Butter, when their ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs will bear it; for theſe all nouriſh well, very moderately taken.</p>
                  <p>And remember, that if your Patient begin to amend of his diſeaſe, and that his appetite grow, deny him not competent food in a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring manner, and let him have, as neer as may be, that which is of light digeſtion, and not too much at once, but give it him often.</p>
                  <p>For underſtand, that after once the maſſe of blood hath been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and that Nature, by Gods mercy, with the help of good meanes, hath again gotten the upper hand, the body will require good nouriſhment, and often to be ſupplyed.</p>
                  <p>The uſe of Verjuyce is very wholeſome in the diſeaſe with Meats, and alſo in Poſſets, where inward heat is, and thirſt withal, but not where cold is: and the uſe of Gooſe-berries, of unripe grapes, Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Cherries, Prunes, ſowre Pomegranates, and the like, are very good, as is elſe-where mentioned; and no leſſe good is the uſe of Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Lemons, Pome-Citrons, and Pomegranates.</p>

                     <p>Alſo, in another place He ſheweth his diſlike of lighting a Candle and puting it under a buſhel, adviſing us rather to put it on a Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick, that it may give light to others.</p>

                     <p>All which precepts, together conſidered, I eſteemed it my duty (as commanded) to imploy my ſhort talent of healing, which God hath lent me, to the utmoſt for his Glory, and the good of others; and for that reaſon, as in part I have thought fit here following to publiſh by teſtimony, what good the aforeſaid antidote hath done already, onely in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> and <hi>Northampton,</hi> not accounting at all whom without teſtimony it hath healed, which hath bin very many, more then by teſtimony is fitting for me to produce.</p>

                     <p>To one <hi>Goody Smith,</hi> a Maulſters Wife, I gave two Pills, ſhe being very ſick of the Plague; by the firſt, ſhe had a Swelling appeared; and the next day I gave her another of the ſame Pills, which provoked her again to ſweat, whereupon the Swelling vaniſht away, and ſhe became thereby perfectly cured.</p>
                     <p>I could recite divers other Cures in like manner by your Powder performed, but for troubling you with tedious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitions: Wherefore I will thus conclude in the commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations thereof; that I adminiſtred it unto many, and of all thoſe I gave it unto, that either had the Plague, or any contagious or putrid Feavours, it cured them, and none that took it dyed under my Cure,</p>

not only of the fleſhy parts, but alſo of the nervous parts, even unto the very bone, yea, and of the bone it ſelf alſo. The cauſes of a <hi>Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cauſx Gangr.</note> by ſome learned Writers are reduced to three; the firſt, is when as a member cannot receive the vital ſpirits proper or natural due to it from the heart by the Arteries, by reaſon of a diſſolution in the mixture or harmony of the member, cauſed externally by extreame frigidity, as ſometimes it chanceth to be in a very cold and ſharp Winter, alſo by the inconſiderate and too too immoderate and raſh refrigeration of a Phlegmon, as alſo extreame calidity, as by ſcald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Liquor, or through ſome poyſonous diſpoſition in nature, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted in the parts affected, all or any of which do or may ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extinguiſh the natural heat thereof; if wholeſome remedies in time be not applyed, a <hi>Gangrene</hi> may juſtly be expected to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
                  <p>Another cauſe is, when as the vitall ſpirits in any member are obſtructed, ſuffocated, and finally extinguiſhed, by reaſon of ſome obdurate, ſchirrous hardneſſe and conſtipation of the Veines, arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries or pores of the skin, as in venemous or peſtilential Apoſtumes or Carbuncles is often ſeen, ſo that little or none of the venemous matter conteined in the Apoſtume or venemous tumour, can be digeſted or receive diſcuſſion, nor be brought to ſuppuration by apt Medicines, whereby Nature being above her ſtrength oppreſſed, and Art not ſufficiently ſuccouring, a <hi>Gangrene</hi> is produced.</p>
                  <p>Another cauſe may be by extreame ſtrong ligature, through the indiſcretion of unworthily termed Artiſts, or of unexpert Artiſts, as too often is manifeſt, and ſometimes by compreſſions, or other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceptions of blood or ſpirits, by which the vital ſpirits ſhould be tranſported to the member grieved.</p>
                  <p>The ſignes of a <hi>Gangrene,</hi> are theſe; an extinction of the lively<note place="margin">Sign of Gangr.</note> colour which was in the precedent Phlegmon, grievous pain and continual pulſation in the diſeaſed part, apparent by the Arteries, being at the firſt very ſenſible, but afterwards declining their due force, the part agrieved ſeeming for the moſt part, in colour to be blackiſh, blewiſh, or of a duskie or livid colour, yea, ſometime putrid, and being opened, a filthy Ichor and of an unſavoury ſmell procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from it.

                     </note> lib. 5. that in his time they uſed to take off the <hi>Sphacelated</hi> member, by cutting the fleſh round about unto the bone, in the whole part, near the rotten or ſphacelated part, and cutting ever in the live fleſh, not leaving any of the mortified fleſh untaken away; further <hi>Celſus</hi> (ſay<note place="margin">Another way of amputation.</note> they) doth admoniſh us in this work, that the skin and alſo the fleſh, be brought and drawn upwards, that the bone may be the better co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by ſome of the ſaid part, in the healing of the ſtump; but the ſame Authour confeſſeth alſo, that by ſuch abſciſſion cauſing exceeding pain, with over-large effuſion of blood and ſpirits, death uſually fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth: therefore to avoid hemorrage, they muſt preſently uſe actual Cauteries to burn the parts adjacent, in which may be conjectured, how cruel that courſe is to the Patient, and uncomfortable; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the upper part thick enough, to be a firm cover to the veſſels.</p>
                  <p>But after himſelf not approving that courſe, he ſaith, that he took another way of curing, which as he ſaid, happily ſucceeded; by which work no profuſion of blood hapned, becauſe no blood floweth from a mortified part, neither is grief moved therein; but leſt the corruption ſhould ſpread it ſelf further, (ſaith the ſaid Authour) I burned the putrefied part, remaining every where with red-hot Irons, that were heavy and well burnt, untill the Patient did feel the heat of the fire, and that he ſuffered ſome ſmall pain; and the rather they did it, they write, becauſe the ſame operation is very profitable, and therefore burned ever ſome of the ſound fleſh alſo, becauſe the putrefaction is beſt to be drawn out by a red-hot Iron, as I ſuppoſe, ſaith he, which is apparent to the eye, for the humours are apparently ſeen to boyl about the Iron; and likewiſe the weakneſſe of the parts conſidered by burning, it is fortified, the adjacent parts being freed from many noxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humours thereby, ſo that the weak part receiveth ſtrength, and within a few dayes begins to ſeparate the living from the dead part, and

ſo afterwards the dead part falls off, and the living part is conſerved. And this manner in my judgment, ſaith <hi>Fabritius,</hi> is beſt; but this Authour conceiveth <hi>Fabritius</hi> to be but a relater, not a true practiſer of the aforeſaid courſe in amputation, for that that work is ſo terrible and cruel nevertheleſſe.</p>

                  <p>LOving Reader, the general opinion of the moſt ancient, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the modern Writers, yea, and of the beſt Artiſts with us, at this preſent living, as farre as I can gather or conceive, is, that the fafeſt and beſt way for the cure of ſphacelated or putrid dead members, is to amputate them in the ſound part, and not in the putrid; and their general reaſons are, to prevent that none of the putrid, vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous or gangrenated blood, or ſpirits ſhould remain untaken away,<note place="margin">Enſe reciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum eſt, ne pars ſincera trahatur.</note> for fear it ſhould infect the ſound, and ſo conſequently confound the whole maſſe of the blood and ſpirits, and to conclude, kill the whole body; but the horrid pain the patient thereby ſuſteineth, with alſo the great uncertainty of his life, after his extream ſufferings, cauſed me ever to miſlike my own works therein, yea, although the ſucceſſe, for the moſt part, was anſwerable to my deſire.</p>
                  <p>And I further confeſſe, tradition tooke place with me in the Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital of S. <hi>Bartholomews,</hi> in part, where I was, as is ſaid, a Surgeon, for many years, yea, and that in my whole practice there, as alſo with the reſt of the Surgeons, my partners, untill after, reading ſome<note place="margin">Fruſtrà fit per plura, quod fieri poteſt per pauciora.</note> ancient Authors, I conceived; that I might in ſome caſes ſave a mans life, by amputating in the ſphacelated part: notwith ſtanding the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral vate and tenent aforeſaid, to the contrary; whereupon by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, about the year 1617. having a fit Patient, which had a mortified leg, and was as feeble and weak, as poſſible a living creature might, be inſomuch I was of opinion, upon the firſt view of him, that Natures third was at hand ſpun out in him, ſo that it was even ſinne and pitty for me to hinder natures courſe, or to ſhorten her courſe, in haſting it with violent Art, and namely by diſmembring him in the whole part, who had not blood and ſpirits in ſuch a caſe, according to the word, to keep life and ſoul together, but by conſequent, he muſt dye in the very act; and therefore I confeſſe, I intended the Patient ſhould dye by Nature, rather then to be killed by Art, ever eſteeming it a great ſin to take away a limb from any creature, but with ſome good hope thereby to preſerve his life: But again conſidering Chriſtian duty, and that I was tyed to do my beſt, to preſerve life, to the utmoſt in my power, I conceived there might be peradventure yet ſome ſmall hope of life, if I could without pain to the weak Patient, or loſſe of blood, ridde away his rotten member; ſo I in ſhort concluded to take it off in the dead place, which as all men may conceive, I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pain quickly effected, and by Gods mercy, the next day, I found
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:37024:199"/>
that my poor Patient, after the loathſome ſtinck of his putrid limb was removed from him, he began to chear up, and ſo after, from day to day was refreſhed more and more, and nature as it were rejoyced, even as a tree refreſheth after the dead boughs are pruned off, ſo my poor Patient grew more and more luſty and chearful; and to conclude, in the ſpace of 10. weekes, he was perfectly healed, and being then ſound and luſty, gave thanks to the Governour of the Hoſpital, in full payment of his cure, and ſo departed from the Hoſpital upon a leg of wood, he then being fair and fat, and very formal; the which bleſſing of health to the poor man, and light of knowledge, by that experience to me, did put me in mind of my duty in juſt thankfulneſſe to God, and alſo it animated me further to proceed in the like practice upon many others, which ſince that time, I have with good ſucceſſe, to Gods glory, in the ſame manner well healed; I then alſo began with my ſelf to conſider, and as it were to queſtion the reaſon, why this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Age of ours, conſiſting of more pregnant wits then former Ages, and that by good reaſon their judgments ſhould in Art farre exceed the former, as having had the experience, light, knowledge, and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples from all the precedent Ages; I ſay, I wondred they ſhould ſo clean have loſt, or omitted and paſſed by ſo worthy a work of practice as the aforeſaid was, it being of ſuch good conſequence in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and to let dye in oblivion, yea, and not only ſo, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to brand it with pittiful inhibitions, and conjectured ſlanders, and unfeaſableneſſe, for I cannot ſee how any man can juſtly averre a rule, to be ſo punctual, or ſo generally abſolute, that it may admit no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, for even this ſo ancient and great a rule, I hope the Reader will acknowledge is confuted, or anon will fully be by apparent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and common experience, (as namely) one way, if the Reader do but call to mind the workes of <hi>Gale,</hi> a late worthy Writer, he may find that he affirmes, and by ſound arguments well maintaines, that wounds made by Gun-ſhot were not venemous, as divers ancient Writers formerly had affirmed; and if ſo, how ſtands it then, that the amputation of ſphacelated members, proceeding by Wounds made with Gun-ſhot, not venemous, that the amputation of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the wounded or mortified parts, ſhould of themſelves be ſo poyſonous or venemous, that the whole body ſhould ſuffer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by? but I ſuppoſe one ſhould affirm it were ſo, yet the contrary by true, and yet viſible practice, is apparent, and to be proved, yea, and further by good practice, amputation in the mortified part, is experienced to be good practice in more venemous caſes, then in<note place="margin">For example.</note> Gun-ſhot: for my ſelf diſmembred a young man of a leg, in the putrid part, the mortification proceeding by a violent peſtilential Feavour, which many juſtly deemed to be venemous, far beyond a wound made by Gun-ſhot, yea, even venemous in the higheſt degree, and yet that legge being ſo taken off, the venemous diſpoſition thereof did ceaſe, and did not offend at all, but the Patient was quickly healed, and if the caſe be cleared by experience, that the venome from a mortified member, in the Plague; returneth not to hurt the Body, though

ſome caſes, which, although by all men muſt be granted, yet the practice of amputating in the putrid part muſt be held good: as for example, which I trouble your patience with, about 14. yeares paſt, there was a Miniſter, named <hi>M.

                     <hi>Suttons</hi> Hoſpital, in <hi>London,</hi> who had a corn upon one of his little toes, that troubled him, he being otherwiſe at that time in perfect health, and himſelf at evening going to bed, pared the ſaid corn with his penknife, that it bled a little, as he himſelf ſaid, but within a few houres after, his toe pained him very much, and grew to be inflamed; in the morning his foot was wholly diſcoloured, and gangrenated, and the Patient, with the violent fiercencſſe of a ſudden Feaver, by the pain then upon him, was wholly diſtracted, and in a <hi>delirium,</hi> which continued till the next day at night, and then he dyed: and this man was immediately before that accident, a man in perfect health, and of an extraordinary great ſtrength of body, yea, and wanted not the learned advice of the Phyſician; onely he had a full corpulent body, and was a very large feeder; ſo that to ſuch a patient, ſo fiercely viſited, I cannot conceive how any amputation, of what ſort ſoever, could have ſuccoured to have ſaved his life, for that in my opinion, the whole maſſe of the blood and ſpirits, were tainted and ſubjugated by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding fear, before help could take place: many other reaſons I have elſewhere inſtanced of impoſſibilities, or unfitneſſe in my judgement to injoyn any Artiſt to obſerve any one particular way, courſe or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of amputation, for that the occaſions of the <hi>Gangrenes,</hi> ſo much do differ, onely as elſewhere is recited for the facility thereof, and for the ſaving of blood and ſpirits, I have thought fit to commend to your conſideration this new method, as to the diſcretion of the Artiſt ſhall be eſteemed fit.</p>
                  <p>Alſo I have obſerved, that in ſurfeited delicate bodies of great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, ſuch as are over-pomper'd with pleaſure, eaſe, and fulneſſe, if by any way or accidents ſuch happen to have a <hi>Gangrene,</hi> ſeldome one of them eſcapeth death, eſpecially if they be ancient, and have the dropſie, or Scorbute, and on the contrary, amongſt thoſe which are weak, poor, indigent and miſerable people, which have bin by long continued ulcers, fiſtulaes, or other grievous maladies ſpent to extream weakneſſe, although ſeeming half dead before the work begin, ſcarce two of ten dye amongſt them, upon amputation, if the work be judiciouſly, and in a fit way and time performed; for I by practice have often obſerved, that where an infirmity hath pulled down a Patient low, and almoſt paſt hope of recovery, eſpecially if the diſeaſe proceeded by any outward violence, that ſuch bodies have bin by my experience found to be generally moſt hopeful of recovery, either by amputation in the one or the other kind, as the occaſion will moſt fitteſt bear; and on the contrary, perſons that are to be diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred in full ſtrength, if it be to be acted in the ſound part, bear a far greater venture of their lives, then the miſerable dejected wretches do, as aforeſaid, except it can be effected in the putrid part.</p>

Onely I deſire, that younger Artiſts would obſerve to hold the general rule in wounds made with Gun-ſhot, formerly touched; namely, that they foreſee where they cannot ſave a Limb to be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that they, with the approbation of the Patient, and likewiſe by<note place="margin">Advice for younger Artiſts in the cure of Gun-ſhot, by amputation.</note> good advice, they take it away in time, whileſt Nature is in her ſtrength: and if they have a fit mortified place, then to do it there if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly they can; and the rather, becauſe there the work is in part done to their hand; not regarding, though the ſtump fall out ſomewhat too long, for that the Patient hath the Artiſt ready ever when he pleaſe, in ſuch caſes as need ſhall require. But grant the amputation be to be acted in the one way or the other, yet the Artiſt may not be want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of cauterizing Buttons, at the leaſt of one, at any amputation, leſt having need on the ſudden, and unexpected, there be occaſion of the uſe of one of them, and by their want he loſe the Patient by improvidence, called had-I-wiſt.</p>
                  <p>But even now, me thinks, I hear one of the hotter ſort of my younger Brethren ſay, Will this old nan never have done, and ſhew us his Riddle? I have almoſt tyred my ſelf out with his circumlocutions: Why doth he not conclude, and come to the matter, after his long proceſſe? Wherefore, leſt he ſhould grow too much impatient, I will endeavour in ſome weak meaſure to pacifie him, and fall upon the buſineſſe promiſed. In which I conceive, and hope the friendly Reader may gather, and charitably think, that the ſcope of my precedent narrations to amputation at this time, is not altogether unprofitable, and impertinent to the matter in hand, although perhaps adjudged tedious; and namely, were it but onely for to introduct the younger Artiſt, and embolden him to the practice: that when I come to the point of the operation it ſelf, he may be the readier for the acting thereof; for, in truth, the method will be ſhort: ſo that a few words will ſuffice to expreſſe it, and a few inſtruments or medicaments for the efficiating thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Directions for the amputating Surgeon.</note> Wherefore, for the firſt work of amputating in the putrid part, let the Surgeon have at hand at the leaſt two or three miniſters or ſervants beſides himſelf, to aſſiſt him in the work, as is heretofore ſaid: and as for Medicines for the firſt dreſſing, let him have ready a good fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, being an artificial, ſtrong, well fitted <hi>Lixivium,</hi> that may have faculty abſterſive, deſiccative, and almoſt cauſtick, but not ſo ſharp, that it corrode the hands of the fomentor; let him alſo be provided with fit ligature, and with large woollen ſtupes, alſo with fitting boulſtring and convenient bandage: then let him further have ready for inſtruments, a fit amputating <hi>Serra,</hi> a Catling and a good ſmall inciſion Knife, a good pair of ſtrong Scizars, and three or four cauterizing inſtruments, ſuch as in their places ſhall be deſcribed: and when he proceedeth to the effecting of the inciſion, let one of the aſſiſtants take the upper part of the member, holding it in both his hands reaſonable faſt and ſteddy, I mean the whole part thereof, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what neer unto the unſound part, and let the other helper hold the
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:37024:207"/>
part, I mean the putrid part to be abſciſſed in his hand, each party holding reaſonable hard and ſteddy to the work, whileſt the Surgeon himſelf firſt by circumciſing divide the putrid fleſh from the bone, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſomewhat neer the quick part, but not too neer it, about one inch-full from the quick part, as may be imagined, will do well, that with the <hi>Serra</hi> he may come without fear to divide the bone or bones aſunder, where he is ſure they are ſphacelated, and that carefully firſt, having regard to make his inciſion wiſely and ſecurely in the inſenſible part, as is ſaid, not touching any quick part at all with his ſharp inſtruments, neither with the one nor the other; which he may the certainer obſerve to do, if with a Needle he enquire cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. Let him alſo divide betwixt the bones the putrid members or parts there being, leſt by lacerating or tearing with the teeth of the <hi>Serra</hi> he offend; which done, let the Artiſt amputate the bones.</p>
                  <p>And as for the reſt of the work, the putrid fleſh being (as is ſaid) divided, and bones being abſciſſed and ſo removed, there will be admitted deliberation ſufficient, with full time to conſider what is next to be done; the which will be, as in order, for diminution of the remaining excremental part, by abſciſſion or uſtion, one or both, to remove, for the firſt, as much more thereof as ſafely you may from the ſtump, with not being over-ſolicitous in taking all at one time: for in truth it matters not much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> neither doth it any thing haſten the work of healing, that all be at the firſt removed; but rather, it may bring terrour and danger to the Patient, to be too buſie or too forward; which by all means ſhould be avoided, for fear of inducing of a Feavour: onely it will not be amiſſe, at the firſt dreſſing, by cautery ſuperficially to run over the putrid fleſh, and alſo therewith to heat the end of the bone or bones abſciſſed; and alſo after that, with a good <hi>Lixivium ſatis calidum</hi> with ſtupes well to foment not onely the ſphacelated wounded parts, but alſo the parts adjacent, with ſufferable full warmth, for the ſpace of half an houre; not at all uſing any ſcarification in this whole work, for that it will bring terrour and needleſſe pain, and be fruitleſſe: which done, leave very warm woollen ſtupes upon the part; and ſo well bound up, finiſh that dreſſing.</p>
                  <p>Then the next work, namely, at the ſecond dreſſing, will be onely the reiterating of the Artificial former actions and application, ever (as aforeſaid) very warm fomenting, being ſomewhat hot, and the Medicine ever ſtill ready on the fire, and for the mortified part, onely to be applyed with a ſcalding hot ſmall Map, of purpoſe made, or a Spunge, and that with ſeveral and often ſhiftings and reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings for half an hour, or longer; provided, you diſcourage not the Patient, by ſcalding or excoriating the whole parts next adjacent at all: in which time, it will alſo be very neceſſary, that you have ready one or more of the cauterizing Buttons hot, to apply betwixt the fomentings; as alſo not omitting, if occaſion ſerve, with Scizers or otherwiſe, to be clearing any inſenſible ſloughs from the wounded
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:37024:208"/>
part: and forget not, at each dreſſing, with a Button to heat the end of the bone, untill the Patient be ſenſible of the heat, and no longer; the Buttons being of ſuch formes, as hereafter in their places ſhall be deſcribed; whereby the reſt of the putrid fleſh may by degrees be conſumed, eroded, abſciſſed, and fret away, as is ſaid.</p>
                  <p>But in this work, let not the younger Artiſt preſume, in a work of<note place="margin">A Caution.</note> ſuper erogation, or over-excellency, to be too buſie to ſcorch, ſcarifie, or excoriate the ſenſible part, in preſſing to take away all what is putrid from the quick fleſh, nor to cut or divide betwixt the quick and the dead fleſh, for fear of awakening of a ſleeping dogge; neither to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke pain to the Patient at all, as neer as he can, further then what of neceſſity ſhall accede in fomenting, whereby to miniſter a full and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient warmth to the whole parts, and no more; neither by extream hot ſtupes, in fomenting the living part too too hot, as is ſaid, nor by cauterizing ſo long, untill over-much pain be provoked: onely let all the operations and applications for the dreſſings, from time to time, be very gentle, mild, and pleaſing, as may be poſſible, to the Patient, but eſpecially for the firſt dreſſing, that without any great ſenſible pain the Surgeon may come ſomewhat neer the ſenſible and living parts, ever mildly eroding, clipping, and abſcinding onely the corrupt fleſh, and giving a lively warmth to Nature; and in this manner proceed thrice, if you ſee fitting, or at the leaſt twice for every twenty four houres, or as in deſcretion the diſcreet Artiſt pleaſe, and ſo for three dayes and nights together in this work, or as long or ſhort a time as cauſe ſhall offer: And you ſhall not need to uſe any cauterizing Buttons at all, after the firſt putrid fleſh is ero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, onely one, and that at each dreſſing you may uſe ſomewhat hot unto the remaining dead end of the bone, therewith to cauſe the ſaid end of the remaining abſciſſed bone to ſcale the ſooner: but after the ſecond or third dreſſing, it will be fit to conſider to apply ſome Unguent foveant and digeſtive very warm.</p>
                  <p>And as for further documents touching artificial proceeding in this Cure, I may as a ſuperfluous thing, and frivolous, forbear any further narration to the diſcreet young Artiſt or Scholar in Surgery, for that the reſt of the Cure will no way differ from the ordiuary way of the Cure of other ordinary Ulcers, but will be healed with much celerity and comfort, through Gods Favour, both to the Surgeon and Patient. And for the bone, fear it not; for by the onely hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the mortified end thereof, it will ſcale off by that time the Ulcer be healed, and that with fleſh incarnated upon the living part of it admirably, and will in fitting time ſiccatrize, and be perfectly whole, if the Surgeon will have patience with poor Nature in her weakneſſe to forbear, and not be too buſie, eſpecially with Mineral Medicines; all which I leave to the diſcretion of each underſtanding Artiſt: onely once more with this Caveat, as by reiteration, that for the end of the ſtump, after that it hath ſcaled, that the Surgeon be ſure to uſe no Mineral Medicine at all, as precipitate <hi>Vitriol,</hi> nor
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:37024:208"/>
any other, neither mixed with <hi>Baſilicon,</hi> nor otherwiſe, but with gentle and ordinary Digeſtives, Mundificatives, Incarnatives, and the like gentle Deſiccatives, or at the utmoſt, <hi>Parum Aluminis Usti,</hi> if need be: for that by experience I know, that Mineral Medicines, as they help to ſcale a bone, ſo they will ſurely help to defile even the ſame bone again and again, and ſo make long work upon work; the which is foul and hatefull for any Artiſt to be guilty of, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth to fear God; yea, and it is abominable to be wittingly tainted with that Devilliſh crime: for, let reproach and many evill Curſes ever attend upon that Surgeon, which willingly prolongeth healing; for which many an innocent Artiſt dayly ſtands accuſed unjuſtly thereof: which guilt I adviſe all the Sonnes and ſucceſſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">The concluſion.</note> And now to conclude, concerning amputation aforeſaid, ſee it be done in requiſite time: For the omitting thereof, untill the blood and ſpirits be too much ſpent, maketh often the ſucceſſe of the work doubtfull and deſperate, eſpecially where it is to be acted upon the whole part: for in truth, when the languiſhing Patient ſhall truly ſay, <hi>Deficit animus;</hi> it will be too late for the Artiſt to anſwer, <hi>Jam venio</hi> And ſo I will take my leave at this preſent, concerning the manual part of the work, in amputating in a mortified place: and for the doing of it in the whole part, I referre the Reader to what I have formerly, in my firſt Edition, in the <hi>Surgeons Mate</hi> explained, which, together with this Poſt-ſcript, I conceive may ſatisfie any indifferent Reader.</p>
                  <p>Onely one obſervation more, as in charity to the Patient and the young Surgeon, I thought fit to aquaint the young Surgeon with what my experience ſhewed me, and that is; That after any ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation either in the ſound or mortified part, the firſt eskers or cadave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſloughesbeing removed, and the Ulcers reaſonably digeſted, mondified, and ſomewhat incarnate, the Patient uſeth ever to be exceeding ſenſible, and grievouſly tender, and alſo fleſh is ſubject on the ſudden to grow over-faſt, and the ſtump is ſubject to turn can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous, or at the leaſt very dolorous: For remedy whereof, I uſe for one dreſſing, to have Pledgents of fine towe made ready before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, ſo much as will cover the whole Ulcer; and having ordinary good ſtrong <hi>Unguent. Aegyptiacum,</hi> without ſublimate, ſeething hot in a ſmall flat Pewter or Stone diſh, dip the pledgents therein, being very exceeding hot, and ſuddenly applyed ſo hot to the Ulcer, and bound with another thick pledgent to keep it warm, bind it up, and dreſſe it no more in 48<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> houres; and for the next dreſſing, cover the Ulcer onely with ſoft Lint; and likewiſe in all other dreſſings, provide by thick pledgents of towe ever to keep the ſtump very warm: and that one onely dreſſing, as aforeſaid, of <hi>Aegyptiacum,</hi> will wholly take away the tenderneſſe, and very much conduce to true healing; which a fourtnight after, if need be, may be reiterated.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="410" facs="tcp:37024:209"/>
And as touching amputation to be performed in the mortified place, for that the curing differs nothing from that in common uſe for the healing of Ulcers in general (as is ſaid) therefore if the diſcreet Artiſt have a ſtrong and fit <hi>Lixivium,</hi> a good <hi>Aegyptiacum,</hi> a Digeſtive, a Mundificative, an Incarnative, and a Deſiccative or Sigillative Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guent, and according to Art, and in their ſeaſons, make uſe of each of them; he is then fitted for the work.

                  <p>LOving Brethren, if the meanneſſe of my ſtile, the weakneſſe of my aged memory, capacity, or what elſe ſoever herein, is not anſwerable to thy expectation, from me, yet take it in good part, I pray thee, as proceeding from a Friend, who, if his Talent could have afforded better, would willingly have imparted it to thee. The former was the fruits of my Youth; This, ſuch as the weakneſſe of Old Age can afford. The publick good acceptance of the former, hath purchaſed the latter.</p>

                  <p>BEnevolent Spectator, here enſuing to thy view, are deciphered the Inſtruments moſt uſeful for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual operations of ſeverall Amputations in the ſphacelated parts of members, which being for memory ſake, onely deſcribed to the expert Artiſt, he will eaſily conjecture and reſolve in Art, according to each preſent occaſion, which of them to make uſe of, and which to omit: all of them tending to the ſcope of a reſolved ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciſsion, by ablating <hi>impurum à puro,</hi> the unpure from the pure, for the better perfecting the warrantable ſcope of the ſtudious Artiſt, in efficiating the ſame, that he may make a cure thereof, although detractors and depravers of that excellent myſtery of healing, maliciouſly make a by-word, or word of reproach againſt Surgeons, of making a cure; yet I will hope, if it be for the ſaving of the precious life of his miſerable Patient, the making of a perfect cure, will have a fair conſtruction from good men: yea, although it be to be performed as indeed it muſt be, part by abſciſsion, aduſtion, cauterization, by eroſion, or Serra, or how elſe ſoever the work may be ſafeſt, and ſureſt, and more artificially efficiated. All and every of which apparent particulars, in their due turns, times and orders, are to be made uſe of, which to deſcribe in each particular, or more thereof then is heretofore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, would be but tedious for me, and frivolous for the Artiſt, who joyning his reaſon and experience with the reading my precedent Relation, will doubtleſs, by Gods favourable permiſsion, make a ſound cure of his Patient: maugre the ſcandal of detractors, in the abuſe of that honeſt phraſe, to the reproach and unjuſt vilifying of many an honeſt well deſerving Surgeon. I end with an old Phraſe,</p>
