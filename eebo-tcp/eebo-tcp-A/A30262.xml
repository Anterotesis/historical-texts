         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO
THE HONOVRABLE
HOVSE OF COMMONS
now Assembled in PARLIAMENT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen first it pleased <hi>You</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
our service in Preaching
<hi>at Your</hi> late Publike <hi>Fast,</hi> we
resolved to close our eyes against
all Clouds of discouragement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rising
from our owne unworthinesse and insuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency,
and to set our selves wholly to seek what
the Lord would command us to deliver in his
Name, at such a time, to such an Honourable and
awfull Assembly,<note place="margin">Psalm. 82.</note> with a totall deniall of our
selves.</p>
            <p>And albeit we should have beene glad to have
beene spared this exposing of our selves to the
<pb facs="tcp:65552:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
publike view; yet, <hi>You</hi> appointing otherwise,
we hold it equall that the joynt <hi>entreaty</hi> of the
<hi>Representative Body</hi> of the whole <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty</hi>
of the kingdome should be regarded, and
have chosen rather that others should censure us
of <hi>weakenesse,</hi> than <hi>You</hi> should charge us
with <hi>Disobedience:</hi> Your <hi>Request</hi> being no
lesse than a <hi>command;</hi> and <hi>Your</hi> acceptance
sufficient to give value to things of themselves
both meane and worthlesse.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, according to our Duty, so wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
as the consciousnesse of our slender perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
would permit, we obey Your <hi>Order,</hi> and
doe now, although somewhat late, humbly offer
these two plaine Sermons (for, who expects other
in a <hi>Fast?)</hi> at the footstoole of <hi>Your Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi>
as a lasting Monument of Our Gratitude
for <hi>Your</hi> encouraging <hi>Approbation</hi> of, and
solemne <hi>Thankes</hi> for our weake endeavours in
the preaching of them.</p>
            <p>If in some places we have taken that just li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
which all others have done before us,
we trust it shall not be imputed; so long as in the
<pb facs="tcp:65552:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
most materiall passages we have kept to the very
words which at first wee used, so farre as was
necessary; and have not wittingly swerved an
haires bredth from the sense and substance in the
residue.</p>
            <p>Wee have indeed pared off some Repetitions,
which in speaking had their use, the more to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate,
and the better to set on the matter, but
would not have been so gratefull in Writing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Readers account every thing too long that
hath any thing too much. We have likewise con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
some expressions, which in discourses of
so much length, could hardly be so concise as wee
desired, Memory being not alwayes at hand to
give birth to every Conception of our minds in
such formes as wee intended. And some few
things we have added, where straites of time, or
defect of memory made some balkes in the first
delivery.</p>
            <p>What ever our performances be, we humb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
leave them in Your hands, and under Your
Honourable Protection, which we are bold to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
because they are by Your owne Act drawne
<pb facs="tcp:65552:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from us, and that in a time so queasie and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered
as can hardly beare that food, or Physik
which is needfull for it. Seldome <hi>doth a wise
Reproofe,</hi> a necessary <hi>Exhortation,</hi> or whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some

consultations by his own Counsell, to his owne
Glory; cover <hi>You</hi> still under his own Wing, and

had to doe with wise men, held it a point
of wisdome to passe by some things which
he would not have wayved among meaner
capacities. His practise shall be now my
president.</p>
            <p>This honourable Assembly having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
me to beare so great a share in this weightie Worke, I
hold it my dutie to consider, that, how weake and unworthy so
ever I my selfe be, yet I am now to <hi>speake to Wise Men,</hi>
who need not so much to be Catechised touching the <hi>Nature,</hi>
as to be incited and quickned to the principall <hi>Use</hi> of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
<hi>Fast,</hi> which consisteth not solely in such drawing neere
to God by extraordinary Prayer and Humiliation as may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a totall divorce from our deerest Lusts, but also (and that
more principally) in a particular, formall, solemne, entire
engaging and binding of our selves, by an indissoluble <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi>
to that God whose face and favour we seeke, and
implore.</p>
            <p>And this I apprehend to be a subject more necessary, by how
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:65552:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
much this dutie appeares to be lesse heeded and regarded by
the greater number of the choycest Christians.<note place="margin">The <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>For, as it too often falls out, even among the best, in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating
that sacred and dreadfull Ordinance of the <hi>Lords
Supper,</hi> (whereof also we are shortly to communicate) that
moe labour more to <hi>discerne,</hi> and <hi>feed</hi> upon his blessed Body
and Bloud, spiritually by faith, to make Christ their owne,
(which must be done too) than actually, totally, and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
(then) to devote, resigne, and yeeld up themselves
unto him, in the act of receiving, <hi>to be his servants:</hi> So it
doth not seldome happen in the exercise of holy <hi>Fasting,</hi> that
not a few of that small handfull which desire to approach the
presence of God in trueth, are more conversant in searching,
confessing, bewailing of sinne, and in craving of mercy, (all
of which are necessary duties) than in working up their hearts
to that indispensable pitch of heavenly resolution, sincerely
to strike through a religious and inviolable <hi>Covenant</hi> with
their God. Whereas, without this, all their labour will be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
lost, their expectations frustrate, they take the glorious
Name of God in vaine, provoke the eyes of his Glory more
against them, causing him infinitely to loath and abominate
both their persons, and service; nor shall they ever, by all their
crying, and sighing, no not by whole rivers of teares, be able to
draw down an arme of Mercy from Heaven to come and save
them.</p>
            <p>The more effectually therefore to provoke both my selfe and
you at this time, to the due performance of this most neglected
(but most necessary) dutie, I have thought fit, in a very plaine
and familiar way sutable to the nature of this exercise (which
ought to be as serious, as solemne) to worke and chafe into all
our hearts the strength and spirit of that good Word of God,

humble Judah by continually ringing in her eares the
dolefull tydings of a sore captivitie approaching, could
not be beleeved. But, when once the quick and sad
sense of their bondage under the Chaldean yoke had
forced from them an acknowledgement of the truth of
his prophecies, he found it as hard a taske to worke
their hearts to any hope of deliverance. For, as it is a
worke even insuperable, to possesse a people ripe for

the weight of their misery, the absence of God, (who
had <hi>cast them out of his sight)</hi> together with the insolence
and crueltie of their proud oppressors, had throwne
them downe so low in a disconsolate condition, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which God could either now say or doe, was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to raise up their hearts to any assurance of returne.
The same strength which Lust hath to draw men from

            </p>
            <p>The maine beame which stucke in their eyes to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

and invincible potency of the Chaldean Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
(then in her pride) and more especially the strength
of <hi>Babylon</hi> the Queene and Mistresse of that puissant

she that commanded the world detained them? <hi>Shall

            </p>
            <p>To cure them therefore of this desperate desponsion
of minde, the Lord stirred up this Prophet to foretell
the totall and finall subversion and ruine of <hi>Babylon</hi> and
of that whole Monarchy; and further, to declare from
God that the desolation thereof, should be the dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the captivitie of <hi>Iudah</hi> in it. The better to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
them of all this, <hi>Ieremiah</hi> wrote the whole Prophecy
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:65552:7"/>
against <hi>Babylon</hi> (contained in this Chapter and the next
following) in a Book by it self, which he sent to <hi>Babylon</hi>
by the hand of <hi>Seraiah</hi> (Lord Chamberlaine to <hi>Zedekiah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Jer. 51. 59.</note>
and now going in an Embassie from his Master to Great
<hi>Nebuchadnezzar)</hi> with Command from the Prophet
that, after the reading thereof to the captives, he should
<hi>binde a stone unto it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates,</hi>
with this saying pronounced over it, <hi>Thus shall Babylon
siake, and shall not rise,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But, to hasten to my Text, In the five first verses of
this Chapter, the Prophet summarily compriseth the
substance of his whole Prophecy against <hi>Babylon,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring,
1. her <hi>destruction,</hi> 2. the <hi>Meanes,</hi> 3. the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
thereof to the people of God.</p>
            <p>And first, he makes Proclamation, and an <hi>Oiyes!</hi> as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
it were, to all the world, to come and behold the Great
Worke he was to doe against <hi>Babylon</hi> the chiefe Citie of
the Empire, against <hi>Bell</hi> the chiefe Idol of that Citie,
and against <hi>Merodach</hi> the glory both of that Citie and
Empire; yea, though the King then reigning when God
meant to destroy it, should prove as potent as that great
King, the first of that name, who for restoring the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
Empire to her ancient Splendor, and for transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Imperiall Seat from <hi>Nineve</hi> to <hi>Babylon,</hi> was by
posteritie worshipped as a God, and transferred his
name to all his successors, as the name of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to the
Egyptian Kings, of <hi>Benhadad</hi> to the Syrian Monarchs,
and of <hi>Augustus</hi> to the Romane Emperours. Although
all these should be joyned together to withstand the
downfall of that Monarchy, yet desolation should be
brought over them all, they should all be confounded
and removed for ever, <hi>Vers.</hi> 1, 2. and all to make way
for the deliverance of the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:65552:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But what should be the <hi>meanes</hi> of such an unexpected
destruction? This was to be done by an Army from the
<hi>North,</hi> that is, by the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> both of which,
but more especially the <hi>Medes,</hi> were situated towards
the <hi>North</hi> from <hi>Babylon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Omne malum ab Aquilone.</note> and therefore ominous. That
these were the men, appeares more fully by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription
in the residue of this, and of the 51. Chapter.
This Northern Army should be the confusion of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
the confusion of <hi>Babylon</hi> should prove the restoring
of the Church <hi>(vers. 3.)</hi> And the restoring of the
Church should produce a <hi>Covenant</hi> with God.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> For, behold, the issue and <hi>consequent</hi> of the ruine of
<hi>Babylon</hi> was, the return of the captive Jews, from thence
to Jerusalem, and a renewing Covenant with him that
had shewed such mercy on them, <hi>vers.</hi> 4, 5.</p>
            <p>For, <hi>in those dayes, and in that time, saith the Lord, the
children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Iudah
together, going and weeping, they shall goe and seek the Lord
their God. They shall aske the way to Zion with their faces
thitherward, saying, Come and let us joyne our selves to the
Lord in an everlasting Covenant that shall not be forgotten.</hi>
This began to be fulfilled at the end of 70. yeeres deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
when the Empire was first over-run and subdued
by <hi>Cyrus</hi> the <hi>Persian.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 36. 22.</note> For he made Proclamation of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie
to returne, in the first yeere of his reigne. And
when they returned, this was their deportment; they
went weeping; and, <hi>to seeke the Lord their God.</hi> They
<hi>goe,</hi> not so much to repossesse their ancient patrimony
and inheritance, and to grow rich in the world, as to
seeke aud finde the Lord their God, and that with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to enter into <hi>Covenant</hi> with Him, and such a

and carefully performed.</p>

You now see the Context. Should I now divide the

            <p>First,<note place="margin">Actus.</note> an <hi>Act,</hi> expressed by their industry, in setting
upon a long and tedious journey to Zion. <hi>They shall

               <note place="margin">Modus.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, the <hi>manner</hi> how they manage this jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
it is
<list>
                  <item>1. With all <hi>intention of spirit,</hi> they aske the

                  </item>

much intention of spirit and inflamed charitie, calling

upon; all was for this: <hi>Let us joyne our selves to the Lord

            </p>
            <p>I might easily also cast out these generals of the Text
into many lesser branches: but it is not now a time to
trifle, or to play with a Text. Yea, I shall not distinctly
prosecute all the parts already laid out, but (as the dutie
of this day requireth) insist rather upon that which is
the maine, and bring in the other as subordinate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
by occasion afterwards, in explication of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall
point. For we see troopes in the Text bound for
<hi>Zion;</hi> and, so hasty <hi>thitherward,</hi> that they <hi>salute not any
man by the way,</hi> nor so much as looke aside any way: they
goe <hi>with their faces thitherward:</hi> all the stay they make,
is but to call others along with them, and amongst these,
us, saying, <hi>Come.</hi> And, what is the businesse; the end
of all this hast? Nothing but this, <hi>Let us joyne our selves
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:65552:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
unto the Lord in an everlasting Covenant,</hi> &amp;c. This, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it were last in execution, yet was it first in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
in the undertaking of this journey, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
now must be principally insisted upon.</p>
            <p>You see here a people loosed from the Babylonish
captivitie, and returning to <hi>Zion:</hi> and, in their returne
to have this in their hearts, in their mouthes, and in their
endeavours, namely, upon the receipt of this mercy, to
make speed to their God, to enter into a new Contract
and solemne Covenant with him. So that now the
chiefe, and only point of instruction which I shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
to, and presse upon you, and mine own heart
with you, is plainly this, that</p>
            <p>When God vouchsafes any deliverance to his Church,<note place="margin">The maine <hi>Observation</hi> or <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
               </note> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
from Babylon, then is it most seasonable and most ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
to close with God by a more solemne, strict, and invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable
Covenant to be his, and only his for ever.</p>
            <p>In prosecuting this point (wherein I resolve to be
plaine, and in earnest) I shall first shew you the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of it,
<hi>that it is so.</hi> Next, the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, if you will, <hi>how and in what

               </gap>, the

            </p>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that it is so, this will appeare,
1. More generally,<note place="margin">That it is so.</note> upon receipt of any deliverance.
2. More specially, upon any deliverance from <hi>Babylon</hi>
above all other.</p>
            <p>1. In generall,<note place="margin">Proved.</note> that this use must be made of any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance,

Scripture. We shall carry them along together.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. you shall finde <hi>Moses</hi> requiring the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to enter into a <hi>speciall Covenant</hi> with God,<note place="margin">Exod. 19. 5. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>beside the
solemne Covenant which he made with them (and they with</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:65552:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>him) in Horeb.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. That it is so, <hi>in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</hi>
               </note> To induce them thereunto, <hi>Moses</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresheth
their memory with the repetition or represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the many deliverances God had given unto
them, out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in the wildernesse by the space
of fortie yeeres,<note place="margin">The first so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which they passed into, was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance out of Egypt.</note> together with the wonders and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
which he daily wrought for them. And in the
seventh <hi>ver.</hi> he tels them, that <hi>when ye came into this place</hi>
(that is, into <hi>the Land of Moab) Sihon the King of Heshbon,
and Og the King of Bashan, came out against us unto battell,
and we smote them;</hi> &amp;c. What then? Here is deliverance
upon deliverance,<note place="margin">Vers. 1.</note> and the inference is, <hi>Keep therefore the
words of this Covenant, and doe them,</hi> vers. 9. But, that is the
Covenant on Gods part, you will say? True, but that is
not all. He therefore presseth them to an actuall perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Covenant on their parts, and that upon considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of so many deliverances. This was his maine busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
with them at the Lords own command. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in <hi>vers.</hi> 10. he thus bespeaks them,<note place="margin">A second Covenant, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fortie yeeres after the first, when they came neere to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan and shortly after were to enter into it.</note> 
               <hi>Ye stand this day
all of you before the Lord your God, your Captaines of your
tribes, your Elders, and your Officers, with all the men of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in
thy Campe, from the hewer of thy wood to the drawer of thy
water, That thou shouldst enter into Covenant with the Lord
thy God, and into his Oath which the Lord thy God maketh
with thee this day.</hi> And in <hi>vers.</hi> 14. he addeth. <hi>Neither
with you only doe I make this Covenant, and this oath, but
with him that standeth here with us this day before the Lord
our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day.</hi>
Thus you see a Covenant required, stricken, and ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by solemne Oath of God and his people mutually to
one another: they binde themselves by solemne Oath
to him, as he by Oath had bound himselfe to them.
Thus then it was in the time of <hi>Moses,</hi> No eminent
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65552:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deliverance went before, but a solemne Covenant fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
after<note n="*" place="margin">As <hi>Moses</hi> drew the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple into a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> before their entrance into Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an; so did <hi>Ioshua</hi> also, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were possessed of it, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 24. 25, 26. So did <hi>Iehoiada,</hi> upon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of Iudah from the tyranny of that blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy monster <hi>Athaliah, 2 King.</hi> 11. 17.</note>. And, To sweare a Covenant, is no new de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
no humane invention, nor arbitrary Action.</p>
            <p>I will give you but one instance more (among many)
of this kinde, and it is that of <hi>Asa,</hi> that good and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
King of <hi>Iudah.</hi> When <hi>Zerah</hi> the Ethiopian infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted
his kingdome with an huge army, even 1000000,
and 300 Chariots, 2 <hi>Chron. 14. Asa</hi> falls to praying, God
heard him; they joyned battell, <hi>Asa</hi> obtained the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory,
and <hi>carryed away very much spoile.</hi> What was the
issue? Another <hi>Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, in <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. you shall finde that, presently upon
this, God addresseth a Prophet to <hi>Asa, (Azariah</hi> the
sonne of <hi>Oded)</hi> to tell him and the people, <hi>The Lord is
with you while ye be with him.</hi> And, to encourage them
to close with God, he addes, in <hi>vers. 7. Be ye strong there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
and let not your hands be weake: for your worke shall be
rewarded.</hi> They must not only worke for God, but be
<hi>strong</hi> to his worke; and that they might be so, there
was no way like to that of entring into a <hi>Covenant</hi> with
him. For, so <hi>Asa</hi> understood it, as appeares by the next
words, where it is said, <hi>Asa, when he heard these words,
tooke courage;</hi> and, although he had before done much
in purging the Cities of Judah of Idolatry,<note place="margin">2 Chron. 14.</note> and Idols, of
high places, Images, and groves, yet now he goes on to
a more thorough reformation, and <hi>put away</hi> the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of <hi>abominable Idols out of all the Land of Iudah and Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin
and out of the Cities which he had taken from Mount
Ephraim, and renewed the Altar of the Lord;</hi> for ever
where Idols goe up, Gods Altars goe downe, therefore
he pulleth downe the one, and setteth up the other.</p>
            <p>And not this alone, but he offered unto the Lord a
great <hi>sacrifice,</hi> and both himselfe and his people <hi>entred
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:65552:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
into a Covenant to seeke the Lord God of their fathers, with
all their heart, and with all their soule, that whosoever would is
not seeke the Lord God of Israel, should be put to death, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
small or great, whether man or woman; and they sware
unto the Lord with a loud voyce, and with shouting, and with
trumpets, and with Cornets.</hi> And all this, immediately
upon the deliverance and victory which he had obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
for, in <hi>vers.</hi> 11. it is said expressely, that <hi>they offered
unto the Lord, the same time</hi> (or, <hi>in that very day)</hi> of <hi>the
spoile which they had brought, 700. Oxen, and 7000. Sheepe;</hi>
meaning of those, which they had carryed away from
the Ethiopians that came out to battaile against them.</p>
            <p>So that now you see another solemne <hi>Covenant</hi> entred
into, not by <hi>Asa</hi> alone, but by all the people of God, a
Covenant solemnized in publique by <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> by <hi>Oath,</hi>
and under the highest penaltie of <hi>death</hi> it selfe to all
that should not observe it.</p>
            <p>In pursuit of which Covenant, see what he presently
did. He spared not his owne Mother that regarded it
not. For, when he perceived that, notwithstanding this
Covenant, the Queene his Mother, <hi>Maacha,</hi> would

secretly, saying<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Let us goe and serve other Gods,</hi> she must
have <hi>been put to death,</hi> and <hi>his own hand must have been first
upon her,</hi> vers. 9.</p>
            <p>You now see the point proved in the generall, that
thus it is with Gods people; upon any notable deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<note n="*" place="margin">Yea, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times upon consideration of Gods Judgements felt, or feared.</note>, they enter anew into <hi>solemne</hi> and strict <hi>Covenant</hi>
with God.</p>
            <p>2. But more especially ought this to be the care of
the Church, when God gives her deliverance out of
<hi>Babylon,</hi> out of that servitude and bondage which of all
other was most heavy,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 29. 10.</note> and lay longest on her. See this
in some instances,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 34. 31, 32.</note> both on Gods part ayming at this in
giving deliverance,<note place="margin">2. In spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall.</note> and on his peoples part performing
this after deliverance from <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>On Gods part, first. This was foreshewed under the
similitude of the basket of</hi> good figs, <hi>Jer. 24. 5. There it
is said by</hi> the Lord, the God of Israel, Like these good figs, so
will I acknowledge them that are carryed away Captive of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,
whom I have sent out of this place into the Land of the
Chaldeans for their good: for I will set mine eyes upon them
for good, and I will bring them againe to this Land, <hi>&amp;c. And,
in the seventh verse it followeth,</hi> I will give them an heart
to know me that I am the Lord, and I will be their God: for
they shall retnrne unto me with their whole heart. <hi>He will
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:65552:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
give them an heart to</hi> know <hi>him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. That it is so, <hi>in speciall.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>to</hi> returne, <hi>and become
his</hi> people, <hi>which cannot be without a</hi> Covenant. <hi>Againe</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this is that which Gods heart is exceedingly set
upon, and full of, namely, that he never meant to bring
his people backe from <hi>Babylon,</hi> but upon this very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
(albeit it was a great while ere it was done, and
therefore they thrived accordingly, as we shall shew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non)
will yet further appeare by many other passages
of the Prophecy of <hi>Ieremy,</hi> to passe by sundry other
Prophecies uttered by <hi>Isaiah, Micah,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Ier.</hi> 30. 18. we shall finde a Prophecy, that this
should be done, (and I shall shew, by and by, that it was
afterwards performed) <hi>Behold,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>I will bring
againe the captivitie of Iacobs tents, and have mercy on his
dwelling places,</hi> &amp;c. and, in vers. 21. <hi>I will cause him to
draw neere, and he shall approach unto me;</hi> and then, as one
assured of it, and admiring at it, he presently adds; <hi>for
who is this that engaged his heart to approach unto me, saith
the Lord?</hi> That is, both Governour and people, all of
them should binde and engage themselves, (not their
outward man alone, but even their very heart and soule
also) by solemne Covenant to be the Lords. That this
was the meaning, is cleare by the next verse. <hi>Ye shall be
my people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I will be your God.</hi> For it was such an <hi>enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of their hearts,</hi> as that <hi>one should say, I am the Lords;
and another shall call himselfe by the name of Iacob: and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
shall subscribe with his hand unto the Lord, and sirname
himselfe by the name of Israel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vers. 31, &amp;c.</note> Isa. 44. 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So againe, in</hi> Ier. 31. <hi>the Lord having first promised
to bring back the captivitie, he subjoynes;</hi> Behold, the
dayes come, saith the <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ord, that I will make a new Covenant
with the house of Israel, and with the house of Iudah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not
according to the Covenant which I made with their fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:65552:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the day that I tooke him out of the Land of Egypt, which
my Covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto
them, saith the Lord. But this shall be the Covenant that I
will make with the house of Israel; After those dayes, saith
the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and
write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they shall
be my people. <hi>Here is a Covenant, God begins the work,
but his people follow. They imbrace the Covenant, and
joyne themselves by mutuall Covenant to him. He
puts his Law into their hearts, for this very purpose.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Once more. In <hi>Ier.</hi> 32. 37. there is a promise that
God would gather his people out of all countries whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he had cast them in his wrath, and that he would
bring them back to their own place, and cause them to
dwell safely. He presently addes this as the product of
that mercy; <hi>they shall be my people, and I will be their God,
and I will give them one heart, and one way that they may
feare me for ever,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I will make an everlasting Covenant
with them, that I will not turne away from them to do them
good, but I will put my feare in their hearts that they shall not
depart from me:</hi> Which words go no lesse than a solemn
Covenant mutually made and strucken betweene God
and his people.</p>
            <p>Thus then you see, many plaine and pregnant places
of Scripture shew, that the maine thing God on his
part aymed at, and expected from his people in deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them from <hi>Babylon,</hi> was, the firme and solemne tying
and engaging of themselves by a formall and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Covenant to him, and the <hi>remembring</hi> and keeping of
it better than formerly they had done.</p>
            <p>But, secondly, all these were but prophecies shewing
what God foreshewed should be. Will you therefore see
the thing acted, and all these promises fulfilled? True
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:65552:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it is indeed that the people did not on their parts per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
this, they entred not into such a solemne Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
so soone as deliverance was by <hi>Cyrus</hi> proclaimed;
and they sped accordingly. <hi>Zorobbabel</hi> went indeed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in the first yeere of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and laid the foundation
of the Lords House: but we read of no Covenant then
made. Therefore, the work was stayed, and the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not finished in an 100 yeeres after, say the best Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers.</p>
            <p>Then comes <hi>Ezra,</hi> and makes some reformation of
manners; and not only so, but some Covenant he and
the people entred into, <hi>Ezra</hi> 10. But that was but in a
particular case (and it would be thought a strange one,
to this age especially, should it now be pressed;) there
were many that had trespassed against their God by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
strange wives of the people of the Land (that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped
not the same God.) Such therefore, as now
were duely touched with the sense of this sinne, desire
<hi>Ezra</hi> that a solemne <hi>Covenant</hi> might now be made with
God, <hi>to put away all</hi> such <hi>wives, and such as were borne of
them,</hi> Vers. 3. Now, in the fifth verse, we shall finde this
executed. For, <hi>Ezra arose, and made the chiefe Priests, the
Levites, and all Israel to sweare that they should do accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to this word, and they sware.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was somewhat, but not enough: a partiall Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and such as came short of that intended in my
Text. You shall see it more throughly performed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
in <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> time. For, after <hi>Ezra,</hi> came <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemiah,</hi>
and he makes a more thorough Reformation;
not of mens manners only, but even of Religion also.
He set up the Ordinances of God in their puritie, and
tooke care in particular for the preaching of the Word.
After all this, he and all the people entred into a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:65552:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Covenant, and that at the time of a publique
Fast? And this brings it home to the businesse we are
now about. For, as they entred into Covenant upon
receipt of such a deliverance, so they did it at the time
of a solemne Fast. This will appeare throughout the
whole ninth Chapter of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> where it is first said,
that <hi>the Children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and
with sack-cloath, and with earth upon them: they separated
themselves from strangers, they stood and confessed their
sinnes, and the iniquities of their fathers.</hi> They justified
God in all his proceedings against them, and in all
the evils he had brought upon them. They acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
that neither they, their Princes, people, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
had kept the Law; they had not served God in
that Kingdome he had bestowed upon them. <hi>Behold,</hi>
say they, <hi>vers. 36. We are servants this day, and for the
Land that thou gavest unto our fathers, to eate the fruit
thereof, and the good thereof, behold we are servants in it,
And it yeeldeth much encrease unto the Kings whom thou hast
set over us, because of our sinnes: also they have dominion
over our bodies, and over our cattell at their pleasure, and we
are in great distresse. And because of all this, we make a sure
Covenant,</hi> in the last verse) <hi>and write it, and our Princes,
Levites, and Priests seale unto it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now here is the full accomplishment of that you have
in my Text. What in the Text is set down by way of
Prophecy, you here see acted in the History. In <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miahs</hi>
time, they come home unto it. And if you look
into the tenth Chapter, you shall see who sealed this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant:
first, the Princes, the Officers, the Magistrates
of the Kingdome, the <hi>Parliament men,</hi> if you will so call
them; and then the rest of the people. And what is the
substance of their Covenant? They <hi>entred into a curse,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:65552:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and into an Oath,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. How it is so.</note> 
               <hi>to walke in Gods Law, which was given by
Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements
of the Lord their God, and his Iudgements, and
Statutes,</hi> vers. 29.</p>
            <p>Here then is their Covenant: you see also with what
solemnitie it was made and ratified; by <hi>subscribing</hi> of
<hi>hands,</hi> and setting to of their <hi>Seales,</hi> by an <hi>Oath,</hi> and by a
<hi>curse;</hi> binding themselves by all the most solemne and
strongest bonds that possibly they could; and all this in
Publique, and at a <hi>Publique Fast.</hi> So that now the point
is cleare, <hi>That it is so,</hi> and that the practise of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
hath ever been, upon any great deliverance, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
from <hi>Babylon,</hi> to enter into solemne Covenant with
the Lord.</p>
            <p>Come we to the second branch propounded,<note place="margin">2. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Quomodo sit. How this is to be <hi>done.</hi>
               </note> which is
the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, shewing, <hi>in what manner</hi> this Covenant must
be made, and <hi>how</hi> men are to joyne themselves to the
Lord in this action.</p>
            <p>This I shall demonstrate out of the bowels of the
Text it self: for therein may you see somewhat requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<note place="margin">In a three-fold respect.</note> 1. By way of <hi>disposition</hi> or <hi>preparation</hi> to it. 2. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of the <hi>substance</hi> of it. 3. In regard of the <hi>proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
belonging to it. These being opened, I shall give
you a full view of this Text, and performe my promise
before made unto you.</p>
            <p>The first thing to be unfolded is,<note place="margin">1. Of the <hi>disposition</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to strike a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God. Whereunto is required</note> the <hi>disposition</hi> or <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi>
to the <hi>Covenant;</hi> and this appeares in two things,
1. In seeking seriously the face of God, <hi>They shall aske
the way to Zion.</hi> 2. In the manner of their addresse unto
him, <hi>with their faces thitherward,</hi> saying, <hi>Come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. The first thing requisite to <hi>dispose,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. The asking the way to Zion.</note> qualifie, and
prepare men to strike a Covenant with God, is a serious
and humble seeking of the face of God. <hi>They shall aske
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:65552:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the way to Zion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. How this is to be done.</note> And there first a word of the <hi>place</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
which they were bound; secondly, of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
and repaire to it, under that expression of <hi>asking
the way</hi> thither.</p>
            <p>The <hi>place,</hi> was <hi>Zion,</hi> where first (though it be but a
Criticisme, it is yet not unnecessary to be taken notice
of, because the word is often pronounced, and written
amisse, which may cause ambiguity touching the place)
you must put a difference between <hi>Sihon</hi> or <hi>Sion,</hi> and
<hi>Zion:</hi> (for these were two different places, and are
written in the originall with two different Letters, the
former with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the other with <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) you must not here
understand this,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> of the former, namely, of <hi>Mount Sihon,</hi>
which is all one with <hi>Hermon,</hi> situate in the utmost con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
of Israel North-East-ward, neere unto Jordan,
<hi>(Deut. 4. 48.)</hi> but conceive it to be meant of <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or
<hi>Zion</hi> in Hierusalem, which was once the strong hold of
the Jebusites, and held out longer unsubdued than any
Peece belonging to that people. For, when Israel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Conduct of <hi>Ioshua</hi> had conquered <hi>Iebus,</hi> after cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Hierusalem,</hi> yet could they not winne <hi>Zion</hi> in it.
<hi>Zion</hi> was a strong Castle or Fort, erected upon a rocky
mount, toward the South-west part of the Citie, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking
all the rest; and that the Jebusites, having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundantly
fortified and victualled it, still held, all the
dayes of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and long after, albeit the Israelites pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
the rest of the Citie, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 15. 63. But afterwards
when <hi>David came</hi> against it, even that <hi>strong hold</hi> (which
the Jebusites thought to be so invincible, that, in scorne
of him and his siege, they set up only a few blind &amp; lame
people on the walles to defend it) he conquered and
called it <hi>the Citie of David,</hi> because after he had wonne it,
himself dwelt in it, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5. 7. This, for the Topography.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:65552:14" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Then, you must know further, that, by <hi>Zion</hi> is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
meant the whole city of <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> by a <hi>Synech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche;</hi>
sometimes it was taken for the place of Gods
Worship in the holy city, or rather with reference to his
Worship and presence there: for that City being the
Capitall City of the Kingdome, where Thrones were
set for Iudgement, was also the speciall place which God
chose to place his name in: there, were the Altars placed
for Gods worship, and <hi>thither the Tribes went up to worship,</hi>
because there God pleased to manifest his more speciall
presence, and to <hi>command the blessing for evermore.</hi> Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
therefore these returning Captives repaired; even
unto <hi>Zion,</hi> the <hi>Watch Towre,</hi> as S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Hierome</hi> interprets it,
whence God in speciall manner watched over his people
for Good: there they seek his face, and enquire of him,
before they presume to enter Covenant with him.</p>
            <p>Now, their addresse to this place, is set forth in this
Text, by <hi>asking the way</hi> to Zion. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <note n="*" place="margin">From <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>to</hi> beseech <hi>or</hi> pray.</note>
though it sometimes import the demanding of a thing
which is a point of Justice or equity to give, (as Gen. 34.
14.) yet is it usually applyed to note the seeking of some
thing by humble prayers and intreaties: so as it is not
seldome put for prayer it selfe, 2 <hi>Chro:</hi> 20. 4. and, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
for an earnest &amp; humble enquiry after some thing
we know not, <hi>(Num: 27. 21. Deut: 13. 14.)</hi> that we
may be directed aright, and pursue the direction with
effect: So here, They <hi>aske the way to Zion,</hi> and that of
God, not onely <hi>to seek of him a right way for them</hi> by fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and prayer, <hi>Ezra</hi> 8. 21. but, as resolving that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
should be done, that they would walke in it, and
<hi>appeare before God in Zion:</hi> for, so much is intended
here as is expressed more fully elsewhere, viz. in <hi>Isay
2. verse 2, 3. Mic.</hi> 4. 1, 2. where they not onely call
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:65552:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
on each other to undertake, but they also performe the
journey, <hi>going up to the mountaine of the Lord.</hi> So the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Zachary,</hi> the inhabitants of one <hi>City shall goe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,
saying, Let us goe speedily to pray before the Lord,
and to seeke the Lord of Hosts, I will goe also: yea, many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
and strange nations shall come to seeke the Lord of Hosts in
Hierusalem, and to pray before the Lord.</hi> Zach. 8. 21. 22.
And how goe they? not sleightly, carelessely, proudly,
but in all humility, yea (as in the verse before my Text)
even with <hi>weeping,</hi> they shall seeke the Lord their God
with deepe humiliation and godly sorrow for all those
sinnes whereby they had formerly broken his Covenant,
and for which he had entred upon the forfeiture, and
laid those heavy afflictions upon their Loines. <hi>Going,
and weeping, they shall goe to seeke their God</hi> in <hi>Zion.</hi> The
very same thing was foretold before (to shew the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of the duty) touching Israel. <hi>Ier. 31. 9. They shall
come with weeping, and with suplications will I lead them.</hi>
So then, this is the first thing in this worke to dispose
and prepare men for the Covenant; namely, to <hi>aske the
way</hi> to <hi>Zion,</hi> by a serious, humble, affectionate inquiring
and seeking after God in his Ordinances, even with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
prayers and teares, that he would be pleased to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
them.</p>
            <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">2. In regard of the <hi>manner.</hi>
               </note> the <hi>manner</hi> of their addresse is as necessary
as the former. It is not every <hi>manner</hi> that will serve the
turne. It must be done with all <hi>intention</hi> of spirit in regard
of themselves, and with <hi>fervent Charity</hi> towards others.
For, they must aske the way to Zion <hi>with their faces thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therward,
saying Come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Their <hi>intention and fervency of spirit</hi> wherewith they
set upon this worke,<note place="margin">That is, 1. With <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</note> is set forth under that Hebraisme of
asking the way to Zion <hi>with their faces thitherward.</hi> This
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65552:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
phrase is usually an expression of the greatest intention,
fervency, and contention of mind that can be, in the
pursuit of any businesse on foote, or of any way wherein
a man is going. Such a phrase you have in <hi>Luke</hi> 9. 51.
where it is said of Christ, <hi>that he stedfastly set his face to goe

               </note> manifested, by his very countenance and
aspect, that, where ever his body was, his heart was at
Hierusalem (which the Samaritanes could not brooke)
and that nothing in the world could take him off from
that journey, or, so farre prevaile with him, as to make
him linger,<note place="margin">He will no longer turne aside hither and thither, and goe about their villages and Cities. <hi>Tit. Bost.</hi> in Luc. 9.</note> or loyter upon the way; no entreaties, feare,
shame, nor anything could stay him, but, <hi>obstinata et im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perterritamente
locum petiit,</hi> as it is exprest by <hi>Bede.</hi> He
was no way afraid, or ashamed to be seene and knowne
whither he was bound, and what he was going about.</p>
            <p>When therefore it is here said, they shall aske the way
to Zion <hi>with their faces thitherward,</hi> the thing meant
thereby, is, that they shall set upon this work with their
whole heart, with their whole man, without any feare,
or being ashamed, or unwilling to owne the businesse:
but, they shall doe it thoroughly and affectionately
without wavering, lingring, halting: they shall doe it
boldly, presently, openly, indefatigably and continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
In a word, whatsoever can be sayd, or thought upon,
to set forth the utmost intention of a mans Spirit in any
worke that his heart is most set upon, and that he would
lay out his life and all he hath upon, for the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of it; that was the resolution, &amp; care of these peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
&amp; must be ours: this is to aske the way to Zion <hi>with
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65552:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Our faces thitherward.</hi> And without this, no entring into
Covenant with God. This is, for substance no other
(though otherwise expressed) than that of the people
in <hi>Asa</hi> his time, when they sware the Covenant before
mentioned, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15. where it is said, they did it <hi>with
all their heart, and with all their soule,</hi> and exprest it by
the <hi>loudnesse</hi> of their <hi>voyces,</hi> and <hi>with shoutings, &amp;c: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing
at the Oath, because they had sworne with all their
hearts, and sought him with their whole desire,</hi> vers. 15. Men
that will stand disputing, consulting with flesh and
bloud, and casting about how the entring into such a
Covenant may consist with their profits, honours, lusts,
designes, relations, &amp;c. are no fit <hi>Covenanters</hi> for God.
<hi>His people shall be willing, Psal.</hi> 110 3. their heart, minde,
spirit, body, countenance, all, shall professe, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime
this to the whole world, that they are for
God, for a <hi>Covenant,</hi> for putting themselves into the
strongest bonds that can possibly be thought on to bind
them hand and foot, soule and body to the Lord for
ever.</p>
            <p>2. Nor is this all.<note place="margin">2. With cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie towards others.</note> For, the men in my Text, content
not themselves to be thus earnestly addicted to the
worke in their own particulars; but, (as one stick kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles
another) they desire to kindle the same flame of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in others also, and mutually to blow up the
coales in one another, <hi>saying, Come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This notes the <hi>fervency</hi> of their <hi>Charitie</hi> towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
also. For, 'tis not here brought in as a formalitie,
or complement, but as the evidence of a strong desire
to draw as many others as they can to the same journey,
and (if it be possible) to keep the same pace with them,
as being most unwilling to leave any behind them. This
indeed is true Love, unfained Charitie, to draw all we
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:65552:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
can along with us unto God. True Converts, when
once they returne themselves, <hi>they cause others to returne</hi>
also. And this was often prophecyed as a thing which
should certainly be: Witnesse all those places in <hi>Isay 2.
Mic.</hi> 4. and <hi>Zach.</hi> 8. before quoted. So then all these
things are requisite, and <hi>previous</hi> to the Act of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting
with God. There must be a seeking to God
with true humiliation, a seeking of him with all intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of spirit, and with all manifestations of a resolution
not to be terrified from, daunted at, or ashamed of the
worke: yea, with fervent Charitie to draw others into
the same Covenant also. Thus much for the disposition
previous to the Covenant.</p>
            <p>2. The next thing considerable in the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is,<note place="margin">2. The <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of the Covenant.</note> the
<hi>Substance</hi> of the Covenant it self. <hi>Let us joyne our selves
to the Lord, in a Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Two things here must be opened;<note place="margin">Both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,</note> the <hi>matter,</hi> and the
<hi>forme</hi> of this solemne action.</p>
            <p>1. The matter of this Act is set forth under this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
<note place="margin">1. Of the <hi>matter.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Let us joyne our selves to the Lord.</hi> The original
word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> (from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) is very emphatical; so as that
word, being explained, will sufficiently set out before
you the nature of the Covenant here intended. Some
Translators render it, <hi>Let us glue our selves unto the Lord;</hi>
which imports a conjuction so neere, as nothing can
come between, and so firme, as nothing can dissolve.
But more particularly, the verb here used is in Scripture
applyed to a double sense, or to denote two things: both
of which being set together, will fully discover what it
is to be <hi>joyned to the Lord in Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, it signifyeth the binding of a mans self to the
Usurer, of whom he hath borrowed money, to pay
backe both principall and interest. So it is used in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:65552:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5. 4. where the people complaine, <hi>We have bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
money</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note>, <hi>for the Kings tribute, and that upon our
Lands and Vineyards.</hi> That is, they had engaged both
Lands and Vineyards for securitie of the money bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed,
that the Usurer should enter upon all, in case
they failed of payment at the day. So that, as men, to
make sure, will have a <hi>Statute Staple,</hi> or <hi>recognisance in the
nature of a Statute Staple,</hi> acknowledged, whereby a mans
person, goods, lands, and all, are bound for the securitie
of the Creditor, that he shall have both principall and
interest at the day agreed upon (and here that of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
proves too true, <hi>The borrower is servant to the lender:</hi>
for, he hath nothing left to his own dispose; if he would
sell any Land, settle any joyncture, there is a <hi>Statute</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it, he can dispose of nothing till that be taken off;)
so it is in the case of any man joyning himself to the
Lord by Covenant, he must even bind himself to God
as firmely, as fully, as the poore borrower, who for his
necessitie takes up money, binds himself to the Usurer.
If God lend him any mercy, any blessing, he binds him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to restore not only the principall (the blessing it
self) when God shall call for it; but even the interest
too; I meane, all possible homage, service, and honour
which becomes those who have received so great a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</p>
            <p>This is more than implyed in that parable of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
touching the talents dispensed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. 27. for
even to him who had received but one talent, was it
said, <hi>Thou oughtest to have put my money to the Exchangers,
that at my coming I might have received mine own with usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
God will have his returne, some interest, for every
mercy; and expects a <hi>Statute Staple,</hi> that is, a Covenant,
for his better securitie. God will have him bound, soul,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:65552:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
body, estate, life and all; so as all he is, and hath, shall
be forfeited, if he do not keep touch, and make pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
according to agreement and Covenant made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them. This is the first use of the word, <hi>nilvu.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, there is yet more in it. For, though
it be true that the obligation of a borrower to the usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
be as strong as bonds and Statutes can make it; yet,
there is not such an entire, neere, firme, and lasting tye
of the borrower to the Lender, nor such a thorough in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in the whole estate of the Usurer, as there is of
him that is in Covenant with God. The Usurer, though
he bind the poor borrower fast to him, yet he keeps him
at distance, not giving him interest in, or use of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
part of his estate, but only of the summe borrowed.
But now this <hi>joyning of our selves to the Lord,</hi> is such, as is
made by <hi>marriage;</hi> and gives interest in all that the Lord
is, and hath, and admits us to the participation of all the
most intimate, neerest, choysest expressions of the dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
Love of God, which is or can be found between the
husband and the wife, who are <hi>joyned</hi> together by the
bond of marriage, and made one flesh.</p>
            <p>So the word is used, <hi>Gen.</hi> 29. 34 where <hi>Leah,</hi> being
delivered of her third sonne, <hi>Levi,</hi> thus saith to the
women about her, <hi>Now this time will my husband be joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> 
               <hi>unto me, because I have born him three sonnes.</hi> That is,
now shall my husband be more arctly united to me
in all love, and in all demonstrations of it, and that
in the most free, full, and intimate way of expression
that possibly can passe between those who are coupled
together in so neere a relation.</p>
            <p>So then, lay both these together, and you have a
cleare view of this <hi>joyning of our selves to the Lord</hi> by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.
He that enters into Covenant with God, doth
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:65552:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not only bind himself, as the needy <hi>borrower</hi> to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
<hi>Vsurer,</hi> for a <hi>time;</hi> but, as the <hi>wife</hi> to the <hi>hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi>
to be <hi>wholly his for ever,</hi> without any reservation,
limitation, or termination, till death dissolve the bond.
As the wife hath interest in the goods, estate, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of the husband; and all that he hath is hers: so by
this <hi>joyning of our selves to the Lord,</hi> He becomes ours,
as well as we become his, and both are mutually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned
to each other by an indissoluble bond for ever.
All the power, wisdome, goodnesse, mercy, grace, glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that the Great God hath to communicate to the
creature, is now assured and made over to every soule
that thus engageth himself unto him. And on the other
side, all the wit, strength, industry, wealth, honour,
friends, life, and all that this man hath, he makes over,
and resignes up actually, totally, absolutely, and for ever
unto the Lord, to serve and honour him withall; and
that with all his heart, and with his whole desire; to have
nothing, to do nothing, to be nothing but for the Lord,
though all the world be against him for it. This I take
to be the full latitude of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> for the <hi>Matter</hi>
of it.</p>
            <p>2. Touching the <hi>forme</hi> of this Act of <hi>joyning our
selves to the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. In regard of the <hi>forme.</hi>
               </note> it is expressed in the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> the
<hi>Covenant.</hi> A Covenant is nothing else but an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or bargaine between two or moe persons, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
(ordinarily) by some externall solemnitie, or rites
that may testifie and declare the agreement, and ratifie
it, whereby it becomes unalterable. Therefore it is,
that among the varietie of ratifications of Covenants
mentioned in Scripture, still there is somewhat of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
solemnitie reported to have been used at the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of them, to strike the bargaine thorough.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:65552:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sometimes they were made by <hi>Sacrifice, Psal.</hi> 50. 5.
sometimes by <hi>Oath, Deut.</hi> 29. sometimes by an <hi>Oath,</hi>
and a <hi>curse, Neh.</hi> 10. 29. sometimes by <hi>subscription</hi> of
their hands,<note place="margin">Isay. 44. 5.</note> sometimes by <hi>sealing</hi> it with their seales
also:<note place="margin">Neh. 9. ult.</note> Sometimes by all these, and by what ever else
might most firmely &amp; inviolable knit men unto God.
And as it was then, so must it be still. To strike a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
is not, in a private or publique prayer only,
to goe to God and say, <hi>Lord I will be thine, I here enter into
a Covenant with thee, be thou a witnesse of it,</hi> &amp;c. but it is,
to stand and make it <hi>publiquely</hi> before the Lord, by some
speciall <hi>solemnitie</hi> that may <hi>witnesse</hi> it to all the world, as
<hi>Iosiah</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">2 Chro. 34. 31.</note>, <hi>Asa,</hi> and all the Godly ever did; (even as in
in entring into bonds, or as in solemnizing of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,
men use to doe) Whether by the Sacrament of
the <hi>Lords Supper,</hi> by <hi>fasting,</hi> or by ought else, whereby
they may become so firmely and arctly joyned to the
Lord, that they may not only be no longer <hi>sui juris,</hi> to
depart away from the Living God; but, not so much as
to sit loose from God, or to stand in any termes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency,
which might leave them at libertie to serve,
or not to serve God in any dutie, how difficult, or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
soever. And thus have you the Substance of the
Covenant opened.</p>
            <p>3. Take we now a short view of the <hi>properties</hi> of this
Covenant,<note place="margin">3. The <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi> of the Covenant, which are two.</note> and they are two; <hi>perpetuitie</hi> and <hi>heedfulnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. It must be an <hi>everlasting Covenant,</hi> in regard of
continuance. In the Originall it is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Ages.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. It must be <hi>everlasting</hi> for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> And the 72 <hi>Interpreters</hi> render it to the
same purpose, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that is, such a Covenant as
no time shall terminate, till they who make it cease to
be. Some understand this of engaging themselves to
stick close to him in the due celebration of his Legal
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:65552:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
worship, so long as he should continue it in his Church,
(which was till, <hi>Shiloh</hi> came) without those mixtures,
wherein formerly they had been too bold, and for which
God had spewed them out of his Church, and hurled
them as farre as Babylon. Others conceive it to be
meant of the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> that God had sealed to
them in the bloud of his Sonne. But, neither of these
are ful. For, it is clearly meant of an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>theirs</hi> towards
<hi>God,</hi> whereby they bind themselves to him, and that not
for a definite time only, but for ever.</p>
            <p>It is such a binding, as that of the borrower to the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer,
whom nothing can satisfie but full payment. Or
rather, such a closing with God, as is that of the wife to
the husband, called, in particular reference to the nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall
knot, <hi>the Covenant of her God,</hi> Prov. 2. 17. She must
be his for ever; that is, <hi>so long as she liveth,</hi> Rom. 7. So
that, for men to bind themselves by an <hi>everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
to the Lord, is to bind themselves never to step out
from him to Idols, to their base lusts, to any creature, in
any strait, upon any occasion, or tentation whatsoever;
nor, with the dog, to returne any more to their vomit
of any kind. They are in Covenant as the wife to the
husband; for they are <hi>marryed unto the Lord for ever,</hi>
Hos. 2.</p>
            <p>2. It must be <hi>heeded</hi> and <hi>minded;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. It must be heeded, and <hi>not forgotten.</hi>
               </note> else, it will be to
small purpose to be so <hi>lasting.</hi> It must be a Covenant
<hi>that shall not be forgotten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Covenant, <hi>quod non tradetur oblivioni;</hi> as <hi>Tremelius</hi>
well: that is, that shall not be <hi>cast behind their backs.</hi> It is
but a plaine mockery for men so to enter Covenant with
God, as young Gallants enter into bonds to the Usurer,
never thinking more of them, till the day of payment
be past, and the Sergeant ready to attach them. <hi>Vnto the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:65552:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wicked saith God, what hast thou to do to take my Covenant
into thy mouth, seeing thou castest my words behind thee?</hi>
Psal. 50. Only they rightly performe this dutie, who so
joyne themselves to the Lord, as to <hi>remember,</hi> and <hi>minde</hi>
the obligation they have sealed. As a poore man that
meanes honestly, if he be necessitated to take up mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
upon his bond, he can hardly eate, walke, sleep,
do any thing, be in any company, but that still his minde
runs upon the obligation and day of payment: he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines
he is in debt, he hath given bond for so much
money, and all his care is how to pay his debts, or to get
longer time; so it is with a Godly man that hath entred
Covenant with the Lord, he hath sealed a bond, and he
knows it must be satisfied, or it will be put in suit. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he <hi>beares it in minde,</hi> he is alwayes casting about how
he may performe, and keep touch with God. <hi>I will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
forget thy precepts,</hi> saith <hi>David, I have inclined mine
heart to performe thy Statutes alwayes, even unto the end,</hi>
Psal. 119. 112. This is one expression.</p>
            <p>Againe, It is a Covenant to be <hi>remembred,</hi> as that of
the <hi>wife,</hi> whereby she stands bound to her <hi>husband:</hi> she
must ever remember it. It is the note of an harlot to
<hi>forget the Covenant of her God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 2. 17.</note> The chaste wife will so
<hi>remember</hi> the marriage bond, that if she be solicited to
unfaithfulnesse, to uncleannesse, &amp;c. she ever hath this
in her thoughts, that she hath given herself wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
to an husband, and is bound to keep her only unto
him during life; &amp; this makes her to be even an impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
wall against all assaults that might otherwise draw
her to folly. So must it be in the case in hand: The Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
must still be in the <hi>heart,</hi> and in the <hi>memory.</hi> In
every action of a mans life, in every passage and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of his estate and condition, in every designe or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:65552:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>this</hi> must <hi>not be forgotten;</hi> viz. <q>I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
into Covenant with God, as a wife with her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band;
will that I am now doing, or going about, stand
with my Covenant? Is this to performe Covenant
with God? &amp;c.</q> If he be solicited to uncleannesse, to
fraud, oppression, any evill whatsoever, this still runs
in his minde, There is a Covenant between me and the
Lord, I am bound from such courses by the strongest
bonds; <hi>How then can I commit this great wickednesse, and
sinne against God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What was it for which <hi>Iudah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 78. 10.</note> and <hi>Israel</hi> became <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,</hi>
but the breach of the Covenant? <hi>They kept not the
Covenant of God,</hi> saith the Psalmist. And, how so? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they did <hi>not remember</hi> it. As <hi>they soone forgot his
workes,</hi> so it was not long ere they <hi>forgot God their Saviour</hi>
himselfe too; and then no marvaile, if, at the next bout,
they forgot his <hi>Covenant</hi> also, <hi>Psal.</hi> 106. He then, that
would not <hi>breake</hi> Covenant, must <hi>not forget</hi> it; but <hi>mind,</hi>
and performe it. Otherwise, it is like <hi>vowing unto God,
and not paying,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccles. 5.</note> which is worse than <hi>not to vow</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>Thus have I dispatcht the Second <hi>generall,</hi> the <gap reason="foreign">

the face of God &amp; humbling the soule before hand; it
must be with all <hi>intention</hi> &amp; <hi>earnestnes,</hi> with fervent <hi>Love</hi>
and <hi>charity</hi> to draw others the same way. <hi>Next,</hi> in regard
of the <hi>Covenant</hi> it self, it must be an <hi>act</hi> &amp; <hi>firm joyning</hi> and
<hi>binding</hi> our selves the Lord, as of the <hi>borrower</hi> to the

Act,</hi> which may <hi>testifie</hi> it to all the world, and be a

               </note> upon <hi>any deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi>
in generall, are these.</p>
            <p>1. Because God,<note place="margin">1 God at such times gives clearest evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his readinesse to enter Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with us.</note> at no time so much as when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes
upon his people some notable deliverance, gives
such cleere hints and demonstrations of his willingnesse
to strike an everlasting Covenant with them. No sooner
had the Lord delivered Israel out of Egypt, but within
3. Moneths after, he commanded <hi>Moses</hi> to tell the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
from him; <hi>Ye have seene what I did unto the Egyptians,
and how I bare you on Eagles wings, and brought you out unto
my selfe. Now therefore if ye will obey my voyce and keep my
Covenant, then yee shall be apeculiar treasure unto me above
all people.</hi> Exod. 19. 1. and <hi>verse</hi> 4, 5. God himselfe, you
see, was now earnest for a <hi>Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is the nature of God, where he bestowes one bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,
to adde moe, and still to rise in his blessings. Where
he once opens his hand to take a people into his prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
he opens his heart to take them into his <hi>bosome.</hi>
Where he puts forth his <hi>power</hi> to <hi>rescue</hi> a people, he puts
out his heart to make them <hi>his owne,</hi> if then they have
eyes to discerne the opportunity. See this most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
demonstrated <hi>Ier.</hi> 32. from <hi>ver.</hi> 37. to the 42. His
gathering them from their <hi>Captivity,</hi> first warmes, then
melts, and after inflames his heart towards them, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it even then to glow as it were upon them, &amp; to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
restlesse till he have bestowed himselfe wholly on
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:65552:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them by solemne <hi>Covenant</hi> to be their God for ever.<note place="margin">3. Why it is so, <hi>in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Now then, shall God, at such a time, be so willing
and desirous to enter Covenant with men, and shall they
think it too much for them to be in Covenant with
him? Shall he be fast bound to them, and they left free
to sit loose from him? Indeed, this is that which our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
nature would willingly have: People would faine
be their owne men; which yet in truth, is, to be the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
slaves. Necessary therefore it is for men, upon receit
of <hi>any deliverance,</hi> to renew Covenant with God who is
pleased to honour them so farre, as to be in Covenant
with them. For, these two are relatives, and ever goe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<hi>I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</hi> God
is not the God of any people but of his owne Covenant-Servants.
The rest, he stiles, <hi>Lo-ammi.</hi> Hos. 1. 9. <hi>for yee
are not my people,</hi> saith he, <hi>and I will not be your God.</hi> They
will not enter into Covenant with me, and I will make
no Covenant with them. That is the first reason.</p>
            <p>2. As God is pleased to enter into Covenant with his
people,<note place="margin">2. God is content to be bound first.</note> so is he <hi>first</hi> in the Covenant. God requires no
man to bind himself by Covenant to Him, till the Lord
first strike a Covenant with his Soule. As <hi>we love him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he loved us first;</hi> so we enter into Covenant with
him, because he first entreth into Covenant with us. I
<hi>will be their God,</hi> he is first bound, and seales first; and
then, and not till then, it followes; <hi>they shall be my people.</hi>
This is the constant tenor of the Covenant. And shall he
begin, and we think much to follow? Can there be a
marriage consummated where onely the man is first mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
to the woman, and the woman will not after, for her
part, be married to the man? Now, God no way so much
declares his willingnesse to be in Covenant, and to be
<hi>first</hi> in it, as by deliverances (as we shall see more in the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:65552:21"/>
next reason:) great reason therefore, men should then
second him by mutuall stipulation. It is an hard case,
when men will not follow, where God leades.</p>
            <p>3. In deliverances God more especially manifesteth
his fidelity in <hi>keeping Covenant</hi> with his people,<note place="margin">3. In delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances God more especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his fidelity in the Grand Covenant.</note> even
when they have <hi>broken Covenant</hi> with him, and forfeited
all into his hands. When God delivers a people out of
any straite, doth not that usually suppose some <hi>folly</hi> of
theirs going before, &amp; provoking him to cast them into
that affliction;<note place="margin">Psal. 107.</note> whence, upon their <hi>cry,</hi> he is pleased to
deliver them?</p>
            <p>And when they have so farre and so long broken the
Lawes, and contemned the Counsel of the most high,
and <hi>dealt unfaithfully in his Covenant,</hi> as that he hath bin
even compelled to throw them into <hi>darknesse and the
shadow of death:</hi> yet if then, upon their humiliation, he
be pleased to <hi>deliver them out of all their distresses;</hi> this is
to give them fresh experience of his infinite love in
<hi>Keeping Covenant and mercy</hi> with them, that kept no
Covenant with him. This is called <hi>a remembring of his
Covenant</hi> with his people, after that <hi>their uncircumcised
hearts be humbled,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 26. 41 42.</note> 
               <hi>and that they accept of the punishment of
their iniquity,</hi> when God should have cast them out of
their land, among their enemies, as afterward he did.
So that, in a deliverance, that which is most predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in God, and should be most sweet and pretious to
his people and most eyed by them, is his fidelity, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and unchangeable Love in bringing out that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
he once made with them, and spreading it before
himselfe, and making of it good, even when they could
not exspect it, nor durst to plead it. Hence that passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
speech of God to rebellious <hi>Ephraim.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ier. 31. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Is Ephraim
my deare sonne? is he a pleasant child?</hi> As if he should have
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:65552:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
said, surely he cannot conclude so; yet, my love,
by vertue of the ancient Covenant betwen us, makes
me still so to account him: witnesse that which followes;
<hi>for since I spake against him,</hi> (that is, as resolving to cast
him off for ever) <hi>I remember him still,</hi> (I remember I am
in Covenant with him,) <hi>therefore my bowels are troubled for
him, I wil surely have mercy upon him, saith the Lord.</hi> Thus,
deliverance is a thread drawne out of the bowells of his
Covenant. Great reason therefore that, in this case, his
people should think of renewing their league and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with the Lord on their parts, when they have so
shamefully broken it, and yet he goes on in so much
mercy to manifest his fidelity in <hi>remembring</hi> and <hi>keeping</hi>
the Couenant on his part, by giving them deliverance.</p>
            <p>Againe, fourthly and lastly,<note place="margin">4 No complete deliverance and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, without a Covenant.</note> All our hopes of a <hi>full
deliverance,</hi> of complete happinesse, will be delayed, if
not frustrate; and, the next deliverance will stick in the
birth, and want strength to bring forth, if we come not
up to a Covenant for deliverances already received. If
God have delivered us once, he will do it no more: or,
if he do somewhat, to hold us up by the chin that we
sink not, yet will he hold us down from the throne, that
we reigne not, till we come up actually and fully in this
point of Covenanting with him. It is only to those that
<hi>take hold of his Covenant,</hi> that he <hi>gives an everlasting name
which shall not be cut off,</hi> Isay 56. 4, 5.</p>
            <p>He that hath obtained most and greatest deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,
will, ere long, stand in need of more. Now, one
thing is necessary to draw down more, and to move God
to <hi>command (further) deliverances for Iacob;</hi> yea, to
powre out his whole bosome into the laps of his people,
and to crowne all deliverances and blessings received,
with this assurance, that he that <hi>hath delivered,</hi> will yet
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:65552:22"/>
               <hi>again deliver;</hi>
               <note place="margin">3. Why it is so</note> and that <hi>is,</hi> to enter into a solemne Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with the Lord, upon consideration of what he hath
done already, how ever he should please to deale with us
for the future, or for removing any present pressures that
lye upon us.<note place="margin">See <hi>Iudges</hi> 10. from <hi>vers.</hi> 9. to <hi>vers.</hi> 17.</note> Although God begin to deliver, yet he
will never perfect the deliverance, till this be done.
The people which returned from <hi>Babylon,</hi> found God
to keep touch with them, to a day. So soone as the 70.
yeeres determined, their captivitie was dissolved, and
somewhat was done, the <hi>foundation</hi> of the <hi>Lords house</hi>
was laid, but the building went slowly up, the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Church and State went heavily on; and, they
were never in a thriving condition, till <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> by the
good hand of God, lighted upon this course. Some
<hi>Fasts</hi> they had kept before, yea very many; but they
never thrived, till he added to their publique and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
<hi>Fasting,</hi> the fastening of them to God by a <hi>solemne
Covenant.</hi> Then, the worke of Reformation, and esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment,
went on merrily, then they prospered. Thus
farre the Reasons concluding for a Covenant, upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of deliverances in <hi>generall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. The Reasons inducing us thereunto,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Why,</hi> for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from <hi>Babylon,</hi> in speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all.</note> upon deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance
from <hi>Babylon</hi> in <hi>particular,</hi> are these.</p>
            <p>1. Because <hi>Babylon</hi> (after once the Church was put
under her power) had alwayes been the most insolent,
heavy,<note place="margin">1. <hi>Babylon</hi> hath ever been the sorest enemy.</note> bitter, bloudy enemy that ever the Church felt.
The violence of <hi>Babylon</hi> was unsupportable, her inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
intolerable, her bloud-thirstinesse insatiable.
Hence the Church is bold to challenge all the world to
match her misery under the yoke of Babylon; <hi>Behold,
and see, if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, wherewith
the Lord hath afflicted me,</hi> (that is, by the heavy hand of
Babylon) <hi>in the day of his fierce wrath,</hi> Lam. 1. 12.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:65552:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
This was so sore,<note place="margin">3. Why it is so, <hi>in speciall.</hi>
               </note> that it hath been by some Fathers,
and others, conceived to be the fullest and most lively
typicall expression of that matchlesse agony and extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie
which our Lord himselfe (hanging upon the
<hi>Crosse)</hi> sustained, when he bare all our sinnes, and the
wrath of God due to us for them, so farre as to make a
full satisfaction to the Justice of his Father, in behalfe of
all his people.</p>
            <p>And, as it was with old <hi>Babylon,</hi> so it is, and ever will
be with the new, (I meane, <hi>mysticall Babylon)</hi> to the
end of the world; might she so long continue. Even
she also delights in no other drink but the bloud of the
Saints, as you shall finde in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 5. where the very
name written upon her forehead sufficiently sets out
her nature: <hi>Mystery, Babylon the Great, the Mother of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots
and abominations of the earth.</hi> And, what of her? <hi>I
saw,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Iohn, the woman drunken with the bloud of
the Saints, and with the bloud of the Martyrs of Iesus: and
when I saw her, I wondred with great admiration,</hi> vers. 6.
And well he might. A <hi>woman,</hi> and <hi>drunk!</hi> And, if <hi>drunk,</hi>
would no liquor suffice, but <hi>bloud!</hi> no <hi>bloud,</hi> but that of
<hi>Saints and Martyrs!</hi> She is never in her element, but
when she is swimming in bloud. So insatiable is she, that
like the <hi>horse-leeches</hi> daughter, <hi>she never saith, it is enough.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, when God gives any deliverance from
thence, there is more than ordinary cause to close with
the Lord, in a more solemne and extraordinary manner,
giving him the praise and glory of so great a mercy.
But then more especially, when God works out the <hi>full
deliverance</hi> of his Church, by the totall, and finall ruine
of <hi>Babylon.</hi> Oh then, then is the time when all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in heaven must sing <hi>Hallelujah;</hi> ascribing, <hi>salvation,
and honour, and power unto the Lord our God,</hi> Revel. 19. 1.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:65552:23"/>
               <hi>And againe, Hallelujah,</hi> vers. 3. as if they could never
sufficiently expresse themselves to God for such a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
such a mercy, such a vengeance.</p>
            <p>2. Againe.<note place="margin">2. Such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes more than ordinary breach of Covenant on our parts, for which God formerly put us under such a yoke.</note> When God delivereth from <hi>Babylon,</hi>
there is more than ordinary cause of entring into so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
Covenant with him, because the very subjecting
of the Godly under that iron yoke, argues more than
ordinary breach of Covenant with the Lord in time
past, which stirred him up to deale so sharply with them
as to put them under the power of <hi>Babylon.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
was exceeding great, too much to be endured
even by infinite Patience it selfe: else, the People of
God had never been cast into such a furnace. It was for
such a fault as dissolved the very marriage knot between
God and his people: it was for <hi>going a whoring from him.</hi>
For this it was, that God first <hi>put away Israel,</hi> giving her
a Bill of divorce, <hi>Ier.</hi> 3. 8. And for this it was, that he
afterwards cast <hi>Iudah</hi> also out of his sight, 2 <hi>King. 17.
19,</hi> 20. And as it was in former times, so in later Ages of
the world. What was the reason that so many millions
of soules have been exposed to the butchery of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ
in Mysticall <hi>Babylon,</hi> and to be so hood-winckt
and blinded <hi>by strong delusions,</hi> as <hi>to beleeve</hi> nothing but
lyes; even that Great, Great soul-killing <hi>Lye,</hi> that they
might be damned? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, it was this; <hi>They
received not the love of the trueth that they might be saved,</hi>
but <hi>had pleasure in unrighteousnesse, 2 Thess.</hi> 2. What <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse?</hi>
Is it meant of every unrighteousnesse
(that is in the nature of it damnable) which is to be
found in the world? Surely no: but <hi>(signanter)</hi> of that
<hi>unrighteousnesse</hi> whereby men <hi>turned the truth of God into
a lye,</hi> Rom. 1. that is, by corrupting the true worship of
the true God, and afterwards falling off to down-right
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65552:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Idolatry, even within the pales of the Church it self.</p>
            <p>Most of you are well seene in the History of the
Church, and can soone, point with your finger to the
times wherein <hi>Babylon</hi> began to besiege <hi>Hierusalem,</hi> and
<hi>Antichrist</hi> began to pull of his vizzard, in the Churches
of Christ: even then, when <hi>Pictures</hi> and <hi>Images</hi> began
first to be set up in <hi>Churches,</hi> for <hi>remembrance;</hi> then, for
<hi>ornament;</hi> then, for <hi>instruction</hi> too; and at last, for <hi>ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi>
and worship. Then, God suffered her to be over-run,
and over-spred by <hi>Babylon,</hi> as by an hideous <hi>opacum</hi>
or thick darknesse, and to be exposed and prostituted to
all manner of whoredomes and filthinesse: so as the
slavery of the Jewish Church in old <hi>Babylon,</hi> was scarce a
flea-biting, in comparison of the miseries of the Church
Christian under the <hi>New,</hi> which makes havock and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise
not of the <hi>bodies</hi> only, but even <hi>of the soules of
men,</hi> Revel. 18. 13.</p>
            <p>Now then, when God pleaseth to deliver a people
from such bondage, and to awaken them effectually to
look up, and to reflect even with astonishment upon
those great and gastly sins of theirs which had cut asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the cords of the Covenant between God and their
Soules, and provoked God to subject them to so much
bondage; and, that they must either renew Covenant,
or be obnoxious to more wrath, and be laid open to
more and greater temptations and sins; this cannot but
exceedingly work upon their souls, causing their hearts
to melt, and their very bowels to yearne after the Lord,
to enter into a new, <hi>an everlasting Covenant that shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be forgotten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is that which God by his servant <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> spake
touching the deportment of the remnant of <hi>Israel,</hi>
which should escape the sword among the nations and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:65552:24"/>
countries whither they had been carryed captives, <hi>Ezek.</hi>
6. 9. They should, upon such a deliverance, <hi>remember</hi>
God, not only with griefe, but resolution also to joyne
themselves to him more firmely in a perpetuall Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
For, of them, he saith there; <hi>they that escape of you
shall remember me among the nations, because I am broken
with their whorish heart which hath departed from me, and
with their eyes which goe a whoring after their idols, and they
shall loth themselves for the evils which they have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in all their abominations:</hi> And of the same people he
saith, afterwards,<note n="*" place="margin">cap. 11. 18, 19, 20.</note> that, upon their returne home, <hi>They
shall take away all the detestable things, and all the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
thereof from thence. And I will give them one heart,
and put a new spirit within them, I will take away the stony
heart out of their flesh, and give them an heart of flesh, that
they they may walke in my Statutes, and keep mine ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and doe them: and they shall be my people, and I will be
their God.</hi> So that here is a full Covenant striken, and
that upon this ground: viz. the Consideration of those
great sinnes they formerly committed, whereby they
had broken their first Covenant and departed from
their God.</p>
            <p>So farre the Reasons, and Grounds of the point; I shall
now as breifly as I can, endeavour to bring home, and
set on all by some Application, which I shall reduce to
3. heads, namely to matter of <hi>Reproofe, Information</hi> and
<hi>Exhortation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Application</hi> Threefold</note> For, if, <hi>When God vouchsafeth any deliverance
to his people, especially from Babylon, it be most seasonable and
necessary to close with him, by a more solemne, firme, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable
Covenant, to be onely his forever:</hi> Then,</p>
            <p>1. How may this reprove,<note place="margin">1. Vse, <hi>of</hi>s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofe.</note> and condemne of great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude
and folly, many sorts of men among us, that
are farre from making any such use of the deliverances
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:65552:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which God hath wrought for them. O beloved! Should
I but give you a Catalogue of the many, great, stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious,
and even miraculous deliverances which God
hath given us; the personall deliverances he hath often
given to each of us apart; the publique, eminent, glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
deliverances he hath given to us together with the
whole State; that, in 88. and that of 1605. I meane from
the horrid hellish <hi>Gun-powder-Treason;</hi> but especially,
and above all the rest, our happy deliverance out of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>
by the blessed Reformation of Religion begun a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
us, some good number of yeeres by past; the
time would faile me. But alas! What <hi>use</hi> have we made
of them?<note place="margin">Of foure sorts of men, viz.</note> Hath this <hi>use</hi> ever been so much as thought
of by us? Nay verily. For,</p>
            <p>1. Some thinke it bootlesse,<note place="margin">1. Of such as think a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but not after deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</note> thus to <hi>close</hi> in with God,
after an evill is over. When Gods hand is heavy upon
them, sense of smart compels them to thinke it then a
fit season to do somewhat, to confesse their sins; to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
themselves, and to seek God. <hi>In their affliction they
will seek me early,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hosea 5. 15.</note> saith the Lord. But so soone as he
takes his hand off from them, they cast all care away, as
if now (according to that homely proverb) <hi>the devill
were dead,</hi> and no further use of any feare, or diligence
were to be once thought upon, till (with <hi>Pharaoh)</hi> they
come under a worse plague than before; and, as if God
had delivered them to no other end, but to live as they
list, to cast more dung into his face, and to dishonour
and provoke him yet more than ever before.</p>
            <p>I appeale to the consciences of many who heare me
this day, and I require them from the Lord, to witnesse
truly, whether it be not even thus with them. If the
plague knock at their doore, if death get in at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
and begin to shake them by the hand; there is then
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:65552:25"/>
some apprehension of wrath and judgement; some hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling,
some hankering after God. Then, Oh what would
not these men do, what would not they promise, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to be delivered from their present anguish, and
feares! But once deliver them, and God shall heare no
more of them, till they be in the same, or worse case a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.
They turne <hi>Covenanters?</hi> Nay, leave that to the

above all others to preserve eternally in fresh remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,
and to think more seriously what God looks for
at all your hands upon such a deliverance) had there
been, I say, no possibilitie of escaping that Blow, what
would not men have then done! Oh what prayers, what
fasting, what humiliation should we have seene! But,
when the snare was once broken, what followed? A <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi>
with God? Nothing lesse; for, so soone as ever
the danger, the feare, the amazement at such an hellish
project, and the neere approach to the execution of it,
was a little over; the Traitors themselves fell not dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
into the pit of destruction which themselves had
digged, than generally all sorts of men did into the
gulfe of their old sins, as if they owed more to <hi>Hell,</hi>
than to <hi>Heaven,</hi> for so great a deliverance. And, is it
better now? Where is the <hi>Covenant</hi> (such a Covenant)
with God; that so wonderfull a deliverance deserveth,
and requireth?</p>
            <p>These men may please themselves, and feed sweetly
upon a vain dreame, that there is no harme in all this; but
the Apostle brings them in a sad reckoning, after a sharp
chiding for it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4, 5. What? saith he; <hi>Despisest
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:65552:26"/>
thou the riches of his goodnesse and forbearance, and long suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
not knowing that the goodnesse of God leadeth thee to
repentance?</hi> The end of all Gods <hi>goodnesse</hi> in forbearing,
advancing, and giving thee prosperitie; and of his <hi>long
suffering,</hi> in sparing thee when thou hast abused prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie;
and of all his mercy, in delivering thee out of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitie;
is, <hi>to lead thee to repentance,</hi> to draw thee neerer
to Himself, even <hi>in an everlasting Covenant.</hi> And if it
have not this effect on thee, the Apostle hath said it,
and the God of Heaven will make it good, that <hi>thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spisest
the riches of his goodnesse,</hi> &amp;c. Thou tramplest all
mercies under thine impure feet, when they do not raise
and scrue thee up so neere to thy God, as to enter a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne
<hi>Covenant</hi> with them. And, what then? Thou
wilt not stay there, but fall into more sinne, and under
greater judgement; and, <hi>after thy hardnesse and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
heart, treasurest up unto thy selfe wrath</hi> (that is, more
and more <hi>wrath)</hi> against the <hi>day of wrath and revelation
of the righteous judgement of God.</hi> This is the end of all
who make not the <hi>Goodnesse</hi> of God, a prevailing mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
thus <hi>to joyne themselves to the Lord;</hi> they fall into
moe, and greater sinnes, and abominations; and so adde
daily to that great heape, and to those Sea's of divine
wrath that hang over their heads, to overwhelme and
confound them for ever.</p>
            <p>2. Others,<note place="margin">2. Of such as having means of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance think it enough to rid out of the way the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of their evils.</note> if, after some time of lying under the

arrive at some hopes and opportunities of easing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
of those burdens, and of freeing the Land of the

strongly, that, if this be done, all is done. If but some of
the <hi>Nimrods</hi> who have invaded their Laws, and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

            <p>Oh Brethren! deceive not your selves. If this be all
you look at; if, upon opening this <hi>doore of hope,</hi> this be
all you ayme at, to make use of the time to secure your
selves against oppressors, and never thinke of closing
with God; or, but thinke of it; you may perhaps goe
farre in pursuit of your owne designes, in providing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the evils you sigh under; and, this Parliament may
do great things this way: But let me tell you from God,
that this will never do the deed, till the <hi>Covenant</hi> we
have been all this while speaking of, be resolved on, and
solemnly entred into by all those that expect any bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
from that High Assembly. Nor this, nor all the
Parliaments in the world shall ever be able to make us
happy in such a degree at least as we expect, till the Lord
hath even <hi>glewed,</hi> and <hi>marryed</hi> us all unto himself by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
Covenant.</p>
            <p>It is not only the making of good Lawes to remove
our present grievances; no, nor the cutting down of all
the evil Instruments in our State or Church at one blow,
that can secure us against the like; yea, worse evils for
the future; but rather, as one wave follows another, so
one mischiefe will still tread on the heeles of another,
and greater plagues will ever crowd in after the former,
till we close with God by such a solemne Covenant.</p>
            <p>The people of <hi>Palestine,</hi> or <hi>Philistia,</hi> made themselves
marvellous merry, when any of the Governours or Kings
of <hi>Israel,</hi> or <hi>Iudah</hi> (such as <hi>Sampson, David, Vzziah,</hi> &amp;c.)
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65552:27"/>
that had sorely yoked and hampered them, were remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by death, and others come in the roome that could
do but little against them. When such an one as <hi>Ahaz</hi>
who never wonne battaile of them, but still went by the
worse, swayed the Scepter; oh how joyfull were the
<hi>Philistines!</hi> But marke what a damp God cast in among
them in the midst of all their mirth;<note place="margin">Isay. 14. 28.</note> 
               <hi>Rejoyce not thou

(that <hi>Vzziah,</hi> and other Potent and successefull
Kings are taken away, and weake unhappy <hi>Ahaz</hi> come in

Cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent. Ahaz</hi>

               <note place="margin">See 2. <hi>King.</hi> 28. 8.</note> and plague them yet
more than all that went before him.</p>
            <p>And have not we seen this verified also neerer home?
Have not some, in former times, been taken away, who
have been great Oppressors, and Instruments of many
sore pressures? And, how have men rejoyced at their
falls? Nor know I, why they should not, if Justice in a
just way have cut them off. But alas! what Good, in the
issue, hath followed, or can be yet hoped for so long as
men continue <hi>Philistines,</hi> enemies to God &amp; his Church,
<hi>Anti-Covenanters</hi> (even with <hi>Hell)</hi> rather than true <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters</hi>
with God? Whether is our Condition any what
better now than heretofore, when those <hi>Leviathans</hi> were
alive, and in their height? I appeale to yourselves. And
the reason of all is this, that men mistake the meanes of
Cure, or at least fall short of it. The cutting off of evill
Doers (how necessary soever it be) is not all, nor the
maine requisite to make a people happy; unlesse also
there be a thorough joyning of themselves to God by
<hi>Covenant.</hi>

If you therefore that be now convened in Parliament,
should sit so long as you desire, even these 7 yeares, (if
your businesse should require it) and think, you would
make such Examples of men that have violated the
Lawes, and invaded your Liberties; and enact so many
wholesome Lawes to prevent the like presumptions for
the future, as should put us into a new world, causing
men to admire the happy state and frame of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which you would set up: yet all this would never
produce the expected effect, but prove as a meer dreame
of an hungry man, who <hi>in his dreame eateth</hi> aboundantly,
<hi>but when he awakes, is empty;</hi> unlesse you also, not onely

of their hopes: when Parliaments have been broken up
in discontent, <hi>when they have looked for Iudgment, and there

they have howled like dragons,<note place="margin">Isa. 59. 11.</note> not onely for afflictions,
but perhaps for sinnes also, especially if deliverance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
deliverance hath been snatcht from them, even when
it hath seemed so neer that they had begun to take pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session
of it: yet, (silly men that they are!) their evills
haunt them still, and prevaile more and more, after all
their fastings, humblings, and strong cryes to God their
Redeemer. For alas! what will all this doe without a
<hi>Covenant,</hi> without taking hold of God, and <hi>joyning
themselves</hi> to him to be his for ever? you may see such
a State of the Church as this described by <hi>Isaiah:</hi> &amp; good

               <hi>We all doe fade as a

And why all this? The next words will tell you; <hi>there is

none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up himselfe to

they did not at all call upon God, but, because they
did not so call upon him as to <hi>stirre up themselves to
take hold of him</hi> by Covenant; therefore is it accounted
no better than a not calling upon him at all. Thus men
lose not onely their opportunities of deliverances offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,

            <p>4. Some, it may be, goe yet further. Vpon the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of such a duty (so much pressed and inculcated)
they begin to be a little stirred; they are convinced that
it is is indeed true, such a Covenant is fit to be made: but
here (like <hi>Ephraim</hi> an <hi>unwise sonne) they stand still at the
breaking forth of the Children</hi> of the Covenant.<note place="margin">Hos. 13. 14.</note> They
faine would, but loth they be to go thorough with the
bargaine. They begin to come on, and then fall back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
They are so long a cheapning, treating, comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting,
disputing how safe it may be for them, how
well it may stand with their profits, projects, ends, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
relations; that they coole againe, &amp; never come up
to a full resolution. Oh, sayes one, this is a good course,
and fit to be taken: but, my engagements, callings, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance,
company, service will not consist with it. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sweares, he could find in his heart to make triall of
it, but that he should be jeered, scorned, and perhaps
lose his place, or hopes, for it: another, he is for it, but
at present he cannot enter upon it. Thus one thing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
still keepes this duty without doores, and holds
most men off from the worke for ever.</p>
            <p>But beloved, take heed of this dallying. What ever

            </p>

never looke for good from him, how faire soever thy

seene many a good day in my time, and hope to
see more, though I never swallow this doctrine:</q>
therefore he resolves to goe hence, as he came hither;
as he lived yesterday, so he will to morrow, though this
day he doe as his neighbours doe, keeping some order,
(much against the will of his base lusts that ring him but
an harsh peale in his eare for this little abstinence) yet to
morrow he will be for his swearing, drinking, whoring,
any excesse, and riot, as much as ever; and yet, by grace
of God he hopes to prove all these words to be but
wind, and to doe as well as the best of them all when he
comes to die.</p>
            <p>But woe worth the day that ever such a man was born

<hi>to-stand</hi> even <hi>this very day before the Lord, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

            <p>If he please himselfe with this, <q>Yet I shall live as

            </p>
            <p>2. This may <hi>informe</hi> us touching the true cause
(which most neerely concernes our selves) of the slow
proceedings of Reformation of things amisse among us,
both in the Church and Common-wealth: Why God
hath not yet given us so full a deliverance from <hi>Babylon;</hi>
why there have been so many ebbings and flowings in
matters of Religion, yea, more ebbings than flowings;
Why generall grievances swell to such an height, and
that all the opportunities of cure have vanished, so soone
as appeared: how it comes to passe that albeit God
hath moved the heart of the King to call Parliament
after Parliament, yet by and by, one spirit of division or
another, sometimes from one quarter, sometimes
from another, (like the <hi>evill spirit</hi> which God sent <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Abimelech,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judg. 9. 23, 24.</note> 
               <hi>aud the men of Shechem,</hi> to the ruine of
both) still comes between, &amp; blasteth all our hopes, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
us in worse case than we were in before; &amp; whence
it is (in regard of our selves) that in stead of setting up
the Kingdome and Ordinances of Christ in more puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
there is such a contrary mixture, and such a corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of all things, in Doctrine, in worship, in every thing;
<hi>Arminianisme, Socinianisme</hi> and <hi>Popish Idolatry</hi> breaking
in againe over all the Kingdome like a floud.</p>
            <p>What is a chiefe cause of all this? Have we not <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi>
have we not <hi>fasted?</hi> Have we not had more <hi>Fasts</hi> at
<hi>Parliaments</hi> of late, than in many yeares before? Yea,
hath not there been, generally among Gods people,
more frequent humiliations, more frequent seeking
of God, notwithstanding the malice and rage of some
men to discountenance and suppresse it, than in former
times? Why then is Deliverance, and Reformation so
slow in comming?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:65552:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Surely, Beloved, we have all this while mistaken the
maine businesse, and neglected the principall part of a
Religious <hi>Fast.</hi> You come, <hi>Fast</hi> after <hi>Fast,</hi> to seek God
in his House; You forbeare your victuals, afflict your
soules, endure it out a long time; you pray, heare, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
your sins, and freely acknowledge that all is just
that God hath brought upon us, and that we suffer lesse
than we deserve. All this is well. But here is the error, and
the true Cause of the continuance of all our evils, and of
their growing greater, namely, that all this while we
have never, in any <hi>Fast,</hi> or at any other time, entred into
such a solemne and publique <hi>Covenant</hi> with God, as his
people of old have often done upon like occasions and
exigents.</p>
            <p>That I may yet more effectually bring home this to
all our hearts, give me leave briefly to parallel the slow
pace of our deliverance out of <hi>Mysticall Babylon</hi> with
that of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and some of the remnant of Israel out of
<hi>old Babylon,</hi> which for a long time had held them Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives.</p>
            <p>And here first, be pleased to call to minde, that, as
touching the Captive <hi>Iewes,</hi> God failed not (on his part)
of his promise. At the end of 70 yeeres, libertie of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
from <hi>Babylon</hi> to <hi>Hierusalem</hi> was proclaimed, in the
first yeere of <hi>Cyrus</hi> the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarch:<note place="margin">Ezra 1. 1, 2.</note> whereupon,
many did returne,<note place="margin">Ezra. 2.</note> under the conduct of <hi>Zorobbabel.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come home to Hierusalem, we may not conceive
that they wer not at all touched with sense of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance,
or of the sinnes which had formerly provoked
the Lord to cast them into that great bondage out of
which they were delivered.</p>
            <p>Well, on they go; first, to offer sacrifices in the right
place,<note place="margin">Ezra. 3. 6.</note> 
               <hi>Although the foundation of the Temple of the Lord
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:65552:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was not yet laid. In the second yeere of their coming Zorob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babel</hi>
began <hi>to set forward the work of the house of the Lord,</hi>
and the foundation was laid. But the <hi>adversaries of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
(the Great Officers of the Kingdome under the
King of <hi>Persia)</hi> apprehending,<note place="margin">Vers. 8.</note> or rather pretending,<note place="margin">Vers. 10.</note> the
going on of this building to be matter of prejudice and
danger to that Monarchy,<note place="margin">Ezra. 4. 1.</note> they procure a stay of it, upon
reason of State; so as it was well nigh an hundred yeers
ere they got libertie to go on again, and it was above an
100 yeeres before the Temple could be finished. For, as
many exact Chronologers observe, the Temple was not
perfected in the reigne of <hi>Darius Hystaspis,</hi> as some have
thought; but in the sixth yeere of <hi>Darius Nothus,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
whom and the former <hi>Darius,</hi> both <hi>Xerxes</hi> (the
husband of <hi>Esther,</hi> and called in Scripture <hi>Ahashuerus)</hi>
and <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus</hi> successively swayed the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi>
Scepter. In all which time, many things were amisse;
Crueltie, Oppression, Adultery, Mixture with strange
wives, and other great deformations remained. Then
comes <hi>Ezra,</hi> after the Temple was finished, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
he did, to set forward the work of Reformation, in
the seventh yeere of <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ezra 7. 7.</note> successor to
<hi>Darius Nothus.</hi> And yet, there was much more to do.
After him therefore,<note place="margin">Neh. 1. 1.</note> comes <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> in the twentieth
yeere of the same <hi>Artaxerxes Mnemon;</hi> and, after all the
former endeavours, he findes the Church still weltring
in her bloud, and even wallowing in her owne gore; I
meane, in most of her old and long continued sins; (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
cured of Idolatry) so that still there was great
corruption in doctrine, in worship, and in manners.</p>
            <p>Whereupon he now resolves, and sets upon a more
thorough Reformation of all these; but could never
effect it, till beside the proclaiming, and holding of a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:65552:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
publique <hi>Fast,</hi> he and all the people lighted upon this
course, namely, of entring into a publique and solemne
<hi>Covenant</hi> with the Lord, <hi>subscribed, sealed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>sworne</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
as before you have heard:<note place="margin">Neh. 9. ult. <hi>and</hi> 10. 29.</note> and so, from that time
forward, the worke prospered, and the Church was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
of many abominations, wherewith till that time she
was defiled.</p>
            <p>Behold here, <hi>Quantae molis erat dilectam condere Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem,</hi>
how great a work, how long a businesse to perfect a
Reformation even of Gods deerest people. Their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivitie
in <hi>Babylon</hi> lasted not halfe so long time, as was
spent after their returne thence, ere their Reformation
could be brought to any tolerable perfection.</p>

            <p>Let us now reflect upon our selves, and the State of
Religion, and progresse of Reformation in our owne
Church, that we may make up the Parallel.</p>
            <p>Some beginnings of our deliverance from <hi>Babylon,</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:65552:31"/>
we received by King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth. For, he threw
out the <hi>Pope.</hi> His sonne King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and cast out Popery, in the body and bulke of it. A
great work, and a large step, for the short time of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
reigne. And indeed, he had many excellent helps
that way, (beside the zeale of his own pious heart) an
Excellent Archbishop, a Prudent and vigilant Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor,
beside others; else he could never have done so
much. Notwithstanding, the potency and secret under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minings
of those mightie Factions then prevailing, hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
the work not a little, so that it exceeded not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-<hi>Reformation;</hi>
yea, through the immature death of
that <hi>Iosiah,</hi> it soone prov'd abortive.</p>
            <p>The Princesse that came after, quickly turn'd the
Tide, before it was half high water: and she set all the
Gates wide open againe both for Pope, and Popery to
re-enter with triumph, and to drink drunk of the bloud
of our Ancestors, till God discharged her, and released
his people from her crueltie.</p>
            <p>So that when Queene <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (that glorious <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borah)</hi>
mounted the Throne, although her heart was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
and loathed the Idolatry of the former Reigne,
yet found she worke enough to restore any thing at all,
and to make any beginnings of a Reformation. She
soone felt, when she would have throughly pluckt up
Popery both root and branch, (superfluous Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
and all remaining raggs of superstition, as well as
grosse Idolatry) that she had to do with an <hi>Hydra,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
such a strong partie of stout Popelings to grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
with at home, and such potent and dangerous abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of them, to cope withall abroad. I need not name
them. I might adde hereunto, some difficulties arising
from the interests and engagements of not a few of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65552:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
those (though good, and holy men) that underwent
voluntary exile in the heat of the <hi>Marian</hi> persecution;
who, while they were abroad, had a large share in the
<hi>troubles at Franckford;</hi> (too eagerly, perhaps, pursuing the
<hi>English</hi> Formes of <hi>Worship,</hi> and <hi>Discipline)</hi> and so, when
upon their returne, they were advanced to places of
Dignitie, and Government in this Church, they were
the more apt and forward to maintaine and hold up that
Cause wherein they had so farre appeared, and for which
(some of them) with more heat than Charitie had so
openly declared themselves, in forreine parts. And so,
what by one impediment, and what by another, we see
it hath been a long time ere our Reformation can be
thoroughly polished and perfected as were to be wished
and desired; for there is nothing so perfect, here, but is
capable of more perfection.</p>
            <p>Nay, so farre are we become now from going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
with the work, notwithstanding the pietie and care
of our Princes since the last Restitution of Religion in
this Kingdome, that (as it was in <hi>Iosiahs</hi> time, though his
own heart were for God, yet there was a pack of rotten
men, both Priests and People, very great pretenders to
Devotion, but indeed mad upon Images, and Idols) we
begin to fall quite back again; and, not only to coast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
upon the brinks of <hi>Babylon,</hi> from whence we were
happily delivered, but even to launch out into her deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
Lakes of superstition and Idolatry, under pretence of
some extraordinary <hi>pietie of the times,</hi> and of some <hi>good
work in hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is the reason of all this, but that (not so much
as once) since the first beginning of Reformation of
Religion in this Island, we never (for ought I know)
entred into such a solemn, publique, universall <hi>Covenant</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:65552:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to be the Lords, as he requireth for those beginnings al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
given us; but have sate loose from God, and so
have not joyned together as one man, zealously to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne
his trueth and Ordinances, and to stand by him
and his Cause, as becomes the people of God, in all just
and warrantable wayes, against all opposers and gain-sayers.</p>
            <p>So long as we please our selves in this libertie of our
holding off from a Covenant with God, we may feed
our selves with vaine hopes of redresse of things amisse,
but shall speed no better than those libertines and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sliders
in <hi>Ier.</hi> 14. who lookt for great matters from God,
but came short of all, and then seemed to wonder at the
reason. For, thus they bespeake him, ver. 8. <hi>O the hope
of Israel, the Saviour thereof in time of trouble, why shouldest
thou be as a stranger in the Land, and as a wayfaring man,
that turneth aside to tarry</hi> (onely) <hi>for a night? Why shouldst
thou be as a man astonied, as a mighty man that cannot save?
yet thou O Lord, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy
name.</hi> See here how they are put to it. They acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
his Power, Goodnesse, Presence, yet they are not
saved. He seemes to be like <hi>Sampson,</hi> with his Locks cut
off, as if he were not able to save, or would not do it: and
this they wonder and stand amazed at, as a thing incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
and impossible.</p>
            <p>But, God makes them a short and sharp answer, (which
may also serve us) vers. 10. <hi>Thus,</hi> saith the Lord, <hi>have
they loved to wander, they have not refrained their feet;
therefore the Lord doth not accept them.</hi> If God be as <hi>a
wayfaring</hi> man; sometimes with a people, more often
gone from them; sometimes blessing, sometimes cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
them, and suffering them to fall under heavy pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures,
and never keeps an even and setled station or
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:65552:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
course of proceeding with them, it is but that he hath
learnt from themselves (as I may so speake:) they will
be their own men; they will not be tyed to him so strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
they will have some libertie for their lusts, for the
world, for the devill, for any thing: and loe here is the
fruit of it, God will not be bound to, nor walke with
them; he will not draw out that strength, that good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
that compassion which might deliver them from
the evils they howle under; He will neither heare them,
nor any body else for them; not <hi>Ieremy</hi> himself, <hi>vers.</hi> 11.
not <hi>Noah, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Iob, Ezek.</hi> 14. Nothing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but a more solemne and strict Covenant with God,
will put us into a posture and condition capable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
redresse of our grievances, how faire so ever either
now, or hereafter, we may seeme to be for it. This is
the second use.</p>

especially if you be carefull to Covenant with God.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65552:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Much lesse is it my purpose to draw you into that late
<hi>Ecclesiasticall Oath and Covenant</hi> (enjoyned by the late
<hi>Canon)</hi> which in my apprehension is little lesse than a
Combination and Conspiracy against both King and
State.<note place="margin">3. Vse, Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> My businesse is, meerly to perswade you into a

Reformation, have readily admitted: namely, every man
to stirre up himself &amp; to lift up his Soule to take hold of
God, to be glued and united to him, in all faithfulnesse,
sincerity, care, and diligence, to be onely his for ever.</p>
            <p>This if we doe, we need not care much for other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants:

us, when once this is done.</p>
            <p>Therfore I beseech you, yea, I require you in the name
of the God of heaven, whose you are, whom you serve,
before whom you stand, and from whom you expect
salvation in the midst of the Earth, as well as in heaven,
that you forthwith enter into this bond. Expect no assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
no successe in any of your Consultations, in any
Lawes that you agree upon, till you have fully brought
your hearts to this point, to follow the Lord fully; to be
no more for your selves than you would have the dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
wife of your bosome to be for any other man in the
world; but, to be wholly for the Lord, to imploy and
improve all your wit, abilities, industry, Counsells,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:65552:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
actions, estate, honour, and lives to promote his service
and honour, what ever become of your selves and yours
for doing of it. Say not as some Jeerers (of whom it is
hard to judge whether their malice or ignorance be the
greater) doe,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 10.</note> that there needes no more Covenants
than what we made in Baptisme,<note place="margin">Psal. 50. 5.</note> and that all other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
savour strongly of faction and the Puritan Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
For, so Gods people of old made a <hi>Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> by
<hi>Circumcision,</hi> and after by <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> that is, in every <hi>sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice</hi>
which they offered, they did renew their Covenant
begun in <hi>Circumcision.</hi> Neverthelesse, God thought it
necessary often to call them out to strike another so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
Covenant with him besides the former. You have
already heard that so soone as the Israelites were gone
out of Egypt,<note place="margin">Exod. 19.</note> &amp; entred a little way in the wildernesse, he
put them upon a <hi>Covenant.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 29.</note> When he brought them neer
to <hi>Canaan,</hi> he required another solemne <hi>Covenant</hi> of
them. And when <hi>Ioshuah</hi> had brought them into <hi>Canaan,</hi>
and divided to each of them the lot of his inheritance,
he drew them into another solemne <hi>Covenant. Iosh.</hi> 24.
So that here was Covenant upon Covenant, and yet can
no man (without blasphemy) charge it with any Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan
humour, faction, or any thing superfluous or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comely
for the Greatest on earth to submit unto.</p>
            <p>That I may a little more enforce this duty, and
quicken you to the imbracing of it, give me leave to
present you with some <hi>Motives</hi> further to presse you to
it, and with some few <hi>Directions</hi> to guide you in it.</p>
            <p>1. For, <hi>Motives.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Motives</hi> to a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, 1. Our many <hi>Deliverances.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Consider. 1. how many, great, admirable, and even
miraculous deliverances God hath given us; What
great things he hath done for us. No Nation under
heaven can say more to his praise, in this kind, than we
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:65552:34" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have cause to do. Our Great deliverances out of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
from the <hi>Spanish Invasion,</hi> from the <hi>Gun-powder Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
and from many other evils and feares, do all call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you for a Covenant.<note place="margin">Motives.</note> Yea, even the present Mercy
and Opportunitie of opening that Ancient, Regular and
Approved Way of cure of those publique evils that
threaten confusion and desolation to all, pleades hard
for the same dutie. But, among all these, I desire You of
that Great and honourable Body of the Parliament,
to reflect sadly upon that Stupendious Deliverance
from the <hi>Gun-powder Treason,</hi> which more especially and
immediately was bent against You. For, albeit the ruine
of the whole Kingdome was in their Eye who were the
Cursed instruments of Antichrist, and of the Devill his
Father, in that hellish Designe; yet, no blow could have
come at us, but through Your sides. And, albeit some
of You that have the honour to be members of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
Parliament, were then unborn; yet, had that Plot
taken effect, scarce any of You had been this day in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
to have sate there now, but had long since been co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
and buryed under the ashes of confusion. Thinke
now, whether such a preservation deserve lesse at Your
hands, than to give Your selves to your Great Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer,
for so Great a Deliverance, whereby three Nations
destinated at once to Death, received no lesse than a
joyfull resurrection from the Dead, and were again <hi>born
at once.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, let not this Great mercy seeme small in
Your eyes. And, remember too, that you may have as
much need of God another time: nay, you know not
what need you may have of him this present Parliament.
You cannot be ignorant of the many murmures and
more than whisperings of some desperate and devilish
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65552:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
conception suspected to be now in the womb of the
Jesuiticall faction: And, how neere it may be to the
birth, or how prodigious it may prove being born, I take
not upon me to divine: but this we are all sure of, that
what ever it be which they are big withall, it shall not
want the least graine of the utmost extremitie of malice
and mischiefe that all the wit, power, and industry of
Hell it self can contribute unto it; and, that they labour,
as a woman in travaile, to be speedily delivered of it.</p>
            <p>What dangers, and what cause of feare there may be
at the present, I leave to your Wisdome to consider.
But this be confident of, if Deliverances already recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
can prevaile with you for a <hi>Covenant,</hi> that Covenant
will be your securitie; for it will certainly engage all
the power and wisdome of the Great and only wise God
of heaven and earth to be on your side for ever. So that
if God himself have power enough, wisdome enough,
and care enough, you cannot miscarry; <hi>no weapon that is
formed against you shall prosper,</hi> no plot, <hi>no gates of hell shall
prevaile against you.</hi> And, if he have goodnesse enough,
mercy enough, bowels enow in him, he will then also,
raine down aboundance of trueth, righteousnesse, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
peace and plentie upon all Corners of the Land
from whence, and on whose errand, You are now come
together. Therefore it becomes you, above all others,
to be first in a <hi>Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Consider that,<note place="margin">2. There can be no full enjoying of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</note> till we do this, there cannot be such
a full enjoying of God, as otherwise there might be. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
the perfect fruition of God is not to be expected
till we come to heaven, but yet we might have much
more of God, even in this life, than now we have, could
we be perswaded to such a <hi>Covenant</hi> with him.</p>
            <p>Whatsoever experience we have of him now in any
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65552:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deliverance bestowed, it would be doubled, if, upon the
deliverance received, we would thus be <hi>joyned</hi> to him.
Nor is this a notion or conceit only, but a reall trueth.</p>
            <p>For, marke what He saith to his people, <hi>Hos. 2.
vers. 19, 20. I will marry thee unto me for ever, I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troath
thee unto me in righteousnesse, and in Iudgement,
and in loving kindnesse, and in mercies, I will even marry
thee unto me in faithfulnesse, and thou shalt know the Lord.</hi>
He that enters into Covenant with God, is <hi>betroathed,</hi>
yea even <hi>married</hi> to him: And how married? even to
the partaking of all his goods, of all he hath, yea of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and of all that he is. As the wife may say, <hi>Vbi tu
Caius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 31. 43.</note> 
               <hi>ego Caia;</hi> and, as <hi>Laban</hi> sometimes, of <hi>Iacobs</hi> wives,
children, and cattell, <hi>These daughters are my daughters,
and these children are my children, and these cattell are my
cattell, and all that thou seest are mine:</hi> So a man once
<hi>married</hi> to the Lord by <hi>Covenant,</hi> may without arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
say, this <hi>righteousnesse</hi> is my righteousnesse, this <hi>judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
is my judgement, this <hi>loving kindnesse, these mercies,
this faithfulnesse</hi> which I see in thee, and all that thou
hast is mine, for my comfort, supply, support, direction,
salvation, and what not?</p>
            <p>And take notice of that phrase, <hi>Thou shalt know the
Lord.</hi> Did they not <hi>know</hi> him before? Yes; but never
in such a manner, with such a <hi>Knowledge,</hi> at least in such a
measure. They shall now know him in such neere, fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar,
sweet and ineffable expressions of his deerest, deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est,
choycest conjugal love, as they never tasted, nor
could taste of before.</p>
            <p>We know how it is with a wife married to a loving
husband. They loved one another before marriage, and
many expressions of a speciall love passed betweene
them, but they never enjoyed one another fully till the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:65552:36"/>
marriage was solemnized. Then, there is not only a
more intimate manifestation of fervent, intire, loyall,
chaste love; but a further enlarging and stretching out
of mutuall affections to each other, than they could
possibly have beleeved they should ever have reached
unto, till now experience assure them of it. And even
thus it is between us and God. Is he Good in deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances?
have we tasted of his love already? Oh how
great would his goodnesse be, how full of grace, mercy,
bountie; and, how would he communicate even whole
rivers of all these to that Soule that would once come
up to him, and close with him in an <hi>everlasting Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant!
All the wayes of the Lord are mercy and trueth, unto
such as</hi> (make, and) <hi>keep Covenant with him, Psal.</hi> 25. 10.</p>
            <p>3. Consider that what ever worke God calls
You to,<note place="margin">3. No buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the worke God calls us unto, without a Covenant.</note> Yee will never buckle thoroughly to it, till you
have entred into <hi>Covenant</hi> with him. An apprentise boy
when he goes to a Master upon tryall onely, his minde is
now on, then off againe; sometimes he could like the
trade, by and by his minde hangs after his Mother
at home, or after some other course of life, and he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>never
sets close to his businesse, till he be bound.
When once the Indentures be sealed, and he enrolled,
he knowes there is now no more time to deliberate, but
he must fall to his busines, or else take what happens for
his idlenesse and negligence. So is it with a wife; if she
be but onely promised, or betroathed to a man, she may
come to his house, and cast an eye up and downe; but
it is rather to observe, than to act: she may perhaps cast
out a word now and then somewhat freely also; but she
never sets her selfe to guide the house, or to doe any

the things of the world;</hi> that is, with all possible diligence
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:65552:36"/>
looking to, and managing of the businesse of the family
committed to her, <hi>how she may please her husband:</hi> all her
thoughts, care, diligence run this way; she makes it
her businesse that she must stick unto, and daily manage
as a part of the marriage Covenant. And thus also it will
be with you. You have much worke under your hands,
and are likely to have more; and I hope you desire to
doe all in truth of heart, for God, and not for ends of
your owne: but let me tell you, this will never be done
throughly till once you be <hi>marryed</hi> to him by solemne
<hi>Covenant.</hi> Then, will you <hi>care indeed for the things of the
Lord, how you may please the Lord,</hi> in every cause, in every
Answer to any Petition, and in every Vote of any Bill,
or sentence. You would then think, when you come to
manage, debate, vote, any Question, <q>I am the Lords,
not mine owne, not my friends; will this I doe, stand
with my Covenant? will it please God? will it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
for the State? is it agreeable to Justice and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie?</q>
Then, on with it, no man shall divert, or take me
off. But, till then, one will entreate for his friend, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for his; one will make you one way, another would
draw you another way; and they are both your friends,
and you knowe not how to deny either: and thus are
you even torne in peeces betweene them, in so much as
you sometimes resolve to be absent, or to sit still and say
nothing; or, to gratifie him that hath most power with
You, be the Cause what it will. But when once the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
is sealed, all this will be at an end; You will
quickly stop your eares against all perswasions that may
hinder Justice and Reformation; and, when this is
known, men will soone forbeare also to trouble You
with such solicitations.<note place="margin">4. Wicked men Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with Hell.</note>

with our <hi>God</hi> to do his will, which will be beneficiall
and comfortable both here and hereafter,<note place="margin">Isay. 28.</note> and procure a

life, to flow in upon us!</p>
            <p>5.<note place="margin">5. The Devil himselfe will do no great matters for his vassals without a Covenant.</note> Consider that the Devill himself will have a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi>
from all his vassals that expect any extraordinary
matters from him; else, he will not be engaged to be at
their Command. There is not a Witch that hath the
Devill at her beck, but she must seale a Covenant to
him, sometimes with her bloud, sometimes by other
rites and devices, and perhaps he must suck her too (as
in those hellish bargaines you know they use;) and then,
he is for her, during the time agreed upon. And shall
we think God will be so cheap, as to be (with reverence
be it spoken) at our Command, to help, direct, assist, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
and save us, who will not do so much for him as
Witches and Sorcerers will do for the Devill?</p>
            <p>In the 45 of <hi>Isay,</hi> vers. 11. there is a strong expression
this way; <hi>Thus saith the Lord, the Holy one of Israel, and
his Maker, aske of mee things to come concerning my sonnes,
and concerning the work of my hands Command ye mee.</hi> It
is not to be thought that God complementeth with his
people, but is free and heartie in the expression of what
they shall really find him. But marke; it <hi>concernes his
Sonnes;</hi> that is, those that are truely in Covenant with
him. This priviledge is for none else. So that the way to
have God at <hi>Command,</hi> (with humilitie be it used) is to
be his <hi>sonnes</hi> and <hi>daughters</hi> by <hi>Covenant.</hi> For, to whom it
is said, <hi>I will be their God, and they shall be my people,</hi> to them
is it spoken, <hi>I will be a father unto you, and ye shall be my
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:65552:37"/>
sonnes and daughters, saith the Lord Almightie,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.
18. And to them he saith also, <hi>Command ye me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>6. Consider that it is the proper and chiefe businesse
of a <hi>Fast,</hi> to enter into <hi>Covenant</hi> with God. You see it
to be the practise of the Church in <hi>Nehemiah's</hi> time.<note place="margin">6. This is the proper worke of a Religious Fast.</note>
And where this hath been omitted, the <hi>Fast</hi> hath been
lost. God never accounted any of those foure annuall
solemne <hi>Fasts</hi> before mentioned,<note place="margin">Nehem. 9.</note> that were so long in
use among the Jews, to be <hi>fasts unto him;</hi> but calles them
<hi>fasts to themselves,</hi> Zach. 7. 5, 6. Why, but because they
looked no further in their Fasts,<note place="margin">Isay 58.</note> but <hi>to afflict their soules
for a day, to bow down their heads as a bullrush, and to spread
sack-cloth and ashes under them,</hi> and there an end. But
they lost all their labour, getting nothing from God but
a chiding, and contempt.</p>
            <p>And in trueth, when will we thus <hi>joyne</hi> our selves to
the Lord, if not at a <hi>Fast?</hi> Then, are our hearts in more
than ordinary tune for such a work, when we are brought
to set our sinnes before us, and humbly to confesse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile
and renounce them; when we have taken some
paines with our Soules to soften, and melt them before
the Lord; especially if then they be in any measure rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
up towards Him with any apprehension of his love
in the pardon of so many and great sinnes, even when
the Soule is most cast down for them. Then, I say strike
through the Covenant, or it will never be. If you let
slip this opportunitie, you may perhaps never obtaine
the like while you live; but either your selves may be
cut off, or your hearts shut up in desperate hardnesse, like
unto <hi>Pharoah,</hi> whom every deliverance, and new experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of Gods favour in taking off new evils, hardened
more, and made worse.</p>

7. In the last place (and let it not have the least force
of perswasion) remember and consider that this day,
even this very day, the 17. of <hi>November,</hi> 82. yeeres
sithence, began a new resurrection of this Kingdome
from the dead,<note place="margin">7. This very Day began the second Reformation of Religion.</note> our second happy Reformation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
by the auspitious entrance of our late Royal <hi>Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi>
(worthy of eternall remembrance and honour) into
her blessed and glorious Reigne; and that, from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth
Religion thrived, and prospered under her Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
with admirable successe, against a whole
world of oppositions from Popish factors at home and
abroad: So as the very Gates of hell were never able to
extinguish that Light, which God by her meanes hath
set up amongst us.</p>
            <p>Consider I beseech you, that it is not without a speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
Providence that this your meeting was cast upon this
very day (for, I presume, little did you think of the 17
of <hi>November,</hi> when you first fixed on this day for your
<hi>Fast;)</hi> that, even from thence, one hammer might be
borrowed to drive home this nayle of Exhortation; that
the very memory of so blessed a work begun on this very
day, might throughly inflame you with desire to enter
into a <hi>Covenant;</hi> and so, to go forward to perfect that
happy Reformation, which yet in many parts lyes unpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished
and unperfect.</p>
            <p>Oh suffer not that <hi>doore of hope</hi> by Her set open this
day, to be again shut, for want of a <hi>Covenant.</hi> If you
would indeed honour Her precious memory; yea, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
God and your selves, and not only continue the
possession of what she (as a most glorious Conduit pipe)
hath transmitted to us, but perfect the work; set upon
this duty of <hi>joyning your selves to the Lord in an everlasting
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:65552:38"/>
Covenant that shall not be forgotten.</hi> And so have you the
<hi>Motives.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. I shall now shut up all with some few <hi>Directions</hi> to
help us in it.<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Meanes</hi> how to enter into Covenant.</note> And here, passing by what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
spoken touching the <hi>preparatives</hi> to it, the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
of it, and the <hi>properties</hi> required in it, I shall only
give you these sixe subsequent <hi>Directions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. Give a Bill of divorce to all your Lusts,<note place="margin">1. Give a Bill of Divorce to all your Lusts.</note> or kill
them out-right. This Covenant is a marriage-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and there is no marrying with God, so long as
your former husband, your base corruptions, your
swearing, riot, drunkennesse, uncleannesse, pride, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression,
and what ever else your soules <hi>know to be the
plague of your own hearts,</hi> remaine alive and undivorced.
<hi>For the woman which hath an husband, is bound by the Law
to her husband so long as he liveth:</hi> but, if he be once <hi>dead,
she is free from that Law,</hi> Rom. 7. Therefore send these
packing, in the first place. A wise man will never marry
a strumpet, nor with any woman, that hath another hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band:
his wife that shall be only his own, none else shall
have interest in her. Much lesse then, will the Holy
and Jealous God admit of any Spouse that is wedded to
any lust, and so continueth. Say then, what wilt thou
now do? wilt thou still keep thy darling lust? Hast thou
been a swearer, and so thou wilt be? a drunkard, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
person, an oppressour, a prophane <hi>Esau,</hi> and wilt
be so still? Know, that God will none of thee, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horres
all such as thou art. He will admit none into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
but such as <hi>touch not the uncleane thing, but separate</hi>
from it.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 6.</note> To them only it is, that he promiseth, <hi>I will be
their God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. More especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cast out all <hi>Idols</hi> and <hi>Idolatry.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>and they shall be my people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. More especially purge out and cast away (as <hi>a Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struous
cloth)</hi> all <hi>Idols</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> in particular.<note place="margin">Psal. 5. 4.</note> All our
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:65552:39"/>
Lusts are lothsome to his stomach, but nothing is so abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
to his Soule, as <hi>Idolatry.</hi> This is that spirituall
whoredome which meritoriously dissolves the marriage
bond where it is already knit,<note place="margin">Meanes.</note> and lies as a barre in the
way to a Covenant with God,<note place="margin">Ier. 44. 4.</note> where yet it is not made.
This was it for which the Lord proceeded so severely,<note place="margin">2 Kin. 17.</note>
first against the ten Tribes, and then against the residue,
as you all know. For this, the Land spewed them out.
And where ever God promiseth to recall them, he usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
premiseth this, (which should first be done) <hi>From all
your Idols will I cleanse you, Ezek. 36. 25. Ephraim also shall
say, What have I to do any more with Idols? Hos.</hi> 14. 8. and
all shall cast them away with detestation, saying, <hi>Get thee
hence, Isay.</hi> 30. 22.</p>
            <p>Every Idol is that great <hi>Image of Iealousy,</hi> which the
Lord can by no meanes endure, and which will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be the destruction of King and People, where ever it
is entertained, especially if againe received in, after it
hath been once ejected. A sad example whereof we have
in <hi>Iudah,</hi> where, after <hi>Iosiah had taken away all the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
out of all the countries that pertained to Israel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chro, 34. 33.</note> 
               <hi>and
made all that were present in Israel to serve the Lord onely,</hi>
the Act of Resumption of Idols and Idolatry by the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
Kings (although it is probable they did it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<hi>secretly</hi> like those in 2 <hi>Kin. 17. 9.)</hi> became the ruine
of those Kings, and Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>Beloved, let me speake freely, for I speake for God,
and for all your safeties. You cannot be ignorant of the
grosse Idolatry daily encreasing among us, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
not (as adultery) in Corners onely, but in the
open light; people going to, and coming from the
Masse in great multitudes, and that as ordinarily, open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
confidently as others go to and from our Chnrches.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:65552:39"/>
And I doubt not but some of you doe know the number
of Masses to exceed that of Sermons.</p>
            <p>Whose heart bleeds not over this prodigious growth
of Popery and over flowing of Popish Masses? Who
knowes not, that in the Masse is committed the most
abominable Idolatry that ever the Sunne beheld in the
Christian world? Who remembers not with indignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and horror, how often that insatiable Idol hath bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it selfe in the bloud of many of our Ancestors and
Progenitors? And can any be so silly as to beleeve, that
it will rest satisfied till it swim againe in our bloud also;
unlesse we will joyne with Idolaters, and so perish in
Hell? For what ever some men talke of the possibility of
the salvation of some persons in that Church, (as they
call it) yet it is agreed on all hands, among us, that,
for those of our owne Nation and once of our owne
Church where the light hath so long shined in so much
brightnesse, so as they have both received &amp; professed
it; if they shall (whether to gratifie a Parent, a wife,
husband, friend, Master &amp;c.) put out their owne eyes,
and returne backe to <hi>Babylon</hi> from whence they were
once set free, their case is very desperate and dismall,
and <hi>it had been better for them never to have knowne
the way of righteousnesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.</note> 
               <hi>then after they have knowne it to
turne from the holy Commandement once delivered unto
them.</hi> Therefore I beseech you to take care of these a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
others.</p>
            <p>Nor speake I this, onely to prevent a publique tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
(which I hope, through the care of our Pious
King, and your diligence, our eyes shall never see) but
to put on Authority to the utter rooting out of that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination,
<note place="margin">2 Kin. 17. 9.</note> although committed in secret; and with
connivence onely.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:65552:40"/>
If then you will not halt betweene Two opinions, if
you will be thorough for God, and follow him fully,
downe with all <hi>Idols</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> through the Kingdome,
so farre as the making of the Lawes yet more strict and
full for that purpose, may effect it. Till then, you may,
if you will, talke of a <hi>Covenant,</hi> and thinke to doe great
matters: but that Great God who is so jealous of his
glory in that, above all other things, will abhorre all
Covenants with you. And if you, having now such op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
and power, shall not throughly cleanse the
Land of these spirituall whoredomes so boldly facing
and even out-facing the glorious Gospell professed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us; be sure, that, in stead of a blessing upon your
Consulations and proceedings, you will draw downe a
Curse that will cleave to you, and goe home with you,
and featter like poyson over all parts and Corners of
the Kingdome, till all be consumed and become a deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>You all I thinke, agree upon the necessity of a great
Reformation. Where should you begin then, but where
God ever begins? Looke into the Stories of <hi>Asa, Iehosa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat,
Hezekiah, Iosiah,</hi> and even of <hi>Manasseh</hi> himself, (the
grosseft Idolater and most bloudy Tyrant that ever
reigned in <hi>Iudah)</hi> when once God had throughly hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
him; and you shall ever finde that they began their
grand Reformation at <hi>Idols,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> committed
with them. I speake not this to backe or countenance
any tumultuous or seditious spirits that have lately been
stirred up to doe things without Commission; but to
You, whom God hath duely called to the worke, and
indispensibly requires it at your hands.<note place="margin">3. Execute true Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Execute true Iudgement</hi> and Justice. <hi>Loose the band
of wickednesse,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Isa. 58. 6.</note> 
               <hi>undoe the heavy burdens, let the oppressed goe
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:65552:40"/>
free, and break every yoke</hi> of the oppressor. This is a maine
part of an <hi>acceptable Fast,</hi> and therefore must be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
of all that will enter into Covenant with God.
And this was part of Gods Answer to the Jewes enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of the Prophet whether they should continue their
solemne Fasts? <hi>Zach.</hi> 7. Therefore herein deale im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially
and throughly, for hereby the Throne it felfe
is established. It is true, a difference must be put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
those that are only led on in evill wayes by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and those that are leaders of others: but it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
not me to prescribe to you in this case, your own
wisdome will teach you that. Only I am to pray you,
that if you shall find any escapes to have been made in
the Ordinary Courts of Justice, in the condigne punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Murder,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry,</hi> take notice of them, and
there be sure to strike home, as <hi>Samuel</hi> did where <hi>Saul</hi>
himselfe had been too indulgent. There is nothing
makes you such faire Images of God (in the relation you
now stand) as due execution of Justice and Judgement.
Therefore, if you will indeed enter into a Covenant, let
this be done.</p>
            <p>4. Do your best to draw as many others as you can
the same way.<note place="margin">4. Draw others also.</note> Parents and Masters are bound to take
care that their children and families do feare, and serve
God, as well as themselves. And You who now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
before him in behalf of the kingdome, as you must
enter into a Covenant for them as well as for your
selves, so must you do your utmost that they also for
themselves may passe under the same Covenant, with
you. The representative Body of Israel that stood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord to make a Covenant, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 15. made
it not only for themselves and such as were present, but
for all that were <hi>absent</hi> also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And <hi>Iosiah</hi> when he entred
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:65552:41"/>
into a Covenant himself, he not only caused <hi>all that were
present of Iudah at the house of the Lord,</hi> to stand to it,
2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34. 32. But he <hi>made all Israel to serve, even to serve
the Lord their God,</hi> vers. 33. that is, to strike a Covenant
with him. Therefore take care that all others, when
you returne home, may make a Covenant before the
Lord to walk after him in all his Commandements: that
God may be set up more and more, and the hearts of all
men may be lifted up in the wayes of the Lord to take
hold of his Covenant also. If you do not this, you do
nothing: for more is required at your hands, than of
private persons, who yet are bound to call upon others
(as the men in my Text) saying, <hi>Come and let us joyne our
selves unto the Lord in an everlasting Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. Would you have this to be done,<note place="margin">5. Set up Way-markes to <hi>Zion.</hi>
               </note> namely, that all
should <hi>appeare before God in Zion,</hi> for this purpose? Then
set up <hi>Way-markes</hi> to direct them thither. Take speciall
care that the Ordinances of God be set up, and held up,
in more puritie, and plentie. Down at once with all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions
and fancies of men, which corrupt and adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the pure worship of God. Let none but He be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped,
and let no worship be thrust upon him which
himselfe hath not prescribed. Herein especially (yet
still within your bounds) be zealous, and quit your
selves like men.</p>
            <p>Above all, take better order for the more frequent,
and better performance, and due countenancing of that
now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vilified (but highly necessary) Ordinance of Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching,
which, albeit it be Gods own arme and power
unto salvation, is yet brought into so deep contempt
(and by none more than by those who should labour
most to hold up the honour of it) that it is made a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

            </p>
            <p>Wherefore I dare pronounce, that while so many
thousands within the Kings Dominions, especially in
<hi>England, Wales,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> are still suffered to <hi>sit in
such darknesse and in the shadow of death,</hi> and so to perish
for ever for want of constant, sound, profitable Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
it is impossible that they should be capable of a
Covenant with God; or, that it may be truely said,
that the maine body of these Kingdomes are in case to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:65552:42"/>
make a Covenant with him; unlesse you, the Represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative
Body thereof, take more care than ever yet hath
been taken in this behalfe.</p>
            <p>I know the many plea's of many idle droanes and
mercilesse men to excuse and defend an unpreaching,
or seldome-preaching Ministry; but all their fig-leaves
are too short to cover their own shame, and the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of those poore perishing people whom such men
make naked, to their own destruction also.</p>
            <p>To tell us, that preaching indeed is necessary for the
planting of a Church, but not so afterwards: is nothing
but to bewray their owne sottish ignorance. Is not the
word preached,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2. 2.</note> the <hi>milk</hi> and food whereby men are, and
must be continually nourished <hi>to grow</hi> up in the body of
Christ,<note place="margin">Ephes. 4.</note> as well as the <hi>Seed</hi> whereof they are first begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
unto Christ?<note place="margin">Iam. 1. 18.</note> And can men that are born,<note place="margin">1 Pet 1. 23.</note> and living,
live safely, or at all, without continuall supply of food
convenient for them?</p>
            <p>What fearefull trifling is this in a businesse of such
high Concernment! Good <hi>Iehoshaphar,</hi> when <hi>his heart
was</hi> once <hi>lift up in the wayes of the Lord,</hi> tooke other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:
for, he sent not only some of the prime <hi>Levites</hi>
and <hi>Priests,</hi> who <hi>taught in Iudah and had the Book of the
Law of the Lord with them, and went about through all the
Cities of Iudah and taught the people, 2 Chron.</hi> 17. 8, 9. but
with them, he sent divers of his <hi>Princes and chiefe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
Benhail, Obadiah,</hi> and sundry others, to see that
this work should be effectually done, <hi>vers.</hi> 7. yea (as
our late Translation hath it) <hi>he sent to them to teach in the
Cities of Iudah:</hi> that is, that they should take as much
care of the businesse, by putting on the Priests and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,
as if they themselves in person were bound to do
all the worke. And hence it was, that God gave this
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65552:42"/>
testimony of <hi>Iehoshaphat,</hi> that <hi>he walked in the first wayes
of his father David,</hi> vers. 3. that <hi>he had riches and honour
in abundance,</hi> vers. 5. and that <hi>the feare of the Lord fell
upon all the Kingdomes of the Land round about Iudah, so
that they made no warre against Iehoshaphas,</hi> vers. 10. So
that, beside the spirituall benefit, a Preaching Ministry
is one of the best advantages to secure a State; it is (you
see) not only an hedge, but <hi>walles and Bulwarks</hi> unto any
Kingdome.</p>
            <p>And yet, as many of our blind guides and Idol Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards
care not to erect Preaching where there is none,
so doe they all they can to cheat and defraud those of it
who doe or would enjoy it, sometimes by pulling it
downe where it is set up, and (to fill up the measure of
their wickednesse) glorying in it, when they have done;
sometimes by striking out the teeth of it, that if men
will needes preach, yet it shall be to little purpose; one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
a frigid, toothlesse, saplesse discourse, never pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
deeper than the eare. If the Preacher come home
to convince the Conscience of particulars that need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
(which yet was the old course, and should be
so still) the Preacher is either derided as worthy of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but contempt, or else censured as indiscreet, rash,
factious, and seditious.</p>
            <p>And least men should surfeit of preaching, how be all
Sermons, in the afternoones of the Lord's dayes, cryed
downe, as the markes of Iudaizing Puritanisme, and as
a burden intolerable to the people!</p>
            <p>Indeed, it is true, that when Authority first command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the afternoones Sermon to be converted into <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chising,</hi>
there was not onely no hurt done, but a wise
and needfull course prescribed for the best edifying of
popular Auditories. But as some have handled the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:65552:43"/>
it is now become a great hindrance to edification.
If a Minister would carefully and solidly open the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
heads of Catechisme, confirme them by Scripture,
and bring them home by some short and familiar appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
most sutable to vulgar eares and Capacities; I
hold it simply the most profitable exercise (at least for
one part of the day) that can be set up for the increase
of sound knowledge and Piety: and pity it is that this is
so much neglected. <hi>But this,</hi> say our new Masters, <hi>is worse
than preaching.</hi> Therefore they enjoyne all to keep one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the bare Questions and Answers of the <hi>Chila's</hi>
Catechisme. And if any presume to adde any exposition
or instruction, he is by some hurried from post to pillar,
and censured as a pernitious Malefactor.</p>
            <p>And as they have thus thrust all preaching (be it but
Catecheticall) out of the Church in the afternoones of
the Lords day, so have they shut divers able, godly, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet
Pastors out of their owne Pulpits on the weeke
dayes, even in Populous Townes, where the Ministers
were willing to bestow their paines, (and so for many
yeares with great fruit and comfort to the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
had done) <hi>gratis,</hi> for the refreshing of many hungry
Soules who had no preaching at home in their owne Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,
and dare not stirre thence on the Lords day to
seeke it abroad.</p>
            <p>Nay, some of your Cathedrall Men are come to that
passe, that when any Sermon (such as it is) is preached
in the Cathedrall or Collegiate Church, no Sermon
must then be preached in the Parish Church or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
adjoyning, meerely to uphold the pompe and State
of the Greater Church, and for feare of lessening the
Auditory, or diminishing the honour of the Preacher,
(who many times deserves little enough) where as not
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65552:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a fourth part of the Congregation (by this meanes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded
of Preaching in the Parish Church) can possibly
come within hearing, or ken of the Cathedrall Pulpit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
            <p>Oh Beloved! are these, wayes to set forth Christ to
the people for their salvation, to display God, in all his
glorious Attributes and Perfections, and to bring them
within view of the beauties and Excellencies of God in
his Covenant and Communion with his people, so as
to draw them to a Covenant! Nay hence, hence
it comes to passe that God is extremely dishonoured,
his Name blasphemed, his day abominably prophaned,
and his people run headlong (like beasts to the Sham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles)
by droves, to Popery, Anabaptisme, Familisme,
Atheisme, and what not, that may cast, and lock them
under the hatches of everlasting damnation.</p>
            <q>
               <l>—Quis talia fando,</l>
               <l>Temperet a lachrymis?—</l>
            </q>
            <p>I know that some of those Step-fathers and hard-hearted
Wretches, who be indeed the chiefe (if not
the onely) cause of all this, blush not to attribute the
daily falling off of multitudes from our Church, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-much
Preaching: but this is as rationall, as was his
mad opinion touching Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>much learning had
made him mad.</hi> These are crying Abominations, that
will cry as loud against you, as now they doe against the
Authors of them, if you reforme them not.</p>
            <p>Wonder not at my length, and heate in this point. It
is a matter of greatest Consequence, and of all other
most proper for a Preacher to be zealous in. And give
me leave to tell you, that this must be put in the head of
the Catalogue of your weightiest Consultations at this
time, if you desire ever to draw the people of this &amp; the
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:65552:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
minions into any Covenant and Communion with God,
or to setle any thing for the good of your selves and
countryes.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Iames</hi> indeed took commiseration of the grosse
ignorance of multitudes in the North parts of this
Kingdome, and sent some Preachers at his owne charge
among them. A Pious and a Noble worke! But what
through the unsetled wandrings, idlenesse, the super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
and unprofitable performances of some of these
Preachers, and what through the supine negligence of
some in Authoritie who should have looked better to
those itinerary Ministers, most of that labour and charge
was little better than lost. For, some of you know, that
in no parts of the Kingdome hath there been such an
increase of Papists, as in those very Corners, where that
sleight meanes was used to reduce men from Popery.</p>
            <p>I beseech you therefore by all the mercies of God, by
all the Bowels of Christ in shedding of his deerest bloud
for those precious Soules, who now, even by thousands
and millions miserably perish in their ignorance and sins,
that you would carefully reforme, or cast out all idle,
unsound, unprofitable, and scandalous Ministers; and
provide a sound, godly, profitable and setled Preaching
Ministry in every Congregation through the Land and
the annexed Dominions; and, to take no lesse care for
their diligent and constant performance of their dutie
both in life and Doctrine, as also for their liberall main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
(that may be still capable of improvement, as
the times grow harder, and commodities deerer) that
both themselves who preach the Gospel, and all theirs
also, may cheerefully and comfortably live of the
Gospel. And let us once see <hi>Zion built up,</hi> by your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
<hi>in perfect beautie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:65552:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Lastly, When you set upon this great businesse of a
<hi>Covenant,</hi> see that you do it out of <hi>love</hi> to God, and with
all your heart: else, it will come to nothing. If you
would to <hi>Zion, your faces</hi> must be set, and setled <hi>thither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi>
If you would make a <hi>Covenant,</hi>
               <note place="margin">When a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is to be made, do it with all the heart; and forget it not when it is made.</note> you must not be
unwilling, afraid, ashamed to be accounted such <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanters,</hi>
but do it with a steddy, open, undaunted coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and resolution. You must <hi>love the name of your
God to be his servants, Isay</hi> 56. 6. You have seen how <hi>Asa</hi>
and all his Kingdome did it; they both entred into Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
and they <hi>swore it, with all their heart, and sought
him with their whole desire,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chro. 15. 15.</note> 
               <hi>and
he was found of them, and
gave them rest round about.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus if you do, God shall be set up, Religion advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
your grievances removed, you shall heare no more
such complainings in our streets. All blessings shall
follow, not your selves alone, but the whole Kingdome,
in our King and his Government, in your Consultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and proceedings, in the publique, setled, and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Peace, and prosperitie of both Church and State.
The blessings of the Earth, in the Citie, the field, your
bodies, posteritie, in all your goings out and comings
in; The blessings of heaven in the meanes of Grace, the
beginnings and growth in grace, the light of Gods
countenance which is better than life; and, after all,
even the fulnesse of both grace and glory in the full,
cleare, and eternall fruition of God himselfe in the
highest heavens, shall all compasse, and Crowne you
for ever.</p>
            <p>Provided alwayes, that when once this Covenant is
made, you take care that <hi>it never be forgotten,</hi> but heeded,
minded, and performed; that as you close with God, so
you may alwayes continue with him. Then shall this
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65552:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whole nation and the children which are yet unborne
praise and blesse the Lord for ever for this Parliament,
and your endeavours in it. But I feele my self spent, and
therefore must desist, yet with this hope, that my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
fellow-labourer designed for the other part of
this worke, will begin where<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I leave, and set
on with more strength what my weakness
is not able to performe.</p>
