            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

cloaths. And how hee came to himself again, when hee was in the grave, as
appeared when hee was taken up, by the sad consequences of his strugling and
striving to get out of the Coffin, his arms being beaten black and blew, his
head bruised and swell'd as big as two heads, and his eyes starting almost out
of his head; It being also certainly reported, that he was heard to utter many
grievous shrieks and groans the time he lay under ground, which was from Friday
night, June 21. to Monday morning, June 24. 1661.</head>

               <l>They found him lying on the bed</l>
               <l>his cloaths were <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â€¢</desc>
                  </gap>n, his eyes
  were shut:</l>
               <l>No motion from the foot to head,</l>
               <l>which them into amazement put.</l>
               <l>And all concluded certainly</l>
               <l>his life was past recovery.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The Searchers then came up, and view'd</l>
               <l>his body o're in every place:</l>
               <l>And to the people then they shew'd,</l>
               <l>what was their iudgement in that case.</l>
               <l>Their Uerdict was, that cruel Death</l>
               <l>had by a Quinsey stopt his breath.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>His Landlady through covetousnesse</l>
               <l>to gain his cloaths I understand:</l>
               <l>Did make it her great businesse</l>
               <l>to bury him quickly out of hand.</l>
               <l>A shallow Grave was dig'd with spÃ©ed</l>
               <l>and he therein was laid indÃ©ed.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But ah! what groans he uttered</l>
               <l>as some report for verity:</l>
               <l>For as it sÃ©emes he was not dead,</l>
               <l>but only in a trance did lye.</l>
               <l>And coming to himself again</l>
               <l>he did endure most grievous pain.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>With head and fÃ©et, and arms he wrought,</l>
               <l>so long as any strength remain'd:</l>
               <l>Most earnestly for life he sought,</l>
               <l>which could by no means be obtain'd.</l>
               <l>For being underneathe the ground</l>
               <l>to save his life no way was found.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>From <hi>Friday night</hi> till <hi>Monday morn</hi>
               </l>
               <l>he lay in earth imprisoned:</l>
               <l>Disconsolate and quite forlorn,</l>
               <l>untill his breath was smothered.</l>
               <l>And then when as the time was past,</l>
               <l>they dig'd him out o'th grave at last.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>His Coffin opened was, wherein</l>
               <l>a dolefull sight they then beheld:</l>
               <l>With strugling he had bruis'd his skin,</l>
               <l>his head and eyes were sadly sweld.</l>
               <l>His body over black and blew,</l>
               <l>as many do report for true.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>His Landlord and his Landlady</l>
               <l>being suspected for this dÃ©ed:</l>
               <l>Examined were most certainly</l>
               <l>and unto <hi>Newgate</hi> sent with spÃ©ed</l>
               <l>And till themselves they well can clear,</l>
               <l>it is suppos'd they must lye there.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now let us all with one consent</l>
               <l>turn to the Lord with heart and mind:</l>
               <l>And of our grievous sins repent,</l>
               <l>that so we may Gods mercy find,</l>
               <l>And to conclude to God let's call,</l>
               <l>from such a death Lord kÃ©ep us all.</l>
