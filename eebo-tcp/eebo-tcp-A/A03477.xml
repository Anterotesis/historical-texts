            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWERE TO THE HOLLAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders Declaration concerning the Occurrents of the Eaſt-India.</head>
            <p>THere was of late two Currants publiſhed, bearing date, the one, the 8. of February, the other, the 28. In theſe two Currants ſundry, both incredible and intollerable wrongs and grieuances were made knowne, which the Hollanders of the Eaſt-Indies had inflicted and enforced vpon the Engliſh company of the Eaſt-Indies. Sithence the printing of theſe two Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, the Hollanders haue publiſhed a Pamphlet entituled, <hi>A declaration of the affaires of the Eaſt-Indies.</hi> This declaration was publiſhed (as by the diſcourſe may appeare) in anſwer of the two Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants aboue mentioned, for the whole ſcope of the declaration tendeth to no other end, but to iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their owne right in the Eaſt-Indies, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon to charge the Engliſh with wrongs done to them, that thereby the world might be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue that whatſoeuer extremities or hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures they offered to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they were vrged and prouoked thereunto by the vniuſt dealing of the Engliſh, and the wrongs firſt offered by them: How ſoeuer the Engliſh prouoked the Hollanders in India, the Hollanders by this declaration doe vrge and prouoke the Engliſh to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues againſt ſo falſe and fabulous ſlanders impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed vpon them. Is it not too much that the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> moſt vniuſtly oppreſſed vs in India, but that
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4344:3"/>
they muſt proceede further to ſlander vs in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> They ſpoyled vs of our goods in forraigne parts, and now they practice to depriue vs from all hope of reliefe in our owne Countrey? What reliefe &amp; remedy can we expect, if by our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert and prouocation wee drew and vrged the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> to practice what they did vpon vs. Where puniſhment is deſerued the offenders are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and their complaints contemned: It is an old Prouerbe, <hi>Giue loſers leaue to ſpeake;</hi> Our loſſes are without compare, to loſe our liues and liberty, to loſe our goods, to loſe our trade and trafficke, and now laſtly in our owne Countrey to loſe the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt reputation of men, of Engliſhmen, of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Merchants, of the Engliſh company of Eaſt-India. This is a loſſe irrecouerable, as an Heathen Hiſtorian writeth; <hi>Maiora ſunt fame &amp; fidei dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, quam que ſarciri poſſunt:</hi> The loſſe of a good name, the loſſe of truſt and credit are loſſes irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerable. But thanks bee to Almightie God who doth alwayes protect the innocent: This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> entended and publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed for our vtter vn doing and diſgrace, offereth vnto vs in two reſpects both hope and helpe, ſo that wee may ſay to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> as the prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Chriſtians ſaid of <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſtata; <hi>Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem nocendi habes, poteſtatem auiem non habes Iuli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ani:</hi> We vnderſtand your intents O <hi>Hollanders,</hi> to ouerthrow vs, but you want power, wee doe not meane your Sea power (which is too potent) but we meane of your malice, which is by the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God vtterly confounded: if in this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of yours, your will and malice had ioyned
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4344:3"/>
in equall power, wee the oppreſſed Engliſh might haue for borne to haue complained of our wrongs, with ſhame &amp; confuſion; of whom or what ſhould we complaine, if our ſelues vrged, prouoked and deſerued our owne misfortunes. But as wee haue ſaid, thanks bee to Almighty God, who hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted <hi>Hamon</hi> his Gallowes entended againſt <hi>Mordocheus,</hi> to his owne confuſion, like as he hath ſuffered you to publiſh a Declaration to cut your owne throats: what could you deuiſe to write and publiſh more oppoſite to what you intended, more to diſgrace your ſelues in conuincing you of falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, more to honor, acquite and cleere the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh then this Declaration? All which ſhall manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtly appeare in the examination of your declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which followeth.</p>
            <p>To begin with the very firſt lines and page, you affirme, that all the Ilands of <hi>Banda</hi> from the tenth of Auguſt 1609. were by a ſpeciall Treaty and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement made with the <hi>Orange Cayus</hi> the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of the Ilands, put vnder the protection of the States of Netherlands: how vntrue this is, let all men iudge, when as you confeſſe in the latter end of the firſt page, and in the beginning of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, were afterward broken and violated; And that the Ilanders withheld their fruits and ſpices, that they enforced &amp; robbed their Ware-houſes, murthered at ſundry times and places diuers of the principall Officers, committies, and ſeruants of the Netherlands company, taking away their ſhips &amp; prouiſion, what could the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ſay leſſe then to pretend an agreement? and what or how could alledge &amp; proue more directly to conuince them ſelues of vntruth then ſo plainly &amp; largely confeſſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4344:4"/>
the recited hoſtilities, practiſed by the <hi>Bandineſes</hi> againſt them: what an agreement could this bee where there was ſo great an auerſion of the Ilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders mindes, declared by the hoſtile deeds which they practiſed againſt the Hollanders, they might perhaps ſay, there was a Treatie; but ſuch hoſtile practices manifeſtly proue there could bee no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement.</p>
            <p>The Hollanders proceede further, from the yeer 1609. to the yeere 1616. where they ſpeake of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agreement concluded in May, by one of the Netherlanders Commanders called <hi>Lam.</hi> And another agreement made by their Gouernour Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall called <hi>Reall,</hi> in the yeere 1617. which they confeſſe were both ſhortly after broken by the <hi>Bandineſes,</hi> but how? Here commeth in the maine matter, the <hi>Bandineſes</hi> rebelled through the animating of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who did openly ayd and aſſiſt them with victuals, munition, great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, men, and ſhips.</p>
            <p>In this ſecond Page here are ſtrange wrongs of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> by the <hi>Bandineſes</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> nay, to God himſelfe, of which wee muſt firſt ſpeake.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Bandineſes</hi> enforced Chriſtians to turne Moores againe. Firſt, let vs aske you who conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe turne-coate Chriſtians, did you? Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit you did. Next let vs aske you to what kinde of Chriſtianity did you conuert them, if to that kinde of Chriſtianity to which one <hi>Chircke,</hi> the Maſter of a Ship called the <hi>Sampſon,</hi> which you wrongfully tooke from the Engliſh, the offence of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:4344:4"/>
the <hi>Bandineſes</hi> was the leſſe, if they compelled the inhabitants to forſake ſuch Chriſtianity, for your owne Countrey men in the Eaſt-Indies doe and did openly &amp; ieſtingly confeſſe that <hi>Chircke</hi> was a Cuckold before he was a Chriſtian, for being mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in <hi>Holland,</hi> hee left his wife with his familiar friends, who did out of their familiar loue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the family in the Husbands abſence; It was two or three yeers after that <hi>Chircke</hi> was chriſtned. Such Chriſtians may quickly turne Moores who delay Baptizing till thirty fiue. But to returne to the heauy burden with which the Engliſh are charged; namely, to animate, to aide and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the <hi>Bandineſes,</hi> it were neceſſary that the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> ſhould ſet downe the cauſes which moued the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to ioyne ſo ſarre with the <hi>Bandineſes,</hi> for the cauſes doe either leſſon or agrauate the charge impoſed vpon the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> they muſt either ſay the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ayded the <hi>Bandineſes</hi> directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Hollanders</hi> without further reſpect, which they cannot proue, or they muſt alleadge, which themſelues in their Declaration, doe proue that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did endeauour to defend them with whom they had free trade and trafficke, who louingly and with free conſent ſold to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> their ſpices, &amp;c. who put themſelues vnder the protection of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who yeelded the Ilands of <hi>Polawaye, Polerone</hi> and <hi>Lantore,</hi> vnder the obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of the King of <hi>England,</hi> which if they would they cannot deny, for they confeſſe that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> had mounted ordinance vpon all theſe Ilands: why ſhould the <hi>Engliſh</hi> plant their ordinance vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:4344:5"/>
theſe Ilands but to defend their right. How could the <hi>Engliſh</hi> plant their Ordinance vpon the Ilands but with free conſent of the <hi>Bandineſſes,</hi> at what time did the <hi>Engliſh</hi> plant their Ordinance in theſe Ilands of <hi>Banda?</hi> The <hi>Hollanders</hi> confeſſe before they came to the Ilands; for they found them in the Ilands: now where is the wrong that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> haue done the <hi>Hollanders?</hi> and in what becauſe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> did hinder the agreements ſo often made betwixt the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and the <hi>Bandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,</hi> why for eleuen yeares the <hi>Hollanders</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe there was neuer any, as in the third page they ſay: In this wilfulneſſe did the <hi>Bandineſſes</hi> continue till in Iune 1620. Thus hitherto it is plainely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the <hi>Hollanders</hi> neuer had any lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, any Caſtle or Fort, any trading in the Ilands of <hi>Banda,</hi> but what was gotten by force and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute conſtraint: If the <hi>Hollanders</hi> could proue ſo much for themſelues as they doe for the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> then might haue bluſhed for ſhame. In all this time that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> maintained ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility with the <hi>Bandineſſes</hi> there is no mention made that the <hi>Bandineſſes</hi> euer offered any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or once denied them their Spices, but that they had trade and trafficke with them freely and friendly, now if conſent and preſcription of time be the beſt claime the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> would haue for the Ilands of <hi>Banda,</hi> why the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> go farre beyond them, the <hi>Bandineſſes</hi> did neuer violate any agreement made with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they neuer kept any pretended agreement made with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> in eleuen
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:4344:5"/>
yeeres were neuer expelled, the <hi>Hollanders</hi> in all that time were neuer entertained, but in all hoſtile manner: The <hi>Engliſh</hi> men had offer at all times of Nutmegs and Mace, ſo had the <hi>Hollanders</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer at any time, but what they got by violence and compulſion; all which is acknowledged in the third Page, and the beginning of the fourth. We paſſe ouer many acknowledgements and confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> becauſe they all tend but to two ends, to iuſtifie themſelues, and condemne the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and becauſe there is ſufficient obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation giuen, that in iuſtifying themſelues, they diſgrace themſelues, and in practiſing to diſgrace the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they doe them great honor. But to deale plainely and truely, not to abuſe the world with vntruths, nor to wrong the <hi>Hollanders</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cauſe, we doe confeſſe; The <hi>Bandineſes</hi> made one famous agreement with the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> which wee well remember, euen in that yeere in which they report they had made agreement with the <hi>Bandineſes.</hi> In Iune 1609. after they had by force taken from them a Towne called <hi>Noara,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them flye to the backeſide of the coaſt, to a place which they called <hi>Naſſaw. Van Hofe</hi> the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall made ſhew of loue &amp; friendſhip with the <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſes,</hi> which they perceiuing and deſirous to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge the wrongs and cruelties offered vnto them by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> did diſſemble their intents, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining <hi>Van Hoofe</hi> with vaine hopes, promiſing him to come to ſome agreement, by which meanes they drew <hi>Van Hoofe</hi> with three ſcore or more of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:4344:6"/>
his Commanders and Souldiers vnto a place in which the <hi>Bandineſes</hi> had aduantage. Now inſteed of agreement, in warlike manner they ſet vpon <hi>Van Hoofe</hi> and ſlew him and almoſt his company. This is the beſt agreement that wee euer knew or heard the <hi>Bandineſes</hi> euer made with the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> during a leauen or twelue yeeres. Preſently after this, in Iuly after, Captaine <hi>Bitter</hi> who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all the Commanders eſcaped, when <hi>Van Hoofe</hi> was ſlaine, attempted to ſupprize another Towne caled <hi>Slamma;</hi> hee was ſought withall by the <hi>Bandineſes,</hi> and wounded in the thigh, of which wound he ſhortly dyed.</p>
            <p>Now it appeareth manifeſtly without denyall vpon this former examination of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> declaration that the right to the Hands of <hi>Banda</hi> was principally yeelded by free conſent of the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers, confirmed by many yeeres trade and traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficke without any oppoſition in any hoſtile man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but with mutuall enter courſe of all loue and amity.</p>
            <p>This the <hi>Hollanders</hi> doe confeſſe, and what proofe can be more pregnant then the teſtimony of an aduerſary: Where is now any wrong which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> hath done the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> except it bee a wrong to maintaine them, who with free and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall conſent put themſelues vnder the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the King of <hi>England?</hi> or a wrong to defend them who willingly trafficke and trade with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> or a wrong to maintaine that right which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> acknowledge the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:4344:6"/>
the Iland of <hi>Banda:</hi> Theſe be all the wrongs which the <hi>Hollanders</hi> doe or can charge the Engliſh withall.</p>
            <p>But now on the other ſide, what extreame wrongs doe the <hi>Engliſh</hi> charge vpon the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders?</hi> In two Currants printed the eight of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and the twenty eight 1629. the <hi>Hollanders</hi> are charged with moſt barbarous and inhumane wrongs done to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> all which they paſſe ouer in their Declaration without any anſwere at all, whereby in ſilence they cannot but pleade guilty: to confeſſe them they are a ſhamed, and to deny them they cannot, but in their accuſtomed pollicy they ſeeke to auoyd them by way of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> deſerued them in ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and aſſiſting the <hi>Bandineſes</hi> againſt them.</p>
            <p>There were two Orators of <hi>Athens</hi> very great and inward friends, before the Iudges the one did accuſe, the other defend a Magiſtrate of <hi>Athens,</hi> whereupon the one Orator did challenge the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that he had dealt very vnkindly with him to defend his mortall enemy, and thou as vnkindly with me, quoth the other, to accuſe my deareſt friend.</p>
            <p>This is iuſt the like challenge betwixt the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> Why doe you ſay the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> defend our greateſt enemies? And why doe you ſay the <hi>Engliſh</hi> oppoſe againſt our deareſt friends? Yet in this challenge there is a difference, for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> haue more cauſe to defend their friends, then the <hi>Hollanders</hi> haue cauſe to oppoſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:4344:7"/>
againſt their enemies, <hi>Engliſh</hi> men haue a right by conſent, <hi>Hollanders</hi> haue nothing but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint.</p>
            <p>Iuſt defence is more honeſt and honourable then vniuſt oppoſition is, either by Lawes of God or man warrantable.</p>
            <p>To proceede on with the cruell, and inhumane wrongs done by the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by ſo much more barbarous and inhumane, by how much the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of all Nations in the world, did leaſt deſerue it. What? deſerue any hard mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures from the <hi>Hollanders?</hi> To what Nation vnder the Coape of Heauen, are they ſo much bound as to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who hath foſtered and nurſed them vp to this greatneſſe, but the <hi>Engliſh?</hi> what Nation hath ſhed ſo much blood, loſt the the liues of ſo many gallant Captaines, Commanders, and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, to ayde and defende them as the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What Nation hath lent them, and ſpent vpon them ſo much money and treaſure, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> haue done, when they were in their extreemeſt weakneſſe, and pouerty? when and where did the <hi>Engliſh</hi> euer fayle them. If for theſe cauſes, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> haue deſerued at the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> hands, to haue their ſhippes taken, and made prize, their goods confiſcate, and conuerted to their owne vſes, their Captaines, Souldiers, Factors, &amp; Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, taken priſoners, held in miſerable ſeruitude, clogged with yorns, kept in ſtockes, bound hand and foote, tied to ſtakes, haling, and pulling them
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:4344:7"/>
with ropes about their neckes, ſpurning them like dogges, throwing them headlong downe rockes and clifts, killing, murthering, ſtaruing, and pining them to death, enforcing them to carry lime, and ſtone for their buildings. Landing them amongſt the Pagan people, without all prouiſion whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, expoſing them to the mercy of miſcreants of whom notwithſtanding they ſound better vſage then of the <hi>Hollanders.</hi> When as the <hi>Hollanders</hi> robbed, and ſpoyled other Nations vnder the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> coulers, pretending to diſgrace the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that they were <hi>Engliſh</hi> men, counterfeiting the coyne of other nations, charging the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with the ſame. Laying the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whom they held as priſoners aboue hatches, where the Sunne ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched them in the day, and where their ordutes and piſle fell vpon them in the night, till they grew more loathſome and filthie then Leapers, barring the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> as much as in them lay, from all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſe and trade in the Indies. As all theſe perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars are directly to be proued by men yet liuing, who either endured, or their eyes ſaw, what is heare reported, and will be ready vpon all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons either with their liues or oathes to iuſtifie for truth, what they haue endured, and what they haue ſeene with their eyes.</p>
            <p>Let all the world iudge whether <hi>Engliſh</hi> men haue deſerued theſe vſages, at the <hi>Hollanders</hi> hands: VVhere as ſome people either affected to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> or thinking it to ſtrange, and monſterous, that Chriſtians ſhould domineare
