            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE Priviledges of this Vniversity have been in so full, clear, and expressive words, granted to our Predecessours; and have since been us'd here with so much moderation, and prudence; That we, their successours, might with reason have expected rather the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of <hi>enjoying</hi> them, than the trouble of <hi>maintaining</hi> them. But so it happens, That those very rights, which were designedly given to the Vniversity, as the best means of securing our <hi>peace,</hi> and <hi>quiet,</hi> have frequently, by the malice of our Adversaries, been made the occasions of our <hi>disturbance.</hi> Once at least in every age, The Citizens have renew'd their complaints against us; which have all equally been founded on <hi>no reason</hi>; and consequently have all alike met with <hi>no success.</hi> It is remarkable, that nothing hath formerly been more <hi>beneficial</hi> to us, than these groundless complaints of the City; and that to <hi>these</hi> chiefly we <hi>owe</hi> almost all those Charters, which we now enjoy. For when this contentious humour of the Citizens did thus in an unaccountable manner discover it self, in the reigns of <hi>Ed. 3</hi>d. <hi>Hen. 4</hi>th. <hi>Hen. 8</hi>th. and <hi>Car. 1</hi>st. it did not only justify the prudence of their Ancestours in granting us our ancient rights; but convinc'd those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb facs="tcp:100139:3"/>
Princes of a farther necessity of giving greater, and more <hi>unquestionable</hi> Priviledges. Thus have we been oblig'd to <hi>their bad manners</hi> for <hi>our good laws</hi>; and do faithfully keep an exact register of their <hi>contentions,</hi> by the date of our <hi>Charters.</hi> We have publish'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these two following Treatises; not only out of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect</hi> to our selves; but out of <hi>kindness</hi> to the City: For when once the most sober, and judicious part of them shall be convinc'd, That their demands are unreasonable, and unjust; That some turbulent Men, under the popular pretence of defending the rights of the City, do only car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on their own designs, and interest, at the publick charge; It is impossible to conceive, That the Citizens will still be impos'd on; and not find some better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for <hi>their,</hi> or ratber (as it originally was) for <hi>our</hi> mony. At least if they are resolv'd to copy out the example of their Predecessours in <hi>opposing</hi> the V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity, They should be so wise withall, as to have imitated their <hi>Methods</hi> of <hi>opposing</hi> it. Their Fathers took advantage of that lucky <hi>Crisis</hi> in <hi>1649</hi>; When the Vniversity was obnoxious for its loyalty; when learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it self was a crime; and when the Iudges were as bad, as the Petitioners. This Effort was <hi>unsuccesful</hi> indeed but <hi>well-design'd,</hi> for which we may reasonably perhaps accuse them of <hi>ingratitude,</hi> but must <hi>for once</hi> acquit them of <hi>folly.</hi> But if the Citizens shall now again renew the same designs, when there is not a return of the like favourable juncture; It will be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:100139:3"/>
suspected that they are heirs only of their Fathers malice, but not of their <hi>cunning.</hi> For can they think this a fit time to depress Learning, and Religion? Can they imagine, that those Charters, which have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways given to us by the <hi>best,</hi> and <hi>greatest</hi> of our Kings will not receive confirmation from their <hi>present Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties</hi>? Or that <hi>this</hi> Honourable <hi>house</hi> of <hi>Commons</hi> is less a Friend to <hi>Learning,</hi> and <hi>Justice</hi> than <hi>the Wise Parliament</hi> which first ratify'd our Charters? If not; if there be no ground for these surmizes now; we may probably think, That the Citizens will either wholly desist; or expect a fairer opportunity of undermining their <hi>Benefactours.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what success any discourse may have, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it self to the <hi>justice,</hi> and <hi>prudence</hi> of the <hi>City,</hi> we dare not determine; More certain we are, That these Treatises will succeed in their other design, and will give full satisfaction to all <hi>impartial,</hi> and unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judic'd <hi>Readers.</hi> The Articles of the City have all met with <hi>plain,</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> answers: The Charters, that we insist on, are <hi>nam'd,</hi> and <hi>pointed out</hi>; and no subterfuge is taken in general expressions. The Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact will be abundantly justify'd by our Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; The pretended difficulty in law, is, for the use of the City, made obvious to every capacity, and we sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to others judgments, whether the inferences, which are few, are not fairly drawn, and warranted by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. For as the Cause it self was such, That it needed
<pb facs="tcp:100139:4"/>
no other advantage, than to be set in its true light; so was the dignity of the <hi>Body concern'd</hi> so great, that it disdain'd any assistance from sophistry.</p>
                  <p>The Nature of this work would not allow us the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of digressions and therefore it is <hi>still</hi> to be wish'd That all men, in a greater work, were distinctly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of the <hi>first rise</hi> of our Priviledges; of <hi>the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> upon which they were <hi>first</hi> given; and the <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute necessity</hi> of the <hi>continuance</hi> of them; That they were acquainted with the <hi>offences</hi> of the City that <hi>oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd</hi> our Charters; with the <hi>signal</hi> and <hi>Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary wisdom</hi> of those Princes, that granted them; and lastly with the <hi>constant success,</hi> which, upon all contests with the Town, <hi>attended,</hi> and <hi>confirm'd</hi> them. For since above an Hundred volumes are printed beyond Sea concerning the <hi>Rights</hi> of <hi>Universities</hi> and The <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges</hi> of <hi>Students</hi>; It is to be hop'd, That we, who yeild not to any forrain Vniversity in the greatness of our Priviledges, will show equall diligence, in the <hi>just History,</hi> and <hi>defence</hi> of them. The only thing, that in all probability hath hitherto prevented their work, hath been the integrity, knowledge, and favour of the Iudges; who, having usually been bred among us, knew the Extent of our Priviledges; and have not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd our rights to be examin'd by the unequal stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of the immunities of mean Corporations. For as our <hi>Charters</hi> have been such, as have left us no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to envy the <hi>forrain Authentick</hi>; so have the <hi>Year-Books</hi>
                     <pb facs="tcp:100139:4"/>
hitherto abundantly supply'd the place of <hi>Glosses,</hi> and <hi>Comments.</hi> However, tho' we have no reason at present to doubt of the continuance of the same justice to us; we may reasonably <hi>desire,</hi> and yet probably not <hi>need</hi> an <hi>exact History</hi> of <hi>our rights</hi>; as that, which tho' it might not be requisite, as a <hi>necessary support</hi>; would yet at least be commendable as an <hi>Ornament</hi> of this Vniversity.</p>

private, before a Register; and proceed in an Ecclesiastical way, by citation, excommunication, and the like, contrary to the course of the Common Laws, and their sentences are not grounded upon any certain Law, either Civil, Canon, Statute, or Common Law, but <hi>secundum oequum &amp; bonum,</hi> and meerly Arbitrary, at the Will of the Chancellor, or his Vice-Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, against whose sentence, how unreasonable soever, nor Writ of Error will be by them allowed, or other redress admitted, but only by appeal before themselves, in their Convocation or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, in which particular, the Citizens find themselves much grieved, being by those proceedings not only delayed, but oftentimes defeated of their just debts, without any redress at all.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Without any lawful power they take upon them to make Proclamations, thereby imposing not only pecuniary mulcts, but also imprisonment upon such persons as shall not obey their mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters contained in such Proclamations, and this not only upon Citizens, but likewise upon all others, dwelling within five miles of <hi>Oxon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. They claim and exercise a power over the Citizens, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose 40 <hi>s.</hi> upon any Citizen being found out of his house after 9 of the clock, albeit it be in the summer time; and albeit they be Constable in their search for Fellons, upon pursuit of hue and cry; or Aldermen of the City, or Justices of the Peace, in conveying of Malefactors to the Goal, or the like, and for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fault of present payment of the 40 <hi>s.</hi> to send them to prison, there to continue until satisfaction made to the Proctors.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. They claim the sole power of Licensing of Ale-houses, Brewers, and Maulsters, and usually take for the making of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences for Brewers to Brew, and for Maulsters to make Mault 17<hi>s.</hi> 8<hi>d.</hi> and take Recognizances of the Ale-house-keepers, but never return any of them to the Quarter Sessions.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. They have challenged to have power and <hi>de facto</hi> have exercised a power, to pull down the Citizens houses of Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and some of the Butchers Shambles within the City.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. They take upon them power to dis-common Citizens at their pleasure, and to inhibite all priviledged persons, to have
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100139:7"/>
any commerce or trading with them; which power they have also exercised upon divers Citizens.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. They exact from the Maior and sixty two Citizens, an Oath for the maintenance of the University Priviledges; whereas many of their pretended Priviledges are meere Usurpations and Inchroachments upon the Liberties of the City, which the Citizens by their Oaths are bound to preserve.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. They claim and exercise a power to enforce the Maior, and sixty two Burgesses of the City, to come yearly to St. <hi>Maries</hi> Church on the tenth of <hi>February</hi> (called by them <hi>Scholastims</hi> day) to make an Oblation at the high Altar, of sixty three pence for the slaughter of sixty three Scholars, <hi>tempore Ed.</hi> 3. to procure a Mass for the souls of the sixty three slaughtered per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; for the non-performance whereof, they give forth, That they will put a bond in suit, which the City in those days en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into the University.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. They claim a power to make By-laws, thereby to bind the Inhabitants of the City, which are meer strangers, and were never called to the making of them.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. They take upon them power to make new Officers, as Tole takers of Corn, and the like, and they constitute Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which Office of Right belongeth to the City by their ancient Charters, and Usage, time out of mind.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. They claim Felons Goods, and Deodands, by their new Charter, albeit the City time out of memory hath enjoyed, and hath right unto them by their ancient Charters, as they conceive; and albeit, the City be at the charge of keeping of Felons, and of the delivery of them.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. The Market, the Soyl, and the Streets belong to the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, together with Toll, Stallage, and Picage, yet the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity claimeth all these; and divers times by Proclamation alter the Market days, whereas the University have only the Clark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of the Market, and the perquisites, and profits thereof, belong to the City toward the feefarm Rent.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. They set up divers Taverns in <hi>Oxon,</hi> and will not permit the City to set up any, contrary to the true intent of the Statute of 7. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6.</p>
                     <p n="14">
                        <pb n="5" facs="tcp:100139:7"/>14. They claim power to set up trades within the City, and to authorize Forraigners to exercise any trade there, as Fully as a Freeman of the City, and that albeit such Forraigner ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver served as an Apprentice.</p>
                     <p n="15">15. In case the City punisheth any irregular Freeman for misdemeanor, or make any By-law for regulating of such mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demeanor, they presently become servant to some Master of Arts, or else to be an under Gardner to some Colledge, or Hall, and thereby exercise their Trades, in contempt of the City, and their By-laws, and refuse to pay any payments with the City, except such as shall be warrantable under the Seal of the University.</p>

                        <hi>April.</hi> 30. 1649. A Particular of the Grievances of the City of <hi>Oxon</hi> against the <hi>University</hi> of <hi>Oxon,</hi> together with the reasons thereof exhibited unto the Honourable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee for the regulating the said <hi>University,</hi> according to the directions of an Order of the said Committee of the <hi>26.</hi> of this instant April. <hi>1649.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p n="1">1. <hi>Grievance.</hi> THat Scholars and Priviledged persons draw Townsmen in suit to the Vice-chancellors Court for any matters whatsoever (except <hi>Mayhem, Felony,</hi> and <hi>Freehold</hi>) as well in cases where they are Plaintiffs, as where they are Defendants: in which particulars the Citizens conceive they have just cause of complaint for diverse reasons.</p>
                     <p>First, for that by the ancient Charter of <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. and divers other subsequent Charters confirmed by act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and allowed by Justices in Eyre and in the Courts at West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minster, they ought not to be impleaded out of their own Court, but to have their tryal in their own Court according to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes and usages of <hi>London,</hi> for that they are by their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to enjoy the same liberties and customs, and the Perquisites and Profits of their Court are parcel of their Fee-farme which would be left or at leastwise lessened in case that their suits and tryals should be in the Chancellors Court, as well where a privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged person is Plaintiffe as Defendant: (there being at this present near about a third part of the Housholders within the City priviledged by the University as is conceived.)</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="tcp:100139:8"/>Secondly, for that the proceedings in the University Court are by citation <hi>Viis &amp; modis,</hi> Libell, Excommunication, and the like, and the sentences of the Chancellor, or his Vice-chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, or Commissary, not confined or tyed to any certain Law, either Civil, Canon, or Common Law. But either according to any of these, or according to the Customes and Statutes of the University heretofore used or hereafter to be ordeined, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his and their best discretion, notwithstanding any Statute whatsoever either made or to be made, against whose sentence (be the same just or unjust) there is no remedy either by removing the cause to any of the Courts of Westminster either of Law or equity or otherwise than before themselves.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, for that diverse Citizens have commenced several suits in that Court both for just debts due unto them by bond, as also for insufferable injuries committed against them by privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged men after long and tedious suits of 3 or 4 years standing, and much expence, have been destitute of any redress there at all.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, for that (as the Citizens conceive) that Court and the order and manner of their proceedings consisteth not with the present Constitution of the Commonwealth or the Liberty of the People, this particular not only concerning the Citizens of <hi>Oxon,</hi> but all others who shall have any commerce or dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with a Scholar or a Priviledged Person.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. <hi>Griev.</hi> The University claimeth a power to imprison, and to impose a mulct of 40<hi>s.</hi> upon any Citizen being out of his house after nine a clock at night without such reasonable cause as the Proctors or Vice-chancellor shall allow of, the Proctor having the benefit of the mulct: and this hath been exercised not only upon private Citizens but upon the publique Magistrates and Officers of the City, as Bailiffes, Constables, and the like, being in the execution of their offices to preserve the peace, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue Hue and Cries, to keep watch and ward, Convey offenders to prison by vertue of the Justice of peace warrants, to prevent escapes from the Goal, whereof the Bailiffes have the charge and the like, which the Citizens conceive to be a great Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance contrary to the great Charter, and other Laws, to their
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100139:8"/>
Native and just liberties, the rather for that the five Aldermen and eight Assistants of the City, besides what the Law of the Land require, are by their Ancient Charters and by their Oathes bound to search for and apprehend Malefactors within the City as well by night as by day, Nevertheless the said Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens can desire no less, but that if the Maior or any Officer of the City find any priviledged person disorderly and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar they may have power and liberty to secure them until they may be sent to the Vice-chancellor or Proctor, and they to deal in like manner with the Citizens. But that the University should impose such a mulct and inflict imprisonment for Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payment upon a Citizen that is abroad after such a time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his lawful occasions, and to make the Proctor judge in his own cause whether it was a lawful occasion or not, he being to have the 40<hi>s.</hi> And for a civil man to goe to the Vice-chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor for leave to be out of his house after nine of the clock or not to stirr abroad before 4 of the clock in the morning is conceived by us to be a greater tyranny than is fit for any freeman to beare.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. <hi>Griev.</hi> That the University have heretofore restrained all Bakers and Brewers within the precincts of the City and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs thereof to bake or brew within the City, except they first take Licence from the University, for which they challenge 17<hi>s.</hi> 8<hi>d,</hi> and also enforceth them to take an Oath to observe such assize as the Vice-chancellor from time to time shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, the which the Citizens conceive to be a Grievance and a burthen both in respect of the mony extorted from them, there being no such summ of mony due by the Laws of this Land for such licence, as also for that they conceive it most proper and peculiar for the City to set up and order Trades within the City where they served as Apprentice, and for other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons hereafter mentioned in the Grievance concerning Trades being contrary to the Liberty of the People, and a priviledge no waies suitable or proper (as the Citizens conceive) for Scholars to pretend unto.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. <hi>Griev.</hi> The Vice-chancellor heretofore hath by power pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100139:9"/>
down some Citizens houses of habitation for which there as yet hath no satisfaction been made either to the Tenant or Tenants in possession, or to the Citizens who had the inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance thereof. As namely in particular the house of one <hi>Tredwell,</hi> then worth 10 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> and the house of one Master <hi>Chambers,</hi> worth 6 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> for which it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the University ought to make satisfaction both to the Tenants and the City.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. <hi>Gr.</hi> The Citizens conceive it to be a great pressure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with the Principles of charity, or the liberties of the people, or the Laws of the Land to inhibit all the Members or priviledged persons of the University to have any commerce, trade, or dealing with such Citizens as the Vice-chancellor or Proctors at their liberty shall dislike, it being a means to breed enmity between neighbour and neighbour; and to hinder mutual amity between friend and friend, as also tending to a Monopoly of Trading, and done for the maintaining of some private interest, of meer will and power against the publique interest of the Cities Liberties. And also to the utter ruine and destruction at their pleasure of any Citizen and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in their Trade.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Touching the Oath that the Vniversity demandeth of the Maior and of the Citizens.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. <hi>Gr.</hi> The Citizens take it as a grievance and burthen to their Consciences, (which they hope the wisdome and Piety of the Parliament will not suffer) to have an Oath imposed upon them in General Tearms to maintain the Priviledges of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity, the Citizens not knowing what they are. And the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity pretending all to be just which they claim; and besides the Maior by his Oath is bound to maintain all the rights and liberties of the City, many of which do clash and stand in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to divers of those which the University claim.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. <hi>Gr.</hi> The Citizens find themselves very much a grieved that the Maior and 62 Citizens with him should be compelled to come to St. <hi>Maries</hi> yearly upon the tenth day of <hi>February</hi> to make an oblation there at the high Altar of 63 pence for the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:100139:9"/>
souls of 63 Scholars or Priviledged persons slaine in the time of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> This in the Original being gross superstition and the memory and continuance of it to be totally abolished with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any memorial thereof to be observed: and therefore hope and desire that one Indenture and one obligation of the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of 1000 markes entered into by the City unto the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity in those daies of superstition, for the continuance of that superstitious anniversary, may be delivered up to the Citizens to be cancelled, and the obloquie put upon the Citizens by reason of this Ceremony quite abolished, And whereas the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity now saith that they will be content with the 5<hi>s.</hi> 3<hi>d. per annum</hi> and dispense with the superstitious Ceremony, the Citizens desire by the wisdom and Authority of Parliament they shall be excused from any such acknowledgment of that servile and superstitious nature. Not that we should contend with the University for such small matters (towards whom we ever have, and shall respectively Comport our selves) but that we may not part with our liberties at any rate, nor beare witness against the truth.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. <hi>Gr.</hi> The University claimeth power to make By-Laws to bind the Inhabitants of the City, and to lay both pecuniary mulcts and Imprisonment upon the breakers thereof, as upon Taylors that have made Gowns after other fashions then have been set down in their Private orders, which the Citizens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be an unjust and arbitrary practice, That they should be bound by such Laws as they never knew, nor never consen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to by themselves or any representative. And their estates and persons should be lyable to the pleasure of others to whose Acts or Actions they are no ways Privy, and is as they conceive contrary to the fundamental Laws of this Land, and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of freemen of this Nation.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. <hi>Gr.</hi> The University claimeth Felon's goods and Deodands, which the Citizens take as a Grievance, for that by their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Charters they are by apt words granted unto them. And moreover the Citizens have the Custody and charge of the Gaol and of the Prisoners, and the power to deliver the Gaol
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:100139:10"/>
and lyable to all escapes; And it seemeth unreasonable that the Citizens should be at all the charge and the University to have all the profit, and such perquisites (besides for the reasons afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said) may seem not very proper nor convenient for Scholars to trouble themselves withal.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. <hi>Gr.</hi> The University inhibiteth the City from setting up any Taverns within the City, or the selling of Wine by retaile, the which the Citizens conceive to be against the true meaning of the Stat. 7. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. And against divers of the ancient Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the City, and therefore desire that this Grievance like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise may be redressed.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. <hi>Gr.</hi> The University assumeth power to set up Trades within the City, and to authorize Forraigners to exercise Trades there, albeit they never serv'd as an Apprentice, the which the Citizens take as a great Grievance and oppression, It being granted unto them by divers and sundry ancient Charters and confirmed in Parliament, that no person or persons whatsoever, who are not of their Guild, shall set up any Trades or sell by Retaile with them, much less that such that have not served as Apprentices, nor are liable to performe duties or services of the Commonwealth, as they pretend.</p>
                     <p>The Citizens are willing that the University may enjoy and continue all just and due Priviledges, which either make for the advancement of Learning, or are fit for them to enjoy, but any priviledge or practice, which exalts it self above the power of the Civil Magistrate, which is founded upon super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition or Tyranny, or which is inconsistent with the freedom and just Immunities of a subject or free Citizen, they may hope, and earnestly pray may be by the wisdom and goodness of this Parliament quite abolished.</p>

We answer and deny that the Petitioners have the <hi>inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> of the said Meadow, but only a <hi>right of Common</hi>; and that divers Colleges of the University, and their Tenants, and other men, are (as we conceive) equally interessed with the Petitioners in <hi>a right of Common</hi> in that Meadow.</item>
                        <item>2. That the number of <hi>poor People,</hi> both now and hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abounding in the City, is very much occasioned by the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners illegal erecting of multitudes of <hi>Cottages</hi> upon the Town wall and Ditch, which they rent out to such poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and thereby much enhance their own Revenues, to the prejudice and impoverishing of the University, by whose Free and charitable contributions those poor are exceedingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved and maintained.</item>
                        <item>3. That if all the Charitable <hi>donations</hi> given to maintain the <hi>Poor of Oxford</hi> by several <hi>Members of the Vniversity</hi> were rightly imployed by the Petitioners to that end for which they were given, they could not want a convenient stock wherewithall to set them on work, as we conceive.</item>
                        <item>4. That the improvement desired by the <hi>inclosure of Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mead</hi> would not be only to the prejudice of the right of several Colleges and their Tenants in respect of their said <hi>right of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> therein, but to the general impoverishment of the <hi>poor</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the City, who claim and use a like right of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the said ground, which hath been, and is a great sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to them, and therefore when the like design of enclosure hath heretofore been attempted by the <hi>richer</hi> Citizens, it has been mainly opposed and hindred by the <hi>poor</hi> inhabitants of <hi>Oxon</hi>; and so (we conceive) they do oppose it at present. And it is to be considered that the <hi>piece of ground</hi> which they desire

to enclose containes by estimation eight hundred <hi>Acres</hi> of rich Meadow.</item>

We do use Summons or <hi>Citations</hi> at first, before we grant out an Arrest against persons of quality, and such as are likely to abide and continue within the jurisdiction: But against Strangers that have no abiding there, and against such as are like to fly we do grant Arrests without any previous Citation.</item>
                        <item>7. That our Sentences are (as the Petitioners untruly sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest) <hi>meerly arbitrary and grounded upon no Law, but at the will of the Iudge,</hi> we deny; for in his Sentences the Judge followes the Justice and Equity of the Civil Law, and Common Law, and the Statutes of the Land, against which he cannot nor does not judge.</item>
                        <item>8. If the Judge be thought to have judged erroniously or unjustly, <hi>Writs of Error</hi> are not brought to our Court, because the manner of proceedings there are not as at the Common Law, but the party grieved may either <hi>appeal,</hi> or complaine of a <hi>nullity,</hi> and have redress. And if it be appealed in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity there are there appointed yearly four or five Doctors, and some Masters from the Congregation and Convocation to hear the complaint, and from their judgments there lies an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Supream Power in Chancery, where the Judges of the Land and other learned Lawyers, both Common and Civil, have usually been nominated Judges Delegates, as in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty and Prerogative Court.</item>

                     <list>
                        <item>1. For that the University Court and the jurisdiction thereof, is of a higher antiquity then any Charter of the Citizens legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirmed concerning their Court.</item>
                        <item>2. For that in the most and principal Charters of the City, as also in such Acts of Parliament as tend to the confirmation of them, there is an express <hi>saving</hi> of all the Rights and Priviledges of the University.</item>
                        <item>3. For that it appears by common Practice that the Citizens mutually sue one another in the Courts at <hi>Westminster</hi> and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, both by original Suits commenced in those Courts, and by removing their Suits out of their own Courts by Writs of <hi>Habeas Corpus, Certiorari,</hi> and <hi>Writs of Error.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4. For that they are ordinarily sued by Strangers both in the Courts at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and other Courts; and we cannot find that ever they pleaded any such <hi>Charter of Exemption</hi>; or if they did, that any such Plea was ever allowed to them; Whereas the Universities Priviledge hath been frequently pleaded and in all ages <hi>allowed.</hi>

                     <list>
                        <head>We answer.</head>
                        <item>1. The Petitioners have not made it appear, nor so much as asserted, that <hi>London</hi> has any such Liberty or custome, whereby <hi>They</hi> may not sue and be sued out of their own Courts.</item>
                        <item>2. That supposing <hi>They</hi> have such a Liberty or Custome <hi>at present,</hi> yet the Petitioners have not made it appear, or so much as asserted that <hi>London</hi> had any such Liberty at or before the time of the Grant of those surmised Charters to the City of <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>3. That divers other Cities and Boroughs in <hi>England</hi> have by their respective Charters like Grants of the same Liberties with <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Oxon,</hi> who yet are not exempted from suing and being sued out of their own Courts.</item>

                           <pb n="18" facs="tcp:100139:14"/>4. That it will appear that the most ancient Charter which the City of <hi>Oxon</hi> can pretend to, in relation to the liberties of <hi>London,</hi> is utterly repugnant to it self as to the principal of those Liberties.</item>
                        <item>5. That <hi>Custome</hi> is the work of time, and grows without Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and therefore can not be granted by Charter.</item>
                        <item>6. That the <hi>Customs of London</hi> are of great variety, to some of which (notwithstanding their Charter be general for all) the Citizens of <hi>Oxon</hi> do not pretend; and to other some when they have laid claim by suits at common Law, by petition to the Lord Maior and Aldermen of <hi>London,</hi> by petition in Parliament, and by pleadings in Eyre, their claim has not been allowed.</item>

That ever since the Borough of <hi>Oxon</hi> was first rented out to that Corporation in <hi>Fee-Farm,</hi> they have continually faln in their Rent, but enhaunced their <hi>Revenues</hi> by Challenging and taking several particulars as belonging to their <hi>Fee-Farm</hi> which in truth are no part of it.</item>
                           <item>2. That granting the <hi>perquisites of their Court</hi> from the proper Suiters to be part of their <hi>Fee-Farm,</hi> yet their suing and being sued in the University Court, where a Scholar or privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged person is one party, would nothing impair the <hi>just per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisites</hi> of their Court or <hi>Fee-Farm,</hi> in regard it was never o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise since they had either Court or <hi>Fee-Farm</hi> in <hi>Oxon.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p n="4">4. Whereas the Petitioners conceive there are at this present near <hi>about a third part</hi> of the housholders within the City <hi>Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged</hi> by the University,
<list>
                           <head>We answer.</head>
                           <item>1. That we conceive a <hi>tenth part</hi> of the Housholders within the City and Suburbs are not priviledged persons; And that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100139:14"/>
as the <hi>benefit</hi> of their priviledge by the daily growing oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions and vexation of the Petitioners is in a manner wholy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, so the <hi>number</hi> of priviledged persons is much less than ever it was heretofore within the memory of man.</item>
                           <item>2. That if it were true which the Petitioners suggest, it thence follows, that the Petitioners by desiring (as they do in their Article) to restrain <hi>all Priviledged</hi> persons from exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing any Trade within the City, do thereby desire to expose <hi>a third part</hi> of the Housholders within the City as (being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged, as they say) to want and beggery.</item>

                     <head>To the second reason, We answer.</head>
                     <p>That it proceeds wholly upon mistakes of the <hi>manner</hi> and rules of <hi>proceeding</hi> in the University Court which we conceive we have sufficiently cleared in our former Answer to their <hi>First Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Grievances.</hi>

                  <div type="reason">
                     <head>To the third Reason, We answer.</head>
                     <p>That there is as quick <hi>expedition</hi> in our Court as in any other Courts, and they may as well object <hi>That divers persons commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced several Suits in the Courts at Westminster for just debts due unto them by bond and for injuries committed against them,</hi> and yet (it may be for want of good proof by witness, or otherwise, (as for want of able Councel, or careful Atturnies to look well to their pleadings and executions, or for want of abilitie in the parties sued) <hi>after long and tedious suits, and much expence, have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute of any redress</hi>; and therefore this manner of reasoning is not at all concludent, being an argument drawn <hi>à non causa ut causa,</hi> which if it were of any force, we might easily turn the edge of it upon the Petitioners, by giving instance in a Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged person who has a Cause now or lately depending in the Town Court, wherein he sues divers Citizens for a just debt upon Bond, and though his debt and Bond were well proved or ready to be proved by sufficient witnesses, and no defect in his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel or Atturney, nor any disability in the Defendants, yet could he not get his mony in that Court, after a long and tedious suit
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100139:15"/>
neer two years, and much expence. Yet is not the Court to be blamed, but the dilatorie cunning of the Defendants, and we cannot think it reasonable to charge the faylings of men, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intervening casualties, upon the <hi>Law</hi> or the <hi>Court,</hi> either theirs or ours; the due proceedings of which later are, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, as compendious as of any other ordinary Court whatsoever.</p>

                  <div type="reason">
                     <head>To the Fourth and last Reason, We answer.</head>
                     <list>
                        <item>1. That such Courts as ours have been found by long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to <hi>consist</hi> very well with the most flourishing <hi>Commonwealths</hi> that ever were or are in the world, and with the liberty of those people who had or have no other order or manner of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in their Courts then such as is objected to ours.</item>
                        <item>2. That (as we humbly conceive) the wisdom of this State in former ages thought it fit that our Ancestors should use the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of the <hi>Civil Laws</hi> in our Court, the better to train up young Students in the knowledge of them, that they might thereby be made more serviceable to the Commonwealth in affairs at home and abroad.</item>
                        <item>3. That our University Court is of such antiquity that the Common Law-Books, and some very ancient, take frequent no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it, the proceedings thereof being always allowed by the Common-Law. And the Lord Chief Justice <hi>Cook</hi> in his Book <hi>Of the Iurisdiction of Courts in England</hi> (lately published by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Honourable House of Commons) makes honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable mention of the Courts in both the Universities.</item>
                        <item>4. That if the Citizens be Plaintiffes (as most commonly they are) besides the expedition which they may find there, they may have the benefit of the Defendants Oath to ease them in their proof; They may have <hi>good sureties</hi> put into Court not only to bring in the Defendants, but also to <hi>pay the Iudgment and Costs</hi> of Suit; they may <hi>arrest</hi> not only the Body of any Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged person, but also his <hi>goods, debts, and things in Action.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>5. That though this particular (if it were a grievance) does not only concern the Citizens of <hi>Oxon,</hi> but <hi>all others</hi> who shall have any commerce or dealing with Scholars or Priviledged
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100139:15"/>
persons; yet have <hi>no others</hi> complained of our Court, and the Petitioners of all others have least cause.</item>
                        <item>6. That we do not challenge or exercise any other jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction over the Petitioners or others in the University Court than the Citizens of <hi>Oxon</hi> themselves, and all or most other Cities and Boroughs in <hi>England</hi> do claim and daily practice without contradiction over all other free-born people of the Land; to wit, to Arrest and compel them to answer in their respective Courts, <hi>if they can be there legally attached to Answer.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>7. That we do not claim or exercise any greater or other Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge in this particular than (as we conceive) is granted to and used by other Universities in <hi>Europe</hi> as well as ours; to wit, to sue and be sued before their own Judge: a Priviledge indulged to them and us <hi>in favor of Learning</hi>; that Scholars may not be called abroad to answer Suits, to the great neglect of their stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and expence of their time and mony.</item>
                        <item>8. That in <hi>mixt Suits</hi> where one party is of the Priviledge of the University, and the other of the City, since it cannot be otherwise but such Causes must be heard and determined either in <hi>our Court,</hi> or the <hi>Town Court,</hi> or both must be subject to a <hi>forreign jurisdiction</hi> (which would be equally repugnant to the Priviledges of both Bodies, no way advantagious unto them, and extreamly inconvenient for us) we cannot but conceive it more consonant to <hi>justice,</hi> and withal more <hi>convenient</hi> that the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Vniversity</hi> should herein take place of <hi>theirs.</hi>
                           <list>
                              <item>1. Because this Priviledge has been <hi>anciently granted</hi> to us, and we have been many hundred years in <hi>possession</hi> of it, and it is also <hi>confirmed</hi> unto us by Act of Parliament.</item>
                              <item>2. Because the Judges in the University Court, having no interest in the particular Suits brought before them, cannot be thought other then indifferent; Whereas if Scholars should be Sued in the Town Court where the Maior and Bayliffs, Judges and Jury, are all Tradesmen, it is very much to be feared it would go hard with the poor Scholars.</item>
                              <item>3. Because (as we humbly conceive) the University is still (as it has alwaies been reputed) the more noble Corporation,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100139:16"/>
more Serviceable in the publick, and in which the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has a greater interest than in the City or Citizens; who for the most part are beholding to the University for much of their livelyhood and subsistence (as themselves in the <hi>fifth Article</hi> do imply) whereas we have no dependence upon them, but only wares for our mony at dear rates.</item>
                              <item>4. Lastly, Because (as we likewise conceive) if the Petitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners should prove so unfortunately successful in their desires to obtain the liberty of Suing Scholars in their Town-Court, it would prove in the end very prejudical to themselves; for besides that it would minister occasions of discontent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual quarrels betwixt the Bodies, it would deter Scholars from having any dealing or commerce with their new Judges the Citizens.</item>

That the Right and Custome is so ancient, so strengthned by confirmation of Parliament, and the benefit thereof so great to all inhabitants by the careful practice and exercise of it, and the continuance of it so absolutely necessary for the good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the University, (especially for securing younger Scholars against the many temptations to lewdness and loosness, which they ordinarily are exposed to by means of such Towns<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as make their own advantage out of the others luxury and deboystness) that no man of any civil conversation, Stranger, Sojourner, Citizen, or other, hath ever expressed the least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy against it: As for such disorderly walkers, who are of a contrary disposition, it is used only to reduce them to civility; and the Proctors exercise the like power over them, which the Constables and Magistrates in other places are allowed by the Laws of the Land, to preserve the quiet of the place, and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the misdemeanors of such as are disorderly.</item>

We do not know that any Proctors ever exercised such power over the Publick Magistrates of the City in the due execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their offices as is charged in this Article: Or if any did the parties grieved might have their remedy against them; the University does not claim any such power.</item>
                           <item>3. We answer and deny that the City have any such ancient Charters concerning <hi>five Aldermen and eight assistants</hi> of the City as is pretended in this Article.</item>
                           <item>4. We likewise deny that in the case of <hi>Noctivagation</hi> the Proctors are any <hi>Iudges</hi> at all, but only Relators of the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors; nor are they to have the forty shillings, but only the half in case of legal conviction, as in all other cases of mulcts.</item>

Besides, we conceive that if both parties should walk in the Night, it would breed occasion of quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and tumults, if not Blood-shed. And how little cause the Petitioners have to complain of Tyranny in the exercise of this power, we dare appeal <hi>to the consciences</hi> of the best and gravest Citizens, whether <hi>they</hi> have not enjoyed both quiet and profit by the vigilant care of the Proctors in the Night-watch: <hi>To the knowledge</hi> of such others of their Body, whose disorders made them justly obnoxious to that power, whether they have not usually been much more favorably dealt with than the members of our own Body: Lastly, <hi>To the Testimony</hi> of many other civil Gentlemen both of our own and forraign Nations, who in times of peace did use to come and sojourn in <hi>Oxford</hi>; whether they did conceive it any Grievance to them to be subject to this and other rules of Government of the University, which the Petitioners are pleased to traduce as <hi>arbitrary</hi> and <hi>Tyrannical.</hi>

                     <list>
                        <item>1. That the University having the undoubted <hi>Assize of Bread and Beer</hi> (and the <hi>Oath</hi> for the observing that Assize being a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary consequent depending on it) the right and custome of admitting and <hi>Licenceing</hi> of common <hi>Brewers</hi> and <hi>Bakers</hi> in <hi>Oxon</hi> is not only ancient, but for the fitness thereof hath also received and had confirmation by Act of Parliament. Neither is it without examples of like nature in the Book-cases, where time hath indulged the like custome to persons of qualitie in other places. And this particular Right of the University hath not many years since been declared by the free and voluntary acknowledgment of the Brewers of <hi>Oxon</hi> themselves, as in due time will be shewed in writing.</item>
                        <item>2. As for the <hi>Fees</hi> of such <hi>Licences</hi> or admissions, we answer, they have been anciently paid to several <hi>Officers</hi> of the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity for their pains about that business, and are (as we conceive) in themselves but moderate, far short of such Fees as are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the City, and their members in other like cases, But the University claimeth no Fee to their Body for any such Grant or Licence.</item>
                        <item>3. We further conceive it is not <hi>improper</hi> for the University to have this right, (which in all probability) would be worse pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised and with greater prejudice to the publick, if exercised by the City; whose chief Magistrates are for the most part men of the same Trades, and who by several Acts of Parliament are prohibited from entermedling with the Assizing and Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of victuals, or the defaults therein.</item>

                        <item>1. The University never <hi>challengeth,</hi> nor did any Vice-chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor ever <hi>exercise</hi> any such power of <hi>pulling down,</hi> or abating, <hi>Townsmens houses.</hi>

                        <item>1. That the matter here intimated by the Petitioners (for it bears not any direct charge of <hi>Discommoning</hi>) is an ancient Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of the University, albeit rarely practised, and not but upon great provocation, to which the University has recourse as to their last refuge against the professed Adversaries of the publick rights, peace, and good government thereof; and that only by their joint and general consent in Convocation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we conceive our proceedings justifiable.

                        <item>2. We further answer, That this practice of the University cannot in congruity be construed as tending to a <hi>Monopoly of Trading,</hi> in the intentions of those that use it; who are neither so ignorant of their own interest, nor so much enemies to it, as to desire any thing more than an universal <hi>Freedom</hi> of <hi>Trade</hi>; which as it is most consonant to the native liberty of every Freeman, and to the Common-Law of the Land; so would it be more beneficial to Scholars than any other persons, they living wholy upon the penny, buying all commodities, but having nothing to fell. But whether the Petitioners themselves, be not in an high measure guilty of that crime which they here object to the University, we desire may be considered, for that they have got, by purchase or otherwise, into their hands seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ancient <hi>Faires,</hi> and <hi>Markets</hi> heretofore used to be kept in <hi>Oxon,</hi> and sometimes belonging to some Colledges, and have supprest them to make way for their own sole Trading in that place; and have of late without any just warrant, erected new <hi>Corporations</hi> of particular Trades, and by colour thereof engross such Trades among themselves, to the great prejudice of other Tradesmen, and the enhansing of prices upon all manner of buyers.</item>

                        <item>1. That the <hi>Oath</hi> complained of by the Petitioners, as to the <hi>form</hi> of it, hath been approved and setled upon solemne debate in Parliament above four hundred years ago.</item>
                        <item>2.

Whereas they pretend <hi>ignorance</hi> of our Priviledges, and thereby insinuate how unjust it is they should Swear to preserve them, We answer, That neither this Oath which we require, nor any other of that kind which is conceived in <hi>General terms</hi> does, by intendment of Law, bind the takers to any farther observance of the particulars comprehended within that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, then <hi>as they shall come to their knowledge</hi>; And we farther say; That this reason (if it be of any force) is much more pregnant against that Oath, which is usually imposed upon all the Freemen of <hi>Oxon</hi> at their first admittance, <hi>to maintain and keep all the Franchises, Liberties, and Customs of the City,</hi> to which many of them are altogether strangers at the time of their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that Oath, whereas none are required or admitted to Swear to maintain the Liberties of the University but a few Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of the Graver sort, to whom by reason of vicinity and long conversation amongst us, the Customs and Liberties of the University are sufficiently known.</item>
                        <item>4. Though we do confess <hi>all</hi> Priviledges to be <hi>just</hi> which we claim, yet we neither pretend to be our own Judges to determine, in point of Controversy, <hi>which are just</hi>; neither do we pretend that the Maior or any Citizen is bound to Swear, or if he do Swear, is bound to maintain all or any Priviledges barely claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the University as <hi>just,</hi> unless they be so in themselves, and have been <hi>lawfully used</hi> by the University, And therefore since (as is clear by the words of the Oath) we do not claim that the Maior and Citizens ought to Swear to maintain any other than the <hi>lawful</hi> Priviledges of the University: And that it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the Petitioners, that the Maior is bound by his Oath (and known by common practice, that every Freeman is in like manner bound) to maintain <hi>all</hi> the Liberties of the City, and that <hi>many</hi> of those do <hi>clash and stand</hi> in opposition to diverse of those which the University so claim, It must follow, that <hi>all</hi> such pretended Liberties of the City as do clash with those Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the University, which the Maior and Citizens are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by Oath to maintain, must be in themselves unlawful.</item>

That the particulars here in Question are meerly matter of Law, to which of the two Corporations <hi>Felons Goods</hi> and <hi>Deodands</hi> do of right belong; The University claims them as granted to us in express words by an Ancient Charter (the only way by which they can be granted) and this Charter is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by Act of Parliament; and we deny that the City have any such Charter precedent to ours that does grant them to the City, and upon this we are ready to submit to a Tryal at Law.</item>

                        <item>5. What charges they voluntarily put themselves to in the trials of Felons, is more than they need to do: for if the Felons be of the Body of the University, they may be tried before our Steward at our charges if we please.

                     <list>
                        <item>1. We answer, that it is one of the most ancient Liberties of the University, that the Priviledged persons thereof may use any <hi>Trade</hi> and exercise any Merchandize in <hi>Oxford,</hi> or the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs thereof as freely as any Citizen; and this hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed unto us not only by Act of Parliament, and Judgment in Parliament, but also by Indentures of Composition between the two Bodies, whereby the Priviledged persons have been as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained that should exercise such Trade and Merchandize; who in that regard are to be talliable by scot and lot and other char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges with the Free-men of the City.</item>
                        <item>
                           <pb n="32" facs="tcp:100139:21"/>2. We do not otherwise than according to this Priviledge assume power to set up trades within the City; nor do we au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize <hi>Forreigners</hi> to exercise Trades in <hi>Oxon,</hi> other than such as by the Law of the Land and Priviledge of the University are, and ought to be allowed; however some of them have of late years been unjustly molested by the Citizens for so doing.</item>
                        <item>3. We deny that the City has any <hi>Charter</hi> so confirmed as is pretended to exclude Priviledged persons from exercising law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Trades, and selling by Retail within the City, though they be not of their Guild: no such Charter having hitherto been produced upon former Hearings when this point has been in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate betwixt us.</item>
                        <item>4. Lastly we humbly conceive this Liberty cannot in equity and good conscience be taken from Priviledged persons, who are many of them Butlers, and Manciples, or other Officers and Servants to the University, and the Colledges, and Halls there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, having wives and Children to maintain, which they cannot otherwise do than by Exercising lawful Trades; their small wages and allowances which they receive by their respective pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being scarce sufficient to maintain them in meat and cloaths, and other necessaries, if they were single persons, and had no other charge.</item>

                     <head>To the Conclusion.</head>
                     <p>By what hath been said on either party we suppose it does sufficiently appear that some of the particulars in controversy betwixt us (which the University claims as their just and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Priviledges,</hi> and the City complain of as <hi>Grievances</hi>) do concern meerly matter of <hi>profit</hi> and <hi>interest;</hi> to which if our Title be good in <hi>Law,</hi> we hope they will not be thought <hi>inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient</hi> for us to enjoy; though the City desire to strip us of them. And because a full hearing and exact discussion of all their and our Charters and Pretensions would occasion much trouble to this Honourable Committee, we therefore humbly pray that we may be left to a tryal at Law for all such things as are meerly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100139:21"/>
matter of Title, and not be disturbed in our possession till we shall be evicted by Law.</p>
                     <p>As for other Particulars which concern matter of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> we likewise humbly desire, that our <hi>Right</hi> may be cleared and acknowledged <hi>first,</hi> and <hi>then</hi> the matter of <hi>Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience</hi> taken into consideration; whereby we hope it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that as those Priviledges are <hi>just</hi> and legal, so they are no way <hi>unfit,</hi> but absolutely <hi>necessary</hi> for us to enjoy, as tending to the advancement of Piety, Civility, and Learning, no way derogatory to the Power of the Civil Magistrate, not founded upon Superstition or Tyranny, nor inconsistent with the just freedome and immunities of the Citizens. Wherein we desire it may be considered, That many large immunities and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges have been granted and are enjoyed by the City in respect of the University: That their principal Benefactors have been members of the University: That they receive an ample benefit by our continual commerce and trading with them, all or most of our Revenue coming in from abroad, but expended amongst them: That their Children receive a liberal education and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment amongst us, beyond the proportion of other places: That, if it were not for the University, the City of <hi>Oxford</hi> would be but of mean consideration: That there are many other Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but only one more University in the Land, and those two as famous as any in the World: That the Universities are the publick Nurseries of Religion, Piety, Learning, and Civility, and therefore have ever been the great Care of Parliaments, and the Glory of the Nation: That though some of the Powers claimed and exercised by the University over the Citizens may <hi>seem Grievous</hi> to the Citizens, yet are they Necessary for us, without which it would be impossible to give a good accompt of that great trust which is committed to us for the training up of youth, upon whose education not only their own welfare, but the flourishing condition of the Common-wealth (next un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God) does very much depend.</p>
                     <p>We therefore humbly desire and pray, That the Golden reins of that ancient Discipline by which both the University and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100139:22"/>
City have for so many hundred of years stood and flourished together, may not be let loose, to the certain debauching of both Bodies, for the enriching and advantage of one; nor be committed to other hands; which would (we fear) engage the members of both Bodies in continual quarrels, and open a gap to such sad consequents, as we shall be sorry to see, but una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to prevent.</p>

                  <head>THE CASE OF THE UNIVERSITY of OXFORD; Shewing, that the City is not concern'd to oppose the Confirmation of their <hi>CHARTERS</hi> by <hi>PARLIAMENT.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE University desire this Confirmation of their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by Act of Parliament, only to secure themselves from a return of those Encroachments in any succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reign, which they experienc'd in the last. For when once the Grants of Kings to the University in general, and to every Colledge in particular, shall be affirmed by Law, it is evident, that there will be no pretence nor color left for any Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Power to violate our Priviledges for the future. As the University design'd nothing more by this Bill, but this Security to themselves; so were they careful to remove from the City all grounds of Jealousie on this occasion: And therefore they of their own accord charg'd this Act with a Proviso, which fully se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures the Rights, Liberties, and Immunities of the City; and puts them wholly out of the reach of this Bill. As the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is by Act of Parliament, so is the Proviso made by the same Authority; and therefore no greater power can secure our rights, than that, which, as Effectually, restrains our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments. The Town of <hi>Cambridge</hi> are so sensible of their own Security in this Clause, that though they have equal Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to oppose this Bill, as the City of <hi>Oxford;</hi> yet they wholly rest satisfied with the Proviso. But the Citizens of <hi>Oxford</hi> have taken this opportunity to present a List of their old pretended
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:100139:24"/>
Grievances, most of which were offer'd to the Parliament, as then call'd, in 1649, and rejected even by that Assembly. It is conceiv'd, that the City of <hi>Oxford</hi> will by force of the Proviso have the same liberty to dispute the Justice of our Rights after this Act, as before it; and that therefore they are in no wise concern'd to oppose the Bill, but may, without danger to them, be referr'd to the ordinary course of Law. However, since they have represented as new Grants, the ancient and unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rights of the University, founded on immemorial Customs, ancient Charters of Kings, and confirm'd all, except one, by Act of Parliament; it hath been thought sit to discover that Fallacy, and to give a full Answer to every one of their Articles.</p>
                  <p n="1">I. <hi>BY a Charter bearing date the</hi> 30. <hi>day of</hi> March 11. Car. 1. <hi>the sole Licensing of Taverns is Granted to the Vniversity, and all Magistrates and others within or without the Vniversity (except the Chancellor, and his Vice-Chancellor) are prohibited to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle with the Licensing of Vintners, in</hi> Oxford; <hi>and none are to License any Ale-houses there, but by the Express consent of the Chancellor, or Vice-Chancellor; and by colour of this Grant they do License Ale-house-keepers, and take Recognizances; but did never Return any of them to the Quarter Sessions until about ten years last past, and have since Returned the same but seldom. Whereas by the Statute made</hi> 7. Edw. 6<hi>th. the Power of granting Wine-Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censes in</hi> Oxford <hi>is Vested in the City; and also by the Ancient Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the said City, none that is not of the Guild of the said City ought to sell any Wine by Retail in the same; and the Magistrates of the said City, by several Acts of Parliament, have Power, as Their Majesties Iustices of the Peace, to License Inns and Ale-houses within the said City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answer</hi> I. The University claims the sole Licensing of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, but derives that Power much higher than from the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Car.</hi> 1. The recital and explanation of ancient Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in that Grant, will not reduce them to as low a date, as the Charter it self. And therefore since this Power was originally
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:100139:24"/>
vested in us at least under <hi>E.</hi> 3, We still justifie our claim to it as given by him; and always sav'd to us in the Statutes of his Successors. The 7. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. doth not take away this Power, but set limits to it; it restrains the University to three Taverns only, and neither by Letter, or Equity enables the City to License any. The 12. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. saves the Rights of the University, and takes away all pretences of any right from the City. For if that power, which is now lodg'd in the University, should be taken away from us; It is evident, That, according to the legal exposition of that statute, the King only, and not the City could have any advantage by our loss. For since all <hi>independant</hi> Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which had once an indisputable right of granting Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censes, are <hi>restrain'd</hi> by this Law; it is easy even for the City to inferr, That a <hi>Subordinate</hi> Corporation, which could here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore lay no good claim to that power, must <hi>at least equally</hi> be subject to that <hi>restraint.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Licensing of Ale-Houses is a Right of as ancient a date as the former; but not always perhaps in so express words sav'd to us. This Power, as a branch of the Clerk-ship of the Market, was indisputably ours: and in all Compositions with the Town, was heretofore so esteem'd and allow'd; nor is it, as we conceive, lessen'd by 5. and 6. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. For the intent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of that Act is to permit none to keep an Ale-house, but those that are Licens'd by two Justices; but not to authorize all to keep one, who can obtain that License. The Vice-Chancellor therefore doth still retain his Negative Voice; nor is it reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, since the inconvenience of Ill Houses in <hi>Oxford</hi> would be so great, that any should be permitted there without his Consent and Approbation. But Lastly, it is to be noted, That though in the precedent Statute, the Rights of the University be not expresly sav'd; yet that this Law is no otherwise enforc'd and continued by 1 <hi>Iac.</hi> c. 9. than that the ancient Priviledges of the University should not be lessen'd by it.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:100139:25"/>II. <hi>By the said Charter it is Granted, that the Chancellor, Vice-Chancellor, or Proctors, shall have Power to search by Day or by Night for suspicious Persons, and for such as can give no Account of themselves, and to punish such as are faulty by Imprisonment, Banishment, or otherwise, with a mandate to the Maior and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Town to be Assistant to the search after such Offenders; and by colour of this Charter, and a pretended Custom, they claim a Power to impose Forty shillings upon any Person (whether Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen or Stranger) being out of his House or Lodging after Nine of the Clock; which they have Exercised not only upon Private Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, but upon the Magistrates of the City in the Execution of their Offices, and have Imprisoned the Constables for keeping Watch and Ward according to the Statute of</hi> Winchester; <hi>which is a great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vasion upon the Liberty of the Subject, and hath been often so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in</hi> Westminster-Hall; <hi>wherefore it is humbly hoped this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament will not Affirm the same by a Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> II. The Power of the <hi>Night-watch</hi> is vested in both Universities by immemorial Custom, confirm'd to the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of <hi>Oxford</hi> by the Charters of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. and <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. ratified by Act of Parliament under Qu. <hi>El.</hi> and only more largely explain'd by the Charter of <hi>Car.</hi> 1. This Power being totally vested in the Vice-Chancellor, and Proctors: those Persons who have set up a Watch, upon pretence of their Office, with a design'd Affront to the University, have formerly been a merc'd by the Vice-Chan. and that Sentence against them was, upon an <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beas Corpus</hi> brought, in <hi>Painter</hi>'s Case, affirm'd in the <hi>Kings-Bench.</hi> But yet if those Turbulent Persons had not other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs, than to aid the University in their Watch; their assistance is so far from being forbidden by that Charter, that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly requir'd. The Statute of <hi>Winchester</hi> indeed enjoins a Watch to be kept; but takes not away the Universities Power of keeping it: So that the performance of this Duty by the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niversity, can be no breach of that Statute; but the neglect of it might be so.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The right of this Power being thus clear'd, much might
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100139:25"/>
be added concerning the absolute necessity of the continuance of it; especially since the exercise of it hath always been such, that nothing can be reasonably objected against the good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of that Office. We have no power to punish men for being out of their Houses after Nine, if they have any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable Cause, for being so; and we appeal to the Citizens themselves, whether we have ever been severe in admitting their Reasons or Excuses.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. <hi>By the said Charter the Clerkship of the Market is Granted to the University, with free Power to Dispose of the Stalls and Standing-Places in the Markets, to have the full Government of the Markets, and to take Toll in the Markets; Whereas the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity hath only a Title to the Clerkship of the Market, (and that did Anciently belong to the City;) but the Markets, and the place<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, and all Stallage, Piccage, and Toll, and all other Profits therein, by ancient Usage and Prescription, do yet belong unto the City; and for the Profits thereof, the City doth pay a large Fee-Farm to Their Majesties. So that in case the said Charter shall be confirmed by Parliament, the said City will lose the said Markets and Profits arising thereby, which is a very considerable part of that Revenue, whereby the Corporation is maintained and supported.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> III. The University, by the Charters of <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. and <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. had the full Government of the Market, and all other Incidents to that Office. The City indeed did pretend to take Toll; but upon complaints against it in Parliament 14 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. and 28 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. were obliged to desist. And in the year 1429, they did in Convocation openly disown both Toll, and Stal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and a publick Instrument was thereupon made. The Town do not pay any Fee-Farm-Rent to the King for these Profits; but on the contrary, the University were obliged in 29. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. to pay five pounds to the King for the Clerkship of the Market, and these Perquisites thereof.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:100139:26"/>IV. <hi>Power is given to the University, by the said Charter, to hold a Court-Leet, or view of Frank Pledge as well over the Town, and all the Inhabitants, as over the Vniversity; that it shall be a full and compleat Leet, and that the University shall have the Perquisites thereof, and Power to Distrain for the same. Whereas the City hath Five Leets, one Absolute and Compleat for North-gate Hundred, and four other for the Four Wards within the City, and therein have all the Power of Leets; Except,</hi> 1<hi>st. the Enquiry into the Assize and Assay of Bread, Beer, and Wine.</hi> 2<hi>d. The Examination of Weights and Measures.</hi> 3<hi>d. The Punishment of Fore stallers, and Regra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> 4<hi>th. The Punishment of Putrid Victuals.</hi> 5<hi>th. The Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of those who wear Arms in the Vniversity; And,</hi> 6<hi>th. the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey of the High-ways, and Streets; which being Anciently likewise in the City, were</hi> 29. Ed. <hi>the 3d. surrendered into the King's Hands, and by Him Granted to the University; and for these Six Points the Vniversity have ever since</hi> 29. Ed. 3<hi>d. held a qualified Leet over the City and Suburbs, for so much, and for so many Things and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries as were given to the Vniversity</hi> 29. Ed. 3<hi>d. And this Leet is to be served by a mixt Iury, one half Priviledged Men, and the other half Free; and the Penalties imposed by the said Vniversity in this Leet are to be Estreated, and sent to the City, and to be Levied by them to their own use towards their Fee-Farm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> IV. The University doth not only claim a qualified Leet, by the Grant of <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. but <hi>prescribes</hi> to an absolute and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete Leet; which was ratified to them by the Charter, 14. <hi>H.</hi> 8. and confirmed by Act of Parliament, 13. <hi>Eliz.</hi> The Town can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove, that the Profits of our Leets were ever granted to them; and if they could, yet the University was first intitled to them by far more ancient Charters; and consequently could not be <hi>deprived</hi> of that Right by any subsequent Grant.</p>
                  <p n="5">V. <hi>By the said Charter it is Granted, that the University shall have Power to make Orders and Laws to bind all the Inhabitants in the said City. Whereas the City and University are two distinct Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and the one in no sort Subordinate to the other; and therefore it is not reasonable that the Citizens should be bound by Laws, which they never consented to by themselves or their Representatives.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="tcp:100139:26"/>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> V. This Charter doth no otherwise subject the City to the University, than former Grants and Acts of Parliaments had subjected it. They were always before a Corporation subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to us; and in Law, as well as Interest dependant on us. They are accountable to us in our Courts, they do every year take an Oath of Fealty to us, and these, if any, are sufficient Tokens of Subjection.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Since therefore our Corporation is superior to them, it is no wonder, that our By-Laws should oblige them. And this Power was not, as they would pretend, granted to us by <hi>Car.</hi> 1. but is an ancient and unquestionable Right, already confirmed by Act of Parliament.</p>
                  <p n="6">VI. <hi>By the said Charter a Grant is made to the Vniversity of two Coroners. Whereas, time out of mind, the City hath had two Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, who have sate upon all Persons, as well Priviledged as Free, until the making the said Charter; and therefore the City having an Interest in the Coroners before the said Grant, the Grant to the Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity is void, and Inquisitions taken under their Grants</hi> Coram non Judice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> VI. The University had long before, by Charters of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. and <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. power to hear and try all Felonies and Murders, committed either by their own Members, or against them; and therefore it seemed necessary, in pursuance of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Rights, that for the better Inquiry into those Offences, that were afterwards to be finally tryed by them, the Coroner should be appointed by their Authority. This, and this only is the new Grant of <hi>Charles</hi> the First, and is such a Priviledge, as may indisputably be granted by him; and which cannot be thought to encroach on the Right of the City, who still have power to appoint a Coroner for themselves; and were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by former Charters to assign one for us. The Coroner's Power indeed was before lodged in the Chancellor and Steward; and <hi>Charles</hi> 1. did not so properly create a new Office, as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the different Powers of a former Officer.</p>
                  <p n="7">
                     <pb n="44" facs="tcp:100139:27"/>VII. <hi>By the said Chahter Towns-men are to be Answerable for their Families in Buying and Selling all Wares, where either Party is a Scholar; and also for all such Persons as they shall harbour in their Houses above three Nights; and no Towns-man is to build any Cottages without the Express leave of the Chancellor, or Vice-Chancellor, which are Restraints inconsistent with the Liberty of a Free-man of</hi> England.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> VII. These pretended new Hardships are reasonable and ancient Customs agreeable to our ancient Charters. If the Servant sells false Goods, the Master is obliged to Restitution; if a Man will harbor a Stranger above three days, he shall be responsible for him. And there is the same reason, if a Man do erect a Cottage for the Reception of such persons as if he harboured them himself. Now it is not easy to imagine, that these Customs which were the known Laws of the Land, even before the Entrance of the <hi>Normans,</hi> should be now inconsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stent with the Liberty of the People of <hi>England,</hi> and apparent Badges of Slavery.</p>
                  <p n="8">VIII. <hi>The Vniversity hath likewise by the said Charter a Grant of Felons Goods, and Power to search and seize such Goods; whereas the City doth claim the same by Charters more ancient than any the University pretended to claim by; and the University themselves, under their Common-Seal, have granted, that Felons Goods do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto the City, towards their Fee-Farm: And the City having the Charge and Custody of keeping the Gaol, and being liable to Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capes, and being at the expence of holding Sessions of the Peace, and Gaol-delivery four times in the Year, and the Execution of Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; it may seem unreasonable that the Vniversity should have the Profit of those things, which usually belong to other Cities in the same circumstances.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> VIII. Felons Goods do by no ancient Charter belong to the City of <hi>Oxford</hi>; nor can they produce any such Charter antecedent to ours. They were always, as appears by a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Records, heretofore claimed by the King, and were by the Sheriffs seised to his use. The University were not first
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100139:27"/>
intitled to them by the Charter of <hi>Charles</hi> 1. having enjoyed them long before the Date of that Grant, but by the Charter of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. confirmed by the Statute of 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> We did not therefore indeed lay any claim to them in the Composition un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. because there was no reason, that we should chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge that, which we <hi>then</hi> had no right to. But the Interest of them being then vested in the King, was, as it lawfully might, by Charters of several succeeding Princes, transferred to the University.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is not unusual in other Cases, that Felons Goods should be granted away from those that maintain the Prisoners. Nor ought the City, especially, to complain of their Expences in this kind, whose Prisoners chiefly subsist on the Alms of the University. However this is matter of Right, We insist on authentic Records, and Charters; and it is a great sign, that on their side the Records are deficient, when they have this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to Argument.</p>
                  <p n="9">IX. <hi>The Vniversity doth pretend to have a Power to discommon Citizens at their pleasure, and to inhibit all priviledg'd Persons to have any Commerce or Trading with them, which they sometimes use, to the ruin of the Citizens and their Families.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> IX. It is here own'd, that the Citizens do wholly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist by their trade with the University; and that the <hi>ruine</hi> of them and <hi>their Families,</hi> is the necessary consequence of the loss of it. This Consideration hath had so good an effect on the University, that it hath always inclin'd them to pity and moderation in the Exercise of <hi>this power</hi>; And it might be justly expected, that it should likewise have such influences on the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens; as might hinder them from opposing the just rights of that Body; on which they always heretofore were, and now confessedly are dependant. But if some of them shall still mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest the University, and disturb our peace, and good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; We cannot possibly take a juster and milder method of procuring our own quiet; than by cutting off all Correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with our factious adversaries: This right of <hi>Discommuning</hi>
                     <pb n="46" facs="tcp:100139:28"/>
then is a <hi>reasonable</hi>; and, (as by many precedents can be prov'd) an <hi>ancient</hi> Right of the University, and exercised long before that Charter upon urgent occasions; but withall so rarely pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised, that those who now complain of it, will hardly be able to remenber one single instance of it. Nor ought the Towns-Men to complain of this, who have usually made it the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Leases: that they shall not let their Houses to a Scholar as an Under-Tenant, and shall never grind at any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than their Mill.</p>
                  <p n="10">X. <hi>By the said Charter it is granted, that Scholars, their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and the Servants of the Vniversity, shall not be forced to appear at Musters, or contribute thereunto; and that they shall be discharged of Subsides, Reliefs, Impositions, and Contributions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> X. We owe not this Grant originally to <hi>Charles</hi> the First, but derive it from Custom, own'd and settled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 18. <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. and ever since allowed, upon solemn Hearings, under Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and King <hi>Iames.</hi> This is such a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Priviledge, that all Forreign Universities enjoy it. Nor is there any ground left for the City's Complaint, since it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways provided, that those Priviledged persons, who exercise Merchandize in the City, and share in the Profit, should be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually chargeable with the City for such Merchandize.</p>
                  <p n="11">XI. <hi>The Vniversity, by means of a Composition made shortly after the Conflict</hi> 29<hi rend="sup">o</hi> Edw. 3. <hi>and confirmed by the said Charter, do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Maior and</hi> 62 <hi>Citizens with him, yearly upon</hi> Scholasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus-<hi>Day</hi> (<hi>which is the</hi> 10<hi>th. day of</hi> February) <hi>to make an Oblation there upon the high Altar, of</hi> 63 <hi>Pence for the Souls of</hi> 63 <hi>Scholars slain in the time of King</hi> Edward 3. <hi>This being in the Original gross Superstition, is too great a Badg of Popery to be required in a Protestant Vniversity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> XI. The barbarous Murder of sixty three innocent Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, which they here own, and term a Conflict, and the Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the whole University drew a great and just Amercement on the Criminals. The City pretended they were not able to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100139:28"/>
pay this Fine without their utter Ruine; and did humbly pray, and at last obtained from the University a Mitigation of it.</p>
                  <p>An annual payment of an hundred Marks was then accepted; and this, by the further favor of the University, was changed into a small yearly Acknowledgment. This Ceremony, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Custom of that Age, was not wholly free from Superstition; and was therefore by consent of both parties, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Queen <hi>Elizaheth,</hi> changed into a Sermon, a Communion and Offering. The Custom did not take its rise from any gross Superstition, unless it be so to make satisfaction for <hi>Murder</hi> and <hi>Robbery</hi>; and if the continuance of it still displeases them, they may put an end to it themselves, by discharging their Bonds.</p>
                  <p n="12">XII. <hi>By the said Charter it is granted, that Scholars, or Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd Persons shall not be impleaded in the Courts of</hi> Westminster, <hi>for such things as the Chancellor hath cognizance of; and that they shall be dismissed from thence without pleading their Priviledg, or paying their Fees, which doth often fall out to be a very great Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression to the Officers and Ministers of Iustice; for if upon demand of the Vice-Chancellor they do not discharge such Priviledg'd Persons, the Vice-Chancellor, by colour of this Clause, doth imprison the Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff; as on the</hi> 20<hi>th. of</hi> October <hi>last he did on</hi> Edward Adams, <hi>a sworn Bayliff, for not discharging</hi> Henry Wildgoose, <hi>who was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rested at the Suit of the City, by a Writ issuing out of the Court of Common-Pleas; and by colour of the said Clause, if any Person sue a Priviledg'd Man in any of the Courts of</hi> Westminster, <hi>the said Vice-Chancellor doth cite the Plaintiff into the Court of the Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity for breach of their Statutes, and doth condemn him in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences for suing a Privilegd'd Person out of the Vniversity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> XII. It seems absolutely necessary, as well for the <hi>quiet,</hi> and <hi>security</hi> of the Scholars, as for the better maintaining of <hi>discipline</hi> among them, that their own Governors only should have an <hi>immediate jurisdiction</hi> over them. And therefore there is not any University <hi>abroad,</hi> where the members of it have not a right to be impleaded in their own <hi>Forum</hi> only and to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from any forraign power. This University of <hi>Oxford,</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:100139:29"/>
more particularly hath so long enjoy'd this <hi>Priviledge,</hi> that it is not possible to assign the date of the <hi>Original grant.</hi> For since we find the autority of our Court frequently own'd and allow'd under <hi>Hen.</hi> 3<hi>d. Ed.</hi> 2<hi>d.</hi> and <hi>Ed.</hi> 3<hi>d.</hi> We have reason to think that this power is as ancient, as the University it self. Our right to it then is so well founded on <hi>reason</hi> and immemorial Custom, that it is no wonder, if we find it anciently in the year books not only acknowledged by the Town, but always willingly own'd by the <hi>Iudges,</hi> even before it was, as it is now, confirm'd by Act of Parliament. The Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> especially who is not usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a Friend to any other Courts, but those at <hi>Westminster,</hi> doth yet, according to the example of his Predecessors, make an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable mention of this Court; and gives that Statute the name of <hi>Actus Benedictus,</hi> that confirm'd it. The Procedures of it have always been within the bounds of their ancient Jurisdiction; and of this we need have no clearer evidence, than that the only Act of injustice here alleg'd, is that we discharge our own members; and arrest those, who deny our Autority and violate our right. The Citizens were certainly ill inform'd, when for a signal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of our Exorbitances, they charge us only with the due exercise of that power; which, upon solemn hearings hath <hi>twice at least,</hi> been acknowledg'd at <hi>Westminster.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">XIII. <hi>By the said Charter it is Granted, that Priviledged Men shall have as much Liberty to Trade as the Freemen of the said City, and by color of this Grant, the said Vniversity do take upon them to set up Trades, and to License certain Persons whom they call Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd Persons, openly to use Trades, and to sell Merchandizes within the said City, and Suburbs by Retail, which is contrary to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Charters, Customs, and Priviledges of the said City, and to certain Compositions and Agreements made between the said Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity and City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> XIII. Priviledg'd Persons have so ancient a right to the Exercise of any Trade; that, their prescription to it commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces before the oldest Charter to the City, and is sav'd by it. This right is allow'd in Parliament 18 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. declar'd by express
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100139:29"/>
words 14 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. ratify'd by Statute under Qu. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and only more largely explain'd by <hi>Car.</hi> 1. Limits have since been put to this Priviledge; which the University have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver transgress'd; nor have ever, as the Town uses to do, Pleaded their Ancient Rights in bar of the subsequent restri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of it.</p>
                  <p n="14">XIV. <hi>Whereas by certain Compositions heretofore made between the said Vniversity and City, the Menial Servants of all Scholars, and all their other Servants taking Wages without Fraud or Deceit, are to enjoy the Priviledge of the Vniversity; the said Vniversity, upon pretence of latter Grants, have fraudulently, and with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to weaken the Government of the said City, granted colourable Priviledges to divers Members of the City; and upon pretence that they were become the under Groom, Gardiner, or Officer of some Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, have matriculated them, and whilst they have continued Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the City, have administred unto them an Oath to the effect following,</hi> viz. You shall swear, that you shall not attempt any Cause of yours before the Maior or Bayliffs of <hi>Oxford,</hi> neither shall you answer before any of them as your Judg, so long as you shall continue a Priviledg'd Person. So God, <hi>&amp;c. which in terms is repugnant to the Oath which every Freeman of the City doth take at the time of his admission into the Liberties of the said City; and particularly they have within the space of three Months last past, matriculated one</hi> William Turton, <hi>upon pretence that the said</hi> William Turton <hi>was Gardiner of</hi> Exeter <hi>Colledge: Whereas the said</hi> William Turton <hi>was, and yet is a Freeman of the said City, and doth continue to use the Trade of a Vintner, and obtained the Title of the said Office, only to avoid the bearing such Offices in the said City, as his Condition and Substance had made him capable of. Also one</hi> Henry Wildgoose <hi>a Freeman, and one of the Common-Council of the said City, being apprehensive that he should be chosen into the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Chamberlain of the said City, to avoid the same about two days before the Election for the said Office, did procure himself to be matriculated, upon pretence that he was a Groom to one Dr.</hi> Irish, <hi>although the said</hi> Henry Wildgoose <hi>did, and yet doth continue the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100139:30"/>
Trade of a Painter, within the said City, and hath no further relation to the said Dr.</hi> Irish, <hi>than to protect himself against the said City; and by colour of the said Matriculation, the said</hi> Henry Wildgoose <hi>being elected Chamberlain of the said City, did, and yet doth refuse to accept the said Office, and is protected in his Disobedience by the Vniversity, by which means other Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens are encouraged to withdraw themselves from their Majesties Service in the said City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> XIV. We have hitherto made good our Claim to these Rights and Priviledges; it remains that we clear our selves from the Charge of abusing them: We have given no colourable Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges to any Member of the City; but neither have nor could deny their just Rights to those that demand them. <hi>Wildgoose,</hi> as a Limner, was entitled to his Priviledge; the Right to it was vested in him by his Trade; Matriculation is only declaratory of that Right. Whoever will plead his Priviledge, must register his Name; and Men may lawfully forbear entry, till they have need of the Plea. His being Servant to Dr. <hi>Irish</hi> is a new Right to his Priviledge; but his former Title was not destroyed by the new one that is superinduced. The City surmise that he entred into this service, to decline an Office there; but he hath sworn, that they, in his Opinion, put the Office upon him, because he entered into this Service: So that here we have <hi>his</hi> Oath against <hi>their</hi> Suspicion; and which ever of the Assertions be true, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is, that the University cannot justly be blam'd for allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that Priviledge, which, according to their own Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and their Agreements with the Town, they could not lawfully deny him. <hi>Wildgoose</hi> being excluded by these Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators, was not willing to return into the Company of those that excluded him; and therefore did now embrace the opportunity of demanding that Priviledge, which was long since due to him. However, that we may judge of the truth of these assertions, it is equally false that he is Groom to Dr. <hi>Irish</hi>; as that <hi>Turton</hi> is matriculated Gardiner to <hi>Exeter Colledge. Turton</hi> is a Vintner Priviledg'd by the University; and is entred as such; that he
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100139:30"/>
exercises a Trade still is the consequent of his <hi>Licence,</hi> that he bears no Office, is the result of his Priviledge; and these are such rights, as the University can justly give, and he, as a Priviledg'd Man, ought to enjoy. The Oath of Freemen is founded on their obligation to the City; and the force of it ceases, when their dependance determines: The University is above those mean designs, which this Pamphlet charges on them; They force no Man to be Priviledg'd, nor accept the price of their Priviledge; and, if the Citizens are so pleas'd, it would be an easie composition, that no Free-man should ever enjoy it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> We have no reason to think, That <hi>Wildgoose</hi> was guilty of a <hi>Fraud;</hi> because <hi>we</hi> have as yet receiv'd no proof against him. <hi>However</hi> if his guilt was admitted, it is very hard to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, how his crime can possibly affect <hi>us,</hi> and be made any part of the Charge against the <hi>Vniversity.</hi> If <hi>he</hi> had any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justifiable design in procuring his Matriculation; is it probable, that he would acquaint the <hi>Vice-Chan.</hi> with it; or that the <hi>Vice-Chan.</hi> should know it without such notice? A private discourse is said to have pass'd between Mr. <hi>Recorder</hi> and <hi>Wildgoose,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning a small Office in the Town; and shall the University be thought <hi>parties</hi> to the <hi>Fraud</hi> for not <hi>hearing</hi> it? If a man, upon the like designs, is entred a Clerk in the Common-Pleas; shall the <hi>future</hi> discovery of his <hi>Fraudulent intentions</hi> cast any reflexion on the honesty of the <hi>Prothonotary,</hi> or the integrity of the <hi>Iudges</hi>? The Matriculation then of this Person cannot possibly be any crime in the University; and therefore the whole offence must be resolv'd into <hi>our protection of him in his disobedience.</hi> While his name remains in our Register, he is one of our members; and, as such, hath right to our <hi>protection</hi>; But if the <hi>Fraud</hi> shall be prov'd <hi>to us</hi> we are ready to alter the roll; and <hi>by consequence</hi> to deprive him of his Priviledge. We do not therefore justify any <hi>Fraud,</hi> because we know of none; and it is the duty, and interest of the City to take care, that we should be acquainted with it. This <hi>Priviledge</hi> was so far
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100139:31"/>
from being granted, <hi>pendente lite;</hi> that even, before any <hi>cause</hi> of <hi>action,</hi> it was obtain'd; and therefore any <hi>Fraudulent design</hi> cannot in this Case be pretended to appear by a <hi>notoriety</hi> of the <hi>Fact;</hi> but is to be made out by those means only, which are not yet <hi>offer'd</hi> to us, the <hi>Evidence</hi> of the <hi>Parties concern'd.</hi> Till therefore <hi>Wildgoose</hi>'s offence be prov'd to the <hi>Vice-Chancellor,</hi> He cannot in justice alter the Register; and, as long as his name shall continue <hi>there,</hi> we cannot but think, with submission to <hi>this house,</hi> that he hath a just title to <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of a <hi>Matriculated Person.</hi> For if one of <hi>your</hi> Honourable house shall by <hi>Bribery</hi> obtain an <hi>Election,</hi> and, after that, a <hi>return</hi>; and, before any Examination of his Case in the house, be <hi>sued</hi> in Westminster-Hall; the Judges undoubtedly <hi>shall not</hi> have <hi>cognizance</hi> of his <hi>Crime,</hi> nor can suffer his <hi>Bribery</hi> to be insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted on, as a barr to his <hi>Priviledge.</hi> Till the <hi>return</hi> be <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended</hi> he is <hi>actually</hi> a <hi>member</hi> of your house; and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently hath yet a right to those Priviledges which you <hi>deservedly</hi> enjoy. When the <hi>Bribery</hi> shall appear to your Committee, <hi>They</hi> certainly <hi>will,</hi> and they <hi>only can</hi> deprive him of any <hi>place</hi> in Parliament, and so <hi>necessarily</hi> devest him of the <hi>Priviledge,</hi> that <hi>attends</hi> it. This house is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly sensible, that this Case is exactly parallel to ours; we are so far from being Patrons of Fraud, that we desire an opportunity of punishing it; we require nothing of the City, but to add <hi>proof</hi> to their <hi>surmizes</hi>; and then to receive <hi>justice,</hi> as they <hi>ought,</hi> from <hi>our hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have been longer in the answer to this Objection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Citizens have every where laid the greatest weight on it; and because it seems requisite fully to convince this house; that we are not more <hi>careful</hi> in <hi>maintaining</hi> our <hi>just rights</hi> than we are <hi>cautious</hi> in <hi>not abusing</hi> our <hi>power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus have we sufficiently prov'd, that those controverted Rights were not originally grounded on a late Charter, but on ancient Customs, and Grants, most of them being expresly, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100139:31"/>
all heretofore implicitly confirm'd by Parliament. And now it is time to enquire what credit is to be given to those who have charged Novelty on those Grants, which are as ancient as our Constitution, and are the Inheritances of our Fore-Fathers. They are such Priviledges, as our University never did, because they could not want; the absolute necessity of them was the occasion of their ancient Usage: and since <hi>That</hi> hath given us a Title to them, we may reasonably hope, that this Honourable House will now preserve them to us, as well in favor to Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as in respect to Justice.</p>
                  <p>Thus have we fully recited and answer'd all the Articles of the City; and now we think it less nauseous to answer, than to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat their Rhetorick; which hath no other Character of Truth, than that of Plainess and Simplicity: We cannot own, that Card. <hi>Woolsey</hi> and Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> procur'd Charters absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly new for us; but in this we are oblig'd to them, that they took care to have our Ancient Charters explain'd: For, since we are to deal with unquiet Men, an Explanation of a former Grant, is an equal favor to a new one. If the University had Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and declin'd the use of them, it is such an instance of their Moderation, as we wish and may wish to see copied by the City. We have no design on the City; The Present Act can give us no advantage over them, and if we had purpos'd, that it should have done so; we would hardly have added the Proviso. For whatever may seem to those Gentlemen, the Force of the Clause is so evident, to all Men of Sense and Law; that, in reference to the City, it wholly disables and destroys the Bill.</p>
                  <p>We are not concern'd to accuse the Citizens, but since some of them have been ready in surrendring their Charters, and have since been forward Regulators; we hope that they will take some more agreeable Standard to measure their Deserts by, than the Merits of the University. And now lastly, if these Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges have been anciently ours, transmitted to us from our
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100139:32"/>
Predecessors, affirm'd by former Kings, ratified by Statutes, and generously defended by us in the most dangerous times: We have reason to hope, that our undoubted Rights will by this Honorable House be preserv'd to us, both against the Encroachment of an Arbitrary Power, and of an Unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble City.</p>
