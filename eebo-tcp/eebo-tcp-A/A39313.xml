            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

too: but the world by wiſdome knows not God, and this wiſdome is no better then fooliſhneſſe with God: You ſee briefly, what the name Heretick Imports; the choice of an opinion not generally received; Though ſometimes it falls out to be the truth, even the truth it ſelfe, the Way, the Truth, and the Life, even Chriſt himſelf.</p>
            <p>The next word, which is Sect, whence comes the common name Sectaries, a word now ſo much in uſe; and this is no other, then the Latine of the former Greek word, made into Engliſh, as you may ſee, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 17.

Chap. 27. 51. <hi>Luke</hi> 5. 26. and many other places, ſo that Schiſme is properly a ſeperation or diviſion in a body, whoſe parts were before united, and in Scripture ſignification holds forth a diviſion, or diſcention in Judgement, or opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from others in what was before received and maintained together with them; there muſt be a Vnion or Conjunction before this parting and diviſion, according to the true and proper ſenſe of the word, or elſe it cannot be a Schiſme; the full underſtanding of the word you may have in <hi>Iohn</hi> 7 43. and 10. 19. compared with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 18 19. the two firſt texts tels us there was a diviſion among the people: and in the laſt the tearms Hereſie, Sect, and Schiſme, are uſed promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuouſly, and ſeem to ſignifie but the ſame thing, as in ver. 18. I heare there are Schiſmes among you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I partly beleeve it; and in the 19. the Apoſtle renders the reaſon of this beliefe; for there muſt be Hereſies, or Sects; or it muſt be ſo, for this cauſe, that thoſe that are approved may be made manifeſt:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62477:9"/>
So here you have all together, and hold out but the very ſame to us, or at moſt, that one is the cauſe, and the other the effect; becauſe the choice of an opinion differing from others, is oft, and hath been an occaſion to thoſe that entertain that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, to divde from others in their practiſe: alſo thus, Hereſie hath uſually in the ordinarie ſenſe of men, referred to the Judgment, and Schiſme to the practiſe.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the Churches of the New Teſtament were every way true and ſound, both in reſpect of their Foundation, Members, Miniſtry, Doctrines, Inſtitutions, and Cenſures, in their primitive Apoſtolicall planting, therefore thoſe that were once joyned to them, and then choſe out any opinion to themſelves, differing from them, and upon that opinion made a diviſion and ſeperation in their practiſe, were in the true genuine ſignification of the words, truly and properly Hereticks and Schiſmaticks ſo called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but becauſe the Churches of Ieſus Chriſt ſtraight after, &amp; even in the Apoſtles time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to decline from their firſt purity, &amp; every way, &amp; to wax worſe and worſe, till the man of ſin, mentioned, <hi>2 Theſſ. 2. 3. 6.</hi> came fully to be revealed, which hath now been for many hundred of yeares, therefore ſuch could not be Hereticks and Schiſmaticks: who after the Apoſtles time, and in ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ages took up opinions, which were contrary both to the Doctrine and Practiſe of thoſe declining Churches; which were now no longer the true Churches of Ieſus Chriſt, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their originall Inſtitution and Plantation, but the falfe and faigned Churches of Antichriſt, which were to ſucceed and come in the room and ſtead of the true ones, as is cleare by the whole book of the Revelations, which is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a propheticall Hiſtory, and Narrative of the Riſe, Reign, and Ruine of Antichriſt; where you may ſee how large his Territories are, &amp; how far his power reacheth, eſpecially in that I ext of <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. where it it ſaid ver. 3. that all the world wondered after the Beaſt; and ver. 8.

            <p>And ſo I come to the ſecond Point, wherein I ſhall be brief, which is:</p>

            <p>I have told you formerly in this diſcourſe, whileſt I opened the ſeverall words, that according to the true nature of the word, <hi>Schiſme ſignifies a diſ-union, diviſion, or cleaving aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of parts, which were before united in a ſolid body:</hi> Let us apply this to the buſineſſe in hand, and <hi>Schiſme</hi> is nothing elſe but a diviſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ſeparation in judgement and practiſe of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from ſome Church or body, to which they were before united: and when I pray was it that thoſe who are now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Hereticks, Sectaries,</hi> and <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> were joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a body with thoſe who are termed <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and who put theſe names upon them?

of any <hi>Presbyterian Government</hi> or <hi>Churches</hi> to be erected in this Kingdom.</p>

            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I anſwer, if the Members be ſuch (as indeed it is too true) this cannot but be a Juſt cauſe of breaking from them, though men for ſuch a ſeparation, ought not to be termed Schiſmaticks (for Schiſme is alwayes a cauſleſſe ſeperation) whilſt they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part rather from their corruptions, then their Communion; being ready to joyn with them in ſuch acts of Piety, wherein they are not obliged to profeſſe or practiſe, what they are perſwaded is Eroneous; but I conclude this argument with this Aſſertion:</p>
            <p>That to leave the Church, and to leave the externall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of a Presbyterian Church, is not one and the ſame, but two diſtinct things: the firſt is done by ceaſing to be a Member of the Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> by ceaſing to have thoſe requiſites which make &amp; conſtitute a man a Member of it, (<hi>viz.</hi>) Faith and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: the ſecond by refuſing to communicate with ſuch a Church in her publike worſhip and ſervice of God: I affirme this as a certain and undoubted truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>there is no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of communicating with true Believers in evill actions;</hi> when men are Convinced, know, and believe they are ſo; nay, I aſſert farther, <hi>there is a neceſſity herein of ſeperation from them:</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:62477:14"/>
and men may without ſcruple, forſake and renounce the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and practiſe of ſome opinions and obſervances, the which your Churches hold, and in which they do communicate, but I maintain, that this is done without <hi>Hereſie or Schiſme;</hi> becauſe they have cauſe to do ſo, and no man can have cauſe to be a Heretick or Schiſmatick; and ſo I paſſe to the third Poſition, which is:</p>
            <p>That in caſe the name of Sectaries &amp; Schiſmaticks be truly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable<note place="margin">3. Point.</note> to any perſons in this Nation, that themſelves and no others can ſo properly deſerve that name; and that they only make the rent and diviſion that is amongſt us; my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, becauſe theſe men endeavour to force and compell o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the opinion and practiſe of ſuch tenants, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves maintain for true, when others are convinced they are falſe; a thing themſelves did laetly much complaine againſt, and which was hatefull and deteſtable in the old Epiſcopacy, but is of a ſudden grown very laudable, and lovely in our <hi>new Presbyterie;</hi> I ſhall hold forth this truth in theſe two Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which I ſhall place as Bul-warks, to defend theſe poor harmleſſe Sectaries, from all the force the <hi>Presbyterian ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> can raiſe againſt them.</p>
            <p>1. That not every ſeparation, but onely a cauſleſſe or need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſeparation from the externall Communion of any Church is the ſin of Schiſme.</p>
            <p>If this Poſition be not ſound, there can be no juſtification of the Proteſtants ſeparation from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> nor of thoſe eminent Saints, who have in all Ages born witneſſe againſt the errours of that Church.</p>
            <p>2. That Antichriſtian <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>principle</hi> of <hi>perſecution,</hi> which makes ſome men <hi>to impoſe</hi> on others, under penalties, a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of profeſſing known errours, and practiſing known cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, is a ſufficient, juſt, &amp; neceſſary cauſe of ſeparation, and that this is the cauſe which Proteſtants alledge, to juſtifie their ſeparation from the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> now that divers things practiſed <hi>by the Presbyterian Churches are errors,</hi> known ſo to be to thoſe that depart from them: None without the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt breach of charity can deny, nor with leſſe impudency af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm they endeavour not that others ſhould believe the ſame, or ſuffer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:62477:15"/>All that men forſake in them is onely the beliefe, practiſe, and profeſſion of their errors: And for men not to forſake the <hi>belief of their errours,</hi> having diſcovered them ſo to be, <hi>is impoſſible,</hi> and not to forſake the <hi>practiſe and profeſſion</hi> of them, is <hi>damnable hypocriſie.</hi> Let them free their Churches from requiring the belief, practiſe, or profeſſion of any errour, or whether they will or no, they muſt free ſuch as depart from them, from being Schiſmaticks: for Schiſm there cannot be in leaving their communion: unleſſe men were obliged to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in it: And <hi>man</hi> cannot be obliged by <hi>man,</hi> but to what ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther formally or virtually <hi>he is obliged by God:</hi> For all juſt power is from God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God the eternall Truth, neither can nor will oblige us to believe <hi>the leaſt, and the moſt innocent falſhood, to be a truth,</hi> that is, <hi>to erre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>If men would be themſelves, and would be content that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſhould be ſo in the choice of their Religion, <hi>the ſervants of God, and not of men;</hi> if they would allow that the way to Heaven is no narrower now, then Chriſt left it; if all men that believe the Scriptures, would free themſelves from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and paſſion, and ſincerely endeavour to finde out the true ſence of them, live according to them, and require no more of others, but to do ſo: who doth not ſee (ſith <hi>all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary truths</hi> are plainly and evidently ſet down in Scripture) there would of neceſſity be amongſt all men, in all things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, <hi>unity of opinion, unity of love, and a ſpirit of mutuall toleration:</hi> By which means all <hi>Schiſme</hi> and <hi>Hereſie</hi> would be baniſhed the world, and thoſe wretched contentions, which now rend and tear in pieces, not the coat, but the Members

and Bowels of Chriſt (which mutual Pride &amp; Tyranny, curſing, killing, and damning, would fain make mortall) ſhould ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily receive a moſt bleſſed concluſion: By this means indeed, ſhould the Lord be one, and his name one in the <hi>Nations, which oneneſſe</hi> is not meant of any outward form, but of the <hi>oneneſſe of love,</hi> and affection in the ſpirit: Doubtleſſe, at this day, the moſt vehement Accuſers, are the greateſt <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,</hi> and thoſe who talk of Uniformity, do drive at Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, and will have peace with none, but their ſlaves and vaſſals.</p>
            <p>By a late learned Antagoniſt of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (and that whileſt the Prelates were in their pride) it was truly ſaid, Nothing is more againſt Religion, then to force Religion, <hi>Humane violence</hi> may make men <hi>counterfeit,</hi> but cannot make <hi>them believe,</hi> and is good for nothing, but to breed <hi>form</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and <hi>Atheiſm</hi> within. Beſides if this means of bringing men to embrace any Religion, were generally uſed, as if it may be juſtly uſed in any place <hi>by thoſe that have power,</hi> and think <hi>they have Truth:</hi> Certainly, it cannot with reaſon be denied, but that it may be uſed in every place, by thoſe that have <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer as well as they,</hi> and think they <hi>have truth as well as they,</hi> what could follow but the maintenance <hi>perhaps of truth,</hi> but perhaps only <hi>of the profeſſion of it</hi> in one place, and the <hi>oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> of it in a thouſand; what will follow, but the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion perhaps of <hi>unity,</hi> but perhaps <hi>only of uniformity</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular States, but the Imortalizing of the great and lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diviſion of Chriſtendom and the world. Therefore what can follow from it, but perhaps in the judgement of carnall policy, the Temporall benefit and tranquility of temporall States and Kingdoms, but certainly the infinite prejudice, if not the deſolation of the Kingdom of Chriſt, and therefore it well becomes them who have their portions in this life, and ſerve no higher State then that of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> or <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (nor this neither no farther then they may ſerve themſelves by its) to maintaine <hi>by Worldly power and violence their State inframent Religion:</hi> But they that the indeed lovers of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> of <hi>Truth,</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> of <hi>mankinds,</hi> ought with all <hi>courage</hi> to oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
