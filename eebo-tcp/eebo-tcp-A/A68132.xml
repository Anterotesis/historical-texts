            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of ſome imperfection in mee that
now of late haue raiſed this new building

both to thinke him leſſe worthy of

exemplary cenſures. Which wrong done

hath bound mee to make an ingenuous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement
of mine owne forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in the firſt edition of this preſent
worke, rather then to ſit ſtill and ſee his
reputation expoſed to the miſconſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to which my negligence is (&amp; in ſome
iudgements, iuſtly) imagined to haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
the firſt and originall cauſe. But let
this proteſtation be (if it may be) ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
to remooue the weight of ſiniſte im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations
from his grauity, and lay them
vpon mine owne youthfulneſſe, that I dare
engage my life, there is no man in the
whole world, who hath either conuerſed
with himſelfe in perſon, or his workes in
print, that euer will ſurmiſe this preſent
copy to haue had any teſtimony of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement,
or approbation to bee any
way befitting his place, or (which is more)
his profeſſion. Wherefore to giue a full
anſwere vnto that groſſe miſpriſion of
theirs, who imagine the worke it ſelfe to
haue beene of his writing and publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the forme wherein it now paſſeth;
whereby they take occaſion to taxe him of
<pb facs="tcp:3850:6"/>
diuers (in their iudgement) immodeſt,
light, ſcurrilous, and ridiculous paſſages
therein. I doe here abſolutely auerre, and
giue notice to all that ſhall hereafter take
view hereof, This worke was neuer his, he
neuer ſaw it, neuer dreamed of any ſuch
matter, vntill hee met it in the hand of
another man. There was indeed a little
booke ſome 8. or 9. yeares agoe that came
from <hi>Franckford,</hi> which ſome few (I know
not vpon what illumination more then
ordinary) affirmed to haue paſſed the file
of his muſe, which if it be true, it can be no
way in the world either preiudiciall to his
learning, (ſeeing it hath all perfection fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
an abſolute poeme) nor to his grauity
or profeſſion, ſeeing it was a birth of his
youth; wherein neuertheleſſe I will a vow
that hee hath towred aboue the capacities
(at leaſt aboue the imitation) of all thoſe
ouer-weening iudgements that dare any
way preſume to traduce his originall. In
iuſt defence of which worthy worke, I caſt
defiance in the teeth of all that malice or
traduce him, that it is neither any way
ſcurrilous, immodeſt, light, nor ridiculous:
and I will giue the proudeſt <hi>Critique</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3850:7"/>
that liues, as many yeares as hee and his
fellowes haue bin fooles, either to parallell
it, or to pick any the leaſt touch out of it,
which cannot bee defended euen till his
wittes that ſhall oppoſe, be drawne as dry
as euer <hi>Dutchman</hi> left cup.</p>
            <p>But as touching this preſent pile of
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> it is mine, it hath no further al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
to his, then chalke hath to cheeſe, for
as theſe haue no cohaerence in their neareſt
proprieties (which tranſlations ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
want) but onely in their generall kind
of eſſence as they are both corporeall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances;
no more doth this worke any way
reſemble his in faſhion, ſtile, or diſcourſe,
but onely in the inuention and proiect. As
for the paſſages in it, which ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to bee ſcurrilous or immodeſt, there
may perhaps bee ſome indeed that carry
not that pondrous reſpect in them which
an ancient iudgement, or retired grauity
may ſeeme to require: I grant it, what
would yee haue more? they are flaſhes of
youth: <hi>ſemel inſaniuimus omnes;</hi> And
I pray yee (that cenſure mee ſo ruthleſly)
which of you all is there, but one time or
other in the forenoone of your daies, hath
<pb facs="tcp:3850:7"/>
had his <hi>vagaries</hi> in the world, and hath
flowne out ſometimes as well as I? Oh but,
not inprint, ſaies ſome ſeuerer <hi>Critique!</hi>
Alas yet had <hi>Ouid</hi> his <hi>Amores, Seneca</hi>
his <hi>Luſus in Claudium,</hi> and others as
graue as hee, their exorbitances now and
then as vnguirt as others! But that theſe
weakeneſſes (for ſo I confeſſe they are) in
mee, ſhould be made as ſtaines to the repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of another, of one whoſe learning,
life, and workes now extant may ſerue as
purging fires whereat all thoſe that hence
haue taken occaſion to wrong him thus,
might long agoe haue lighted their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
were it neuer ſo immenſe; that my
lightneſſes ſhould bee reputed as births of
his worthines! Oh that my pen (whereby
ſince I have ignorantly iniur'd him, I doe
thus willingly and freely cleare him) could
but make them ſee what an vniuſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
they haue made of an ignorant
(and I protest vtterly vnwilling) offence!
But ſince mine owne vnwarineſſe gaue
first occaſion of thoſe vnkinde, and more
then fooliſh callumniations which igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
draweth from mine error, to ſtaine
his goodneſſe with; all the ſatisfaction I
<pb facs="tcp:3850:8"/>
can giue him, is to ſhew my ſelfe willing to
make a faire way againe for his deſerts,
in the boſomes of ſuch as hence take their
occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of diſlike, by proclaiming this truth
to all that ſhall read it, that this preſent
<hi>Diſcouery of the South-Indies</hi> is none
of his, but had this forme giuen it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
his knowledge, by one who will euer
acknowledge his worth &amp; grauity to haue
beene vtterly ignorant of any vnfit phraſe
whatſoeuer included in the whole booke.
Hee whom my contrition, and this ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
<hi>(COLLATERALLY)</hi> cannot content,
is without mercy, and I aſſure my ſelfe will
dye without merit, if hee bee not quickly
ſhipt away for this new <hi>Continent,</hi> with

            </p>
            <p>As for you (gentlemen and frinds)

Or were it that mine vnquenched thirst
and deſire of knowledge, togither with the
applauſiue carriage I found in theſe men,
were the motiues to theſe effects, I
knowe not. I was already fully acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with all the rarities of mine owne
Nation: and falling into a diſcourſe
of the profit of trauell with two Aliens of
my neare acquaintance <hi>(Peter Beroaldus,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3850:13"/>
a Frenchman, and <hi>Adrian Cornelius
Droge,</hi> a Dutchman) wherein wee had
many delightfull paſſages about compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of languages, conditions, and cities;
at last, In troth (quoth <hi>Beroaldus)</hi> I know
not as yet what trauell meanes, if hee that
leaues his natiue ſoyle to paſſe but into a
neighbour countrie, or ouer a neighbour
riuer (admit it bee the Rhine, or the Tweed)
deſerue this name (as vulgar opinion ſeemes
to allow) whereas hee neuer changes eyther
skie, ayre, or ſoyle: I ſee not (if this bee
true) any profit or worth in the world,
contained in trauell. My parents &amp; friends
at <hi>Montauban,</hi> haue written very often
for my returne, as though I were farre
from them: whereas I (beleeue mee) haue
imagined my ſelfe all this whole two yeares
at home: for how little a way is it from
<hi>Mount-auban</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> from <hi>Paris</hi> to
<hi>Callis,</hi> from <hi>Callis</hi> to <hi>Douer?</hi> Truely
when I thinke of the land, it ſeemes about
an elle: in the Mappe a finger-breadth: in
the forme of the heauens, iust nothing.
Nor ſee I any reaſon why that <hi>France</hi>
ſhould hee held my natiue ſoyle more then
<pb facs="tcp:3850:13"/>
all <hi>Europe:</hi> for if you ſtand vpon diuerſity
of language, how many languages (I pray
yee) haue yee in <hi>Europe</hi> quite different
from the <hi>French?</hi> If the conditions of the
nations mooue yee, view not <hi>Europe,</hi> but
view the whole world, and euery Prouince
thereof, leaning to the qualities of thoſe
that adioyne vpon it, as the <hi>Polipus</hi> turnes
into the colour of euery ſtone ſhee comes
neere! O <hi>Beroaldus</hi> (quoth I againe) but
we do enuie at the licence you haue to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
trauell: wee (wretches) that like
Tortoyſes, are bound to our owne houſes,
whileſt you haue taken ſuruey of all the
worlds ſingularities, and now that you are
filled with their knowledge, you ſet them at
nought thus. Might I but view the Snowie
<hi>Alpes,</hi> or the ſhady <hi>Pyrenes,</hi> oh how much
ſhould I thinke my ſelfe beholding to mine
eyes at my reſting time, when all that I had
ſeene ſhould turne to my benefit, and ſtore
mine vnderſtanding with a freſh fraught
of knowledge! Ah how much (quoth <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roaldus)</hi>
doth abſence promiſe him that
would bee preſent, and how vaine are the
hopes that attend on ignorance! friend,
<pb facs="tcp:3850:14"/>
when I was at home, vnexperienced, I
thought as you do; but triall hath now taught
me to ſee mine owne ſimplicity. A trauell
of ſo ſmall toyle yeelds eaſie ſatisfaction:
and in this, your expectation ſhall exceede
your experience in all thoſe nouelties. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine
parts are ſo like ours, that you cannot
thinke them ſtrange to yee, though you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
ſaw them before. And what is there in
all the knowne world, which mapps, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
cannot inſtruct a man in, as perfectly
as his owne eyes? your England is deſcribed
by <hi>Cambden:</hi> what vnderſtanding man
is there, that cannot, out of him, make as
perfect a deſcription of any cittie, riuer, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument,
or wonder in all your Ile, as well as
if hee had viewed it in perſon himſelfe?
What part of <hi>Europe</hi> is there that affoords
more to a ſtrangers eye then is related by
one pen-man or other? The ſeuerall condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the people are all deſcribed already:
as farre as eyther pen or experience can ſet
downe: but neither can giue any vniuerſall
knowledge. The <hi>French</hi> are commonly called
raſh, the <hi>Spaniard</hi> proud, the <hi>Dutch</hi>
drunken; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the buſi-bands; the
<pb facs="tcp:3850:14"/>
               <hi>Italians</hi> effeminate; the <hi>Swethen</hi> timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roas,
the <hi>Bohemians</hi> inhumaine; the <hi>Iriſh</hi>
barbarous and ſuperſtitious: but is any man
ſo ſottiſh, as to thinke that <hi>France</hi> hath no
ſtaid man at all in it; <hi>Spaine,</hi> no meacock;
or <hi>Germanie</hi> none that liues ſoberly? They
are fooles (beleeue it) that will tie mens
manners ſo firme vnto the ſtarres, that they
will leaue nothing to a mans owne power,
nothing to the parents natures, nothing to
nurture and education. View this <hi>Pernaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
here, whereon we liue: Suppoſe here were
a Colledge of <hi>Italians, Spaniſh, French,
Danes, Dutch</hi> and <hi>Polacques?</hi> doe you
thinke to finde more varietie of diſpoſitions
in this company of Students, then you may
doe amongst your owne <hi>Engliſh?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Turne yee therefore which way yee
will, I cannot ſee how this halfe a foote
trauell can benefit vs any waye, excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that wee may reape ſome annimation
to learning by the ſight of ſuch great Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
as <hi>Whitaker, Raynolds, Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
Beza, Iunius, Lipſius,</hi> and ſuch
like as thoſe vvere. Indeede I holde,
that your <hi>Drake</hi> and your <hi>Candiſh</hi> were
<pb facs="tcp:3850:15"/>
trauellers, as alſo <hi>Sebaſtian Delcano,</hi>
the <hi>Portugheſſe,</hi> becauſe their voyages put
girdles about the whole world: Nay I will
allow <hi>Chryſtopher Colono</hi> that name
alſo, for his diſcouerie of the West <hi>Indies,
Franceſco Piccaro,</hi> and <hi>Almagro</hi> for
<hi>Peru, Hernando Magellano</hi> for the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luccaes,</hi>
and <hi>Sir Hugh Willoughbye</hi> for
his Northren diſcoueries: together with
all ſuch as eyther haue first found out vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne
regions, or haue brought them to
order. And truly (I will tell you two plaine)
my minde doth prompt me with ſome noble
enterpriſe of this kinde, ſuch as the world
might gaze at, and all poſterity record with
admiration. With that hee bluſht, and held
his peace, as if he had blabd ſome bold ſecret.
Yea <hi>Beroaldus</hi> (quoth <hi>Drogius</hi> to him) &amp;
dare you not ſpeake it out? doe you imagine
to torture our mindes with ſetting them on
worke vpon doubtfull inquiries, or is your
modeſt ſecret (hetherto ſo cloſely ſuppreſſed)
afraide to aduenture vpon ſo many eares at
once? Nay ſpeake what ere it bee, wee haue
cleere browes (looke you) open eares, and
faithfull hearts: nor can your vnknowne
<pb facs="tcp:3850:15"/>
enterpriſe come to light eyther vvith more
ſecuritie, or fitter occaſion. Well <hi>Drogius</hi>
well, (quoth <hi>Beroaldus)</hi> you take my ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
in no good ſence, but mixe it with
your coniectures, that though great
matters neuer goe but (like as Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
doe with their numerous traines) with
a great preamble of ambiguous tearmes;
yet that I ſhould not doe ſo, but vent a
pondrous conceite, a birth that my braine
hath trauelld a yeare with, all naked, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any praemonitions. In truth I reſolued
at the first to let you know it: marry not
with-out ſome graduall proceedings, and
materiall preparations, without which, I
know well how fond the vviſest proiect
doth commonly ſeeme: but now I ſee my
ſelfe chayned to a head-long diſcouerie
mauger my beard, vnleſſe I ſhould giue
you iust cauſe to call my loue to you both,
in queſtion. Wherefore you ſhall know it:
ſooner (I aſſure you) then I did intend,
but with no leſſe willingneſſe: Onely ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
you, that you haue already heard mine
intended premonition.</p>
            <p>It hath euer offended mee to looke vpon
<pb facs="tcp:3850:16"/>
the Geographicall mapps, and finde this:
<hi>Terra Auſtralis, nondum Cognita.</hi> The
vnknowne Southerne Continent. What good
ſpirit but would greeue at this? If they
know it for a Continent, and for a Southerne
Continent, why then doe they call it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowe?
But if it bee vnknowne; why doe
all the Geographers deſcribe it after one
forme and ſite? Idle men that they are,
that can ſay, this it is, and yet wee know
it not: How long ſhall wee continue to bee
ignorant in that vvhich vvee profeſſe to
haue knowledeg of?

more then female feare, this vaine careleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
that vvittingly and willingly robbes
vs of another world. What colour haue vve
for it? vvhat feare vve? ſhadowes, or our
ſelues? there is heauen, there is earth in
that continent, &amp; there is men, perhaps more
ciuill then wee are. Who euer expected ſuch

dreames of it; I will aſſay to diſcouer it.
Your enterpriſe <hi>Beroaldus</hi> (quoth I) is
great, and almoſt more then mortall
<pb facs="tcp:3850:17"/>
power can execute. Howeuer it ſucceede,
I applaude your generous ſpirit, as like your
owne: but as you ſaid, great matters, as they
require many praemonitions, ſo doe they
more premeditations. Haue you therefore
caſt your full account of the dangers, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
hopes, expences, and all other ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents
as muſt attend this your attempt?
There is heauen you ſay: there may bee ſo,
and yet you bee kept from the ſight of it by
perpetuall darkeneſſe.</p>
            <p>There is earth; but you may bee driuen
out of that by beaſts and ſerpents: There
are men: but perhaps you had rather want
their company, when you know them, then
haue it. If one of you <hi>Patagonian</hi> Giants
ſhould catch your and eate you quite vp,
where are you then my fine diſcouerer? It is
good thinking of thoſe things, but it is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
trying. O ſir (ſaith <hi>Beroaldus</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine)
you know not that the Cape of good
hope lies ouer againſt this land. We muſt
hope, and wee muſt dare. Thoſe bug-beares
of dangers at fit to fright babies: but they
anymate bolder ſpirits. If we ſhould ſticke
at them, wee ſhould neuer looke out at our
<pb facs="tcp:3850:17"/>
owne dores. That was the cauſe <hi>America</hi>
lay ſo long vnknowne, and had done ſtill
(for ought I ſee) but that GOD ſent a
<hi>Doue</hi> from Heauen, which plucking of an
Oliue branch from this Continent, taught
vs by that, that there was yet more land, and
leſse ſea then wee dreamed of: O how ſacred
ſhall his name beheld with all poſterity! His
ſtatue ſhalbe aduanced, for vs al to gaze vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
whilſt earth keepes her foundation. It is
as great a glory (thinke I) to bee called <hi>The

And why may not wee haue that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
and the like glory? I am the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited

What can be ſpoken more plaine, to point
out this diſcouery? Here did <hi>Drogius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie:
What Man? beware how you raiſe
ſo great a building on ſo weake a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Your <hi>Doue</hi> hath fulfilled your Poets
coniectures, all of them, alreadie. The
ſumme of yeares is now runne: <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi>
is that large continent. Dreame you of
any other either age, or diſcouery? I know
the generality of your opinion (quoth <hi>Bero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aldus)</hi>
but I doubt of the truth, for Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
are alwaies <hi>de futuro:</hi> and what if I
prooue the countrie <hi>America</hi> to be knowne
to former ages? If I doe, <hi>Senecaes</hi> wordes
are no preſage, but an intimation of a thing
done. Now I am fully perſwaded that ſome
part of theſe weſt <hi>Indies</hi> was that <hi>Ophir,</hi>
where <hi>Salomons</hi> and <hi>Hirams</hi> nauy had
their gold. For whereas there are fiue ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
opinioniſts touching this, <hi>viz. 1. Raba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,
Maurus</hi> and <hi>Nicholaus de Lyra,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
that <hi>Ophir</hi> was in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.
2. Volateranus,</hi> and <hi>Ortelius,</hi> auoutching
it to bee an Iſland in the <hi>Ethiopian</hi> Ocean,
from an apocryphall relation of one <hi>Lewis
Venetus; 3. Gaſpar Varerius,</hi> who affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb facs="tcp:3850:18"/>
all that was contayned in <hi>Pegu, Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi>
and <hi>Sumatra,</hi> to be whilom called by this
name. 4. <hi>Francis Vatablus</hi> whom <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>
alſo (as <hi>P. Martyr</hi> ſaith) did follow: who
ſaid that <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> was <hi>Ophir. 5. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam
Poſtelius, Goropius Becanus,</hi> and
<hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> all which auoutch direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that <hi>Ophir</hi> was this continent in which
<hi>Peru</hi> lieth. Of theſe the two laſt, and likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
make for vs, I care not which you take.
The firſt two, <hi>Varerius</hi> hath ouerthrowne,
horſe &amp; foote: to ad more were too ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
Sufficeth only that I proue him errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
in putting <hi>Pegu, Sumatra</hi> &amp; <hi>Malaca</hi>
for <hi>Ophir.</hi> And firſt, holy writ ſaith plaine,
that thoſe two nauies were two years out, in
each of their voiages to <hi>Ophir:</hi> but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpace
of 10. months, or 12. at the moſt, will ſerue
to paſſe and returne from the red ſea to <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matra:</hi>
how then can this propoſition of
time agree with his opinion? what can <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rerius</hi>
ſay to this: that nauigation was not
exact then, as the <hi>Portugalls</hi> haue made it
ſince, and therefore in ſuch a vaſt roome for
ignorance, the nauies might ſpend the more
in a wrong courſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:3850:19"/>
Well ſir, but how came <hi>Salomon</hi> to the
knowledge of this farre diſtant land? From
God you ſay, I beleeue yee. So then, hee that
taught him that there was ſuch a land, and
that there was gold in ſuch a land, and
aduiſed him to ſend thither, would not hee
(thinke you) ſhew him the right way the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?
Againe, the time of their being out is
alwaies ſet downe but one: at the end of
which they euermore returned, neither ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
longer, nor comming ſooner: which
proues the diſtance of the place, and not the
error of the ſailers. Laſtly, the very name
ſpeaketh for vs as plaine as may: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
do but tranſpoſe one letter, and they are all
one. Let mee therefore hold you for incredu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
obſtinates if you confeſſe not that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi>
was knowne long before <hi>Senecaes</hi>
time. You are victor <hi>Beroaldus,</hi> quoth I, and
may now lawfully triumph: But admit that
it was knowne to <hi>Salomon,</hi> and his naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators;
doth it follow therefore that it was
diſcouered to the whole world beſides, and
ſuch as had no commerce at all with the
<hi>Iewes?</hi> or might not the memory of it bee
vtterly extinct before the later times of
<pb facs="tcp:3850:19"/>
the <hi>Romaines?</hi> Which if it were, your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and <hi>Senecaes</hi> preſage are both ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne.
Nay nay, quoth <hi>Beroaldus,</hi> I am
not ſo eaſily diſheartened with ſhadowes of
reaſon. This ſit doubt of yours, giues mee the
ſtronger foote-hold. Hiſtory is not ſilent in
this diſcouery, but preſerues the memory of
it euen vnto the laſt poſterities of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi>
For you know that from <hi>Salomon</hi>
to the building of <hi>Carthage</hi> was little leſſe
then 150. yeares. But the <hi>Carthaginians</hi>
(as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> witneſſeth, nor can I beleeue
that they did this in their Citties infancie)
after a tedious nauigation did finde an Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
beyond the <hi>Gades,</hi> (which can bee
none but this) ſituate in the <hi>Atlantike</hi> ſea;
wherevpon they made a law (which is a true
ſigne that neither did they people it, nor the
reſt of the world, as then, commonly knew it)
that none ſhould euer ſaile thether againe;
fearing leaſt the wealthy and pleaſant ſoile
ſhould allure the Citizens to leaue <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi>
and go dwell there. Now the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
hauing this knowledge of it from <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi>
how ſhould it bee euer kept from
<hi>Rome?</hi> But ſirs, kicke againſt the truth as
<pb facs="tcp:3850:20"/>
long as you liſt, or yeeld to it as I doe: I am
moſt firmely perſwaded that <hi>Senecaes</hi>
large continent is yet vndiſcouered, and
ſtaies to yeeld vs this glorie, if we dare ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
on it. For my ſelfe; I am comming (my
world) after ſo many vowes, and delaies,
now I come at laſt, all fraight with hope and
confidence, either to vnmaske thee to <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi>
or to lay my bones in thee. And you
(my friends and fellowes) if there bee any
true vertue, or loue of glory in your breaſts,
goe and ſhare with mee in my fortunes in
this great enterpriſe. Shame goe with thoſe
frozen boſomes that affect nothing but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity

a good will. If yee bee men take that will
vnto yee, arme your ſelues againſt weake

iourney which may be perhaps, delightfull,
<pb facs="tcp:3850:20"/>
and cannot but proue glorious vnto vs how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer

you may perhaps enuy too late. Here
he ſtopt his ſpeech, and beheld vs with an
eye ſomewhat diſturbed. His pithy ſpeech
(whereof I cannot rehearſe the tenth part)
mooued vs much, and ſo did our deſires
of nouelty and glorie: briefely, wee aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and reſolued all to aſſay this great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couerie,
and embarked our ſelues in a ſhip
called <hi>The Fancie,</hi> taking our leaues of all
our friends and acquaintance.</p>
            <p>After three daies wee arriued on the
<hi>Belgique</hi> ſhores, and at the weekes end in
<hi>Aquitane:</hi> but <hi>Drogius</hi> ſtaied behinde
at <hi>Delfe,</hi> and <hi>Beroaldus</hi> left mee here
and departed vnto <hi>Monutauban,</hi> againſt
both their wills: expoſing mee to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion

their great expectation of this our diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
vnleſſe I would proceede, and aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
vpon all thoſe vnknowne perills

<pb facs="tcp:3850:21"/>

but I would needes forwards, and hauing

                  <p>This tombe is to bee ſeene in the
pallace of the Duke, who hath his
regalitie according to this firſt Dukes
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:3850:45"/>
inſtitution, not by ſucceſſion, but by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,
for there are foure chiefe lina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
or families in the land: The <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-chins,</hi>
the <hi>Bacon-choppes,</hi> the <hi>Wool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks,</hi>
and the <hi>Nimble-iawes:</hi> any one of
theſe foure houſes may ſtand for the
Dukedome, and vpon deſert obtaine it.
This now is the order of the election:
there is a yearely tilting ordained (not
any tilting with ſpeares, but a tilting of
barrells) whervnto euery one comes ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
with his teeth, all new ſharpened,
and to it they goe, where hee that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſeth
moſt meate, and lifteth moſt
meaſures of wine out of their pewter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaddles,
is not onely honoured with a
crowne of cluſtered vines, but further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more
is made Lord high Steward of
the <hi>Land,</hi> the Dukes next inferior:
which done, and the tournament en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
each one ariſeth (if hee can) and
laying his hand on the ſacred tombe
of dead Duke <hi>All-Paunche,</hi> taketh an
othe by the deities of <hi>Bacchus, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne;</hi>
and the reuerend <hi>All-Paunch</hi> to
performe his duety in this election
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:3850:46"/>
without any partiall dealing whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer.</p>
                  <p>Then they depart vnto the Theater
which is prepared for that daies vſe
(not too high for feare of beeing
tired ere they got vp ſtaires) and there
they take their places to behold this fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
election. Then firſt commeth
forth the new choſen Lord high Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and he bringeth in his hand a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

Diamonds, Rubies &amp;c. and this they

                  <p>Now firſt, the laſt yeares Duke puts
it on, and taketh the exact meaſure of

Hee is the man that with great accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations

his Cup-bearer, and vpon his

his Grace to drinke a health vnto the
people.</p>
                  <p>Hee takes it, and lifting vppe the
Lidde, beginnes an oration to the
people befitting occaſion, or if hee

                  <p>This Prouince is ſome-what larger
then <hi>Eat-allia,</hi> and what that hath in

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:3850:51"/>

runnes round about the Dukes Palace,
and as for the ſaltneſſe, the <hi>Philoſophers</hi>
of this countrie ſay it hath it not from

often-times falls vpon it. The firſt towne

became part of the ſuburbes of <hi>Cluſter-beg,</hi>
a pretty fine Cittie, walled about

ſome-what deeper of dye. This Cittie
ſtands in the bottome of <hi>Preſsing-dale,</hi>
(a valley ſo called) through the which
runnes a delicateriuer called <hi>Iuice,</hi> which
paſſeth along by three or foure pretty

ſtranger, a <hi>Letcheri-tanian</hi> borne,
who was bound for the Citie as well as I,
his name he told me was<note n="b" place="margin">An Italian word expreſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſing the noiſe that the wine maketh in running from the tap.</note> 
                     <hi>Cinciglion.</hi> He
(being acquainted with their faſhions)
brought mee ſecretly by night into the

ſhould neuer haue diſcouered of my
ſelfe. Their buildings are not much vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
the <hi>Eat-alls,</hi> but that the fronts of
their houſes are ſo wholy hidde with
ſpreading Vines, that had I not ſeene
the ſignes hang out on euery ſide, I
would haue ſworne I had beene in a
Vineyard and not in a Cittie: in ſadneſſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:3850:54"/>
it was a pleaſant ſpectacle. In the Market
place are all the meaſures hung vp in
chaines, ſealed with the Dukes ſtampe
on their tops, and by them, hangeth a
table of the lawes of the land, which
you ſhall haue truely ſet downe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.
The inhabitants go all naked, but
for a wreath of Vines about their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads.
But their skins are all carued with
figures, and painted after the maner of
the ancient <hi>Picts,</hi> and <hi>Brittons.</hi> One hath
himſelfe drawne into the forme of a
<hi>Centaure,</hi> another of a<note n="c" place="margin">A beaſt that is halfe like a Goate, and halfe like a Stag.</note> 
                     <hi>Tragelaphus,</hi> a

ſo perfectly like a flaggon, that if hee ſet
but his hands on his ſides you would
ſweare it were a liuing flaggon. I did ſee
one alſo ſo directly in the ſhape of a
Whale, that when hee vomited, no man
in the world but would haue taken him
for a liue Whale, ſpewing vp the <hi>Ocean.</hi>
I had a great affection to ſee the maner
of their publike feaſts, and yet not bee
ſeene by the citizens. So mine hoſte at
laſt agreed to performe my requeſt, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:3850:54"/>
ſatisfy my longing, mary hee gaue mee,
withall, certaine cautions of danger,
that might enſue if I were diſcouered,
and likewiſe informed me in ſome neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
points of behauiour: ſo hauing
mine inſtructions about me, I and mine
honeſt hoſte, my leader, got vs into the
Townes hall, in the euening, vnſpyed
of any. By and by come the feaſters,
and take their places, iuſt as the <hi>Eat-alls</hi>
doe (as you haue heard) onely they had
more drinke and leſſe meate. Euery
one had his purueyance at either el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bowe,
a piſſe-pott for his vrine on one
ſide, and a bowle for his vomite on the
other.</p>
                  <p>At firſt, they begin a ſacrifice to
<hi>Bacchus,</hi> their Generall <hi>God:</hi> not as the
<hi>Romanes</hi> did of old, with powring a
little wine vpon the ground; no, no,
farre more religiouſly, and with more
ſtately ceremonies. At the vpper end
of the table ſtands a ſtatue of <hi>Bacchus,</hi>
holding in his right hand a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous
great <hi>Goblett</hi> of ſuch weight,
that (as <hi>Virgill</hi> ſayde once) the left
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:3850:55"/>
hand is now and then faine to helpe her
ſiſter. Into this Goblet or ſtanding Cup,
the maiſter of the ceremonies in the
name of the whole company, powres an
hoggſ-head of wine, (it holds no leſſe I
can aſſure yee) which paſſing in pipes as
if it were in veines vnto his mouth, and
his t'other thing both at once, makes a
pretty ſhew as hee both piſſed wine and
ſpewed it, all in one moment. And this is
the houre-glaſſe proportioning the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of the feaſt, for when he leaueth
powring out, they muſt all leaue pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in, and that vpon paine of ſacriledge.
Then ſir comes me vp a ſeruice of ſhoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-hornes

red-herrings, Anchoues, &amp; Gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons

poſſibly tel whether they are ſooner filled

and then they ioyne hands faſt together,
and giuing a ſound ſhake or two, the
challenger aduanceth his moiſtened wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon,

little, or talke a few gentle words among
hands, but the pott is diſrobed of his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,

and then the tother anſwereth him at his
owne weapon. The ſecond courſe is not
very dainty, but howſoeuer, they moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten
it well with redoubled rouſes. Then
comes the fruite with the third courſe,
and that in truth is very rarely furniſhed,
which being almoſt finiſhed, and the
cloth being now thruſt vpon an heape,
the maiſter of the ceremonies cryeth

all bleere-eyed, and troubled
with the palſie, with goodly Chowles
about their necks and chinnes whereof
the mountainers of the <hi>Alpes</hi> and the

very good Painters, when drinke and

that you would thinke verylie (as <hi>Lucian</hi>

haue alſo ſome Poets amongſt them,
whom their principall neuer crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
with lawrell (becauſe that tree is a

theſe Poets are the very off-ſcum of the

filling all the tauernes in the town

the vſes of balets that the knights of the

had but one good Poet (as it is ſaid) in
an whole age, and hee was ſtarued to
death for telling truth out of ſeaſon.
They goe often to warre, in aſſiſtance of
the <hi>Eat-alls;</hi> but they neuer goe armed,
not ſo much as with an Iriſh ſteel-coate,
a ſhurt on their backes; their lances
are ſapplins of Elmes, ſharpned and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

(for ſtand well they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not)
it is admirable to behold both
their valour in fight and their fortune

that none muſt goe ſober to the field,

flew the pondrous oares about their

a couple of conquerors, who being too

                  <p>Well, at length we came a ſhore, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:3850:68"/>
found it a pretty ſweete towne in truth
(to giue it the due) marry it was both
paued with bottles, and roofed with le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
bougets. I doe not remember I
ſaw any attificer in all the towne but
letherne Iack-makers, and taylors for
Bottle-caſes; ſo that now I ſaw what vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance
the <hi>Eat-alls</hi> had for their hides.
The reaſon is, the men of this towne and
country, vſe no pure wine, as the other
<hi>Drink-alls</hi> doe, but certaine diſtilled wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
mixt with the ſtrongeſt grape they
can get, which are ſo forcibly hott, that
the brittle glaſſe cannot hold them, and
therefore they are driuen to fortifie
their bottles with letherne Ierkins, riuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
together with pitch and roſen. The
citizens are fiery of face, and cholericke
of condition, enuious, ſuſpicious, para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique,
and of a ſtaggering manner of
pace in their going: but that which is
moſt terrible of all, they drinke and they
breath nothing but meere flames. As
much cold water, or ſcarr-gut, as one of
vs will drinke, ſo much fire will one of
them take: that a man would verily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:3850:68"/>
when hee ſaw them, that they were
ſo many fire-drakes, or Saint <hi>Georges</hi> dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons.
I was in danger of water before,
but now I feared nothing but that I
ſhould be ſtifled with fire. So that I left
my companion in his oriſons vnto <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi>
(I loued him well, but I loued my
ſelfe better) the very next morning I got
me out of this <hi>Vulcans</hi> ſhop, for ſo it was,
and a very <hi>Cyclops</hi> forge, rather then a
Citie of <hi>Bacchus.</hi> Now being vpon my

for the gold, they did not reſpect it, ſo
that the <hi>Shrewſ-burgeſſes</hi> would demand
it when it was due: but for them to force
a louing creature, and one of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
towne-borne country-broode, with
ſtroakes and battes, to beare this burden
out of their land againſt his proper will

hard, nay to their iudgments intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
beſides that their quiet hereby ſtood

                  <p>You ſhall haue one of them directly
perſwaded that hee is dead, and lying all
along vnder the ſtoole, like a dead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſe.
If any one come to queſtion
him, hee flieth in his face with moſt
violent furie, ſuppoſing him ſome
Necromancer, that hath called his
ſoule backe againe from the dead, by
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:3850:97"/>
his magicall enchantments, and from
that time forwards,<note n="b" place="margin">So did one <hi>Piſander</hi> in a melancholy fit. <hi>Cael Rhodig. lib.</hi> 9. chap. 26.</note> he wanders all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

but if any of his fellowes take him

him a fury ſent from <hi>Pluto,</hi> to fetch back
the ſoule that lately brake away from

that euer was man; imagining his

is of opinion that he is become a

hunting for wormes, and turning vp the

him, and giue him but a little pricke,
hee preſently beleeueth himſelfe taken
by the Mole-catcher, and with miſerable
cries prepares himſelfe to bee hung vp
on the hedge. A third holds himſelf to
be <hi>Atlas,</hi> the worlds ſupporter; and ſo
ſtandeth immoueably ſtill, now and
then fetching a ſigh or two, ſometimes
lifting vp his ſhoulder, and ſometimes
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:3850:97"/>
ſhrinking it downe-wards: now when
hee hath ſwet a little with this exceſſiue
toile, if any one come and thruſt him
from his ſtation, he preſently falls flatte
downe on his face with roares and cries,
expecting euery moment when the
skies ſhould fall vpon him, and railing at
the wickedneſſe of man, that had ſo little
reſpect of his owne preſeruation, and
the ſafety of the whole world. Another
auowes himſelfe to bee <hi>Megaera,</hi> one of
the furies, &amp; affrighteth the paſſengers
with terrible geſtures: ſhaking his haire
(which he thinkes is nothing but ſnakes)
hiſſing, and running at them that come
by him, with open mouth: if hee catch

fuming with continuall ſacrifices to <hi>the
Deuill, and the Duke,</hi> offering the ſoule
to appeaſe the furie of the firſt, and the
body to ſatiate the couetouſneſſe of the
later; and for the bloud, they haue a
certaine Arte to keepe that from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelation,
and ſo caske it vp like <hi>Aligant,</hi>

the middeſt of this chappell runneth a

they ſcowre all the filth of the bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained

               <p>Theſe men doe neuer goe, but runne
altogether, and generally you ſhall
not miſſe to take them all on a ſweat.
But there are two ſtrange things, and
worthy obſeruation in this countrie,
the firſt is, you ſhall not finde one
man in this whole region, but hee is
either lame in body, or deformed in face:
which the more ſcarres that it beares,
the more beauty it is held to adde vnto
the bearer: and the ſecond is, that a man
of three ſcore yeares old, is here held for
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:3850:103"/>
a miracle. For it is more then extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
for any of them to attaine to the
middle age of man, they are fleſht ſo

It lieth in the very middeſt of all the

On the South it hath <hi>Fooliana the craggy:</hi>
on the Eaſt, <hi>the Fickle:</hi> on the Weſt, <hi>the
Deuoute:</hi> and on the North, <hi>the Fatt.</hi> The

peopled with ſlouthfull &amp; flegmatique
inhabitants; but the northren part ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
is poſſeſſed by more induſtrious and

haue beleeued that nature had beſtowed

vpon <hi>Fooliana the craggie,</hi> goe directly
like beaſts vpon all foure, nor doe they
know (ſilly things) any other way of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
There is no houſe in all this part of
the country: becauſe the inhabitants
neither can build any them-ſelues, nor
dare aduenture to come into any that
are built by others, leaſt they ſhould fall
vpon their heads. There are euery yeare
great multitudes of them ſtarued, and
ſtormed to death, in that they can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
make ready their meate, nor frame
themſelues apparell, nor beds: nay they
can ſcarcely ſpeake true ſence: not a
man of them that knowes his owne fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
nor his owne ſonne, nor wife: nor
how to returne the ſame way he came:
nor how to diſtinguiſh a Beare from a
Sheepe, or a Lion from a whelpe. Nay
you haue of them that ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not tel whether

<pb n="178" facs="tcp:3850:110"/>
ſo: and his ſpeech tends to the rayſing
of an high mountaine about the cittie,
for theſe ſubſequent vſes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt that the whole world might not

Second, that the cittie therby might
be more augmented and fortified. Third
that there might be better auoidance of
cold, by the warme ſeating of the Citty
within ſo high a mount: and for the
mount it ſelfe, thoſe that dwelt below
ſhould digge it out of the valley, and lay
it togither. And then ſhould there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge
built from that vnto the next
mount, by which the citty ſhould bee
furniſhed with neceſſaries. But then
ſteps vp another, and ſmiling, asked how
it were poſſible that a valley ſhould
bring forth a mountaine, but to allow a
poſſibility of that, to ſuffer a bridge to be
built were meere indiſcretion: for if a
carriage, or a traueller ſhould ſtumble
or looſe foote-hold thereon, there were
no way in the world for you but death,
yea and that (which is worſe) with the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:3850:110"/>
breaking of a legge or an arme: no, as
for my ſmall experience in ſtate affaires
(quoth hee) I would rather aduiſe thus
(graue <hi>Grandunſonians)</hi> to enterpriſe
a matter which to effect is not labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
and yet being effected, ſhall prooue
moſt glorious: ſo that beeing propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
I know that the well-willers of the
ſtate cannot chooſe but approue it: and
thus it is.</p>
                  <p>Euery man according to his ability
and the ſize of his houſe, ſhall erect a
ſpire vpon the toppe thereof, and vpon
the toppe, of that, ſhall aduance a Cock

ſhall bee mooueable, to follow and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe

in euery ſpire I would haue a clocke
to ſtrike hourelie: which beeing once
fully performed, O what pathetique ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit

to his proiect, ſo grauely, and ſtateſman

ſee it performed according to the intent
of ſuch a ponderous aduiſe: So that hee
that ſhall in his trauell hereafter, arriue

There is a double ledge of Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines

which lieth a plaine, full as iong, and this
is <hi>Fooliana the fatte:</hi> through which, the

his courſe, almoſt encircling the whole

what a goodly ranke of Cities are ſeated
on the Mountaines ſides, hauing the
proſpect ouer ſuch a fertile plaine, ſo
delicately watred and diuided into ſuch
a many cantons, all fraught with fatte
paſtures, and ſpacious champians. The

But this I am ſure of once, that
though it fill the noſtrils, it empties the

               <p>But for a truth the number of the

nere exceed the number of the villages:
beſides which, there is nothing but ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy
ſheddes, worſe then any <hi>Weſtphalian</hi>
Inne: nor is there any freeholder left in
all this countrie: the Cloiſters haue
got vp all the lands euery ſtraw-bredth,
to make the deities the better cheere.
Foure ſorts of buildings did I obſerue
in this ſoile: Temples, Monaſteries, Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitalls
and Cottages: for all thoſe that
are not profeſſed cloyſterers, are either
ſlaues or beggers. They are all of one
religion, mary they cannot tell of what:
but profeſſe ignorance, and neglect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
it is inough for them to follow
their fore-fathers, and to hold the places
whilom belonging to Saints, that is all
they care for. In their pace they make
continuall croſſes; one thigh comming
thwart another at euery ſtep, and ſo
makes the forme of a croſſe at euery
foote of ground they paſſe: And ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
do they cary their armes, folded in
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:3850:126"/>
croſs-like manner, as if they were all in
loues Melancholie. They haue goodly
Temples, yet downe vpon their knees
will they go in the plaine fieldes, if they
ſpy but any antique face vpon a ſtone,
or an old logge, or ſo: and then their
beades (which they beare vpon ſtrings)
muſt needes rattle ſome two and fiftie
times ouer. There is more Gods be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to this country, then there is men.
<hi>Varroes</hi> nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the Romane gods was
but halfe an vnite in reſpect of thoſe.
They make them of ſtone, wood and
lome: and ſome of them augment their
deities number, with adoration of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
hogges, and hounds. Euery daie
giues life vnto a new deity: and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
yee ſhall reckon two hundred,
made in one Temple vpon one day. And
here wee finde the olde <hi>Egiptian</hi> cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome
receiued, that men, whileſt they
liue, are naught ſet by, but dying, they
are entombed in honorable ſepulture.
800. pounds haue I ſeene beſtowed at
one funerall, and none of the greateſt
mans neither. In this land will I lay my
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:3850:126"/>

               <p>At thoſe obiects, beſides the tapers,
incenſes, bells, and bables that attend

there are two ſelect perſons bound by
the law to attend the bodie all the way

the flies from it, be it in winter
when the flies are all dead, and the
