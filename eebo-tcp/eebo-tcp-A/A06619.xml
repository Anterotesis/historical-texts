            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

What greater dishonour could happen to Diana, or to her Nimphes shame, then that there can be any time so idle, that shold make their heads so addle? Your chast harts my Nimphes, should resemble the Onix, which is hotest when it is whitest, and your thoughts, the more they are assaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with desires, the lesse they should be affected. You should thinke loue like Homers Moly, a white leafe &amp; a blacke roote, a faire shewe, and a bitter taste. Of all Trees the Cedar is greatest, and hath the smallest seedes: of all affections, loue hath the greatest name, &amp;

Shall it be said, and shall Venus say it? nay shall it be seene, and shall wantons see it? that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana the goddesse of chastity, whose thoughts are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies answerable to her vowes, whose eyes neuer glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced on desire, and whose hart abateth the poynt of Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pids arrowes, shall haue her virgins to become vnchast in desires, immoderate in affection, vntemperate in loue, in foolish loue, in base loue. Eagles cast their euill feathers in the Sunne, but you cast your best desires v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon a shadowe. The birdes Ibes lose their sweetnesse when they lose theyr sights, and virgins all theyr ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues with theyr vnchast thoughts, vnchast, Diana cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth that, that hath eyther any showe or suspicion of lightnesse.

I blush Ladies that you hauing beene heretofore patient of labours, should nowe become prentises to idlenesse, and vse the penne for Sonets, not the needle for Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plers. And howe is your loue placed, vppon pelting boyes, perhaps base of birth, without doubt weake of discretion. I but they are fayre.

                     <p>THis is the day wherein you must satis-fie Neptune and saue your selues, call toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your fayre Daughters, and for a Sacrifice take the fayrest, for better it is to offer a Virgine then suffer ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. If you think it against nature to sacrifice your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, thinke it also against sence to destroy your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. If you imagine Neptune pittilesse to desire such a pray, confesse your selues peruerse to deserue such a punishment. You see this tree, this fatall Tree, whose leaues though they glister like golde, yet it threatneth to fayre virgins griefe. To this Tree must the beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest


<pb facs="tcp:10263:19"/>
be bound do vntil the Monster <hi>Agar</hi> carry her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie, and if the Monster come not, then assure your selues that the fairest is concealed, and then your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey shall be destroyed, therefore consult with your selues, not as fathers of children, but as fauourers of your Countrey. Let Neptune haue his right if you will haue your quiet; thus haue I warned you to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and would wish you to be wise, knowing that who so hath the fairest daughter, hath the greatest fortune, in loosing one to saue all, and so I depart to provide ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies for the Sacrifice, and commaund you to bring the Sacrifice.

For if she be a May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den there is no hope of my loue, if a boy, a hazarde: I will after him or her, and leade a melancholie life, that looke for a miserable death.</p>

He told me a long tale of Octogessimus octauus, and the meeting of the Coniunctions &amp; Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, and in the meane-time he fell backwarde himselfe into a ponde. I askt him why he fore-sawe not that by the starres, he said hee knewe it, but contemnd it. But soft, is not this my brother Robin?</p>

I Haebe, poore Haebe, men will haue it so, whose forces com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund our weake natures, nay the Gods wil haue it so, whose powers dally with our purposes. The Egipti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans neuer cut their Dates from the tree, because they are so fresh and greene.

Fare-well life, vaine life, wretched life, whose sorrowes are long, whose ende doubtfull, whose miseries certaine, whose hopes innumerable, whose feares intollerable. Come death, and welcome death whom nature cannot resist, because necessity ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, nor deferre because destenie hasteth. Come Agar thou vnsatiable Monster of Maidens blood, &amp; douou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of beauties bowels, glut thy selfe till thou surfet, &amp; let my life end thine. Teare these tender ioynts wyth thy greedie iawes, these yellow lockes with thy black feete, this faire face with thy foule teeth. Why abatest thou thy wonted swiftnesse?

               <p>GOE all, tis I onely that conclude al. You Ladies may see, that Venus can make constancie ficklenes, courage cowardice, modestie lightnesse, working things impossible in your Sexe, and tempering hardest harts like softest wooll. Yeelde Ladies, yeeld to loue Ladies, which lurketh vnder your eye-lids whilst you sleepe, and plaieth with your hart strings whilst you wake: whose sweetnes neuer bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth satietie, labour wearinesse, nor greefe bitternesse. Cupid was begotten in a miste, nursed in Clowdes, and sucking onelie vpon conceits. Confesse him a Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, whom yee ought to regarde, sith it is vnpossible to resist, for this is infallible, that Loue conquereth all things but it selfe, and Ladies all harts but their owne.</p>
