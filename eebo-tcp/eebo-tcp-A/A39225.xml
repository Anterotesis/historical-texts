         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of the great zeale and care of our Brethren there to promote the Gospell, and of the blessing of God on their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, in the <hi>professed subjection</hi> of many poor soules thereunto.</p>
                  <p>Two great works we find here further undertaken in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to that service.</p>

Again, God manifested his acceptance of <hi>Noahs</hi> sacrifice, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising to drown the world no more, but gave him fruitfull times and seasons. God hath chastized us of late with such raines, as if he would drown us, and he hath drowned and spoiled a great deale of hay, and threatens to kill our Cattel, and for this we fast and pray this day; now if we offer a spirituall sacrifice, clean and pure as <hi>Noah</hi> did, then God will smell a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of rest in us, as he did in <hi>Noah,</hi> and then he will withhold the Rain, and give us fruitfull seasons.</p>

If any of you bury a child or a friend, then you will mourn, and fast too, for if we of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you meat, you will refuse it, yea you cannot eat, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause your heart is so full of sorrow: no matter for meat then, your tears, and sighs, and sorrows fill you
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:49162:13"/>
so, that you cannot eat; so that fasting is an help to mourning. Now this day is a day of mourning, and what doe we mourn for? not for a child or a friend, but a greater matter; we must mourn for our sins, and we should be so filled, and possessed with mourning for our si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Againe we fast that we might repent of our sins, and amend our lives, according to that <hi>Matth. 3. 8. bring forth therefore fruits meet for Repentance.</hi> This is a day of Repentance, we must therefore fast this day, so as becometh Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, therefore we must confesse our sins, and we must mourn for our sins, and we must forsake our sins, for these are works meet for Repentance. Again, <hi>we must not be like hypocrites in our fasting, for they disfigure their faces,</hi> and seem to men as if they mourned and fasted, and repented, but in their hearts they doe not so, and therefore God who knoweth what is in the heart, and seeth in secret, he doth know their hypocrisie, and so he knoweth our hypocrisie, if we come here, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to man as if we fasted, and yet in our hearts we fast not, if we do not mourn and repent for sin, we do not fast, God doth not account that to be a fast. Again, such as fast an hypocritical fast, they shall be sure to be rewarded, and what reward will God give to such as fast like hypocrites? I answer, that you may see what the wages of hypocrites is, <hi>Mat. 24, 51. shall cut him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sunder, &amp; appoynt him his portion with the hypocrites, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth,</hi> and this is evill wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: and therefore let us be moved, to keep a right fast this day, by repenting of our sins, and amending of our lives, and then the Lord will reward us openly, if he see that our hearts are right before him.</p>

And Iesus said unto them, can the children of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamber mourn, as long as the Bridegroom is with them, but the dayes will come, when the Bridegroom shall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them, and then they shall fast.</p>

to starve and kill our Cattel: also we have great sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse among us; so that many are dead: the burying place of this Town hath many graves, and so it is in all our Towns among the praying <hi>Indians.</hi> Also in our houses are many sick, and a great many are crazy, and weak, and not well; God threatneth to kill us, and therefore surely he is angry, and what maketh him an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry? we may be sure it is our sins, for we are great sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. This day is therefore a day of Repentance, of fasting, and of mourning. And what are we to doe in this day of fasting? <hi>Answ.</hi> We must search out all our sins, and with hearty Repentance forsake them. And when we goe about to search out our fins, we must remember that there be three places where we must search for sin: First, in our hearts; Secondly, in our words; 3ly, in our works and doings, and in all these places we find too many, but especially in our hearts; for there be evill thoughts, and the root sin [that is to say Originall sin, for so we call it in their language] and therefore it is a great work to search our hearts, &amp; find out the roots of sin: and if any doe say it is an hard work, and I know not how to doe it: I answer, it is true, it is hard work, but therefore we must take so much the more paines, and care to doe it, as we doe about hard works. If any say I cannot tell how to find out my sins: I answer, we must this day pray unto the Lord to help us to find them out, and to forsake them, for he knoweth them all.</p>
                              <p>Againe, another cause of our fasting this day, is to prepare us to make a church of Christ among us: and if you say what must we doe to prepare for Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estate.

I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but he that cometh after me is mightier then I, whose shooes I am not worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the holy ghost, and with fire.</hi> Where we see that <hi>Iohn</hi> did baptize them with water, but Christ doth baptize them with the holy ghost &amp; fire; we desire to be baptized by man, and man baptizeth with water, and that is a sign of Repentance; but we must look for the baptisme of Christ, &amp; he giveth us his Spirit, that is his baptizing.
