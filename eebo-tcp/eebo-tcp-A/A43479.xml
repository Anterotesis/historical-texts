         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

practised in our moderne Warres of these <hi>Vnited Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,</hi>
(the Nurcerie of the Milita) ought not to be accounted
the least: for what magnanimous, braue vailliant Generalls,
Chieftaines, Commandours &amp; Souldiers of all nations have
bin bred, and brought vp in this <hi>Academia,</hi> and Sede belli
is sufficiently knowne to the World, and what honorable
Actions, and memorable services they have done and performed, returning victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
out of the Feild, I leaue to the testimonie of Historie. Especially, the Almighty
God, the Lord of Hoasts hath so blessed your generous House, as namely, your
grand-father <hi>Prince William,</hi> your vncle <hi>Prince Maurice,</hi> both of immortall memorie,
and now your victorious Father, <hi>Prince Fredrick Henry</hi> our Captaine Generall, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments
for the defence of his afflicted Church, the true protestant Religion, &amp; for
the maintenance of the Privileges, &amp; freedomes of the Land &amp; hath crowned them
with an never-dying name, against the violence plotts and subtill <hi>machinations</hi> of one
of the mightiest Potentates of all Christendome. What glorious actions the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God hath wrought by them, for the deliverance of his Church and people
in this Land the <hi>Historigraphers</hi> of our times striue as with Trumpets to sound forth
their fame. For if wee cast our eyes backward to times past, &amp; the beginnings of our
Warres, when this State consisted but in a handfull of people, and a few Townes
and were in great distresse, and compare it with the State of the Land as it is now,
we must acknowledg how wonder-fully God hath blessed, and protected these
Countries against all the Tyrannie, and treacherie of the Duke of <hi>Alva,</hi> the Bishop
<hi>Granvelle,</hi> and diverse other Spanish Gouvernours, &amp; that he by his out stretched
Arme, hath extenpsed the Limits, &amp; bounds of these United Provinces, even (as it
were) from the Sunne-rysing, to the Sunne setting, and what hath all the <hi>Peruvian</hi>
Gold, and the <hi>Topazan</hi> Silver availed them, wee maye therefore truely say with the
Apostle, <hi>If God be with vs, who can be against vs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:96541:3"/>
Againe, if wee consider what God hath done for this Land of later yeares, it is a
wonder in our eyes how remarkeably &amp; with what good successe he hath blessed
the able <hi>Conduct,</hi> and <hi>dessignes</hi> of his highnesse your Father: for in the beginning of
his <hi>Generallship</hi> did he not take in <hi>Groll,</hi> &amp; <hi>Oldenzeel,</hi> and that <hi>heauen-blessed</hi> Surprisall of
<hi>Wesel,</hi> even when the Ennemy was entred almost into the bowells of this Countrie
&amp; iust at that time, when his highnesse was engaged so deepely at the Seige of the
<hi>Bosch,</hi> and carryed that invincible towne, against the expectation of all men? The
yeare after <hi>Rhyenbergh,</hi> and then became master of the strong towne of <hi>Mastricht,</hi>
&amp; took it before the noses of two great armies, which lay betweene vs and home,
then his and your owne citty of <hi>Breda,</hi> within seauen weekes &amp; a day, after wee putt
spade into the Earth, and brake ground towards it, whereas Marquis <hi>Spinola</hi> lay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
a whole yeare before it. And last of all the strong Castle &amp; Howse of <hi>Gennep,</hi>
which did so much annoy these Countries; These <hi>victories</hi> and <hi>Lawrils</hi> I haue briesly
related, to refresh your highnesse memorie withall, &amp; to the ende, that wee may giue
the glorie and praise vnto God for them.</p>
            <p>As for my self, J haue seene these things, &amp; haue serued this Land two and fortie
yeares, and learned some experience in these Warres, which made me take penn in
hand, to writ the <hi>Principles of the Art Militarie, practised in these Warres,</hi> first vnder the
<hi>Conduct</hi> of your Uncle <hi>Prince Maurice</hi> of blessed memorie, as now also vnder your
victorious Father for the instruction of such English Gentlemen, &amp; Souldiers, who
are willing to come into the States seruice, &amp; for the informing of their Iudgments
the better, &amp; with a great deale of labour, charg, and paines haue represented this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

showne one of my three parts to his highnesse your Father, it pleased him in your
presence to giue mee encouragement, to turne my English bookes into <hi>Netherdutch.</hi>
In obedience whereof, I translated my first part for the exercising of a foote Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie,
and a troupe of Horse (and God willing intend to doe the other two parts in

            <head>THE
OFFICERS AND DVTIES BELONGING
TO A FOOTE COMPAGNIE THROVGH ALL THEIR
degrees, from a private Souldier to a Captaine as followeth,
And first.</head>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Of a Centinell, or a private Souldier.</head>
               <p>A Centinell or a private Souldier ought to uuderstand well his duty, to come to his squadron, or company
at seasonable times, at the drummes beating, or otherwise, or when they are to draw in armes, and to set
the <hi>paradoe.</hi> To be very vigilent, and carefull upon his centinell-ship, &amp; to have as many eyes about him
as <hi>Argus</hi> had, suffring no man in the night to passe without crying <hi>Qui valá</hi> &amp; calling his <hi>Corporall</hi> to take the
word, un lesse he be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to come in silently. He must also take delight in the handling, &amp; vse of his armes
and see that he keepes them fixe, neate, and cleane, and goe handsomely in his cloathes. He must play the good
husband, and menage well that little meanes he hath.</p>
               <p>In marching or standing, he must have a singular care to keepe his ranke and file, &amp; not to stirre out of it
(without command) yea if he were sure to kill an enemy: hee ought also in fight, and in the day of battell, to
hearken well to his officers command, that when his officer may fall, or cannot be heard in a charge: he may be
acquainted with the sound of the drumme, when it beates a march, a charge, or a tetreate. He must not be given
to sharking, and oppression, but as <hi>Saint Iohn Baptist</hi> teacheth us in the Gospell, Luk. 3. 14. <hi>to do violence to no
man, neither accuse any falsly, &amp; be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent with his wages,</hi> he must be no Drunkard, whoremaster, or theefe, knowing
how honorable his profession is, &amp; how deare his reputation should be vnto him; but ought rather to arme
himsele with these christian vertues, the feare of God, praying morning and evening, and with <hi>Moses, to number
his daies that he may apply his heart to wisedome,</hi> hee should of all men be prepared to welcome death, seeing that a
bullet in a moment, may send him from earth to heaven. Morever, he must be diligent, active, sober, patient,
couragious, discrete, and curteous. Carefull nesse and labour will exercise him, and fortitude, with valour wil
teach him to execute, &amp; suffer patiently all fategations of the warr.</p>
               <p>To conclude, I would have a gentleman, and a souldier ambitions of his preferment, and advancement:
knowing how many brave Generalls, and commanders, even from private souldiers (passing through all the
degrees, &amp; offices of a souldier) have raised their advancement, thinking that he may also come to the like height
of honour, withal remembring how many worthies, Emperours, Kings, Princes, Dukes, Earles, Nobles, &amp;
gentlemen have been of this honourable profession, &amp; what <hi>Heroick,</hi> &amp; brave actions they have performed,
how many brave Battells they have fought &amp; what victoires they have gained, leaving in history <hi>Traphes of</hi> their
memorable actions, to eternize their everliving memory to posterity.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Of a Gentleman of a Company.</head>
               <p>IN a company of foot, there are also Gentlemen, especially in a Generalls, or Coronels company, they ought
to haue many brave gentlemen of quality, valiant, and capable of perferment, when the Generall, or coronel
shall find them worthy, and deserving.</p>
               <p>The first duty then required in a gentleman, or private souldier is obedience, as appeared by the <hi>Centurion,</hi> in
his answere to our Saviour in the holy Gospel, which teacheth us obedience, saying, <hi>I am a man under authority
having souldiers under me, and I say to this man goe, &amp; he goeth, &amp; to another come, &amp; he commeth, &amp; to my servant do
this, and he doth it, Math.</hi> 8. 9. For without this a whole army is worth nothing, &amp; to this vertue also, he must
joyne love, &amp; respect to his Captaine, &amp; superiour commandour.</p>
               <p>A Gentlemans duty at his first entrance into the profession of a souldier, following a Generals, or coronels
company, is to stand centinell for a moneth, to learne the first degree of a souldier, that he may be the better
able to command others, when he is advanced. In places of danger, either in the field, or approaches he is to lye
<hi>perdu,</hi> with his pistoll, and sword, &amp; not to budge from his place, till he be relieved: not to retreate for one man,
but in case of more, then to fall back to the fecond, &amp; discovering an enemy comming off betimes &amp; silently,
hee must give the <hi>Alarme so,</hi> that the <hi>Corps de gard,</hi> or company may be provided to defend them selves.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman also is to goe the Round with the captaine of the watch, or his fellow-gentlemen, either in field
or in garrison, to give the corporall of the guard <hi>the word,</hi> and to charge the centinells to looke well about them.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Of a Barbier Chirurgian to a Company.</head>
               <p>THere ought to be in a Company, a good <hi>Barber Chirurgian,</hi> both to trime the souldiers, &amp; to have skill in <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rurgerie,</hi>
that when the company watches in approaches, and guards, where there is danger, he may be at
hand (in the absence of the <hi>Chirurgian</hi> of the Regiment) to bind up &amp; dresse hurt, and wounded men, in doing

<pb facs="tcp:96541:4"/>
and vigilant, and to have these three qualities, a wise man, a man of spirit, and a man of courage, for a good Sarjant
is a great help to his captaine, and other officers, in helping to execute their commands. He must be also able, &amp;
sufficient to teach the souldiers the true and perfect use of their armes, his duty is to march upon the flanke of the

               <head>Of a Lieutenant.</head>
               <p>FIrst, it may be demanded, why a <hi>Lieutenant</hi> is so called, and the reason wherefore this name is given him. A
<hi>Lieutenant</hi> then is a French word compounded of <hi>Lieu</hi> a place, and <hi>tenant</hi> the participle of the present tense,
which signifieth in English, holding, or keeping, from whence he taketh his name, and is as much, as if one shold
say, a <hi>Lieutenant</hi> is he, which holdeth up, and supplieth the place of his Captaine or Governour. He is also called
in the Germane tongue <hi>Lieutenampt,</hi> which is as much to say, as having <hi>the charge, or office over men:</hi> because that
in the absence of his superiour, or his captaine, his office, and quality importeth as much, as if the Governour, or
captaine were present himselfe, and therefore <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> being a name rightly imposed upon him, he is to take
care, order, &amp; governe the company, and ought to be honoured, obeyed, and respected, as if the captaine himselfe
were present. Hence it is also that a King hath his <hi>Viceroy,</hi> a Prince his <hi>Administratour,</hi> a Potentate his <hi>Marshall,</hi>
or <hi>Chancellour,</hi> a Lord his <hi>steward,</hi> and a Coronell, or Governour, his <hi>Lieutenant Coronell,</hi> or <hi>Lieutenant Governour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Lieutenant then must be an able, and sufficient man, capable of his charge, and experienced in the warrs,
understanding the duty of a Captaine, because he is to execute it in his absence, and to be an ease unto him.</p>
               <p>He is to receive all orders, charges, &amp; commissions from his captaine, assuming no authority to himselfe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
in the absence of his captaine: for it is certaine that every military charge, ought to go by order, and to bee
received from his superiour Commander.</p>
               <p>When it is required, hee is to give his captaine wise counsell, and to advise, and consult with him for the good of
the company, especially in the time of action, and in matters of importance.</p>
               <p>He ought also by his command to appease quarrels, between souldier, and souldier, not to be partiall, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
one man more then another, for it is a point of iustice, to compose a quarrell, and to give satisfaction to the
party interressed, in so doing, hee shall support his command and gaine himselfe reputation. But in a matter of
importance he ought to acquaint his captaine therewith, that he may punish the offender, by committing him
eitheir to prison, or causing him to give satisfaction to the gentleman or souldier wronged, and that for the avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of blood-shed.</p>
               <p>A Lieutenant also must know how farre his authority extends in the presence of his captaine, and that his cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
honour and reputation ought to be as tender and as deare unto him as his owne.</p>
               <p>In his captaines absence, he is to governe the company wel, to take care that it be duely exercised, to command
the inferiour officers, as the sarjants, and corporals to do their duties, to make them teach the souldiers the perfect
use of their armes, that when they shall come to be excercised by his capt, or himselfe, they may be in a readinesse.</p>
               <p>When his captaine excerciseth his company himselfe, his place is then in the Reere of the company, to see that
the words of command, which is given by his captaine in the Front, be duely performed, and executed by the
souldiers in the reare: likewise in marching his captaine being present, he is to bring up the reere of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
and in his absence to lead it, in the Front to the <hi>gards,</hi> and <hi>paradoe,</hi> and to see that every souldier do their duty
upon their guards, and thus much briefly for a Lieutenant.</p>

head man from the word <hi>Haupt,</hi> which signifieth a Head, and from the Latine word <hi>caput,</hi> from whence the
name of a Captaine is derived in French, English and Dutch. For, as the Head is the principall member that
governes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and rules the body, and unto which all the other membres are subordinate; so likewise the officers,
&amp; souldiers of a company ought to governe, and carry themselues, according to the charge, and command of
their Captaine.</p>
               <p>A Captaine then having so honourable a place, as to be the chiefe of a company ought to be very capable of
his charge, and as he ought to carry himselfe with austerity, and gravity in the point of his command, that he may
be obeyed, feared, and respected of his souldiers; so should hee also carry himselfe towards them, as a loving, &amp;
kind father (seeing they must live and die together) in paying them duely, in helping, and relieving them in their
wants, nesessities, and sicknesses, neither must he be giuen to coveteousnesse in keeping back from them,
that which is their due.</p>
               <p>And as he is to love, countenance, and to make much of such souldiers of his company, as carry themselves
bravely and stoutly in the face of their enemy, which deserve well, seeking by all meanes to advance such, it will
give encouragement to others to do the like: so ought he also to punish vice severely, quarrellers, and offenders,
for the good and example of others.</p>
               <p>A Captaine should also be religious, loyall to his Prince &amp; country that he serves, just, temperate, liberall,
wise and discreet, valliant in the field before the face of his enemy: valliant in townes and forts besieged, and for
his honour, never to give consent in yeelding up any place, till it be past reliefe, &amp; that there is no possibility to
hold it out any longer.</p>
               <p>A Captaine also ought to instruct, &amp; informe his souldiers in the point of their duties, to traine them up, &amp; to
exercise them well in the use of their armes, aswell himselfe as the officers that are under him, &amp; to see that they
readily obey, and execute his commands, which is the life of warre, and one of the principall things, required
both in a Captaine and a souldier.</p>

            <p>A good muskettier that is ready, and well made by his officer, will fall naturally and gracefully to the

marching before he comes to present.</p>

his musket fast, and hard to his shoulder will keepe it fast from recoyling, &amp; resting firme vpon
his right legge will give fire.</p>

come vp to give fire.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:96541:25"/>
Moreover, if an Enemy should appeare on either your right, or left flank, and that you
resolue to maintain your ground, and would gaule him from either flank: it is performed
by giving first this word of command <hi>To the right or left hand,</hi> which you please, and then
making an interval of 6 foot distance between the two middlemost leaders of the halfe
files, e &amp;, for the halfe rank on the left hand, marked a b c d and e do fall away between
the files to the Reere before the pikes and the half rank on the right hand k i g h &amp; f,
on the right flank likewise, you may giue fire from either, or both flankes, as you list.</p>
               <p>Again if an Enemy should shew himself in your Reere, the like is done by giving this
term of derection, <hi>To the right hand about,</hi> and having given fire upon them, fall away to
the place, where the front stood, even in the same manner as you did before.</p>
               <p>The manner of giving fire marching and advancing towards an Enemy is performed,
as this figure following represents.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>In advancing towards an Enemy, two Rankes must alwaies make ready together, &amp;
advance ten paces forwards: before the bodies, at which distance, a Sarjant (or when the
body is great some other Officer) must stand, to whom the Musketteirs are to come up
before present, and giue fire. First, the first ranke, and whilest the first Ranke giues fire, the
second Ranke keeps their muskets close to their pannes guarded: and assoone as the first
are falne away, the second presently presents giue fire, and fall after them. Now, assoone as
the two first rankes do moue from their places in the front, the two rancks next it must
unshoulder their muskets, and make ready: so as they may advance forward ten paces,
as before, assoon as ever the first two rankes are fallen away, and are to doe in all pointes
as the fmorer. So all the other rankes through the whole company, or division must doe
the same by two one after an other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:96541:25"/>
A way how to giue fire retreating from an enemy, which is performed after this sort
as this figure following shows</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>As the troupe marcheth, the hindermost rank of all, keeping still with the troupe <hi>maketh
ready:</hi> and being ready the souldiers in that ranke turne altogether to the right hand, and
giue fire, marching presently away a good round pace to the front &amp; their place themsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves
in a Ranke together iust before the front. Assoone as the first Ranke turneth to giue
fire, the Ranke next makes ready and doth as the former and so all the rest.</p>
               <p>Last of all the troupe, or whole wing of Muskettiers makes ready altogether standing
and the first Ranke without advancing, giues fire in the place it standts in &amp; speedily as
may be yet orderly falles away the Rankes doing the same successiuely, one after another.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:96541:26"/>
A manner how to giue fire, either from the right or left hand flanke, as these 6 files of
60 Muskettiers demonstrates.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>To the right hand, present, giue fire, Captaine, to the left hand, present, giue fire.</p>
               <p>The Demonstration.</p>
               <p>The company or division marching, the outermost file next the enemy are commanded to make ready, keeping still
along with the Bodie, till such time, as they be ready, &amp; they turne all to the right, or left hand, according to the fight of
their Enemy, either upon their right or left flanke, and giue fire all together: when thy haue discharged they stirre not,
but keepe their ground, and charge their peeces againe in the same place they stand. Now assoone as the aforesaid file
doth turne to give fire, the outmost next it makes ready, alwaies keepeing along with, the troupe, till the bringers vp be
past a little beyond the Leader of that file that gave fire last, and then the whole file must turne and giue fire an doe in
all points, as the first did, and so all the rest one after another. A Sarjant or (if the troupe be great) some better qualified
Officer must stand at the head of the first file, and assoone as the second file hath given fire, and hath charged, he is to
lead forwards the first file vp to the second file, and so to the rest one after an other till he hath gathered again the whole
wing, and then he is to ioyne them againe in equall front with the pikes.</p>

and hath noe great experience, yet time and service will teach it him, and afterward make him am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious

for his deserts hath raised himself from inferiour degrees as from a Corporall &amp; a Corner, to this charge
wherein he is now, and from it to make himself fitt for higher preferment. He is a great helpe and
an Assistant to his Captaine, and therefore beares the name of <hi>Lieutenant,</hi> who supports and keepes vp
his Captaines place and authority, and who in his Captaines absence hath absolure commannd over the
Troupe. It is his office also to prevent, and compose quarrels and disputes, arising among the Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
of the Troupe, to carrie a severe hand over the willfull, and obstinate offendours by punishing
them toundlie for the exsample of Others, and to countenance favour, and encourage those that carrie
them selves worthely, and to discountenance malefactours, till they are sorrie for their disorders and
offences. Moreover he is to giue charge to the Corporals that every man manages, and keepes his horse
in a readinesse, that they keepe their armes neate and cleane, and their Pistols, and Carrabins sixe, and
to exercise the squadron himself in the feild or vpon their guards. Hee ought also to be a good Guide,
and to know well the passages, and avenues of a Countrie for the expediting of a sudden surprize.</p>
               <p>His place when his Captaine is present, is to bring op the <hi>Reere</hi> of the Troupe, causing the Horsemen

Comming to fight either in Battell, skirmish, or ortherwise, when his Captaine and Cornet is to
give a charge vpon an Ennemie, he keepes him self alwaies in the Reere with his sword drawne, to
animate, and encourage the Souldiers to fall on; and if any one of them should play the Coward, break
out of his rank, or run away, if he should kill him, he hath the mends in his owne hand, and the
Lieutenant maye wel answere it to his chiefe: for such a coward, or faint hearted souldier, by his euill
exsample showes others to runaway, which maye not onely be the overthrouw of the Troupe, but
also of a whole Regiment. His dutie is also to visite the guards, and to see that the centinels discharge
well their duties, and to give Commaund to the Corporals that they be duely relieved. That vpon
the sight of an Ennemie they come in orderlie, and guie the <hi>alarme</hi> betimes, that the Troupe maye

               <head>Of a Captaine.</head>
               <p>The Commaund, and charge of a Captaine of a Troupe of Horse is very honorable, and it ought to
be given to a man of respect, and qualitie, and one that is descended of a noble birth, whose valour, and
worth maye be answerable thereunto. He ought also aboue althings to be religious, fearing God,
temperate, moderate, just, Continent, wise, and discreete, curious in the choise of his men, and horse,
and to see that they be well managed, readie, and his Troupe well exercised, That they carrie themselves
vaillantly vpon service, in the face of the ennemie, and to be carefull, and vigelent vpon their watch,
Countenancing the good, and puinshing the badd. In doeing where of, these Christian vertues will
gaine him honour, loue, and respect, not onely amonge those of his Troupe, whome he Commaunds,
but also of his Chiefs, and all other men besieds.</p>
               <p>But if a Captaine either of Horse, or foote be debauched, leads an intemperate, and a disorderlie life,
giuen to covetousnesse, lucre, and gaine, he gives an ill exsample to those, whome he commaunds:
for if he himself doth commit such vices, how can he fasten a reproofe vpon a Souldier, or how can he
with a good conscience, punish that fault in his souldier, whereof he is guilty himself? for surely a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
being the head of a Compaine (from whence his name is derived) who governes him self well,
and leads an vn blame able life, guies a good exsample to his inferiour officers, and the souldiers of his
Compaine, who lives vnder his Commannd.</p>
               <p>He ought likewise to observe, and keepe punctually all the orders and Commaunds given him by
his Generall, to be with his Troupe at the <hi>Rendevous</hi> vpon the time appointed. To respect and obey his
<hi>Chiefes,</hi> and Superiour Officers. He is vpon all occasions to be first on Horseback, and vpon all ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
to carrie himself couragiouslie in the face of his Ennemie, to showe noe signe of feare in the
greatest danger, least he should give discouragement to his souldiers. He ought to take notice of
those souldiers vnder his Commannd, who carrie them selves vailliantlie, and couragioustie before
their Ennemies, to encourage them, and to reward them according to their deserts, and to take notice
of the names and surnames of everie Gentlemen aud Souldier of his Troupe, and sometimes to take the
advise of some old experienced souldiers of his Compagine. He ought not to suffer the Horsemen of
his Troupe to ravage, and spoile the Countrie, nor to pillage, and plunder the poore husbandmen and

to a Troupe of Horse, it resteth now that wee come to the arming of them as followeth. In a <hi>Cuirassier</hi> then is required, that he be a man of an able bodie, who is mounted
vpon a strong, and a lustie horse, that he hath on a good buff-gerkin, a short sword, or
Coutlase by his side, a skarff about his armes, and bodie of his princes coullour, to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
him from his Ennemie coullour vpon any service, or in the daie of battell.</p>
            <p>He ought to be mounted upon a stronge, and a lustie horse, or Gelding, which is fiueteene palmes
high, according to the measure there of ordayned by the States <hi>Edict,</hi> namelie, to meate his height with
a cord of that length, beginning from his fore-hoofe vpwards to his shoulder blade, and soe to the lower
part of his maine, and likewise to be provided with a good Sadle, and Bridle, with two good pistolls
hanging at his sadle bowe, in two strong pistoll Cases, the length of the pistoll barrils, being at the
least foure and twenly ynches long, carrying a bullet of twentie in the pound, and of 24. which will
roule in to his pistoll.</p>
            <p>For his Armes about his bodie, he is first armed with a close helmet or a Cask pistoll proofe vpon his
head, 2. with a Gorget about his neck, 3. His brest and back peeces, which ought to be pistoll proofe, 4.
His Pouldrons and vambrases his <hi>Guard de reines,</hi> 5. his gandes, 6 his Cassets or thigh peeces reaching
from his girdle beneath his knees, and <hi>(as is said)</hi> two pistolls hanging at his saddle, and thus a <hi>Curassier</hi>
is armed <hi>decap en pied</hi> at all points even from the head to the foote.</p>
            <p>The armes of a <hi>Harqut bussier,</hi> is lighter, to wit, first with a Cask open before. 2 with a gorgett brest
and back peeces, which ought also to be pistoll proofe, a good <hi>Carabine</hi> hanging at his belt about his
bodie, where of the length of the barrill ought to be at the least three foote longe, which will carry a
rowling bullett of 17 in the pound, haveing his Touchboxe, and Cartouch all in a readinesse, provided
also with a good Horse 15 palmes high &amp; well managed, with a good Sadle, Bridle, Coutlace, and a skarff

               <head>Of the managing of his Horse.</head>
               <p>A <hi>Cuirassier,</hi> and a <hi>Harquebussier</hi> being thus armed, It is very needefull, that a horseman be skillfull
in the well managing, and makeing or his horse readie for service, and to bring him to his commaund
and obedience, namely, to teach him to pace, trott, gallop, and to runne a full <hi>Careere,</hi> how he is to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
to stopp, and goe backward, and to turne and wheele with readinesse, to which hand his Rider
shall please. Now to bring his horse to this, and to learne him to turne and wheele with dexteritie, he
must often vse him to ride the ring, first with a greater circumference, and then litle and litle by lesser
degrees<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as first vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his pace, then vpon his trot, and so to the gallop and Careere. These things he maye
be taught by using the hand, legg, and voice. For the hand (observing not to move the arme, but
onely the wrist) if yow would have him to face to the left hand, then a litle motion of the litle finger
on that rein, and a touch of the left legg (without vsing the spurr) doth it, but if to face or turne to the left
about, a harder, &amp;c. If yow would have him to trott, then yow are to move both your leggs a litle for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
if for the gallop to move them more forward, and to move your bodie by litle &amp; litle forward
with it. After everie motion performed, it were good to keepe him a while in that motion, as when
yow bid him stand to stand a while &amp;c. Also it were not a misse after every thing well done, to give
him some bread, or grasse as a reward. For the voice yow maye vse the words <hi>Advance, Hold, Turne,</hi>
or the like, but because the voice cannot alwaies be heard, it were good to use him chiefly to the motions
of the hand and legg. It wilbe also very vsefull to teach him to goe side waies: this he maye be brought
vnto, by laying his Provender some what farre from him in the manger, and by keeping him from tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96541:29"/>
his head towards it. He must also be often vsed to the simell of Gun powder, the sight of fire, and
armour, and the heareing of short, drumms and Trumpetts, &amp;c. and that by degrees and with dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.
<hi>When</hi> he is at his oates (a prettie distance from him) a litle powder maye be fired, and so
neerer to him by degrees, yow maye also shoote of a pistoll some distance off, and so neerer and neerer.
In like manner, ye may use him to a Drumme or Trumpet. The groom maye some times dresse him
in armour, and he maye be vsed (now and then) to eate his oates from the drumme head. It will also
be very vsefull to cause a muskettier to stand at a convement distance, and both of yow to give fire
vpon each other, and there vpon to ride vp closse to him, also to ride him against a compleate armour,
so set vpon a stake, that he maye over throw yt, and trample it vnder his feete: that so and by such
other meanes your horse (finding that he receiveth noe hurt) maye become bolde to approach any
obiect. He maye also be used to mountanous and uneven waies, and be exercised to leap, Swimme,
and the like. Thus farr Captayne Cruso who hath wrote worthely of this subject in his 27 Chapter pag. 34 &amp; 35. And he that desireth further directions for the art of rydings and managing his horse, let him
read <hi>Monsieur Pierre de la Noüe</hi> in his Cavallerie <hi>Françoise &amp; Italienne,</hi> also the <hi>Instruction du Roy de France

Commaund, and the demonstration answering to the number of everie
figure, as they are sett downe by Captaine Cruso in his 29
chapter, and represented by figure.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is to be supposed, that noe <hi>Cuirassier</hi> or <hi>Harquebussier,</hi> will presume to mount on
horseback, or repaire to his Cornet, before his pistoll, Harquebuse, or Carabine be
spanned, primed, and laden: and his Cases furnished with Cartouches, and all other
Equipage belonging to himself, his horse, and armes made fixe and in a readinesse.
The first figure then showes a horseman how he is to mount on horseback, and
takes both reins hanging in a loose position over the Horse neck, &amp; vpon the pum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell
of the Saddle, and first laies hould on the ends of the reins aboue the button
in his right hand, and with the thumbe, and the two first fingers of that hand, draws them to an even
length. Then putting the litle finger of his left hand, betwixt both reins vnder the button, with the
other three fingers of the same hand on the further rein, and his thumbe on the neere side of the button
to graspe both reins, that so (before he endeavour to mount) he maye have his horse head in ballance
and at commaund: then grasping the pummel of the sadle with his left hand, and standing with his
full bodie to the horse side, and just betwixt the bolster, and cantle of the sadle, alwaies on the neere
side of the horse, with the help of his right hand, he shall putt his left foote into the left stirop, &amp; with
his right hand takeing fast hold on the highest part of the Cantle behinde, he shall (with the help of
both hands) gently (yet stronglie, and in a right posture without inclyning his bodie to either hand)
raise himself untill he maye stand <hi>Perpendicular</hi> vpon his left foot, and then putting over his right legge
cast and place himself in the sadle.</p>
               <p>2. VVith the right-hand he is to turne downe the Caps of the pistoll cases.</p>
               <p>3. He is to drawe the pistol out of the Case with the right hand, and alwaies the left pistoll first) and
to mount the muzzle of it, as in posture 15.</p>
               <p>4. He is to sink the pistoll into his bridle-hand, and to remove his right-hand towards the muzzle,
and their to rest the butt end vpon his thigh.</p>
               <p>5. He is to sink the pistoll into his bridle-hand, and takeing the key, or spanner into his right-hand,
puts it into the Axletree, and windes about the wheele till it stick, and so to returne the Spanner
to its place, being vsually fastned to the side of the case.</p>
               <p>6. Holding the pistoll in the bridle-hand (as before) he is to take his priming boxe into his right-hand,
and pressing the spring with his fore finger, puts poudre into the pann.</p>
               <p>7. He is to presse in the pan-pin with his right thumbe, &amp; so shuts the pan.</p>
               <p>8. VVith the bridle-hand he is to cast about his pistoll, and to hold it on his left side, with the muzzle
vpwards.</p>
               <p>9. VVith the right hand take forth your cartouch out of your pistoll case: for now flasks are growne
out of use amongst vs.</p>
               <p>10. Put your cartouch into the bore of your pistol.</p>
               <p>11. He is to draw his rammer out with his right-hand turned, and to hold it with the head downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>12. Holding the rammer head in his right hand (as before) he is to take the bullett out of his
mouth, or out of his bullett-bagg at the pistoll case, with the thumb and fore finger, &amp; putt it
into the muzzle of the pistoll, and the Rammer immediatly after it, &amp; then rammes it home.</p>

13. He is to drawe forth his Rammer with the right hand turned, and to returne it to its place.</p>
               <p>14 With the bridle-hand he is to bring the pistoll towards his right side, and placing the butt end
vpon his thigh, pulls downe the Cock.</p>
               <p>15 He is to take the Pistoll into his right hand, mounting the muzzle vpward.</p>
               <p>16. Having the Pistoll in his right-hand (as in posture 15) with his forefinger vpon the tricker, he is
to incline the muzzle (with a fixed eye) towards his mark, not suddenlie but by degrees (quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
or slower according to the space he rideth) and that not directly forward towards the horse
head, but towards the right, turning his right hand so as the lock of the pistoll maye be vpward,
and having gotten his marke he is to draw the tricker, and so give fire.</p>
               <p>17. He is to returne his pistoll into the Case, and then drawes out his other pistoll (as occasion maye
serve) and doeth as before, and thus much for the postures of the fire lock pistoll.</p>
               <p>Now concerming the <hi>Snap-hane</hi> pistoll, or <hi>Snap-hane Carabine</hi> (more vsual in England then in these
Countries) those postures, wherein they differ from the fire-lock pistoll are these following, which
beginn with the 18 Figure.</p>
               <p>18. Holding the pistoll in the bridle-hand as before hath bin shewed in Figure 14. with the right-hand
he is to bend the Cock.</p>
               <p>19. VVith the right hand he is to pull downe the back lock, and to secure the cock from going of.</p>
               <p>20. With the right hand he is to draw downe the hammer vpon the pan.</p>
               <p>21. With the right thumbe he is to thrust back the back-lock, and so to give the Cock libertie.
The 22. the 23. &amp; the 24. figures shew the marching postures of a Harquebussier or a Carabine.</p>

               <p>SEing that flasks are now growne out of use amonge our Horsemen, for the gaining of time, and the

Now the Cartouch is to be made of white paper, cutt out of a convenient breadth, and length,
and rowled vpon a stick (or the Rammer if it be not too litle) fit (according to the bore of the barrell)
to containe the due charge of powder and the bullett. The proportion of powder vsually required is
half the weight of the Bullett: but being strong &amp; fine pistoll powder, it is held too much in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of some men. Having moulded then the paper to fitt the <hi>Calibre,</hi> or boore of your pistoll (as is
said) the one end of it is to be turned in (to keepe in the powder) and the due charge of powder to be
putt into it at the other end, which powder is to be clossed in by tying a litle thred about the paper,
then the bullett is to be putt in, and that also to be tyed in with a litle thred, and when the <hi>Curassier,</hi> or
<hi>Harquebussier</hi> is to vse his Cartouch, he must bite of the paper at the head of it at the powder and, and
so putt it into the barrell of his pistoll with the bullet vpward, and then ramme it home for a readinesse
