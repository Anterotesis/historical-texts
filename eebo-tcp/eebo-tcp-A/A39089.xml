         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Royal Highneſs having been
graciouſly pleaſed to conſtitute
me Judge or Preſident of the
High Court of Admiralty, I
held it my duty (according to
my poor ability) to aſſert the juſt Juriſdiction
thereof, againſt thoſe undue encroachments and
uſurpations, whereby the power of the Lord
<pb facs="tcp:62625:3"/>
High Admiral hath been heretofore, and is at
this preſent ſtraightned, in deciſion of matters,
relating to Maritime affairs; wherefore having
ſome time ſince in thoſe ſad and diſtracted times,
beſtowed ſome labour in ſearching and peruſing
ſuch of the Records of our own, as well as For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Nations as I could meet with, wherein the
juſt extent of the Admirals Juriſdiction is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
and undeniably evidenced, together with
the neceſsity of deciding all controverſies about
Maritime affairs, according to the ancient Sea
cuſtomes, and the reaſon and directions of the
Civil and Maritime Laws. I held it no leſs my
duty to recollect the ſaid Papers, and reduce them
into ſome method for the clearing thoſe objections
which hitherto have been and ſtill are made uſe
of, either againſt the antiquity or extent of the
Lord High Admiral his Juriſdiction in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime
cauſes, or againſt the deciſion of them by
the ancient Sea cuſtomes, and the rules of the
Civil Law: And as I have obſerved this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hath happily flouriſhed a long time, under
that happy Government of all Land affairs by
its municipal Laws, practiced in the Common
Law Courts; ſo hath it no leſs proſpered and
been enriched in its Navies, Trade, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
<pb facs="tcp:62625:3"/>
under that exact Government which hath
ordered and guided all Maritime buſineſſes and
Sea affairs, by the Civil and Maritime Laws
and Cuſtomes (correſponding, agreeing, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
with the Laws of Forreign Nations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſuitable to the nature and negotiations of the
people that are ſubject to them) exerciſed and
practiſed in the High Court of Admiralty:
The deſign therefore that I propound to my ſelf
in the publiſhing this Treatiſe, is, to ſhew how
neceſſary and fitting it is, that the power and
juriſdiction of this Court ſhould be no longer ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to ſuch interruptions; and how expedient it
now is, that the rights and privileges of the
ſame ſhould be obſerved and kept, and the Laws
and ancient Cuſtomes thereof, whereby all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
and Navigation is upheld<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
and ſtrictly preſerved and maintained:
That all which may appear, I have ſet forth the
antiquity of the Lord Admirals Juriſdiction
here in <hi>England,</hi> by ancient Records of the
Tower: Next the Juriſdiction it ſelf, and the
extent thereof, as alſo the neceſsity and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
uſe of it in divers reſpects. In all which I
have endeavonred neither to eclipſe the honour,

<pb facs="tcp:62625:4"/>
this Kingdome, nor in any ſort to detract from
the renown of the Reverend and Learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
thereof, but hope I have manifeſted that
the upholding of both Juriſdictions, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining
each of them to its proper limits and
confines, will be more advantagious to this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and the Inhabitants thereof, then the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
eitber of them to ſwallow up or devour
the other. Be pleaſed therefore to receive this

               <p>Now amongſt thoſe that have been of opinion that the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Admiralty had its beginning in <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's
time,<note place="margin">Lambard Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheion tit. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral pag. 42.</note> I find Mr. <hi>Lambert</hi> to be one, who in his <hi>Archeion</hi> ſaith, that
he thinketh that the deciſion of maritime cauſes was not put out
of the Kings Houſe, and committed over unto the Admiral, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third; and his reaſon is, for that (as
he ſaith) he never heard mention of it before the ſecond year of
<hi>Richard</hi> the Second, who in his <hi>13th</hi> year made a Statute to reſtrain
the Admiralty from medling any further then it uſed to do in
the time of his Grandfather <hi>Edward</hi> the Third; where he heard
mention of it in the ſecond year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneth
not.</p>
               <p>But he muſt give me leave, (who by this Record laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
and by divers others have found mention made of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſuch time as he heard mention of it, and for divers other
reaſons) to believe this Court to be farre more ancient then he
thought it to be.</p>
               <p>For if this Record be well obſerved, it will plainly appear
that the Office of the Admiralty was an ancient Office at the
time of the Grant, which may eaſily be gathered out of theſe
words: <q>
                     <hi>Dantes ei plenam tenore praeſentium poteſtatem audiendi quere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las
omnium et ſingulorum de hiis quae officium Admiralli tangunt, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
and likewiſe out of theſe, <q>
                     <hi>et omnia alia quae ad officium Admiralli perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> from whence it appeareth that there was then a known
Office of the Admiral, not then lately inſtituted and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62625:10"/>
And it will more plainly appeare, if we look further back to
the Grants and Patents made unto others throughout this Kings
Reign, and other Kings Reigns before him, which being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
out of the Tower Records, will ſhew this Office and
Place to be of a farre greater antiquity: I ſhall therefore ſteer
my courſe by degrees backwards towards the confines of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
of this Juriſdiction, although hopeleſs to arrive there;
yet I ſhall go as farre by the antient Records as will ſerve for my
purpoſe.<note place="margin">Rot. an. 34 Ed. 3.</note>

               </p>
               <p>Sometimes they were called <hi>Capitanei &amp; Gubernatores Flotarum,
Navium,</hi> in regard of their employment, in ordering and ruling
of the Kings Fleet, employed either againſt an Enemy actively,
or for the defence of the Kingdome whenſoever diſturbed by an
Enemy; and for his power in gathering together of whatſoever
Ships he thought fitting for raiſing of Navies, or ſupply of the
defects of thoſe formerly raiſed, and the like.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they were called <hi>Custodes Maritimarum partium,</hi> for
that it was his office and duty to ſee all the maritime parts and
borders of the Sea ſufficiently provided of all things needfull
and neceſſary for the defence of the Nation againſt a forrain E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy;
and ſo likewiſe furniſhed with all manner of neceſſary
proviſions, for the entertainment of our own Ships, and Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
and reliefe of the Kings Friends which ſhould touch there
in diſtreſs, that his Subjects might receive the like upon the like
occaſion.</p>
               <p>Sometime <hi>Capitanei Nautarum &amp; marinellorum,</hi> for the power that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62625:12"/>
they had over all the ſea-faring men, in ordering them, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding
differences which ſhould fall out amongſt them, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and others with whom they dealt, or had to do:
And as a Captain and Commander ought not to ſuffer them to
wrong any, nor to be wronged by any.</p>
               <p>Sometimes <hi>Cuſtodes maris &amp; maritimarum partium,</hi> in regard they
were to ſee to the furniſhing of the Kings Ships at Sea, with
Men, Victuall, Tackle, Furniture and Ammunition; ſometimes
adding to the ſtrength of the Navy, by furniſhing out more
Ships from the Ports to the Sea, ready provided with neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
ſuch as they found fitting for that ſervice; and ſometimes
withdrawing, or (if preſent in the Navy) diſcharging others as
occaſion required. And as well to ſee to the ordering buſineſs
upon the ſea, as upon the Coaſts and Borders of the ſea.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they were ſtyled <hi>Cuſtodes marinae Regis,</hi> in reſpect
they had the keeping, ordering, ruling and diſpoſing of all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime
buſineſs, and Sea affairs, which belonged unto the King
himſelf, and concerned his Kingdomes generall good, or his
Subjects particular benefit, and quiet, either amongſt themſelves,
or with Forreigners.</p>
               <p>Which Title, as it was the firſt, I find born by the chief Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
for the ruling and ordering all Maritime affairs, within
ſuch limits as were aſſigned them by the King: ſo I conceive
it comprehends as much power as the title of Admiral; and
either of theſe as much as any of the reſt, and indeed as much as
all the reſt: And yet I conceive too, that any one of the reſt
intentionally, and as it was uſed, comprehended as much as
either of theſe: But I ſhall not here diſpute what the power,
authority, or juriſdiction of any of theſe Officers was (which
doubtleſs was the ſame) but ſhall deferre that to another head
more proper for the debate.</p>
               <p>I have here, ſo farre as my line would reach, and my ſmall
skill in records direct and guide me, followed the antiquity of
theſe higheſt Sea-officers, wherein, without doubt, I have in my
way miſt many things that might have been pertinent to that I
aime at: Yet have I (as I conceive) by records diſcovered a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
imployment of ſuch Officers, without any intermiſsion,
or ceſſation at all of that Office, even from the latter end of
King <hi>Edward</hi> the Thirds time, up to the eighth year of King
<hi>Henry</hi> the Third: and ſo I have hitherto argued the antiquity
of the Juriſdiction, from the antiquity of the Officer. What
this Juriſdiction anciently was, will hereafter be diſputed; in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:62625:13"/>
which diſpute the antiquity of the Admiralty will be further
diſcovered.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62625:15"/>
their Maritime cauſes, to judge them according to theſe Sea-laws
eſtabliſhed amongſt them, and duly to put them in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
               <p>Certainly theſe Laws were hatcht of order, and could not be
bred up to diſorder: Seamen ſurely had amongſt them a ſupreme
Governor, one or ſome that ſwayed and ruled the reſt in the
compoſure of them; and ſo muſt they neceſſarily have in the
diſpenſing of them, and adminiſtring juſtice according to
them.</p>
               <p>Now I hope it will not be ſaid that the maritime and ſeafa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
men contrived and made Laws amongſt themſelves, which
concerned themſelves, their Traffique, and Trade; and when
they had done, gave them over into the Land men hands (which
could not poſsibly underſtand the grounds and depth of them)
with a power to put them in execution, and ſo give others a
power over themſelves, which before had nothing to do with
them. If they would ſo have done (which no man will judge)
yet it is not to be believed, that in this Iſland of <hi>Rhodes</hi> they could,
which conſiſted generally of ſeafaring men.</p>
               <p>Who ſhould then be fit to be chiefeſt in managing theſe Laws,
but ſuch a one as had chiefly a hand, and was moſt dexterous
in making of them: ſo that I doubt not, but that we may bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſay and conclude, that as theſe Laws were compoſed, gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and collected by maritime and ſeafaring men, ſo were they
put in execution by the principal Governor and Ruler of them:
and ſo had they both birth and growth under the juriſdiction,
rule, and governance of the chief Captain, Commander and
Governor over all theſe ſeafaring men and ſhipping. And as
Cauſes encreaſed and multiplyed, ſo did the Laws, according
to the nature of the Cauſes; and as the Cauſes varied, ſo did
the Laws, untill they required the conſtant and continuall ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of ſuch as were to judge by them.</p>

tend very much to the preſervation of that Juriſdiction;
which work being not fully perfected, ſoon began to decay in
<hi>Edward</hi> the Second's time (whereby it may ſeem that that Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
never wanted Enemies) which withdrew its ſtrength,
and abated its power, untill the neceſſity thereof appearing in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:62625:18"/>
the decay of Navigation, and thereby of Trading and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce;
and of want of ſtrength in Shipping for the defence
of this Kingdome againſt forrain Forces and Enemies, ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
it, and reſtored unto it what had been withdrawn from
it, which was the cauſe (without doubt) that cauſed <hi>Edward</hi> the
Third to proceed in that good work, which his great Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had begun: <q>
                     <hi>Ad interpretandum, declarandum, &amp; conſervandum
leges &amp; ſtatuta per avi ſui anteceſſores</hi> Angliae <hi>Reges dudum ordinata,
&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> as the aforementioned Record ſets forth; after which, in his
time, it ſo revived and flouriſhed, that it might very well ſeem
a new birth, from whence ſome have conceived it to be the firſt
birth, and to have its beginning there, but upon no other ground
at all.</p>
               <p>I have hitherto only endeavoured the proof the Antiquity of
this Juriſdiction, which will more ſeaſonably follow when I ſhall
inforce the neceſſary uſe of the forementioned Laws, thoſe
which ſprang from the <hi>Rhodes,</hi> ſuppleated out of ſeveral other
titles in the body of the Civil Law; and thoſe which have been
derived from the antient Statutes of the Admiralty, the Laws
of <hi>Oleron, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which of theſe Laws were firſt introduced into this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
I ſhall not diſpute; this I ſhall only ſay, that they alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
make an exact and complete rule for the government of
all ſeafaring or ſea-trading men, and matters, and have been
here antiently and frequently uſed, and elſewhere, throughout
moſt parts of <hi>Europe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Divers others have been ſaid (ſince the making of the <hi>Rhodian</hi>
Laws) to have made new Sea Laws; as the Rulers of <hi>Rome</hi> in
<hi>1075th</hi> year; and ſince that <hi>Marſeilles, Genoa, Peloponneſus, Venice,
Conſtantinople, Conſtantine,</hi> and <hi>Barcellona</hi> in ſeveral years: But the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire having (not long before that time) been as it were
rent and torne in pieces, their Laws for the Land, and Land-affairs
laid aſide, and their Laws for the government of the Seas
quite ſubverted, and well nigh loſt, ſome of theſe Nations were
conſtrained to recollect and gather together ſuch parts and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
as could be well made up into one body again, with ſome
ſmall cement of our own, and might better be called a reparation
of their old Laws, then a ſtructure or edifice of new. For the reſt,
ſome ſay they are additional, ſome ſay explanatory to remove
falſe conſtructions and interpretations, and ſome ſay both: but
certainly for the moſt part they are but explanatory; for the
other Laws before mentioned, are accounted moſt authentick,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:62625:18"/>
and of chiefeſt authority throughout all, or the greateſt part of
<hi>Europe.</hi> But be theſe additional, yet the addition of Sea-laws to
Sea-laws is no diminution of Sea-Juriſdiction, but rather a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating
and perfecting thereof: but the compoſure of new land-Laws,
or if it be but the reformation of old, if thoſe Laws look
but toward the Sea, they oftentimes cauſe the diſcompoſure of
Sea-laws, and unleſs well lookt unto, the very deſtruction of that
Juriſdiction: but of that more will appear by what ſhall be
ſaid hereafter.</p>
               <p>And now before I proceed to any other argument for the
proof of the antiquity of this Juriſdiction, I ſhall give you one
reaſon only, which induceth me to believe, that the ſame was
ſettled long before the time before mentioned, and that the
<hi>Rhodian</hi> Sea-laws were here ſettled long before the Laws of <hi>Ole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
by <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt; and that is an Ordinance made by
<hi>Henry</hi> the firſt at <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> concerning the baniſhing a man for Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony
or Treſpaſs, which I find mentioned in an Article of the
antient Inquiry of maritime offences annexed unto the antient
Statutes of the Admiralty in the antient Parchment-leaved Book,
called the black Book of the Admiralty, where, after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

ſo antiently a Juriſdiction, I muſt neceſſarily inferre from thence,
that ſo antiently, if not ſomewhat before, the Laws of the Sea

there was an Admiral, for ſo there might have been, and he have

and <hi>maritimae partes,</hi> the Seas, the Coaſts and Ports of the

over all thoſe maritime parts, whereunto they were limited, and
over all Ships and Shipping, and over all things thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing,
and over all perſons whatſoever, who were therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd
within the ſaid limits, and had powet and authority of
hearing and determining of all differences and controverſies,
which did or might ariſe concerning the ſame, may be very well
concluded upon this further ground, that no other Court in
thoſe dayes preſumed ever to take cognizance of any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
or affairs, which I am confident of for the reaſons enſuing:
I hope no man will ſay that maritime cauſes were tried in the
<hi>Heal-gemote,</hi> now called the Court Baron; nor in the <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſmote,</hi>
now called the Hundred-Court, and is of the ſame
nature with the County-Court; nor yet in the <hi>Scyedgemote,</hi>
now called the<note n="b" place="margin">Lamb. Arch.</note> Sheriffs Turne, which were the Courts then
in uſe, and had been long before the Conqueſt, and do yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
and never did, nor do aſſume, nay not ſo much as chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
any right at all to any ſuch power.</p>
               <p>Nor did the Kings Court of Exchequer (which was the firſt
Court was ſettled after the Conqueſt) ever<note n="c" place="margin">Lamb. Arch.</note> undertake to deal
in cauſes of that nature; but (as Mr. <hi>Lambard</hi> determineth this
point very well) was only ſetled and appointed for cauſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Kings Demeaſnes and Receipts. And he ſaith that
after the Conqueror had ſuppreſſed the Forces of thoſe that made
head againſt him, here, he ſettled this Court for his Revenues,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62625:21"/>
and called it his Exchequer, after the name of his Exchequer in
<hi>Normandy;</hi> but (ſaith he) it differed not a little from that; for
the Exchequer of <hi>Normandy</hi> had not only the Government of the
Revenues of the Duke there, but was alſo the Soveraign Court
for the adminiſtration of Juſtice amongſt his Subjects until <hi>Lewis</hi>
the Twelfth, King of <hi>France, anno</hi> 1499. converted it into a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
conſiſting of a Preſident and Councellors, and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it at <hi>Roan</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> where it ſtill continueth. But (ſaith
he) this Exchequer in <hi>England</hi> had only the direction of his
Demeaſnes and Receipts, and the adminiſtration of Common
Juſtice continued ſtill in that high Court of Juſtice and Equity,
which did then and a long time after, as well as before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
follow the King himſelf; and for proof thereof he quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<hi>Gervaſius Tilburienſis,</hi> who wrote many obſervations upon the
Exchequer, which he dedicated to King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſecond, and
be yet remaining in the receipt under the cuſtody of the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berlains
of the Exchequer in the black book there.</p>
               <p>But becauſe (as Mr. <hi>Lambard</hi> ſaith) ſome contended to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that the Exchequer was in thoſe dayes a Court of all ſorts of

of their aſſertion, they do alledge the title of Mr. <hi>Glanvil</hi>'s Book

Common-Pleas were either of them ſettled <hi>in certo aliquo loco,</hi> that
the Exchequer might have the cognizance of all Cauſes between
party and party, as well maritime belonging to the Sea, and
Sea-affairs, and from thence ariſing; as terrene belonging to the
Land, and Land-affairs, and from thence growing; I ſhall here
ſet down Mr. <hi>Lambards</hi> anſwer to that which is alledged for the
proof, and maintenance of this aſſertion, who confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmeth,
that the aforementioned words are not the words of
<hi>Glanvil</hi> himſelf, but of the Publiſher of his Book in print, which
appeareth by what precedeth the words alledged in the Title,
<hi>viz. Tractatus de legibus de tempore Regis</hi> Henrici <hi>ſecundi compoſitus ab
illuſtri viro</hi> Ranulpho de Glanvile, <hi>juris regni, &amp; antiquarum conſuetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinum
eo tempore peritiſsimo;</hi> which (ſaith he) doth plainly ſhew
and bewray that the Publiſher ſpake of <hi>Glanvile</hi> as another man,
and which alſo lived not then, but at another time. And herein he
muſt needs ſay very truly, for never was there any Author of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
credit that ever gave himſelf this or the like title, or being li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:62625:21"/>
would ſay that he was <hi>juris regni &amp; antiquarum conſuetudinum

               </p>
               <p>And again, they have not taken in all the words of that title,
which do follow, but have left out theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>

which then followed the King, muſt needs be herein compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended

<hi>Tractatus de legibus de tempore</hi> Henrici <hi>ſecundi compoſitus ab illuſtri viro</hi>
Ranulpho de Glanvile, <hi>juris regni &amp; antiquarum conſuetudinum eo

quas placitatur in Curiâ Regis ad Scaccarium, &amp; coram Juſticiariis ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque

proof of their aſſertion. And ſo I ſhall leave the Exchequer then
only to govern and rule the Kings Revenues, Demeaſnes, and
Receipts, and ſuch matters as belong only thereunto; and next
caſt only a glance upon the Juſtices in Eyre and their Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>The Juſtices in Eyre are ſaid by <hi>Gervaſe</hi> of <hi>Tilbury</hi> to be <hi>quaſi
errantes,</hi> but by <hi>Bracton</hi> are called <hi>itinerantes:</hi> For King <hi>Henry</hi> the
Second in the <hi>32th</hi> year of his reign divided the Realm into ſix
parts, from which the Circuits which our Judges do now ride,
do not much differ; and to every of thoſe parts appointed three
Juſtices, who at their appointed times kept Circuits in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts to them limited, and held plea as well of Criminal
as of<note n="f" place="margin">Lamb. Arch. pag. 31, 32.</note> Civil Cauſes. But Juſtices of Aſſiſes being likewiſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed,
whoſe firſt office was to take Aſſiſes of <hi>Mort d'anceſter,</hi>
and <hi>Novel Deſſeiſins,</hi> according to the cuſtomes of <hi>Normandy,</hi>
where it is called <hi>la Novellette;</hi> and gaining a further power of
taking Attaints, Juries, and Certificates, and delivery of Gaols.
Theſe Juſtices of Aſsiſe by the beginning of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third's
Reign gave an end to the Juſtices in Eyre, who about that time
did ſurceaſe and take leave.</p>
               <p>Now could neither of theſe Juſtices, the Juſtices in Eyre not
coming every year into the Country, nor the other Juſtices (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſometimes at home, ſometimes in their Circuit; and in their
Circuit, ſometimes in one place, and ſometimes in another)
take<note n="g" place="margin">Lamb. Arch. pag. 35.</note> cognizance, or have the hearing and determining of
maritime cauſes, ſeafaring matters, or any thing them concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:
For ſuch cauſes did and do require a more ſpeedy diſpatch
and determination than theſe Juſtices could afford them. <hi>Nam</hi>

his cauſe is pleading for his right, his Ship is preparing for his

could the Court of Common-Pleas, when it was ſettled, take
cognizance of maritime cauſes, or ſeafaring matters, nor did the

that time been committed unto the care and charge of ſeveral
perſons, as appeareth by thoſe ſeveral Records of the ninth and

Court of Common-pleas ('tis plaine) began not to be ſettled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
the ninth year of the ſame King. if ſo ſoon; for it was but
that year determined that it ſhould be ſo ſettled; but the power
thereof reſted in the King himſelf, and his ſupreme Court, which
conſtantly followed him whitherſoever he removed; and was

               <p>Now although differences and controverſies of what nature

               </p>
               <p>I have likewiſe ſet forth the common and glad acceptance of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:62625:25"/>
them, or of what could be got of them; or rather the earneſt
ſuit for them by very many other Nations, the uſe whereof hath
been moſt profitably continued amongſt them.</p>
               <p>Can it be thought then that this Nation being an Iſland (to
which Shipping and Navigation muſt needs be moſt neceſſary
and uſefull) ſhould deny or refuſe theſe Laws, ſo ſerviceable and
uſefull for their Maritime affairs, there being no other Law
here uſefull for that purpoſe? or ſhall it be thought that this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
neither knew or heard of them, when ſo many other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
did?</p>
               <p>Certainly no: This Nation hath very antiently flouriſhed by its
Trade and Traffique with other Nations, and hath been frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
accuſtomed to Navigation, and Transfretation, and hath had
as well converſe as commerce with thoſe Nations, and would as
well convey thoſe Laws hither for their common Government,
as tranſport their own Commodities thither for their private be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
which happily could not be enjoyed, one without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
If not ſo, yet let no man ſay that the two famous antient
Univerſities of the Land, wherein there be ſo many Colleges,
and houſes of antient foundation, in which have been by the
Founders themſelves, ſo many Fellow-Ships, Scholar-ſhips, and
places founded, ſettled, and employed properly and ſolely for
Students in the Civil and Maritime Laws, or the Laws proper
and neceſſarily uſefull for Navigation and Maritime affairs, being
ſo ſcattered, (or I will rather ſay decently, as flowers ſtrewed)
and diſperſt through the whole body of the Civil Law, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
whereon thoſe Students were to ſpend their daily labour,
pains, and employment, could poſsibly be long ignorant of thoſe
Laws, that theſe ſo many forenamed nations had ſo long and ſo
well known?</p>
               <p>What if known by this Nation, was there yet any uſe made
of them in it? That they were known by what hath been ſaid or
conſidered, cetainly I cannot have ſo ill a conceipt of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
men, the antient Inhabitants of this Nation, as to think them
ſo long ignorant and unskilfull of thoſe antient Laws of the Sea,
and Laws ſo neceſſary for maritime affairs, as ſome would make
them to be; much leſs will I think the Government of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be without ſo good order and juſtice in any particular,
as not to ſettle theſe Laws once known for the government of
its maritime matters; nor will I imagine the maritime men to
be ſo dull or ſtupid, as not gladly to embrace the ſettlement of
ſuch Laws as tended ſo much to their quiet, and advance of their
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:62625:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
profit, being to trade and commerce with ſuch as uſed, in this
particular, no other Laws but theſe.</p>
               <p>Again, ſhall we ſay that ſo many Nations, ſome ſo remote,
and ſome ſo near home as <hi>France,</hi> but over againſt us, and <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
even within the ſame Iſland, all governed by the Civil Laws,
or Municipal Laws thence derived, and by them regulated and
guided as the Sea Laws are, and keep the pathes and very foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps
thereof in their proceedings, as the Sea Laws do; have with
ſo much eagerneſs purſued and ſought for theſe Sea Laws, and
with ſo much chearfulneſs embraced, and continued them; and
that this Nation that is inveſted in a Law particular and muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal,
which doth in no wiſe ſo much as challenge or claim any
derivation from, or dependency of the Civil Law, but is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
different and diſagreeable thereunto in its proceedings, and
oftentimes in its determinations, and hath no foundation or
grounds whereon the diciſions of ſea-controverſies can be built,
ſhould without the knowledge and practiſe of theſe Civil and
Maritime Laws, deal and trade with ſuch as do live under them,
and are guided by them? ſurely no, ſo many inconveniences, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions
&amp; diſtempers by reaſon of the variouſneſs of two Laws,
both in proceedings, &amp; oftentimes in determinations, would long
agone have deſtroyed all our Commerce and Traffique with theſe
other Nations, and ſo conſequently have diſpoiled us of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation
and Shipping, the principal ſafeguard of this Land.</p>
               <p>Nay, I am ſo farre from doubting the acceptance of theſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime
and Sea Laws, here in <hi>England,</hi> as well as in other Nations,
that I am confident they were here ſettled before they were ſettled
in divers of thoſe Nations before mentioned: For I muſt not

that thoſe Articles of <hi>Scotland</hi> were borrowed from ſome of the

French Record, by <hi>Roughton,</hi> and in an antient Character in the

Articles.</p>
               <p>The third is the Inquiſition taken at <hi>Quinborough,</hi> the 2. of <hi>April</hi>
in the <hi>49th</hi> year of the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third; at which time,
and to which place he cauſed ſeveral maritime and ſeafaring and
ſea-trading men of the beſt judgement and knowledge in ſea-affairs
of moſt of the maritime parts of <hi>England</hi> to be ſummoned,
and there before <hi>W. Nevel</hi> Admiral of the <hi>North, Philip Courtney</hi>
then Admiral of the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and <hi>William</hi> Lord <hi>Latimer</hi> Chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain
of <hi>England,</hi> and Warden of the <hi>Cinque-Ports,</hi> to meet together,
and conſider of all ſuch points and matters as had antiently and
uſually been obſervable, inquirable, and puniſhable in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty,
upon which inquiſition 81 Articles were concluded on,
which are likewiſe ingroſſed (they being more particular than
the former) in old French, in the ſaid antient black Book of the
Admiralty: But theſe (as the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Articles) do concern only
matters to be proceeded againſt criminally, and not matters of
Trade, Traffique and Commerce, and damages ſuſteined at Sea,
or in Ports, havens, &amp;c. whereof I ſhall come to treat in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Book; yet do theſe ſeveral Records in ſeveral Articles ſet
forth in what manner ſuch as ſhall ſue or implead any Merchant,
Mariner, or ſeafaring man for any Contract maritime, whether
made by Charter-party or otherwiſe, or for any thing whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
done of, or concerning any Ship or other Veſſel in any other
Court then the Admiral, ſhall be proceeded againſt, as I ſhall
more particularly hereafter ſet forth: But my chiefeſt reaſon that
the Civil and Maritime Law-Courts were here ſettled in <hi>England;</hi>
before they were ſettled in divers of thoſe other Nations, is for
that this Nation hath had the Dominion over the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas,
and their High-Admirals their Juriſdiction over thoſe Maritime
Affairs, which fell <hi>ſub iſto regimine &amp; dominio,</hi> ſo antiently, as that
in <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſts time the ſame was acknowledged by very
many other Nations to have been then beyond the memory of
man, as I have before ſet forth in the<note n="a" place="margin">Sup. cap. 5</note> 
                  <hi>5th</hi> chapter of this Book,
where I take my authority from an antient Record of the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
in nature of a Libel, intituled <hi>De ſuperioritate maris Angliae, &amp;
jure officii Admiralitatis in eodem;</hi> as is in the ſame <hi>5th</hi> chapter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt.
The Record it ſelf I was a long time ſince ſhewed by my
old friend Mr. <hi>Collet,</hi> who for a long time had the keeping of the
Tower Records under ſeveral men, unto whoſe care and cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
the ſame were committed; and afterwards I met with the
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62625:27"/>
ſame in Mr. <hi>Seldens</hi> Book,<note n="b" place="margin">Seld de dom. maris. li. 2. c. 26.</note> 
                  <hi>De Dominio maris,</hi> which I had not
before read over; and after that I found the ſame ſet forth by
<note n="c" place="margin">Coke Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic. Court. c. 22.</note> Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> in his Juriſdictions of Courts; yet I will not
ſend the Reader thither to ſeek it, but for his readier peruſal I
ſhall again ſet forth the ſame here, and therewith terminate and
end this firſt Book of my Maritime Dicaeologie of <hi>England.</hi> The
words of the Record are theſe.</p>

ſettlement of the Juriſdiction of the Admiralty
Court here in <hi>England</hi> be not by me in the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
book ſo clearly ſet forth as ſome might have
expected, yet is ſome foundation thereof deduced
from ſuch hight of Antiquity, as that I cannot
but hope that the Juriſdiction it ſelf will for that cauſe, and
what ſhall be ſhewed in this enſuing Treatiſe, deſerve a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to poſterity. And although in the precited antient Records,
we find not the ſame title of that Office obſerved, and kept, yet
may we very well perceive the ſame Office to have been preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
exerciſed, and executed, though under ſeveral titles. And
we find that in <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt's time (as plainly appears by the
before quoted<note n="a" place="margin">Cap. ult. prim. lib.</note> Libel, and other before cited Records) the
ſame was exerciſed under the title of <hi>the Admiral:</hi> And doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
that title was long before that time known to belong unto
the chief Captain, Commander, or Keeper of the Fleets, Ports,
and Seas, and hath been ſo uſed by many other Nations in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:62625:29"/>
However the diverſity of names neither extinguiſheth the
nature of the Office, nor doth ſo much as make any diſtinction
between the one and the other perſon ſo diverſly named, whilſt
they both bear one and the ſame ſignification.</p>
               <p>But here I ſhall proceed next to diſtinguiſh this Juriſdiction
from the Land Juriſdiction, and ſhew that the Land Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and Sea Juriſdiction are (and muſt neceſſarily ſo be) two ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute,
different and diſtinct Juriſdictions, having no dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
one upon the other.</p>
               <p>And firſt theſe two Juriſdictions are abſolutely different and
diſtinct in reſpect of the parties which exerciſe them; the one
being exerciſed in the active and directive part by the Admirals,
Captains, and Governors of the Seas, Sea-coaſts, Ports, and Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping,
which have all or moſt of them from antient times been
<hi>Equites Aurati,</hi> deſcended from Royal Bloud: Noble-men, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended

the Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and within the Bodies of the ſeveral
Counties of the Nation in their ſeveral Circuits; the Judges of
one Circuit having no authority or power over the other, nor
having any thing to do to intermeddle with the other in their
Circuits.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Court of the Admiralty hath from antient times
been ſtyled <hi>Suprema Curia ſuae Majeſtatis Admiralitatis</hi> Angliae; ſo
that the ſame hath antiently been ſtyled the Kings Court, as well
as his Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> But from the one Juriſdiction there
lyeth an immediate appeal unto the ſupreme authority in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,
which Court appointeth Judges Delegates by Commiſsion
under the Great Seal (upon the apprehenſion of an illegal ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence)
who are aſsigned and appointed Judges for further hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
deciding, and adjudging of the ſaid ſentence and cauſe of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,
according to the rules of the Civil Law.</p>
               <p>In the other there lies a Writ of Error from the Common-Pleas
to the Kings-Bench, and from that Bench to the Judges
of all the three Benches in the Exchequer Chamber.</p>
               <p>The Appeal from the Admiralty is for the rectifying of the
Sentence, as well as of the proceedings, which appeal the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigner
muſt be allowed, otherwiſe he will complain at home
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62625:29"/>
of injuſtice done here, and ſo proceed to the courſe of obtaining
Letters of Repriſal for his ſatisfaction, whether the firſt ſentenc
was good or not, upon this ground only, that he had not the due
courſe of Law allowed him, for the tryal of that Sentence which
was firſt given againſt him.</p>
               <p>The Writ of Error reverſeth the Judgement, though never
ſo juſt, if an error be found in the proceedings; but reverſeth
not the Judgement, though the ſame ſeem never ſo erroneous
to him againſt whom it was given, if no error be found in the
proceedings.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they are abſolutely different and diſtinct in regard
of the different and diſtinct ſubjects the Judges of them do han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
and are buſied about; they of the one being buſied and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
in the ordering and diſpoſing of all buſineſſes upon the
Coaſts and Havens of the Seas, tending to the preſervation of
this Nation from forraign Invaſion, and keeping thereof in ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and quiet; and in the building, repairing, tackling, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing,
or cauſing the building, repairing, tackling, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing
of all manner or ſorts of Ships, Boats, or Veſſels what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
for that purpoſe, and keeping the dominion over the
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Seas, and in the otherwiſe ordering and directing of all
manner of Ships, and Shipping, and ſeafaring Men, and all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of Trading, Merchandiſing, Traffique, and Commerce there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
or therewith: and in hearing, deciding, and adjudging all
differences, debates and controverſies ariſing from things done,
or to be done at Sea, or in any Port, Harbour, or Creek thereof,
either between the King or the Lord High-Admiral, and any
party, or between party and party, Forraigner or others, whether
Criminal or Civil.</p>
               <p>Thoſe of the other Juriſdiction being employed in ordering
of all things for the good peace and quiet of this Kingdome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
ſelf, and in the hearing and determining of all offences, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates
and differences ariſing, or growing from any thing done,
or to be done within the ſeveral bodies of the Counties thereof,
whether they be Criminal or Civil, whether they concern Eſtates
real or perſonal; whether they be between the King, and any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
party, or between party and party, which are tryable by the
ſaid Law.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they are different and diſtinct, in reſpect of the rules
the Judges proceed unto judgement by, thoſe of the one Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
proceeding according to the rules of the Civil Law, known
and uſed by all or moſt Courts and Judicatures in Chriſtendome.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:62625:30"/>
Thoſe of the other proceeding according to Rules and Laws
municipal, known only unto themſelves, and ſuch as are well
skilled and verſt in the ſame, and are Inhabitants and Subjects
of this Nation.</p>
               <p>To ſet forth the differences between theſe two Juriſdictions
in their proceedings, was to undertake the ſetting down of the
whole proceedings in all ſeveral cauſes, tryable both in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty,
and the Common-Law Courts; the one of which (with
ſome pains) I might very wel do; but the other belongs not to
me to undertake: yet ſo much I know of them, as that I am
ſufficiently informed in my judgement, that they are exceednig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
different even in their proceedings.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, they are different even in the Laws themſelves, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the Judges are guided to their determination, and directed in
their giving of judgement; thoſe of the one Juriſdiction deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
according to thoſe Civil Laws, which are Maritime, and
ſtill retained, and kept in uſe in moſt Nations in <hi>Europe,</hi> adjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereunto thoſe few and ſhort Laws of <hi>Oleron,</hi> with ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
cuſtomary Laws of the Seas, which are commonly accepted
and known, where ſuch Judicatories are kept and held; and are
expreſly declared and publiſhed by ſeveral Maritime Writers.
Thoſe of the other judging according to a municipal Law, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
prepared, and compoſed only for Land affairs, and indeed
only for the Land affairs of this Kingdome by the advice of ſuch
as have had the beſt judgement in thoſe Land affairs.</p>
               <p>And as theſe are different and diſtinct from the Civil and
Maritime Laws, which have been compoſed by the advice of
ſuch as have had frequent Traffique, Trade, and Commerce at
ſea, and by that means have had beſt knowledge and judgement
in ſea affairs: So indeed in the ſame manner are the Civil Laws
which have been compoſed and eſtabliſhed in other Nations by
ſuch as have been of beſt experience in buſineſſes of the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique,
for the guiding and governance thereof diſtinguiſhed and
kept apart from thoſe other Civil Laws which are Maritime.<note place="margin">Infra li iſto 2. cap. 14. &amp; 15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The abſolute neceſſity of keeping theſe two Juriſdictions thus
diſtinct one from the other, you ſhall have fully ſet forth in the
14. and 15. chapters of this ſecond Book, wherein is ſhewed the
uſe and practice of the Civil Law in moſt forraign Nations,
and that the ſame is abſolutely neceſſary to be uſed and practiſed
in all Admiralty Courts, unto which two chapters I eſpecially
referre the Reader.</p>

from the Land Juriſdiction; in the next place the bounds

               <p>Firſt then, that this Juriſdiction extendeth to all manner of
Ships and Shipping, (I conceive) will not be denyed; for it is
plain by the Records already quoted, that the Kings had in thoſe
antient times their Admirals as well for the Northern Seas and
Coaſts as the Weſtern; yea, and ſometimes ſeveral Admirals for
one of theſe Coaſts, as in the twentieth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond,

of theſe Coaſts, and in every of theſe particular places within
theſe Coaſts (where he had <hi>Capitaneum &amp; Admirallum flotae ſuae</hi>) a

                  <hi>And in that of the firſt of</hi> Edward <hi>the Third, in theſe words,</hi>

               <p>So that theſe who were Admirals of the Kings Fleet, were Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals

               <p>And as it extendeth to all manner of Shipping, ſo doth it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
unto all manner of Shipmen: for to little purpoſe was it
for the Admiral to have had power and authority over the wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Veſſels, if they had not had power over all the Seamen and
Mariners in them, yea, and over all others that belonged there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
or had to do therewith, or were skilled therein. For by

                     </gap>es alii de flotâ,</hi> over whom the Admirals had command, power,
and authority, beſides the Mariner; as is ſet forth in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Records. And as it had been to little purpoſe for the
Admiral to have had power over the Veſſels, and not over the
Mariners and Seamen, and others fit for that imployment; ſo
had it been to as little purpoſe, if he had not had the ſame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
over the Owners of them, and the Merchants that employed
them, who otherwiſe would have either oppoſed his directing
the uſe of them, or his own uſing of them at all, though for the
ſervice of the King, and good of the Common wealth. And to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62625:31"/>
as little purpoſe had this extent of his Juriſdiction been, had he
not had the command over all ſuch as were moſt able and skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to fit and furniſh them for ſervice.</p>
               <p>And the conſtituting of a man <hi>Capitaneum &amp; Admirallum Flotae
navium, Capitaneum navigii, Cuſtodem marinae, Capitaneum nautarum &amp;
marinellorum, &amp;c.</hi> doth give a very great power not particularly
ſpecified in the Grant.</p>
               <p>For all men very well know, that all Patents and Grants, as
well of Offices and Places, as of Lands and other things, did in
antient times comprehend and contain in them very much, in a
very few lines and words; and have been daily enlarged by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
expreſſions, and ſingular ſpecifications, when as nothing
more hath been granted, then what was by general words gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
before: And the reaſon hath been, leſt ſome particulars in
proceſs of time might be loſt for want of continual uſe, or
drawn into queſtion, and cavilled againſt, whether uſed or not
uſed.</p>
               <p>Yet have I ſeldome met with any of theſe ſpecifical Grants
that do truſt to ſuch ſpecification, without the general addition,
<hi>&amp; omnia alia pertinentia,</hi> or the like, leſt in their particular ſpecifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
they ſhould loſe ſomewhat of that which was formerly
granted in general words, and by ſome perhaps obſerved, and
known to be appertinent, and belonging unto the thing granted,
though for ſome time diſcontinued.</p>
               <p>We muſt not think therefore that by ſpecifying particulars, and
ſtretching a conveyance of half a dozen lines into whole a skin
of Parchment or more, one foot of land is gained the more there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by:
for if ſo, I might very well conceive, that the ſeller often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
might by that means ſell more then his own. For I have
often ſeen many more particulars ſpecified in the Conveyance
from the ſeller, then were ever intended by the Conveyance to
paſs to the buyer, or the ſeller had to ſell. And indeed this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging
of Conveyances and Grants is ſo uſuall, that a man
might very well conceive (the Evidences being peruſed from the
firſt to the laſt) that every alienation had begot an enlargement
of the eſtate, when nothing at all hath been added thereto.</p>
               <p>We muſt not think therefore, that becauſe there have been
more particulars of the Admirals power and juriſdiction ſpecified
in the latter Grants, and Patents, then were in the former and
more antient; that therefore theſe latter Admirals have gained
greater and larger power and juriſdiction then the former had.</p>
               <p>Nor certaily can any thing be gained by ſpecifying particulars;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62625:32"/>
ſomething may be ſaved, and ſomewhat may be very well loſt, if
<hi>&amp; omnia alia</hi> ſave it not.</p>
               <p>I will not deny but that there may be, and deyly are made unto
Manors, Lands, and Tenements, many additions, whereby they
are much encreaſed.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe to offices and other places, both in extent of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and increaſe of fees, or other profits: But theſe additions
do, and alwayes will appear by the Deeds of Conveyance, Grants
or Patents themſelves, and are diſtinguiſhed from the antient Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors,
&amp;c. and their appurtenances; and from the antient offices
and places, their rights and profits, by <hi>Et praeterea,</hi> or <hi>ac etiam,</hi> or <hi>ac
ſimiliter, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And where there is an addition, theſe words or the like always
are; but always where theſe words are, there is not always an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
for they are ſometimes uſed by way of ſpecification; and
ſometimes inſtead of an <hi>et,</hi> between two ſpecifications.</p>
               <p>Now in antient times, the very conſtituting an Admiral, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
or Governour of the Fleet or Navage, carried with it all the
power and juriſdiction belonging unto that office or place, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſpecifying any of the particulars; and when any particular
deſigne was in hand at the time of the conſtituting and making
of the Captain or Admiral, or whatſoever other title he bore (as
often ſuch deſigne at that time there was, which cauſed the change
of the Admiral) then was that particular power which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto his office, and concerned that deſigne, ſpecified either in
the Mandate directed to all Sheriffs, and other Miniſters and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
for their obedience unto him, as Admiral, Captain, &amp;c.
but in ſuch manner as ſheweth that particular to be included a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the many other particulars granted unto him by his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
under the general words, <hi>Conſtituimus dilectum &amp; fidelem</hi> N.
<hi>Capitaneum &amp; Admirallum flotae navium,</hi> or <hi>Capitaneum Navigii, &amp;c.</hi>
or elſe that particular, when any is ſpecified in the body of the

plainly ſheweth that that ſame particular was before amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
granted in the preceding general words. I ſhall here ſet down

Then it is declaratorie, and ſpecifieth ſome particulars of his

the Grant, which being not often uſed or put in execution, might
cauſe ſome to doubt whether ever they have been uſed at all or not;
and ſo to queſtion whether ſuch particulars were comprehended
in the Grant by thoſe general words or not, being things of ſo
great and high authority and power: Therefore are theſe words
<hi>ita quòd</hi> inſerted, which do not import the conceſsion of any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
power or authority then what was granted before: but in
all manner of reading they intimate that by the conſequent words

property, or quality, which is comprehended under the precedent
words.</p>
               <p>It reſts then that theſe ſpecifical words inſerted in this Patent,
are only declaratory, that ſuch power and authority doth belong
unto that great Officer and Governor of the Seas, by virtue of
ſuch his Office: for though firſt the imployment begets the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer,
and ſo conſequently the Office; yet when it is become an
Office, the very conſtituting of the Officer, and granting of that
Office, is the granting of all the imployment that hath belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereunto.</p>
               <p>Theſe laſt cited Records do manifeſt the great power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
which the great Officers of the Seas had, and hath over all

Bailiffs, and other miniſterial Officers, who were and are to be
attendant, aiding, aſsiſting, and obedient unto his and his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
Commands, in the execution of the Office, of ſo great

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <head type="sub">That the Ports and Havens, and Creeks of the Sea, are
within the juriſdiction of the Admiralty.</head>
               <p>IT is affirmed by ſome, whereof that moſt famous Lawyer
Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> is one, that the Ports, Creeks, and Havens
of the Sea, are within the bodies of the Counties, and are not
within the Juriſdiction of the Admiralty. His bare aſſertion in
his own learning may (I confeſſe) very well paſs for authority;
but in the deciſion of this matter, between that Juriſdiction he
himſelf exerciſed according to the municipal Laws of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and whereof he himſelf was a Profeſſor, and a Judge; and
that other Juriſdiction exerciſed by a Profeſſor of another Law
ſo diſtinct and different from his, <hi>viz</hi> the Civil and Maritime
Laws; he hath in my judgement, ſhewn himſelf extremely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
and much different in opinion from ſome others which ſate
in his place before him, as I ſhall plainly ſhew hereafter: And
I muſt confeſs it ſounds very ſtrangely in my ears, to hear that
which hath ever ſince the Sea was called the Sea, been called an
arme of the Sea, now called an arme of the Land, or an arme of
a County, or the part of the body of a County; much leſs then
will it ſink into my underſtanding how it comes to be in the
body or heart of a County, when for the moſt part it ſeparateth
one County from another. But it hath been an antient aſſertion
and obſervation, that where any land or ground is gained from
the ſea in one part, or on one ſide thereof, the ſea doth gain as
much upon the land in ſome other part, or on the other ſide
thereof: And ſo it ſeems the ſea hath gained upon the land of
all or moſt other Nations on the other ſide, and beyond the ſeas,
inſomuch that their Admiralties ſwell, and the ſweetneſs of that
gain and profit they reap by Sea-trade and Commerce with other
Nations, hath cauſed them to add daily new priviledges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
rather then to diminiſh or take away any of the old. And
<hi>England</hi> inſtead of what the ſea hath gained upon the land of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nations, hath gained upon the ſea; and being leſs conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
or carefull of the commodity and gain the Sea-trade and
Traffique bringeth it in, had once well-nigh quite deſtroyed that
antient Juriſdiction, which is not yet quiet, but continually
ſpurned and kickt at: for put all that together which Sir <hi>Edward
Coke</hi> would prove, and ſome that have followed him would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:62625:34"/>
and they would leave the Admiralty very liitle or no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
at all, and but little more then a bare and naked title,
as ſhall hereafter be ſhewed.</p>
               <p>And it would have ſounded as ſtrangely to me to have heard
of ſhips lying and riding at Anchor within the body of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but that I have heretofore often heard of their often riding
and lying at Anchor in <hi>Parochiâ Sanctae</hi> Mariae <hi>de</hi> Bow <hi>in Wardâ de</hi>
Cheap.</p>
               <p>The Arguments that are by him uſed for the proof of this
particular, that the Ports and Havens are within the bodies of
Counties, are confounded with thoſe whereby he endeavoureth
to prove the Admiralty to have no Juriſdiction within thoſe
Ports, Havens and Creeks; and what is uſed for the proof of the
one, is uſed for the proof the other, and will come to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
altogether. Yet when he hath uſed all his arguments to
prove theſe his aſſertions, out of his ingenuity confeſſeth the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity
of this Juriſdiction to be fetched from far more antient
times, then the reign of<note n="a" place="margin">Coke Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. of Courts; cap. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, in whoſe dayes (as
ſaith) ſome have dreamed it began. And for proof hereof he ſets
down word for word (as he ſaith) the Libel, (which I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
quoted out of the Tower Roll, and is likewiſe quoted by
Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>) of <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſts time.</p>
               <p>And after that,<note n="b" place="margin">Idem. Ibid.</note> to ſhew that of antient times there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Admirals, for that (as he affirmeth) the wiſdome of thoſe
dayes would not truſt one man with ſo great a charge, nor any
man to have a certain eſtate in an Office of ſo great truſt, he ſets
forth ſeveral of thoſe Records which I have cited before out of
the Tower Rolls, for proof of the antiquity of that Juriſdiction,
none of them ſerving at all to his former purpoſe, but ſome of
them may very well ſerve againſt it; as that of the <hi>15th</hi> year of
<hi>Henry</hi> the Third; which he ſetteth forth thus.</p>

               </p>
               <p>So that he reckoneth this man amongſt the Admirals, (as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
he could do no leſs, he having that office and place) and
he doth acknowledge, that by his Patent he had, <hi>cuſtodiam omnium
portuum &amp; totius coſterae marinae.</hi> Now to have <hi>cuſtodiam portuum,</hi> and
to have no Juriſdiction or power in <hi>portibus,</hi> can in no mans
judgement ſeem leſs then a plain contradiction.</p>
               <p>And in like manner he quoteth another of the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi>
the Firſt to the very ſame purpoſe, which runneth thus.</p>

Take this conſtruction firſt, and read them in this ſence, <hi>Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitur

Admirallus tam quinque portuum quàm aliorum portuum, &amp; Capitaneus &amp;

Captain and Admiral of all other places by the Sea-coaſts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Weſtern parts.</p>
               <p>And the firſt two Records of theſe four by him cited for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordancy
and agreement ſake, do warrant this conſtruction;
and that the ſame may be made of the words, as without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity

the truth thereof: And then are theſe two laſt a confirmation of
the two firſt, and argue the ſame thing, beſides what elſe may
be gathered out of them, againſt the truth of that aſſertion. For
certainly he that had <hi>Cuſtodiam portuum,</hi> and was <hi>Cuſtos Regis por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum,</hi>

               <p>The Admiral therefore muſt have juriſdiction and power up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Creeks, Ports and Havens, or elſe his power at ſea will
come to little or nothing. I ſhall give you here but one inſtance
which will ſhew the neceſſity of his having juriſdiction upon the
Ports and Havens as well as upon the high ſeas.</p>
               <p>If one Ship ſhall do damage to another either upon the main
Sea, or upon any Creek, Port, or Haven, the damages muſt be ſued
for in the Admiralty Court, and judgement given according to the
Maritime Laws, which preſcribe every Ship her rule, how to
ſteer her courſe, both going out to Sea, or coming home from
Sea, or riding at Sea; which plainly demonſtrateth which Ship
was in fault, by which the Judgement muſt be regulated, for
which the Common Law hath no rules at all, nor can any action
properly by the rules thereof be commenced at that Law for theſe
damages: For that the Owners damnified can very hardly arreſt
all the Owners of the other Ship which did the damage: nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
can any of thoſe Owners by that Law, as I have been by
ſome of the learned of that profeſsion informed, be lyable to ſuch
arreſt, but the Maſter only; who, if ſolvent, will not come on
ſhore, but take his imployment in ſome other Ship outward
bound; if not ſolvent, the arreſt will be to little purpoſe: ſo that
the remedy lyeth only againſt the Ship by the Civil and Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
Laws, according to the courſe thereof, which proceedeth
in caſes of this nature by way of ſeveral defaults, &amp;c. which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
will bring in the Owners to anſwer the Action, or make the
Ship lyable to make ſatisfaction for the damage done, in ſo much
as ſhe is worth; which courſe of proceedings the Common Law
hath not.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Arguments deduced out of the Statute Law, to prove
the Ports, Havens, and Creeks of the Sea, to be within
the bodies of Counties, and not within the Juriſdiction of
the Admiralty, redargued.</head>
               <p>HAd this been but a bare aſſertion, that the Ports, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
and Creeks of the Sea are within the bodies of
Counties, and not within the Juriſdiction of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty,
more needed not (I conceive) have been ſaid then what
hath been already ſaid, in the former chapter: But the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
that are uſed for proof thereof, will neceſſarily require a
farre larger diſcourſe for anſwer thereunto, and further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the contrary. For here I am to encounter a great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt,
the forementioned Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> ſometime Lord chief
Juſtice of the Kings Bench, a man moſt famous for his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and pains in the Laws of this Nation, whoſe memory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
is ſtill not undeſervedly honoured: yet though my
encounter be upon this diſadvantage, I doubt not but to give ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
to a Judge indifferent between both Juriſdictions and
Profeſsions, as well in this point, as in ſome other things by
him aſſerted.</p>
               <p>For the proof of this point, he firſt aſſerteth the Statute of the
fifth of<note n="a" place="margin">Eliz. 5. c. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Elizabeth, cap.</hi> 5. which (ſaith he) deſcribeth parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
the limits of the Lord Admirals Juriſdiction, in theſe
words: All and every ſuch of the ſaid offences before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as hereafter ſhall be done on the main Sea, or coaſts of the
Sea, being no part of the body of any County of this Nation,
and without the Precinct, Juriſdiction and Liberty of the Cinque-ports,
or without any Haven, or Pear, ſhall be tryed and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
before the Lord Admiral, &amp;c. So as (ſaith he) by the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the whole Parliament, the Juriſdiction of the Lord Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
is wholly confined to the main Sea, or Coaſts of the Sea,
being no parcel of the body of any County of this Nation.</p>
               <p>In anſwer hereunto, I do deny that theſe words in this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
do preſcribe particularly the limits of the Lord Admirals Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction,
if he mean his whole Juriſdiction in general: but I
will confeſs they do preſcribe him certain limits, <hi>quoad</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
of his Juriſdiction, by making the particular acts before
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:62625:38"/>
mentioned in the Statute, to be offences, and puniſhable, and
do declare that his, and the Warden of the Cinque-ports Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
upon the main Sea, ſhall be increaſed, by having granted
unto them the cognizance of ſuch of the before mentioned of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences,
as ſhould be committed thereupon, and do reſtrain his
Juriſdiction within the Ports and Havens to what formerly it
had, without having any increaſe thereof by the Cognizance of
ſuch the before mentioned offences, as ſhould be committed
thereupon; and this appeareth plainly out of the words by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
recited, <hi>viz.</hi> All and every ſuch of the ſaid offences before
mentioned ſhall be triable thus and thus, not having any relation
unto any offences, or cauſes triable, either before the Admiral, or
cognoſcible by any other Judge.</p>
               <p>And indeed if we look backward to thoſe offences before
mentioned in the Statute, which can be committed in or about
the Havens or Ports, we ſhall find that they are not of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of ſuch Civil and Maritime cauſes, or offences, as are ſubject
unto that Juriſdiction of the Admiralty. The particulars are
theſe.</p>
               <p>1. That any Subject may carry Sea-fiſh forth of the Realm in
any of the Queens Subjects Ships, without paying Cuſtome.</p>
               <p>Now we know very well that the paying of Cuſtome in every
Port Town belongeth to a peculiar Office for that purpoſe, and
the Admiral neither doth, nor did for many years meddle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with.</p>
               <p>2. That no perſon in any Port, City, Town, Market, or other
place, ſhall ſet price, make reſtraint, take or demand Toll, or Tax
of any Sea-fiſh to be brought into this Nation, being taken and
brought in in Subjects Ships.</p>
               <p>Here Port is taken for the Port-town, or Haven-town: for
the priſing, taxing, and tolling of Commodities is done upon the
land, after the goods are unladen, and not whileſt they are aboard
the Ship or Veſſel, and therein ſo ſtowed, as that they can neither
be numbred, weighed, nor viewed. And the Port Town is here
only collectively named with other Cities, Towns, Markets, and
Places, (as appeareth plainly by the words of the Statute, as they
run together) to include all ſorts of Towns; nor doth, or ever
did the Admiral any more meddle with the priſing, taxing, or tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of Commodities within any ſuch Towns, more then he doth
or did with the Cuſtomes thereof.</p>
               <p>3. That no Pourveyors ſhould take any Sea-fiſh, brought in
ſuch Ships, under the forfeiture of the double value.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:62625:38"/>
4. That no man ſhall buy of any Stranger, or out of any Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
Bottom any Herring, or other Sea-fiſh not ſalted, packed or
casked, under pain of the forfeiture of the fiſh ſo bought, or the
value thereof.</p>
               <p>5. That no Wares may be carried from any Port of this Realm
to another.</p>
               <p>6. That all Codd and Lings be brought into this Realm looſe,
and not in barrels.</p>
               <p>7. That no Wine be brought forth of <hi>France,</hi> nor any Wood
brought into <hi>England</hi> but in <hi>Engliſh</hi> bottoms, all under pain of
forfeiture: And being ſo, they are by this Statute become to be
of the nature of prohibited Commodities; for diſcovery where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
there be in all Ports certain Searchers appointed which bring
the ſame under forfeiture; and the Admiral deals not therewith,
but only with ſuch prohibited Commodities as are prohibited to
be tranſported beyond the ſeas, and are <hi>de facto</hi> ſo tranſported,
having eſcaped the Searchers hands. And in ſuch caſes the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty
hath the power of puniſhing ſuch as have ſo offended;
for that the fact cannot be made appear but by examination
thereof by way of Commiſsion out of the Admiralty in the place
where the ſaid goods were unladen and landed.</p>
               <p>The reſtraint therefore upon the Admiral and Warden of the
Cinque-ports by this Statute in theſe caſes, is, leſt they, having
Juriſdiction as well upon the Havens and Ports of the ſea, being
parts and members thereof, as upon the main ſea, ſhould <hi>ampliare
juriſdictionem,</hi> and take the cognizance of theſe things to their
Courts, and abridge the Cuſtomers and ſearchers of that power
which belongeth unto their offices and places.</p>
               <p>And indeed this reſtraint in this Statute upon the Lord Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
the Judge of the Admiralty Court, and their Surrogates,
and upon the Lord Warden of the Cinque-ports and his Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
is a ſtrong argument that in other matters they have full
power, governance, and cognizance upon the Ports and Havens
as well as upon the main ſea; otherwiſe needed not theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
offences to have been excepted from their power and cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
there: and this exception of theſe particulars from their
cognizance there, concludeth other things in general there done to
belong thereunto: For <hi>quicquid accipitur in particulari, praeſumitur eſſe in
generali:</hi> The Admirals cognizance upon the Ports and Havens is
by this Statute excepted from theſe particular offences there done,
and is therefore preſumed to be full in other general offences there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
committed, and not otherwiſe excepted therefrom. And
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:62625:39"/>
other rules there be that confirme this Argument, as that, <hi>Id à quo
fit exceptio, fit univerſale, ut poſsit diſtribui:</hi> Theſe particular offences
are excepted from the Admirals cognizance upon the Ports and
Havens: and therefore his cognizance there muſt be univerſal;
ſo that from that univerſal cognizance there, theſe particulars
may be excepted and divided. And, <hi>Id quod excipitur, ſeu ſubjectum
exceptum, debet contineri ſub excipiente, ſeu eo à quo excipitur:</hi> and again:
<hi>Quod excipitur debet eſſe anguſtius eo à quo excipitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And further, the reſtraining of the Admirals Juriſdiction from
medling with theſe particulars, upon the Ports and Havens,
doth not reſtrain his power from medling with other matters
or offences done, and committed thereon; for the barring of his
cognizance of theſe particulars there, is but a limitation of his
general power there; <hi>Et omnis limitatio fit per id quod ſubjecto aut prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicato
congreuenter ineſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the Argument then, that is deduced from this Statute,
which concludeth that the limits of the Lord Admirals Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
are thereby deſcribed, and by the judgement of the whole
Parliament (as is aſſerted) confined unto the main ſea, or coaſts
of the ſea, there is no other queſtion to be made of it, then whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it ſhall overthrow and deſtroy all theſe Logical rules, or they
it. Another anſwer may be given to this argument, by diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing
upon the word Port or Haven, as it is taken in a double
conſtruction, and beareth a double acceptance, warranted by Mr.

properly is a ſafe place of harbour for Ships, but may be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any priviledge at all: and then maketh mention of ſuch
as are alwayes graced with legal priviledges; and for this he
quoteth the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> in theſe words: <hi>Quod omnes
communitates &amp; Barones de quinque portubus, &amp; omnes alii portus, habeant
omnes libertates &amp; liberas conſuetudines:</hi> that all common Societies of
Ports, and Barons of the Cinque-ports, and all other Ports may
have their liberties, &amp;c. which can be no otherwiſe underſtood,
then that thereby is meant the common Societies of Port-towns,
the Barons of the five principal Port-towns, and all other Port-towns
may have their priviledges, &amp;c. ſo that a Port-town is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
termed a Port, as well as the Port it ſelf; and ſo is a
Haven Town, &amp;c. though not ſo properly. And the words of
the Statute (ſaith he) confirme my former definition of Ports to
be true; and this is his definition; A Port is a harbour, and ſafe
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:62625:39"/>
arrival for Ships, Boats, and Ballengers of burthen to freight
and unfreight them at, not in: ſo that we ſee that he maketh
the Haven where Ships lie at anchor, to be a Port, and the Town
whereat they lade and unlade, to be a Port; and ſo the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
maketh <hi>coſteram maris</hi> to contain the ſhoar and banks, as well
as that part of the ſea adjoyning thereunto: and he proveth it out
of the Statute 27 of <hi>Eliz. cap</hi> 24. which Act was made for the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the banks and ſea-works on the ſea-coaſt. And out of
the <hi>7th</hi> chapter of <hi>Macchabees,</hi> where <hi>Demetrius</hi> Son of <hi>Seleucus</hi> came
to a City of the ſea-coaſt, &amp;c. <hi>ut in ejus libro p.</hi> 32. ſo that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
acceptance the places adjoyning to the Sea-coaſts for their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacency,
are called and taken for Coaſts, as well as the Coaſts
themſelves; and the Towns or Cities adjoyning to the Ports,
for their adjacency, are termed Ports as well as the Ports them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
and then it may very well be anſwered, that the words
in this Statute, out of any Haven or Port, are meant of the City
or Town thereunto adjoyning, and ſo called: and this, the offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in that Statute mentioned, unto which this clauſe hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
and relation, will warrant. But more I ſhall not ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this argument, but ſhall come to that which the ſame
Author further inferreth upon his own concluſion, when as his
premiſſes can no way be granted; which is that of <hi>Job</hi> the <hi>38th</hi>
chapter, the 8, 10, 11. verſes, That Almighty God (as he himſelf
out of a whirlwind ſpake) hath ſhut up the ſea within certain
dores or bounds: <hi>Quis concluſit mare oſtiis, quando erumpebat quaſi de
vulvâ praecedens? Circumdedi illud terminis meis, &amp; poſui vectem &amp; oſtia,
&amp; dixi, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſque huc venies, &amp; non procedes amplius, &amp; hîc confringes tumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
fluctus tuos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence I do conceive that he would inferre, that God then put
the dores of the ſeas, where he himſelf by his interpretation of
this Statute would now put them, between the high Seas and the
Ports and Havens. But then he muſt have ſaid, that when God
put them there, he then left them wide open, and never ſhut them
ſince; for ſure I am the ſea was never yet ſhut out of the Ports
and Havens, if we mean the Ports and Havens where ſhips do
ride, or lye at anchor; and not the Port or Haven Towns ſo
termed, by reaſon of their adjacency ſo near unto them. Nor can
it be allowed by what is here urged, that there they were put
ſtanding wide open: for he that ſaith <hi>poſui vectem &amp; oſtia,</hi> ſaith <hi>&amp;


dixi, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſque huc venies, &amp; non amplius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that we ſee his doctrine ſuits not to this text; but the text it
ſelf may very well ſerve for my purpoſe, that God himſelf hath
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62625:40"/>
put the gates and dores of the ſea, and hath himſelf appointed
its limits and bounds to be thoſe, within which it is by his own
power terminated.</p>
               <p>And look how farre it extendeth it ſelf, ſo farre it is ſea; and
there, and no where but there, hath God placed theſe gates and
dores, and terminated its limits and bounds by man unalterable.</p>

to the forme and effect of the ſaid Statutes; the parties ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
deſcended to an Iſſue, which was found for the Plaintiffe,
and damages to 700 <hi>l.</hi> And this is the Judgement he quoteth, <hi>Et

               <p>And he ſaith that it appeareth by the Record, that this being
the firſt Caſe that can yet be found, that received judgement in
the Court of Common-pleas upon the ſaid Statutes, and that the
ſame depended in adviſement and deliberation eight Terms,
whereby it plainly appears (the time being computed from the
making of the ſaid Statutes, whereon this Action was grounded
to the time of the Judgement 6 <hi>Hen.</hi> 6.) that the Courts of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-law
had not for above 20 years after the making of theſe
Statutes, ever medled with cauſes of this nature. Nor can it (I
am confident) be found that caſes of this nature, were any of
thoſe caſes wherein the Admirals had encroached upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-law,
before the making of the ſaid Statutes; and what
ground theſe Statutes then gave them for this Judgement, I could
wiſh he had reported with the Judgement it ſelf. The Statutes I
have endeavoured (to the utmoſt of my weak skil) to examine
one by one, but cannot find that in ſuch caſes as this the Admiralty
was by them in any wiſe prohibited to proceed: of which Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mine, I ſhall hereafter render the beſt Accompt I can, more
eſpecially when I come to treat of Contracts made at land of and
concerning maritime and ſea affairs;<note n="d" place="margin">Infra lib. 3. cap. 2.</note> but I muſt here in the
firſt place examine the obſervations by Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> himſelf
gathered out of this Judgement.</p>
               <p>From the whole he gathereth theſe four obſervations.</p>
               <p>1. That it is <hi>contemporannea expoſitio,</hi> being made within 20 years
of the making of one of the ſaid Statutes; and he ſaith that <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporanea
expoſitio eſt optima.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. That albeit the ſaid three Ships, with the Priſoners and
Merchandizes in them, lay in the Haven <hi>inter fluxum &amp; refluxum
aquae,</hi> and <hi>infra primos pontes,</hi> yet that the Haven is <hi>infra corpus Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitatûs,</hi>
and that for taking of the Ships, with the Priſoners and
Merchandizes in the ſame, no Suit ought to be had in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty
Court, but at the Common Law.</p>
               <p>3. That the Court of Admiralty hath no Juriſdiction, but <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
altum mare,</hi> which is not within any County; for the Record
ſaith (as he averreth) that the ſaid three Ships, with the Priſoners
and Merchandizes in the ſame, did lie <hi>infra Comitat.</hi> Briſtoliae, <hi>&amp;


non ſuper altum mare,</hi> as the Plaintiffe in the Admiralty Court ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
the ſame to be.</p>
               <p>4. That this Judgement ſo ſolemnly, and with ſuch adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
given, if it were alone, were ſufficient to give full ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62625:41"/>
in this point: for, ſaith he, <hi>Judicium eſt tanquam juris dictum,
&amp; judicium pro veritate accipitur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I conceive that by two of theſe four obſervations (the firſt and
the laſt) he endeavoureth to prove that this Judgement is a good
Judgement, which ought to be obſerved ever after for Law;
which if he hath thereby proved, the two other (the ſecond and
third) may be deduced into ſome concluſion, otherwiſe not. He
then that will examine the argument comprehended in theſe two
obſervations, muſt deduce it thus (or elſe he ſhall find no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
therein at all) <hi>viz.</hi> a Judgement given <hi>per contemporaneam ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitionem</hi>
of a Statute or Statutes made within twenty years after
the making of one of them, and that ſolemnly upon two years
adviſement given, is a good Judgement; which ought ever after
to be obſerved for Law. But this Judgement was given by a
contemporary expoſition of the ſaid Statutes, made within twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years after the making of one of them, and that ſolemnly with
adviſement by the ſpace of two years; therefore this Judgement
is to be obſerved for Law ever after: then will the other two ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
be eaſily deduced into a concluſion; otherwiſe not. But
I muſt crave leave that without offence I may call into queſtion
the truth of the premiſſes, out of which this concluſion is deduced.</p>
               <p>Firſt then, whether a Judgement given <hi>per contemporaneam expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitionem</hi>
of a Statute made within the ſpace of twenty years next
before ſuch interpretation or expoſition (though ſolemnly adviſed
on by the ſpace of eight Terms, which is two whole years) muſt
neceſſarily be ever after obſerved for law, is that which firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
in queſtion. Under correction I conceive that neither the
time of ſuch interpretation or expoſition-making, nor the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate
adviſement thereupon, conclude this neceſſity, that the
Judgement thence proceeding muſt be ever after obſerved, nay,
I conceive it ought not ever after, or at all to be obſerved, unleſs
ſuch expoſition be grounded upon both law and reaſon, or at
leaſt one of them.</p>
               <p>This is ſaid to be the firſt and leading Caſe, and ſo the firſt expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of thoſe three before mentioned Statutes made to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe:
and therefore the law and reaſon whereupon ſuch expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
had its ground and foundation, might very well have been
expected to have been there by him ſet down, where the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it ſelf is urged; but finding neither, I have according to my
weak abilities endeavoured to ſearch both or either of them out;
But indeed am ſo thick-ſighted, that I can find out neither the
one nor the other to warrant the ſame.</p>
               <p>

The Statute of the 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> 5. before<note n="d" place="margin">Supra cap. 4. hujus 2. lib. Super eod. cap.</note> mentioned and urged
for the proof of this aſſertion might, had it been made before
this expoſition of the other three, have ſet ſome colour thereon,
but no more then a colour: for there is nothing therein contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſubſtantial, that could have afforded this interpretation of the
other three; but coming after this interpretation, this interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
hath loſt that colour, and is left upon the Statutes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
wherein I for my part cannot find one word that doth
ſeem ſo much as to lead toward any ſuch expoſition or interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>The firſt of them is that of the 13 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. 5. which Statute

thereof ought to be grounded, according to the manner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

as the Statute is ſo abſolutely free from diſtinguiſhing any one part

concerneth Contracts, Pleas, and Complaints, and other things
done, ariſing within the bodies of Counties, as well by land as
by water, (and wreck of ſea) which will come to be<note n="h" place="margin">Infra lib. 3. cap. 5.</note> treated
of hereafter. The ſecond part conſidereth his Juriſdiction <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſivè,</hi>
retaining and upholding the ſame within the limits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of:
And in regard the Sea floweth ſometimes further, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

Juriſdiction ſomewhat uncertain, it therefore reduceth it
to a certainty, ſetting forth how farre it ſhall extend, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
it is ſaid in the former part (as well by land as by water)
and diſtinguiſheth how farre the water is to be taken to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the bodies of Counties, and how farre not, which followeth
in theſe words: <hi>Nientmeyns de mort de home &amp; de maheym faitz en

can conceive that the expreſsing of ſome particulars cognizable
in the Admirals Court doth reſtrain his cognizance unto thoſe
particulars only: for certainly thoſe particulars in the reading
of this Statute muſt and are emphatically expreſt, and ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,

of his cognizance in ſuch things, and the cauſes concerning
them: <hi>nam ſi majus eſt, etiam minus erit: &amp; cui majus convenit, etiam

Mr. Sergeant <hi>Callis</hi> in his Reading giveth this reaſon thereof, that
all Tryals at the Common Law are to be by Jury, which muſt
come out of a proper County; which in this caſe cannot be, the
Sea being in no County.</p>
               <p>This being the reaſon, doubtleſs the Ports and Havens at the
time of the making of this Statute were not accompted to be
within the bodies of Counties; for if they had, the Jury might
have been ſummoned out of that County, in whoſe body the
Port and Haven lay, whereon the death and maim of a man
ſhould happen, for to have tried the ſame: but the Ports and
Havens being not within the bodies of Counties, ſo that the death
and maim of a man thereon could not be tryed by a Jury ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
out of a proper County, according to the courſe of the
Common Law; therefore in expreſs terms was the triall thereof
appointed unto the Admiral, who even in ſuch caſes then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
according to the rules of the Civil Law, by which no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
was required, but ſo much the more exact proof.</p>
               <p>The ſame reaſon then, which is the reaſon that ſuch an Act
done at Sea could not be triable by the Law of the Land, muſt be
the reaſon why the like Act done upon any Port or Haven ſhould
be triable by the Civil Law, and not by that Law. But I ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
further to make it more plain, that this Statute neither did,
nor doth limit the Admiral to the cognizance of thoſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
only which are mentioned therein to be done or happen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
the firſt Bridges upon the Ports and Havens.</p>
               <p>All cauſes both Criminal and Civil, which have ariſen from
things done or happening upon Ports and Havens, as before, ſo
ever ſince the making of this Statute (excepting the interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

hath been ordered, judged, and determined before the

courſe of the Civil Law, the nature whereof is, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any Iudgement of death can be given againſt the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders,
either they muſt plainly confeſs their offences
(which they will never do without torture or pains) or elſe
their offences to be ſo plainly and directly proved by wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
indifferent, ſuch as ſaw their offences committed,
which cannot be gotten but by chance at few times, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſuch offenders commit their offences upon the Sea,
and many times murder and kill ſuch perſons, being in the
Ship or Boat where they commit their offencs, which
ſhould witneſs againſt them in that behalf and alſo ſuch
as ſhould bear witneſs be commonly Mariners, and Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
which becauſe of their often voyages and paſſages
on the Seas, depart without long tarrying and protra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of time, to the great coſt and charges as well of the
Kings Highneſs, as ſuch as would purſue ſuch offenders.
For reformation whereof be it enacted by the Authority of
this preſent Parliament, That all Treaſons, Felonies,
Robberies, Murders and Confederacies hereafter to be
committed in or upon the Sea, or in any other Haven, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
Creek, or Place where the Admiral or Admirals have
or pretend to have power, authority or juriſdiction, ſhall be
enquired, tryed, heard, determined and adjudged in ſuch
Shires and Places in the Realm, as ſhall be limited by
the Kings Commiſsion or Commiſsions to be directed for
the ſame in the like forme, and condition, as if any ſuch
offence or offences had been committed or done in or upon
the Land, and ſuch Commiſsions ſhall be had under the
Kings great Seal directed to the Admiral or Admirals,
or to his or their Lieutenant, Deputy, or Deputies; and
to three or four ſuch other ſubſtantial perſons as ſhall be
named and appointed by the Lord Chancellor of England
for the time being, from time to time, and as oft as need
ſhall require, to hear and determine ſuch offences after the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:62625:43"/>
common courſe of the Laws of this Land uſed for Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
Felonies, Robberies, Murders, and Confederacies
of the ſame done and committed upon the land within this
Realm.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>This Statute plainly ſheweth, that before the making thereof,
the offences of all Traitors, Pirats, Theeves, Robbers and their
Confederates, done, or committed upon the Sea, without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing
the main Sea from the Ports, Creeks, and Havens
thereof, or excluding them therefrom, as well as the offences of
Murderers and Meighmers of men were ordered, judged, and
determined before the Admiral, his Lieutenant or Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary:
Nay, by the reaſon given in this Statute for the alteration
<note n="*" place="margin">Or rather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition'd to the manner of try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; for the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of tryal is not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by this.</note> of this Triall, the Ports and Havens do appear to be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
in the word <hi>Sea,</hi> where it is ſaid that many times the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
do murder and kill ſuch perſons, and the Witneſſes being
in the Ship or Boat, where they commit their offences, which
ſhould witneſs againſt them in that behalf. Now ſurely all the
ſaid offences which were done or committed in Ships or Boats,
and were cognizable before the Admiral or his Lieutenant or
Commiſſary, might be, and were committed as well in Ships and
Boats, which did ride or lie at anchor within the Havens, Creeks,
and Ports of the Sea, as upon the high Sea. Yet if this be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
what followeth in the Act will make it more plain, <hi>viz.
<hi>That all Treaſons, Felonies, Robberies, Murders, and
Confederacies hereafter to be committed in or upon the
Sea, or in any other Haven, River, Creek, or place where
the Admirals have, or pretend to have power, authority
or Juriſdiction, ſhall be enquired, tryed, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that we ſee here the ſame criminal offences acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged
to have heretofore been tryable by the Civil Law,
and that it is now enacted, that hereafter the ſame offences com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
upon the Sea, may be otherwiſe enquired, tryed, &amp;c.
And leaſt any doubt ſhould ariſe, how farre the Sea heretofore
extended, therefore it is added, or any other Haven, River, or
Place, where the Admiral or Admirals have or pretend to have
Power, Authority, or Juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>Again, had theſe Havens, Rivers, and Creeks ever been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the bodies of Counties, ſo that a Jury might have been had
out of a proper County for the Tryall of theſe offences thereon
committed, then needed not this Statute have appointed any ſuch
tryall thereof by Jury, to be choſen out of any County limited
by the Kings Commiſsion proper or not proper. Nor aſſuredly
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:62625:44"/>
would this Stature have given the cognizance of theſe offences
committed within the bodies of Counties to the Lord Admiral
and his Deputies.</p>
               <p>Now if theſe Havens, Rivers, and Creeks were ſo farre out of
the bodies of Counties, that a Jury could not, nor yet can be had
out of a proper County, but muſt be had out of any County by
the King, in Chancery appointed, for the tryal of theſe criminal
cauſes, ariſing from theſe offences thereon committe, I conceive
it will ſeem ſtrange that it ſhould be affirmed that the ſame Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
Rivers, and Creeks ſhould be ſo farre within the bodies of
Counties, that a Jury might, or may be had out of a proper
County, for the tryal of ſuch Civil cauſes as might or may ariſe
from Civil matters thereon had or done; ſo that I cannot by the
uttermoſt of my endeavour find out the foundation either of law
or reaſon, whereon this Judgement was built. Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>
not ſeldome termeth it a Maxime in the Common Law, <hi>Quòd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo
debet videri prudentior lege,</hi> that no man ought to ſeem wiſer then
the Law: and truly from this Maxime (as he termeth it) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
as ſtrong a concluſion may be drawn, <hi>viz. Quod hiſce ſtatutis
nulli prudentiores videri deberent,</hi> none ought to have ſeemed wiſer
then theſe Statutes themſelves. But indeed as this Judgement
hath been by ſome accepted as grounded upon law, ſo hath it
been by more, and thoſe learned in the Law, refuſed and rejected
as not grounded thereon, as I ſhall hereafter ſhew, by Writs <hi>de
Procedendo,</hi> awarded out of the Chancery upon Injunctions thence
granted, and Conſultations both out of the Kings Bench and
Common-pleas, upon Prohibitions thence granted upon cauſes
of the ſelf ſame nature.</p>
               <p>Now I hope by what hath been ſaid, &amp; ſhall hereafter be ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
it plainly will appear, that this firſt and leading Judgement
was not ſo grounded either upon law or reaſon, or upon ſo ſound
a foundation, as that men in ſucceeding ages ſhould build their
judgements thereupon, nor ſo complete or fit a guide or rule, as
that Lawgivers ſhould be directed thereby (although it had been
<hi>contemporanea ſtatutorum expoſitio,</hi> made within 20 years of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of one of the ſaid Statutes, and that upon two years adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and deliberation, as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> affirmeth) which Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
or minor Propoſition, is as infirme as the major, and both
will leave the concluſion to ſtand alone without legs, which muſt
neceſſarily fall to the ground. Firſt then, that this was <hi>contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranea
expoſitio,</hi> made within the ſpace of twenty years next after
the making of one of theſe Statutes, will not be made good; for
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:62625:44"/>
the laſt of thoſe Statutes is that of 2 <hi>H. 4. cap.</hi> 11. which was <hi>anno</hi>
1400, and the Judgement was given the 6 <hi>H. 6. Hil.</hi> which was
<hi>anno</hi> 1427; and how this can be brought within the compaſs of
twenty years, which appears ſo plainly to be ſeven years without
the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ompaſs, I know not. Beſides, this Statute is only in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of that Statute 13 <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. 5. ſetting a penalty of double
damage unto the party grieved, and ten pounds to the King up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
him that ſhall offend againſt this Statute of the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>Richard</hi>
the Second. Now it is true this Judgement doth purſue this
Statute in giving double damages to the Plaintiffe, and the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
of ten pounds to the King againſt the Defendant: But the
giving of theſe double damages and penalty is grounded upon
the breach of the former Statute, unto which only this hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation;
and this Statute neither needed, nor had it any expoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
at all: But the Judgement was grounded upon an Expoſition
made of the former Statute 13 <hi>Ric.</hi> 2. upon which (if the Statute
would have born any ſuch conſtruction) the Party ſuing in the
Admiralty contrary to that Statute in a cauſe of the ſame nature,
would have before the making of the Statute of the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>H.</hi> 4.
been liable to the ſingle damages, though not to the double; but
the Law whereon this Expoſition was made to ground this Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ought to have been ſome Law that declareth a Haven to be
within the body of a County, and without the Juriſdiction of
the Admiralty, and muſt needs have been before the making of
this Statute, if there had been any ſuch at all, which I believe can
never be found or ſhewed: For ſure I am (as I ſaid before)
there is not one word in the Statute it ſelf, which can ſo much
as ſeem to draw any man to imagine that a Haven or Port ſhould
be within the body of a County; but however it is the expoſition
of this Statute (though groundleſs) upon which the Judgment
is founded, and this Statute was made eleven years before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
and then will this <hi>contemporanea expoſitio,</hi> ſaid to be within
twenty years, ſcarce fall to be within twice twenty years: For
the Statute made in the <hi>13th</hi> year of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond was made
in <hi>anno</hi> 1389, and the judgment was given in <hi>anno</hi> 1427 which is
full 38 years; and ought not to have had an expoſition put upon
it, clean deſtructive to another Statute made within two years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and in the ſame Kings Raign, which cleareth the Admirals
Juriſdiction to be over the havens and rivers beneath the firſt
bridges neareſt to the ſea, even of the death of a man &amp;c. which
is <hi>magis contemporanea et multo ſtabilior expoſitio,</hi> being made upon as
good adviſement as this, though perhaps not upon terms of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62625:45"/>
which conſideration I come to conſider next: And
I cannot conceive the adviſement upon two years deliberation
upon one particular point, ſhould render the determination
thereof ever the more ſound, but rather ſheweth a great deal of
doubting and fearfulneſs to determine. But it ſeems after two
years deliberation they determined to have the Ports and Havens
(without any warrant of Law that Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> hath declared,
or that I can by any means find) to be within the bodies of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
And truly I think the time was ſhort enough, and their
pains great enough in that ſpace, to turn ſo much ſea, or water
appertaining unto the ſea, into land, or into the heart of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
But if the foundation of this Judgement be infirme, ſurely
it will not ſupport it, being ſo weighty a Judgement as it is, but
that the ſame muſt fall to the ground, and be buried in the earth,
or drowned in the depth of that Sea, it would have diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
of its Ports, Creeks and Havens, unleſs whatſoever a Court
ſhall once adjudge through miſapprehenſion, or any manner of
miſunderſtanding, muſt ever after be obſerved for law; which
whoſoever affirmeth, muſt maintain ſome men to be infallible,
or elſe that one injuſtice may be a warrant for another: But if to
perſiſt in an error, be another, and a greater error, then ſurely to
ſquare juſtice by ſo crooked and untryed a rule, can produce no

                  </gap>oth of this, and the other which
he inſtanceth in, which is a Premunire brought 9 <hi>H.</hi> 7. for a
Suit in the Admiralty Court before <hi>John</hi> Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> for taking
and carrying away <hi>quandam naviculam apud Horton Key</hi> at <hi>South-Lyn,

corpus comitatûs,</hi> is no way conſequent or concludent to prove the
Ports and Havens to be within the bodies of Counties.</p>
               <p>For the firſt of theſe, it is plainly affirmed that <hi>John Caſſy</hi> did
take away the goods he was ſued for in the Admiralty Court at
<hi>Stratford Bow,</hi> being a Town or Pariſh plainly within the body
of the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and no Haven or Haven-Town. This
ſuggeſtion being proved, the Admiral had no colour at all to take
cognizance of this cauſe.</p>
               <p>For the taking and carrying away of the little Ship, little
Barque or Boat (for <hi>navicula</hi> ſignifieth either of the three) at <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
Key</hi> at <hi>South-Lynne,</hi> it concludeth nothing againſt the Admirals
Juriſdiction upon the Haven or Port, taken for the water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
the firſt Bridge: for a Key is often taken for the Wharfe,
or place whereon goods are uſually landed; but ſtrictly it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for the very ſeparation of the land from the water, by wood
or ſtone, or both in ſuch places as goods are uſually landed at:
and theſe are the keys that lock thoſe dores that Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>
would have ſtand wide open, placed by God himſelf to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:62625:46"/>
ſo farre within the Seas. Now <hi>At Horton Key</hi> may be as well
on the dry ſide of the Key, as on the wet; as well upon the land
as upon the water: and little Ships, little Barques, or Boats are
oftentimes drawn up at the Keys, where they arrive, to be caulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and repaired, and might be from thence taken and carried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
perhaps from the water (their accuſtomed Element) to the
fire, wherewith for the moſt part, when they eſcape drowning,
they are at laſt conſumed, when they are become unſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>Again, theſe two Premunire's are ſaid only to have been
brought, and nothing ſaid of the event, or what was determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
thereon; ſo that here is nothing but the opinion of thoſe
that brought them, and no reſolution of the Judges; and ſo
theſe two Praemunire's conclude nothing at all.</p>
               <p>But grant two ſuppoſitions (neither to be granted nor ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
unleſs proved) <hi>viz.</hi> that theſe two ſeverals Acts were done or
committed upon Ports and Havens, and that the determination
and reſolution of the Judges was againſt the Defendants; yet he
that will but look, may ſee the two foundations whereon theſe
determinations or reſolutions were or ſhould have been built,
from whence this land Argument is raiſed, to have been laid
upon the ſea ſands, too ſlippery a place for them to ſtand on;
the one is that before mentioned groundleſs ſuppoſition of the
Ports and Havens being within the bodies of Counties; for
which no proof is offered; but that ſome againſt all reaſon, and
they know not wherefore, have taken them ſo to be. The other
is the Statute upon which theſe Praemunire's were brought, which
he affirmeth to be the Statute 16 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. for ſuing in <hi>Curiâ Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nâ
vel alibi,</hi> of matters belonging to the Common Law.</p>
               <p>This Statute conſiſteth of a Petition made by the Commons
unto the King, and the King's Anſwer thereunto, as all ancient
Statutes of thoſe dayes do. In the Petition is firſt ſet forth that
the King and all his liege People ought of right, and of old time
were wont to ſue in the Kings Court to recover their preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to Churches, Prebends, and other Benefices of holy
Church, to which they had right to preſent, &amp;c. And when
Judgement was given in the ſame Court upon ſuch a Plea and
Preſentment, the Archbiſhops, Biſhops, and other Spiritual per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
which had the Inſtitutions unto ſuch Benefices within their
Juriſdiction, were bound and did make execution of ſuch Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
by the Kings Commandments, of all the time aforeſaid
without interuption, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:62625:47"/>
And in the next place they do complain, that of late divers Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
had then been made by the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and Cenſures of
Excommunication upon certain Biſhops of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe they
had made execution of ſuch commandments to the open deſheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of the Crown, &amp;c. And further complaining that alſo it was
ſaid, and a common clamour was made, that the ſaid Biſhops of
<hi>Rome</hi> had then ordained and purpoſed to tranſlate ſome Prelates
of the ſame Realm, ſome out of the Realm without the Kings
aſſent and knowledge, and ſome out of one Biſhoprick into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
within the ſame Realme, without the Kings aſſent and
knowledge, and without the aſſent of the Prelates ſo to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
which Prelates were much profitable and neceſſary to the
King and his Realme; by which the Statutes of the Realm would
become defeated, &amp;c. And nothing more is contained in the ſaid
Petition, but what concerneth the premiſſes. The King in his
Anſwer doth ordain, That if any purchaſe or purſue, or cauſe to
be purchaſed or purſued in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> or elſwhere, any
ſuch Tranſlations, Proceſſes, and Sentences of Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Bulls, Inſtruments, or any other thing whatſoever, which
touch the King, againſt Him, his Crown and Regality, or his
Realm, as is aforeſaid: And they which bring within the Realm,
or them receive, or make thereof notification, or any other exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
whatſoever, within the ſame Realm or without, That
they, their Notary, Procurators, Maintainers, Abetters, Fautors,
and Counſellors, ſhall be put out of the Kings Protection, and
their Lands and Tenements, Goods and Chattels forfeited to our
Lord the King, that they may be attached by their bodies, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In theſe antient Statutes, which are by way of Petition and
Anſwer, the Anſwer hath alwayes relation to the Petition, and
granteth what is therein deſired; ſometimes leſs, but never more:
by this Petition nothing is deſired but the reſtraint of the Popes
power, and aſſumed authority in thoſe things therein expreſt;
nor is there any thing more in the Anſwer granted, if theſe words
in the genuine ſence thereof be duly examined, which can be no
other then this. If any purchaſe, &amp;c. in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> or
elſwhere from the Pope, or any Power or authority derived from
him, <hi>viz.</hi> either in his Court at <hi>Avignon,</hi> which he ſometimes held
there, or any other Eccleſiaſticall Court under his Supremacy,
whether beyond the Seas, or in the Realm of <hi>England:</hi> (For we
well know that in thoſe dayes the Pope did challenge a power
over the Eccleſiaſtical Courts here as ſubjected unto him, as their
ſupreme only, or at leaſt as well as the King) and of theſe Courts
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:62625:47"/>
and none other can this <hi>[elſewhere]</hi> be underſtood, as will plainly
alſo appear, by the things ſpecified in this anſwer, to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
and purſued, <hi>viz.</hi> If any purchaſe or purſue in the Court
of <hi>Rome,</hi> or elſewhere, any ſuch Tranſlations, Proceſſes, and Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
of Excommunications, Bulls, &amp;c. Now cannot theſe
things, nor could they elſewhere, or in any other place beſides
the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> be purchaſed or purſued, but from the Pope
or his Authority in thoſe other Courts before mentioned. Again,
theſe words <hi>[elſe where]</hi> were neceſſarily inſerted, and neceſſarily
to be underſtood of thoſe Courts under the Popes authority, from
whom and whoſe authority thoſe things were to be purchaſed
and purſued <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> otherwiſe, whoſoever had purchaſed any of them
elſewhere, to wit in any of theſe other Courts, under his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and not in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> had not been by this Statute
lyable to the puniſhment thereof. But ſome perhaps may ſay, I
have here purpoſely waved the general words, which cloſe up the
particular ſpecified things forbidden to be purchaſed, or purſued,
<hi>viz.</hi> Bulls, Inſtruments, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> any other things whatſoever, which
words perhaps may ſeem to have relation to <hi>[elſe where]</hi> and be
thought to be of ſo large an extent, that the words <hi>[elſe where]</hi> muſt
be ſtretched to all places whatſoever, beyond other Courts of the
Popes, or under his authority: But indeed I intended it not.
But as they are the laſt words, which cloſe up the particulars
ſpecified, ſo I reſerved them to the laſt place, wherein I ſhall
diſcloſe and clear that doubt.</p>
               <p>When ſeveral particulars then of the ſame nature are cloſed up
with a general, that general comprehendeth all other particulars
of that nature, and nothing of a different and diſtinct quality.
So here theſe general words <hi>[or any other things whatſoever]</hi> muſt be
underſtood of any other thing whatſoever of the ſame nature
with thoſe Tranſlations, Proceſſes, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And this is plain enough by the words themſelves, if ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
obſerved, and rightly underſtood. For take them as they run,
and they carry their limitation with them, which bindeth them
cloſe, and reſtraineth them unto what precedeth in the Petition.</p>
               <p>And as the <hi>Court of Rome</hi> and <hi>elſewhere,</hi> have relation to the Pope,
to the Popes Court at <hi>Rome,</hi> and unto his Courts elſewhere, ſo muſt
theſe words <hi>[Inſtruments, and other things whatſoever]</hi> have reference
and relation thereunto. And then take theſe words, as they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
the Petition, and they can bear no other ſenſe then this,
<hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereupon our Lord the King by the aſſent aforeſaid, and at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62625:48"/>
of the ſaid Commons, hath ordained and eſtabliſhed, that if any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
or purſue, or cauſe to be purchaſed or purſued in the Popes Court of
<hi>Rome,</hi> or any other of his Courts elſewhere, any ſuch Tranſlations, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes,
and Sentences of Excommunications, Bulls, Inſtruments, or any other
things whatſoever, which touch the Kings protection, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So that upon the matter Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> here doth but tell us
how theſe parties were accuſed, againſt whom theſe Praemuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
were brought; for certainly this Statute in a right conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
could not be applyed againſt them for ſuing in the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty
Court. And his inſtancing herein plainly carraigneth the
Judgement which he before uſed for an argument againſt the
Admirals Juriſdiction upon Ports and Havens, and indeed may
ſufficiently ſerve to ſhew how groundleſly a word in a Statute
may be, and hath been wreſted and catcht at, to diminiſh and
ſtraighten the Juriſdiction of the Admiralty, and enlarge the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
extraordinary large power of the Common Law. Nor are
theſe Interpretations or Conſtructions in any wiſe contemporary
with the Statutes (as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> would have them) but taken
up a long time after, and crept into their Law, as hereſies do into
Religion, by new conſtructions of Scripture: Neither indeed
can either the Judgement, or any of theſe Praemunires inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in be ſaid to be contemporary with the ſaid Statutes.</p>
               <p>For further proof of this point, he inſtanceth in four or five
Prohibitions unto the Court of Admiralty, for holding plea of
Contracts made upon Ports or Havens, and beyond the Seas.
But to theſe I ſhall give an anſwer hereafter, when the Contracts
made at land concerning Maritime affairs ſhall come to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted

               </p>
               <p>Out of which the Author obſerveth four things.</p>
               <p>1. That it is called the Sea, which is not within any County,
from whence a Jury may come.</p>
               <p>2. That the Sea (being not within any County) is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Juriſdiction of the Court of Common-pleas, but belongs
to the Admirals Juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>3. That when the Ship came within the River, then it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
to be within the County of <hi>Northumberland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>4. That when a taking is partly on the Sea, and partly in a
River, the Common Law ſhall have Juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>For the firſt Obſervation, which is, that that is called Sea
which is not in any County from whence a Jury may come;
I may very well grant it, and he yet never the nearer the proof of
that he aimeth at, <hi>viz.</hi> that a Port or Haven is within any County
out of which a Jury may come, which is abſolutely denied; the
reaſon whereof, as<note n="c" place="margin">Sup. cap. 5. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>For his ſecond obſervation, that the Sea not being in any
County, is not within the Juriſdiction of the Court of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-pleas,
ſhall not be denyed him: but I muſt crave leave to
obſerve with him, That notwithſtanding this Ship was taken
upon the Seas, where there was neither Town nor Place from
whence a Jury could be taken; yet <hi>Berry</hi> the chief Juſtice took
cognizance of this Cauſe, and cauſed <hi>Mutford</hi> to anſwer: And
this might have ſerved him for as good an Argument to have
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:62625:49"/>
proved the Seas to be within the Juriſdiction of the Common
Law, as any that he hath uſed to prove the Ports and Havens to
be within the bodies of Counties, and out of the juriſdiction of
the Admiralty.</p>
               <p>For his third Obſervation, which is, that when the Ship came
within the River, it is confeſt to be within the County of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland:</hi>
I conceive, if <hi>Mutford</hi> might at the Common Law
have pleaded two Pleas, which in many caſes is neceſſary, and
allowable by the Civil Law, he would as well have denyed, that
ever he carried the Ship into the County of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> as he
did averre that he took her upon the Seas: and ſilence is not a
conſent, or confeſsion, where a man is tyed to one plea; and
hath divers to plead: This therefore is neither confeſſed by
<hi>Mutford,</hi> or any elſe, but by the Author himſelf, and ſuch as are
of his party: for <hi>Berry</hi> neither affirmeth nor determineth any
ſuch thing, or cauſeth him to anſwer upon any ſuch ground,
but upon this ground, that the King willeth the peace to be kept
as well on the ſea as on the land: And indeed the grounds are
both kept alike to ſound the cognizance of this Cauſe in the
Court of Common-pleas, whereas the King, that willeth
the peace to be kept as well on the ſeas as on the land, hath
provided, inſtituted and appointed from antient, and farre
paſt times, diſtinct Judges, Juſtices and Officers for the keeping
thereof on the one hand, and on the other: The Admiral, his
Deputies, and other Juſtices with him appointed for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereof upon the Seas; and the Judges of the Land, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Juſtices with them appointed for the keeping thereof upon
the Land; and neither have to do with the others Juriſdictions:
So that I cannot conceive, nor can I grant chief Juſtice <hi>Berrys</hi>
ground, whereon he founded this Replevin, and the taking this
Cauſe into cognizance to be <hi>Terra firma.</hi> And as for that which
Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> would have to be the ground of this Replevin,
and cognition of this Cauſe, namely becauſe, after ſhe was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
at Sea, ſhe was carried into a Port or Haven, which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteth
to be within the body of a County: If this ſhould be
allowed for a good ground, then muſt all Reprizals taken at
Sea by Letters of Marque, and brought into the Port and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
be exempted from their condemnation in the Admiralty
Court for lawfull prize, and may be ſet free by a Replevin gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
from the Common Law; and whatſoever fact done upon
the Seas, either by ſhip or man, the ſhip or man repairing to Port
or Haven, Juſtice muſt be had againſt them from the Common
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62625:49"/>
Law: So that by this conſtruction, the Admiral ſhall have no
cognizance of piracy, robberies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> committed at Sea, either
by the courſe of the Civil Law, or by the courſe of the Law of
the Land upon the before mentioned Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. but if
the Pyrats, or Robbers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall eſcape, and bring that which
they have ſtoln, or by violence taken away, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into any Port,
or Haven or to land, this pyracy, robbery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall be tryed at
the Common Law. And as well may it be ſaid that if they ſhall
be taken upon the Sea, and afterwards be brought into any Port,
or Haven, or to land, that then the Admirals Jurisdiction cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
and the tryal belongs to the Common Law: So that the
Admiral muſt go ſet up his Tribunal upon the high Seas (as Sir
<hi>Ed. Coke</hi> diſtinguiſheth them) if he will have any Jurisdiction at
all. And whatſoever injury ſhall happen to be done at Sea by
one Ship unto another, the Ship which did the injury, by repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to her Port or Haven, ſhall free her ſelf from the judgment
of the Admiralty Court, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Common Law ſhall free
the Judge of the Admiralty, and all the Officers belonging to that
Court from any further attendance there, which doubtleſs was
the aim of the Author, as will plainly appear, when I ſhall come
to ſum up all he would have: And I wiſh it be not the aim of
a great many ſtill, whoſe aim for their own ends muſt neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be deſtructive to a general good, as ſhall be likewiſe hereafter
ſhewn.</p>
               <p>For the Fourth Obſervation, which is that when a taking is
partly on the Sea, and partly in a River, the Common Law ſhall
have the juriſdiction.</p>
               <p>For this partly taking on the Sea, and partly on the River, I
muſt confeſs I know not how it can be: for a Ship is either taken
or not taken, when ſhe is taken at Sea; or taken or not taken,
when ſhe is taken upon the River, unleſs we can ſay that one
part of the Ship was upon the Sea, and the other part of her upon
the River, at the very inſtant time of her taking. But if the juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Admiralty may have its right, we ſhall have no need
of a Mathematitian to ſtrike a line between the Sea and the River,
to make the diſtinction, for indeed this diſtinction will be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
needleſs.</p>
               <p>But this Obſervation having relation to the matter of fact from
whence it is drawn, this meaning of taking partly on the Sea,
and partly on the River, muſt be that a Ship is ſo taken, when
ſhe is firſt taken at Sea, and then brought into ſome Port or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour,
which I ſhall leave to the judgement of the world, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:62625:50"/>
this Ship was taken on the Sea, or on the River, or can be
ſaid to be taken partly on the Sea, and partly on the River.</p>
               <p>And if this ſhall be determined to be a taking partly upon the
Sea, and partly upon the River; and that therefore the Common
Law ſhall take cognizance thereof; I muſt ſay (as I ſaid before)
the Common Law hereby ſhall take the whole Juriſdiction of
the Admiral to it ſelf. For what ſhip can be taken at ſea, or to
what end ſhall any ſhip be taken at Sea, if ſhe ſhall not be
brought into ſome Port or Haven, that ſhe and her goods may
be there diſpoſed of? And indeed all Ships that be there taken
by Letters of Marque, muſt be brought into Port or Haven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they break bulk: And the Common Law ſhall hereby caſt
off all Rules, and Laws of the Sea, whereby cauſes of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
have been always (ſuch interruptions excepted) diſcuſſed,
tryed, and determined between us and foraign Nations, and
between our own Merchants, and ſea-faring men, and try, and
determine them without either Rule or Law: For I could never
yet find that the Common Law ever afforded either Books, or
Preſidents to guide or direct them in the adjudging, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
of cauſes of that nature, which is a thing moſt requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
and neceſſary, the Forraigner (between whom and us ſuch
caſes for the moſt part happen) expecting to have his Ship and
goods confiſcated and condemned, or quit, and reſtored upon
the ſame terms, and according to the ſame Proceedings, Rules
and Laws, as ours are in foraign parts, which the Common
Law affordeth not, being onely a municipal Law for the guiding
and governing of the Subjects of this Nation in their land affairs
at home.</p>
               <p>Again I would gladly know how this Obſervation agreeth
with <hi>Lacies</hi> Caſe,; where one was ſtricken on the Seas, and dyed
on the Land, the Common Law could not try this murther; and
Serjeant <hi>Callis</hi> in his reading at <hi>Grays</hi>-Inn, An. 1622. <hi>in prima Lectura</hi>
p. 19.<note n="d" place="margin">Serj. <hi>Callis</hi> in 1. Lect. apud <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eſp. <hi>Grai. An.</hi> 1622.</note> giveth this reaſon thereof, becauſe that tryal was to
be by a Jury which muſt come out of a proper County, which
could not in this caſe, becauſe the Sea was not within any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
In this caſe the party received a mortal wound at Sea, and
was brought unto Land and there dyed; in the other caſe, the
Ship was taken at Sea, but brought into a Haven, and there unla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den;
here the party may more properly be ſaid to be partly killed
at Sea, and partly killed at Land, then the Ship can be ſaid to be
partly taken at Sea, and partly taken at Land, and yet the Land
ſhall not find a Jury for tryal of one, but the Sea Port ſhall find
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62625:50"/>
a Jury for the tryall of the other, which I ſhall leave to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
upon this his fourth obſervation, how farre the ſame will
hold water.</p>
               <p>Next he urgeth that 8 <hi>Ed. 2. tit. Coron.</hi> 399. it is no part of the
Sea where one may ſee what is done on one part of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and of the other; as to ſee from one Land to another:
And that the Coroner ſhall exerciſe his Office in this caſe, and
that of this the Country may have knowledge, whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
(ſaith he) that things done there are tryable by the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
(that is is to ſay by Jury) and conſequently not by the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty
Court.</p>
               <p>And after in another place of the ſame chapter he urgeth <hi>Stam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
l. 1. part. Coron. fol.</hi> 51. 6.<note n="e" place="margin">Stam. pl. coron. li. 1. fol. 51. 6.</note> to this very purpoſe: the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
which together can be no wrong to his Argument, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a ſtrengthening; for <hi>vis unita fortior,</hi> and ſo undertake the
anſwering of both together.</p>
               <p>And this is that (which he ſaith) <hi>Stamford</hi> ſaith: If one be
ſlain upon an arme of the Sea, where a man may ſee the land
of one part and of the other, the Coroner ſhall enquire of this,
and not the Admiral, becauſe the Country may take cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance,
and doth vouch the ſaid authority of 8 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. whereupon
he concludeth in theſe words: So this proveth that by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law before the Statute of 2. <hi>H.</hi> 4. the Admiral had no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
but upon the high Sea; which only authority (ſaith
Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>) is ſufficient to over-rule all the ſaid queſtions;
for (ſaith he) hereby it appeareth, that the Juriſdiction of the
Admiral is only confined by the Common Law to the high Sea,
and agreeth with all the Book-caſes and Acts of Parliament.</p>
               <p>For the firſt 8 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. which ſaith that it is no part of the Sea
where one may ſee what is done on one part of the water, and
on the other; that is indeed to be on the one ſide of the River,
and ſee &amp; diſcern what is done on the other; and that muſt be ſo
to ſee and diſcern, that he may perfectly judge of the action, yea,
and certainly of the party acting too, elſe can this ſeeing be to no
purpoſe. And hereby it may appear that the Admiral had in thoſe
times Juriſdiction upon all ebbing and flowing Rivers, ſo farre
as they continued of ſuch breadth, that one ſtanding on the one
ſide of the River could not ſee nor diſcern what was done, and
by whom on the other ſide: So that his Juriſdiction in ſome
places extendeth farre above the firſt Bridges; for what man is
ſo quick-ſighted, that ſtanding on the one ſide of the <hi>Thames,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the Bridge, can ſo diſcern as to judge of the actions of men
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62625:51"/>
on the other; and who, and what manner of men they are?
For to ſee, and not ſo exactly and judiciouſly diſcern in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judging
of ſuch actions, is as much as not to have ſeen at all.</p>
               <p>But this being too ambiguous and uncertain a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Sea Juriſdiction, and the Land, by reaſon of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
breadths in one and the ſame River, and the different appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of things by ſeveral mens eyes, and difference of the aire
at ſeveral times, being ſometimes thick and cloudy, ſometimes
ſerene and clear: The next Bridges unto the Seas have
been alwayes held the moſt certain diſtinction between them.
But indeed this Record is ſtretcht further, and indeed ſo farre
that it is impoſsible it ſhould hold; for by Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> it is
thus ſet down: It is no part of the Sea where one may ſee what
is done on one part of the water, and of the other (as to ſee from
one land to the other) as if there was no difference between ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what is done on the one part, and the other, and ſeeing from
one land to the other. Here to make ſure work with the Ports
and Havens, and to bring them within the compaſs of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roners
Office, he will bring the main Sea, his <hi>altum mare,</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
within the compaſs thereof: For he that will make that
to be no part of the Sea where one may ſee from one land to
the other, muſt needs make <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> to be one Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
which I ſee he ſpareth not to do, againſt the opinion of
the world; for ſure I am a man may ſee from <hi>Dover</hi> to <hi>Callis,</hi> and
yet all men have accounted <hi>Callis</hi> beyond the ſeas, from <hi>Dover,</hi> and
<hi>Dover</hi> beyond the ſeas from <hi>Callis;</hi> and yet for all this, if it were
poſsible with modeſty to grant him ſo much, yet can I not grant
that, becauſe the Coroner might exerciſe his Office in this caſe,
therefore the Admiral cannot exerciſe his; for it is but <hi>argumentum
ex contingenti, non ex neceſſario.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for that which he hath out of <hi>Stamford</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Stam. pl. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

purpoſe, but uſeth in another place of the ſame chapter to make
his arguments ſeem the more in number. <hi>Stamford</hi> is not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
of the truth of this aſſertion, as he is, and puts it not as
his opinion agreeing with the Record, but by way of a <hi>quaere,</hi>
ſeeking only what may be inferred from that Record.</p>
               <p>He in that place ſets down the diverſity of opinions of their
Books, concerning the extent of the Coroners Office; and ſaith
that <hi>Nedham</hi> ſaith, <hi>Que Coroner ne poit inquirer das cun felony fors que de
mort d' homme:</hi> that the Coroner cannot enquire of any felony
but of the death of a man, and yet he ſaith <hi>que in</hi> Northumberland

praeſcription, &amp;c.</hi> That in <hi>Northumberland</hi> they enquire of all felo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,
but this authority they maintain by preſcription; and
he ſaith that <hi>tit. coron. in Fitz. H. p. 206. preſent fuiſt devant le Coroner

&amp;c.</hi> It was preſented before the Coroner, that ſuch a one taken
for felony was conveyed to the Church of certain Fryers, and it
was adjudged a void Preſentment, becauſe he could not enquire
thereof by virtue of his Office, &amp;c. then he quoteth <hi>Britton</hi>

                  <hi>fol.</hi>
3. on the contrary, who ſaith <hi>Que il parent inquirer de rape de femme

&amp;c.</hi> That he may enquire of the raviſhment of a woman, and
of breaking of priſon, which are other felonies, which are not
of the death of a man. Then followeth that which is here urged
after this uncertainty of the Coroners power, thus ſet down:
<hi>Ideo quaere, &amp;c. ſi un ſoit occiſe on rees in les bracher on ſauſes del meere

An. 2 H. 4. c. 11. l' Admirall naver Juriſdiction ſe non ſur le haut meere,</hi>
wherein he miſ-quoteth the ſaid Statute, and doth not rightly
urge the words thereof, there being no ſuch word as <hi>haut</hi> either
in that Statute, or in the Statute of 13 <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. of which the latter
is only a confirmation with a penalty, the words being only <hi>ſur

a doubt, which otherwiſe would have been none, <hi>Ideo quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re,</hi>
therefore ſeek or be adviſed, whether or not, if one be ſlain
upon any arme of the Sea, where a man may ſee the Land on
one part and on the other, the Coroner ſhall enquire thereof, and
not the Admiral; becauſe, or for that the Country may take cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
of it, which (ſaith he) ſee in the ſaid title <hi>p.</hi> 399. So
(ſaith Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>) this that is deduced and drawn from this
authority, doth prove that by the Common Law, before this
Statute of 2 <hi>H. 4. c.</hi> 11. the Admiral had no Juriſdiction but upon
the high ſea, whereas <hi>Stamfords</hi> Quaere reſteth ſtill upon this
point; and he declareth not his own opinion therein, but lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
this as doubtful ſtill, as he did the extent of the Coroners Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
concerning Felonies before, which he might very well do,
this being raiſed upon ſo miſtaken a ground, which if it had been
rightly cited, he might have eaſily determined againſt Mr. <hi>Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </hi>
and have left no doubt behind him.</p>
               <p>Now we may ſee plainly by what Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> ſaith in the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62625:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
firſt place, where he voucheth this Record, that the Record (as
I ſaid before) is very far ſtretcht, and part which is from thence
deduced and drawn very far fetcht, to make ſeeing what is done
on one part of the water, and of the other, to be ſeeing from
one Land to the other; this by no Logical Rule can be allowed;
the other may, That is, a ſeeing from Land to Land, with
the limitation before mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſo to ſee as perfectly to
diſcern what is done on the other part of the water. Take this
ſeeing then with that limitation, without which it is as good as
no ſeeing (for a man to ſee, and not diſcern what he ſeeth to
guide and direct his Judgement, helpeth that man nothing in his
knowledge of what he is about to judge by his ſeeing) as I have
ſaid before. For doubtleſs the foundation of this opinion, if it
can be founded upon any reaſon (which all opinions are pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to be) muſt be that the witneſſes being on Land on one ſide
of the River may before the Coroner give their teſtimonies to the
Jury of and concerning a fact, which they ſaw and diſcerned to
be done, and how and in what manner the ſame was done on
the other ſide, and ſo <hi>ex conſequenti</hi> of a fact done, and how and
in what manner the ſame was done upon the ſame River, in
what part thereof ſoever, even in the extream part thereof to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the other ſide to the very bank; for that a quarrel, &amp;c.
might, or may be begun on one ſide, or in the midſt, or on any
other part thereof, and be determined by the death of one or
more, on the extream part thereof, toward the other ſide, that
there may be ſome colour to fetch a fact done upon ſuch a River
within Mr. Coroners cognizance, and the rather becauſe the
witneſſes upon the ſhore might happily be land-men, which by
his authority might be called to give their teſtimony in ſuch a
caſe: whereas in caſe the like fact ſhould happen to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in a Ship, or other Veſſel upon the Port or Haven, where
the witneſſes preſent at ſuch fact, and might ſee and diſcern the
ſame, for the moſt part were ſea-men, which had recourſe uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to other Ships and Veſſels, as well as the ſame where the fact
was done, and committed, and were and might be without the
reach of his power and authority, or any other, except the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals,
who (if they were in any Ship or Veſſel at an Anchor,
either on the Sea, or on the Haven or Port) by his authority
might call them, and have their teſtimony; or if gone in
any voyage to any forain parts, might by Commſsion have
them examined <hi>ſub mutuo viciſsitudinis obtentu,</hi> and receive their
teſtimony. Now this ſeeing being rightly thus underſtood, the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62625:52"/>
Lord high Admiral of <hi>England</hi> will not ſo ſoon, nor ſo eaſily be
thruſt out of his Juriſdiction upon the Ports, and Havens of the
Sea, by the Coroner of a County, or by the Common Law ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>their,
as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> by that which is deduced and drawn
from this authority, would have him.</p>
               <p>Yet (ſaith Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>) this onely Authority is ſufficient to
over-rule all the ſaid queſtions: For (ſaith he) hereby it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that the Juriſdiction of the Admiral is onely confined by
the Common Law to the high Sea, and affirmeth that it agreeth
with all his former Book-caſes, and Acts of Parliament: For the
Book-caſes, I cannot deny, but that they are much alike, but
all of them together not ſufficient to make a ſufficient proof, for
that which he would have, and againſt that which is denied
him. For its agreeing with the Acts of Parliament, I wonder
he ſhould averre it, ſeeing this very point, even in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
concerning the death of a man upon the Ports, and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
is ſo clean contrary to what the Statute of 15 of <hi>Rich. 2. c.</hi> 3.<note n="l" place="margin">Stat. 15. R 2. c. 3.</note>
in expreſs words ſaith; <hi>de mort de homme &amp; de maheym fitz en groſſes

lieu de meſme les Rivers eſt l'Admiral cogniſſance;</hi> of the death of a man,
and of main done in great Ships, being and hovering in the
main ſtream of great Rivers, only beneath the Bridges of the ſame
Rivers nigh to the Sea, and in no other places of the ſame Rivers,
the Admiral ſhall have cognizance, which is a thing needed not,
nor would have been provided for by this Statute, if a Jury could
have been had out of a proper County for the tryal thereof,
which is a thing requiſite by the Common Law, as in <hi>Lacyes</hi>
Caſe<note n="m" place="margin">Supra cap. eod. May 1. 58.</note> twice already cited upon other occaſions; and as by
Serjeant <hi>Callis</hi> his reading likewiſe in the ſame places. So then
for this particular concerning the death of a man upon a Port or
Haven (which is the foundation of this Argument, that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
ſhould have no Juriſdiction upon the Ports and Havens)
it reſteth onely in queſtion whether the Statute ſhall over-rule
Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> or Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> the Statute, and ancient Law
and Practice of the Admiralty.</p>
               <p>This next thing he urgeth againſt the Admirals having Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
upon the Ports and Havens, is the 43. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.<note n="n" place="margin">43. Ed. 3.</note> which

adjudged parcel of the Abbots Manor, and by conſequence
within the body of the County unto the low-water mark.</p>
               <p>This argument cannot ſo much as ſeem to carry him ſo farre
as he would have gone before; for hereby he pretendeth the
body of the County to reach only unto the low-water mark, and
that only by conſequence, which conſequence will not hold;

ſo it was reſolved, when the Sea doth flow unto the full height,

done upon the water, between the high water mark, and the

And ſo it was adjudged in the ſame Caſe of <hi>Lacy,</hi> that a Felony
done upon the Sea at full Sea, between the high water mark
and low water mark by ordinary and natural courſe of the Sea,
that the Admiral ſhall have Juriſdiction: And ſo when the Sea
returned, the ground may appertain to a Subject, and every thing
done upon the ground when the water is returned, ſhall be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at Common Law, becauſe it is then parcel of a County, and

the Admiral hath the ſole and abſolute Juriſdiction; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

the other upon the Land; ſo it plainly appeareth by what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf

mark to the low water mark, may be ſaid to be within the body
of a Country, when the water is off it, yet is it within the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Admiralty, when the water doth overflow it;
And this will prove no argument at all why the Admiral ſhould
have no Juriſdiction upon the Ports and Havens, but rather an
argument <hi>à fortiori, vel à majori ad minus,</hi> that he ſhall there have
Juriſdiction. For if he ſhall not be excluded from his Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
in thoſe places, where the water recedeth and leaveth dry
land of uſe and profit, which may be claimed by the Lord of a

the water doth never clearly recede, or where no man doth or

of a Ship in the Haven of <hi>Hull</hi> againſt certain perſons: The
Mayor and Bayliffs of <hi>Hull</hi> demanded cognizance by the Charter
of the King granted unto them, that the Citizens and Burgeſſes
of <hi>Hull,</hi> ſhall not be impleaded <hi>alibi de aliquibus tranſgreſsionibus,
conventionibus &amp; contractibus infra Burgum, &amp;c. quam infra Burgum;</hi>
And the cognizance was granted, which proveth that the Haven
of <hi>Hull,</hi> where the Ship did ride, was <hi>infra Burgum de</hi> Hull, and
by conſequence <hi>infra corpus comitatûs,</hi> and determinable by
the Common Law, and not in the Admiralty Court. Which
concluſion no Logician will allow <hi>ex neceſſario</hi> to be deduced out
of the premiſes, <hi>vix ex contingenti;</hi> nor will any Law (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
allow it, that two contending at Law for that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth
to neither of them, though it ſhall be adjudged to one
of them, that this ſhall in any wiſe be prejudicial to a third par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that hath right thereunto, but that he may by the ſame Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the ſame.</p>
               <p>Several Cities and Boroughs, eſpecially upon the Sea Coaſts, do
challenge ſeveral priviledges, ſome by preſcription, and ſome by
grant, as is already ſet forth in this Chapter, as <hi>Flotſon</hi> at <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> &amp;c.
and the Cinque Ports have their Admiralty Juriſdiction <hi>ab antique;</hi>
yet doth not this make their Ports and Havens there to be part of
their Towns, or make them to be within their Boroughs, but
within the compaſs of their priviledges; nay it rather ſheweth
the contrary. For things done upon their Ports, they have their
Admiralty, and do, or ought to proceed according to the Rules
of the Civil and Maritime Laws, <hi>Talem habent Juriſdictionem rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one
Portuum, non ratione alti maris,</hi> and are to give Judgement ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the ſame Law, as the Vice-Admirals of ſeveral
parts do, from which Judgements given in any Port-town, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
the Cinque Ports where the appeal lyeth onely to the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
thereof) an appeal lyeth to the high Court of Admiralty,
as it doth from the Vice-Admirals Court; and for other buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
done within their Town, they proceed according to the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:62625:54"/>
Common Law and they have their ſeveral diſtinct Officers for
buſineſſes of the one nature, and the other, as their water-Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs
for the one, and the land-Baliffs or Serjeants for the other;
and if the Ports and Havens were not within the Juriſdiction of
the Admiralty, I know no uſe that Cinque Ports, or any other;
Ports can have of an Admiralty by themſelves (as abſolutely
and clearly the Cinque-Ports have) ſeeing that the Lord high
Admiral of <hi>England</hi> hath that Juriſdiction of the main Seas, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with all Ports not ſo priviledged. And it cannot be leſs
neceſſary for all the other Ports to have all their buſineſſes agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
therein, tried by the Civil and Maritime Laws, then it is
for the Cinque-Ports.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hull,</hi> no doubt, hath great and large privileges; but whether
they extend unto things done upon the Port or Haven there,
without the authority of the Admiral, I know not: It is like e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
it may, which being made known, the cognizance of
this cauſe might very well be diſmiſt from the cognizance of the
Judges, and left unto the Major and Bailiffs of that Town.
Howſoever take it that the cauſe was diſmiſt only upon that
ground which is here ſet forth, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Citizens and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes
ſhould not be impleaded <hi>alibi in aliquibus tranſgreſsionibus,
conventionibus &amp; contractibus infra Burgum, &amp;c. quàm infra Burgum.</hi>
This no doubt was ſufficient for the Judges of the Common Law
to diſmiſſe the cauſe from being proceeded in before them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
whom it was brought as an Action of Treſpaſs, &amp; not before
the Admiral, &amp;c. for that it rather belonged unto the Major of <hi>Hull,</hi>
then to them, though indeed it perhaps belonged unto neither;
and hereupon the Major <hi>de facto</hi> might take cognizance, though
by no law or right. I hope we ſhall not make the Judgment of evae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Major and Recorder to be a Law, or Preſident that others muſt
be ruled by: For then we may hang up the acceſſary, and go ſeek
the principal afterwards, as they did at <hi>Grantham</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi>
as I have heard. But Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> further ſaith, that the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
was granted, &amp;c. I hope he meant not that it was adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to belong abſolutely unto the Major and Bailiffs of <hi>Hull,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
the intereſt of all other parties: for that had been to have
judged the cauſe <hi>inaudita nec vocatâ parte intereſſe habente.</hi> For the
controverſie was then whether the Judges of the Common Law,
or the Major, &amp;c. had the cognizance of that cauſe; and they
having diſmiſſed it from their cognizance, could grant it no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
to the Major and Bailiffs of <hi>Hull,</hi> but inſomuch, or for
that it belonged not unto their cognizance; ſo that after the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62625:55"/>
diſmiſsion this controverſie was no longer between the Judges
of the Common Law, and the Major of <hi>Hull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> but now the
difference concerning the Juriſdiction of, and over this cauſe,
muſt reſt between the Admiral and the Major and Bailiffs of <hi>Hull,</hi>
for that the Admiral being no party <hi>in fudicio,</hi> the cognizance
could no otherwiſe be granted unto the Major and Bailiffs of
<hi>Hull,</hi> then that they ſhould have it for ought that Court, in which
the Action of Treſpaſs was brought, had to do therewith, or to
hold plea thereof, which could not barre the Admiral of his
claim of Juriſdiction, who was no party in judgement: And
then this only reſteth as an Authority quoted, that ſuch an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was brought at the Common Law; and as it appeareth, that
the ſame was never there determined; ſo doth it not appear that
ever it was therefore determined by the Major and Bayliffs of
<hi>Hull.</hi> But the Major and Bailiffs perceiving an Action to be
brought at the Common Law for a treſpaſs done upon their Pors,
might very well conceive that the Action being there brought,
the ſame was rather tryable before them, by virtue of that clauſe
in their Charter which was urged then by the Judges of the
Common Law; and the Cauſe being diſmiſſed, as it appeareth
not that the Major and Bailiffs determined it: no more doth it
any ways appear, that they did yet by virtue of this Diſmiſsion,
or Grant (as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> termeth it) take upon them ſo much
as the cognizance thereof; or if they did, that the Admiral ever
had notice thereof. But if the Admirall did, or if he did not, yet
if he had taken to his Court the cognizance of this Cauſe, I am
confident that the Major and Bailiffs could no ways by virtue of
that clauſe, or upon any other ground have taken it out of his
hand, unleſs they have Admiralty Juriſdiction granted unto
them, as the Town of <hi>Ipſwich</hi> hath; the ſubſtance of whoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
concerning the ſame, I ſhall here ſet down in confirmation
of what I have ſaid before concerning the Admiralty Juriſdiction
upon the Cinque-Ports and other Ports.</p>

               <p>Now I hope it plainly appeareth hereby that the Admiral hath
full power &amp; juriſdiction upon the Ports and Havens, if he be not
excluded by ſpecial grant, (and that made in the vacancy or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
between one Admirals Patent ceaſing, and anothers begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.)
And if the Port had been within the Borough of <hi>Ipſwich,</hi>
and things there done had been triable at their Town Court, or
at the Common Law, then had they had no need of this Grant
of Admiralty Juriſdiction, &amp;c. by which Grant of Admiralty
Juriſdiction unto them, it doth likewiſe as plainly appear, that
whatſoever is done upon the Port or Haven, is of Admiralty
cognizance, this Admiralty Juriſdiction of theirs extending only
unto their Port and Haven, which reacheth only unto the place
called <hi>Polliſhened alias Poleshead,</hi> and no further, which is the point
of the high Sea, (as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> termeth it) ſo that they have
Admiralty Juriſdiction, and yet none upon the main Sea, but
upon the Port and Haven only. But I ſhall proceed unto the
next thing by Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> inſiſted upon.</p>
               <p>And in the next place it is thus objected, that 7 <hi>R = 2. tit. treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs</hi>
                  <note n="c" place="margin">7 R 2. tit. treſpaſs in Stath. pl. 54.</note> 
                  <hi>in Statham pl.</hi> 54. in an Action of Treſpaſs for a Ship and
certain Merchandizes taken away (which treſpaſs muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
be alleaged in ſome Town and County in ſome River or Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven)
the Defendant pleaded that he did take them <hi>in le haut mere
one les</hi> Normans <hi>quex ſont enemies le Roy,</hi> and it is ruled a good plea,
which concurreth with the other books.</p>
               <p>Here it is not ſaid that this treſpaſs was laid or alleaged to be
done in any Town or County in any River or Haven; but ſaith
he, it muſt of neceſsity be ſo. If he take Town, County, River
and Haven <hi>disjunctim,</hi> then I think that according to the Law the
Action of the Treſpaſs muſt have been laid to have been done
ſomewhere, or elſe the Action would have abated: but if he
take them <hi>conjunctim,</hi> as that it muſt of neceſsity be laid to be done
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:62625:56"/>
in ſome River or Haven, in ſome Town and County, I confeſs
that according to reaſon and nature, a Ship with her lading cannot
be elſewhere, except it be upon the high Seas: But I know that at
the Common Law it is uſuall <hi>per fictionem impoſsibilitatis</hi> (which
neither the Civil Law nor Nature do allow) to lay and alleage
in a Declaration that ſuch a Ship with her Tackle, Furniture,
Ammunition and Lading, was in the poſſeſsion of the Plaintiffs <hi>in
parochia beatae Mariae de Bow in Warda de Cheap,</hi> and thereby him loſt,
and there <hi>per inventionem</hi> came to the hands and poſſeſsion of the
Defendant, &amp;c. and why this Treſpaſs of taking away this Ship
and Merchandizes might not as well be laid to be done in ſome
certain place within ſome certain Town farre enough from the
Port or Haven, I know not: And it is not ſaid, that it was laid
to be done upon a Port or Haven.</p>
               <p>Whereſoever the treſpaſs was laid to be done, in what Town
of what County ſoever (for in ſome Town of ſome County, or
in ſome part of ſome County it muſt be laid to be done) yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all the Inſtances Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> hath brought, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
all that I could ever yet hear of, I never knew or heard
of any original action brought at the Common Law which was
ſaid for a thing done upon any of the Ports or Havens, except that
of <hi>Hull</hi> buſineſs, which never came to be adjudged between the
Admiral and the Mayor, &amp;c. of <hi>Hull,</hi> &amp;c. or whether the action
was rightly inſtituted or not. The defendant pleaded as above,
and it was adjudged for a good plea. I would gladly know what
could be argued from hence, if the truth had been otherwiſe, and
he had pleaded he took the Ship and Goods <hi>infra fluxum &amp; reflux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
maris,</hi> or that he took them in <hi>tali Portu one les</hi> Spaniards <hi>quex
ſont les enimies le Roy,</hi> muſt neceſſarily this plea have been adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
nought, becauſe the other was adjudged good? I ſee not the
conſequence how this concluſion dependeth upon the premiſſes,
if deduced into a Syllogiſm.</p>
               <p>It is objected likewiſe that 7. <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. 32.<note n="d" place="margin">7. H. 6. 32.</note> an action lyeth at
the Common Law for fore-ſtalling, &amp;c. in a Port or Haven, &amp;c.
and by conſequence the Admiral hath no Juriſdiction there.</p>
               <p>Here I do obſerve that about the 6 and 7 year of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. the
then Lord chief Juſtice of the Common-pleas did much endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<hi>ſuam ampliare juriſdictionem;</hi> for about the ſame time the firſt
judgement upon the Statute of the 2 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. for double dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
was given for the pretended breach of the two former
Statutes of the 13 and <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. and this 2 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Admiralty for a thing not done <hi>ſuper altum mare,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62625:57"/>
to thoſe 3 Statutes, whereas none of thoſe 3 Statutes have
one word in them that tendeth to the binding up the Admiral to
the high Seas, unleſs any man can make <hi>ſur le mere ſuper altum ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re;</hi>
nor is there any word in them that tendeth to the making of
the Ports and Havens to be <hi>infra corpus commitatus;</hi>
                  <note n="e" place="margin">Super c. 7. hujus 2. lib.</note> as I have
ſhewed before. By this Judgement double damages were reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
againſt him that had received a loſs of 960 marks, odd
monies; and the damages were aſſeſſed by the Jury to 700 <hi>l.</hi>
which by the Judgement being doubled, amounteth unto 1400 <hi>l.</hi>
ſo that inſtead of recovering of 900 marks without any tryall,
whether due to him or not, he is condemned in 1400 <hi>l.</hi> how the
then Plaintiffe (as the Record is cited) having got the poſſeſsion
of the goods ſued for by the Defendant, formerly the Plaintiffe,
or <hi>pars agens</hi> in the Admiralty, could ſuſtain 700 <hi>l.</hi> damage by
being ſued in the Admiralty, I know not, nor can imagine: For
the Statute doth not ſay, the party ſued in the Admiralty Court
contrary to the Statute of the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
double the value of what he there ſued for, but double
the damage he ſuſtained by ſuch ſuit, which could be no great
matter, unleſs he had recovered and obtained into his poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
the ſumme ſued for, which doth not appear, nor is it ſo
much as alleaged or affirmed.</p>
               <p>Now it could not be expected that ſo much ſea being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into land by this Judgement by two years labour, and but
finiſhed and brought to paſs in the <hi>6th</hi> year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth,
the ſame land ſhould be in the very next year, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>7th</hi> year
of the ſame Kings Reign reconverted into ſea.</p>
               <p>Yet is there a great deal more colour for an Action to lye at
the Common Law for foreſtalling in a Port or Haven, then for
the beforementioned Judgement: but upon another ground
then that which Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> would have to be the ground
(namely because a Port or Haven is within the body of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty)
which is this. Though the foreſtalling be an act done upon
the Port or Haven, yet is it the foreſtalling of a Market, which
is kept at land; ſo that act done upon the Port or Haven hath
relation unto the Market which is at land. And ſo the act done
upon the Port or Haven may be ſaid to ariſe from the Market
which is at land, and within the body of a County, and that act
upon the Port to be a foreſtalling of that Market which is at land:
Juſt as a Contract made at land for tranſporting goods by ſea, is
an act done upon the land, but hath relation to a thing done at
ſea; and ſo the Contract though made at land, is a thing that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62625:57"/>
doth ariſe from a thing done or to be done at ſea, and doth not
ariſe from a thing either done or to be done at land within the
body of any County: And therefore is this Contract tryable in
the Admiralty, and not at the Common Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this agreeth
with the Statute of the fifteenth of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second<note n="f" place="margin">Stat. 15. R. 2. c. 3.</note>, the
Statute being truly examined, which I ſhall plainly ſhew when
I come to ſpeak of Contract. Yet may not this conſtruction of
the foreſtalling upon the water be allowed: for this is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
made for the performance of any act or thing at land poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and therefore ariſeth not from any act or thing to be done
at land, but is a Contract which doth privatively debarre a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
act to be done at land: And beſides this is a compleat act,
having reference to nothing more yet to be done; but the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
is made, the comomodity bought, and all is done; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is this foreſtalling triable in the Admiralty Court, and there
puniſhable, as will hereafter appear by what I ſhall ſhew<note n="g" place="margin">Infra cap.</note> in
ſeveral chapters of this ſecond book.</p>
               <p>In the next place it is objected, that the 19 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 7.<note n="h" place="margin">19. H. 6. 7.</note> it is ſaid
that the Statute doth reſtrain that the Admiral ſhall not hold plea
of any thing riſing within any of the Counties of this Nation,
but Executions he may make upon the land; this Statute which
this Authority citeth, muſt be the ſame before mentioned Statute
of 15 <hi>Ric.</hi> 2.<note n="i" place="margin">15 R. 2. c. 3.</note> therefore I will ſay nothing to this here, more
then that Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> doth hence inferre, that though it be
ſaid in the 22 <hi>aſſ pl.</hi> 93.<note n="k" place="margin">22 aſſ. pl. 93.</note> that every water which flows and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flows
is an arme of the Sea; yet it followeth not (ſaith he) that
the Admiral ſhall have Juriſdiction there, unleſs it be out of
every County, or elſe ſuch a place whereof the Country cannot
take knowledge, as it appeareth in the book of<note n="l" place="margin">Lib. E. 2. praecitat.</note> 
                  <hi>E.</hi> 2. before
cited.</p>
               <p>But how this hath any reference to that of the Statute, to ſerve
for his purpoſe, I know not. The laſt thing againſt that which
is ſaid 22. <hi>aſſ. pl.</hi> 93.<note n="m" place="margin">22. aſſ. pl, 93.</note> he would prove by that of 8 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2.<note n="n" place="margin">8 Ed. 2. praecitat.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cited, which I have anſwered already.</p>
               <p>It is argued out of <hi>Forteſcue, cap. 32. fol.</hi> 38.<note n="o" place="margin">Forteſc. ca. 32. f. 38.</note> that the Admirals
Juriſdiction is confined to the high Sea, for that he there ſaith;
<hi>Nam ſi quae ſuper altum mare extra corpus cujuſlibet comitatus regni illius
fiant, quae poſtmodum in prohibito coram Admirallo</hi> Angliae <hi>deducantur per
teſtes, illa juxta legum</hi> Angliae <hi>ſanctiones terminari debent:</hi> which
(ſaith Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>) proveth by expreſs words, that the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of the Admiral is confined to the high Sea, which is not
within any County of the Realm.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:62625:58"/>
If <hi>Forteſcue</hi> had ſaid much more then here he doth to have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
him a better foundation for his Argument, then this
which he hath ſaid, doth; I ſhould not have much marvelled at
it: For he that conceived that if <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned in Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe,
all the World had been governed by the Common Law,
perhaps might in his time think it meritorious to reduce as much
of the World as he could to the ſubjection of that Law: But
truly out of what he ſaith here, Sir <hi>Edward Cokes</hi> concluſion is
not Logically to be deduced: For to ſay that becauſe <hi>Forteſcue</hi>
ſaith that the Admiral hath Juriſdiction upon the high Sea, which
is out of any County of the Kingdom, that he hath no Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
elſwhere, is no better an Argument, then to ſay that Sir
<hi>Edward Coke</hi> was Lord of the Mannor of <hi>N.</hi> and therefore he
could have no Land elſwhere: For <hi>Forteſcue</hi> doth not ſpeak this
excluſive to any other part of the Admirals Juriſdiction; Nor
by ſaying <hi>Quae ſuper altum mare extra corpus cujuſlibet comitatus regni
illius fiant,</hi> doth he averre, <hi>quod aliquis portus maris eſt infra corpus
alicujus Comitatûs.</hi> If this Anſwer doth not ſatisfie, adde the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to the next Objection to it.</p>
               <p>The next Objection is deduced out of the 2 <hi>Rich. 2. fol.</hi> 12.<note n="p" place="margin">2 R. 2. g. 12.</note>
                  <hi>quod Hibernici ſunt ſub Admirallo Angliae de re facta ſuper altum mare,</hi>
Which (ſaith he) agreeth with the former, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the Admiral is <hi>ſuper altum mare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And no doubt but it is: but it doth not therefore follow that
it is nowhere elſe; Now this very authority ſheweth, the true
uſe and ground of this diſtinction of <hi>ſuper altum mare,</hi> and <hi>ſuper
portum maris,</hi> which is this: The Admiral of <hi>England</hi> hath Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
<hi>ſuper altum mare quo ad Hibernicos, &amp; Hibernici ſunt ſub Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallo
Angliae de re ſacta ſuper altum mare &amp; non ſuper portum Hibernicum
niſi per appellationem.</hi> And ſo it is between <hi>England</hi> and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
adjoyning to the Brittiſh Seas: For the Kings of <hi>England</hi>
have <hi>ab antiquo</hi> had the dominion of thoſe Seas as is ſufficiently
demonſtrated and proved by that learned Gentleman Mr. <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
                  <note n="q" place="margin">
                     <hi>Seld.</hi> Mare clauſum, de do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minio maris per totum.</note> by exceeding many Arguments throughout his whole
Book <hi>de Dominio maris,</hi> called <hi>Mare clauſum</hi> which I have toucht
upon before: but though the King of <hi>England</hi> had the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of thoſe Seas, yet had thoſe Nations Admirals, who had
the Juriſdiction of, and over all buſineſs done in and upon their
own Ports, ſo that the Admiral of <hi>Englands</hi> Juriſdiction <hi>Reſpectu
Regis Angliae Dominii maris</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>ſuper altum mare quo ad alias om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
nationes.</hi> But as had his Power from the King, ſo hath he
Power, Authority and Juriſdiction, as over the Sea, ſo over the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62625:58"/>
Ports and Havens of the Sea, belonging to this Nation, aſwell
as the Admirals of <hi>France</hi> and the Admirals of other Nations
had, and have over the Ports and Havens belonging to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Nations, which undoubtedly they had and have, as hath
been ſhewed before.<note n="r" place="margin">Super l. 1. cap. 2.</note> And upon Letters of reprizal no man
by vertue thereof taketh or ſeiſeth any Ship or Goods within any
foreign Port, or any Port or Chambers of a foreign Prince, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then the Ports and Chambers of that Prince, againſt whoſe
Subjects the ſame were granted. And in ſuch caſes as theſe
which have relation to the Subjects of foreign Princes or States
it is neceſſary to deduce, that ſuch a fact was done <hi>ſuper alto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,
&amp; hoc eſt quoad Portus ſuos:</hi> but in other caſes for Maritime
buſineſſes done either upon the Port or contracted for upon the

done <hi>infra fluxum &amp; refluxum maris,</hi> and in the laſt <hi>infra juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionem
Admirallitatis,</hi> as hath been already ſaid, and ſhall hereafter
be more fully ſhewed.</p>
               <p>For that which followeth in the next place out of <hi>Stamford,</hi> I
joyned it with that of the 8 <hi>Ed.</hi> 2. and have already ſpoken

Power is confined to the high-ſea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Concluſion can no wayes be deduced out of the premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
for though, by the libel in the Admiralty Court the cauſe
was ſuppoſed to commence <hi>ſur le haut mere, &amp; infra Juriſdictionem
de l'Admiralty,</hi> and perhaps falſly ſo ſuggeſted, becauſe the thing
was done in ſome Town within the body of a County: for the
inſtance is, <hi>ubi revera facta fuit in tali loco infra corpus Comitatûs;</hi>
which <hi>locus</hi> may be any in-land Town within any County, and
<hi>non ſuper altum mare,</hi> as it deduced in the libel: For it doth not ſay
<hi>ubi revera facta fuit ſuper tali Portu infra corpus Comitatûs:</hi> If by the
Libel the cauſe had been ſuppoſed to have commenced in, <hi>vel,
ſuper tali Portu infra fluxum &amp; refluxum maris,</hi> then the words of
the Authority might have run thus, <hi>ubi revera facta fuit in tali loco
infra corpus Comitatûs, &amp; non ſuper talem portum, vel infra fluxum &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluxum
maris,</hi> aſwell as <hi>non ſuper altum mare;</hi> for the words, <hi>&amp;


non ſuper altum mare,</hi> are onely in affirmance of the contrary to
what is layed in the Libel, and no ways confining the Admirals
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62625:59"/>
Juriſdiction to the particular place laid in the Libel, ſpecifying
and deſigning that very place where ſuch a particular act was
not done, if ſo be in the Libel it had been laid, that this act had
been done about the mid-way between <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Callis;</hi> and
the Authority had ſaid, <hi>ubi revera facta fuit in tali loco infra corpus
comitatus,</hi> and not in or about the mid-way between <hi>Dover</hi> and
<hi>Callis,</hi> I hope no man will ſay, that by this authority the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
Juriſdiction had been confined to that part of the ſeas that
is about the mid-way between <hi>Dover</hi> and <hi>Callis;</hi> ſo that it is plain
this concluſion cannot be drawn out of the authority.</p>
               <p>The reſt of the Authorities which follow concern Contracts
made at land of things to be done and performed at ſea,
and of things done or contracted beyond the ſeas, which
<note n="u" place="margin">Inf. a lib. 3. c. 2, 3, 4, &amp;c.</note> I ſhall deferre to their proper places.</p>
               <p>There be two things more urged to prove the Admirals Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction

               <p>This followeth next after the premunires, and precedeth next
before the prohibitions by him quoted, that the River of <hi>Thames</hi>

been granted, and conſultations have been awarded, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial

granted upon ſuch ſuggeſtions as could not be maintained, but
deſerved conſultations upon the debate thereof; and ſometimes
the parties have come to an agreement after prohibition granted,
when conſultations would have been awarded if they had been
ſued for, which are ſaid to be Judgements in ſuch Caſes: but a
prohibition is no proof until a diſpute had upon the validity, and
a determination thereupon, no more then the bringing of an
action at the Common Law, and giving a Declaration without
any further proceedings, is a proof that what is by Declaration
claimed, is due, or that the action was duely and legally inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

certainly the Proceedings, Acts, and Judgements given in the
Admiralty Court concerning buſineſſes agitated and done upon
the Ports and Havens will, as preſidents for the Admirals Juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

quoted againſt it.</p>
               <p>The Juriſdiction of the Admiralty, and the Juriſdiction of the

in the proof of this particular, which reſteth in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie
between them, as the practice and preſidents of the
other: But it is like enough ſome will be ready to averre that the
Admiralty Court, is not a Court of Record, and therefore preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of that Court are not of ſo great credit as the Preſidents of
the Courts of Common Law, but it will be very unfit for me to
enter into that diſpute, when as it is upon the matter put to the
queſtion, whether it be ſo much as a Court at all, or not: For
if it ſhall have the cognizance of ſcarce any cauſe at all (as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
have, if all be true that Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> would prove, as I
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62625:60"/>
ſhall ſhew hereafter, when I come to ſumme up all together)
then doth it not deſerve ſo much as the name of a Court.</p>
               <p>This only I ſhall ſay by the way, that when it was a Court,
or if it be a Court, it hath been, and is as much a Court of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord
as all Courts in foreign Nations beyond the ſeas have been,
and are; and whatſoever hath in that Court been, or is done,
being legally tranſmitted and certified, would have carried, and
doth carry along with it as good credit in all parts of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
as any Record whatſoever, certified out of any of the
Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and ſo will and doth at this preſent for any
thing therein tranſacted. But if I ſhould enter upon the preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
in Civil cauſes, which are to be brought out of the Regiſtry
of the Admiralty for the cognizance of cauſes done upon the
Ports and Havens, I ſhould make my ſelf an endleſs piece of
work; and when I have done thoſe things, perhaps may for all
that hath been ſaid, be thought by many not to be authentique:
I ſhall therefore paſs them over, and come to thoſe things which
are as authentique, in my poor judgement, for proof of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals
Juriſdiction upon the Ports and Havens, as any thing that
hath been brought againſt it. And I ſhall begin firſt with the
<hi>Rhodian</hi> and antient Maritime Laws, made, ordained, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the deciſion of Maritime cauſes ariſing and happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as well upon the Ports and Havens, as upon the high Seas,
and then proceed to other proofs.</p>
               <p>By the Laws of the <hi>Rhodes</hi> and other ſea Laws inſerted into the
body of the Civil Law, which give directions how to ſteer the
Judicature of ſo many cauſes, which may happen and fall out
upon Ports and Havens, it manifeſtly appeareth that things there
done, and controverſies thence ariſing, are properly cognizable
by the Admiral, no other Law having the like grounds, or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fording
the like rules for the deciſion of ſuch differences, or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſuch directions for the avoyding of ſtrife in buſineſſes of
that nature: To introduce them all here, would make a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumne,
which I Intend not, and it would be too tedious a labour
to effect that which ſo few regard, namely to ſet forth the moſt
exquiſite excellency of the Civil Law founded upon the very
ſtrength of reaſon it ſelf. But why ſhould I ſo highly commend
that which is ſo much ſcorned, either to be underſtood, or ſo
much as lookt after, and by ſome condemned before it be lookt
into, or at all underſtood what it is? Serjeant <hi>Callis</hi>
                  <note n="f" place="margin">Serjeant Callis Lect. 1. p. 31.</note> condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
the Imperial Law, which (ſaith he) the Civilians uſe; for
that the Sea-ſhoar is therein held to be Common to all, and ſaith
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:62625:61"/>
that the Common Law of <hi>England</hi> doth in reaſon ſurpaſs either
the Imperial Law or the Civil Law; which diſtinction ſheweth
the underſtanding he had in thoſe two Laws, which the world
hitherto made but one. And Sir <hi>Ed. Coke</hi> condemneth the Civil
Law for proceeding by paper proofs (as he calleth them) ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them as if thoſe proofs that were taken without a publique
Notary without the repetition of the Witneſſes before a Judge,
or without the liberty of adminiſtring Interrogatories by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
party at the ſame time, and only expreſt by word of mouth,
and neither ſet down in Paper or Parchment, but paſſeth away
with every ayr, were better taken, and remained more perfect on
record, then thoſe Paper proofs which are in ſuch manner taken,
and with as much care preſerved. But ſurely in moſt controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies
which do ariſe from a thing done upon the Ports and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
it is moſt neceſſary, that the proof for the deciſion thereof,
be taken by ſuch Paper proofs; ſometimes in regard of the ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
return of the Witneſſes into the parts beyond the ſeas, who
cannot ſtay ſuch an examination (without their undoing) as to
be preſent to afford their teſtimony <hi>viva voce</hi> at the time of the
tryall: ſometimes in regard neceſſary and requiſite Witneſſes
are hence departed, before the Suit be inſtituted, and reſided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the ſeas, where their teſtimony muſt neceſſarily be taken
by Commiſſion, which by the manner of proof made at the
Common Law, cannot be done; ſo that moſt differences which
do ariſe from things done upon the Ports and Havens, muſt be
proceeded in according to the rules of the Civil Law, and have
their determination from the ſame, or elſe be decided without
teſtimony, which is to judge blindfold, or elſe to reſt unadjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the wronged and injured party to be left remedileſs and
unrelieved. But it will be anſwered, that in ſuch caſes they may
have a Commiſsion out of the Chancery for that purpoſe: To
which I muſt reply that the Controverſie is whether the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
and tryall of cauſes ariſing from things done upon the
Ports and Havens doth belong to the Common Law, or to the
Civil and Maritime Law. And then ſurely it muſt more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
belong unto that Law and that Court, which can of it ſelf
without the aſsiſtance of any other Court, make a compleat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
and tryall, and give a direct judgement according to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
rules of Juſtice in ſuch cauſes, then to that Court, which
without the aſsiſtance of another Court can do neither. Neither
can the Common Law Courts in very many ſuch cauſes of it ſelf
proceed for want of ſuch Commiſsions; neither hath it in as
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62625:61"/>
many cauſes any expreſs rules to direct the Judicature thereof.

               <p>Thoſe Laws of the <hi>Rhodes</hi> which we find inſerted into the

do treat of the caſting overboard of goods in a ſtorme or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt

and of the Avaridge payable out of the ſame, whether the Ship
be in ſuch ſtreſs of weather upon the Ports or Havens, or upon

the one place as the other.</p>
               <p>Theſe Laws and Rules being general, and not reſtrained to

that by this <hi>Jactus mercium</hi> the Ship and remainder of the Goods
and Merchandizes might be preſerved. And ſuch danger doth
not alwayes fall out upon the high Seas, but oftentimes upon the

the generality of the Sea Laws, which have provided

               <p>Here it is manifeſt by this Law, that if for the lightening of a
laden Ship, becauſe ſhe cannot enter into the River or Port with
her burthen, ſome of the Goods ſhall be put into the Ships
boat, leaſt the Ship ſhould be endangered either without the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
or in the door of the Sea or Port it ſelf, and that Boat
ſhall be drowned, a conſideration is to be had between thoſe
which have their Goods ſaved in the Ship, and thoſe that have
loſt their Goods in the Boat as if there had been a jacture made;
ſo that here we ſee the ſame rule holdeth for the preſervation of a
Ship, as well within the Port or Haven, or the mouth or door
thereof, as for her preſervation upon the high Seas.</p>
               <p>It may be further obſerved out of this Law, that <hi>oſtium maris</hi>
and <hi>portus maris</hi> be both one and the ſame thing: for as <hi>oſtium</hi> is a
door-gate or entrance, ſo is <hi>portus</hi> a Port or Portal, beginning
or entrance of the Sea, or into the Sea; and that <hi>oſtium maris</hi> is
not an imaginary thing between the Sea and the Port or Haven,
as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> would have it to be; for as by ſaying a Port
or Haven, we mean but one and the ſame thing, intimating that
you may take which term you will, as this Law doth in the
beginning by the words <hi>flumen vel portus,</hi> mean one and the
ſame thing, when it ſaith <hi>quia intrare flumen vel portum non potuerit,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62625:63"/>
&amp;c.</hi> ſo doth it in the next place by <hi>oſtium</hi> or <hi>portus</hi> mean one and
the ſame thing likewiſe, when it ſaith <hi>ne periclitetur aut extra flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
aut in ipſo oſtio, vel portu,</hi> the (<hi>aut</hi>) making the disjunctive,
and not the (<hi>vel</hi>) And indeed the whole Port withal its banks
is door ſlender enough for the keeping of the raging waves and
wallowing billows of the Sea from overflowing the Land. And
the banks may properly enough (though they be termed the Sea
banks) be ſaid to be the doors of the land, to keep the Sea out of
it; yet muſt the Haven or Port, wherein the water floweth and
and refloweth, neceſſarily be ſaid and concluded to be the door,
portal or entrance, whereat all Ships and Veſſels whatſoever
muſt neceſſarily enter into the main Sea; and this door of the
Sea is as much a part of the Sea, as a door of an houſe is a part
of that houſe, where it is the door, and doth more properly
belong to the Sea then to the land, whereof it is no part, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
and is diſtinct both in name and nature, being two ſeveral
Elements; and the cauſes ariſing from things done either upon
the high Seas or upon the Ports, being of one and the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
all belonging to Shipping, Navigation, Trading and
Commerce, &amp;c. they are all more properly cognoſcible and try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by one and the ſame Law, then by two, namely by the
Civil and Maritime Laws, then by the Civil Law and the Law
of the land too. For <hi>nulli prorſus audientia praebeatur, qui cauſae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinentiam

Hereby it is plain that the ſpecial Caſes, which are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended

               <p>If one Ship ſhall fall foul upon another, either upon the high

do it upon the Seas, or when the Ship lyeth at Anchor upon any

Laws determine what is to be done herein: Many general
heads more containing under them ſeveral various particulars
might be inſtanced in, but theſe are ſufficient to ſhew that the
Rhodian and Maritime Laws were ordained as well for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of differences happening upon the Ports and Havens,

               <p>What meat the Mariners may carry out of the Ship to land,
how long they may ſtay before they return, what damage hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening
either to the Ship or Goods (being in the Port or Haven)

beſides many other accidents happening in and upon the Ports
and Havens, whith are by them decided: as when a Ship ſhall
by contrary winds, and ſtreſs of weather, be tyred at Sea, ſo that
ſhe is conſtrained to make to a Port not intended, and there is in
want of Victual or Tackle and Furniture, to ſet to Sea again, and
wanteth money wherewith to Victual, Tackle, and furniſh again,
what the Maſter may then do, whether he may pawn or ſell the
Merchants Goods for relief of the Ship, what and how much of
the Goods he may ſo pawn or ſell, when the caſe is that he may ſo
do, and when and upon what occaſion he may ſell the Ship, and
by Law is warranted ſo to do, and when<note n="k" place="margin">Ol. Jud. 21. in aliis l. 20.</note>.</p>
               <p>The ſame Laws do determine what is to be done, in caſe a
man take upon him the office of a Loads-man or Pilot, and by
reaſon thereof undertaketh to bring a Ship ſafe to Anchor in the
Port of her diſcharge, and through his negligence or want of
skill, the Ship be caſt away or periſhed, or the Goods damnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

and in what manner the Maſter of that Ship ſhall be liable<note n="l" place="margin">Ol. Jud. 33. 34. &amp; Jud. 24.</note>.</p>
               <p>Theſe Laws ſet forth likewiſe what is to be done by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of a Ship, when his Ship arriveth in the right Port of her
diſcharge, and hath ſtayed there by the ſpace of one and twenty
days for diſcharge, and is not in that ſpace diſcharged. More
particulars I might inſtance in, out of the ſaid Laws of <hi>Oleron</hi> to
the ſame purpoſe, and how farre the ſaid Laws are extended or
limited by latter writers upon the Civil and Maritime Laws; but
that will be a work more properly to be entred upon, when this
Juriſdiction of the Admiralty ſhall be compleatly ſettled, and
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:62625:66"/>
freed from interruptions in its due procedings: I ſhall therefore
onely ſet down this laſt Judgement, in its own language, not
endeavouring to ſhew what the Law is either in this caſe, or any
of the other before recited, but to conclude that by theſe Laws ſo
long ſince eſtabliſhed for the directions of Judgements in Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
cauſes it plainly appeareth that the Ports and Havens are
within the Juriſdiction of the Admiralty, and that all differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces

before the Ship goeth out of the Haven on her Voyage,

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62625:71"/>
theſe have) for they have neither the ſame method, nor the ſame
diviſion, theſe being divided into 50 Articles, thoſe but into 38.
Yet are not theſe Articles in any one particular contrariant or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant
one unto another; but ſo agreeable in matter of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
that that agreement amongſt them may ſtand for a true
confirmation, and a ſtrong corroboration both of the juſtice, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
and authority they carry along with them, and alſo of the
credit that is to be given to them.</p>
               <p>They all ſo agreeing (as I have ſaid) theſe muſt needs prove
the ſame thing that the others have done, namely the<note n="b" place="margin">Sup. lib. 1. cap.</note> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
Juriſdiction to be upon the Ports and Havens. I ſhall ſet
down ſome few of theſe in their own language, to ſhew this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement,
and ſo paſs to a yet further proof of this particular.</p>
               <p>But I ſhall firſt obſerve that as heretofore<note n="b" place="margin">Sup. lib. 1. cap.</note> I have ſhewed
that the Admirals anciently have had joyned unto their Patents
for that place whereof they were Admirals, a ſpecial Precept to
all Sheriffs, Mayors, Bayliffs, Conſtables, Headboroughs, &amp;c.
commanding them to be obedient unto the Admiral and his
Lieutenants, and to be aiding and aſsiſting unto them when they
ſhould be thereunto required; ſo by the front of theſe Articles or
Statutes the Admiral is directed to grant his Warrant to the Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffs
of the Port (if it be a liberty) as well as to his Marſhall for
the ſummoning of a Jury to make enquiry (according to theſe
Articles) of all ſuch offences as are committed contrary thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
which Articles are there ſaid to concern the Maritime Law;
and theſe are the words of that direction.</p>

               <p>And the penalties of the breach of Articles firſt mentioned
are as theſe are, in caſe the party be convict, and that by expreſs

               </p>
               <p>Whence I gather that which will clearly overthrow the very

grounded, <hi>viz.</hi> that wherean inquiry may be made by Jury, there
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62625:72"/>
the Admiral hath no Juriſdiction, which we plainly ſee is not
ſo.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe Articles with a <hi>nota,</hi> is the ſame with that
which precedeth the firſt mentioned Articles, which is againſt
ſuch as ſhall diſcover the Kings Counſel, or his fellow-Jurats;
and the penalty is the ſame here with that there, which is a very
terrible puniſhment (but I am not about to ſet forth what the
penalty or puniſhment of the breach of every Article is) It is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
for my purpoſe, that the Articles do ſome of them plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhew that the Admiralty Juriſdiction is not limited to the high
Seas, as Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> would have it, and that by this firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
as well as by many more: For certainly whether a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
doth diſcloſe the Kings counſell, or his Fellows either at Sea
or Land, or upon Port or Haven in theſe Maritime matters, it is
inquirable in the Admiralty Court, and there puniſhable; for it
is a ridiculous thing to ſet a penalty or puniſhment different from
all puniſhments of the Common Law (as this is) upon any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
and not to have power to inflict it upon the party ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending,
unleſs he go to the ſea to diſcloſe and diſcover that whch
he hath already done, or might have done at land. And this like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
will check the opinion of thoſe that hold that whatſoever
is done at land, howſoever it concern Maritime affairs, is cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſcible
at the Common Law, and not in the Admiralty: but
of that in its due place. I ſhall here only ſet down (as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore)
ſome few of thoſe Articles, which ſhew the Admiralty Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction
to be upon the Ports, and are agreeable with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
which I have before mentioned.</p>
               <p>The ſixth Article doth enquire of ſuch as have taken up any
Weife, Jetſon, Flotſon, or Lagon out of the Sea, or any great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
and have not ſatisfied the Admiral for his ſhare, this is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable,
though it were Weife, Jetſon, Flotſon, or Lagon in any

the contrary, unleſs we will believe all this was done to no

               <p>And if it ſhall be ſaid that theſe Laws thus digeſted, and
brought into forme and method, have ſince ſuch their reduction
(which was after the time of the twelve hundred years before
mentioned for their being aboliſhed) been again ſuppreſſed,
born down, or aboliſhed, and not received in any forraign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to this day: What ſhall we ſay of the printing and ſo often
reprinting of this large body of the Law, ſince printing was
firſt invented, which was but 190 odd years agone? Next what
ſhall we ſay of the ſo late reprinting this large body with the
gloſs and caſe, and other notes upon the ſame, with the large In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex
thereunto, in all conſiſting of ſix large Volumns in folio,
ſome printed in one Country, and ſome in another; ſome print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
within theſe thirty years, ſome within a ſhorter time?</p>
               <p>Or what ſhall we ſay of the ſeveral Authors of moſt, if not of
all the ſeveral Nations of Chriſtendome, which have in all the
ſeveral Centuries of years ſince the compiling of this body, even
unto this time, wrote and commented upon the ſame, ſome on
one part, ſome on another; and of all thoſe other Authors of all
or moſt ſeveral Nations, which have wrote ſeveral Tractates of
Deciſions and other Law-books, which do ground and raiſe
their authority from this body of the Law, and quote the ſame
for proof of whatſoever they determine?</p>
               <p>Shall we ſay that all this from time to time continued ſtudy,
induſtry, labour and pains hath been taken, and all this coſt,
charge, and vaſt expence laid out to no end, for no uſe or pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe?
or ſhall we ſay all this is done only to mock the world?
Certainly he that ſhall ſay either, will but mock himſelf, and
ſuch as will believe him; but he can never deceive any one that
hath but once ſeen the inſide of a Civilian's ſtudy, either at
home or abroad; for both are the ſame, and furniſhed with books
of the ſame nature and kind; and all Lawyers or practiſers in
the Laws, in all parts of Chriſtendome are Civilians, and do
ſtudy and take their degrees in the Civil Law, as the Civilians
do here, and do proceed in all cauſes for the moſt part according
to the courſe and directions ſet down in the Civil Law, and are
regulated and guided in all their determinations and judgements
by that Law, ſaving that in ſeveral Nations they have ſeveral mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal
Laws, Acts, or Edicts publiſhed, and declared amongſt
themſelves for the regulating their own particular Government,
which are binding unto no others, nor obſervable in any other
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62625:75"/>
Nation, then that wherein they were conſtituted and ordained,
and that in land buſineſſes, and not in maritime and ſea affairs,
wherein ſeveral Nations by reaſon of their Trade and Traffique
eath with other, are concerned, and muſt have their differences
which happen between them determined by one and the ſame
Law, which is principally the Civil Law, though ſome other
Maritime Laws, which receive their ground and foundation
from the ſame, are therewith practiſed; by which all differences
likewiſe happening and ariſing between Nation and Nation, are
to be regulated and determined, it being now generally received
as the Law of Nations, although at the time of its being compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
into a body, <hi>Juſtinian</hi> himſelf diſtinguiſhed it both from that
Law of Nations, and from the Law of Nature. And for other
municipal Laws, one Nation will not ſubject it ſelf unto a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal
Law framed and conſtituted by an other, they being in
ſome ſort different each from other, though both derived from
one and the ſame principal Law, and are neither ſo many as the
Statute Laws of this Land, nor ſo much different from the Civil
Law it ſelf as our Statute Laws are from our ancient fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Common Laws: For indeed the body of the Civil Law be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo ample, large, perfect, and compleat in it ſelf, for deciſion
of all controverſies of what nature ſoever, ariſing between per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of what quality or condition ſoever; The ſeveral munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall
Laws of thoſe ſeveral Countries, are only ſome wayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatory
or explanatory thereof; or ſometimes extending, or
ſometimes limiting the ſame; but ſeldome or never contrariant
or repugnant thereunto, or much differing therefrom; unleſs it
be in the manner of puniſhment, or the like; and ſometimes,
and in ſome places they are no other then the very ſame abrevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
or ſhortned, and made in affirmance of them, and have
their ground from them, as ſome of our Statutes here have
from the Common Law. Nay, thoſe very proceedings, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations

               <p>Nay, the dignity, the precedency, and placing of the Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62625:76"/>
Civil Law, as is plainly ſet forth in the ſaid <hi>Montanus</hi> upon the
Authority of the Parliament of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Boerius</hi> his additions
thereon, who both quote the Civil Law for the ſame; and ſo is
likewiſe the very authority of the Councel from thence derived,
as by the ſaid Authors doth likewiſe appear. And ſhall we now
ſay that this great Court or Councell, and the very order and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
thereof was thus framed and conſtituted by the rules and
directions of the Civil Law, and ſay, conceive or think, that their
judgements and determinations of Controverſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and made, are not according and agreeable to the ſame
Law?</p>
               <p>If I ſhould here endeavour to ſet forth thoſe ſeveral Authors
and Writers upon the Civil Law, which have as I ſaid before, in
the ſeveral Nations of Chriſtendome, in all the ſeveral Ages and
Centuries of years which have been ever ſince the Compiling
that Body, even unto this time, written and commented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and thoſe which have wrote the Deciſions, Determinations,
Judgements, Objections, and other Law books grounded upon
the ſame, and which cite them for their authority and proof of
what they conclude, I ſhould extend this Chapter to a whole
Book or Volumne, and but ſhew the Civilian, and ſuch as have
been verſt in Law Libraries, what they have ſeen already, and but
tell others of thoſe things which they will neither ſearch for, nor
endeavour to ſee: And I am afraid I have too farre already devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
from my intended port of diſcharge of the diſcourſe I in this
book entred upon; which was to prove the Ports and Havens
of the Sea to be within the Juriſdiction of the Admiralty; but
before I can return to ſteer a right courſe thither, it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
firſt to ſhew that the Civil Law is likewiſe neceſſarily pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed,
uſed and exerciſed in all Admiralty Courts, and there bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and of authority to direct the Determinations, Sentences
and Judgements deciſorie in Maritime and Sea affairs, between
party and patty, be they forreigners or others; and then to ſhew
that by thoſe Laws ſo exerciſed and practiſed in thoſe Cours, as
well as by the other Laws already ſet forth, it doth appear that
the Ports and Havens, and all things done thereou are within
the Juriſdiction of the Admiralty.</p>

               <head type="sub">That the Traffique and Sea-trading is different from the
bargaining and trading at land; and that therefore in
all Forreign Natious they have their diſtinct Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
guided by diſtinct Laws, and that though the Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories
for land affairs have in divers Nations divers
Municipal Laws mixed with the Civil Law, yet the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Law is ſtrictly uſed and practiſed in all Admiralty
Courts, and is abſolutely neceſſary in the deciſion of all
Maritime and Sea differences.</head>
               <p>SUch as were apt to believe that the Civil Law was, and is
aboliſhed in all forreign Parts, and no uſe made thereof,
in the rule and governance of land affairs, would very
hardly (without the removal of that miſapprehenſion) have been
perſwaded that the ſame was of any uſe in their Admiraly Courts
in ſea buſineſſes.</p>
               <p>I muſt therefore in the next place ſhew that he which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandeth
only the <hi>Rhodian</hi> Laws, the Laws of <hi>Oleron,</hi> and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions
and Statutes before mentioned (which the Civilian
muſt needs moſt perfectly do, the firſt being a great part thereof
inſerted in the very body of the Civil Law, and the other from
thence derived) cannot without much reading and knowledge
in other parts of that Law, be ſufficiently able to manage the
pleadings and arguing of all Maritime cauſes ariſing in Admiralty
Courts between party and party, and between the ſupreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
and thoſe that are employed by that authority, and ſuch
as are in ſubjection to the ſame, much leſs to judge and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
ſuch cauſes therein according to law and juſtice.</p>
               <p>For Juſtice which ruleth and ſwayeth the ſecular Regimen or
Government of all or moſt Kingdomes and Common-wealths of
Chriſtendome, whereby men are made happy in poſſeſsing and
enjoying their own, and defending themſelves againſt wrongs
and injuries offered by others, hath two wings, <hi>duas volatiles habet
alas,</hi> ſhe hath two wings wherewith ſhe ſoars aloft, and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
her ſelf unto, and ſpreadeth her ſelf over both ſea and land,
ſhe hath two Juriſdictions, the one fitted with Laws moſt apt
and proper for diſtributing of right in all land buſineſſes, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62625:77"/>
furniſhed with Laws moſt meet and convenient for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing
of equity in all maritime and ſea affairs; and yet how
different and diſtinct ſoever theſe two Juriſdictions are each from
other (as I have ſet forth more at large in the<note n="a" place="margin">Sup. lib. 2. cap. 1.</note> firſt chapter of
this ſecond Book) yet do both theſe wings of juſtice in all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Nations ſpring and proceed from one and the ſame body
of the Civil Law, and are from thence furniſhed and fitted with
different and diſtinct Laws, whereby they keep up, and carry ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
upright between them both; and by the one extendeth her
directions unto the buſineſs of the land, and by the other reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
forth her proceed and effects unto the affairs of the ſea.</p>
               <p>Which two wings, if taken off, Juſtice muſt needs fall flat to
the ground, and can by no other means ſo expand her ſelf, as to
extend either her directions unto the one, or reach forth ſuch her
effects unto the other; <hi>Secundis alitibus procedere nequit,</hi> ſhe cannot go
on proſperouſly or happily to execute or performe her own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
office, either upon the one, or upon the other.</p>
               <p>Nay, if either of theſe two wings ſhould be taken off, or but
joynted, implumed, or bereaved of thoſe feathers nature at firſt
gave it, though the other ſhould be preſerved, and kept never ſo
compleat and perfect, yet could Juſtice by the perfection of that
one wing, but hover and heave her ſelf upwards on one ſide,
whilſt the defect in the other would pull her downwards; and
the one ſide falling to the ground, the other muſt neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</p>
               <p>If the power and privileges of either of theſe Juriſdictions
ſhould be decayed, or but impaired, though the other ſhould be
left never ſo entire, yet could not the effects of Juſtice in the one
ſupply the defects in the other: For the Laws of the Land are
no more fit to regulate the Affairs of the Sea, nor the Laws of the
Sea any more apt to rule the buſineſs of the Land, then a horſe is
fit for a ſea Voyage, or a ſhip for a land Journey.</p>
               <p>And then cannot Juſtice be ſaid to be her ſelf, whileſt ſhe ſhall
do right in one thing, and wrong in another; or whileſt ſhe
ſhould render that which is juſt in one matter, when it is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and can afford no help at all in another when it is expected.
Juſtice ſaith <hi>Cicero, eſt habitus animi (communi utilitate ſervatâ) ſuum
cuique tribuens;</hi> Juſtice doth every man right, ſtill preſerving the
common good.</p>
               <p>I will not here ſay how ſlowly Juſtice hath oftentimes put
right forwards, and as it were but ſoared in a circle, by one wings
ſtriving to out-fly the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="tcp:62625:77"/>
But here I will ſay, that he that will make moſt haſte to his
journeys end, and ſetteth his beſt leg forward, if that leg ſhall
not ceaſe to kick the other for making no more haſte, or ſhall
by that or ſuch other means lame it, becauſe it ſelf would get
both the credit and profit of the journey, that leg muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
but hop inſtead of running, or walking, and cannot come
ſo ſoon to its journey's end, if ever it come there.</p>
               <p>And one leg being lamed, if the crutch that ſhould ſupply it,
be applyed unto the other that is not lame, the body will walk
no whit the better; and if one Wing be pluckt, and thoſe Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
imped into, or added unto the other, the Bird will fly no
whit the faſter.</p>
               <p>If one of theſe two Juriſdictions (the two Wings which Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
hath to ſupport her ſelf) ſhould be bereaved of its power
and proper priviledges, though the ſame ſhould be taken and
aſſumed unto the other which enjoyeth all its own before, Juſtice
could proceed no whit more duly, but much more prejudiciouſly
to ſome or other. For as I ſaid before, the Laws of the Sea are ſo
different from the Laws of the Land, that they will not ſerve to
each others purpoſe.</p>
               <p>And indeed they muſt neceſſarily ſo be; for the traffique and
commerce in Maritime affairs by tranſportation at Sea, is in its
own nature as different from the trade of bargaining and chaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
in Land buſineſſes as is the fluid element of water from
the ſolid element of earth: For as the water doth admit of ſome
mixture of the earth, and yet ſtill remaineth water; and the
earth doth admit of ſome mixture of water, and yet remaineth
earth, though not in their abſolute purity, yet in ſuch ſort, as
that the one may properly enough be termed water, and the
other earth.</p>
               <p>In like manner doth the trafficking, and commerce in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing
affairs, admit in ſome ſort of the like covenanting
and contracting as the land Trade and bargaining doth; but yet
remaineth a ſeafaring Traffick, and Commerce, and the land-Trade
and bargaining doth likewiſe in ſome ſort admit of the
like bartering and exchanging of Goods and commodities, as
the Traffiick and Commerce in Merchandizing affairs doth, but
yet remaineth a land bargain.</p>
               <p>In the ſame manner do the Laws, which regulate the one,
and the Laws which rule and diſpoſe the other, admit of ſome
mixture each with other, both in reſpect of their manner of
proceedings to judgement, and ſometimes in regard of their
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:62625:78"/>
concurrency in the Judgement it ſelf, where the nature of the
cauſes differs not; and yet the one remaineth the maritime Law,
or Law of the Sea, and the other the Law of the Land.</p>
               <p>Now if of theſe two different Elements of Water and Earth,
(whereunto I have reſembled the difference between the Traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
and Commerce in Merchandizing affairs by Sea, and the
Laws thereunto belonging, and the land Trade and Laws which
concern the ſame) there ſhould be ſuch an equal mixture, that
the ſame could neither be ſaid to be water nor earth, but a mixt
Body equally compoſed of both, then would the ſame be fit
for neither man nor beaſt to walk or tread on, nor Ship or other
Veſſel to float or ſayl on. In like manner if theſe Laws purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
compoſed for the deciſion of Maritime controverſies, and the
Laws eſtabliſhed for determination of land differences ſhould
be promiſcuouſly applyed to the deciſion, or uſed for the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of both, and by that means ſuch a mixture thereof
made, that the ſame could neither be termed the Laws of the Sea,
nor the Laws of the Land, then would the ſame neither ſerve
for the Government of the one, nor the other. For although
the ſeafaring Commerce and land-trade have ſome reſemblance
(as I have ſaid) in reſpect of the like contracting and bartering;
yet are the Goods and Wares ſo bartered and contracted for, by
way of Merchandizing of various ſorts, and the lading and
ſtowing of them in Ships done, or to be done, after many va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
manners and wayes according to the nature of them, and
many differences there are in the manner of the Maſter of the
Ship, or Skippers acceptance of them, according to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and quality of the Goods ſo received and acknowledged
by his Bills of lading, and ſeverall are the conſignments made
of them, the ſame being ſometimes laden by Factours, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
to their principals for their own proper uſe and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt:
ſometimes for the accompt of their correſpondents, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe much variety and difference is there, in hyring
and taking of Ships, and Veſſels to freight for the tranſportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſuch Goods, Wares and Merchandizes; the Merchants
having ſometimes Ships and Veſſels of their own, which they
ſometimes freight wholly themſelves, ſometimes joyntly with
others: Sometimes the Merchant hyreth or taketh a ſhip, or Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
to freight, which hath ſometimes but one, ſometimes many
owners: Sometimes he taketh her to freight of the owner, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
of the Maſter appointed over her by the owners: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he hyreth her by the Moneth, ſometimes for a whole voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age;
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62625:78"/>
which voyage is ſometimes from one Port unto another,
from that to a ſecond, and ſo to a third, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſometimes
the Ship maketh no Port, but is loſt, or periſhed, ſometimes in
the high Sea, ſometimes in the Port or Haven out of which ſhe
is to ſet ſail, ſometime in the Port or Haven of her diſcharge:
Sometimes She maketh one Port, ſometimes two, ſometimes
more, and yet is caſt away before ſhe come to her laſt Port of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge;
ſometimes in the ſame.</p>
               <p>Sometimes ſuch Goods and Merchandizes are damnified
through the waſtfulneſs of the Maſter, ſometimes of the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
ſometimes through their careleſneſs in ſtowage of them,
ſometimes by reaſon of ill packing or making them up, or put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
ſuch as are liquid in ill or leakie Casks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Sometimes they are damnified by ſtorm or tempeſt, or ſtreſs
of weather, which is ſometimes ſuch, as that the Maſter is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to caſt over board divers of the Goods for preſervation
of the reſt, and ſaving both ſhip and men's lives, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he is conſtrained to cut down the maſts of his Ship, as hath
been<note n="b" place="margin">Suqr. l. 2.</note> ſaid before, in this Second Book. Sometimes they are
damnified in the lading of them, ſometimes in the unlading of
them, ſometimes in the Ship, ſometimes in the Lighter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Sometimes they are damnified by one Ship or Veſſel falling fowl
on another, and that ſometimes by the negligence or careleſneſs
of the Maſter or Mariners of either of them, ſometimes of both;
ſometimes of neither, but through the extreamity of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or through the darkneſs of the ſeaſon, happening either by
miſt, or night, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which could not be helped or prevented by
either the care or diligence of the Maſters, or their Mariners:
Sometimes the Ship by ſuch means is damnnified onely, and
not the Goods: Sometimes the Goods, and not the Ship: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
both Ship and Goods: Sometimes the like falleth out for
want of a Pylot: Sometimes through the ignorance and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfulneſs
of ſuch Pylot, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I might here inſtance in very many more particulars, wherein
this Commerce which conſiſteth in ſhipping and merchandizing
voyages and affairs doth differ from other trades uſed and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
in land buſineſs, thoſe being farre more perillous and
dangerous then theſe, and being likewiſe far more ſubject to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations,
Pyratical robberies and ſpoils then theſe.</p>
               <p>All which differences muſt needs introduce a Law, for the
regulating the various and divers controverſies that muſt needs
ariſe by reaſon thereof, farre different and diſtinct from that
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62625:79"/>
Law, which ruleth and guideth the determinations of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies
and debates which happen in land buſineſſes, not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
to ſuch or the like caſualties, dangers and damages, ariſing
from ſo divers, various and different cauſes, all which do a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter
the very Judgements and determinations according to their
different qualities, reſpects and conditions, which Law (as I
have ſaid before) for the community of Traffick and Commerce,
and holding correſpondency therein, and obtaining the ſame
Juſtice by each Nation from other, muſt continue certain and
unalterable, when as the other may ſuffer alterations, additions
or diminutions.</p>
               <p>It remaineth therefore here to ſhew, that beſides the Laws of
<hi>Oleron,</hi> &amp;c. and the Title <hi>ad legem Rhodiam de jactu</hi> before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
which is inſerted in the Body of the Civil Law, that there
are ſeveral other Titles and Laws incorporated in the ſame Body
proper and peculiar for the Deciſion and Determination of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime
controverſies, which are not at all excerciſed or uſed in
the Deciſion of the differences in land buſineſſes, nor any ways
proper for them, although many of the other Titles and Laws
which are for land buſineſſes are made uſe of in the proceedings,
and ſometimes in the determinations of Maritime cauſes, and
that neither thoſe general Laws which ſerve for both, nor theſe
particular Laws which ſerve for marine cauſes onely, are either
aboliſhed, taken from, or diſuſed in the Admiralty Courts
in foraign parts, but that the ſame are of moſt eſpecial uſe in the
ſame.</p>
               <p>For proof hereof, I might cite the Diſputations, Deciſions,
Determinations and Judgements of divers, and very many, if
not of all and all manner of cauſes, ſet forth in ſeveral Authors,
of ſeveral Nations, in ſeveral ages and times, even to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
age, which are all grounded upon the ſame Laws, and do
cite and quote the ſame for their their foundation, and proof
of what they conclude and determine, as I have ſaid before.
But no man can conceive that this Collection of ſo many Cauſes
out of ſo many ſeveral Volumns, could be contained in one ſo
ſmall as I intended this. And ſome (and thoſe not a few) would
think it a vain and needleſs work to jumble ſo many Authors
together, to no other purpoſe then to confute ſo plain an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
as no man that hath been at all verſt in the proceedings of
foraign judicatures, can be induced to believe.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore inſtance only in ſome few particular Writers
of theſe latter times, of moſt common uſe, and moſt generally

Civil Law, as neceſſarily he muſt do, having not taken in all
thoſe titles which concern the buſineſs, as himſelf confeſſeth in
the very title of his Book, which he ſaith is <hi>Commentaria in omnes
penè Juris Civilis titulos ad rem nauticam pertinentes;</hi> a Commentary
upon almoſt all the Titles of the Civil Law, which concern Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime
Affairs. But indeed they are not near all, if we conſider
the divers particular Lawes which concern the ſame, and are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt
with other Laws under other titles, and ſome titles he
meddleth not with, which wholly concern ſuch matters, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe; nor doth he at all treat upon any other Laws which
concern ſuch affairs, and are made uſe of in all Admiralty Courts
together with the Civil Law.</p>
               <p>Wherefore <hi>Vinius</hi> a learned Civilian of the Low Countries
made an additional Commentary upon the ſame titles of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Law, and upon the Commentary of the ſaid <hi>Peckius,</hi> and ſet
forth the ſame, which was printed at <hi>Leyden</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> in the
year of our Lord God, one thouſand ſix hundred forty ſeven,
wherein he undertaketh, not only to explicate and unfold thoſe
titles of the Civil Law which principally concern Maritime af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
as <hi>Peckius</hi> had done before, but alſo to adjoyn thereunto
the Laws of <hi>Wisbaith,</hi> the Laws of <hi>Oleron,</hi> the Laws ſet forth in the
Book <hi>de Conſulatu maris;</hi> and likewiſe the Maritime Law of the
<hi>Rhodes, Jus navale</hi> Rhodiorum <hi>quod ad finem tomi ſecundi Juris</hi> Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co

               <p>Now although that for the due adminiſtration of Juſtice in an
Admiralty Court, the learning in, and knowledge of the Laws
in theſe laſt mentioned Books be very requiſite, that the ſame
juſtice which one Nation affordeth to another, may be by that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
rendred unto that Nation again, and it obtain the ſame;
yet is the learning and knowledge of the Civil Law, which
guideth and directeth both the Proceedings and Judgments in
all Admiralties of <hi>Europe,</hi> as neceſſary, and farre more requiſite
for him that will juſtifie to any other Nation, or learned Civilian
his due and legal proceedings, and juſtify his Judgments and
Determinations in Maritime cauſes, though according to the
Laws before mentioned. For <hi>Vinius</hi> himſelf in his Epiſtle Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory
to the Conſuls of <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to his ſaid Work praefixed,
(who I doubt not but (in regard that (which he then ſaid in the
behalf of the Civil Law) he ſaid not to any that I now write)
will be believed before me, that may be thought to ſpeak for
my profeſsion in mine own Country) affirmeth that <hi>Peckius</hi> in
his work intended to keep himſelf within the rules of the Civil
or <hi>Roman</hi> Law; yet he did by that work ſhew that he wanted
not the perfection of Learning, or ſolid and ſound knowledge
of Law, and many other things. <hi>Ac for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Now ſeeing that theſe Marine controverſies and differences are
to be adjudged and determined by theſe Civil and Maritime
Laws, certainly then are none ſo fit to heare and decide the ſame,
as thoſe that are well verſt and skilled in theſe Laws, which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
muſt be ſuch as ſpend their whole time, pains, and labour
in the ſtudy thereof, and by that means do better underſtand the
diverſity of ſuch Laws, and gather more knowledge therein then
ſuch as are daily imployed in Forreign affairs, and continually
buſied in multitudes of negotiations, which bring home a golden
Harveſt, which will not be left, or at any time ſet apart to give
way for the ſtudy of thoſe Laws which bring in no ſuch profit.
Such men will rather be found in their Sellars and Ware-houſes
amongſt their rich and precious Commodities, which are to be
bartered and ſold, then in Studies amongſt muſtie Books, that
are to be kept and not parted with; And will rather be ſeen upon
an Exchange, Mart, or Meeting-place of Merchants, then upon
a Bench of Juſtice: And in this my ſaid Author <hi>Vinius</hi> agreeth
with me, who ſaith, <hi>Caetera enim ſcire poſſunt etiam qui vitam umbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilem
colunt, &amp; hi ſi quid literis mandare volunt plura conquirere ſolent, &amp;
curioſiùs cuncta rimari quam aut pragmatici qui rarò relictâ meſſe aureâ,
quàm aſsidua rerum forenſium affert tractatio, literarum monumentis unde
nullus praeventus eſt, ſtudent, aut quilibet alii, quos nimia &amp; circumfuſa ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidet
&amp; opprimit negotiorum multitudo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now ſince I have thus farre deviated and digreſſed from
the way that I was in, give me leave here (in ſo neceſſary a courſe,
or rather diſcourſe) to go a little further, and afterwards get home
again as well as I can. Let me ſhew of what neceſſary uſe the
Civilian is in theſe Admiralty Courts, which have the deciſion
of Maritime Controverſies, and how unfit other men not verſt
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62625:81"/>
or skilled in that Law are for the undertaking thereof.</p>
               <p>I know it will be objected unto me in the firſt place, that ſome
Admiralties in forraign parts are regulated and ruled by the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
and Judicature of Merchants, and other feafaring men well
experienced in matters of that nature.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs I am no Traveller, and that in regard have not
been amongſt theſe Mercatorian and Nauticall Judges; but yet
have I in my ſtudy travelled through the deciſions and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
of many forraign Judicatures, and by that means (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve)
do know their Laws ſomewhat better then they which
have travelled through thoſe Countries, but not through thoſe
Courts.</p>
               <p>And I do finde that where ſuch Mercatorian and Nautical
Judges are, they are either Civilians themſelves, or at leaſt, farre
better verſt in the Civil Law then any of the Merchants or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
of our Nation do ſeem to be; or elſe they are not only
aſsiſted, but regulated and ruled by Civilians, and moreover by
certain Letters yet remaining in my Study, which I have (in that
ſhort time that I have been verſt in the high Court of Admiralty
in <hi>England</hi>) received from ſuch forraign Admiralty Courts, and
the Copies of Letters which were unto them returned in anſwer,
and their replyes thereunto, I can ſhew, that upon conteſt for
the right of Juriſdiction in the cognizance of cauſes, which have
happened between Forraigners and Engliſh, whether the Cauſes
were to be decided by their Court or this, that they have urged
and quoted the Civil Law for the foundation of their Arguments,
for their right of Juriſdiction therein, and have received ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
by anſwers framed out of the ſame Law unto their ſaid
Arguments.</p>
               <p>If I ſhould here ſet forth thoſe Letters and Copies, it would
thereby appear, that the J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>riſdiction of the Admiralty Court of
<hi>England</hi> hath been maintained and defended by Civilians in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manner then the ſame would have been by ſuch Mercatori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
or Nautical Judges, and that the Subject of this Nation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
hath gained that Juſtice and Right at home, which might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe
perhaps have been hazarded abroad.</p>
               <p>But I intend not to ſtuffe or fill up this ſhort Treatiſe (which
I intended ſhould have been farre ſhorter, when I firſt took it in
hand) with Packets of Letters received from ſeveral Forraign
Judicatures, and the anſwers thereunto returned, which will
hardly, or not at all be underſtood by ſuch as are not already
convinced of that which they ſhould be here ſet down to prove.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:62625:81"/>
Nor will I here ſet forth how farre thoſe Mercatorian Courts
(though aſſiſted by Civilians through their over-powering of their
ſaid Aſsiſtants) have fallen ſhort of thoſe which have been
and are wholly regulated and governed by Civilians, as well in
point of proceedings, as in point of the diſtribution of Juſtice.</p>
               <p>But I will here take occaſion to ſet forth ſome inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
not a little deſtructive only to Trade, Traffique and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
and ſo to the Merchant himſelf; but alſo to Shipping and
Navigation it ſelf, which might, and doubtleſs would happen,
if the diciſion and determination of Maritime Cauſes ſhould be
left unto, or ſettled upon Merchants and Owners of Ships to
judge according to their own skill and obſervations, without that
<hi>Jus ſcriptum,</hi> that written Law which paſſeth, is allowed and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed
in all Admiralties of <hi>Europe,</hi> wherein they cannot be
ſo well verſt, as thoſe who have ſpent their whole time in that
ſtudy of ſuch matters as much conduce to the knowledge there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>
               <p>I ſhall but once again put you in mind of what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſaid concerning the neceſsity of upholding one and the
ſame Law in all Nations in Maritime Cauſes, for one Nation's
rendring of the ſame Juſtice to another that it doth from thence
receive, which is the chiefeſt thing that maintaineth the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
of Traffique and Commerce, which cannot poſsibly be
done, if the ſame ſhould be rendred, by the various fancies of
men, in no wiſe guided by any certain forme or rule, but by
that thing (then which nothing can be more uncertain) which
men call opinion; <hi>tot capita, tot ſententiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then I will further ſay, that for the reaſon before ſet down
in this Chapter, the Mariner who cometh in with one good
wind, and goeth out with another, and muſt <hi>opportunè vela ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
applicare,</hi> upon any controverſie or difference ariſing upon or
about the payment of his wages, cannot have ſo ſodain and
quick diſpatch or determination thereof by ſuch Mercatorian or
Nauticall Judges, who have other affairs and buſineſſss to attend,
as by thoſe who make the deciſion and determination of Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
Cauſes their whole work, and attend wholly upon the
ſame every day of the week, both Terme and Vacation.</p>
               <p>Again, it is conſiderable what juſtice the poor Mariner could
expect, or ſhould be like to have, if the determination and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judication
of their wages ſhould be left unto Merchants and
Owners of Ships (as ſome men would have it) out of whoſe
freight the ſame ought to be paid, and would be as it were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62625:82"/>
in all Cauſes of that nature; and if the Cauſe ſhould not at
one time be their own, yet muſt it, and would it aſſuredly be at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
and ſo at all times would it be their own caſe, though not
their own cauſe: and very ſeldome would it be, that it ſhould
not be their own cauſe, there being ſo many Merchants that are
Owners of Ships, and ſo many Owners of every Ship of any bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
conſiderable; and every Part-owner of one Ship for the
moſt part, Owner or Part-owner of more, if not of very many;
ſo that for the moſt part, ſome or other of the Judges themſelves
would be abſolutely concerned in the matter of difference de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
before them, and the poor Mariner left to their good
will and pleaſure for his wages and recompence for his pains im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended,
and his time ſpent in their ſervice, which would be a
means to diſhearten and diſcourage all Mariners for ſerving in
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Bottoms, whenſoever imployment ſhould be offered them
elſewhere.</p>
               <p>Again, in the commixture and joynt Trade of Merchants one
with another, having their complices &amp; copartners in all or moſt
of their trading and merchandizing affairs, and ſuch their tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
and dealing each for other, and in each others name, that it
might, and oftentimes would fall out, that when a man concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
that he had commenced a Suit againſt his adverſary, and
whom he had dealt and traded with, he ſhould in concluſion
find that he had commenced the ſame againſt one or more of his
Judges, that were to judge and determine his Cauſe, or rather the
ſame might fall out ſo to be, and not be at all diſcovered.</p>
               <p>Much more I could ſay to this purpoſe, but I haſten to return
to that which I principally intended to ſet forth in this Chapter,
namely to ſhew by ſome few Authors of very many, that much
of the Civil Law it ſelf is of uſe, and in force in all Admiralty
Courts, as well as any other Maritime Laws.</p>
               <p>And as I laſt inſtanced in <hi>Vinius,</hi> I ſhall in the next place inſtance
in the Authors by him mentioned, namely <hi>Benvenutus Straccha,</hi>
who writeth <hi>de mercaturâ ſive mercatore, de contractibus mercatorum, de
mandatis, de ſponſionibus, de nautis, navibus &amp; navigatione, de navibus ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,
iterumque de navigatione, de conturbatoribus, ſive decoctoribus, quomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
in cauſis mercatorum procedendum ſit, &amp; de adjecto:</hi> Of Merchandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes
and Merchants, and of their Contracts, Mandates, Warrants
and Bargains, or promiſes of Mariners, Ships, and Navigation
joyntly, of Ships ſeverally, and of Navigation by it ſelf, of Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts,

are to be proceeded in, and of Factors or Subſtitutes, &amp;c. which
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62625:82"/>
Book was printed and ſet forth within this laſt Century of years.
And I do earneſtly deſire thoſe that hold the Civil Law uſeleſs
in theſe affairs, and in the Courts deſigned for determination of
differences happening therein, but to look into the before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Book, together with <hi>Grotius de jure Belli &amp; Pacis, Gentilis &amp;
Loccenius,</hi> who are latter Writers, being all eaſily to be had, and
they ſhall find the very Text of the Civil Law, and Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
thereon, not only out of theſe before mentioned ſelected
Titles, but out of divers others, cited and quoted for authority
in all the ſeveral points the ſaid Authors do handle or treat of,
which I hope will be ſufficient to convince any judicious man,
and ſufficiently perſwade him that the Civil Law it ſelf is of moſt
exquiſite uſe in all Admiralty Courts.</p>

               <p>HAving now made it appear that there have been ſeveral

               <p>Now if the Juriſdiction of the Admiralty Courts had been

reſtrained unto the high Seas, where Maſters of Ships and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners
ſeldome or never receive in, or deliver out their Merchants
goods, but upon ſome meer accidental occaſion; and had had
no cognizance of Cauſes happening and falling out upon the
Ports and Havens, where uſually they receive them in, and deliver
them out; then certainly little reaſon had <hi>Peckius</hi> had to have
made this Title to have been the firſt of thoſe ſelect Titles he
gathered out of the body of the Civil Law, for the deciſion of
Marine Cauſes, which belong to the Admiralty Courts; and as

whether the ſaid misfortune happened, either upon the high
Seas, or upon the Ports, Havens, Creeks, or Coaſts of the Sea,
where Ships and other Veſſels do ride, lie at Anchor, or have their
ſtation; and indeed more proper is this Law for the Ports, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
Creeks and Coaſts of the Sea, then for the high Seas, it rarely
or never falling out, that any perſons are preſent to ſteal, take, carry
away, damnifie, conceal, or imbezle any of the goods belonging to
any Ship or Veſſel which ſhall be there wrecked, nor the goods
belonging to any Ship that ſhall be there robbed, or in fight with
an Enemy, but ſuch as are either the Pirats or Enemies themſelves,
neither of which fall under the Judgment of this Law, the one
falling under that Judgment which is proper to Pirats, the other
under that which is proper to an Enemy; and this being not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for the puniſhment of ſuch as are either the Robbers,
Pirats, or Enemies, which ſet upon the Ship, but of ſuch as take
the advantage whilſt ſuch ſtrife and conteſtation is; or when any
wreck doth happen, and when the Maſter and Mariners are in a
diſtraction, do take away the Goods belonging unto their Ship,
which muſt needs moſt commonly fall out, when any ſuch Ship
or Veſſel ſhall happen to be ſo wrecked, robbed, or diſpoiled in
a Port, Haven, Creek, or Coaſt of the Sea, where the Shoar is near,
and the Goods are either caſt upon the ſame, driven thereto, or
with Boats, Engines, or other Inſtruments fetched or brought
thereon.</p>
               <p>And by the two next Laws it more plainly appeareth, that
this Title principally aimeth at ſuch as ſhall offend in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
when a Ship is in her Port or Haven, or upon any Creek
or Coaſt of the Sea, and there doth ſuffer any ſuch diſtreſs, or any
ſuch ſad accident doth befall: for that thoſe Laws take care as
well for the puniſhing ſuch as ſhall take away any of the Goods
from off the Shoar, which ſhall be caſt or driven thereon, as the
puniſhment of thoſe that ſhall take them out of the Ship it ſelf.

               <p>I muſt confeſs that by this laſt obſervation, I have made ſome

this Nation (who pretend not onely many Cuſtoms, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force

and thoſe that hold good correſpondencie, and are in amity with
us, under a pretended cuſtom contrary to all Law, claim and
have the ſame in the like maner, and other cuſtoms likewiſe,

                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:62625:85"/>
To which I anſwer, that by wreck of the Sea, in this Statute
mentioned, is, as I conceive, and under correction, onely
meant and intended ſuch things as are caſt out of the bowels of
the Sea, and by the waves thereof driven on ſhore, and upon
the reflux thereof, left upon the Land, wherein no man hath any
property, or to which, no man can make any claim; this is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
called wreck of the Sea, which belongeth properly to the
King, and by his grant unto the Lord High <hi>Admiral:</hi> But in caſe
any Ship, or other Veſſel, ſhall be wrecked at Sea, or in any
Port, Haven, or Creek, or upon or near any Coaſt, neither the
Ship nor Veſſel, nor any of the Goods thereunto belonging, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
found therein, or found floating upon the water, or dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
on ſhore, or dry land, are wreck of Sea, though the Ship
be uſually ſaid to be a Ship wrecked, and the Goods ſaid to be
wreck, but indeed are <hi>bona ſparſa ex naufragio;</hi> Goods ſcattered
and thrown over board, through ſhip-wreck, or fear or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of ſhip-wreck, wherein the owners of them have a juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
and may make their claim thereunto at any time within
a year and a day, and ought to recover and have the ſame again,
by the Laws of the Sea; and therefore hath that Law exactly
ſet forth, how, and in what maner, ſuch as ſhall either by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
or by ſtealth, or howſoever take, and carry away, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
any ſuch Goods, from the lawful owner, and proprietor
thereof, ought to be puniſhed, and make ſatisfaction for ſuch
their offence committed againſt the Law<note n="t" place="margin">Supra cap. hoc hujus lib. 1.</note>.</p>
               <p>And as that Law doth diſtinguiſh thoſe things, which be <hi>ex
naufragio,</hi> from wreck of the Sea, as plainly it doth; ſo doth it
diſtinguiſh the offence of taking away ſuch Goods, at the very
time of the ſhipwreck, from the offence in ſome time after the
ſame, as is plain by the Laws, before quoted in this Chapter<note n="u" place="margin">F. de incend. ruin. naufr. l. Praetor ait Sect. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Goods: or <hi>Lagon,</hi> that which was found in the bottom of the Sea,

               <p>From which Law many Articles of the Inquiſition taken at
<hi>Quinborow,</hi> and of the ancient <hi>French</hi> Articles, tranſlated into <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>
by <hi>Roughton,</hi> ſet forth to be inquirable in the Admiralty, are
plainly derived: which Articles, and likewiſe many Statutes which
forbid the ſame offences, were enacted to make the ſame more
notorious to the people, and are only in purſuance of this Law,
which is the fountain from whence they flow, as their original.</p>
               <p>Now leſt ſome ſhould ſtill ſtrive againſt the ſtream, and offer
to contend, that this Edict of <hi>Nequid in flumine fiat, &amp;c.</hi> that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſhall be done in any navigable River, or the Banks there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
which may hinder Navigation, or the ſtation or anchorage of
Ships, is meant only of the River which leadeth to the Port or Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of diſcharge, wherein Ships do oftentimes lye at Anchor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they can come further up to be diſcharged in the Port. I
ſhall further clear this point by the Interdict mentioned by <hi>Labeo</hi>
in the <hi>17th</hi> Section of the ſame Law, where the very word <hi>Port</hi>
is uſed: <hi>Nequid in</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">Eod. l. ead. §. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>mare, inve littore, quo portus, ſtatio, iterve navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gio
deterius fiat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After all this perhaps ſome may lauch further out into the
deep, and ſay that although theſe Laws collected out of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Law, are made uſe of in Maritime affairs beyond the Seas, and
do argue their Admiralties to have juriſdiction upon their Ports
and Havens, yet are they of no uſe here, for the Admiralty of
<hi>England</hi> is by the Common Law of <hi>England</hi> more reſtrained, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62625:87"/>
extendeth not unto the Ports, nor hath ſo large a power as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Admiralties have.</p>
               <p>Since ſo many Nations as are named in the Libel ſubſequent
unto the laſt Chapter of the firſt Book of this Maritime Dicaeolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie,
have by the ſame ſo fully acknowledged the Regimen, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
and Juriſdiction over the narrow Seas to belong to
to the Admiralty of <hi>England,</hi> and no other Admiralty, as is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the ſame ſet forth. Let none of this Nation for ſhame ſay
that the power and authority of this Court, which extendeth as
farre, and further then the power of any other Admiralty Courts
doth, ſhall be nothing at or near home. Nor let it for ſhame be
ſaid that our Admiralty, to which they have not only aſcribed,
but preſcribed from ſo antient antiquity, ſuch ſuperiority, ſhall
not afford unto Forreigners the ſame Juſtice other forreign Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralties
afford unto this Nation.</p>
               <p>But for further ſatisfaction to ſuch as will be further curious,
I ſhall proceed to make further proof of this point by Preſidents
out of our own Courts at home.</p>

               <p>I might here take an occaſion to ſet forth a number of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of the Admiralty, both of this time, before it, and ſince,
which would ſet forth the multiplicity of actions entered, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
in, and ſentenced in the Admiralty Court, for Injuries,
Wrongs and Treſpaſſes done upon the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> or ſuch other Ports, that they have been cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
into the Admiralty Court, and there been proceeded againſt,

would appear very many for one of the inſtances ſet down by

               <p>And yet perhaps it may be ſaid, that herein the Admiralty had
uſurped a power which belonged not thereunto; but when as
many inſtances may be ſet againſt one, it is eaſily judged on
which ſide the uſurpation lyeth; But to decide the queſtion
more clearly, I ſhall inſtance in ſome few of many of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law's own Records, which plainly determine this point of
Juriſdiction upon the Ports, and Havens, againſt the inſtances

Now it is plain this was an Action brought in the Admiralty
for, or concerning certain things and injuries done unto the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
within the Juriſdiction of the Admiralty; and the place
which is here ſaid to be within the Juriſdiction of the Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
is a Port or Haven, ſet down in expreſs words, <hi>viz.</hi> the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick

this Action is likewiſe there ſaid to be brought according to due

theſe injuries done upon the River of <hi>Thames,</hi> to be done in the

and maliciouſly to decline the cognizance of the Court
of the Admiralty, and unjuſtly to hinder the due courſe of Law
there: <hi>Cognitionem ejuſdem Curiae noſtrae Admiralitatis in eâ parte frau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulenter
et malitioſè ſatagens declinare et debitum legis praeceſſum ibidem mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus

Writ of <hi>Superſedeas</hi> to be directed to that Court, <hi>breve noſtrum de
ſuperſedendo vobis minus ritè dirigi procuravit.</hi> And that Writ of <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedeas</hi>
is ſaid to have gone out raſhly and unadviſedly, <hi>improvide
emanavit,</hi> becauſe <hi>Lindſey</hi> was juſtly ſued there for things and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries
done and ariſing within the Juriſdiction of the Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<hi>pro rebus &amp; injuiis infra noſtram juriſdictionem Admiralitatis noſtrae

declared, that the Cognizance of the Admiralty Court ſhall not
by ſuch malice and ſuggeſtion be wronged, <hi>Nolentes quod per hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſmodi

to proceed according to law, &amp;c. notwithſtanding the <hi>Superſedeas</hi>
or any other Prohibition directed to the contrary.</p>
               <p>So by theſe Writs <hi>de procedendo</hi> out of the Chancery, the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
is acknowledged to have Juriſdiction upon the Ports and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;
and many more of the ſame nature might be inſtanced in,

               <p>Shortly after the granting of this Conſultation by the Lord
Chief Juſtice <hi>Anderſon,</hi> and before the cauſe could come to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
or to be fully determined in the Admiralty Court, <hi>Prideaux</hi>
upon the ſame Suggeſtion procureth another Prohibition from
the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Popham,</hi> and thereby again ſtayed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
in the Admiralty Court, untill the <hi>41th</hi> year of the
Queen. But in that year <hi>viceſimo ſeptimo die</hi> Junii, upon reexami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the poynt, another Conſulation was awarded agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
with the former; and the Admiralty Court was then a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time ſet free to determine the Cauſe in theſe more expreſs
words: <hi>Ideo vobis mandamus quod praedictus</hi> Patricius <hi>in cauſa praedicta
quoad omnes hujuſmodi res &amp; contractus praedict. ſuper altum mare, vel ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ejus neceſſaria dependentia, Ita quod vos vel praedictus</hi> Patricius <hi>de
aliquibus rebus, contractibus infra corpus alicujus Comitatus regni noſtri</hi>
Angliae <hi>factis ne intromittatis, &amp;c. in Curia Admiralitatis praedictae coram
vobis, ſeu aliquo veſtrum licite procedere &amp; facere valeat, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now here doth this Conſultation put a plain diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the bodies of Counties and the Ports and Havens, here
called <hi>neceſſaria dependentia alti maris;</hi> and indeed they are ſuch
neceſſary dependants of the Sea, that they may very well, nay
they muſt be called <hi>mare,</hi> the Sea, though not <hi>altum mare,</hi> the high
Sea; otherwiſe needleſs, and altogether in vain was this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of <hi>mare &amp; altum mare,</hi> of the Sea, and the high Sea, and main
Sea, if the Ports, Creeks and Havens were not <hi>mare,</hi> Sea, and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:62625:96"/>
thoſe parts of the Sea further remote from the land, <hi>altum mare,</hi>
the high or main Sea. And then let us conſider that though upon
every ſuggeſtion, whereon a Prohibition is in ſuch caſes award<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the Statute of the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, the words
<hi>ſur le meer</hi> in the ſame, be in the Prohibition tranſlated <hi>ſuper altum
mare;</hi> yet will not thoſe words <hi>ſur le meer,</hi> nor any other words in
that Statute bear any ſuch conſtruction (as by the ſaid Statute, if
lookt into,<note place="margin">Inſ. cap. lib. 3.</note> will appear, which Statute ſhall be hereafter ſet down
at large according to the Parliament Roll in the Tower.) And
then is there nothing at all contained in that Statute, which can ſo
much as ſeem to limit the Admiral to the high Seas, or exclude
his Juriſdiction from extending to the Ports, Creeks and Havens,
which are ſea, though not high ſea. And ſo the very foundation
whereon all the Arguments which tend to the deprivation of the
Admiral of his Juriſdiction upon the Ports and Havens are
grounded, is clearly taken away.</p>

               <p>And as before, ſo here in this ſame cauſe, and upon the ſame

               </p>
               <p>But 26 <hi>Maii 41 Eliz.</hi> a Conſultation was again awarded, as in

               <p>Now as by the Writs <hi>de procedendo</hi> awarded out of the high
Court of Chancery, upon <hi>Superſedeas</hi> in the former Chapter ſet
down, ſo by the Conſultations upon Prohibitions awarded out
the Courts of Common Law here ſet forth, I hope it is evident
enough, that the Admirals Juriſdiction extendeth to the Ports
and Havens,<note place="margin">Infra lib. 3. cap. 9.</note> and to all things done thereon. <hi>Vide etiam quae ſunt in

               <head>CHAP. XX.</head>
               <head type="sub">That the Ports, Havens, and Harbours where Ships do lie
or ride at Anchor, are not within the bodies of Counties,
but that the Juriſdiction which the Admiralty hath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
had thereon, hath been by Act of Parliament re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
thereunto.</head>
               <p>NOw ſeeing that the Ports and Havens, whereon Ships
and other Veſſels do ride and lie at Anchor, are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
of a different nature from the land, but are abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſiſting of the ſame nature with the Sea, and are ſometimes
more drawn in, and ſometimes again further ſtretched out; and
are from antiquity both by antient Authors and ancient Records
termed and called the Armes of the Sea, as indeed moſt proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they ſtill are, I cannot eaſily be induced to think that theſe
Ports or Havens, by being only incompaſſed on both ſides with
ſeveral Counties, and touched upon by the banks thereof, can
be ſaid to be within the body of either of thoſe Counties, or ſo
much as the leaſt member, part, or parcel thereof, or ſo much as
properly be ſaid to be within the skirts thereof.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs that many particular Statutes, and new Laws
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62625:97"/>
have been made, directing ſuch and ſuch things to be done or
not done, either by Sea, or upon any Port or Haven, which by
the Civil and Maritime Laws had not been formerly in the ſame
manner, or perhaps not ſo fully directed: And the cognizance
of ſuch matters by the ſame Statutes and Laws, may ſeem to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
unto other Courts, as well as unto the Admiralty, by reaſon
whereof ſome have often reached at all, and have ſtrove to hold
more in one hand then they could graſp in both their armes.
But ſuch things both upon the Sea, and upon the Ports and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
as have been anciently determined by the Admiralty, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Laws Civil and Maritime, have not been by ſuch
Statutes or new Laws really taken therefrom, nor were ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to be: But the ſame have been conſtituted and made in
affirmance of the power and authority of that Court, as wel up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Ports and Havens as upon the high Seas; and have been
by expreſs words continued thereunto, and the cognizance of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
ſuch matters, by ſuch new Laws appointed, have been dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
unto that Court.</p>
               <p>I ſhall inſtance only in one Statute that ſheweth the ſame, and
then leave this ſubject, and breake my ſelf unto another.</p>
               <p>By the Statute of 32 <hi>Hen. 8. cap.</hi> 14. a rate was ſet what ſhould
be paid for the freight or portage of ſeveral particular ſorts of
Merchandizes from the Port of <hi>London</hi> to other places, and from
thence to <hi>London;</hi> and this being a thing mutable, which could
not be formerly ſettled for a perpetual Law, according to any
Rules or Laws Civil or Maritime (though the like had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
done by the Admiralty <hi>pro tempore,</hi> as appeareth by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition
taken at <hi>Quinborow,</hi> and the other Statutes and Articles of
the Admiralty before ſeveral times mentioned) the cognizance of
the exceſsive freight taken for tranſportation of theſe particular
ſorts of Merchandizes, was by the ſame Statute to be taken in the
Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> As for the forfeiture of the double value of
the freight ſo taken, the one half to the King, the other half to
the Informer, yet the exceſsive rates for freight in general taken
for tranſportation of any goods whatſoever, and from and to any
Port or Place whatſoever, having been puniſhable by the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty,
that power is no more taken from that Court by this clauſe,
then the tryal of pyracy, &amp;c. by the Civil and Maritime Laws is
from thence taken by the Statute of <hi>H. 8. 27. cap. 4. &amp; an. 28. cap.</hi>
15. which giveth a power to that Court to try the ſame offences
after another manner, which is a thing by all of both profeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
acknowledged.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:62625:97"/>
Another clauſe there was contained in the ſaid Statute, that if
any Stranger, Denizen, or not Denizen, ſhould lade on board a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Bottom any of their Goods, Wares, and Merchandizes
to be tranſported to any forraign Port, that they ſhould pay no
other Cuſtome or Subſidy therefore, then ſuch as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> paid:
But in caſe that they did laid their ſaid Goods, Wares, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizes
aboard the Ships or Veſſels of Forreigners, then they
ſhould pay ſuch Cuſtome or Subſidy as had been uſually paid
by Forreigners.</p>
               <p>This being a thing newly by that Statute appointed, and not
determined formerly by the Civil and Maritime Laws, whereby
the Admiralty proceedeth; yet was it by the ſame Statute provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that if there ſhould be no ſuch Ships or Veſſels of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
or Dominions of the ſame, at or in the Port, Haven, or Place
where the ſaid Strangers, Aliens, or Denizens, their Servants or
Factors would freight or lade their Wares and Merchandizes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
the outward Regions, that then if the ſaid Stangers or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizens,
their Factors, Atturneys or Servants before he or they did
lade, freight, or convey the ſaid Goods, Wares, Commodities, or
Merchandiſes into any ſtrange Ship or Veſſel, did notify and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the ſame lack or want of ſuch <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ships or Veſſels, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord high Admiral of <hi>England</hi> for the time being, or his

Certificate to be made under his or their Seal to whom ſuch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
or declaration was to be made of lack and want of ſuch <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Ships and Veſſels, that then it ſhould be lawfull for them to
freight and lade their ſaid Wares and Merchandiſes in any ſtrange
Ship or Veſſel, at that time being in the ſame Port or Haven, and
to pay none other Suſidies or Cuſtomes therefore but as the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>

of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And it is enacted by the ſaid Statute, That the Owner and Own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,

as in him or them ſhould be, ſhall provide that all Wares and

freight or portage of Goods and Merchandiſes from the Port of
<hi>London</hi> to other places, and from thence to <hi>London.</hi> I muſt
needs agree with him, that the ſame may, or neceſſarily muſt be
obſolete and out of uſe; for that ſince the time of making of the
ſaid Statute, the rates and prizes for Cables, Anchors, and other
Tackle, Furniture, Victual, and other Proviſions, have been much
altered and encreaſed, nor indeed are, or can the Ships themſelves
either be built or bought at ſuch rates or prizes as they then were,
ſo that they cannot be let for the ſame freight they then were.</p>
               <p>For the other clauſe of Forreigners tranſporting their Wares
and Merchandiſes in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Bottoms, to pay no more Cuſtome
then the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whether the Cuſtomers have diſuſed the ſame,
and ſo made it obſolete, or not, I know not. But in caſe they
have ſo done; I know no warrant or neceſſary cauſe they have
for ſo doing; but for the laſt mentioned clauſe, That Maſters
and owners of Ships ſhall provide, that all the Merchants Wares
and Merchandiſes ſhall be in good order ſaved and kept, and that
the Merchant which ſhall thereby, or by delay or protracting of
the Voyage (without juſt cauſe) longer then the time agreed by
the Charter-party, find himſelf aggrieved, ſhall and may have
his remedy in the Admiralty.</p>
               <p>This is only in affirmance of the Law of that Court,<note place="margin">Sup. cap. 10, 11, 12, 13. hujus lib. 2.</note> and was
both before the making of that Act, and hath been ever ſince u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
and practiſed in that Court, and cannot by the diſuſe of it
at the Common Law (where it is not by that Act at all to be u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed)
be made obſolete, but is by the practice and uſe of it, where
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:62625:98"/>
it is appointed to be uſed, held, continued, and preſerved from
being made obſolete there.</p>
               <p>Now no man can ſay, but that this ſaving and keeping of
Merchants Goods and Merchandiſes honeſtly, and in good order,
is clearly meant of ſuch ſaving and keeping them honeſtly and in
good order, as well whileſt the Ship or Veſſel remaineth in the
Port or Harbour, as when ſhe cometh at high Sea; and the delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and protracting of time in taking of the Voyage with the next
good wind, according to the time agreed on by the Charter-par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
is moſt certainly a wrong or injury done upon the Port or
Haven, and the Juriſdiction of the Admiralty in cauſes of this
nature upon the Ports and Havens by this Statute affirmed and
confirmed.</p>
               <p>And moreover the very breach of the Charter-party, though
made at land, is by this Act affirmed to be cognoſcible in the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty,
which bringeth me in the very next place upon that
point and particular, wherewith I ſhall begin the next Book.</p>

Maritime Affairs ought to be tryed in the Admiralty
Court, and the reaſons thereof.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving been thus long upon the Ports, and Havens,
it is now full time to begin to think of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging
of the Ship, and the delivery out of her
lading to the Merchants, to whom the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth,
and for to come to the Caulking, fitting,
trimming, preparing and furniſhing of her with Victual, Tac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle,
Apparel and furniture, &amp;c. and manning her with Seamen
and Mariners for ſome voyage, and taking in of her lading from
the Merchants or their Factors to be tranſported in the ſame.
In the effecting of all which ſeveral men of ſeveral Occupations,
Trades, and imployments, are ſeverally to be contracted with,
as well at Land, as upon the Port and Haven. The validity and
invalidity of all which contracts, Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> would have
to be Cognoſcible, Tryable, and determinable in the Common
Law Courts, according to the Courſe of the Common Law, and
not in the Admiralty Court, or according to the Proceedings,
Rules, and Grounds of the Civil and Maritime Laws. But I
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:62625:99"/>
muſt here likewiſe adventure another diſpute with him upon this
point.</p>
               <p>And firſt I ſhall offer ſome reaſons to the contrary, and then
endevour an anſwer unto his Arguments. And after both, I
ſhall ſet forth what Laws have been made for the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſuch differences as ſhall ariſe upon ſuch contracts, by
which Laws certainly they are ſtill to be determined.</p>
               <p>And firſt I ſay that by Ships, and Shipping, this Nation is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
and preſerved from foraign Invaſions, and by Trade and
Commerce with foraign Nations not a little enriched; and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Shipping nor Trade, can be upheld without the welfare of
Merchants, Owners of Ships, Fitters, Furniſhers of them, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>And this welfare of the Merchant, Owner, Fitter, Furniſher,
and Mariner, cannot be maintained without a ſettled Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Admiralty, regulated according to the Civil and Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
Laws, ſetled amongſt, and known unto all Maritime Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>Becauſe (as it is well known) all of them have dealings with
ſuch foraign Nations abroad, and ſuch foraign Nations with them
at home, who both expect and will have the ſame Juſtice meted
to them, that they meaſure unto others; elſe will they both for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
to Trade with that Nation, which ſhall deny them that Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
and likewiſe deny that Nation to Trade with them.</p>
               <p>Now it is moſt certain that the municipal Laws of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
are ſo different from the Civil and Maritime Laws, that
if Maritime Cauſes (be they either for freight, wages, dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
done to Merchants Goods, Building, Tackling, and furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing
of Ships, &amp;c.) ſhould be here determined by the munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Laws of this Nation, and beyond the Seas by the Civil and
Maritime Laws, they muſt neceſſarily receive many of them, a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent;
many of them a clean contrary Judgment.</p>
               <p>To inſtance briefly in ſome few of many; If Mariners be hired
to ſerve in a Ship, for ſo much by the Moneth, and ſerve divers
Moneths in her, and the Ship dieth at Sea, and never maketh
port; here the Judgement of theſe two Laws will be clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe, if a Ship be let to freight at a certain rate by the
Moneth from Port to Port, and ſo home again, and the Ship in
ſome of thoſe Ports ſhall be imbarqued for ſome moneths, here
the Judgements of the two Laws both for freight and wages for
thoſe moneths will be contrary, and upon other emergent cauſes
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62625:100"/>
from hence ariſing, the Judgements will likewiſe be, in ſome
farre different, and in other ſome clean contrary.</p>
               <p>If the Merchants Wines, Oyls, &amp;c. be leaked out end for end,
the Judgements upon Action for the freight will be different, if
not contrary.</p>
               <p>If the Merchants Goods ſhall be damnified by ill ſtowage, or
careleſs looking to, or ſhall be purloyned or ſtoln, the party not
known, or if known, not able to make ſatisfaction, here, upon
Action brought by the Owner for his freight, and by the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
for his Wages, the Judgements will differ very much.</p>
               <p>If in a ſtorm at Sea, or in any Port or Haven, the Ship and her
lading be in danger, and ſome Goods be caſt over board, for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the reſt, by the Maritime Laws, the remaining Goods
are to be caſt into an Avaridge, to make ſatisfaction for the Goods
caſt over-board, by which Law certain Rules, as well concerning
the danger, the nature of the ſeveral Goods, and the caſting them
over board, as concerning the Avaridge it ſelf to be made, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed;
which Rules are not known, or owned by the municipal
Laws of this Nation, and therefore cannot that Law take cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
thereof, and conſequently upon Action brought by the
owners for freight whereſoever contracted for, in theſe and divers
other like caſes the Judgement of that Law cannot be agreeable
unto the rules and grounds of the Maritime Laws.</p>
               <p>If a Mariner be hyred by the moneth, and doth ſerve ſeveral
months in the Ship, and afterwards deſert or leave the Ship, and
run away, upon Action brought for his wages, the Judgements
of the two Laws will be clean contrary.</p>
               <p>If the Mariner without leave of the Maſter lie on ſhore, and
the Ship or goods be damnified, or the Voyage protracted; or
if the Ship be not well moored, ſo that for default thereof ſhe be
damnified; or if the Mariner take up clothes, or borrow money
of his fellow, and put the ſame in the Purſers book, upon Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
brought for his wages, the Judgements of the two Laws will
differ.</p>
               <p>If two, be they Merchants, Owners, Mariners, or Furniſhers
of Ships, &amp;c. and thoſe either Engliſh or Foreigners, or the one
Engliſh, and the other a Foreigner, do for Freight, Tackle, or
Furniture of Ships, &amp;c. or by other Commerce in their ſeafaring
buſineſs, become indebted each to other, upon Action brought
by either of them, the Maritime Law admitteth the other to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage
and prove what likewiſe is due to him from him that ſueth
at the ſame time, and alloweth him compenſation, which the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62625:100"/>
Municipal Law alloweth not, but concludeth that ſtoppage is no
payment; by which Law, if exerciſed in buſineſs of this nature,
the abſent might recover much againſt the party preſent, and he
be conſtrained to wait his opportunity, for the recovery of what
is due to him, from him that hath recovered againſt him, to the
leſſening of his Stock, and great hinderance of his Trade: And
in like manner the <hi>Non-ſolvent</hi> might recover much againſt the
<hi>Solvent,</hi> and he nothing at all againſt the <hi>Non-ſolvent,</hi> which would
be very much inconvenient to all ſeatrading men, and a thing not
known abroad.</p>
               <p>Now theſe Maritime Laws for Maritime buſineſſes are all
grounded upon ſtrong reaſons, which if they could be here at
large particularly ſet forth, yet would they not take away the
reaſon whereon the Municipal Laws for Land affairs are ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
in regard different Judgements in different things do ariſe
from different grounds of reaſon: ſo that the Judgements upon
buſineſſes agitated upon the Land may be grounded upon reaſon,
and yet will not that reaſon hold to ground the like Judgement
upon in buſineſs at Sea, or upon the great waters, thoſe being
accommodated with many advantages and helps in their agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and petformance, of which theſe are altogether deſtitute.</p>
               <p>And this will introduce a ſecond reaſon why the welfare of
the Merchants and other ſeafaring men cannot be maintained
without the ſettling and upholding of theſe Maritime Laws, for
deciſion of differences and controverſies in maritime affairs, which
is becauſe theſe Laws are ſuitable thereunto, and compleat to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
all differences in buſineſſes of that nature, which as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
the Municipal Laws of the Land are not.</p>
               <p>For Maritime cauſes, eſpecially thoſe for wages, muſt have a
quick and ſodain diſpatch of Juſtice; the Mariners, as they come
in with one good wind, ſo muſt they ſpeedily go out with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and not wait <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall</hi> Termes, to the loſs of a whole
Voyage, ſuch their imployment being their whole livelyhood.</p>
               <p>Nor muſt they commence every man a Suit according to his
particular contract, to the expence of as much, if not more, then
his wages come to, but muſt as the Martime Laws allow them,
commence their Action in one joint Petition to a Judge at all
times ſettled in a readineſs, and in a conſtant place of Judicature,
where and to whom they may make their preſent addreſſes, for
diſpatch, according to ſuch Laws as they are uſed unto whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they come.</p>
               <p>If the Mariner muſt have ſuch diſpatch againſt the Maſter,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:62625:101"/>
then muſt the Maſter have the like againſt the Merchant for his
freight, out of which he is to pay the wages; and the Merchant the
like againſt the Maſter and Owners of the Ship for damages done
to his goods at ſea; all which is ſpeedily tryed at one and the ſame
time by the maritime Laws, which upon full hearing alloweth
compenſation, and every one hath at firſt his own according to
proof, or confeſsion upon their perſonal anſwers, and no more;
otherwiſe if the Mariners ſhall by ſeveral Tryals at the Common
Law recover their full wages of the Maſter, and be gone, and
then the Merchant recover againſt him likewiſe, or againſt the
Owners of the Ship perhaps as much or more then their freight
amounteth unto, for damage done unto his Goods, perhaps by
the Mariners, who are gone, and not to be met with again, and
be put afterwards to ſue for their freight: this will ſoon cauſe
the owners of Ships to lay their Veſſels by the walls: or if the
Mariners ſhall recover their wages of the Maſters or Owners, and
be gone, and then the Owners ſhall recover their freight againſt
the Merchants, whoſe goods are damnified or ſpoiled by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riners,
and not by default of the Ship, or by default of the Ship,
and not by any neglect or fault of the Mariners, or by both
and he then put to a tryal to recover by Jury the damage he hath
ſuſtained, he is like to have but little or no redreſs. If the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſhall have his diſpatch, and be gone (which he muſt have, or
be undone) and the Merchant wait his Tryal from Terme to
Terme at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ommon Law, then by reaſon of the abſence of
the Mariners, can neither the Owner prove the damage to be
done by meer caſualty, or ſtreſs of weather at ſea; which he is
not lyable to make ſatifaction for; nor can the Merchant prove
the inſufficiency of the Ship, in which caſe the Owner is to make
ſatisfaction, beſides many inconveniences more which might
be reckoned.</p>
               <p>Thus is not the one Law only ſuitable and agreeable to mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
affairs, and the other unſuitable and diſagreeable thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
but the one is likewiſe perfect and compleat for deciding of
all controverſies thence ariſing; the other imperfect, and in no
wiſe compleat for that purpoſe in my judgment.</p>
               <p>For Bills of Bumery, or Bottomry (for many reaſons moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and abſolutely neceſſary in ſea trade) they are likewiſe triable
only by the Maritime Laws, and can be no wayes tryable at the
Common Law, whereſoever made, by reaſon the Ship only is
lyable to payment, which may be arreſted according to the Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
Laws, either at the main Sea; or upon any Creek, Port, or Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62625:101"/>
adjoyning upon the land, which cannot be done by the
Common Law, as I humbly conceive.</p>
               <p>So likewiſe contracts <hi>de nautico foenore, pecunia trajectitia,</hi> or <hi>nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica
uſura,</hi> whereſoever made, are tryable by the Civil and Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
Laws, and not by the Common Law of <hi>England;</hi> and the
Civil Law hath ſeveral Titles concerning theſe particulars, as in
the Digeſts the Title <hi>de nautico foenore</hi> in the Code, the ſame Title in
the Novel Conſtitutions, the Title <hi>de nauticis uſuris, &amp;c.</hi> in which
Titles theſe particulars are defined, what they are, what maketh
them ſo to be, and what maketh them not to be ſo; and are
likewiſe diſtinguiſhed into ſeveral ſorts, each of which is termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
and limited unto its proper bounds, as when this <hi>Nauticum
foenus</hi> is diſtinguiſhed into <hi>Heteroplum</hi> and <hi>Amphoteroplum,</hi> as ſome
Authors terme it; <hi>Heteroplum cum commeatus tantum periculum foene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rator
ſuſcepit; Amphoteroplum cum &amp; commeatus &amp; remeatus periculum
ſuſcepit;</hi> the one when he undertaketh the danger of the Ship on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
outward bound, or only homeward bound; the other when
he undergoeth the danger both of the outward and homeward
Voyage, and many other of the like nature, of which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law hath not one word, that ever I could hear of, much
leſs any rule to guide the profeſſors thereof in the Judgment
of ſuch things.</p>
               <p>In Bills of ſale of Ships, &amp;c. though made at land, the parties to
whom the ſame are made, cannot (if withſtood) obtain the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
thereof, but by the Civil and Maritime Law, and power of
the Admiralty Court. And every Ship that is built may have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
part. Owners, and moſt commonly ſhe hath, and before ſhe
can be compleatly built, tackled, victualled, fitted and prepared
to put to ſea, a great number of ſeveral Tradeſmen muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
have been imployed therein, and been aſsiſting thereunto,
which cannot with any poſsibility, every of them repair to every
Owner, ſome poſſibly being or inhabiting beyond the Seas, other
ſome in this Nation; if all in this Nation, yet oftentimes ſome
in one place, ſome in another, farre remote each from other,
and from the place of ſuch her building, tackling, &amp;c. to make
his particular contract with him for his materials, workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
victual, or other furniture and neceſſaries, ſo that neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
ſome one of the Owners (which commonly hath not above
an eighth, ſixteenth, or two and thirtieth part, and ſometimes one
that hath no part at all) is by the reſt made Mr. of her, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracteth
with all theſe ſeveral Tradeſmen, who regard not his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
by reaſon the Ship it ſelf is by the Maritime Laws lyable for
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62625:102"/>
the payment of every mans particular debt, which Law muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
take place, or elſe few or no Ships be built and employed
for trade; for at the Common Law I conceive they can have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
their ſeveral Actions againſt the Maſter, with whom they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted,
who for the moſt part is not able to make ſatisfaction
to one third part of them, and many times not to one particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
man.</p>
               <p>If one Ship ſhall do damage to another, either at the main Sea,
or upon any Creek, Port, or Haven, the damage muſt be ſued
for in the Admiralty Court, and Judgment given according to
the Maritime Laws, which preſcribeth every Ship her rule, how
to ſteer her courſe both going out to ſea, or coming in from ſea,
or riding at ſea, which plainly demonſtrateth which Ship was in
fault, by which the Judgement muſt be regulated. And no Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
can be ſo properly commenced at the Common Law for theſe
damages, for that the Owners damnified can very hardly arreſt
all the Owners of the other Ship, which did the damage, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
can any of thoſe Owners by that Law be lyable to ſuch arreſt;
but the Maſter, who if <hi>ſolvent,</hi> will not come on ſhore, but take
his imployment in ſome other Ship outward bound, ſo that the
remedy lyeth properly againſt the Ship by the Maritime Laws,
as hath been already ſaid.</p>
               <p>If a contract be made beyond the ſeas concerning any Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
buſineſſes by bill, or otherwiſe, the ſame is not cognizable
at the Common Law by their own books, neither indeed if it
were, could it receive the ſame Judgment it ſhall by the Civil
and Maritime Law; for a verbal Contract is not made by <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumſit</hi>
there, as here it is; nor in a Contract made in writing is
any thing more required, or thought neceſſary then the ſigning
or ſubſcribing of a Bill, for performance, &amp;c. and ſometimes
the ſealing, but never the delivery; nor is there any ſuch ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
there uſed or known, without which by the Common-Law
(as I have heard) it is nothing; ſo that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants, or
other ſeafaring mans Bill, here ſigned, ſealed, and deliveted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the formalities of this Nation in that caſe required,
ſhall, being ſued in any Court beyond the ſeas, prove good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, without due examinations of half the ſaid formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
whereas the Foreigners Bill, which is (according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes
and uſages of thoſe parts, from which they will not by
auy means depart) ſometimes only ſigned, ſometimes ſealed,
ſometimes both, but never delivered, ſhall for want of this one
formality of delivery at the Common Law, prove voyd and of
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62625:102"/>
none effect, and ſo the <hi>Engliſh</hi> man become undone by formali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws, ſo far different from thoſe of foreign
Nations, eſpecially the Laws Maritime, which are for the moſt
part, if not altogether, agreeable in moſt places, if not in all.
Many more reaſons might be given, why all contracts of this
nature whereſoever made, ſhould and ought to be tryed in the
Admiralty Court, by the Civil and Maritime Laws, and not by
the Municipal Laws of this Nation; and many inſtances more
might be given, wherein the Civil and Maritime Laws (which
are Common to all Nations) do differ from the Municipal Laws
of this, and ſo would vary the Judgments in Cauſes of the ſelf
ſame nature: But that is too large a task to undertake here, and
but a needleſs one, when ſome few inſtances may ſatisfy a wiſe
man that intendeth not to quarrel. I ſhall endeavour here in a
word to ſatisfie but one doubt by the way, and ſo proceed (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the beſt of my judgment) to the anſwering the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
brought againſt the Admirals cognizace of theſe Contracts.
It is objected that other Nations have their ſeveral Municipal
Laws as well as <hi>England;</hi> and that therefore theſe Contracts may
as well be tried by the Municipal Laws of this Nation, as by any
Municipal Law of another. I anſwer that they have in ſeveral
Nations, ſeveral different Municipal Laws, whereby they are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
within themſelves, as we are here; yet are thoſe Munici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Laws all grounded upon the Civil Law, and are no more
different one from another, then one and the ſame leſſon playd
upon ſeveral Inſtruments, in ſeveral ſtrains; nor do otherwiſe
differ, then as the ſeveral Interpretations of ſeveral men upon
them have differed; as in many doctrinal points in Divinity va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
conſtructions have been rendred, even upon the very text
of the Divine Law, according to ſeveral apprehenſions and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of ſeveral men.</p>
               <p>For upon all their deciſions and determinations they quote
the Civil Law,<note place="margin">Sup. lib. 2. c.</note> and the Authentique Writers and Commentators
thereon, as is already ſaid, <hi>li. 2. c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as the controverſies happening and ariſing between one
Nation and another, are not to be decided by either of their Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicipal
Laws, that being a way to raiſe a new controverſie, by
which of thoſe Municipal Laws the old ſhould be decided; no
more are thoſe controverſies which do ariſe concerning maritime
and ſea affairs to be determined by thoſe Municipal Laws, but by
their Maritime Laws, by which they trade one Nation with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and which are generally the ſame, and not Municipal, as

within the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> but only with things done upon
the ſea, according to that which hath been duly uſed in the time
of the noble King <hi>Edward,</hi> Grandfather to <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond;
by which, ſaith he, it is manifeſt that the Juriſdiction of the
Admiralty is only confined to things done upon the Sea. And
truly taking only theſe words, it may very well ſeem ſo to be.

               <p>This Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> poſitively without any relation to the
Petition, rendreth in the words before ſet down, <hi>viz.</hi> The Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals
and their Deputies ſhall not meddle from henceforth
with any thing done within the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> but onely
with things done upon the Sea; which <hi>Poulton</hi> more truly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:62625:104"/>
thus; but ſtill without relation to the Petition, that the
Admirals and their Deputies ſhall not meddle from henceforth,
of any thing done within the Realm, but onely of a thing done
upon the Sea; rendring of, for <hi>with,</hi> which is the more proper
ſignification of <hi>de,</hi> and will as I conceive bring home the true
conſtruction of the Anſwer, with relation to the Petition, to
which it hath, and neceſſarily muſt have reference.</p>
               <p>It hath been affirmed unto me by ſome profeſſors of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law, that the King upon a Petition never grants more
then is deſired by the Petition, and that that which is granted more
then is deſired, is void in Law; but that I leave to the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of ſuch as are of their own profeſsion; but the ſame thing
hath been noted unto me as a rule from many expert Record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
more eſpecially from my old deceaſed friend Maſter <hi>W. C.</hi>
not long before his death, then above 80 years of age, <hi>viz.</hi> that
the King in Parliament never granted more then was askt, many
times leſs; who affirmed that this in his younger time he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
for a rule from thoſe that were then ancient. But this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
here being ſet down poſitively alone, without the Petition,
or any relation thereunto, hath (as it ſeemeth to me) made the
Grant far larger then the requeſt, which muſt not be, but muſt
be reduced thereunto, and receive a Conſtruction, with a due
relation to it.</p>
               <p>It being complained of in Parliament that the Admirals and
their Deputies had encroacht, as is before ſet forth; It is deſired
by the Petition that they and their Deputies may not meddle
with Contracts, Covenants, or Regraters, &amp;c. tryable before
the other Judges; It is anſwered that henceforth they ſhall not,
of a thing done within the Realm, but of a thing done upon
the Sea.</p>
               <p>The Conſtruction of the Anſwer, with relation to the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
(which as I humbly conceive muſt not be ſeparated by any
Logician) will plainly be this.</p>
               <p>The Admirals and their Deputies ſhall not henceforth meddle
with any Contracts, Covenants, &amp;c. of, or concerning any thing
done within the Realm, but onely of Contracts, Covenants, &amp;c.
of, or concerning things done upon the Sea: So that we plainly
ſee an Anſwer to a Queſtion, or Petition turned into a poſitive
Theſis, without relation to the thing, whereof it is an anſwer, is
eaſily turned into another ſence never intended; And this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to a Petition, tranſlated alone without the Petition, and put
poſitively, as the tranſlation of the Statute putteth it, doth ſeem
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:62625:104"/>
clearly to take away from the Admiral the Cognizance of all
Contracts, and Covenants whatſoever made within the Realm,
whereas taken with the relation to the Petition, it as clearly
confirms the Cognizance of Contracts of, or concerning things
done at Sea unto him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For as the anſwer to the Petition doth
grant that the Admiral ſhall not meddle with Contracts of things
done within the Realm, ſo doth it reſerve the Contracts and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
of things done upon the Seas unto him; And the words
as I ſaid before, can imply no other thing, to the beſt of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>
               <p>For the following words, <hi>Solonc ce que ad eſtre dument uſe en temps
du noble Roy</hi> Edward <hi>aiel noſtre ſur le Roy quoruſt. Poulton</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
thus tranſlated the Anſwer, without mention of any one
word of the ſubſtance of the Petition) rendreth barely thus: as
it hath been uſed in the time of the noble Prince King <hi>Edward,</hi>
Granfather of our Lord the King that now is: As if this poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Theſis, by him extracted out of that, which was the King's
Anſwer to a Petition, and had onely a relation thereto, had been
ſo uſed in <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds time, whereas the words are a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction
to the anſwer, and bindeth up the Law to what was u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in the Kings time; for <hi>Solonc;</hi> which in true French is <hi>Seloon;</hi>
ſignifieth <hi>ſecundum</hi> or <hi>juxta,</hi> according or agreeable, ſo that if the
Anſwer could be taken poſitively without relation to the Petition
(which as I conceive it cannot be) yet theſe words <hi>Solonc ceque ad
eſtre dument uſe, &amp;c.</hi> had reſtrained and limited it, not to exceed
or extend it ſelf to any thing that was not according or agreeable
to what was duely uſed in <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds time: So that under
correction, by that ſtrained conſtruction and interpretation that is
made of the former part thereof, the Admiral is not barred the
Cognizance either of Contracts, Covenants, or any thing elſe,
which he had Cognizance of in that Kings raign. Take that part
of the Petition wholly, and the King wholly grants it, but no
more.</p>
               <p>By the Petition it is deſired that the Admirals may not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle,
nor encroach upon the Cognizance of Contracts, Covenants,
Regraters, &amp;c. cognizable before the other Judges; the King
granteth it, putting a difference between the Contracts, &amp;c. of
things done at Land, and of things done at Sea, and by this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction
referreth to what Covenants, Contracts, Regraters, &amp;c.
were duly uſed and tryed in the Admiralty in <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds
time, and thoſe he thereunto reſerveth the Cognizance of, but
no other. And now it cometh to be mainly conſidered, whether
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:62625:105"/>
Contracts and Covenants of and concerning Maritime buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
though made at Land, were cognizable in the Admiralty
Court, or at the Common Law in <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds time.</p>
               <p>And it ſeemeth plaine unto me that in <hi>Edward</hi> the thirds time,
the Admiral had the Cognizance of all Maritime Cauſes, by the
words of their Patents. I will give but one inſtance of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
of <hi>Robert Herle,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sup. l. 1. cap. 1.</note> already cited, in which you ſhall

are lyable at the parties Agents choice, though the ſaid Contracts
were made at land; and the like buſineſſes which have their firſt

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, belonging to the ſea, take which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
of the word you will, and the before mentioned cauſes
will be <hi>cauſae maritimae;</hi> if for on the Sea-coaſt, or near the Sea,
then the Contracts in ſuch cauſes, though they he made at land,
are made on the Sea-coaſt, in the Sea Town, or near the Sea:
If for belonging unto the Sea, then theſe Contracts (whereſoever
they are made) are made for things to be agitated and done at
ſea, and for things that cannot be done without the ſea; and ſuch
Contracts they are, that if the ſea was not, would never have been
made; and therefore theſe Contracts muſt neceſſarily belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſea, and ſo muſt thoſe cauſes which ariſe from them; and
muſt as neceſſarily be thoſe <hi>cauſae maritimae,</hi> which the Admiral is
to take cognizance of. And I am confident that it cannot be
ſhewed, that the Common Law had any cognizance of theſe or
the like cauſes in <hi>Edward</hi> the Thirds time; or that theſe or ſuch
like cauſes, were the cauſes wherein the Admirals are ſaid then,
or after, to have encroacht upon the Kings Courts: Nor that
the Common Law had then, nor hath yet any poſitive Laws,
rules, or grounds for the deciſion of cauſes of this nature. And
clear enough it is, that even in <hi>Edward</hi> the Thirds Reign (to
which this Statute hath reference) many Laws and rules were
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:62625:105"/>
confirmed, and many made for direction of the Admiral in the
deciſion of Cauſes of this nature (as by ſeveral antient Records
ſhall hereafter appear) by which I doubt not but that it will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
appear,<note place="margin">Inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theſe Laws thus brought in and thus eſtabliſhed for the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and uſe of the Office of the Admiralty (as its plain they
were by the very words of this Eſtabliſhment, <hi>Et nos Officii Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallitatis

Admiral had not, at, and after the time of the bringing of them
in, or were not at, and after the time of the ſettlement thereof,
to have had the Cognizance of Contracts and Covenants made
at Land, of and concerning Maritime affairs; for many of them
do ſet forth and declare, what Judgement is to be given by the
Admiral upon ſuch Covenants and Contracts; and the very firſt
Judgement ſetteth forth in what caſe the Maſter of a Ship, (being
come to a ſtrange Port) may there ſell the Ship, and in what caſe
he may not, and in what caſe he may pawn ſome of his tackle,
and in what not; all which muſt needs be done by Contract or
Covenant, and he muſt neceſſarily ſeek his Chapman at Land,
and not at Sea. And who ſhould have the Judgement of ſuch
contract, whether it be good, or a void contract, but the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
who hath his direction by theſe Laws, how to Judge, I know
not. The words of the Judgement are theſe.</p>

               <p>Again a Maſter of a Ship hyreth Mariners in the Town where
the Ship is, and by their Agreement, contract or covenant, ſome
are to be at marinage, others at whole pay in mony, which done,
the Ship can find no freight to go to the place where the Maſter
intended to go, and whether he hyred his Mariners, but muſt
go further, or not ſo farre. This no doubt is contracting and
covenanting at Land for a Maritime voyage, which cannot as I
believe be by the common Law, according to the Maritime Rules
decided, nor hath it any rule of it ſelf to Judge it by, whether
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:62625:107"/>
any of the Mariners ſo hired are bound to performe this new
voyage or not, which if the profeſſors thereof ſhall undertake,
I much fear that in this very firſt queſtion they muſt judge clean
contrary to the Laws of the ſea, or clean contrary to the grounds
and principles of their own Law, which are very good and very
reaſonable in the land affairs;<note place="margin">Supr. li. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

Judgement of <hi>Oleron,</hi> and is by other Civil Law Authors amply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,<note place="margin">L Oler. jud. 20.</note>
with expreſs reaſons of every particular. The words of the
Judgment in the Laws of <hi>Oleron</hi> are theſe.</p>

               <p>Other Judgements there be which determine in what caſes
the Maſter of a Ship may ſell part of his Merchants wines, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
goods, without breach of his Charter-party or contract of
a freightment, and in what caſe ſuch his ſale or contract for ſuch
wines or goods (which muſt neceſſarily be made at land) ſhall
be good and ſufficient in law.</p>
               <p>And ſuch caſes as theſe the Admiralty adjudgeth ſometimes at
1, 2, 3, or 4 hours warning, or in a very ſhort time; for if ſuch
Caſes ſhould wait Terms or Courts, many a Voyage would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
be loſt, to the extraordinary great damage both of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
Owners, Maſters, and Mariners of Ships.</p>
               <p>But for Contracts and Covenants between the Maſter of a
Ship and his Mariners; for their wages, ſome have thought them
to be upon ſufferance allowed by the Common Law unto the
Admiralty for the quick diſpatch of Mariners, and they ſhould
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:62625:108"/>
not be inforc'd to bring ſeveral Actions at that Law; but had it
been at the allowance or ſufferance of that Law, another reaſon
might have been added of ſuch their allowance or ſufferance, <hi>viz.</hi>
becauſe theſe poor men ſeldome have any money to expend in
Suit, for obtaining of ſo ſmall a ſumme, as commonly their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
ſeverally amounteth unto, whereas in the Admiralty they are,
and alwayes have been heard ſummarily without payment of
one penny, for the Judges extraordinary pains in the hearing,
and determining cauſes of this nature; and an Advocate expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth
but a ſingle Fee from them all, be they never ſo many, which
oft-times amounteth not to 2 <hi>d.</hi> a piece.</p>
               <p>But we ſee plainly that ſuch manner of Contracts belonged
unto the Admiralty Court by the Law eſtabliſhed and confirmed
in the twelfth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and ſo did all Contracts
and Covenants between Merchants and Maſters, and Owners of
Ships for freight or the like.</p>
               <p>A Maſter of a Ship lets a Ship to freight to one Merchant or
more, and they covenant and agree, that they ſhall ſo lade, that the
Ship may be ready to depart by a certain day, and they fail, and
have not fully laden by that time, ſo that the Maſter loſeth his
time, and oft-times his weathering; this is a Contract or Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
made at land; yet hath the Common Law no law or rule
that, ever I could learn, to judge the ſame by: 1. Whether in
this place the Maſter may contract with any other Merchant for
a new freight, or not. 2. What lading boarded firmeth the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
and holdeth it on, and what freeth it. 3. In caſe the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
be held firme, how many dayes after the terme is expired,
bring the Merchants within the compaſs of the Law to make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.
4. What ſatisfaction is to be made, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
5. How ſuch ſatisfaction being made, the ſame is to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
between the Maſter and the Mariners. And 6. How ſuch
an accident firmeth or altereth the Contract made between the
Maſter and the Mariners. If therefore in Sea affairs there were not
Sea Laws and Rules to limit and regulate ſuch general Contracts,
but that they ſhould be held broken for defect of performance of
every particular circumſtance at the Common Law, very many
and great inconveniences would follow in caſes of this nature,
becauſe as the land is more firme then the ſea, ſo are not land bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſes
ſo ſubject unto various events, as the ſea affairs are, but are
at a farre more certainty for the performance of particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
then the ſea affairs poſsibly can be; and yet it will
not be denyed, but that ſome Contracts made at land concerning
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:62625:108"/>
Land buſineſſes, are againſt the Law, ſome void by Law, and
ſome muſt be regulated by Law, much more muſt ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
Maritime affairs be regulated by ſuch Laws as are moſt
proper for them, which are the Maritime Laws; and if theſe
Laws ſhall not be obſerved and followed in this Land and
Nation,<note place="margin">Super. li. cap.</note> as well as in all others, the Engliſh Merchants, and
the Enhliſh Mariner and Owners of Ships will be tyed to ſuch
inconveniences as the Merchants, Mariners and Owners of
Ships of no other Nation are, to their extraordinary diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage;
but this is but a digreſſion, which hath been ſpoken of
more at large elſewhere, and therefore we will return to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

of Ships and Mariners; ſo doth the 22. Judgement ſet down a
rule, to guide and direct them in the Judgement of Contracts,

I ſhall adde, and here ſet down one Judgement more, which
ſheweth what is to be determined, when the Mariner, or any

Maſters and Mariners parts, which I ſhall not here ſet down, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it is not my drift, or purpoſe to ſhew what the Laws of the
Seas are, but onely to ſhew that by the Laws of <hi>Oleron</hi> eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
in <hi>Edward</hi> the 3. time, Contracts for freight of Ships, and
Mariners wages were cognoſcible in the Admiralty Court, and
theſe Laws are left as guides and rules for the Admirals, and
Judges of the Admiralty to determine ſuch cauſes by.</p>
               <p>Hence it is plain to my underſtanding, that the Statute of <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi>
the 2. though taken in the moſt generall conſtruction,
without reference or relation to the Petition (which I cannot by
any means be drawn or perſwaded to allow) yet being reſtrain'd

whatſoever was cognoſcible before them, in <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3s</hi> time,
and ſo conſequently doth it not take away the Cognizance of
Contracts for freight, nor wages, nor are they any of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments

               <p>IT hath been an antient Rule or Maxime amongſt Merchants,

and Seamen, that <hi>Freight is the Mother of Wages;</hi> therefore
are the Mariners wages to be paid out of the freight the Ship hath
earned; and the damages done to the Merchants goods by the
Mariners, or ſuſtained through their negligence, is to be paid
out of the freight; and what is ſo paid out of the freight, is to be
deducted out of their wages; and by this rule all are neceſſarily
cognoſcible in one and the ſame Court or Judicature; and the

               <p>By the <hi>14th</hi> Article of that Inquiſition, if a Ship be let to
freight for ſeveral prices or rates of affreightment, the whole
freight ſhall be caſt up rateably, and the Mariners paid out of

the lading of their goods, and to cauſe the Mariners to be paid
their wages they had contracted for before their entring into their

               <p>It being plain then that this Inquiſition was in. <hi>Edward</hi> the
Third's time taken for the direction of the Judicature of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty,
it is as plain by theſe Articles, that in his time the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
had cognizance of Contracts made for freight of Ships and
Mariners wages, whereſoever the ſaid Contracts were made; and
then the Statute of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, <hi>cap.</hi> 13. being ſhut up with

<pb n="205" facs="tcp:62625:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which is worthy the obſerving; and then come to ſet forth the
true meaning and ſence thereof, according to my beſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
               <p>And firſt it is by him thus rendred,<note place="margin">Coke li. 2. inſt. cap. 22.</note> That the Court of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
hath no manner of Cognizance, Power nor Juriſdiction
of any manner of Contract, Plea or Querele, or of any other
thing done, riſing within the Bodies of the Counties, either by
Land, or by Water, and alſo of wreck, of the Sea: But all ſuch
manner of Contracts, Pleas and Quereles, and all other things
riſing within the bodies of the Counties, either by Land, or by
Water, as is aforeſaid, and alſo wreck of the Sea, ſhall be try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
termined, diſcuſſed, and remedied by the Laws of the Land,
and not before, nor by the Admiral nor his Lieutenant in no
manner. Nevertheleſs of the death a man, and of mayme done
in great Ships, being and hovering in the main ſtream, in the
great Rivers, onely beneath the points of the ſame Rivers, and
in no other place of the ſame Rivers, the Admirall ſhall have
Cognizance.</p>
               <p>In the ancient Statutes, which were made by way of Petition
and anſwer, <hi>Poulton</hi> in his Collection of Statutes, generally ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
forth the Petition by way of Preface to the body of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
which he deduceth out of the anſwer, which in all Statutes
which concern not one Juriſdiction and another, he hath done
plainly and well enough, in the moſt, and yet not in all.</p>
               <p>The ſame method and order he hath not obſerved in the
Tranſlation of theſe before mentioned Statutes, which concern
the Juriſdiction of the Admiralty, wherein he, or ſome other
whom he hath followed, hath not dealt ſo fairly in my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
as he hath done in the tranſlating and collecting of the
reſt; as may well be obſerved by comparing them with the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals;
he rendreth this Statute thus.</p>
               <p>At the great and grievous complaint of all the Commons
made to our Lord the King, in this preſent Parliament, for that
the Admirals and their Deputies do incroach to them divers Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions,
Franchiſes, and many other profits pertaining to our
Lord the King, and to other Lords, Cities and Burroughs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
thoſe they were wont or ought to have of right, to the
great oppreſsion, and impoveriſhment of all the Commons of
the Land, and hinderance and loſs of the Kings profits, and of
many other Lords, Cities, and Burroughs through the Realm;
It is Declared, Ordained, and eſtabliſhed, that of all manner of
Contracts, Pleas, and Quarrels, and of all other things done,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:62625:112"/>
riſing within the bodies of Counties, as well by land as by water,
and alſo wreck of the ſea, the Admirals Court ſhall have no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of cogniſance, power, nor juriſdiction; but all ſuch manner
of Contracts, Pleas, and Quarells, and other things riſing within
the bodies of Counties, as well by land as by water (as before)
and alſo wreck of the ſea, ſhall be tryed, determined, diſcuſſed
and remedied by the Laws of the land, and not before, nor by
the Admiral, nor by his Lieutenant in any wiſe; nevertheleſs of
the death of a man, and of a maim done in great Ships, being
and hovering in the main ſtream of great Rivers, only beneath
the Bridge of the ſame Rivers nigh to the Sea, and in no other
places of the ſame Rivers, the Admiral ſhall have cogniſance,
and alſo to arreſt Ships in the great Flotes, for the great Voyages
of the King, and of the Realm, ſaving alwayes to the King all
manner of forfeitures and profits thereof coming; and he ſhall
alſo have juriſdiction upon the ſaid Flotes, during the ſaid Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,<note place="margin">Stat. 15 R. 2. cap 3.</note>
only ſaving alwayes to the Lords, Cities and Boroughs their
Liberties and Franchiſes.</p>
               <p>As for the expoſition of this Statute made by Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi>
I ſhall onl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> leave it to be conſidered how it varyeth from <hi>Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons,</hi>
and both vary from the Original, aiming, as I cannot but
believe, at their own ends, when meeting together in ſubſtance,
will, being rightly conſidered, conclude one and the ſelf ſame
thing.</p>
               <p>But having here challenged Mr. <hi>Poulton,</hi> or him whom he hath
followed, that he hath not dealt ſo fairly in the Tranſlation of
theſe Statutes, as he hath in the Tranſlation of the other, I ſhall
here ſhew how, and wherein he hath miſ-tranſlated the ſame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I proceed any further.</p>
               <p>My firſt challenge is, that in the Praeamble to the firſt of theſe
two recited Statutes, he affirmeth that there was a great and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
clamour and complaint,<note place="margin">Stat. 13 R. 2. cap. 5.</note> which had been oftentimes made
before that time, &amp;c. whereas there is mention of no one word
thereof in the Petition, which denoteth any manner of clamour,
but only a modeſt complaint of things done by the Admiralty
Courts, which indeed ought not to have been done, as plainly
appeareth by the Petition it ſelf,<note place="margin">Sup. cap. 2. hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus lib. 3.</note> and the anſwer thereunto ſet
down before: But it is a thing meerly invented in diſgrace of
the Admirals Juriſdiction. And ſecondly, that there is, as I ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
before, left out the whole Prayer of the Petition, both that part
which was granted, and that which was not granted, by which
means he would wreſt and ſet awry, as I conceive, the ſence and
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:62625:112" rendition="simple:additions"/>
meaning of the Statute. Thirdly, that in the Preamble to this
Statute, as in the former, it is ſaid it was made at the great and
grievous complaint of all the Commons, made unto our Lord
the King, &amp;c. whereas there is mention of no one word which
denoteth either great or grievous complaint in the Petition; but
is only inſerted as the other words were in the former Statute.
Other things that were in this Petition, are not ſet forth in the
Praeamble of the Statute, which I ſhall not queſtion, becauſe I do
not find that they were granted, but tacitely denied: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhall proceed to the Petition and Anſwer, as they ſtand in the
Parliament Roll in the Tower, out of which this Statute is dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
And theſe be the words.</p>

               <p>The tranſlations of the fore part of this Statute (the praeamble
excepted) though they do ſomewhat differ one from another,
and both in ſome ſort from the original, yet in matter of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
they may very well be brought to the ſame meaning and
conſtruction. This Statute was made within two years next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that of the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, when the true meaning
thereof rendered with the relation unto the Petition (according
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:62625:113"/>
to the cuſtome of thoſe times when all Statutes were ſo made,
<hi>viz.</hi> by petition unto the King, and his anſwer thereunto) was
not forgotten; and had that of the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second born
that conſtruction Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> hath ſince made of it, the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereon this of the <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second is founded,
need never have, nor ever had been made (I am confident) but
theſe Weſtern Petitioners from whence all theſe Petitions came,
and not from ſo general and common a clamour as <hi>Poulton</hi> makes
it, as plainly appeareth by the Records cited by Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>
in his <hi>22th</hi> chapter of the Juriſdiction of Courts, towards the
end thereof, under this title therein (<hi>Addition of ſome Records
of Parliament</hi>) not being ſatisfied concerning the plain meaning of
the former Act, pray now that the Admirals and their Deputies
may bring into the Parliament their claim of Juriſdiction, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe
and Profits, which they claim to belong unto their Office,
ſo that the declaration of their claim being made in writing in
this preſent Parliament, that may be reſerved unto them, which
ſhall belong unto the ſaid Admiral, and no more; ſo that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this part of the Petition concerning the Admirals giving in
their claim in writing unto the Parliament, was granted or tacit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
denyed; or whether they gave in any ſuch claim or not, doth
not appear, but it doth plainly enough appear unto me, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Petition, a true conſtruction and expoſition of the ſaid
former Statute is made, which is <hi>multò magis contemporanea expoſitio,</hi>
then that expoſition made of it, by the firſt Judgment given after
twenty years at the Common Law againſt the Admirals power
and juriſdiction upon the Ports and Havens, which Sir <hi>Edward
Coke</hi> citeth in his ſaid <hi>22th</hi> chapter of his Juriſdiction of Courts,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Coke</hi> Juriſd. of Courts, <hi>cap.</hi> 22.</note>
and calleth <hi>optima quia contemporanea,</hi> this then muſt therefore be
<hi>melior expoſitio</hi> then his,<note place="margin">Sup. cap. 5. l. 2.</note> and his not <hi>optima,</hi> which Judgement is
more at large handled and treated of before. Now the Expoſition
of that Statute of the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second,<note place="margin">Sup. cap. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus lib. 3.</note> made by this part
of the Statute of the <hi>15th</hi> of the ſame King, is not diſagreeable to
the conſtruction I have made thereof in the ſecond chapter of this
Book, and is, as I conceive, abſolutely in affirmance thereof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo expounded. Which Expoſition, as I have there ſaid before
(being taken with relation to the Petition, and joyning them
both together as they ought to be) rendereth it ſelf thus. The
Admiral ſhall not meddle with any Contracts, Covenants, &amp;c.
of or concerning a thing done within the Roylm. This ſaith
plainly that of all manner of Contracts, Pleas and Quarrels, and
of all other things done, ariſing within the bodies of Counties,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:62625:113"/>
&amp;c. the Admiral ſhall have no manner of cognizance, &amp;c. But
they ſhall be tried, &amp;c. by the Laws of the land, and in this
both Tranſlations in ſubſtance made of this part of this Statute
by <hi>Coke</hi> and <hi>Poulton,</hi> agree with the original, which ſaith <hi>de touts
manners, contracts, plees &amp; quereles, &amp; touts auters choſes ſur dantz deins
les corps de counties, &amp;c. la Court la Admirall eit nulle manner' cogniſance,
&amp;c.</hi> Only here they would both purpoſely pare off (though to
little purpoſe) the letter <hi>a</hi> from the word <hi>ariſing,,</hi> and tranſlate
<hi>ſourdantz, riſing;</hi> ſomewhat to blind the true ſignification, and
make the word that importeth moſt, ſignify little or nothing, or
at leaſt not to be taken notice of: But let it be ariſing, or riſing,
do but take notice of it, and then the Contracts and Covenants
that the Admiral is forbidden to meddle with, are the Contracts
and Covenants of or concerning things done within the Realm,
ſaith the firſt of theſe two Statutes; and Contracts, Pleas, Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels,
and other things done ariſing within the bodies of Counties,
ſaith the other; for ſo ſignifieth the word <hi>ſurdantz.</hi> So that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
and Covenants, &amp;c. of or concerning buſineſſes done at
ſea, the Admiral is not forbidden to deal with, or take cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance
of, nor of Contracts, Covenants, &amp;c. from them ariſing,
no nor of things done within the bodies of Counties, which
have relation to the Sea, or to Navigation, or do from thence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe,
is the Admiral forbidden the cognizance, but hath full pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and juriſdiction over the ſame, not at all in my apprehenſion
reſtrained by either of theſe two Statutes.</p>
               <p>Now Charter parties, or other Contracts for freight or wages,
tackling, furniſhing, or victualling of Ships, &amp;c. cannot be ſaid
to be Contracts, or Covenants of or concerning things done
within the Realm, or ariſing from things done, or to be done
within the bodies of Counties, though they be there made, but
are Contracts, or Covenants of, or concerning Maritime buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes,
done, or to be done at Sea, and ariſing from ſuch things,
as are there done, or to be done, which be the <hi>finales cauſae</hi> of ſuch
Contracts, from whence all actions, or motions do ariſe; <hi>à fine
omnis oritur actio;</hi> It is <hi>cauſa cauſarum &amp; impellit efficientem ad agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,
&amp; praeſcribit deſtinatis ordinem ad agendum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Tranſportation of men, Merchandizes, Wares and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
of all ſorts, from one Kingdom or Nation to another,
or from one Port to another by Sea (a thing not to be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Realm, or within the body of a County) is the <hi>finis,</hi> or <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis
cauſa,</hi> from whence all Contracts; or Covenants, for freight,
wages, tackling, furniſhing, and victualling of Ships do ariſe;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:62625:114"/>
ſuch Contracts and Covenants are therefore by theſe very Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
in my opinion, cognoſcible and tryable in the Admiralty
Court, and no where elſe.</p>
               <p>If Bargains, Contracts, or Covenants for Land, Houſes, Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
Money, or other Land Commodities, be made upon the
high Sea, and the Deeds, Bonds, Bills, or other Writings be
there ſigned, ſealed and delivered, here the Conſtruction of both
the Statutes will be, that though the Bargains, Contracts, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants,
&amp;c. were made at Sea, yet they were of, and concerning
things done, or to be done at Land, within the bodies of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and ſo cognoſcible and tryable by the Law of the Land,
which is true enough; and then certainly in Contracts and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
made at Land of, or concerning things done, or to done at
Sea, or ariſing from things there done, or to be there done, the
ſame Statutes ought to be afforded the ſame Conſtruction and
Interpretation.</p>
               <p>And had not this word <hi>Surdantz</hi> ariſing, cleared this Conſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
upon this Statute, yet would the Law it ſelf have avoided
that Conſtruction which hath been made of the other. For as
in Land affairs, by Law every man is to be underſtood, to have
contracted in that place, where that which is contracted for, is to
be performed; So in Sea affairs doth the ſame Law and Rule hold;

               <p>The Maſter or Owner of a Ship doth Contract with the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant,
for ſo much freight by the moneth, to tranſport his wares
and merchandiſes by Sea; This contract is to be underſtood by
Law to have been made at Sea, where the Ship ſerved, and where
ſo much money for ſo many moneths grew due; and the gloſs
upon the before cyted Law, ſaith, <hi>Cum eſſem</hi> Bononiae, <hi>promiſi tibi
dare centum in Civitate</hi> Mutinae, <hi>&amp; de hoc factus eſt contractus</hi> Bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niae,
<hi>dicitur quod poſſum conveniri</hi> Mutinae <hi>ad illa centum, quaſi ibi vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear

               </p>
               <p>When I am at <hi>Bononia</hi> I promiſe to give you 100, at the City
of <hi>Mutina,</hi> and hereof a Contract is made at <hi>Bononia,</hi> yet may I
be convented at <hi>Mutina</hi> for this 100, as if I ſeemed there to have
contracted, ſo that I am ſubject to the Juriſdiction of that City.
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:62625:114"/>
So having contracted at <hi>London</hi> to tranſport any thing at, or by
Sea, at a certain rate by the moneth, I am ſubject to the Maritime
and Sea Juriſdiction. But it may be objected that <hi>fictio juris</hi> is
allowed in all Laws, and although a man be bound to pay mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
at one place, he may be ſued at another, and ſo a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
bound to tranſport goods, or perform any other duty, or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
at one place, yet he may <hi>per fictionem juris</hi> be fained or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
to have been bound to perform the ſame elſewhere, and ſo
be ſued elſewhere. <hi>Sol.</hi> I anſwer that it is true, if my fiction be
of a thing poſſible, it may be allowed, as if I be bound to pay
money at <hi>London,</hi> I may be ſued at <hi>York,</hi> becauſe it is poſſible I
might have been bound to have paid it there; But if my fiction
be of a thing impoſsible, it may not be allowed (for impoſsibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
nature abhorreth) as if I bind my ſelf to tranſport a
Merchants Goods, to ſome Port beyond the Seas, it is impoſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
I ſhould do it by Land; ſuch a fiction, therefore that I have
done it by Land, is not to be allowed; nor am I for non perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance
ſubject to any land Juriſdiction. Out of the grounds of
this Argument might be deduced a far larger debate, which by
reaſon of the many differences between the Civil and Common
Law in this point, would be too tedious; I ſhall therefore inſiſt
no longer thereupon, but come to the latter part of this Statute,
<hi>viz. Nevertheleſs of the death of a man, and a maihme, &amp;c.</hi> which had
been more properly inſerted amongſt the particulars which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
the Admirals Juriſdiction upon the Ports and Havens; but
being here by Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> enforced all together, I cannot here
let it paſs without the obſervation due unto it. He, as I ſhewed
before,<note place="margin">Sup. hoc. cap.</note> in this chapter rendereth this part of the Statute thus:
<hi>Nevertheleſs of the death of man, and a maihme done in great Ships, being
and hovering in the main ſtream of great Rivers, only beneath the points of the
ſame Rivers, and in no other place of the ſame Rivers the Admiral ſhall have
cognizance;</hi> excluding him from his power of the death of a man,
and a maihme, &amp;c. of arreſting Ships in the great Flotes for the
great Voyages of the King, or of the Realm, within the Ports and
Havens,<note place="margin">Sup. hoc. cap.</note> which both the original Statute, and <hi>Poulton</hi>'s Tranſlati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
alloweth him, as appeareth by what is already ſet down in
this Chapter. And this only cogniſance of the death of a man,
and a maihme (by this his rendring of the Statute) he will allow
the Admiral only beneath the points of theſe great Rivers, which
the original ſetteth down <hi>Pontz,</hi> and <hi>Poulton's</hi> Tranſlation rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
Bridges.</p>
               <p>All that is beneath the points of great Rivers (it is well known,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:62625:115"/>
and hath always been accompted the main Sea; ſo that by this
conſtruction of this part of the Statute, he hath limited the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirals
Juriſdiction to the death of a man only, and a maihme,
and arreſting of great Ships, &amp;c. and that upon the main Sea on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and will not allow him either Contracts or Covenants made
at land, of, or for buſineſſes there done, nor the cognizance of
any thing done upon the Havens; but howſoever after this his
conſtruction of this word, he preſently with one and the ſame
breath, ſomewhat contradicts himſelf; for in his very expoſition
of this clauſe, he ſaith thus: This latter clauſe giveth the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral
juriſdiction in caſe of death and maihme (with neither of
which we ever meddle) but with all other things happening
within the <hi>Thames,</hi> or any other River, Port, or Water, which are
within any County of the Realm, ſo that the cogniſance of this
death and maihme, which before was allowed the Admiral only
beneath the points, is now acknowledged never to have been
meddled with at all by the Judges of the Land, though done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Thames,</hi> or any other River or Port, but only other things
there happening; but how duly that was done, hath been before
examined upon his very propoſal of theſe two Statutes, and
what he promiſeth, ſhall appear afterwards; he apprehended that
all men muſt needs grant (which proveth farre otherwiſe) that
the Admiral hath no juriſdiction or power upon the Ports and
Havens, more then what this Clauſe giveth him, and therefore
ſaith he, this Clauſe giveth the Admiral further juriſdiction in
caſe of death, or maihme; and indeed by theſe words: <hi>Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
of the death of a man, and a maihme doen beneath the bridges;</hi> It may
at the firſt reading ſeem that the Admiral ſhould be before forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
to meddle with the cognizance of any thing elſe there, and
that the cognizance of theſe things ſhould only be reſerved unto
him, which withall would ſeem very ſtrange; and therefore more
duely weighed and conſidered, this word <hi>Nevertheleſs</hi> doth not
reſtrain the Admiral to theſe particulars only, <hi>viz.</hi> the death of
a man, and a maihme, and arreſting of Ships, &amp;c. but the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
ordaining immediately before, that all Contracts, Pleas and
Quarrels, and all other things ariſing within the bodies of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
as well by land as by water, ſhall be tried by the Law of the
Land, leſt the waters beneath the firſt Bridges ſhould be taken
to be within the bodies of Counties, and the Admiral, by the
words (as well by land as by water) ſhould be excluded from his
cognizance of things there done, under that General of <hi>as well by
land as by water,</hi> falleth this exception or limitation, <hi>Nevertheleſs
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:62625:115"/>
beneath the Bridges next unto the Sea, pluis procheyn al meer,</hi> (by them
diſtinguiſhing the waters within the bodies of Counties, from
thoſe that are not within the bodies of Counties) the Admiral
ſhall have cognizance of matters even of the higheſt nature, and
greateſt concernment, even of the death of a man, and a maihme,
arreſting of Ships, &amp;c. not <hi>excluſivè,</hi> excluding him from the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
of matters of an inferiour quality and nature; for by
the Arugument <hi>à majore ad minus,</hi> he that hath power in the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieſt
affairs, hath certainly power in matters of leſs conſequence,
and ſmaller concernment; and it doth ſeem ſtrange to me, that
any man ſhould think that the makers of this Statute (whom
Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> affirmeth to be curious therein) ſhould truſt the
Admiral with the cognizance of the death of a man, and a
maihme, &amp;c. where they ſhould not truſt him with the ſinking
or maihming of a Ship or Veſſel, ot of the cognizance of the
pilferings, or ſtealing of a Cable, or ſome ſuch petty trifle: and it
may as well be ſaid that the Admiral by this Statute hath power
to arreſt Ships in the great Flotes for the great Voyages of the
Common-wealth, but he hath no power to arreſt the Ships, Guns,
Boats, Tackle, or Furniture; or that when he hath arreſted ſuch
Ships, he hath no power to preſs Mariners, or to take up Victual,
Tackle, Furniture, or Ammunition for them; and how agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to reaſon (whereon all Laws ought to be grounded) this is,
I leave it to the judgement of all men; and though this arreſting
of Ships may be ſaid to be of no matter of cognizance, yet is there
the ſame reaſon of the one, there is of the other.</p>
               <p>Yet of matters cognoſcible by the Admiral, it may be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned,
why theſe two particulars, namely the death of a man, and
a maihme ſhould only be ſpecified, and nothing in general be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt,
for the cognizance of other things there done, if the ſame
were intended him, <hi>Ratio eſt in promptu.</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> could not
ſay, nor can I believe any man elſe, or ſhew that before the
making this Statute, the Common-Law Courts ever took
cognizance of any matters concerning Ships, or other Veſſels,
their Tackle, Furniture, Ammunition, or whatſoever elſe to
them belonging or appertaining, but alwayes left them to the
cognizance of the Admiral, as matters belonging to the Sea, and
ſo proper to the Sea Juriſdiction; but for the death of a man,
and a maihme, which oftentimes happen above the firſt Bridges
(where Ships neither do, nor can come conveniently) whereof
the Common Law had cognizance, and not diſtinguiſhing of
ſuch death or maihme, whether the ſame was done above or
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:62625:116"/>
beneath the ſaid bridges, they had unduly taken cognizance
thereof, as well beneath the bridges as above, as appeareth by
what Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> himſelf hath cited in this his <hi>22th</hi> chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of his Juriſdiction of Courts; out of the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the
Second, <hi>tit. coron.</hi> 399. where it is affirmed, that it is no part of the
Sea where one may ſee what is done one of part of the water, and
of the other,<note place="margin">8 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſhall exerciſe his Office in this caſe, and of this the County
may have knowledge, whereby (ſaith he) it appeareth that things
done there are triable by the Country (that is by Jury) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
not in the Admiralty Court. Now by his leave, it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
appears that they would have made it law, that of the death of
a man there, which concerneth the Coroners Office, they might
take cognizance; and this ſaith he is affirmed for law by <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>'s

                  <hi>and of the other, the Coroner ſhall enquire of this, and not the Admiral, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the Country may take cognizance of it.</hi> And he voucheth the ſaid
authority of the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the ſecond, whereupon he conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
in theſe words: ſo this proveth that by the Common Law,
before the Statute of the <hi>2d.</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth the Admiral had
no juriſdiction but upon the high Seas, which is no good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
if well obſerved, as if it were impoſsble that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Law could not by ſome men be miſtaken and made to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach
upon the Juriſdiction of the Admiralty, as the Admiralty
is accuſed to have done upon theirs; whereas here we ſee it
plain in the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, they had, or would have
done in this particular; and therefore in expreſs words doth this
Statute declare, that of the death of a man, and a maihme, the
Admiral ſhall have cognizance beneath the firſt bridges; let no
man therefore from this of the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
that the Admiral hath no Juriſdiction of any thing done
upon the Ports and Havens, or water, where one may ſee from
one ſide to the other, ſince that one particular from which a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
is argued (an argument never allowed amongſt Scholars
and Logicians) is by Statute corrected.</p>
               <p>For the reſt of the particulars, whereon Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> inſiſteth,
he inſtanceth not in any one before the making of theſe Statutes
(ſaving that before mentioned, and thus corrected by this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute)
nor of almoſt 30 years after the making of the laſt of three,
and well nigh 40 y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ars after the making of the firſt of them;
for it will be found to be little leſs then 30 years from the ſecond
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:62625:116"/>
of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, to the ſixth of <hi>Henry</hi> the 6. and little leſs then
40 from the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, to the <hi>6th</hi> of Henry the
Sixth, in which year the firſt Judgement is ſaid to be given in the
Court of Common-pleas, upon theſe Statutes, which Sir <hi>Edward
Coke</hi> affirmeth to be within 20 years of the making of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes;
and therefore his firſt obſervation upon the Judgment,
raiſed from this miſtaken ground is,<note place="margin">Sup. li. 2. ca. 5.</note> that it is <hi>contemporanea expoſitio,</hi>
which he ſaith is <hi>expoſitio optima,</hi> as is ſaid before, to which I may
without danger agree and conſent; for I ſhall in the next chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſave one ſhew that there is <hi>expoſitio magis contemporanea,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Inſ. cap. 7. li. 3.</note> and
will not very well agree either with this, or any other of theſe
latter Expoſitions of thoſe Statutes; and what is inferred upon
this Judgement by Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sup. li. 2. ca. 5.</note> that it depended in adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and deliberation, in the Court of Common-pleas eight
Terms, as is before repeated, will clearly take away what is both
by <hi>Stanford</hi> and himſelf affirmed in general, upon that one parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,
of the Coroners taking his Inqueſt upon the death of a
man upon the water, where one may ſee from the one ſide to
the other, by that of the eighth of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, namely
that it appeareth, that by the Common Law before the Statute,
things done there were tryable by the Country (that is by Jury)
and not i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the Admiralty Court; for if this had been ſo clear as
both theſe two would make it, then needed not the Judges of
the Common-Pleas have adviſed or deliberated two days upon
that point, wherewith they were troubled two years; which
long deliberation and adviſement plainly ſheweth, that they were
at firſt very loth to adventure themſelves upon the ſeas (though at
a Port) where they had never been before, yet at length they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured,
but truely, without any offence be it ſaid, in a rotten
Barque, without either Pilot or Stearſman, as I conceive ſuch a
Voyage hath ſeldome been taken ſince, untill Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>'s
time, immediately after which ſome have followed his Barque
or Veſſel, and will ſo continue, if their Voyage be not ſtopt. But I
ſhall proceed unto the next Statute, leaving that point of the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance
of wreck of ſea in this Statute mentioned (which is a
thing that concerneth not Contracts, &amp;c. about Maritime affairs
made at land) unto a chapter by it ſelf.</p>

               <head type="sub">The Argument deduced out of the Statute of the ſecond of
Henry the Fourth, cap. 11. to prove the Contracts made
at land concerning Maritime affairs, are not cognizable

               <p>THe Statute of the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth is likewiſe urged
againſt the Admirals cognizance of Contracts and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants
made at Land concerning Maritime affairs, and
hath been uſually recited in prohibitions with the other two.</p>
               <p>This Statute is thus rendred by Sir <hi>Edward Coke.</hi> It is enacted
(ſaith he) that the Act of the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, <hi>cap.</hi> 5. be
firmly holden, and kept, and put in due execution, and further
at the prayer of the Commons, that as touching a pain to be ſet
upon the Admiral, or his Lieutenant, that the Statute and the
Common Law ſhall be holden againſt them, and the party grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
ſhall recover his double damages.</p>
               <p>For the firſt part of the Statute he apprehendeth that he hath
given a due expoſition of that of the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond,
by ſetting down the anſwer to the Petition, without any relation
to the Petition it ſelf, and then indeed this Statute to ordain that
the former ſhould be firmly holden, and kept, and put in due ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution,
would have made ſomewhat to his purpoſe: But if that
firſt Statute be duly examined, and receive a due conſtruction, then
I conceive this will no wayes advance his cauſe. He further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth,
that becauſe this Statute doth ordain, as touching a pain
to be ſet upon the Admiral, or his Lieutenant, that the Statute
and Common Law ſhould be holden againſt them; That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it appeareth by this Act, that the Statute of the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>Richard</hi>
the ſecond is but an affirmance of the Common Law,<note place="margin">

promiſeth ſhall afterwards appear, which I with much diligence
in my reading expected, but could find nothing more, then
what (as I hope) hath in its due place received an anſwer. And
if we examine the original Statutes, and <hi>Poulton's</hi> Tranſlation of
this part of this Statute, they will plainly ſhew what Statute, and
what Common Law ſhall be holden againſt them.</p>
               <p>I ſhall therefore here ſet down the Statute according to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal,

purſue in the Admiralty Court, and recover his double dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges

               <p>Now it plainly appeareth by the Original, which I have here
verbatim ſet down, that this Statute is onely in confirmation
of the former Statute as originally enacted, according to the
true conſtruction thereof, which taken together with that expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>Richard</hi> the 2. hath truely rendred of that
and the ſame, being taken with relation to the Petition as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
it ought to be, and by Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> and <hi>Poultons</hi> Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
here, it is in affirmance of the firſt of them onely, as <hi>Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:62625:118"/>
himſelf hath in his Tranſlation thereof rendred it; ſo that
neither of theſe two Tranſlations agree with the Original, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
in this, that he that ſhall find himſelf aggrieved againſt the
form thereof, ſhall recover double damages againſt the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant.</p>
               <p>Now what may be called Damages that ſhall be recovered
double by this Statute, is a great queſtion: If a man do ſue in the
Admiralty Court, and there recover, and is paid a juſt and due
debt of 100 <hi>l.</hi> which he ought to have ſued for in the Common
Law, and might have there ſurely recovered, the queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the other party can be ſaid to be damni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed, that 100 <hi>l.</hi> over
and above his expences and trouble; I cannot imagine any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
man will ſay he was. What ſhall be thought then of
the leading caſe, <hi>Hil. 6. H.</hi> 6. in the Common Pleas, cited by Sir
<hi>Edward Coke</hi> for the firſt that received Judgement in that Court
upon this Statute, of double damages, who ſaith that <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew
Putt</hi> ſued <hi>John Burton</hi> in the Admiralty, for that he by force
of arms, three Ships of the ſaid <hi>Bartholomews</hi> with his Priſoners
and Merchandizes to the value of 960 marks, odd money, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the ſaid Ships, did take, and carry away, ſuppoſing the
taking to be <hi>ſuper altum mare,</hi> whereas it was in the Haven of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow:</hi>
whereupon the ſaid <hi>Burton</hi> ſued the ſaid <hi>Putt</hi> upon the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes,
and a verdict was found for the ſaid <hi>Burton</hi> againſt the ſaid
<hi>Putt,</hi> and damages aſſeſſed unto 700 <hi>l.</hi> and Judgement given
double for 1400 <hi>l.</hi> In this place, I ſhall ſet aſide the Queſtion,
whether this caſe was proper to the Admiralty Court, or the
Common Law, having ſpoken to that purpoſe already in a
place more proper;<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>up. li. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> cap. 5.</note> and here onely examine the queſtion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the damages, and them doubled. It doth not appear by
any thing is ſaid by Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> that <hi>Putt</hi> had either received
from, or ſo much as recovered of the ſaid <hi>Burton</hi> the ſaid 900
marks, or any part thereof; and yet the ſaid <hi>Burton</hi> is found there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
be damnified the ſaid 900 marks, beſides 100 <hi>l.</hi> more for his
expence and trouble, all which is double by the Judgement; ſo
that by this Judgement he was barred and hindred any tryal for
his 900 marks, or whatſoever elſe he ſhould prove himſelf to
be damnified, which no man can or could then ſay he was not
to have recovered in one of the ſaid Courts, but was condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to pay 1400 <hi>l.</hi> damages to <hi>Burton,</hi> who was damnified no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more then his expence, and ſome trouble in a wrong
Court (as is pretended) for what he had unjuſtly done, for
ought ever appeared, or was ever attempted to be made appear,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:62625:118"/>
and he hereby acquitted of that Act, how unjuſt ſoever.</p>
               <p>If it might have been granted (which may not be) that the
Admiral had no juriſdiction nor cognizance of this Cauſe, yet
ſurely that Court which had, might firſt have examined whether
<hi>Burtons</hi> act, complained of, was an unjuſt act or not, and whether
<hi>Putt</hi> ſhould not there have recovered 900 marks as well as in the
Admiralty Court; and certainly if he ſhould, then cannot I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
how <hi>Burton</hi> can be ſaid to be damnified that 900 marks
which might elſewhere have been recovered, and obtained againſt
him; nor can I judge that he being ſued for 900 marks, which
neither were or could there or elſewhere have been obtained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
him, was thereby damnified 900 marks. I ſhall therefore
leave it here to be conſidered, whether ſuch a Judgement once
given at the Common Law, is to be held firme and continued
for law ever after, or not.</p>
               <p>But I muſt not paſs over a main objection, which might have
been, or may hereafter be raiſed out of this Statute, as the ſame
is by <hi>Poulton</hi> rendered, which is this: The Statute (as he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth
it) ſaith, that whereas in the Statute made at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi>
the thirteenth year of King <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> amongſt other
things, it is contained that the Admirals and their Deputies ſhall
not intermeddle from henceforth of any thing done within the
Realm, but only of a thing done upon the ſea, &amp;c. ſo that here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it may ſeem, and be very well urged that this Statute doth
clearly confirme the Statute of the <hi>13th</hi> of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond, as
the ſame is both by <hi>Poulton</hi> and Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> rendered and
tranſlated without any relation to the Petition: but if this very
Statute be duly conſidered, it will plainly appear that <hi>Poulton</hi> hath
here thruſt in a repetition of the former Statute, according to his
own former rendering thereof,<note place="margin">Sup. hoc cap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>.</note> to make the ſame good, which
the original before inſerted in this very chapter, being conſulted
withall, will not allow him; for there is not one word of this
repetition mentioned either in the Petition or Anſwer, <hi>quod vide;</hi>
for the Petition is that the Statutes made in the time of <hi>Richard</hi>
the ſecond touching the Juriſdiction of the Admiralty, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
the one as well as the other, as well the latter which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth
the true conſtruction of the former, according unto the
true meaning thereof, taken with relation to the Petition, as I
cannot conceive but that it ought to be, as the former of the <hi>13th</hi>
of <hi>Richard</hi> the ſecond may be held and firmly kept, and that the
Admirals and their Lieutenants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may not hold any manner of
plea in the Court of the Admiralty, contrary to the form and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance

or of the other.</p>
               <p>So then theſe former Statutes, being onely conſidered with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to the Petitions, whereunto they are anſwers, I conceive
this Statute affordeth no Argument at all againſt the Admirals
Juriſdiction, or cognizance of Contracts made at Land, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Maritime affairs, more then what the other afforded;

ſo that the largeſt part of four in this computation, is abated, to
bring this Judgement within the compaſs of a contemporary
expoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but indeed this Judgement muſt be grounded as
well upon the two former, as this latter, and principally upon
the firſt of them; and then is this Judgement 37 years and more
after the making of that Statute, the ſame being made in <hi>Anno</hi>
1389. this Statute therefore having not born this conſtruction or
expoſition from the time of the making of it, until 37 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and upwards, this being the firſt Judgement thereupon (as
is confeſt) and that given by the Judges, not without a great
deal of doubting for the ſpace of eight Terms, before they could

agree, or would adventure to give that conſtruction, or ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
thereof, though tending <hi>ad ſuam juriſdictonem ampliandam,</hi>
I cannot apprehend that this was <hi>contemporanea,</hi> or <hi>optima expoſitio,</hi>
nor do I find by all the particulars cited by Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this matter, that this Judgement was ever purſued as a
preſident or example, by the ſame, or other ſucceeding
Judges.</p>
               <p>Indeed two Actions he inſtanceth in brought upon the ſame
ground, one by <hi>Cupper</hi> againſt <hi>Rayner,</hi> and the other by <hi>Wydewell</hi>

But he ſpeaketh not of any Judgement given therein, which if
there had, he would not willingly have omitted to have inſerted

was given upon either of them, nor indeed can I think that the
former Judgement by him cyted, ever took any effect, or was ever
put in execution.</p>
               <p>If Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi>'s rule be true, that <hi>contemporanea expoſitio eſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tima,</hi>

               <p>Now for the three Records inſtanced in by Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi>
and brought out of the Courts of the Common Law, againſt
the Admirals Juriſdiction upon the Ports and Havens, and in
matters of contracts upon buſineſſes to be agitated at ſea, I have
ſhewed four out of the Chancery which was then (as by his own
ſetting forth appeareth) the only Court enabled to grant Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

the Kings Anſwer was.</p>
               <p>The Chancellor by the advice of the Juſtices upon hearing of
the matter, ſhall remit the matter to the Common Law, and
grant a Prohibition.</p>
               <p>And as theſe Records are of farre greater antiquity then thoſe
by him inſtanced in, ſo are they farre more contemporary with
the ſaid Statutes; and therefore, by his own rule, of farre greater
authority.</p>

ſet forth what was done, and that but as thoſe three ſeveral
times in thoſe Courts, <hi>ſed quo jure, non arguitur.</hi> But it may be very
well apprehended, that in 27 years after the making of the laſt
of thoſe Statutes, and 37 after the making of the firſt of them,
the Petitions upon which thoſe Statutes were grounded, and
from whence they muſt receive a right conſtruction, began to be
forgotten; but after the ſame were revived and brought again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
remembrance, and Admiralty Court had no more ſuch inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions,
but proceeded as before untill the times of thoſe Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
wherein he inſtanceth which were brought in farre later
times then the former, when the ſaid Petitions, whereunto the
Anſwers have, or ought to have reference, were (as it were) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
quite out of remembrance: For if from the time of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of thoſe Statutes, untill the time of the laſt of the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
inſtanced in, all the particular Actions that have been
brought, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>tences that have been given in the Admiralty
for things done upon the Ports and Havens (againſt the cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance

all the Actions brought, and Sentences that have been there gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
upon Contracts made at land for buſineſſes to be agitated at
ſea, againſt which the other two Judgments are brought, ſhould
be ſet forth, I might boldly ſay there would be many hundreds
for one; and I might very well, and very juſtly cite divers of
thoſe Records out of the Regiſtry of the Admiralty for the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of that Court in matters of this nature, which I doubt not
but ought to be as good proof for the Juriſdiction of that Court
whereunto they do belong, as thoſe few Records pickt up out
of the Regiſtry of the Common Law Courts ought to make for
that Juriſdiction whereunto they belong; nay by thoſe Records
of the Admiralty, and the conſtant, the continued, and the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
practice and uſage of taking cognizance of Cauſes of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note>
it plainly appeareth that the Juriſdiction thereof anciently
did, and ſtill doth belong unto that Court; for in land buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
whoſe land or ſoil ſhall we judge that to be, but his who hath
generally, continuedly, and conſtantly reapt the Crop, and not
his who hath at ſome times come by and taken up a a Shock or
two, and ſo done as much as he which reapt where he never
ſowed? which he muſt needs do which is neither verſt nor skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in <hi>jure ſcripto,</hi> in that Law which is poſitively ſet down for
that purpoſe, but ſhall judge thereof at randam, and will ſo do
becauſe others have done ſo before him; nor under correction
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:62625:123"/>
can it be held to be any good rule of Juſtice to judge by preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
for if one man, or more, have judged unjuſtly, and not
according to law, I would not have it ſaid, that he which know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the law, is notwithſtanding bound to judge as the other did,
becauſe he hath a preſident for it. But I ſhall paſs them preſidents
over, and as I have in the ſecond book of this Treatiſe ſhewed
you, that even by Records out of the Chancery and Common
Law, things done upon Ports and Havens are cognizable in the
Admiralty Court, ſo I ſhall here ſhew that by Records of the
ſame Courts the Admiralty hath cognizance of Contracts made

<hi>Weſtm.</hi> decimo quarto die <hi>Aprilis,</hi> Anno Regni noſtri trice ſimo primo.</p>
               <p>Now I ſhall here by the way obſerve unto you this thing
in particular out of this laſt <hi>Suprrſedeas,</hi> and out of theſe words,
<hi>apud Civitatem</hi> Burdugaliae, <hi>venditioni expoſitis,</hi> That though by
the courſe of the Common Law, if a man do deliver certain
Goods unto another man, and doth intruſt him with the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them, for his the Owners uſe, or to be by him diſpoſed of
in one manner, and he either ſelleth them, or diſpoſeth of them
in another (I do conceive) he that ſo intruſted the other, may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
of him ſuch damage as he hath ſuſtained by ſuch the others
ſale, or diſpoſal. Yet if a Merchant doth intruſt a Maſter of a
Ship with his Wares or Merchandizes to be tranſported to any
Port or place beyond the Seas, for his own uſe, or for the uſe of
any other particular man, to whom the ſame are by him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:62625:125"/>
or doth intruſt him to diſpoſe of them in any particular
manner whatſoever; yet he may in many caſes upon certain exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies
happening ſometimes ſell the ſame, ſometimes he may
diſpoſe of them otherwiſe then he was appointed by the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
or Owner of them, and no damage ſhall be by the courſe
of the Civil and Maritime Laws recovered of him; and herein
thoſe Laws have very many nice and curious diſtinctions: and
for this Cauſe, when the Merchant very well knoweth that in
ſuch cauſes he cannot in the Admiralty Court recover any dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
at all, he preſently flyeth to the Common Law, where he
knoweth he ſhall recover damage againſt the Maſter, who was
in no fault at all; in ſuch manner as mutinous and diſobedient
Mariners (who have either through their miſdemeanors by the
Civil and Maritime Laws, forfeited their wages, or ſome part
thereof, or having received due correction from the Maſter at
ſea) do fly to the Common Law, either for recovery of their
wages upon their Contract, which they have no wayes deſerved,
or do there bring their Actions of Battery againſt the Maſter,
when as he hath only given them ſuch due correction, as the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
and Maritime Laws do allow, that being a thing done at ſea,
where complaint cannot be preſently made, or remedy had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a Magiſtrate, (as may be at land) and therefore the like at
land not to be allowed, in both which caſes they oftentimes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
and are gone on another voyage before the Maſter can
make proof of their miſdemeanour done either beyond or upon
the ſeas, which cannot oftentimes be poſsibly done, but by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion
out of the Admiralty Court, which turneth exceeding
much to the diſheartning and diſcouraging of Maſters and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
of Ships, which if not remedied, will be the utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of Navigation.</p>
               <p>And another thing I ſhall obſerve in general from both the
two preceding <hi>Superſedeas's,</hi> That all Contracts of and concerning
Maritime affairs made between Merchant and Merchant, Maſters
and Owners of Ships and Mariners, or between them or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perſon whatſoever, and in what manner ſoever, to be agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
or performed by ſea, upon the ſeas, beyond the ſeas, or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
within the Juriſdiction of the Admiralty, or taking their
riſe or original from thence, or do in any manner of wiſe touch,
or concern the ſame, were not permitted in thoſe times to be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
or adjudged in any Court but the Admiralty.</p>
               <p>And theſe <hi>Superſedeas's</hi> in my judgment are a full confirmation
of the Expoſition I have before rendered of the two before go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:62625:126"/>
Statutes, <hi>viz.</hi> that Contracts of this nature, though made at
land, which do <hi>maris per tranſitum, ſive viagium, aut negotia mariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
quoquo modo reſpicere vel qualitercunque tangere &amp; concernere,</hi> and ſo
do ariſe from things done, or to be done at ſea, and not from
things done, or to be done within the body of a County, do <hi>de
jure</hi> belong unto the Cognizance of the Admiralty, and are in no
wiſe by the ſaid two Statutes taken from the ſame, and if by them
not taken from thence, then doth not the penalty of the other
praementioned Statute of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, run upon thoſe that
do ſue in the Admiralty Court in cauſes of this nature, but only
upon ſuch as ſhall there ſue upon Contracts made at land, of or
concerning things done or to be done, or performed at land; and
hereof you ſhall have further confirmation by Conſulations
granted at the Common Law upon Prohibitions from thence
upon falſe ſuggeſtions iſſued.</p>

Batchelor of Laws, &amp; Commiſſary of the Court of the Admiralty
in the Northern parts of <hi>England,</hi> and Judge of the Vice-Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty
of <hi>York,</hi> upon a contract before that time made between them
the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> and <hi>Thomas;</hi> and thereupon layd and articled
in the ſaid Court, that in the Moneths of <hi>April</hi> and <hi>May</hi> 1586. they
the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> had ſpeech or talk between them,
concerning certain quarters of Wheat and Rye, to the number of
69 or thereabouts, namely forty and one quarters of Wheat, and
twenty and eight quarters of Rye, whereof part was to be taken
into a certain Ship called the <hi>George</hi> of <hi>Beverley</hi> at a certain place
called <hi>Emot-land</hi> upon the River of <hi>Hull, alias Hull</hi> Water, and the
other part thereof to be taken into the ſaid Ship at a certain place
called the <hi>Good Alehouſe,</hi> adjoyning to the ſaid River, to be from
thence carryed and conveyed in the ſaid Ship by water, unto the
City of <hi>York,</hi> and there to be delivered on Shipboard at a certain
place called the <hi>Queens Stathe</hi> at the ſaid City, and further had talk
of the freight or price to be paid for the carriage of the ſaid quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Grain, and that they the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained
and agreed concerning the ſaid carriage and tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſaid Grain in the ſaid Ship the <hi>George,</hi> in forme fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,
<hi>viz.</hi> that the ſaid <hi>Thomas Sympſon</hi> ſhould take and receive

and the ſaid other place called the <hi>Good Alehouſe,</hi> and ſhould from
thence tranſport and carry the ſame with all convenient ſpeed to
the <hi>Queens Stath</hi> aforeſaid, being beneath the firſt Bridge of the
River of <hi>Owre</hi> towards the ſea, and there deliver the ſame on
Shipboard, and that in conſideration thereof; the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher
Turner</hi> did agree to and with the ſaid <hi>Thomas Sympſon</hi> for the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſportation
of every quarter of the ſaid Grain, to pay the ſumme
of ten pence of lawfull money of <hi>England;</hi> and further, that the
ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher Turner</hi> in conſideration that the ſaid Grain might
be more ſafely and ſecurely tranſported and carried, then other
his Grain before that time had been, and that the ſame might
not be heated, wetted, or otherwiſe impaired, as before that time,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:62625:128"/>
other his the ſaid <hi>Chriſtophers</hi> Grain had been in other leſſer Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of his, the ſaid <hi>Thomas Sympſon</hi> promiſed and agreed to and
with the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher,</hi> that if the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> ſhould not
deliver into the ſaid Ship called the <hi>George</hi> ſixty quarters of Grain,
nevertheleſs in regard that Ship was of a greater burthen then
other Ships of the ſaid <hi>Thomas Sympſons</hi> were; he the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher</hi>
would pay to the ſaid <hi>Thomas Sympſon</hi> or his Aſsignes the whole
freight for ſixty quarters of Grain according to the rate of ten
pence for every quarter of the aforeſaid Grain; and if there
ſhould be more then ſixty quarters of the ſaid Grain, that then
the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher Turner</hi> ſhould pay for every quarter above the
number of ſixty quarters, according to the ſaid rate of ten pence
for every quarter thereof. And that the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof promiſed and convenanted to and with the ſaid <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopher
Turner,</hi> that no Grain or Goods of other men ſhould be
received into the ſaid Ship in the ſaid Voyage; and that the ſaid
Ship ſhould be ſufficiently manned and victualled, ſo that by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
thereof the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher Turners</hi> Grain might be ſafely tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
and carried without any heating, wetting, or other im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>Which cauſe was afterwards removed from the ſaid Court of

the Admiralty of <hi>England,</hi> and there in the end of the 31 year of
the ſaid Queens Reign depended undecided.</p>
               <p>And the ſaid <hi>Thomas Sympſon</hi> in <hi>Hillary</hi> Terme following ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
in the Kings Bench that the ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> had libelled in
the high Court of the Admiralty,<note place="margin">Hil. 32. Eliz.</note> that the ſaid Contract was
made at <hi>Beverley,</hi> within the Body of the County of <hi>York,</hi> and
that the ſaid Contract was, that one part of the ſaid Grain was
to be received into the ſaid Ship at a certain place called <hi>Emot-land</hi>
upon the River of <hi>Humber, alias Hull</hi>-water, whereas indeed the
ſaid <hi>Chriſtopher</hi> had libelled in the Court of Admiralty before the
ſaid <hi>Matthew Dodſworth</hi> in the Northern parts, that that Contract
was, that the ſaid Grain ſhould be received into the ſaid Ship at
the ſaid places called <hi>Emot-land,</hi> and <hi>Good Alehouſe</hi> upon the River
of <hi>Hull, alias Hull</hi>-Water, and not upon the River of <hi>Humber, alias
Hull</hi>-Water: And whereas that plea upon the ſaid Libel only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
in the High Court of the Admiralty, by way of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
aforeſaid by him the ſaid <hi>Thomas Sympſon,</hi> in form aforeſaid
proſecuted, and otherwiſe he prayed a Prohibition from the ſaid

in performance of the ſaid work in their Art, about the ſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
or building of a ſmall Ship or Pinnace for the ſaid <hi>William,</hi>

being built, ſhe was named or called by the ſaid <hi>William,</hi> The

his proper Ship or Veſſel; and the ſaid <hi>Thomas Freeman</hi> cauſed the

by which means the ſaid <hi>Hugh Lydyard</hi> was conſtrained to appear

               </p>
               <p>The ſaid <hi>Hugh Lydyard</hi> alleaging the Statutes of the 13 and 15

further ſuggeſting the ſame to be done, and the ſaid Contracts to
be made within the body of the County of <hi>Kent,</hi> and not within
the Juriſdiction of the <hi>Admiralty;</hi> &amp; that therefore the Action was
brought contrary to the form of the ſaid Statutes, and procured
a Prohibition to the Court of the Admiralty; but upon conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of the whole matter, the ſaid Court upon the laſt day of
<hi>January</hi> in the <hi>45th</hi> year of the ſaid Queens Reign awarded a

Conſultation, and remitted the ſaid Cauſe to the Admiralty
Court.</p>
               <p>And now in regard that the fact in this caſe was agreed on
both ſides, and therefore no repetition made of the Libel in the
Body of the Conſultation, the right of juriſdiction and power
of the cognizance of the cauſe being only in queſtion, and
in regard this Prohibition and Conſultation iſſued out of the
Court of Common-pleas, and the former mentioned out of the
Kings's-Bench, take this Conſultation at large as it came to, and
remaineth in the Regiſtry of the Admiralty.</p>

in the <hi>9th</hi> year of King <hi>Charles,</hi> a Conſultation was awarded as in

               <p>Hence I do obſerve that all theſe Judges which granted theſe
before mentioned Conſultations, have heretofote afforded the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:62625:135"/>
mentioned Statutes the ſame interpretation that I have ſince
gathered, and in this Treatiſe ſet down, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Contract,
whether made at land or at ſea, if the ſame doth ariſe from a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
to be done or performed at land, the ſame is to be tried
by the Law of the land: But a contract, whether made at ſea
or at land, if the ſame doth ariſe from a buſineſs to be done or
performed by or at ſea, or beyond the ſea, the ſame is cognoſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the Admiralty Court.<note place="margin">Sup. li. 3. ca. 2, 3, 4, &amp;c.</note> For upon the granting theſe Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
the queſtion was not whether either the Contracts or
the Charter-parties were made at ſea, or at land, or whether they
were made in the Pariſh of St. <hi>Mary le Bow,</hi> or St. <hi>Michael Cornhill,</hi>
or not; but whether the ſame were Maritime contracts, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
Marrtime buſineſs or not, and ſo within the Juriſdiction
of the Admiralty, or not; as in the firſt of theſe five laſt cited
Conſultations concerning the building of a Ship, the queſtion
was not, whether the contracts for the wages in building of her,
or the materials bought and imployed upon her, the meat and
drink bought and ſpent in the time of the building of her were
made at land or not, or whether the Ship her ſelf was built at
land or at ſea; for the caſe was plain in the one as well as in the
other, that the Ship was built at land as all Ships are upon the
Stocks, is no doubt at all: and the Ship being there built, it is as
little doubt that the contracts were there made, nnleſs we will
ſuppoſe that which is not to be ſuppoſed, <hi>viz.</hi> that the parties
went to ſea to bargain for the building of her at land, and to bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
for materials to build her with, and for meat and drink to
be ſpent in the time of the works being in hand; but the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
was, whether theſe contracts concerned a buſineſs that was
maritime or not, which did ariſe from ſomewhat to be done at
or by ſea, or not; and it being plain, that had it not been for ſea
imployment, none of theſe contracts had been made. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
was it adjudged that theſe contracts did ariſe from buſineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
to be done at ſea, and were therefore maritime, and belonged
unto the maritime Juriſdiction of the Admiralty, as all other
contracts for victualling, tackling and furniſhing of Ships, with
either Anchors, Cables, or other Ropes, or whatſoever other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries,
(although the ſame were contracted for and bought at
land) anciently were and did belong, and of right ſtill are, and
do belong.</p>
               <p>And as for the Contracts and Charter-parties made of letting
Ships to freight, it is ſure enough that they are ſeldome or never
made but at land; yet are theſe contracts made of and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:62625:135"/>
a Ship which at the very time of the making thereof is, <hi>Aut
ſuper mare fluctuans, aut ad Anchoras in quovis portu natans infra fluxum
&amp; refluxm maris infra Juriſdictionem Admirallitatis,</hi> either ſailing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Seas, or lying at Anchor in ſome Port or Haven, where
the Sea ebbeth and floweth within the Juriſdiction of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty.
And theſe contracts do ariſe from buſineſſes to be done at
ſea, and were therefore adjudged to belong unto the Sea Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p>But perhaps it may be ſtill objected that the Law doth allow
a fiction of place for the doing of any thing, and it mattereth
not whether the thing was there done or not; and I do agree
that the Law doth allow ſuch a fiction, ſo that the ſame be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the compaſs of a poſsibility. But to feign a thing impoſsible,
as to fain that Ships ſail in <hi>Cheapſide,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Sup. li. 3. cap.</note> or elſewhere upon the dry
land, the Law abhorreth, as I have ſaid before.</p>
               <p>And then is it more proper and more agreeable to law to feign
the Charter-party that was made at land to have been made at
ſea, which is poſsible, then it is to feign a Ship to be at land,

obligatory was adjudged cognoſcible in the Admiralty Court,

               <p>But it may be ſaid that many more Prohibitions have been
granted out of both the ſaid Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> as well in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of this nature, as in cauſes for things done upon Ports and
Havens, upon which Conſultations have not been had, and I
doubt not but in latter times there have; but it hath for the moſt
part been when the parties have agreed, and the cauſe compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and ſo no Conſultation prayed or ſought for, if otherwiſe,
let no man brag of that which hath been done, which ought not
to be done. But another cauſe may be given, and that is this,
that the Civilian not being ſuffered there to plead the right of
Juriſdiction belonging to the Admiralty, the ſame hath not been
undertaken by any practicers in thoſe Courts, and if undertaken,
yet pleaded but coldly againſt the Juriſdiction of their own
Courts: Howſoever I do conceive that the <hi>Procedendoes</hi> out of
the Chancery, and the Conſultations out of the Kings Bench
and Common Pleas, which I have in this and the ſecond Book
of this Treatiſe ſet forth (though I might have inſtanced in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
many more) will be ſufficient to determine the right of Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
as well in cauſes of the one nature, as of the other againſt
the ſaid ſeveral Courts from whence ſuch <hi>Superſedeaſes</hi> and <hi>Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
were granted.</p>
               <p>I will not ſay but that the Admiralty Court may ſometime
have intermedled with Contracts made at land, ariſing from
buſineſſes done or to be done or performed at land, which is
here in <hi>England,</hi> as it were to take Cattle from a Paſture and put
into the ſea to feed. And in ſuch caſes I doubt not but a Prohibiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
may lye, which ſhall not be diſſolved by Conſultation.</p>
               <p>But by Prohibitions to take buſineſſes of the Ports and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
or Contracts made at land concerning Maritime affairs
from the Admiralty, to be determined by the Common-Law of
the land, is to take fiſh out of the ſea to be kept alive and fed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
paſture, or in ſome Forreſt or Park at land.</p>
               <p>For I ſhall in the next Chapter out of many ſhew you ſome
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:62625:137"/>
few of thoſe exact rules the Civil Law hath to proceed by in cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

not conſiderable without the reſt, which taken altogether
with their diviſions, diſtinctions, deciſions and determinations,
would make by themſelves a whole Tract <hi>de jure Admirallitatis,</hi>
which would be a Book to little or no purpoſe, nor receive any
welcome, unleſs this which is <hi>de ejus Juriſdictione,</hi> may firſt receive
ſome entertainment, which how neceſſary and advantagious the
ſame may redound unto this Kingdome, I ſhall leave to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of him that hath or ſhall throughly read this Maritime
Dicaeologie.</p>
               <p>THis ſmall Treatiſe which I have written in Vindication of
the Juriſdiction of the Lord High Admiral of <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi>
I doubt not but will receive this Addition of Advantage, as to
tend likewiſe to the vindication and clearing of the honour and
reputation of thoſe Reverend and Learned Judges of the Land
(the two Lords Chief Juſtices, the Lord Chief Baron, and the
reſt of the then Judges their Aſſociates, together with the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney
General) whoſe Judgements and Juſtice have been ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed,
and unworthily aſperſed by ſome of their own Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:62625:139"/>
in ſaying thoſe Reverend Judges were queſtioned in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for ſetting their hands unto an Agreement made (before
his Majeſty of Bleſſed Memory <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt) between them
his Judges of the Land, and Sir <hi>Henry Martin</hi> Judge then of his
High Court of Admiralty, purporting in ſubſtance the matter of
this Treatiſe.</p>
               <p>It's true, I have heard that ſome of the Puiſne Lawyers, and
young men of that Profeſsion (ſitting in the Long Parliament)
would have attempted ſuch an undiſcreet, and unparelleld act;
but by the gravity and wiſdome of others more learned in that
Profeſsion then themſelves, were diſſwaded from it. Yet if they
had, I doubt not but he that reads this Treatiſe, will find ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
reaſons to juſtify their aſſent to that agreement, and that
it contained nothing but what they might and ought to do, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the Judgements of their Predeceſſours or Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours.</p>
               <p>Others do not forbear or ſtick to ſay this Subſcription to this
Agreement was an extrajudiciall act, and ſo takes not the effect
of a Law either to bind them or their Succeſſours, as though the
place and formality of ſitting upon the Bench were of the eſſence
of a true and juſt opinion; and the Judges being called and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened
by ſpecial ſummons before his Majeſty, that their Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and Opinions there delivered in matters propounded, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated,
and argued, were of leſs force and validity, and more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traneous
to reaſon, then if they were judicially ſitting.</p>
               <p>Which is an opinion that I cannot conceive any man of ſound
judgement can adhere unto; and therefore I ſhall conclude this
Treatiſe with that judgement given by thoſe twelve Learned and
Reverend Judges of the Land, with the conſent of that famous
Man Mr. <hi>Noy,</hi> his Majeſties Attorney General.</p>
