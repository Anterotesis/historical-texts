            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Cloaks againe, if any hue and cry came after them they would never suspect any of the Bish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops men, for when they came to any Inne, the Bishop was honoured as much as a man of his qualitie, his Gentleman-Usher stood bare all the while he was at dinner or supper; but this held not long before the Countrie had gotten some notice of it, whereupon they resolve to rid themselvs of their Coach, lest by that they should be betrayed, so riding on the <hi>Downes</hi> they called to an old Shepheard, saying if you please to be merry with us to night, you shall doe as we do; the old man was willing to goe with them. <hi>Allen</hi> told him that he would make him Lord Bishop for that night, so they put on the Bishops habit on the Shepheard and it did become him well; then they instructed him how to behave himselfe, so they came to an Inne where in great pomp they supped; supper being ended the Bishops servants went to have their Lord to bed, hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in bed they came downe and told the Host that their Lord was fallen very sick and that he desired a Doctor, so they enquired for a Doctor but there was none in seven miles, then they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Letters, &amp; all the men were sent with spare Horses, some to fetch friends to see their Lord, and some for the Doctor, so that they left no ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to wait on the Bishop, they had also char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Shepheard not to knock, till the next morning, and ordered the people of the house when their Lord knockt to carry him a cawdle, so they conveyed away their Bishops Robes, &amp;

left the Shepheards owne Cloathes by his bed-side and bid farewell to their Shepheard and their Coach, but about ten of the clock in the morning the shepheard awaked out of his dream and knockt for the people, who brought him up a Cawdle, he askes for his men, they tell him, some were gone for the Doctor, and some for his friends, perceiving himselfe abused he bid the servant goe downe for his Master, the fellow well eying the shepheard, tells his Master that the Bishop had a Canvas shirt on his back as black as the Divell, and that there was a paire of shooes stood by the bed as full of Hobnails, as the skye of starrs, and a thread bare coat fit for nothing but to make shooe clouts; up goes the Host to sée his Guest, who by that time had drest himselfe in his owne habit, and thus salutes him; Friend quoth he, I have bin robbed to night of mine honour, but they left me my old clothes, whereat the Host began to laugh, and said to the shepheard, my Lord if you please to buy you two Coach Horses, I will lend you a Coach and Harnesse to carry your honour to the shéep fold, so the shepheard related all the storie to the Host, and left him his Coach for the reckoning, and bid them adieu.</p>
