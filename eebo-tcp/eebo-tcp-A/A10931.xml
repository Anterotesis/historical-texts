            <title>Certaine sermons preached and penned by Richard Rogers preacher of Weathersfield in Essex, directly tending to these three ends. First, to bring any bad person (that hath not committed the sinne that is vnpardonable) to true conuersion. Secondly, to stablish and settle all such as are conuerted, in faith and repentance. Thirdly, to leade them forward (that are so setled) in the Christian life, to bring foorth the fruite of both. Whereunto are annexed diuers godlie and learned sermons of another reuerend and faithfull seruant of God, Mr. Samuel Wright, Bachelor of Diuinitie, late president of Sidney Colledge in Camebridge, deceased, tending also to the same ends, with diuers particular points in both, profitable and fit for these times.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE RIGHT HO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOVRABLE EDVVARD DENNY, Lord Baron of <hi>Waltam,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is recorded in holie Scripture (right Honourable) that <hi>Iehoſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi> King of Iudah,<note place="margin">2. Chron. 17.7.</note> much renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned for his pietie, did ſend out his Princes to teach in the Cities of Iudah. By which act of his, and the ſetting downe of it by the holie Ghoſt, although I goe not about to confound their office and dutie with the Prophets and Leuites, yet they are not on the other ſide, to be taken and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as nothing; I meane both his act, and the report of it by the holie ſtorie. For though they did not preach to the people in the cities whither they came, hauing Leuites with them, to doe that ſeruice, yet their countenancing, authorizing, and backing of the Leuites, who did teach the people indeed; is not without cauſe ſaid to be a preaching; ſeeing it made way to the people receiuing of it with much more readineſſe and cheerefulneſſe, then otherwiſe they would haue done: yea, they were much more incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to the zealous embracing and profeſſing of it, with fruits following, and that by the aduancing and magnifying of it by ſuch noble and worthy perſons,
<pb facs="tcp:16609:3"/>
then might haue bin looked for at their hands other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p>For though the word of God, and the pure do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine taught out of it, be of ſufficient authoritie to draw and perſwade the hearers to ſubmit themſelues to it; yet conſidering the blindnes, vntowardnes, and rebelliouſnes of mans heart againſt heauenly things, a number would neuer haue ſet foote in the holie place to heare, for all the report that might haue come to their eares of the price and benefit of the glad tidings preached, if they had not been incoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and brought on by ſuch worthie examples.</p>
            <p>Oh, wee know what force there is in ſuch meanes. In ſo much, as euen with vs, howſoeuer there are of the Nobilitie, many who haue the preaching of the Goſpel in ſingular account, yet the people that dwell farre off from them, and be not ſeated neere to them, they (I ſay) hearken not after them, neither are any thing moued by them. But where ſuch are ſeene by the people that liue by them, to haue the preachers of the word in high account for the meſſage they bring, and to bee ſubiect to the holie doctrine which they teach; euen that is a ſtrong cord to draw the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour ſort to ſhew reuerence to the ordinance of God, and to cauſe them to think, that if ſuch great perſons ſo highly eſteeme of their miniſtery and meſſage, that there is (doubtleſſe) ſome great matter that moueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to it. And though that be not all, neither is of any power to conuert the heart, (for that is the proper worke of the holie Ghoſt) yet many are at the firſt brought on to receiue the preaching of the Goſpell, (who after feele the power of it alſo, and enioy the benefit of it) when yet their firſt beginnings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb facs="tcp:16609:3"/>
are chiefly occaſioned by the zeale and forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of ſuch good patternes.</p>
            <p>And this is one cauſe (Right Honourable) why we Gods Miniſters doe much wiſh and pray for the ſuperiours and great perſons, and eſpecially thoſe who are noble and growing toward the higheſt pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that they may be ſincere and zealous for the truth, becauſe, though they be no Preachers, as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Iehoſhaphats</hi> Princes were; yet wee know, how greatly they may ſet forward preaching, and honour God in going before the people in their holy courſe, I ſay, we pray that many of them may be ſuch, euen as wee highly praiſe God for thoſe, who are ſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie.</p>
            <p>And as wee are glad to ſee them fauourers and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers of that which we preach by the authoritie of God, (one father of vs all) ſo we deſire (which is the next thereto) that they would be patrons of our wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which we ſet foorth with the ſame mindes for the common edification of the Church of Chriſt, that when it is ſeene that ſuch as are in high place, and zealous profeſſors of the truth alſo, do make account of them; there may be farre greater hope that many others will doe the ſame.</p>
            <p>And therefore I humbly craue of your Honour, that I who haue preſumed to dedicate theſe few Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to your Honour, may be with your good liking allowed ſo to doe. The which though they be things of ſmall account, (as they are commonly reckoned to be) yet I would not haue offered them, if I had thought they might not promiſe that good to the Church, which I know your Honour is willing to further. Beſides, if there be any thing in them worthy
<pb facs="tcp:16609:4"/>
your accepting, and reading, they are your due, by good right, and the teſtimonie of my thankfull heart, and the beſt that I haue to preſent to your Lordſhip; who though you neuer ſaw my face, yet euen vpon report of me to your Honour, did giue me cauſe to haue you in daily remembrance while I liue. But a word is enough of this.</p>
            <p>To lay out the matter of the Sermons, I thinke it not meete to bee tedious to you about it, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the for that it is in the ſhort Epiſtle to the Reader done ſufficiently; further then thus, to ſignifie, that the thing which is chiefly aimed at in them, (among many other to good purpoſe) is to giue helpe to the Reader, as need ſhall require, to make his calling, and conſequently his election (as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth) ſure. And thus not to bee further tedious to your Lordſhip, I end, praying God, that as hee hath honoured you in a double manner, ſo he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie your earthlie honour with abundance of ſuch bleſſings as are wont to goe with it, and multiplie your beſt honour with the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie and increaſe of his heauenly graces.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian and gentle Reader, I offer to thy view in this little booke, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Sermons tending to the good of all that can finde time and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingnes to reade and regard them. And more particularlie, at this they aime; ſome of them, that they may helpe forward and perſwade ignorant, profane bad perſons, and hypocrites, to diſtaſt and waxe wearie of their euill and dangerous courſe. For out of all theſe kinds of wicked perſons doth the Lord daily call home ſome, effectually; where the Goſpell is ſoundly, plainly, and powerfully preached. And I would they ſhould know as much as I ſay, to the end they may not harden their hearts againſt God, (as they may poſsibly and eaſily doe) while they ſee many ſafely and happily guided in their liues, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues nothing ſo, but may heare his voice willingly by repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſuch wholeſome Sermons, wherein the Lord ſheweth himſelfe willing to be reconciled vnto them, and wherein he thus ſpeaketh; O nation, not worthie to be beloued, yet for all
<pb facs="tcp:16609:5"/>
this, if thou wilt returne from thine iniquitie, I will receiue thee graciouſly.</p>
            <p>And what ſhould make them like glad as the hearing of this? as the Gentiles were, when they heard firſt, that God had granted vnto them as well as to the Iewes, the glad tidings of ſaluation. Euen this ſort of people may haue no ſmall incouragement by reading theſe Sermons, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe among the reſt, which ſhew how they that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der out of the right way, may returne, and come home vnto it againe. Some of theſe Sermons doe aime at this, to keepe ſuch as are drawne out of their ſinfull courſe alreadie, to the certaintie of ſaluation, and to keepe ſuch ſtedfaſt in their faith, hope, and repentance; and that they may not fall from them. And other ſome of them, ſerue to helpe forward all ſuch ſo ſtabliſhed, that they may grow in knowledge and grace, and ſo bring foorth fruits beſeeming the Goſpell. And I would they might finde no leſſe fauour and acceptation with the readers, then I am ſure they found with them who heard them preached.</p>
            <p>I haue ſhewed what the matter is that is handled in theſe Sermons: now I will ſhew my reaſons, why I haue gathered not one, but ſundrie of the ſame argument together, and ſet them foorth ſo. And after, I will declare to thee, in what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der I place them in this treatiſe, and why.</p>
            <p>The firſt reaſon why I ſet downe many in one booke of the ſame argument, and not of diuers, is this; for that this matter and doctrine of the conuerſion of a ſinner, is very hard to be perceiued and diſcerned of many hearers, and eſpecially: ſo as they may cleerely ſee how to trace the way, and goe in it. Therefore that which could not ſo eaſily be perceiued in one ſermon, I haue thought good to lay foorth in many, and out of diuers texts of Scriptures, which ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all to this end, to wit, to ſet downe the conuerſion of a
<pb facs="tcp:16609:5"/>
ſinner to God, doe giue more light in this matter, and offer occaſion of more things about it, then one alone can doe.</p>
            <p>Theſe therefore being read with conſideration, may (through Gods bleſsing) make this point cleere, who, how, and when a man is conuerted, and make him able to trie whither he himſelfe be ſo or no. And if one be well grounded in the doctrine that teacheth this, and haue the vſe of this, he ſhall much the eaſilier attaine to further knowledge, and conſequently, to the vſe thereof: both which are meanly, and of few attained to, ſeeing ſo few are well ſetled in the other.</p>
            <p>The next reaſon of this my thus doing, is becauſe this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the conuerſion of a ſinner, is but little, and too ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome taught, I meane al the parts of it are ſeldome ſet downe together; eſpecially at one time, and in one ſermon. All which were meete to be done, and oft; the weake capacitie, ſlipperie memorie, and many other defects in the moſt hearers, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring it; and that they might ſee, both how farre they are from conuerſion, while they are in their firſt condition of ignorance, and vnbeliefe; and how they are to be brought to it, and alſo how contrarie their hearts and liues ſhould be to that they were before, when they be conuerted Theſe parts of it are ſeldome handled altogether in preaching, though one ſometime, another of them another time be taught and deliuered. But it is a long time, though the word be dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently preached (as in few places it is) before the moſt part of the hearers are able to lay one part and point of it with the other, and to make the whole worke of conuerſion of them all.</p>
            <p>And to adde the third reaſon, ſeeing all that the people know and practiſe without conuerſion is nothing, I meane, either pleaſing to God, or profitable to ſaluation vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. They may (I denie not) know many points, and learne ſundrie inſtructions, as concerning the letter, but to know

ſo as they beleeue (without which faith it is impoſsible for them to pleaſe God) they cannot without conuerſion; and to practiſe ſo in their liues, as that they may be ſaid to repent and liue holily, (without which they ſhall periſh, and neuer ſee the Lord) that is impoſsible without the ſame conuerſion.</p>
            <p>For theſe cauſes and ſome other, of which this is not the leaſt, that by experience I haue ſeene great fruit come of this doctrine diligently and much taught, and little fruite, where it hath not been much in vſe; for ſuch cauſes (I ſay) I haue of purpoſe ſet out many ſermons of this argument, deſiring that the people may be made better acquainted with it, and that ſuch Preachers as thinke me worthie to be heard in this requeſt, would frame themſelues to teach it in their owne, or in other places where they come.</p>
            <p>As for them that feare they ſhall glut the people with bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thus vpon the ſame things, as though they could preach no other, I anſwere, if wee preach to the end the people may practiſe that which we teach, and if the people alſo make vſe of that which they learne about this matter, it ſhall be found ſo hard and precious to know themſelues conuerted, that they ſhall themſelues deſire that doctrine concerning it, to be taught againe and againe, and namely of faith and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, rather then to be wearie of it; for they ſhall ſee, that when the ſame thing ſhall be taught out of new texts, euen the old matter ſhall be in manner new to them.</p>
            <p>Now it followeth to ſhew, why theſe texts are ſet downe in the order in which they are placed in the treatiſe. The firſt texts are Acts <hi>16.24.</hi> and Matth. <hi>24.12.13.</hi> and the ſermons on both, tend directly to ſhew, how a ſinner is conuerted, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the beginning of the Sermon in the <hi>16.</hi> of the Acts, which yet maketh a way to the doctrine of conuerſion in the ſtorie of the Iailer. And in thoſe two Sermons the reader may ſee the three parts of conuerſion. And diuers of the other
<pb facs="tcp:16609:6"/>
Sermons doe alſo giue good light in the ſame: and namely the <hi>5.</hi> of Deut. In the next place followeth the <hi>13.</hi> of Matth. verſ. <hi>46.</hi> and Eſay <hi>55.</hi> verſ. <hi>1.2.</hi> In the former of theſe texts is commended to the reader what an excellent thing this conuerſion and namely faith is, by a parable of the pearle: and the latter text containeth doctrine to incourage and hearten on all to thirſt after, &amp; moſt earneſtly to deſire theſe graces of faith &amp; repentance, and other graces acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panying them. The next in order is the <hi>5.</hi> of Deut. <hi>29.</hi> which, beſide that I haue ſaid of it alreadie ſetteth downe the fruit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, which is a godly conuerſation, and how liuely it flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and proceedeth from this conuerſion. The Sermons in the ſixth text, to wit, in Matth. <hi>11.</hi> verſ. <hi>20.</hi> tend to draw on and perſwade to this conuerſion, threatning woe to thoſe that conuert not. In the Sermons of the ſeuenth text in Acts <hi>9.</hi> verſ. <hi>31.</hi> there are examples, not of three perſons, but of three particular Churches, who ſhewed foorth as ſhining lights, the fruit of conuerſion in their liues, and vſed their libertie and time of reſt free from perſecution (vnder which they had liued before) to the growing in grace and knowledge with much comfort. In the laſt text, the <hi>4.</hi> to the Philippians, verſ. <hi>4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the Sermons tend to ſhew what ioy the repentant life accompanied with the fruits of amendment, doth bring to all that leade it, and are conuerted, notwithſtanding the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements that are on euery ſide againſt them. I haue ſaid now what I minded to do: that which remaineth, is this. The Lord make that which I ſet out to thee, with all other holy inſtruction, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to thee for the making thee trulie happie.</p>

                  <p>Now at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and ſung Pſalmes vnto God: and the priſoners heard them.</p>

                  <p>And ſuddenly there was a great earthquake, ſo that the foundation of the priſon was ſhaken: and by and by all the doores opened, and euery mans bands were looſſed.</p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="27"/>
                  <p>Then the keeper of the priſon waked out of his ſleepe, and when he ſaw the priſon doores open, he drew out his ſword and would haue killed himſelfe, ſuppoſing the priſoners had been fled.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Scripture there are two things to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; the one,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The vnfolding of the text.</hi>
                  </note> the behauiour of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> in the priſon; the other the conuerſion of the Iayler. Of the firſt, I will ſay no more,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The parts two.</hi>
                  </note> then may make way and giue light to the ſecond. The occaſion hereof
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:16609:8"/>
was this, that <hi>Paul</hi> hauing caſt the diuell out of a maid that had been poſſeſſed thereof, and ſo had thereby diſabled her from bringing in gaine to her maſters by diuining and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of things to come, whereby they had gotten much: they beholding what <hi>Paul</hi> had done, and how he had ſitten in their light thereby; they forthwith like mad men, drew <hi>Paul</hi> into the market place vnto the Magiſtrates, accuſing him that he with <hi>Silas</hi> had troubled the citie.</p>
               <p>And by meanes thereof, the people roſe vp againſt them, and the Gouernours commanded them to be beaten with rods, which, when they had done, they caſt them into priſon, commanding the Iailer to keepe them ſurely. He caſt them into the dungeon or inward priſon, and made their feet faſt in the ſtockes. This was the occaſion of theſe words, as it is plainly ſet downe by Saint <hi>Luke</hi> in the words going before; and then he ſheweth how <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> behaued them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, being thus cruelly and tumultuouſly handled, as grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous malefactors, when all may ſee not onely their innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, but alſo the good, charitable and godly worke, which they did ſhew on the maid.</p>
               <p>It is ſaid, that they receiuing this iniurie at their hands pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently, and being ſtrangers, and ſo finding no helpe at mans hands, did ſhew, what account and fauour they were in with God, in that he did not forſake them in their diſtreſſe; but comforted them by his Spirit in token of the goodneſſe of their cauſe, and made them able to teſtifie the ioy of their hearts by ſinging Pſalmes of thanks to God, declaring there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by that they being innocent, though they ſuffered as euill do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, yet reioyced in the Lord, that they were counted worthy to ſuffer for well doing. And this be ſaid of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, to ſpeake of the Iailer, who was one of them that had his hand among the reſt of that barbarous company, and was readie to execute the cruell commandement of thoſe Gouernours, and that alſo with more rigour then he needed haue done; it is very ſpecially to be marked how God dealt with him, to make him ſee his rigourous and vnconſcionable handling of his good ſeruants, by caſting a feare vpon him that made him deſperate: and not only ſo, but ſhewed him
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:16609:8"/>
mercie by them whom he had vſed cruelly, ſo that he was conuerted both from that, and from all other his wicked waies, in ſo ſtrange a manner, that it rang all the citie ouer, that all the reſt of them that had been partakers in that odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fact againſt Gods faithfull ſeruants, might be prouoked by his example, to turne from their wickedneſſe alſo.</p>
               <p>But as I ſaid,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The ſfirst part: The behauiour of Paul and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las in priſon: wherein three things are to be conſidered.</hi>
                  </note> my meaning is not to ſtand largely vpon both theſe parts of the text. Noting therefore two or three points in the firſt, I will lay forth the conuerſion of the Iailer more particularly and fully afterwards, which is the ſecond. The things which I haue thought good to ſhew and lay downe in the firſt part, are three. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt is of God, comforting and taking part with his deare children in their trouble. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> and the ioyfulneſſe of them in their ſuffering for well doing. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third is of the wicked Iailer, and what he gained in the end by his crueltie (God terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him deadly by the earthquake) how bold and vnrulie ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer he was in the beginning.</p>
               <p>Concerning the firſt, namely, Gods dealing with his,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>First: that God ſtandeth by his ſeruants in their troubles.</hi>
                  </note> we may ſee in this Scripture, that he doth not bring his ſeruants into the briars, I meane great dangers, and then leaue them to ſhift for themſelues how they can, as the manner of the diuell is to do, as alſo his inſtruments do, which learne of him. But God vpholdeth and comforteth them in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thereof, when a man which looketh but to the outward face of things, would ſay, they are deſolate, they are vndone and vtterly forſaken. This is a point that may be clearly ſeene heere, as it were in a glaſſe, for <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were brought into many and ſore perils for doing their dutie, and for ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the diuell out of the poſſeſſed maid; all the citie both Gouernours and people were againſt them, ſo that after ſcourging they were caſt into priſon, vntill further ſentence ſhould be giuen vpon them. They found no friends in the place: what ſhould I ſay? they might (a man would haue thought) ſeuerally haue cried out, and haue made that woful complaint, which the Prophet made in the anguiſh of his ſoule, ſaying: <hi>there is no griefe like to my griefe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lament. 1.12.</note> And how farre were they off in mans iudgement, from that woe, which is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:16609:9"/>
not euery woe,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 4.10.</note> when it is ſaid, <hi>woe to him that is alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But heere we muſt looke vp higher, and lift vp the eyes of our minds, and behold whether God be abſent from them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, or againſt them as all men were. But we ſee that to be far otherwiſe: for we behold him ſo readie and preſent at hand, that it might haue been ſaid by him which had a good eye, of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> as <hi>Eliſha</hi> ſaid to his ſeruant full of feare, when armies of the Aramites were about the houſe to take him,<note place="margin">2. King. 6.16.</note> 
                  <hi>that they had more with them then against them.</hi> So the Lord being with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> what hurt could they all do to them, who were againſt them? And that was ſo apparent, that whereas men lying in priſon are commonly filled with deadly ſorrow, and are at their wits end; theſe were in the middeſt of ioy; in ſo much that they expreſſed the ſame by ſinging a Pſalme.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 12.11. Dan. 6.22.</note>Euen as he did accompanie <hi>Peter</hi> with an Angell in the like condition, and was preſent with <hi>Daniel</hi> in the Lions den, ſo he was with <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> at this time. So that though Satan comming firſt as a tempter to allure to ſinne, commeth afterward as an accuſer,<note place="margin">Matth. 27.</note> to condemne for ſinning: and although the high Prieſts toled <hi>Iudas</hi> with money and faire allurements to betray his Maſter; but when he being wounded in his conſcience for his ſo doing, brought the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney againe to them, and complaining in what diſtreſſe he was; they left him in the ſnare, and bad him ſhift for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; yet the Lord doth not ſo to his.</p>
               <p>But if they ſuffer hardnes for his ſake, and at his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, yet that may be verified in them, which is written by the Apoſtle,<note place="margin">2. Cor. <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.8. and 6.10.</note> though they be afflicted on euery ſide, yet they are not in diſtreſſe nor forſaken; and though they ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the world, yet they alwayes reioyce to God-ward: and though they haue nothing in their penurie; yet they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſe all things by contentation. And euen when they feele it not, by reaſon of their weake faith, yet it is with them as it was with <hi>Gedeon,</hi> when great heauineſſe was vpon him, the Angell of God ſaying to him,<note place="margin">Iudg. 6.12.</note> 
                  <hi>God is with thee thou valiant man.</hi> This is the condition of Gods people, ſo that as he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his preſence to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> euen in the deep and darke
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:16609:9"/>
priſon, ſo doth he to all that truſt in him, in what affliction ſoeuer.</p>
               <p>Let all ſuch reioyce, ſaith he in the Pſalme,<note place="margin">Pſalme 5.11.</note> who knew it ſo well, yea let them triumph for euer, yea let them that loue thy name (O Lord) reioyce: for in what weake eſtate ſoeuer they be,<note place="margin">Pſalme 3.4.</note> he is their buckler to defend them from their ſtrongeſt enemies, and when they be moſt contemptible, yet they may be bold to beleeue it, and to profeſſe their faith and ſay, they are in honorable account with him. And wheras it is deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, why then are they ſo caſt downe in their troubles, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maied and vncomfortable. It is (I anſwere) all long of this,<note place="margin">Iohn 20.25.</note> that they faile in beleeuing, as <hi>Thomas</hi> did, becauſe he ſaw not with bodily eyes Chriſt Ieſus in preſence; but when their faith is ſet on worke, then appeare they more then conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, for by it only they preuaile, according to the Apoſtles words; <hi>This is the victorie that ouercommeth the world,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Iohn 5.4.</note> 
                  <hi>euen your faith.</hi> And this of the firſt point, namely how God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaketh not his in their trouble, but ſtandeth by them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d point. How Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in their troubles.</hi>
                  </note> how the godly are affected in their ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings (vnleſſe they forget themſelues, and faile through their owne default) and that is as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were, I meane ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and comfortable. No otherwiſe need they be minded, if they did duely conſider their libertie; nay I ſay more, if they did well weigh the commandement of the Lord, which is,<note place="margin">Phil. 4.4.</note> that they ſhould do ſo. For thus he ſaith: <hi>reioyce in the Lord alwaies</hi> (and therefore in tribulation) and leſt he ſhould be thought to ſpeake raſhly, and not well aduiſed, he doubleth his words, ſaying, <hi>againe I ſay, reioyce.</hi> Which commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment if it were obeyed, they might find a great part of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (that I may ſpeake to their full comfort) more then they do<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heere vpon the earth.</p>
               <p>But as it is truly ſaid of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> that they ſung for ioy when their feet were pinned in the ſtockes, and that alſo in the inward priſon; and ſo of <hi>Dauid</hi> the Scripture affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that when he was in ieopardie of death,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 30.6.</note> 
                  <hi>he comforted himſelfe in his God</hi>; ſo there is no let or cauſe on Gods behalfe, why it ſhould not be ſo now with the reſt of his deare chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; he could willingly afford it them. But as it commeth
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:16609:10"/>
to paſſe, that the things that are moſt precious, are alſo rare; ſo in this one it is moſt true, that as comfort in affliction, and ſpecially in the greateſt, is more worth and more to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted of, then gold or the beſt earthly treaſure; ſo is it alſo more hard to be found and enioyed.</p>
               <p>How great was the glorie of it in the Martyrs, the Aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries themſelues being iudges, and in others that in grieuous paines and ſickneſſe lie comfortable and ioyfull? And ſo ſhould it be ſtill, if it were more regarded and better looked to.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Why troubles are ſo vnwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to vs.</hi>
                  </note> But in that it is not ſo, what other reaſon can be alleaged of it, but this, that the Lord vſing his, to a more liberall and full diet, and giuing them more varietie of earthly benefits; they find ſuch ſweetnes and ſauour in them, that when wants come or other hardſhip, they are more hardly borne, and ſtooped to: (euen as children daintily brought vp, cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with bare and courſe commons.) Eſpecially if this be added, that becauſe they are not much encumbred with afflictions, and thoſe that they haue laid on them, be not ſore nor grieuous; therefore when any come vpon them of any waight indeed, they caſt them off, as impatient in bearing the burthen.</p>
               <p>

                     <hi>As our outward troubles are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ſo are our bleſſings alſo.</hi>
                  </note> For notwithſtanding this; many are their outward bleſſings alſo, eſpecially where the pure preaching of the Goſpell is enioyed: for many troubles may be eaſily ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp, where that is, to helpe to digeſt them. And yet what poore and weake commendation may be giuen of the ioyfull welcoming of the troubles which are ſent to ſuch for the moſt part? And this to be true which I ſay, thoſe times do proue, wherein they haue ſome load of affliction laid vpon them, for what earneſt ſeeking to God is in them, or patience to beare them? Indeed, if they continue, or waxe more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, ſo that they can neither auoid them, neither is there any hope of earthly helpe left vnto them, to come out of them: then perhaps, and not till then for the moſt part, when they ſee no other remedy, it may be ſeene, that God is ſought
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:16609:10"/>
vnto ſeriouſly, and then they ſtirre vp their faith to lay hold of aſſiſtance from God with ſome confidence, when all other helpe faileth.</p>
               <p>For example, when by ſome ſore viſitation and ſickneſſe, that is like to be vnto death, God awaketh any of his, (the diſeaſe permitting and giuing libertie to the partie afflicted, for ſome ſickneſſe is more violent then other,) it may be ſeene ſometime, that he lieth more like vnto one that preacheth, and giueth encouragement and exhortation to repentance ioyfully; rather then as one readie to die: but how rare is this to ſee? for in many ſmaller troubles, perhaps patience will hardly be found. And whereas ſome of Gods corrections cauſe ſorrow only to the afflicted, without paine to the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, as the loſſe of friends or goods; ſome cauſe ſorrow that commeth from paine, as ſickneſſe and grieuous diſeaſes: it may be that the former may worke ſome good now or then; but for the moſt part, the latter (if extremitie hinder not) leaue the beſt fruit behind them.</p>
               <p>Howſoeuer it be, there is no doubt, but that this grace is too much wanting, and the rather it is the leſſe ſought, ſeeing we leane too much to temporarie holds and ſtayes, and for that our hearts runne after earthly things inordinately, as health, riches, peace, &amp;c. though we ſee by long experience, that there is no hold of them, nor any ſafe reſting in them. And this lingring heere like <hi>Lots</hi> wife,<note place="margin">Gen. 19.26.</note> muſt be purged out of vs and chaſed from vs, or elſe we ſhall degenerate from the faithfull in former ages, and ſhew too truely, that we be not led with their ſpirit, when we being ſo neſtled heere, can ſo hardly go out of our ſelues, to welcome the troubles which God ſendeth to weane vs from hence, and do not rather pray that we may reioyce vnder them, and be thankfull in them.</p>

               <p>His eſtate before he was turned to God was wicked, as all other mens is: but more laid out in three things, by which we may the eaſilier iudge of his whole life beſides. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> And theſe were his crueltie againſt <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> his deſperatenes in his affliction, minding to haue killed himſelfe, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent his ſenſuality and drunkenneſſe in his proſperity while he enioyed it.</p>
               <p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The meanes of his conuerſion were, partly more remote and further off: partly more neere vnto it. And both of them are ſeuerally three. Of the firſt ſort was the earthquake, whereby he was aſtoniſhed and terrified: then <hi>Pauls</hi> words diſſwading him from hurting himſelfe: and thirdly, how they wrought vpon him, and that was ſo farre, as that they turned his heart toward them, and he ſought to be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of them. All theſe did ſet him forward, though afarre off, to his conuerſion: in ſo much as, although they wrought it not, yet without theſe he had neuer come to the other, which were more neere meanes thereof, and did effect it. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter kind of meanes were alſo three. Firſt, he deſired to know of them how he might be ſaued. Secondly <hi>Pauls</hi> anſwere, that he muſt beleeue.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The effects and fruits of his conuerſion follow, and they were alſo three, which were proofes of it.

                     <hi>The estate of the Iailer before his conuerſion.</hi>
                  </note>Now, according to the parts of this ſtorie, I will proceed to ſpeake of euery one in order. And firſt, to begin with the eſtate that he was in before his conuerſion, ſomewhat is to be noted of it in generall, and then his particular ſinnes are to be conſidered. Generally, this is to be obſerued, that he being prophane,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2 12. and 4.17.</note> and (as he ſhewed himſelfe) ignorant, and <hi>without God in the world</hi>; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of all the Gentiles, I ſay, it is to be obſerued, how vile and wretched we are before God ſhew his worke of mercie vpon vs: euen filthie and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane, ſtinking in our ſinnes, loathſome to God, and euen to men alſo, who are themſelues any better guided and graced.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:16609:12"/>The which to be true, the ſaying of <hi>Ezechiel</hi> doth moſt cleerely ſhew: who bringeth God in to ſpeake thus, with many other words to the like purpoſe, <hi>When I paſſed by thee,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ezech. 16.6.</note> 
                  <hi>I ſaw thee polluted in thine owne blood; in thy natiuitie when thou wast borne thy nauell was not cut, thou wast not waſhed in water to ſoften thee: thou wast not ſalted with ſalt, no eye pitied thee,</hi> &amp;c. ſhewing hereby, that before God waſh vs and giue life to vs, there is nothing but filthineſſe and death. Thus the Scripture <hi>brandeth</hi> the woman of Samaria,<note place="margin">Iohn 4.18.</note> (though ſhe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward brought many to Chriſt) with a note of infamie, that ſhe had been an harlot; that ſhe had been full of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, maliciouſneſſe, a ſcorner, &amp;c. And <hi>Zacheus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 19.7.8.</note> though his repentance was famous, had been a ſore griper and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and <hi>Paul</hi> had been <hi>a perſecuter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Tim. 1.13.</note> 
                  <hi>a blasphemer and an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſuch a miſerable perſon was this Iailer. For though there was no direct occaſion offered to Saint <hi>Luke</hi> to lay out his whole wicked courſe; yet by the few ſinnes that were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſely mentioned to haue been in him, or by neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, it may be eaſily gathered that he was ſuch an one: which ſins ſeeing they were ſetled in him by long cuſtome, as habites and courſes of life, they did both rule him, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo drew many like companions to them, to make him a vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall and ſlaue of the diuell. And ſo it is with all, though all breake not forth into the ſame notorious euils.</p>
               <p>Well might the Prophet <hi>Ieremie</hi> therefore ſay,<note place="margin">Lament. 3.22.</note> it is the Lords mercie that we liue and breath, and are not vtterly conſumed. And all may wonder that he will pitie vs, and be patient toward vs, in giuing vs a time of repentance: as they that beleeue do when they find it ſo, and it ſhould humble the proudeſt, and ſhame and feare them that are not ſo; euen as it houldeth all in lowlines and abaſement euer after, who haue found from him a gracious deliuerance out of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable bondage. And the vſe that ſhould be made of the very knowledge of this miſerable condition of man, is no leſſe then I haue ſet downe, euen as humble and thankefull walking with God ought alwaies to accompanie thoſe who haue eſcaped it, as I haue ſaid.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:16609:13"/>But alas, though there may be ſeene ſome ſuch dutie to be practiſed of the latter, I meane the faithfull; yet no ſparke of ſhame or ſorrow for ſo great calamity can be perceiued to be in the former, that is, the vngodly: in ſo much that a man would thinke there were no ſuch vengeance hanging ouer them as I ſpeake of, if he ſhould marke the looſeneſſe, bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſecuritie of ſuch; and neither any damnation wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them, either old or yong, men or women: when (yet) it is the ſenſeleſſenes of them through vnbeliefe, that they gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing no credit to the Scriptures, which in euerie place doe proue it to be ſo; therefore they feare nothing, no not the greateſt woe, till it come vpon them, and that they feele it.

And although this ſin be not expreſſely ſaid to haue been in him, yet by neceſſarie conſequence, it is gathered to haue been ſo, by a reaſon drawne from contraries: for whoſoeuer is deſperate in his loſſes, and is brought to his wits end for the ſame, he (doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe)

               <p>And what place is there for inſtruction in ſuch? This ſinne is called <hi>the pride of life</hi>;<note place="margin">1.

And by theſe three ſins we may gather, what the Iailer was in the whole courſe of his life, in which theſe three bare ſway, and other ſinnes which did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie them.

               <p>Oh therefore, what hope was there either of him, that he might be made a Chriſtian, or of other like vnto him, to be brought backe from ſuch a diſguiſed eſtate?

in that mire, after they be waſhed; neither can they in a long time be pacified nor quiet in themſelues afterward, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what manner of perſons, and how vile and odious they haue been.

                  </note> Of thoſe which were further off, this was the firſt, that the Lord ſent a mightie earthquake, whereby he awaked him, and ſeeing the priſon doores opened; ſuch aſtoniſhment and feare of the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming away of the priſoners tooke hold of him, that he was at the point to haue killed himſelfe. <label type="milestone">

                  </label> But what of this, ſome man (perhaps) will ſay? was this a meane to conuert him, and to bring him thereby toward ſaluation? when all may ſee that there was (as one may ſay) little more then a haires breadth betweene him and vtter confuſion and deſolation by killing himſelfe, whereto he was fully bent, and hardly held backe. <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> Whereto I anſwere, that he was held back from that attempt by the prouidence of God, who had prouided and ſet in a readineſſe there, not his wife or familiar friend to keepe him, but euen <hi>Paul,</hi> to whom he was a deadly enemie, that he might be a meane to ſaue his life, rather then that he ſhould miſcarie. And for the other part of the obiection, whether that deſperateneſſe of his, was a meane of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, I ſay, it was (though a farre off) as God handled the matter.</p>
               <p>For by this ſhaking and fearing him, his iollity was abated,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:16609:16"/>
his pride allayed, and he was, though not tamed, yet in a good way to it, and well prepared for it, as appeareth by that which followeth, when this was added thereto, that <hi>Paul</hi> had ſo kindly diſſwaded him from hurting himſelfe, and in ſo fit a ſeaſon. And as we ſay in the prouerbe, that ſometime the furtheſt way about is the neereſt way home; ſo by Gods good hand it was in this; that the trouble and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetling of him, that was like to haue ſent him to hell, the Lord vſed as a meane of his conuerſion and ſaluation. There is no doubt, but that many felt the earthquake, as well as he, and yet neuer were the better for it, as he was; neither ſhould he haue been, but that the Lord intended and purpoſed it.</p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doctrine</hi>
                  </note>And heere we may learne, that God goeth about to doe them good who are his vtter enemies, when they little dreame of any ſuch thing; and hee entendeth their good, when they neither obſerue nor conſider it. To ſpeake more particularly, in ſending croſſes, ſickneſſe and ſundrie viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, men at the firſt do in their raſhneſſe and haſte, rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God and curſe him; whereby they ſhew, that this is all the good that they can draw out of them. But if the Lord do intend and meane their good by ſending them, he will pull downe their ſtomackes, and make them ſee themſelues thereby, and how little they ſhall gaine by ſetting vp their briſtles againſt him. Yea he will make them glad of the helpe and counſell of ſuch, as they did before both ſcorne and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre,<note place="margin">1. Sam. 24.17.</note> as in the example of <hi>Saul</hi> we may ſee, who for all his loftineſſe and iollitie, was caſt downe, as they who are moſt meane and miſerable; and full glad of <hi>Dauids</hi> kindneſſe to him.</p>
               <p>This bridling of the rage of wicked men, and breaking of their hearts by afflictions, though it be not repentance, yet God vſeth them as meanes to bring them thereto in time and by degrees; I ſpeake this of ſuch as the Lord will honor and do good vnto. And they that do well weigh it, ſhall ſee, that it may well be ſo. For as they who will make crooked things ſtraight, do bow them a contrarie way, that ſo they may the eaſilier bring them betwixt both, which is to be ſtraight and right: ſo the Lord, when he entends to make a proud man
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:16609:16"/>
humble and meeke, he will breake his heart with ſorrow and affliction, wherewith when hee hath been throughly exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he is the fitter to be brought to the meane betwixt both, that is, broken-heartednes and humilitie.</p>
               <p>For as a log in the deepe mire, hauing long lien therein is ſo faſtened to the place, as it is impoſſible to remoue or pluck it out, vnleſſe it be looſened and turned into another place; but being ſo handled, it may with eaſe be taken out: Euen ſo, if a man ſet vpon his dregges, I meane, being riuited into his ſinnes, be not looſened from them by ſome terrour and heart-ſmart, though hee be brought neuer the neerer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance thereby, yet he ſhall (if he be ſuch a one as God wil ſhew mercie vnto) hee ſhall (I ſay) much more eaſily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded thereto. According to that which wee ſay in our common ſpeech, and that truly, of a wicked man bent to his will and to liue licentiouſly, that hee is neuer like to amend and come to good, vnleſſe the Lord awake him by ſome great affliction.</p>
               <p>This manner of Gods dealing with men, to bring them to ſo happie an eſtate by ſo vnlikely meanes, and ſo farre off, ſhould teach the men of this age, that wiſedome, hauing knowledge, which the ignorant cannot learne, that in their troubles and aſtoniſhments, they ſhould not think that they are puniſhed ſeeing God taketh delight therein; and ſo wax hardened: but to know, that they not humbling their hearts to ſeeke the Lord by preaching, and by Gods bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, they haue need to be awaked by his iudgements, and that he doth therefore afflict them, that they may know they are farre gone in their euill courſe, that ſo they may lay ſurer hold of his word, and take direction and counſell from thence, to be brought to God.</p>
               <p>But let vs ſee how God wrought by the ſecond meane that was farre off, and ſo, how hee brought him on by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees to true conuerſion.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The ſecond meane: Pauls care of his life.</hi>
                  </note> This ſecond meane was <hi>Pauls</hi> care of him in his deſperate eſtate, to hinder and diſſwade him from offering violence to himſelfe, and his kindnes towards him, in <hi>ouercomming euill with good.</hi> For whereas the Iaylor had ſhewed himſelfe cruell towards him,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.21.</note> when he had giuen
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:16609:17"/>
him no cauſe ſo to doe, and therefore looked for no good will at his hands (if poſſibly he ſhould ſtand in neuer ſo great need thereof) behold hee had no greater friend then him, whom he had deſerued to be his greateſt enemie: for euen by him was his life preſerued.</p>
               <p>This when he weighed and conſidered, which hee could not but ſee, <hi>Paul</hi> ſo earneſtly beſeeching him to doe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe no harme, who had not otherwiſe been held back from killing himſelfe, I ſay, when he laid theſe things together, he was againe amazed at this, but in another manner and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then before. For before, his heart was troubled deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratly, thinking what loſſe he was like to haue; but now hee was moued in a more commendable manner, to ſee <hi>Pauls</hi> vnlooked for kindnes towards him. This began to draw his heart towards <hi>Paul</hi>; which (we know) muſt needs be a great change, from that which was before.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The beautie of vertue &amp; grace in Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</hi>
                  </note>And by this we may mark the beautie of vertue and grace in Gods ſeruants, how greatly it moueth the hearts euen of wicked men. Surely, if they were carefull that their light might ſhine in good conuerſation among men, they ſhould not a little prouoke them out of their bad courſe, and to bee in loue with a better. I doe not denie but it moſt moueth them, when it bringeth any benefit to them, as heere <hi>Pauls</hi> loue and care did to the Iaylor: they had double force to worke vpon him. And although it helpe much (I grant) to the further drawing him on toward goodneſſe, yet that only was not to be ſeene in him, but that did beate into him a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion, that he was a good man, and was able to doe him good alſo, and therefore a little after he deſired to know of him how he might be ſaued.</p>
               <p>So that kindnes and harmeleſnes, and other fruits of loue, if they were more vſually and plentifully ſhewed foorth by Chriſtians, they would (vndoubtedly) pearce the hearts of many wicked men, and cauſe them to thinke that they are farre from the courſe which they ſhould walk in. For though many ſcorners and profane perſons doe trample goodneſſe and good men vnder their feete; yet the beautie of pietie and Chriſtianitie doth much moue and auaile with many. As
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:16609:17"/>
we ſee by <hi>Peters</hi> words to Chriſtian women, where he ſaith: <hi>Let the wiues be ſubiect to their huſbands,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Pet. 3.1.</note> 
                  <hi>that euen they that obey not the word, may without the word be wonne by the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of their wiues.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But eſpecially, if Gods ſeruants would, as opportunitie is offered, ſhew their loue in ſeeking to win them to God, and to help them towards eternall life; much more ſhould they perſwade them to forſake their bad courſe, and to embrace a better. As our Sauiour Chriſt talking with that woman of Samaria, brought her to repentance.<note place="margin">Iohn 4.</note> And this be ſaid of the ſecond meane of the conuerſion of the Iaylor, though farre off: which as it was a degree before the former, ſo they who are moued as hee was, are ſenſiblie ſet forward, as he was; though I denie not, but that many comming thus farre, and further from their euill courſe, may yet be farre enough off from true conuerſion.</p>
               <p>But let vs heare the third meane,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The third meane: His cleauing to the Apoſtles.</hi>
                  </note> which the ſecond now ſpoken of, procured and brought foorth: and that is a neerer degree to goodneſſe, then the former. And this it is, that he conceiued ſo well of them, of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> I meane, that for all the commandement of the Magiſtrate, hee brought them out of the priſon, and fell downe before them, in token of reuerence to them, and ſo fell to neere acquaintance with them, who being good men, it gaue hope of his further good taking by them. And here I will ſtay a while to teach how we may profit by this.</p>
               <p>To this end, this I ſay,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The benefit of familiaritie with Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</hi>
                  </note> that as his neere clinging and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to them, was another meane to bring him to true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion; euen ſo God vſeth the familiaritie and acquaintance that wicked men haue with his ſeruants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to this end, that they may diſtaſte their former courſe, and bring them to heare the word preached, and ſo in time to be changed. Thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny become beleeuers in Chriſt, by companie and acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with Preachers; who being appointed by Chriſt to be <hi>fiſhers of men,</hi> doe ſhew the loue to them,<note place="margin">Matth. 4.19.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For although many of that profeſſion, I meane the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, be blinde themſelues in the myſterie of ſaluation, and others who haue knowledge in the letter, yet for want of loue are vnprofitable, and rather puffed vp with their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, then carefull to doe good with it, to the perſwading of men to faith thereby: yet they whom God hath trulie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, doe farre otherwiſe. For they hauing daily before their eyes the words of the Lord Ieſus,<note place="margin">Iohn 21.15.</note> that <hi>as they loue him they ſhould feed his lambes and his ſheepe</hi>; and againe, <hi>that they who turne many to righteouſnes,</hi>

               <p>And the people who conuerſe with ſuch, if they be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to ſaluation, ſhall embrace ſuch kindnes offered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and how farre off ſoeuer they haue been from the aſſurance of it, and from true godlineſſe, yet, by good inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and example, they ſhall moſt readily looke after both. And thus God wrought in the Iaylor, and thus he worketh in many. As examples hereof are many in the booke of the Acts of the Apoſtles, where <hi>Paul</hi> trauelled among the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant nations; ſo I can truly ſay, vpon mine owne remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance almoſt fortie yeeres agone, (and yet in thoſe times the light of the Goſpell ſhined nothing ſo cleerely as it hath done ſince) that by familiar companying betwixt the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſter of God and the ignorant people, the Lord wrought wonderfully and mightily amongſt them. And I am ſure the fruit of the Goſpell that hath been ſince in thoſe parts, (that I ſay no more) and that is to be ſeene at this day, did flow from that well-ſpring, and had the beginning there. The Lord did bleſſe weake meanes, when they were vſed in ſimplicitie, and that in admirable manner, when the ſubtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the wicked was not yet at thoſe times growne to ſuch an height, to diſmay the people in their firſt beginnings. But ſince thoſe daies, ſome of them, though ſeeking to grow vp
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:16609:18"/>
in further meaſure of knowledge and grace, and to bring on others by their example, haue met with ſuch diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they haue not anſwered (I ſpeake not of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons) as many other haue done, to the hope that they gaue ſo long before, by many degrees.</p>
               <p>But while I ſhew how the Iaylor and many other haue taken ſo great good by the companie and fellowſhip of Gods ſeruants, it is not to be paſſed by,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Many that may enioy this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, looke not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it.</hi>
                  </note> how little vſe many make of ſuch good meanes now a daies. Who although they dwel neere godly Preachers, yea and are readie enough in ciuill manner to haue their conuerſing with them, yet in things pertaining to God and to eternall life, they haue no appetite to them. Which I ſpeake to their ſhame, ſeeing ſo much good might be gotten thereby. For what though they dwel neere ſuch, and haue thereby acquaintance with them, yet many further off, ſeeking heartily to take good by them, are in farre better caſe, and ſhew themſelues farre wiſer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their deſire is farre greater to benefit themſelues by them.</p>

For this was the thing which he ſtood in need of, and that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the which he could not be ſaued. For hee being alreadie throughly troubled in his conſcience, needed not to bee vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſorrow and prick of heart, fearing damnation alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die for his horrible ſinnes; but had need of comfort rather through the forgiuenes thereof, which hee could no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe obtaine, but by faith. And therefore they required this of him, namely, that he ſhould beleeue in the Lord Ieſus for the remiſſion of his ſinnes, rather then any other thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hauing this, the <hi>loue of Chriſt</hi> which hee ſhould ſee thereby towards him, <hi>would conſtraine him,</hi> ſooner then any thing elſe, to ſet vpon, and endeuour after the doing of his will, which is repentance.</p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Faith is not in our power, but the free gift of God.</hi>
                  </note>Neither let any here gather by this, that it was in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to beleeue, faith being the free gift of God, but it was neceſſarie that hee ſhould know ſo much, namely, that hee muſt beleeue, to the end he might both be the better prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to aske and learne of them how hee ſhould come to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine it, and alſo eſteeme more highly and preciouſly of it, which is the next way to come by it. This point is the more to be marked, becauſe that which I haue ſaid of the Apoſtles words to him, muſt without any further labour, be receiued and applied to all that are in the ſame eſtate that he was in.</p>
               <p>For (to make this former expoſition of their words to ſerue alſo for doctrine) what is needfull for any which are as the Iaylor was, terrified and troubled with the feare of hell, and ſtricken with the wound of conſcience for their ſinnes; I ſay, what is needfull to ſuch in any ſort, like vnto this, that they ſhould know they are all waſhed away by the blood of Chriſt? which is all one as to beleeue in him, that

he hath pardoned them.<note place="margin">Luke 19.10.</note> For to ſuch as ſo feele themſelues loſt, is the promiſe made, ſo that they beleeue not before the time, but haue good leaue and libertie from God ſo to do, neither therefore ought they to neglect or refuſe ſo to doe, while they feele what need and deſire they haue of it. And this be ſaid of the Apoſtles anſwere, which was the ſecond meane of the Iailers conuerſion, more neare.</p>
               <p>The third followeth, which was their preaching of the word of God vnto him, whereby he was brought to beleeue,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The third: Their preaching of the word of God vnto him.</hi>
                  </note> and ſo to be conuerted. Heere for the clearing of this point, becauſe it is not particularly expreſſed what doctrine they preached, but only in generall, the word of God, it need not trouble any, what the things were which they taught; for ſeeing it is ſaid afterward, that he beleeued, it is manifeſt, that they preached of ſuch points to him as might worke and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get faith in him. And ſeeing he was alreadie terrified, and full of anguiſh for that he ſaw himſelfe in the eſtate of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is certaine, that they told him that he was in the way to receiue mercie.</p>
               <p>And it is alſo out of doubt, that they preached this,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>What things they taught him out of the word.</hi>
                  </note> that Ieſus Chriſt came into the world to ſaue ſuch as (in the caſe in which he was) were void of all other hope. And that they taught him to applie wiſely and kindly his merits, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remedie and medicine fit to heale his deadly and running ſore: and that they heartened and encouraged him in Chriſts name, to lay hold of the ſame, and to beleeue and to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that he was giuen and ſent into the world of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to ſaue and deliuer from endleſſe thraldome and woe, ſuch miſerable ſinners; and alſo that they anſwered his obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, namely, that he doubted he came not to ſaue ſuch great ſinners as he was, and ſuch like. For this is the doctrine that he had need to be throughly inſtructed in, and furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, and all to this end, that he might be bold to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it.</p>
               <p>Thus they preaching vnto him, and confirming in him that which he had, namely, the deſire he had in that heauie eſtate of his, to be ſaued; and helping him to that which he had not, that is, the promiſe of eternall life; God ſo wrought
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:16609:21"/>
in him thereby, that he embraced it, and reſted vpon it by faith, ſo that he, euen he appeared then, to be one of them for whom Chriſt died, and whom he came to ſaue: according to that which is ſaid by the Apoſtle, <hi>faith commeth by hearing of the word of God</hi> preached:<note place="margin">Rom. 10.17. verſ. 10.</note> and againe, <hi>with the heart man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeueth vnto righteouſneſſe,</hi> and conſequently to ſaluation. To that doctrine they (I meane <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi>) added alſo this, that he which beleeueth,<note place="margin">1. Iohn 3.3.</note> and hath the hope that maketh not aſhamed, purgeth himſelfe alſo from the ſinne that he findeth in himſelfe, that as he is made the adopted ſonne of God, ſo he endeuoureth to reſemble his father in purity, of the which more ſhall be ſaid afterwards by a fitter occaſion. And this of their preaching.</p>
               <p>And this which I haue ſaid of the preaching of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> to the Iailer, doth likewiſe inſtruct vs, that the ſame doctrine is to be preached to all ſuch as are in his caſe, and they muſt know it, who heare; that if at any time God exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe them, as he did him, with a troubled conſcience for their ſinne, and an vnfained deſire to be ſaued, they may long for the ſame promiſe of life, and as they ſee what need they haue of it, may be readie to embrace it, and by faith to reſt vpon it, that ſo all teares may be wiped from the cheekes of their ſoule, and they may be ſoundly comforted, or at leaſt ſtayed for the time, as their weakneſſe will permit.</p>
               <p>For this is the firſt and eſpeciall fruit of preaching to ſuch as groane vnder the burthen of their ſinne, and lament after God, longing for pardon: there is nothing able to eaſe their conſciences and to giue reſt to their ſoules, beſides this, namely, that they beleeue that Ieſus Chriſt is as readie to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe them of their ſinnes, as they be deſirous of it, and that they hold this as confidently, as they beleeue any article of their faith.<label type="milestone">

                  </label> But the chiefe difficultie about this matter is, to be fit and prepared for this faith, that is, to feele indeed that they ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in need of it.

                  </note> it was more then common and ordinarie in the moſt hearers, that he ſo ſoone and eaſily beleeued in Chriſt, that is to ſay, while they preached to him. For although faith come by hearing, yet it is not alwayes attained at the time of hearing, eſpecially in ſuch a meaſure that a man can affirme and profeſſe, that he beleeueth, and ſo is able to crie Abba,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.15.</note> that is, to call God Father, No nor immediately after neither, for the moſt part, doth a broken hearted ſinner receiue ſuch light to beleeue; but is holden in doubting and feare, and troubled with the greatneſſe of his ſinnes, and with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obiections. For though <hi>Lydia, Zaccheus,</hi> and ſome other,<note place="margin">Act. 16.15. Luke 19.8.</note> by Chriſts and the Apoſtles preaching beleeued by and by; yet with many it was otherwiſe, euen a harder matter, and namely with <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, who was not comforted nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed of his ſinnes and burthen of griefe by Chriſt at Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus gates, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he was caſt downe &amp; terrified by him,<note place="margin">Act. 9.8.9. &amp;c.</note> but ſent into the citie to receiue further light and ſatisfaction to his heauie heart from Chriſt by the miniſterie of <hi>Ananias,</hi> a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in the ſame citie; he was his inſtructer, who, if <hi>Paul</hi> had not now by Chriſts gratious goodneſſe, been conuerted, ſhould haue haue bin his priſoner. And this I thought good to ſay, which may be in ſtead of an anſwere to ſuch as obiect in theſe our dayes, that many lie in ſorrow and feare many daies, and ſome, whole yeeres before they beleeue and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue comfort, and ſeldome at the ſame time, when they are wounded and troubled firſt for their ſinnes.</p>
               <p>I ſay,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Why ſome are holden vnder heauines longer then other.</hi>
                  </note> God doth not alwaies keepe one and the ſame time in raiſing vp ſuch as are brought low in themſelues by the ſight of their ſins, but ſometimes doth it ſooner, ſometimes later, euen as the ſeed that is ſowen, commeth not vp alwaies together.

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:16609:23"/>
they themſelues haue been, would become more calme and kind vnto them, and be wounded for their owne great ſinne againſt them.</p>
               <p>But he proceeds further, and deſires to be inſtructed of them, and that in the moſt waightie matters of all. As if he ſhould haue ſaid, Sirs: I ſee now it is true, which I beleeued not, that ye are the ſeruants of the moſt high God, and this ye haue made apparent to me. For I, like a moſt vile beaſt, put you in the dungeon, but I ſee, he regards you, and ſhakes the earth,, and workes wonders for your ſakes. You haue ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued my life, for I was but a dead man. Now ye haue ſhewed ſuch care of my life, ſhew me, I pray you, the way to eternall life. <hi>What ſhall I do,</hi> &amp;c. He thus ſheweth himſelfe willing to heare and learne of them, and he acknowledgeth them able to ſatisfie him therein.</p>
               <p>And indeed then are men in good way to true conuerſion, when they are thus teachable, and when they are perſwaded that ſuch as they repaire vnto, for direction and comfort, are meete to reſolue them. And they who are the elect of God, do conſult and take counſell what to do, of them whom God hath ſent with the word of reconciliation. Theſe are guides ſent of him to bring men into the right way, and to guide them in it.</p>
               <p>O the wonderfull worke of God! would the Iailer thus haue attended to learne of them, if God had not drawne him? would hee that had ſo cruelly vſed them, haue come to bee taught of them? nay, would he not haue vſed them worſe? The Lord therefore meekeneth him, and maketh him a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell fit for grace to be powred into.

Therefore now follow the effects of his faith, which alſo are the fruits of it. Theſe, as they are ſet downe heere, and ſuch as for that time, he had opportunitie to ſhew, by which alſo we may certainly gather that other fruits of faith were in him, theſe (I ſay) may be referred to three, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The firſt was his baptiſme: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the next his reioycing for his owne and his houſholds beleeuing: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the third containe certaine duties of mercie and loue, as his bringing them out of priſon into his houſe, his waſhing their ſtripes, and refreſhing of their hungrie bodies with meate.</p>
               <p>

                     <hi>Good workes follow faith.</hi>
                  </note> that good workes follow faith, as the heate doth the fire. So ſoone as the theefe belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, he confeſſeth Chriſt, &amp; ſheweth other fruits of his faith, ſuch as in that time he could. So this man doth the ſame by his loue to Gods ſeruants. And he doth it immediately, euen the ſame houre of the night: as they were readie to teach; euen ſo was he, to miniſter to their neceſſities. But this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is manifeſt, looke we into the particulars. Of the which I will begin with that which moſt neerely concerneth this matter, and that is the ſealing and confirming of his faith,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The first fruit of his faith: He receiued Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</hi>
                  </note> and the making of it ſure vnto him, that he beleeued indeed, I meane, that he was baptiſed.</p>
               <p>For what would a man in his caſe deſire more, then to haue proofe and teſtimony that he beleeued, when thereby he was partaker of Chriſt, and of eternall life? And Baptiſme was an open badge of Chriſt, and of his righteouſneſſe receiued by faith: euen as Circumciſion was vnto the Fathers in the old Teſtament. <label type="milestone">

                  </label> But what haſte, ye will (perhaps) ſay;<note place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note> could not that be deferred till day at leaſt? for it is ſaid, he was bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in the ſame houre of the night, after they had preached to him and his houſhold, which was a little after midnight.<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                  </label> I anſwere, it is not to be maruelled at, that he deſired ſpeed in that ſo waightie a matter. For they that haue faith, thinke long, till they may haue it ſealed and ratified. And is there not good reaſon thereof?</p>
               <p>If a man had the writing of a great inheritance paſſed ouer to him, would he not thinke it long, till he had the ſeale? And great matters were that night paſſed ouer by the Lord to him: euen heauen, life, ſaluation and happineſſe. Theſe therfore he deſireth to haue Gods ſeale ſet vnto. And ſo as he may haue this, he cares not for his ſleepe, or his eaſe, neither feares he any trouble that might enſue vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it.<note place="margin">

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:16609:28"/>
things that ſhould afterward come to paſſe, putteth in this one amongſt the reſt, ſaying: It ſhall be in the latter dayes; that people ſhall be giuen ouer to ſinne, and euen where the Goſpell ſhall be preached, euen there iniquitie ſhall abound in ſuch wiſe, that it ſhall draw away many of them who haue embraced and loued the truth; ſo that they ſhall faint and fall from the goodneſſe that hath been in them, but let them (ſaith he) rouſe vp themſelues againe, and returne to their firſt loue, and they who yet hold it, let them abide ſtill in it, for they only who continue to the end ſhall be ſaued.</p>
               <p>And by this which he ſaith, it may eaſily be gathered,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Three parts thereof.</hi>
                  </note> that he ſpeaketh of three ſorts, as I alſo entend to do: and withall three things he ſetteth downe.

               <p>Now to begin with the firſt, I wil handle it thus.<note place="margin">

Secondly, applie them in more particular manner to all ſuch as do cauſe iniquitie to abound, that all who deſire, may be able to ſee, whether they be of the number of them, that they may thereafter prouide for themſelues. And thirdly, I will ſhew what vſe all ſuch ought to make of the doctrine which they haue verified in hauing been helpers to encreaſe iniquitie; and that is this; that when they ſee they haue liued in times paſt to no other end, then to helpe to fill the world with ſin, they may giue all diligence to ſeeke the pardon of their euill doings, and neuer reſt quiet vntill they haue obtained it, and come out of them, which is the right vſe of knowing it. But if they ſtill go forward in their euill courſe, they may ſhew themſelues to be, as they are, that is, contemners.</p>
               <p>And that the world ſhall be full of iniquitie in theſe latter daies of ours, it is proued by two reaſons:<note place="margin">

                  </note> the one drawne from Scripture, the other from experience. The Spirit of God ſpeaketh thus in the Scripture,<note place="margin">Matth. 24.37.</note> that <hi>as it was in the dayes of

Noah, ſo ſhall it be in the comming of the Sonne of man.</hi> For as before the floud came, <hi>they did eate and drinke, marrie, and giue in marriage, vntill the day that Noah entred into the Arke, and knew nothing vntill the floud came and tooke them all away, ſo ſhall it then be.</hi> Whereby Chriſt ſheweth that in the latter dayes, a part whereof this age is wherein we liue, the people ſhall be as they were in that wofull time before the world was drowned with waters, which times were fraught with all impietie and iniquitie, with contempt of Gods word and all abomination.</p>

Which commeth to paſſe, when it is not daily and duely conſidered and remembred, priſed and valued aboue all other things, as it is meete it ſhould be, and ſometime alſo was in ſuch account and reckoning with vs, when we firſt beleeued. And then alſo it is aſſwaged and decayeth, when our loue faſteneth ſtrongly vpon tranſitorie delights, profits or preferments, and eſpecially, if it be linked into any of theſe when they ſhall be ſinfull and vnlawfull. Thus I ſay, when God, his word, faithfull Preachers, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of his, with obedience to his will ſhall not be in the greateſt price and eſtimation, but thruſt out by things of leſſe and meaner value, our loue is iuſtly ſaid to become cold, and that reproofe incurred, which our Sauiour heere ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of.</p>

                  </note> is ſaid of our Sauiour heere to be occaſioned, as otherwiſe, ſo eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the multitude of great ſinners, and the beholding of ſuch wicked examples of men, as fill the world with ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and offences. For oh! when men ſhall be alwaies cloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the looſe and profeſſed ill behauiour of ſuch as they liue amongſt, (as righteous <hi>Lot</hi> was with the filthines of the ſtincking Sodomites) it is not eaſily ſeene, what force is in it to dampe and quench goodneſſe in them that behold it; and that; ſometime at the firſt: but when afterwards they ſhall not be able to wind out from their company, and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations of them, but that they ſhall be alwaies croſſing their good courſe, diſgracing their innocent liues, cauilling at their zeale in ſeruing God, and bearing downe all hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, as it were a ſtreame, yea and more then all this, hunting, threatning, and diſquieting them, that cannot approue their bad conuerſation, what ſtraits (thinke we) ſhall they be in?

feruently to all theſe mentioned, as at any time they did: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I excuſe the contrarie.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> As for example, many well minded, when they were firſt brought to the true imbracing of the Goſpell, thought, that all other, who were not as themſelues, and iumpe of their fiſe and meaſure in zeale, were to be iudged and cenſured, as they thought good, namely to haue had nothing in them, neither were to be kept companie with: whereas, both them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues bewray their owne weakenes ſufficiently, all may ſee: and beſide, who doubteth, but that ſuch as are teachable, ſhould be well hoped of, and incouraged to be ſtedfaſt in the good things wherein they had well begun, and ſo to be brought on to the receiuing of faith, and the bearing of Chriſts yoke, as true Chriſtians doe.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Another great weakeneſſe hath poſſeſſed others, and as full of error, that in their zeale, at their firſt beginning they
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:16609:36"/>
haue thought, that they muſt oft breake off their neceſſarie worke to pray and reade, yea and that in the time of doing of their worke, they muſt be praying rather then minding of, and duely regarding the buſines they had in hand. Then the which, what might be thought more ſauoring of ignorance and blindneſſe? whereas they ought to haue knowne, and been perſwaded, that God hath appointed a time to pray, and all other things to giue place thereto, when opportunitie ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth; but yet in time of neceſſarie buſineſſe, that the ſame ſhould be faithfully and diligently attended and followed, and the mind not to be carried after other matters; ſeeing God is ſerued therein euen as he is in reading, praying and the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Alſo many haue fondly and falſely been perſwaded, that whiles they are occupied in holy exerciſes, as prayer, reading, conference, then they haue been more holy then others of their brethren, but if they haue by frailtie failed therein, yea or by other waightie occaſions, or if they haue waxen after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward more dull through want of knowledge or forgetfulnes vnfitter to Gods ſeruice, then they were before; then they haue iudged themſelues the worſt of all Gods people, if they haue not denied that they were any of them at all.</p>
               <p>Many ſuch weakneſſes which yet they count points of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, accompany the moſt of Gods faithful ones of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranter ſort, at their firſt entrance into Chriſt, who ſeeing bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things are found in them, are not imputed to them by the Lord: but yet muſt they not, for all that, be iuſtified in them and borne with, neither thinke, that all things wherein they haue a good meaning, muſt be holden for a vertue. Euen as <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrian,<note place="margin">2.

               <p>Likewiſe <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> and the other good women, whom Chriſt before his death had moſt ſweetly ſeaſoned
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:16609:36"/>
and perfumed with the odours of his heauenly doctrine, ſo that they beleeued in him and followed him,<note place="margin">Marke 16.1.</note> came of a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous mind the third day after his buriall to the ſepulchre to ſee him, ſuppoſing that he had been ſtill dead, and not riſen againe, and brought ſweete ointments with them to annoint his bodie. By the which ceremonie and cuſtome vſed to their dead in thoſe dayes, although they did confirme their faith in the hope of the reſurrection after the manner of their Fathers, who did ſo: yet who doubteth, but that they were led with blind zeale therein toward Chriſt, both in ſeeking him that liued among the dead, and alſo in going about to annoint Chriſts bodie, as if it ſhould haue putrified in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre like other mens? By this that hath been ſaid it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that all things that the faithfull do in a good meaning, are not to be paternes for themſelues or others to follow, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they haue had good warrant for the doing of them; and eſpecially at their firſt conuerſion.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the caueat or watchword before giuen, namely, that all zeale in good people at the firſt ought not to be taken for ſound and ſubſtantiall: I will now proceed. Remember therfore that I ſet downe two reaſons, why Gods ſeruants ſhould take heed in a ſpeciall manner, that they be not made cold in their loue, as Chriſt hath foretold it ſhall be the caſe of many, by meanes of the wickedneſſe which they ſhall ſee in the world. One of theſe reaſons I haue hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; and that is, ſeeing it ſhall be the caſe of many to do ſo.</p>
               <p>The other is this,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The ſecond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe they whoſe loue waxeth cold to God, to the preaching of the Goſpell, and to his people, they fall alſo from the duties which by that loue, they ſhould per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme: or which is all one with it, they do them to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; ſo that God accepteth them not. According to the words of the Apoſtle, <hi>If I giue all my goods to the poore,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.1.2.3</note> 
                  <hi>and my bodie to be burnt, and haue no loue, and though I ſpeake with the tongues of Angels, I am as ſounding braſſe, or a tincking cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball.</hi> So then, if the beſt things which we do be ſin without this loue, it followeth that if that grace of loue be cold and dead in vs, all that we do is abhorred of God.</p>

                  </note>Now to come to the words, ſeeing they only who conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to the end, ſhall bee ſaued, and are bleſſed; the chiefe point heere to be debated, is, who is he that continueth, and how he groweth to it.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Firſt begin well.</hi>
                  </note> The anſwere whereto is at hand, that they who begin well, and daily go forward, ſhall continue to the end; and thereby, and no other way we come to it, that being excepted that I ſaid before; that they muſt not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied mercie who repent at laſt. Of both theſe therefore ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what is requiſite to be ſaid, which briefely ſhall be done. And of the firſt the leſſe, ſeeing in ſhewing before in the firſt point how they who haue cauſed iniquitie to abound, ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; I haue declared, that ſuch repenting is the right way to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:16609:37"/>
make a good end. Therefore this onely I will ſay of a good beginning, that it is requiſite, that all that intend and go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, be ſtedfaſt and ſtabliſhed therein, I meane in faith, in loue, in patience, &amp;c. not flitting and inconſtant.</p>
               <p>This Saint <hi>Peter</hi> requireth, when he ſaith, <hi>Take heed,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.17.</note> 
                  <hi>that ye be not led away from your ſtedfastneſſe in knowledge and grace.</hi> This requireth truth, care and wiſedome, therefore doe the fewer attaine to it, <hi>to be builded and ſetled in their most holie faith,</hi> but the moſt profeſſors are off and on; cheaping,<note place="margin">Iude 20.</note> but not buying: therefore in euery temptation or affliction, for the moſt part, they are doubting, that they haue not repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aright, and that they haue no faith, neither euer had: whereas a foundation well laid, ſtands in ſtormes and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts, and is not throwne downe with wind nor weather.<note place="margin">Matth. 7.27.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And in ſpeaking of this ſo worthie a point, I cannot but bewaile, a common and dangerous practiſe amongſt people, and thoſe of the better ſort, that few by all their hearings and readings are able to collect, and lay together a plaine path<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way to ſaluation, and a direction to a godly life; but by halues, or by ſhreds and pieces: for either they faile in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and ſo they are farre from the right way, ſo that if they would neuer ſo faine enioy the benefit of both, they know not how to go about it, or elſe they ſeeke not with all their hearts to follow that which they know, if their iudgements be ſound; and that maketh all that they pretend or go about, as farre from a good foundation as the former. And ſhould men (thinke we) begin in faith and repentance in ſuch a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? Is ſuch a confuſed and raw entrance into it, like to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit it? This is all that I will ſay of the firſt of the two things that lead to a perſeuering in a godly courſe to our end, and that is a right manner of beginning. For he that hath made a good entrance, is halfe the way to a good end, but he that begins erroniouſly and amiſſe, ſhall the further he goeth, the further go out of the way: let this therefore be well regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and looked to.</p>

<pb n="62" facs="tcp:16609:38"/>
haue ſaid to be required, that is, to build proportionably to it, that as ſome true meaſure of knowledge, faith, hope, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, the feare of God, and other grace is attained, and ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtnes therin; ſo that they be vpholden, maintained and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued daily, as precious things worth the coſt and labor that is beſtowed vpon them: I meane, that they who haue belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and repented, do ſo ſtill; and endeuour aboue all things to hold out therin from day to day. As the Fathers mentioned in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, were ſaid to liue by faith; that is,<note place="margin">Hebr. 11.</note> ſet it a worke, after they beleeued: and they that repented at <hi>Iohns</hi> baptiſme,<note place="margin">Matth. 3.8.</note> were exhorted by him, to <hi>bring forth the fruits of amendment</hi> afterward, that ſo they might well teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, that they went on in repentance ſtill.</p>
               <p>And therefore muſt <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 26.41.</note> watching, <note n="b" place="margin">Luke 18.1.</note> praying, <note n="c" place="margin">1. Pet. 2.2.</note> hearing, and ſuch other good meanes be vſed daily, with as good appetite as at the firſt beginning, that we may grow thereby. The which courſe being obſerued, we cannot faile, but be found of the Lord in peace, whenſoeuer he ſhall come for our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerance out of this vaile of miſerie,<note place="margin">Matth.</note> 
                  <hi>and happie ſhal that ſeruant be, whom his master, when he commeth, ſhall find ſo occupied: he ſhall bid him enter into his masters ioy.</hi> But ſeeing this aduice and direction is not ſo ſoone receiued and vſed, as giuen; therefore there are many ſtartings aſide, and goings out of the way, and ſo they leaue their firſt loue, as I haue ſaid of the ſecond ſort, to their ſmall comfort.</p>
               <p>And amongſt many troubles and griefes which they bring vpon themſelues thereby, they complaine, that they cannot haue the ioy that they firſt had at their beginning: and what maruell? ſeeing they haue waxed wearie of that eſteeming and priſing of faith and godly life, which at firſt was in them. Whereas they who with the good Philippians,<note place="margin">Philip. 1.5.</note> 
                  <hi>hold on their fellowſhip in the Goſpel from the firſt day</hi> afterwards, are alwaies readie to welcome death the Lords meſſenger. For they thus growing on and abiding; doe continue and ſhall be found faithfull and conſtant at their end, whether by naturall or by violent death they be taken away, all is one, and they perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering ſo ſhall be ſaued, as Chriſt ſaith heere, and receiued into heauenly habitations for euer.</p>

                  </note>This text deuideth it ſelfe moſt fitly into three parts. The firſt is a mixed ſpeech which the Lord vttereth to <hi>Moſes,</hi> commending ſomewhat, and diſliking ſomewhat of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples anſwere, in theſe words: <hi>This people hath ſaid well,</hi> but their heart is not ſutable vnto their words. The ſecond thing is, what the Lord wiſheth to them: and that is, <hi>ſuch an heart</hi> as might ſute with their words, from which onely, and from no other heart, this feare of God and obedience to his will, which he liked of, could come. In theſe words; <hi>Oh that there were ſuch an heart in them to feare mee, and to keepe all my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundements alwaies.</hi> The third is the fruite of ſuch an heart and life, and that is proſperitie and welfare to them and to their children for euer.</p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The first part. The Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth the peoples words, but condemneth their heart.</hi>
                  </note>Now to begin with the firſt, this mixed ſpeech of the Lord (which I ſo call, becauſe it commendeth ſomewhat in the peoples anſwere, and diſliketh ſomewhat in them: it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth their words, but condemneth their heart) this mixed ſpeech of the Lord (I ſay) teacheth vs clearely, that men may
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:16609:39"/>
poſſibly vtter good words, and yet themſelues bee without grace, their words may be good but their hearts naught:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Doct.</hi>
                  </note> ſo that while they commend religion, the preaching of the Goſpell, and the profeſſion thereof; yet for all that, they may be vnprofitable in their liues, and not ſound and vpright in their hearts, without which their ſpeech helpeth them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And if it be ſaid, it is not ſufficient for the proofe of this doctrine, that is here ſaid in the text, for poſſiblie it may be gathered amiſſe, let it be prooued by two or three witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that there may be no exception brought againſt it. As that for example in the 50. Pſalme, verſe 16. where yee may finde this: <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the wicked ſaid God, what hast thou to doe,</hi>

                  <hi>to take my word in thy mouth, and hatest to be reformed?</hi> What needeth there any explanation of theſe words? The Lord vehemently reprooueth them for ſpeaking of his word, as though they bare great affection to it, when in the meane while they would not be ſubiect to it, nor be directed by it. To the which, that may be added, which our Sauiour ſaith: <hi>This people draw neere to me with their lips,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 15.29.</note> 
                  <hi>but their hearts are farre from me, in vaine doe ſuch worſhip me.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> agreeth moſt fitly with them both, when he ſaith,<note place="margin">Ezech. 33.30.</note> 
                  <hi>Sonne of man, this people talke of thee by the walles, and doores of their houſes, and ſay one to another, come (I pray you) and heare what the word is that commeth from the Lord; and they heare thy words, but they will not doe them.</hi> By all which, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that to haue good words in our mouthes, without the vprightneſſe of the heart, doth not commend vs to God.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Good ſpeech commendable, yea comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>And yet let not this be thought of any one to be ſpoken by me, as though I made light of good ſpeech, or thought it little worth, which I acknowledge to be an excellent gift of God, (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake of it in the people of Corinth) and I doe bewaile that the want of it is ſo great, in ſo long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Goſpell preached, yea I ſay more, that wee are commaunded of God, <hi>to take vnto vs words,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hoſ. 14.2.</note> to expreſſe our requeſts, confeſſion of ſinnes, thankeſgiuing, and our coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of amendment of life, and to be <hi>examples to others in our communication,</hi> as well as in our conuerſation,<note place="margin">1.

were ſufficient, it is nothing; and to ſtay our hope vpon it, as if we thought it a teſtimonie of our happineſſe, it is no better then a bruiſed reede. This therefore, or any other ſuch gifts of God are ſeemely ornaments, in them that haue them, for in moſt parts of the land, ye ſhall not finde good words and godly ſpeech common: I need not ſay in Wales, or Ireland, but not in many places of England, but diſpiſed rather, and laughed to ſcorne; and rotten and filthie communication intertained with great applauſe in ſtead of it, but yet, (as I haue ſaid) this alone of it ſelfe without other gifts of God, is not currant,<note place="margin">

Whereas wee ought to ſearch diligently and trie our waies, and the whole courſe of our hearts and liues, and pull downe the olde ruines of both, and ſet vp the contrarie in ſtead thereof in both, and all little enough to make a due proofe vnto vs, that we are partakers of the promiſe of eternall life: which to be neceſſarie to aſſure vs of the ſame, and no leſſe; that ſaying of the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> doth liuely ſhew: where he bringeth in the wicked ſpeaking thus, when they ſought how to be acceptable to God, that they might pleaſe him.</p>

Will the Lord be pleaſed with thouſands of Rammes, or with ten thouſand riuers of oyle? Shall I giue my first borne for my tranſgreſſion? Euen the fruite of my bodie, for the ſinne of my ſoule?</hi> But the Prophet anſwered farre otherwiſe then they looked for: ſaying, <hi>He hath ſhewed to thee (O man) what is good, and what the Lord requireth of thee: ſurely to doe iustice, and to loue mercie, and to humble thy ſelfe, and to walke with God.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:16609:40"/>Whereby he ſheweth, that man cannot direct himſelfe in the great matters of pleaſing God, and ſeeking his fauour, but God muſt guide him therein, to the end hee may haue peace, and conſequently that good words are not ſufficient to reſt in, for welfare and happines, without better furniture of grace and goodnes. And to goe a ſteppe further, if good ſpeech, (as commendation of the word, praiſing of God, and communication of his works and will) be not to be reſted in, in what caſe are they, who haue almoſt no good ſpeech, but rather that which commeth from them is profane, foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, corrupt, and ſuch as ouerthwarteth and croſſeth good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe?</p>
               <p>But here a queſtion ariſeth about the people mentioned in the text, for if their anſwere were good,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>There is a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſin betwixt hypocriſie and ſinceritie.</hi>
                  </note> why was it not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed? meant they not as they ſpake? I ſay, yes, but that freed them onely from hypocriſie, but was no argument of their ſinceritie for there is a middle ſinne betwixt them both, and may be called halting or not vpright, and may cleerely be diſcerned by that which is ſpoken of the Iſraelites in the Pſalme. Who made a couenant there with God,<note place="margin">Pſalm. 78.35.</note> and had not to doe with men; and therefore though they brake and went from it, they could not be charged with hypocriſie, but yet they dealt treacherouſly with the Lord, in that they were not carefull to keepe and performe it. The words are theſe in effect: <hi>When he ſlew them, they ſought him, yea they returned, and ſought God early: but they flattered him with their mouth, and diſſembled with him in their tongue, for their heart was not vpright with him, neither were they faithfull in his couenant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now from this that hath been ſaid in the anſwere to the queſtion, a good poynt is to bee obſerued, namely,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Great heed to be taken to our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenants with God.</hi>
                  </note> that wee take great heed when we couenant with God, about amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment either in generall, or to forſake any particular ſinne in our life, (though we doe it in ſecret, no man knowing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) I ſay great heed is to be taken, that we doe not afterwards waxe remiſſe, and cold in going about to performe the ſame; for then God will count it but flattering and deceiuing of him, which he will not put vp at our hands, for why? men will not beare ſuch indignitie one at anothers hands. I ſpeake
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:16609:41"/>
this, ſeeing many neuer ſuſpect any danger to be comming toward them by breach of couenant to God, if they cannot be challenged for hypocriſie before men. Which indeed, is the groſſer of the two, and it is the ſinne of the moſt, to vtter great words before men of their godlineſſe, when yet they deny the power thereof, but yet the other is alſo odious to God, when men ſo ſlightly regard the promiſe which they haue in their good moode made to him of obedience, as though it were not to be looked after.</p>
               <p>Such are al they, who hauing in their trouble, ſicke bed, or at their receiuing of the Sacrament, profeſſed ſeriouſlie to turne to the Lord,<note place="margin">Pſal. 78.57.</note> haue yet <hi>ſtarted aſide afterwards like a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken bow.</hi> I haue my ſelfe ſometime had good hope of people, when I viſiting them in their likeliehood of death, haue heard their franke and free promiſe made to God, of forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their former ill life. But when I haue ſeene ſo ſlight fruite to follow in many of them, they returning after their recouerie,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 2.22.</note> to their wicked courſe, <hi>as the dogge to his vomit,</hi> tempting God thereby in a fearefull manner, (which is <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raos</hi> ſinne) my good hope hath been much cooled, and this I haue learned to bee ſo true, by long experience, that I dare not reſt vpon ſuch couenants. And yet God forbid, but that many couenanting the ſame by like occaſions; ſhould looke conſcionably to performe their couenant afterward, though too many fall from them, according to that which is ſaid by <hi>Dauid</hi> in the Pſalme:<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.106.</note> 
                  <hi>I haue ſworne and will performe it, that I will keepe thy righteous iudgements.</hi>

                  </note>Thus much of the mixed ſpeech of God in the firſt part of the text. Now it followeth what the Lord wiſhed to the people in the ſecond part.

To the which may be anſwered, that the feare of God

Euen ſuch an heart is fit to breed the feare of God, and in ſuch an heart it can dwell, and in no other. And that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by our Sauiour <hi>a good heart,</hi> which onely,<note place="margin">Luk. 6.46.</note> and no other can bring forth good things. For ſo he ſaith, a good man out of the good treaſure of his heart, bringeth forth good things, and contrariwiſe: ſo that if the heart be good, that is, truely turned to God, then it is fitted for that which God here wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed to his people, that is, <hi>to feare him, and keepe his comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements,</hi> and not elſe.</p>
               <p>Now for proofe that it muſt be thus,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>First, that it be troubled for ſin.</hi>
                  </note> the ſcripture is cleare and plentifull. As firſt that the heart muſt bee wounded for ſinne, and broken with ſorrow and feare, till it bee ſicke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, is prooued by the words of our Sauiour, where hee ſaith: <hi>The whole haue no neede of the Phyſitian but the ſicke.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 5.31. Act. 2.37.</note> And they in the Acts were pricked in conſcience for their wofull eſtate, before they came to <hi>Peter</hi> to aske how they might bee healed: but then they came to him and the other Apoſtles, though they had railed on them before, and ſaid, <hi>Men and brethren what ſhall we doe?</hi> As if they ſhould haue ſaid; in this our diſtreſſe and diſpayring in our ſelues what helpe can ye miniſter vnto vs, or eaſe vnto our ſoules? This contrition and ſorrow is one of the three things which helpe to make the euill heart good. And yet this without the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two, is nothing to this purpoſe, but fit onely to raiſe vp flaſhes and feares of hell to the tormenting of the conſcience, and the holding of it in ſlauerie and bondage, for which cauſe, it is called of the Apoſtle, <hi>the ſpirit of bondage.</hi>

                  </note>To proceede therefore, the ſecond thing required to make the heart good, is faith vnfained: that the afflicted minde may ſee and beleeue the ſinnes of it to bee pardoned, to the eaſing and quieting of it, which then ſtandeth in need of it, and moſt earneſtly deſireth it, and the Lord hath giuen a free grant of it vnto ſuch as are thus prepared for it, by earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring it;<note place="margin">Luk. 5 31.</note> euen as in the forementioned place, the Lord ſaith, I am a phyſitian for the ſicke,<note place="margin">Iohn 7.37.</note> and in another place, <hi>I will giue the water of life vnto ſuch as thirst,</hi> which the ſicke and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled conſcience hearing, counteth it the happieſt and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comeſt tidings that could be brought vnto it, and ſo by due and aduiſed conſidering it, laieth holde of it, though weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and by little and little, the Lord inabling the partie; and ſo beleeueth, that it is as effectuallie offered to him, as to any of Gods children, that haue already imbraced it.

What ſhall I offer vnto the Lord for this his great goodneſſe? And ſo, hee being conſtrained by the loue of God ſo ſhed into his heart, is perſwaded and inabled in good ſort to goe about the dutie which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, indeuoring and purpoſing to walke before him in vprightnes and innocencie for euer after. And this deſire of his, not being frothie and raſh, ſtirred vp of more and paine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full feare, as in many wicked ones it is, but proceeding from faith (which worketh by loue) and from the certaintie of the fauour of God aſſured to him by the holy Ghoſt; is not a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine paſſion in him (which is hot and feruent for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent onely) but comming from ſo good a foundation and ground; ſanctifieth him effectually, by working a diſlike of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:16609:42"/>
euill, becauſe it is euil, and an heartie and vnfained loue of al goodneſſe; which grace being thus wrought in him, is the third thing required to the changing of the heart, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it vnto God. And this muſt go with faith, as we are taught in the Epiſtle to the Corinthians, where he ſaith,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 7.1.</note> 
                  <hi>See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we haue theſe promiſes, let vs clenſe our ſelues from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the fleſh and ſpirit, and grow vp to full holines in the feare of God.</hi> With this agreeth that of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1. Iohn 3.3.</note> that if we haue the hope, which is the daughter of faith, we <hi>purge our ſelues</hi> from ſinne as it commeth to our ſight.</p>
               <p>Thus I haue ſhewed what graces of God muſt neceſſarily be planted in the heart, that it may bring foorth this fruit, I mean the feare of God, &amp; that ſo it may become ſuch an hart, as God heere wiſheth the people, when he ſaith, oh that there were ſuch an heart in them. Now that the Chriſtian Reader may not be deceiued in iudging whether he hath ſuch an heart or not, I will adde ſome caueats about theſe three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties which make the heart good, that he examining and obſeruing them, may ſee whether he haue them or no.</p>
               <p>And to begin, let him know, that about the firſt of them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Two caueats a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout wound of conſcience.</hi>
                  </note> which is pricke or wound of conſcience and feare of Gods diſpleaſure for the ſame, I giue theſe two caueats or watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>words. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The one is this, that if God preſſe our conſciences with the powerfull preaching of his word,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
                  </label> and accuſe and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt them thereby, that we in no wiſe reſiſt that worke of grace, but ſubmit our ſelues thereto, ſeeing he vſeth to do ſo to them, whom he will ſaue. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The other, that being arreſted thus by him, in any wiſe we deſpaire not. In both which we might be like eaſily to offend, if we ſhould not take this war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and watchword.</p>
               <p>Both are very neceſſarie: for as we are readie to run to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities in all other things, rather then to keepe a meane, and that which is commendable betwixt both: ſo do we eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encline thereto in theſe. For either men are ſlie and ſubtill to ſhun all ſorrow and checke of conſcience for ſinne; or if they can no longer, they are readie to deſpaire. In the firſt, they may fitly be compared to them, who are taken with ſickneſſe, and yet will beare it out too long, as though they

Both are alike neceſſarie: the firſt for the bold, and ſuch as feele their ſin to be no great burthen to their conſcience, and yet of al other are moſt ready to affirme, that they beleeue in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, which he himſelfe flatly denieth, ſaying, <hi>I came not to call the righteous</hi> (that is, ſuch as feele as little burthen of their ſin as if they were righteous) <hi>but ſinners</hi> (who feele the burthe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their ſin, as a debter doth his debt) <hi>vnto repentance.</hi> The ſecond caueat is as neceſſary for the afflicted conſcience, who though he haue right to the promiſe by Chriſts free grant, yet through weakneſſe and want of experience, is hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from beleeuing and claſping about it, and all becauſe he doth not duly conſider his libertie, and the warrant that he hath from Chriſt for his ſo doing.

not, but that Gods prouidence ruleth, yet the partie offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, for that he doth not embrace that which is freely giuen him by God, and by meanes thereof, he cannot praiſe and be thankfull to God for it.</p>
               <p>About the third point that is neceſſarily required to make the heart good, which is ſanctification,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Two watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>words about ſanctification.</hi>
                  </note> theſe two watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>words are to be receiued. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The one, that he of whom we ſpeak do loue goodneſſe, and loath euill; not ſome one or few, leſt he deceiue himſelfe about it, but all; nor in priuate reſpects, but becauſe it is euill and hated of God. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The other, that theſe two, namely, to loath and loue, be conſtantly ſetled in him for continuance.</p>
               <p>The reaſon of both is manifeſt, as of the former: for if one ſin ſhould be loathed, and another loued, ſome diſliked and ſhamed, and other delighted in, and embraced; what could be more ridiculous, and further off from the nature of true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance?

                  </label> could not be ſatisfied nor anſwered by many good actions. A thing worthie to be noted; ſeeing many take libertie againſt their conſcience, to doe what they deſire to doe, and yet will be counted repentant perſons, as well as the beſt, and this be ſaid of the firſt of theſe two caueats. For the ſecond, if a man ſhould be very forward in abhorring ſinne at the firſt, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward ſhould grow ſlouthfull and careleſſe, and make no conſcience of wicked deſires, and breake out into looſeneſſe of heart; this were enough to blemiſh his ſanctification, how ſound ſoeuer it might haue ſeemed, if not to bewray it to haue beene meere hypocriſie: which of the two would bee thought moſt likely.</p>
               <p>Thus I haue ſaid that which I thought meete of this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to helpe him that deſireth it, to attaine ſuch an heart as bringeth forth the feare of God; euen that which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth.

                  </note> &amp;c. Heere ye may ſee to what end ſuch an heart is wiſhed, euen to breed Gods feare. For God plainely teacheth, that there cannot be in any, the feare of God without it. This let vs a little conſider of, particularly. We know all, with what ſcorne and deteſtation, this ſpeech would be reiected of thoſe that ſcarcely profeſſe the Goſpell, if the graueſt Diuine in the greateſt aduiſednes ſhould vtter it, that the feare of God is not in them.

For from whence ſhould it come? Is it a ſudden paſſion of the heart that riſeth and falleth? or that with the tide, it ebbeth and floweth? Is it not rather a ſanctified affection which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, euen as the heart is ſanctified, in which it groweth?

               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:16609:45"/>And that none may maruell, that I ſpeake thus, let all fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know, that this feare of God, is ſuch a gift of God, as by the which a man is preſerued and kept from euill, neither da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth he that hath that, come neere it, therefore when the Lord ſpake of <hi>Iob,</hi> and commended him for fearing God, he added this, that he eſchewed euill alſo. This will more liuely appeare by a ſimilitude or two, drawne from commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for this purpoſe, note what force there is in naturall feare. The blind and ſuperſtitious people in the time of Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, were made ſo affraid of ſpirits walking, that they durſt not go thorow a churchyard in the fearful time of the night: and he that carrieth a great ſumme of money dareth not paſſe alone by woods and mountaines: ſo he that is well ſeaſoned with the feare of God, dareth not drink vp the draffe, &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſinnes of the times in the which he liueth, but aboue all things doth carefully auoid them. And he that ſhall liue among the common ſort of bad people, and will not be like vnto them, nor dares not taſte of their dainties, had need to be well armed, and to haue his hart well fenced againſt them.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing the feare of God is ſuch a grace, and hath ſuch force in whomſoeuer it dwelleth, I may by this as a ſecond argument conclude,<note place="margin">

                  </note> that the common profeſſors of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell and ſuch as draw neere to God with their bodies, hauing their hearts farre from him, haue not his feare in them, ſeeing not only they make no queſtion in matters they doubt of to be euill, for they ruſh and breake thorow them boldly; but alſo in things which are apparantly wicked, they do the ſame and neither blancke nor bluſh at it, when they haue done, whereas the feare of God bringeth foorth moſt contrary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, as hath been ſhewed.</p>

                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Secondly, that they might keep his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                  </note>Now let vs heare of another fruit which commeth from ſuch an heart, and from the feare of God alſo ioyntly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and this is a good and godly life, and a keeping of Gods Commandements. For ſo the Lord ſaith; <hi>Oh that there were ſuch an heart in them, that they did feare me, and keepe all my Commandements alwaies:</hi> which to do, what is it elſe, but to lead a godly and Chriſtian life? For as the feare of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth from ſuch an heart, as I haue ſpoken of; ſo a godly
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:16609:45"/>
life commeth from both. For they breed not dumpiſhneſſe, deadneſſe and melancholy, as the wicked world imagineth, but an holy care and deſire to pleaſe God in all things, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther take they away delight from a man in doing the duties of this life, but enable and ſtrengthen him rather to do them in good ſort.</p>
               <p>Such a life goeth with the fear of God. And though I mean as the Lord alſo doth, by keeping his Commandements, no perfection, but an endeuour to keepe them,<note place="margin">1. Chron. 28.7.</note> nor any other life then is accompanied with infirmities, &amp; ſuch an one as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a conſtant watch, may breake forth ſometimes into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces; yet I mean ſuch a life as endeuoureth to keep all the commandements of God (in omitting euill and doing good) as wel as any one of them, and in the ſame to perfeuere and abide as well as to begin. Which grace we muſt know, is granted by God to be enioyed of ſuch as delight in it, &amp; haue it in great price, euen in this life, whereby they may ſhine as lights vnto others which is a rich portion in ſo wicked a world as this is, and yet few haſten to bee acquainted with it.</p>
               <p>But how ſafe and ſweet a life it is, and how free from many great calamities wherewith the contrary life is filled, another place fitter for it, ſhall declare and teſtifie. Only let this be granted, which cannot be denied, the words of the text ſo cleerely prouing it, without any ſtraining of them,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>This must be in particular and constantly.</hi>
                  </note> that it is no godly life, in which there is not conſcience made of the particular actions of it, neither is the feare of God there, where there is not a faithfull endeuour and labouring to keepe all his Commandements conſtantly, for ſo it is in the text, (all my Commandements, and alwaies). But this point I paſſe ouer more briefely, and preſſe it not at large, ſeeing in other places I handle it more fully. And thus much of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of the text, namely, what God wiſheth vnto the people, and alſo of the ſecond effect of a good heart, namely, a good life.</p>
               <p>Now followeth the third part of the text:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The third part: The fruit of ſuch an heart and life.</hi>
                  </note> in which hee ſetteth downe the fruit of ſuch an heart and life; and that is

twofold:<note place="margin">

                  </note> one redounding to the parties, in whom they are, the other to their poſteritie and children.

For ſo hee ſaith, <hi>That it might goe well with them, and their children for euer.</hi> So that the Lord would haue vs know, that all, in whom there is <hi>ſuch an heart, that they doe feare God, and indeuour to keepe his commaundements alwaies,</hi> ſhall proſper and be well liking in that courſe. For by ſaying, it ſhall goe well with them, his meaning is, they ſhall ſee Gods bleſſing ſo to accompanie them in that courſe of life, as they ſhall confeſſe it to be to their exceeding good liking, and ſo, as in no other they could finde the like by many degrees.</p>
               <p>And yet this is not to bee vnderſtoode of outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperitie, peace, and welfare, in riches, honour, and ſuch like, ſimplie, but conditionally ſo farre as they be good for Gods children. Whereof the godly for the moſt part are voide, and this hungrie ſcrambling world will keepe them farre e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough off from them: and yet this is no cauſe of griefe to them neither, God prouiding better for them, that they ſhould be leſſe wedded to this world. But God principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie meaneth hereby that hee will make their life pleaſing and comfortable to them with inward peace and gladneſſe of heart, which farre ſurmount the other, and yet as hee ſeeth it expedient, they ſhall haue ſufficiencie of the other alſo.</p>
               <p>All men much deſire peace euen with men; they finde ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice and contention with the vnquietnes that goeth with it, to be tedious, troubleſome and vnwelcome to them, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen outward peace to be imbraced.

For it is a ſingular gift of God to liue without feare by men, one man being, vſually as the prouerbe ſaith, a wolfe, nay a diuell to another.

Who counted it fooliſhneſſe; and contrariwiſe, the greateſt happineſſe to <hi>inioy the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon?</hi> As <hi>Ieza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> the miſtreſſe of perſecutors, and <hi>Corah</hi> with his company, the rebell againſt Gods faithfull Miniſters, and <hi>Haman</hi> the proude, a deadly enemie to all that worſhipped God truely? Did not theſe with their companions, finde that they met with their match? And did they not leaue ſufficient teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie behinde them, that their glorie was their ſhame, and their happineſſe had been to haue loued that which they loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed, and purſued in the ſeruants of God, I meane true godlineſſe?</p>
               <p>Euen ſo the liues of thoſe, whom they perſecuted is bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, euen as their memorie alſo is, and ſo ſhall all they be, that follow their ſteps, accordingly as the Lord ſaith here, <hi>It ſhall goe well with them that feare me and keepe my commandements:</hi> And ſo I conclude this poynt, maruailing at them, who thinke it more then needeth; to bee more forward this way then others,<note place="margin">1.

And therfore, our Sauiour being demanded in Luke by the Phariſes, when the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God ſhould come, he anſwereth:<note place="margin">Luk. 17.20.</note> 
                  <hi>the kingdome of God commeth not with outward obſeruation, neither ſhall men ſpeake of it loe it is here, or loe it is there, for behold the kingdome of God is within you.</hi> It is a kingdome ouer the inward hart and conſcience; there he hath ſet his throne, and there he wil reigne euen in vs; and therefore the lawes of our king doe not bind the outward act onely, but his lawes binde the very conſcience.

               </p>
               <p>Now this Goſpell which is the powerfull inſtrument of God for the erecting of this his kingdome in vs, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called by the name of the kingdom of God in this place, is here commended vnto vs by a parable. The effect whereof, as I ſaid, is this, that how great a reckoning ſoeuer men make of other things, and how ſmal and ſlight account ſoeuer they make of the Goſpel of Ieſus Chriſt,<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Note. </seg>
                  </label> yet whoſoeuer he be, that commeth to know the incomparable value, and excellency of it, he will thinke no paines too greate, nor coſt, to much, that he may obtaine it: nor any care too greate to keepe it when he hath it: but rather he wil part withal he hath, Houſe, Land, Goods, pleaſure, friends, and whatſoeuer els, then hee will forgoe ſoe pretious and ſo inualuable a iewel, as he ſeeth the Goſpell to be.</p>
               <p>But for our more cleare vnderſtanding of this Parable, we are to know, that the Goſpell or kingdome of heauen, is here compared not to the perſon, as the words may perhaps ſeeme at the firſt, to carry it, when it is ſaid: <hi>the kingdome of heauen is like to a marchant man, ſeeking good pearles:</hi> but to the pearle the rich and pretious pearle, which the Marchant findeth.</p>
               <p>So that the meaning of the words is all one, as if they had bin layed downe in this forme and manner; The kingdome of God is like vnto a moſt pretious pearle,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The fruitfull hearer of the Goſpell is like vnto a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant man in three reſpects.</hi>
                  </note> which a marchant hauing found, that ſought for good pearles, ſold all that he had to buy it.</p>
               <p>According to this expoſition, I will handle the parable. We are therefore to vnderſtand, that the fruitfull and kind hearer of the Goſpell, is reſembled heere to a merchant man: and that in three properties, though they be not all commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable:
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:16609:50"/>
neither therefore is the hearer a profitable hearer, till he be commendable.</p>
               <p>So that the beſt hearer in his beginning and firſt eſtate that he is in to God-ward, thereby is likened to a merchant man, and to ſuch an one, as by the kind of his trafficke and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize, whereabout he is occupied, ſeeketh pearles.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For as he doth, ſo euery hearer at firſt, ſeeketh pleaſure and profit, &amp;c. that is his pearle. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, he is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, in reſpect of the euent that commeth after his ſeeking, that as he ſeeking common pearles, lighteth ſometime on a pearle of great price, ſo many a hearer, while he is buſie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout commodities and pleaſures, beginneth to ſee in the Goſpel preached, a pearle of greater price, then he had found before, that is, aſſurance of ſaluation.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, and laſtly, this hearer is compared to the merchant in another reſpect, namely, of the effect that followeth. For when he hath found that pearle of great price, he ſelleth all that he hath and buyeth it. So the hearer that hath found this pearle of ſaluation in the Goſpel, that he neuer found before, and knoweth the value of it, he ſetteth light by all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon pearles and former delights, and ſelles them all away, to the end he may enioy this.</p>
               <p>To proſecute theſe three therefore in order, that yee may haue the right vſe of this parable, vnderſtand that the hearer is compared (to ſet it downe briefely) to the merchant in three things, to wit, in ſeeking, finding, and buying.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>All men ſeeke after pearles; ſuch as in their opinion may make them hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie.</hi>
                  </note> In ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king good pearles; in finding one of great price: in buying that, and ſelling all for it. Of theſe in order more largely. The firſt propertie therefore of the merchant, fitly reſembleth the eſtate and condition of all men that are hearers: for all ſeeke pearles, that is, they ſeeke for that, which may in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, make them happie and bleſſed men, and looke what they haue imagined in their own conceit, to be like to bring them to be happie, that they labour, and by all meanes ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to obtaine. In that (I ſay) the hearer is like to a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant man, that careth not to trauell by wet and drie, by ſea and land; ſo that he may ſtore himſelfe with rich and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pearles. For there is no man, but if he look into his owne
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:16609:51"/>
heart, and diligently examine himſelfe, he ſhall find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which aboue all other things for the time, he doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; and whereunto the ſway of his deſires carrie him, and that thing is the pearle of that man, and he vſeth al the means he can to compaſſe and attaine it.</p>
               <p>Thus one man ſtudieth and bendeth all his paines and care, only for this, how he may liue at eaſe and in pleaſure, and voluptuouſnes. Another, he ſeeketh after gaine and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and to adde houſe to houſe, and land to land. A third, he followeth his ambitious humour in ſeeking after fauour and authoritie, and renowne in the world. But theſe are all but deceitful pearles. They make a gliſtering ſhew to a mans co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit a farre off,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>But are neuer ſatisfied.</hi>
                  </note> but when he hath them, and conſidereth them aright, and as they are; then the vanitie and the baſeneſſe of them appeares, and therefore they that follow theſe, with tooth and naile, as they ſay, they are alwaies reſtleſſe, while they think of the vncertainty and momentany ſtate of them; and neuer ſatisfied with any thing they haue attained. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the voluptuous man with his pleaſure, nor the couetous man with his wealth, nor the ambitious with his honor, nor any man with that he hath neuer ſo greatly deſired.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The voluptuous man.</hi>
                  </note>For euen the very pleaſures, and ioyes, and delights of the voluptuous man, are as a continual feauer or ague, to vex and diſquiet his mind, howſoeuer he make a faire ſhew, and ſeem to be merry &amp; happy; yet he euer carries a ſting in his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that inwardly prickes, and torments him in ſuch ſort, as in his greateſt mirth and iollitie he neuer can heartily and ſou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly reioyce. And though the pleaſures be as hony for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time in his mouth; yet he ſhal find the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they are ſunck into his ſtomacke, to be as bitter and as vnpleaſant as gall. The like may be ſaid of the couetous and ambitious perſon.</p>

               <p>But not to ſtand particularly in exemplifying this point, I will bring one, who had his part in them al, pleaſures, profits, and honor: let him tell vs the worth of them.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Example of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Salomon</hi> was ſuch an one; he made triall of all wayes, and ſpared no paine, labour nor coſt, to trie what fruit and commoditie was to be reaped of them all. He had honor and fame, the greateſt that euer any Prince had, that liued on the earth. For pleaſure he inioyed whatſoeuer his wiſdome could deuiſe, and his hart deſire. He had his Orchards and Gardens, planted and ſet with all the moſt choice and excellent trees and herbes,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:16609:52"/>
whereof he had not only the ſight to feed and pleaſe his eye; the ſent to feed his ſmell; and the fruit to pleaſe his taſte; but the exact knowledge of euery tree and ſimple therein, which he alſo committed after to writing; and imparted to others.</p>
               <p>If muſick might delight, he had beſides the ſolemne quier of ſinging men, ſuch a quier as no Prince in the world had vnto this day; ſinging men, ſinging women, which he had priuately for his owne delight: he had his poſſeſſion of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, of Beeues, of ſheep, of houſes, of vineyards, of ſiluer, of gold, of all precious ſtones, and all the choice treaſures of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther kingdomes and prouinces, aboue any King that euer raigned in Ieruſalem, or that we can reade of in any hiſtories. And all theſe did he enioy, with great peace and proſperitie, both at home and abroad.</p>
               <p>So that if any man could euer be happie by following his pleaſures, <hi>Salomon</hi> was the man. He had a greater wiſedome, then euer had any to inuent, and contriue and deuiſe, and he had all meanes at will, to compaſſe and effect them all. If any man could be happie by his wealth, <hi>Salomon</hi> was the man, for he had ſiluer as the ſtones of the ſtreet, and gold for all his veſſels, and the adorning of all his buildings, and ſtore of rich and precious ſtones. If honor might make a man happie, he had more then euer any Prince in regard of the incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble glorie and wiſdome, which God gaue vnto him.</p>
               <p>All theſe <hi>Salomon</hi> enioyed, as much to his deſire as euer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hath done or ſhall do. And what was the happines that he found in them?<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 1.14·</note> Surely, <hi>vanitie, and vexation of ſpirit.</hi> And what then ſhould we account of theſe?

He tried all theſe, and he tried them throughly, and as they ſay, vnto the proofe; and found them in experience ſuch, as in his Eccleſiaſtes he hath laid them downe to be, and as euery one that will be ſo fooliſh as to make triall, ſhall find them to bee by his owne experience.

Let this be inſtead of many examples vnto vs.</p>
               <p>So that all men, we ſee, ſeeke for pearles, and for good pearles, but the moſt are deceiued with falſe and counterfeit pearles, when they come to the triall, they find them as baſe, and of as ſmall value and reckoning, to reſt in, as the dirt which is vnder their feet; ſo vaine and vile are all the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and riches, and honors, and worldly things (to make a man happie) which men ſo highly price in their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit. And this vilenes and baſenes, is much more in all other pearles, that is, in all worldly things, which men heere hunt and ſeeke after.</p>
               <p>The vſe of this doctrine is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vſe.</hi>
                  </note> that no man pleaſe himſelfe in the moſt precious things in this world, but ſeeke for thoſe which may make him happie. And that theſe pearles are all ſo meane and little worth. Our Sauiour Chriſt very euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly noteth vnto vs, in the words following, when he ſaith, the merchant found one pearle of great price.</p>
               <p>By the which is meant the Goſpell, giuing vs thereby to vnderſtand, that it is a pearle of great price and value, he aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the other pearles, and noteth them to be of no price, nor value to reſt vpon. But of this afterward in the next point: In the meane while we ſee (and with that I will conclude this firſt point) that in this firſt act of the merchant, all men that are hearers in the viſible Church, agree with him: namely, that they ſeeke for pearles, that is, one way or other to be happie in this world. I haue ſhewed alſo, what vſe we ought to make thereof. Now it followeth that I come to the ſecond act or propertie of the merchant, and that is,<note place="margin">
                     <p>
                        <hi>The ſecond pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie wherein the hearer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembleth the merchant man. Two things here to be conſidered. First, the thing that be is ſaid to find.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Gospell in diuers respects compared di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſly.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </note> that he finds one pearle of great price.</p>
               <p>In this propertie two things are to be conſidered. Firſt, the thing that he is ſaid to find: ſecondly, what it meaneth and importeth, that he is ſaid to find it. Firſt, the thing that he is ſaid to find, is <hi>one pearle of great price.</hi> By which pearle he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth nothing elſe (as I haue ſhewed) but the Goſpell, that is to ſay, the glad tidings of ſaluation by Ieſus Chriſt, for the kingdome of heauen, as elſewhere, and ſo in this chapter, is in diuers regards compared and reſembled diuerſly. In regard of the manner of teaching and receiuing it, and the diuers ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:16609:53"/>
it hath in the hearers, it is compared to ſeed caſt by the hand of the ſower. In regard of diuers corruptions and errors that commonly ſpring vp together with it, where it is taught it is compared <hi>vnto a field, wherein</hi> tares are ſowen and grow vp among the good corne. In regard of the ſmall beginnings and mightie encreaſe, it is compared to a graine of muſtard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeed. In reſpect of the power and force it hath to change and to alter the heart, it is compared to leauen. In that God draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth by it, of all ſorts of men, good and bad, one and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the compaſſe of the viſible Church, it is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to a drag or draw-net, that draweth as well weeds and ſtickes, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch vnprofitable baggage, as it doth good fiſh. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the hidden and ſecret excellencie thereof, it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to treaſure hid in a field. In regard of the inualuable worth and excellency of it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>In this place it is compared to a pearle.</hi>
                  </note> in compariſon of all other things, it is heere compared to a pearle of great price. That before he compared it to treaſure, it did in part ſet forth the excellency of it: but this doth more amplifie and encreaſe it. Treaſure, we know, conſiſteth either in ſiluer or in gold, which are of great account: but yet pearles paſſe them both farre, in value and eſtimation; as both it is commonly knowne, and if we knew it not, <hi>Salomon</hi> could teach vs thus much, Prou. 3.14.15. where he ſaith; the <hi>merchandize of wiſdome is better then the merch indize of ſiluer, and the reuenue thereof better then gold. It is more precious then pearles, and all the things thou canſt deſire are not to be compared with it.</hi> Firſt, he preferreth wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome before ſiluer. Secondly, he preferreth it before gold, which is yet more excellent; and in the third place, as before the moſt excellent, he preferreth it before pearles.</p>
               <p>The meaning of our Sauiour then in this parable, is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the Goſpell in regard of the excellencie of it, infinitly before all other things, were they neuer ſo rich, rare, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. For if it be more precious then pearles, then much more precious then gold, then ſiluer, then any other thing of leſſe reckoning and account. And this is the reaſon, why <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> hauing preferred it,<note place="margin">Prou. 3.14.</note> Prou. 3.14. before ſiluer and gold, and pearles, he addeth, that all the things a man can deſire, are not to be compared with it: as if he ſhould ſay, ſuppoſe
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:16609:53"/>
either there be, or you can inuent any thing more precious then pearles, yet wiſdome is more precious then it. And <hi>Iob</hi> in the 28. of his booke, 15. verſe, and ſo-on,<note place="margin">Iob. 28.15.</note> becauſe hee would extol wiſdome before al precious things, he repeateth a great many of them. <hi>Gold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall not be giuen for it; neither ſhall ſiluer be weighed for the price thereof. It ſhall not be valued with the wedge of the gold of Ophir, nor with the precious Onix, nor the Saphir; the gold, nor the Crystall ſhall not be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall vnto it, neither ſhall the exchange be for plate of fine gold; no mention ſhall be made of the Corall nor of the Gabiſh, for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is more precious then pearles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now we ſee wherein the compariſon ſtandeth,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Wherein this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of it conſisteth.</hi>
                  </note> let vs a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle conſider wherin this great and inualuable excellency con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth. And that is, in that it exhibiteth Chriſt vnto vs, who were loſt, and had no way any hope of recouerie out of our deadly woe, that euen then he is our deliuerer, our iewell, our life, our ioy, our happines, and whatſoeuer our heart can deſire. All the pearles of the world do not ſo enrich a man,<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2. Philip. 2. Iohn 4.10.</note> as Chriſt enricheth all them that by true faith lay hold vpon him, for if it do not ſo, he hath not faith. For Chriſt is a ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where we that bee in tempeſts and ſtormes may ſhroud our ſelues, and be ſafe from the wrath and vengeance of God that hangeth ouer, and ſhal fall vpon the heads of other men. He is our attonement and propitiation for all our ſins, ſo that we ſhall neuer haue them imputed vnto vs, or haue any pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment inflicted which was due for them, his death, and his bloodſhed hath deliuered vs from eternall death and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; yea Chriſt is our ſtorehouſe, and treaſurie, in whom and from whom we haue all varietie of good things that may make men truly happie.</p>
               <p>In Chriſt we are righteous (our owne righteouſnes being as a filthie and menſtruous cloath) becauſe he by imputation, doth cloath and couer vs, as it were with the robe and veſture of his righteouſneſſe. From him alſo we receiue inward ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification and holineſſe, wherein we labour to be pleaſing and acceptable to God in all things, whereas otherwiſe we could not haue any true euidence of this faith. From him we receiue ſuccor and comfort in all our tribulations and wants,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:16609:54"/>
and ioy in all our ſorrow. Hee hath all power giuen him in heauen and in earth, and therefore he will ſupplie both our outward and inward neceſſities, and powre vpon vs that ſtore of his graces, as ſhall be moſt for our good, and beſt for the bringing of vs to eternall glorie.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Haue ſhewed in the former Sermon what it is, that the hearer hath found, when it is ſaid of him, that he hath found the pearle of great price. Now let vs ſee, what it is to find this pearle. To find the pearle of the Goſpell, which is the next thing that I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to ſpeake of in this ſecond propertie of the hearer, is nothing elſe, but by the powerfull hearing thereof, to ſee and to perceiue, what excellent and worthie graces, benefits and prerogatiues it conferreth vnto ſuch as feele great need thereof, and that Chriſt is thereby to be made theirs, that hee may bee a defence and protection vnto them to ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them from the wrath of his Father; that he may looſe the bands and chaines, wherewith they are tied and faſt fettered in their ſinnes to the will of the diuell: and that he may vnite them in ſoule, and in bodie, to himſelfe and to God. In a word, the Goſpell layeth out moſt plainly the way to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life.</p>
               <p>The due and ſerious beholding, and conſideration of theſe and infinit other graces depending vpon theſe, which God by the hand of the Goſpell reacheth out, and offereth vnto vs, is the firſt finding of this pearle, which many heare a long time, and yet neuer ſee thus much, I meane the beautie of it. And ſo long as men do in hearing, neuer ſee and behold this admirable and vnualuable treaſure in it, they haue not yet found the pearle of great price. For the Goſpell howſoeuer
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:16609:54"/>
it be in the declaration of the many good things of it, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually ſounded in their eares, yet it is a myſtery hidde, and ſecret to their vnderſtanding.</p>
               <p>The Goſpell is, to all ſuch as yet, as the light of the ſunne to the man that is ſtarke blind. The ſunne, it ſhineth vpon the blinde man, as it doth vpon the ſeeing man, but the blinde he hath no greater benefit of the mid-day, then hee hath of the midnight, and therefore for himſelfe he careth not for the ſunne, in reſpect of any light hee hath by it, becauſe hee is blind: So the light of the Goſpell, it ſhineth vpon the blind and vpon them that ſee: the faithfull, and vnfaithfull: but here is the difference. The one hath the eies of his vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding opened by the ſpirit of God, though it be but a common gift of the ſpirit, and hee ſees the light of the Goſpell, and accounts and priſeth it at a great reckoning: But the other cannot diſcerne any whit of the excellencie of it.</p>

               <p>And ſuch as God loueth; ſhal, though they haue not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time looked after it, but haue been worldly minded; they ſhall, I ſay, haue their eyes opened to ſee into the beautie, power, neceſſity, and comfort of this Goſpell, and what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe it bringeth, by hearing it preached; which to doe, is to finde it: Yea he whom God will ſaue ſhall bee brought to heare, if not otherwiſe, by father, ſonne, friend, neighbour, himſelfe not intending any ſuch thing.

               <p>Therfore it followes, that the wiſe Merchant went by and by and ſolde all that he had, and bought that pretious pearle. And here I will paſſe to the third point, and ſhew how the good hearer is herein like to the merchant man, as he hath reſembled him in both the former, that is, in ſeeking good pearles, and finding one of great price.</p>

It is ſaid, he went his way and ſold al that he had, and bought that pearle. This go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away firſt ſheweth, that he did not ſtand ſtill to muſe, doubt, and linger out the time; but as a wiſe marchant, ſoe ſoone as he ſeeth a penyworth to be bought, which may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich

                  </note>And this teacheth vs, that we are not to linger, nor deferre the time, when God reueileth any excellent fruite, or benefit that the Goſpell bringeth vnto vs; but preſently goe our way, and endeuour to make it our owne. But how rarely ſhal we finde this to be done, when for the moſt part euery where men practiſe the contrary? Many ſee, and will confeſſe, that there is in the Goſpell moſt precious treaſure and worthy to be imbraced; but they thinke the time too ſoone as yet to goe about it: when they haue followed their other pleaſures and delights, in their youthfull dayes: or when they haue obtained theſe or thoſe purpoſes of theirs, then they will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine the Goſpell, and ſell their other delights for it: euen as he who would firſt goe bury his father (which Chriſt reproued) and then he would follow him. And thus it comes to paſſe vſually with theſe men, as it doeth with care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and vnthrifty marchants, that ſlacke, defer, and driue off the time of their commodity whiles it is to be had, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent them after, when it is too late.</p>
               <p>So theſe men, they defer and delay the time, in which God ſetteth out the pearle of the Goſpell, as it were to ſale, that they may buy it at a ſmall, and eaſie reckoning, vntill the market of God be done, and the day of grace be paſt, that they cannot then haue it, would they neuer ſoe gladly. For as wiſdom calleth and crieth vnto men a long time, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be entertained of them, for their owne good: Soe wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome threatneth; that ſhe will refuſe to heare them in the middeſt of their trouble,<note place="margin">Prou. 1.20.</note> and in the day wherein affliction and anguiſh, ſhall, like a whirlewind, come vppon them: Though they cry neuer ſo loude, and ſeeke her neuer ſo ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, ſhe will not anſwer, nor be found of them.</p>

For there is no equality be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene all that we haue, or can haue, and betweene the kingdome of heauen; but in things that are bought there is ſome equality betweene the price, and the thing that is bought. So that if they by their almes, or good works what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer, be able to purchaſe heauen at Gods hand, it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that they are as profitable to God, and benefit him as much by their almes, and other good workes, as he by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, doth benefit them.</p>
               <p>But we know the doctrine of our Sauiour, when we haue done all we can do, though we giue al our ſubſtance, yea and our owne life for Gods glory, we muſt ſay, and acknowledge, as the truth is, <hi>we are but vnprofitable ſeruants</hi> vnto him.<note place="margin">Luk. 17.10.</note>

                  </note>The meaning therefore we ſee clearely to be this, he that getteth the pearle of the Goſpell, he prizeth it farre aboue all the things he hath beſides in the world, and will rather for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go them all, then part with it. Hence we ſee that the pearle of the Goſpell is not ſo eaſily come by, as men ſuppoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly. For it is no eaſy matter, as experience may teach, when triall is made, for a man, to abandon his pleaſures, to leeſe his goods, to forſake his deareſt, and neareſt friends, and to lay downe his owne life for the loue of it. But the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell it can be bought with no leſſe price; if we will haue it as our owne iewel, we muſt ſell goods, ſell our name, ſel friends, ſell liberty and life, and all we haue, and giue them for it: and account that we haue made a very good bargaine of it, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede we haue.</p>
               <p>For what compariſon is to be made betweene the earthly riches, that here men enioy, and thoſe vnſpeakeable and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable treaſures that Chriſt Ieſus bringeth vnto vs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by? what compariſon betweene that name we can leeſe here for the Goſpell, and the eternall weight, and crowne of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that ſhal be ſet vpon our heads in heauen? what is the loue and friendſhip of all men, to the loue and fauour of God;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:16609:57"/>
which we gaine by the Goſpell? and what is the life we can leeſe, to the life which we obtaine in Chriſt? And yet if we trie and examine our ſelues, we ſhall find that we come farre ſhort of forſaking all; when we are priuie in our ſelues, that a little pleaſure doth many times ſtay vs from the hearing of the Goſpell, and how much more then from obeying it? And that a little expence and charge ſhall hinder vs, or ill compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie ſhall hold and keepe vs away from the benefit which we might enioy by it.</p>
               <p>Nay our hearts can tell vs, that many times when we are preſent with our bodies, where it is preached, yet we ſcarce will vouchſafe to lend our eares, to harken to that which is taught vnto vs, but our mind is ſet vpon other matters, either on profit or pleaſure, or elſe ſome vaine, idle and wandring conceits, or elſe we euen ſhamefully giue our ſelues to ſleepe. So baſe and vile account and reckoning do we make of the precious and vnualuable pearle of the Goſpell.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>As men price the Gospell, ſo will their zeale be to the hearing and practiſing of it.</hi>
                  </note> For accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly as men price it, ſo vndoubtedly will their zeale be to the hearing and practiſing of it.</p>
               <p>And therefore marke how <hi>Dauid</hi> bewailes his abſence from the houſe of God: he was baniſhed the court, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, yet that did not ſo much moue him, as this,<note place="margin">Pſalme 84.1.</note> that he was barred and baniſhed from the place, where he vſed with ioy to feed vpon the comforts of the word of God, taught and preached in the aſſemblies of Gods people: and this made him ſay with griefe, that the ſparrowes and the ſwallow might haue nearer acceſſe then he, to the place where God was ſerued, and his word preached. This he did, becauſe he ſaw Gods word to be of more true value then all his thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of gold and ſiluer, of more ſound delight to his ſoule, then all his other delights and pleaſures in the world. It was as hony to his taſte, and as the ſtreames of a fountaine to the thirſtie and drie heart. This ſhould we all do, and this would we do if we were wiſe, and did rightly price the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>And although I haue not particularly ſet downe thoſe things which accompany the buying of this pearle, becauſe the text giueth no neceſſarie occaſion of ſpeaking of them; yet in the way of preoccupation, and anſwering a doubt,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:16609:58"/>
which the ignoranter ſort would put forth, I will ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, though very briefly of it. They aske, if as ſoone as a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> find the pearle, he by and by that buyeth it, come into the poſſeſſion of it, and nothing elſe be required thereto: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere briefly, when a man hath found it, if God giue him grace, to go further, he doth thus, and goeth to worke after this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>How a man ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the pearle his owne.</hi>
                  </note>He earneſtly wiſheth and deſireth that he had a part in it: then he ſeeth that his ſinne is in the way to hinder him, that he falleth to diſlike and crying out of it: then it troubleth him to thinke, that he is out of fauour with God, and growes vtterly to diſlike himſelfe for both: and ſeeing himſelfe no better then a loſt man, hee heareth that God will pitie and ſhew mercie to ſuch, and that hee is then the perſon whom God ſeeketh to ſaue, and will heale him of his ſorrow: and will loue him freely for euer. And that it is the Goſpel which bringeth tidings of this, and ſundrie other good things, which when he apprehendeth, and ſees, that he may haue them all for his owne proper good, and that freely, and for nothing; God ſo worketh in him by all theſe, that he appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the promiſes to himſelfe, and ſeeth that without money or recompence, God is well pleaſed that he ſhould take them for his owne, and be fully perſwaded thereof, ſo as now he reſteth therein, which is the purchaſing and buying of it, that is heere ſpoken of.</p>
               <p>And when this is thus brought to paſſe, let all that know what this meaneth, gueſſe how he will loue the Lord for this bountie ſhewed vpon him, and how readie he will be to be guided by him, and alſo what comfort it is to him. But for concluſion of the whole, now that ye haue heard, that the hearer who ſhall be able to reioyce in his worke at the end thereof, is fitly reſembled to the merchant man, as we haue heard, firſt in that he ſeeketh pearles, ſecondly, in finding one of great price; and thirdly, in ſelling all that he hath to buy it; that is to make it his owne; that he may be happie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and all this is done, when he beginneth to beleeue; let him be ſure he doth ſo, and let him get many grounds, and euidences thereof, by the Scripture, and experience. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:16609:58"/>
all other this vnualuable treaſure of the forgiueneſſe of his ſins, and aſſurance of ſaluation, he beleeuing the Lord, that he may be bold to lay hold on it, as Gods will is hee ſhould.</p>
               <p>And let him well weigh how much he is bound to him for it, and ſo doing, let him liue on his purchaſe, and take the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit thereof, to the comfort of him and his, no otherwiſe then they do, that haue bought houſe and land. And euery day weigh the fruit of ſuch a purchaſe in true and vnfained peace and comfort, and ſeeing he ſhall liue vnder ſo kind and good a Lord, as he that is Lord of all lords,<note place="margin">Deut. 28.46.</note> let it moue him to ſet his heart on him, and delight and endeuour to pleaſe and obey him in all things, and let him do it alſo with ioy.</p>
               <p>For why? if we thinke, they that be in a noble mans houſe, faring well, may be merrie, is there any ſuch merry-making, as in Gods houſe? ſo that the man may be merry at his work, and the woman at hers? They that powre water on the hands of a Prince, or a King, are thought happie: but then to haue the honor that is greater then Kings? is ſomewhat. And by this little that hath been ſaid of, and about the pearle, gueſſe what the reſt is, euen as yee would gueſſe of the whole proportion of a man by ſeeing his foot.</p>

               <p>Theſe things I purpoſe chiefely to teach; and with all ſuch as ſhall be appertaining hereunto, as the text ſhall giue occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But yet you muſt vnderſtand that they are the matters which the Prophet alſo propoundeth to teach out of theſe words, which I haue read. For otherwiſe, my teaching of this, without ground and warrant from him, ſhould be to ſmall purpoſe. And that I may ſhew this to be his full meaning, I will firſt open and vnfold the words which are there ſet downe, which being borrowed ſpeeches, and not ſignifying that which the letter and words do import, do make the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeeme more difficult, and harder to be vnderſtood, vnleſſe they ſhould be opened and made plaine.</p>
               <p>We are therfore to know, that by thirſting (when he ſaith,<note place="margin">

Thus the ſenſe of the words, in which any difficultie lieth, being cleare, it may eaſily be gathered what the meaning of the whole verſe is; and that is this. That whoſoeuer feeleth ſuch need of the food of eternall life, and of the graces of faith, hope, pardon of ſinne, loue, patience, or the like; if he feele ſuch need of them, I ſay, that he cannot be ſatisfied without them, he may (how vnworthie ſoeuer he thinke himſelfe thereof;) freely, confidently and with Gods good liking, enioy, and take his part in them; euen as he that buyeth houſe or land with his money, may poſſeſſe the ſame ſafely as his owne.

                  </note>To ſpeake of theſe three points as they lie in order, and to begin with the firſt; we ſee that it is an high degree of profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the ſchoole of Chriſt, and a token of Gods loue, to thirſt, and earneſtly to long after heauenly things, as grace and eternall life. For they who doe ſo, muſt needs haue knowledge to diſcerne the price and excellency of them, and alſo feele their owne need and neceſſity of them, that they doe but pine, and are as it were ſtarued for want of them. And for all this, who are more contemptible either in theit owne eyes, or the eyes of others, then ſuch be? And yet theſe are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led forth by the prophet (as we ſee) from amongſt all other (while they with the Publican thinke themſelues to be a farre off, and looke for no ſuch thing) to inioy, and be parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of that which is the beſt of all other.<note place="margin">Luk. 18.13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And after the ſame maner ſpeaketh the holy Ghoſt in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture,<note place="margin">Ioh. 7.37.</note> as in the Goſpell by S. <hi>Iohn: If any man thirſt, let him come to me and drinke</hi>; meaning the ſame that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet here doth. And our Sauiour in another place, vttereth the ſame more plainely and fully, though not in the ſame words,<note place="margin">Luk. 5.31.</note> ſaying: <hi>The whole haue no need of the Phyſitian, but

the ſicke.</hi> And againe:<note place="margin">Mat. 9.13.</note> 
                  <hi>I came not to call the righteous</hi> (who ſo thinke themſelues) <hi>but the ſinner to repentance.</hi> So that to thirſt for grace, is no common grace of God, and according to the price that the holy Ghoſt ſets it at, it aduanceth them that haue it, farre aboue many floriſhers, who yet beare no ſmall ſhew of religion and goodnes.</p>
               <p>And this I doe aduiſedly and willingly teach and publiſh for their ſakes, who through Gods goodnes haue attained to this grace in ſome good meaſure, and yet feare, that they are of all other moſt miſerable. That they may ſee Gods mercy farre greater to them, then they can be perſwaded, that it is. But while they thus meanly account of their eſtate which is right happie: yet I know there are other, who come farre ſhort of them, in feruent deſiring of holy and heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly things, and haue onely a deſire to heare preaching at ſome time, and (as they ſay) in their good moode, and otherwiſe are as vaine and vnprofitable as others, who yet will be ready to thinke themſelues to be they of whom the Prophet here ſpeaketh; as it commeth to paſſe too co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly, that they apply amiſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The firſt is, what are the true properties of thirſting. Secondly, the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes why God requires it. Thirdly, how long we muſt thirſt. Fourthly, how we may beſt come to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Concerning the firſt, the properties of it may beſt be ſeene by conſidering them in the naturall thirſt,<note place="margin">1. <hi>The properties of it, which are two.</hi>
                  </note> and namely theſe two: the one, that he which thirſteth, doth moſt hartily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire drinke, ſo as he cannot be quiet, but through the hope of it: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The other (which alſo is conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to it) is, that if it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, he can do nothing, but is ready to faint for want of it.
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:16609:61"/>
Both are moſt clearely to be ſeene in <hi>Sampſons</hi> thirſt, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſlaine a thouſand men of the Philiſtims with the Iawe boane of an aſſe, was ſore a thirſt and called on the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſaid:<note place="margin">Iudg. 15.18.</note>

               <p>Now to apply theſe to the ſpirituall thirſt, he is truely ſaid to thirſt for the pardon of his ſinnes, for eternall life, or any grace of ſanctification; not who deſireth and prayeth for them, but yet can goe his way without them, or the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and aſſurance of them, and yet can be well contented: but he who fainteth in his ſoule for want of them, neither can goe about any thing readily, nor in kind, without ſome true perſwaſion of inioying them.

Neither was this ſo with them onely in a mood, and for a ſeaſon, (for ſo a wicked man may deſire heauenly things alſo) but this continued, till they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their deſire, and as they obtained one good thing, they thirſted for another, (as I ſhal haue occaſion to ſhew af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards) and alſo for a greater meaſure of that grace which they had already.</p>
               <p>And this thirſting in Gods people condemneth that which goeth for it in many,<note place="margin">

And yet ſeeing either they cannot, or will not learne to put difference betwixt the one and the other, that is the true thirſt, &amp; that which is deceiuable; they are far wide, thinking that they haue that kinde and right thirſting after ſpirituall foode of the ſoule; when yet by this that hath bin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid of this matter, it is manifeſt, that they are farre from it; if it were but for this cauſe, that they giue ouer ſeeking, before they haue found the grace which they ſeemed to thirſt for. And this be ſaid of the properties of thirſting, the firſt of the foure things which I ſet downe. And this ought to teach vs not to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile, when we ſee many to fall away from their zeale, who haue ſeemed forward; becauſe it was neuer aright planted in them.</p>
               <p>The ſecond point followeth, namely,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Secondly, the cauſes why God requireth this thirſting.</hi>
                  </note> the cauſes why God requireth this thirſting to be in vs, that cannot be in any but in his ſeruants. And the cauſes are ſpecially three. The firſt, ſeeing it muſt be ſutable to the bodily thirſt. The ſeco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, if we thirſted not we could not haue the variety of good things,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:16609:62"/>
which are hoarded vp in the word for vs to make vs happy, foraſmuch as they are drawne out from thence no other way but by thirſting after them: and by it we are made partakers of them, as the bleſſed Virgine ſaith in her ſong: The <hi>Lord filleth the hungry with good things,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 1.53.</note> 
                  <hi>and ſendeth the rich, or full, empty away,</hi> which is the cauſe why the poore people of God doe ſhew their thirſting deſire not onely many other wayes, but alſo by this, namely, in their ordinary labour and trauaile to heare the word of God preached, &amp; that ſundry miles off from their dwelling place, if they haue it not there; though it be with mocking and taunting them for it, by ſuch as are far from thirſting after it themſelues.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third cauſe why God requireth thirſting, is becauſe we ſhould otherwiſe neuer know how exceedingly we are beholding to him for the variety of grace, and good things which we receiue thereby fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him: as faith, patience, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenes of ſins &amp;c.<note place="margin">Pro. 27.7.</note> For ſo <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith in the Prouerbs: <hi>The perſon that is full deſpiſeth an hony combe: but vnto the hungry ſoule, euery bitter thing is ſweete.</hi> So that we feeling ſuch neede of them, as that our ſoules ſhould faint and be ſtarued with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, we ſee and acknowledge that, which we could not haue done without it, neither would eaſily beleeue it, namely that the Lord loueth vs dearely, and that his mercy is great towards vs, yea and that in things of the beſt kind, which others hauing offered them of God as well as we, doe ſet no ſtore by them: and all becauſe they feele no want of them, but could (as they thinke) be well enough without them. And thus much of the cauſes of thirſting.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Thirdly, how long we muſt thirſt.</hi>
                  </note>The third followeth, and that is, how long wee ſhould thirſt. For it ſeemeth vnreaſonable to many, that we ſhould be held alwaies at one point: as that either we ſhould euer be thirſting for one grace; or if that be not required of vs, yet that we ſhould bee thirſting ſtill after ſome other. To the which the anſwere is, that we muſt alwaies be thirſting, euen ſo long as God hath any good grace to giue, and till he be wearie of beſtowing vpon vs. Which ſeeing it ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be, while we remaine heere, God being a wel-ſpring and fountaine of all good things neuer drawne drie, and more
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:16609:62"/>
readie to giue, then we to aske; it is for our ſingular benefit, and not a bondage, that we may be alwaies thirſting, for ſo long there is ſtil ſome good comming towards vs: and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we were not liable to the liberall offer which God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth heere by the Prophet, neither were we the perſons to whom he ſpeaketh, in ſaying: <hi>Ho, euery one that thirsteth, come to the waters and drinke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But yet this I ſay further, that in this manner we ſhould thirſt, namely, for any grace, till we receiue it, if it be heere to be enioyed; or a ſure grant of it, if we cannot partake it heere, that in the life to come we ſhal haue it: and we are not to thinke that when we haue obtained any gift or grace of God, that we are commanded ſtill to be asking of one and the ſame thing, which to do were againſt common ſenſe and reaſon; but for a greater meaſure of it, as encreaſe of faith, loue and patience, when we haue alreadie receiued a part in them: and for ſuch things as we yet want, with the like ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite to deſire and thirſt for them, as at the firſt anguiſh of mind and wound of conſcience, we did long for the forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our ſinnes. And this of the time how long we ought to thirſt, which is the third point in this firſt part.</p>
               <p>The fourth followeth, namely, how we ſhould come to thirſting, and how it ſhould be vpholden;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Fourthly, how we ſhould come to thirst.</hi>
                  </note> which being ſuch a worthie gift of God, had not need to be neglected; but as an appetite to bodily food for the preſeruing of health, is by all meanes to be maintained and ſought. The meanes are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther coſtly, nor hard to come by, as in bodily dainties it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, but readie and at hand. Euen to ſee our wants in grace, and emptines thereof; as how weake our faith is, how faint our hope, how cold our loue, and how hardly we haue proofe of our patience. Alſo to obſerue our corruptions; as touchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, frowardnes, vncleane deſires, wrath, deſire of reuenge, &amp;c. and in what bondage they hold vs. If we obſerue theſe in our ſelues,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 2.2.</note> they will make vs <hi>deſire the ſincere milke of the Word</hi> to guide vs aright: alſo to watch and pray, ſigh and groane, that we may reſiſt the euill, and nouriſh the good. For as the husbandman by toiling and ſweating at hay and harueſt, prouoketh the bodily thirſt; ſo we labouring with
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:16609:63"/>
our hearts to plucke vp, and to plant, as there ſhall be cauſe, ſhall thirſt till wee obtaine that which wee goe about and deſire.</p>
               <p>And God who calleth vs to it, and promiſeth largely to ſatisfie vs, will not mocke vs, but do as he hath ſaid, that is to ſay, ſatisfie our ſoules with good things. And thus we come to thirſt. But when we ſee our hearts thus poſſeſſed and taken vp with the feruent and conſtant deſire of the good things which we would haue, we muſt alſo be perſwaded, to labour readily and willingly, as need ſhall require, whether it be by prayer, conference or the like, to obtaine them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that which is ſaid in the Pſalme,<note place="margin">Pſal. 111.2.</note> 
                  <hi>that wiſdome</hi> (and ſo all the parts thereof) <hi>is to be ſought out</hi> (that is, with all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence) <hi>of thoſe that haue pleaſure therein.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But one obiection heere I will anſwere, which troubleth ſome, and that is, that they ſay: In the beginning when men turne to God firſt, they thirſt, and cannot be ſatisfied to their quiet and contentment, but they ſee no ſuch thing in them after. I anſwere, though all ſhew it not after, as they did at firſt, by complaining, asking queſtions, and lamenting their wants to other, yet they long and thirſt for that which they ſee needfull for them, and yet wanting: but they do not ſhew it ſo much; and that is wiſdome, which other vnexperienced, and more weake in knowledge and faith, cannot do, but muſt ſhew their thirſting, as I ſaid; and it may be perceiued of themſelues to be ſo, by their daily care and diligence to nouriſh the old grace they haue alreadie, and to obtaine new; and by the courſe of their life, it may be perceiued of others, but if they grow full, they be in ill caſe.</p>
               <p>Thus the firſt branch of the three in this firſt part hath bin handled, namely, who they are whom God calleth out by the Prophet, from the reſt of the people, to take part in the beſt tidings that euer were, or can be brought from him: and that is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The ſecond branch: what God offereth to them that thirst.</hi>
                  </note> all ſuch as thirſt. The ſecond branch followeth, and that is, what are the good things that they ſhall haue which thirſt. The benefit which they ſhall enioy, is anſwerable to their thirſt, euen the thing which they thirſt for, for the Lords anſwere is, that he will quench it. If they thirſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:16609:63"/>
for remiſſion of their ſins, and cannot be ſatisfied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, they ſhall partake that. If for faith to apprehend it, and by which they may know they are forgiuen, that ſhall bee granted them alſo. If for eternall life, they ſhall enioy it in due time, when they haue waited a while patiently; and the ſame I ſay of the manifold graces of the Spirit, which are here reſembled by this bodily refreſhing, which quencheth the thirſt thereof, namely, milke, water, and wine.</p>
               <p>And to tarrie a little in this ſecond branch, to prooue the ſame, as ſomewhat hath been ſaid of the firſt, I will beginne with that which worthily deſerueth the firſt place, namely, how God promiſeth the remitting of all ſin, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaluation for euer, to all that thirſt for it. The word of God is plentifull in prouing that he doth ſo. As that of our Sauiour in Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>If any thirst,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iohn 7.37.</note> 
                  <hi>let him come to me and drinke.</hi> Why then, if his thirſt be for this; euen this hee may take by Chriſts free grant, and comfort himſelfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. In the eleuenth of <hi>Matthew</hi> he meaneth the ſame in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther words, where he ſaith, <hi>Come to me all ye that trauell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 11.28.</note> 
                  <hi>and be loaden, and I will eaſe you.</hi> Now ſearch out his meaning, how can he eaſe burdened conſciences, troubled for the feare of Gods wrath, which is due thereto, but he muſt take away the guilt of their ſinne, and the puniſhment due to it, by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning and remitting it, as if it had neuer been committed? And by theſe meanes, he doth eaſe the greateſt torment that euer vexed the ſoule of man. Therefore the afflicted perſon may be bold with reuerence to take this, and ſuch like Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to the quieting of his diſtreſſed mind, and to the put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away of his intollerable vnquietneſſe, which before op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed him. And euen ſo do the faithfull ſeruants of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his mind and will to people in the like caſe.<note place="margin">Act. 2.37.</note> As <hi>Peter</hi> in the ſecond of the Acts, when certaine men were pricked in conſcience for their ſinne, and came to him and the other A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, ſaying, (in the anguiſh of their hearts) <hi>men and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, what ſhall we do,</hi> he anſwered in effect, thus: Seeke to haue your ſinnes forgiuen you, and to know that it is ſo, by the ſignes which Chriſt hath left therof, &amp; ye may reſt quiet. But how could they ſeeke that, if Chriſt had not giuen them
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:16609:64"/>
libertie both to do ſo, and alſo to find it?</p>
               <p>By all which, it is cleare, that our Sauiour hath prouided a moſt gracious helpe and remedie to all afflicted conſciences, and which is all one therewith, (that I may keepe in your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance the manner of ſpeech ſet downe in our text) doth promiſe vpon his faithfulneſſe, that he will quench this thirſt of longing for Gods fauour, and the pardon of ſin, in whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer it ſhall be found.</p>

made: that it is to the greater honor of God, that he will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome mens euill with good; leauing to vs an example therein, that we ſhould follow and be like to him, and that he ſent his Sonne into the world for them that be vngodly and vnworthie. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And for the ſecond part of the obiection,<note place="margin">Rom. 5.6.</note> that ſo large and precious a promiſe is made to the bare thirſting after the loue of God and eternall life, without any leauing and forſaking of ſinne; to this point I require diligent obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of mine anſwere. I ſay therefore, that all things cannot be mentioned at once in handling ſome points of holy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, leſt we ſhould thereby fall into confuſedneſſe. Neither in handling plainly this of thirſting, is it neceſſarie to ſpeake of the renouncing or purpoſing againſt ſinne, otherwiſe then in the way of preoccupation, that is, the anſwering of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection, as heere I do. Therefore to this part of the obiection,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>He that thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth truely for ſaluation, abhors ſinne.</hi>
                  </note> I anſwere, that he who thirſteth truely for ſaluation, cannot do it without the abhorring of the ſin, which hath been moſt delighted in. For while we deſire grace, we abhor ſin, which is contrarie to it, and this thirſting after the water of life, ſhal <hi>drie</hi> vp the heate of ſin by little and little, no otherwiſe, then the hot and ſcorching ſunne doth the moiſt and ſoft puddle. I meane ſo farre as the ſimilitude ſerueth for this purpoſe. And therefore, let any make this good, that he thirſteth, and I will make it good by the word of God, that his thirſt ſhall be quenched, and his ſinnes pardoned.</p>
               <p>Now therefore, where are they which ſay, oh, Preachers vrge vs ſo hardly, that we ſhall neuer be able to follow the doctrine they teach vs, of the way to eternall life. I ſay, if the way that we ſet downe be hard, it is through the hardnes of your hearts. For otherwiſe, who would deſire the way to be eaſier, then it is heere ſet downe to be? he that thirſteth after it ſhall haue eternall life. And yet ſeeing it is ſo eaſie, let all, who deſire to be partakers of life, looke well and carefully to this, that they haue no leſſe to teſtifie it to them, then this, namely, that they haue the thirſt which hath been ſet downe to be required.</p>
               <p>And heere for the more full handling of this point,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The third branch: what God requireth of them whoſe thirst he will quench; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</hi>
                  </note> I will enter into the third branch of this firſt part, that is to ſay, what
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:16609:65" rendition="simple:additions"/>
God requireth of them, whoſe thirſt he will quench; and that is, that they <hi>come</hi> to him (for it) that is, beleeue that he will do in deed, as he promiſeth, euen ſatisfie the ſoule of him that thirſteth, with the thing that he deſireth, and therefore with remiſſion of ſinne and ſaluation, if that be the thing he thirſteth after. This faith is that, which the Prophet requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, when he ſpeaketh of comming, requiring it of them that they come. Euen as our Sauiour alſo in Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth the ſame by comming to him, where he maketh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming and beleeuing,<note place="margin">Iohn 9.<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               <p>So that, we ſee it is required heere; that the thirſtie perſons who are by the Prophet called out from all other, to drinke and to be refreſhed, ſhould beleeue that God meaneth as he ſpeaketh, and will do it indeed: which ſtandeth with great reaſon, that they ſhould do ſo. For although the Lord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath and freely grant it vnto them, yet if they weigh it not, and ſo giue no credit to it, how can they be the better for it? Neither need they feare, that they ſhall preſume and be too bold in claſping about and beleeuing it, for while they deſire it,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.33.</note> and God promiſeth to grant them their deſire, who ſhall take it from them?

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:16609:65"/>
the voice of an Angell, they may loue him, and be zealous in his ſeruice, which by no other meanes they could be brought vnto? Therefore let them labour aboue all things that they may haue this perſwaſion of Gods ſauour, and let them ſee, that they haue no leſſe then this vnfained faith in them, though weake, becauſe ſo great and waightie matters are thereby wrought and vpholden in them.</p>
               <p>But heere one thing more I muſt adde,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>How a man may prooue that he hath faith.</hi>
                  </note> though afterwards I ſhall ſay ſomewhat of it. And that is, how a man may proue that he hath this faith? ſeeing it is eaſily doubted of, and moſt of all by them, who haue leaſt cauſe; and this proofe of their faith and teſtimonie thereof, I thinke it moſt fit to ſtay them vp withall, that they may not wauer, as they who haue it not, ſhall do, and muſt needs, though they ſpeake great words a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. And I cannot brieflier nor more pithily do it, then by telling them, that if they hold faſt this precious promiſe of ſaluation by Chriſt, they muſt know that they receiue the ſpirit of ſanctification alſo, which crieth in them Abba, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſanctifieth them, and more plainely thus; that as they deſire the forgiuenes of their ſins, they deſire and ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour after the reformation of their liues, and the weaning of their harts from euill alſo. And this where it is wrought (that I ſay no more of it in this place) ſhall euer prooue, that there is this effectuall faith.</p>
               <p>This I haue ſaid of this firſt part, and the three branches thereof, and namely, of this one kind of their thirſting for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, and eternal life. For there are other thirſtings, then for theſe, as I gaue the Reader to vnderſtand, before; whereof I will giue you a taſte, though more briefly in the next Sermon, ſeeing I haue largely handled this in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned inſtance, that it may giue light to the Reader, that whatſoeuer good things he thirſteth for, he may be as ſure, that he ſhall obtaine them.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow to proceed where I left, we are to know, that Gods people are neuer fully ſatisfied, while they wander heere on earth, but are euer thirſting after one good thing or other, or ſome new meaſure of grace, whatſoeuer they haue been ſatisfied in alreadie: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they could not be included among them, to whom this promiſe is made, neither haue they their part in it, when it is ſaid; <hi>Ho, all ye that thirst, come to the waters and drinke.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From hence it is, that ſome hauing attained to true faith, yet as feruently deſire to preſerue and ſtrengthen the ſame, as they deſired when they were before in great feare and doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to haue any meaſure at all thereof. And ſo the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth, that we highly eſteeme, deſire and long after the ſame, and the ſaluation which we waite for thereby, euen as at the firſt acquaintance with them, we did. In like manner, Gods faithfull people knowing that he is as a flowing foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, rich in all good things, and neuer drawne drie, they thirſt ſtill after other particular graces of the holy Ghoſt, when he hath ſatisfied them with the former. And namely, hope, loue, patience, meekeneſſe, humbleneſſe, ſtrength to beare afflictions, and ſuch like. And he doth no ſooner ſtirre vp in them the deſire and longing after theſe, but he doth withall giue them his word and promiſe, that he will beſtow the ſame vpon them, euen as he heere ſpeaketh, ſaying, <hi>He, all ye that thirst, come to the waters and drinke.</hi> And in like ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he ſpeaketh in <hi>Hoſea,</hi>

longing for his mercie, ſhall obtaine it to couer their ſinnes, they ſhall, as the drie ground thirſteth for the dew and raine, and is ſatisfied therewith, ſo ſhall they (I ſay) be refreſhed with the dew of his grace, to grow vp out of their old ſinnes, floriſhing in his Church, as the plants; conſtantly ſetled ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as the trees deepely rooted, and prouoking others to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and be in loue with their example and good courſe, euen as a ſweet ſmell, or a beautifull creature prouoketh to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king thereof. And that which he ſpeaketh of them, he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of all, which are his true Iſraelites and faithfull people.</p>
               <p>And hereof it is, that they enioy and attaine to many fruits of the ſpirit, becauſe they loue and long much after them, and euery one hath the greater meaſure of them, the more ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly that he beleeueth, God will grant them. And ſo on the contrarie it is verified in others, which is written:<note place="margin">Luke 6.28.</note> 
                  <hi>Wo be to them which are full, for they ſhall hunger; wo be to them that are rich, for they haue their conſolation.</hi> For they who thirſt not for heauenly grace, to refreſh them and make them well liking to God and his people, ſhall turne their thirſt after the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſin, and the vnſauourie froth of their euill hearts, till hauing their fill of them, they caſt vp their ſweet morſels, as their bane and poiſon.</p>

                  </note> that he reproueth not them, whom he before called, in their thirſting after heauenly things, to be ſatisfied therewith. For all may ſee there was no cauſe why he ſhould find fault with them, who did that which he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: but he reproueth them, who did not thirſt nor ſet their delight on the beſt things, telling them, that they beſtowed their labour and trauell vpon that which could not profit, but deceiue them. For by money in this verſe, hee meaneth their precious labour and care: and by bread he meaneth that which in the firſt verſe he did by wine, water and milke, that is, the ſubſtantiall and true nouriſhing food of the ſoule.</p>
               <p>As if he ſhould ſay, why are ye ſo vnthankfull, nay ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully fooliſh, that when God hath freely offered his bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full kindneſſe to you, to drinke of the water of life, you affect it not, but rather reiect it, and in the meane while, wearie and trouble your ſelues about that which cannot ſatisfie or giue you contentment? For to ſpeake as the truth is, men are ſo bewitched by the diuell, that they had rather wander vp and downe in by-wayes and croſſe pathes erroniouſly, and to follow their owne opinions in ſeeking eternall life, till they be wearied; rather then to reſt in the ſafe way which God offereth them.</p>
               <p>And when he hath reproued them for this great fault, he exhorteth them to be wiſer, and to heare him attentiuely in ſhewing them a better way, euen the right and true way to happineſſe, that is, by thirſting after it, as the other did, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the former verſe; and ſo doing, he ſheweth them what a worthie fruit they ſhould reape thereof, euen all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of things worthie to be deſired, and reſt to their ſoules thereby, which he meaneth by that allegoricall ſpeech, when he ſaith, <hi>Eate that which is good, and let your ſoules de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in fatneſſe.</hi> Thus much for the meaning of this verſe: now briefly looke wee into the reproofe and exhortation therein contained, and conſequently what fruit will follow, if they be both regarded.</p>

Whereby he cleerely ſheweth, that there is no other way to find that which they ſeeke. By no wiſedome of man, by no learning, much leſſe by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means of blind deuotion and ſond zeale without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.

               <p>This hearing the Prophet requireth, and hee that heareth not with this mind, nor to this end, he loſeth his labour, and beſtoweth all his trauell in vaine.<label type="milestone">

                  </label> But it will be asked heere, what is that which the Prophet would haue them heare of him, to the end they might proſper, attaine the aſſurance of eternall life, and the happineſſe which they deſired?

                  </label> For anſwere to this, we are to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that in the firſt verſe he ſpake to all the people, and asked among them all, who they were that thirſted: to whom he gaue an anſwere from God, according to their hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that they ſhould be ſatisfied with all ſuch good things as they thirſted for.</p>
               <p>Now in this verſe wee heard hee reproued all the reſt of them that ſought for pardon of their ſins and eternall life, or other graces of the ſpirit amiſſe; euen by their owne wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and fancie, not longing after and thirſting for it, as Gods word teacheth them to doe. Therefore theſe hee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts to heare him, that they would alſo with the other ſet their hearts vpon it, and thirſt after it. Euen this is that which he requires their diligent attention about, that ſo ſeeking it as their brethren did, they might with them find that which they ſought, euen as they had done.</p>
               <p>And this if they doe, they ſhall enioy, he telleth them that good diet, yea and banquetting cheere, which bee meaneth by the allegoricall ſpeeches which he vſeth heere, when hee ſaith, <hi>then they ſhall eate that which is good, and their ſoule ſhall be ſatisfied with fatneſſe.</hi> Whereby he meaneth, that as a man which is kept at a good diet with wholeſom good &amp; ſauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie meats, is healthfull and well liking in body; euen ſo ſhall his ſoule be ſatiate and filled withal variety of heauenly dain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,

and be made ioyfull and well liking thereby, which with an appetite doth ſeeke the ſame.</p>
               <p>And ſo all they find it, who are euer thirſting after one good thing or other: this being added, that they beleeue God vpon his word, and doubt not but that it ſhall bee ſo. Which I adde to quicken vp many of my deere brethren and ſiſters heereunto.

And for this cauſe I haue choſen this Scripture, which giueth ſingular good occaſion to vs all, to conſider aduiſedly of the ſame.</p>
               <p>To the which purpoſe I will firſt lay open the words of our Sauiour Chriſt vnto the cities heere named, they being the ground of that which I meane to deliuer vnto you, and then proceed in the doctrine which they fitly giue occaſion of, and ſhew the vſe thereof.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The opening of the text.</hi>
                  </note> Our Lord Ieſus therefore being borne in Bethlehem, brought vp in Nazareth, but hauing his chiefe habitation and abode neare to theſe cities, Corazin and Bethſaida, namely in Capernaum, in which three he had
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:16609:70"/>
preached moſt, and done moſt of his miracles, when he ſaw that they were little regarded there, he was moued in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of them, by reaſon of the danger they lay in for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of ſo great fauour as was offered to them, rather then to many other cities, to caſt in their teeth their groſſe and great vnthankfulneſſe. And as they had encreaſed their ſinne more then others, ſo to ſhame them for it, he aggraua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, by making their condition worſe then their neighbour cities, vpon whom he had beſtowed no ſuch coſt nor bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits; Tyre and Sidon I meane, whom they counted to be moſt odious, and knew them to be moſt diſſolute, and for their wicked liues infamous. And therefore he ſpake thus vnto them, <hi>Wo to thee (Corazin); wo to thee (Bethſaida); for if the great workes which haue been done in you, had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they had repented long agone in ſackcloth and aſhes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much be ſaid of Chriſts words to theſe cities, and of the occaſion thereof: now I will lay forth the chiefe points of them which miniſter matter of inſtruction vnto vs,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The parts two.</hi>
                  </note> and they are drawne from the generall partes of the text, which are two: For in Chriſts words now read vnto you, there are theſe two; the one a curſe pronounced vpon them,<note place="margin">1. <hi>The curſe pronounced vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe cities. 2. The reaſon of it.</hi>
                  </note> in theſe words, <hi>Wo to thee</hi>; the other a reaſon of the ſame, in theſe words, <hi>For if the great workes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Both of theſe affoord three particular branches a peece, vpon the which I meane to ſtand; and they are theſe: In the former three, firſt, that many great workes had beene done amongſt them, which might haue wrought repentance in them: ſecondly, that although they had them amongſt them, yet they repented not: thirdly, therefore he pronounceth the woe vpon them. In the latter generall part, namely, the reaſon; theſe three are to be conſidered: Firſt, that many, if they had enioyed them, had repented indeed: Secondly, they would not (he ſaith) haue driuen off from day to day, but would haue done it long agoe: Thirdly, in a moſt hearty and ſolemne manner; that is to ſay, in ſackecloth and aſhes.</p>
               <p>And out of theſe ſixe points in Chriſts wordes,<note place="margin">

                  </label> I ſay againe, neither haue we any need of them; which being then wrought for the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the doctrine which was preached by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, I meane the doctrine of the Goſpell, do as well ſerue now to confirme it, being the ſame in the preaching of euery faithfull and true Miniſter. And as for preaching, ſeeing it is the ſame it was then, and a farre greater worke then the doing of miracles, we are to know, that whereſoeuer the Lord is pleaſed to haue it ſoundly and plainely planted, and the dutie of it rightly diſcharged, there he commandeth eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one to repent, and to become a new creature.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Matth. 17.11.</note>So the end of <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſts preaching was, <hi>to restore all things amiſſe,</hi> and to bring them to good order, Matth. 17.11.

               <p>And while they he thus farre out of the way, them ſelues, they are yet more bold to open their mouthes againſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligenter ſort, who knowing that Chriſt requireth it at their hands, that <hi>as they loue him, they ſhould feed his ſheepe and his lambes,</hi>

But theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remoued, and good preaching and liuing in ſtead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, interteined, and practiſed, ſuch a Miniſtery, as it is highly pleaſing to God, and commanded by him, ſo it giueth good hope of gathering a plentifull people vnto him.

               <p>Heere we muſt not make Chriſts words a ſtumbling blocke, as though he meant to ſet himſelfe againſt his owne word, which ſaith, that no reprobates (ſuch as Tyre and Sidon moſt diſſolute cities were) can be conuerted: but we muſt looke to his meaning, which was this: that as many heatheniſh cities of the Gentiles were conuerted by <hi>Pauls</hi> preaching Chriſt to them, as Theſſalonica, Philippos, Corinth with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other, were: ſo is it as likely, that theſe heere mentioned might haue done, (which if they had done, then ſhould they not haue bin reprobates,<note place="margin">Matth. 21.31.</note> for Chriſt ſpeaketh by ſuppoſition) euen as he ſaith to the like purpoſe in another place, <hi>Harlots and publicans ſhall enter into the kingdome of God before the</hi> chiefe Prieſts and the Elders of the people, which yet was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing likely in the ſight of men.</p>
               <p>So we reade that they who were mockers, and railed on the Apoſtles, (ſo farre were they from ſauouring their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly doctrine): yet when the Lord in his mercie towards them,<note place="margin">Act. 2.37.</note> cauſed them to attend to <hi>Peters</hi> ſermon reproouing

               <p>And that is, how maruellouſly God wrought among vs: that when there was no preſident nor example in the corner thereabout of diligent repairing to the place of Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip on the Sabbath in the afternoone; but all diſorder in dancing, playing, haunting the Ale-houſe, and other like, and little power of godlines to be ſeene or heard of round about; it pleaſed God by care and diligence in example giuing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, and labouring in that weake manner that I was able to teach and exhort them, with familiar conuerſing with them in priuate, who were more teachable then the reſt, in good communication drawing them on, that in two yeeres ſpace I might haue perſwaded them to any good thing that I ſaw meet: (the bodie of them I meane) and a louing conſent might haue bin ſeene among them to that which was good: neither can I ſay any worſe of them for the time that I could ſtay amongſt them, which was full ſix yeeres.</p>

               <p>This manner of liuing amongſt them, with an eſpeciall care to auoid iuſt ſuſpicion of couetouſneſſe, and loue of this world, and other offences, which are too common, is like, through Gods bleſſing to knit them ſo in firme and true loue together, that they ſhall call home to true repentance ſuch as God hath in thoſe places ordained to eternall life, and they ſhall by ſuch manner of liuing with them, be like with loue and readineſſe to receiue their doe at the peoples hands, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the paying and requiring of the which, the greateſt pritches are taken, and the ſoreſt conceits ariſe betwixt them, which are the beginnings and occaſions of continuall broiles and contentions afterwards, or at leaſt of ſtrangeneſſe, or hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and hauerly loue betwixt them, whereby it commeth to paſſe, that preaching doth little good vnto them.

This is that which he would haue vs learne out of theſe words. And to ſay the truth, if it were a meaner matter, then the meſſage and glad tidings of eternall life is, if it were but the offer of leaſe or fee ſimple of land in a good ayer and ſoile, who would not lay for the firſt offer, and labour by friends and coſt that none might haue the liberty of choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or refuſing before him? eſpecially if it were a good peny-worth. But alas, what is the greateſt Manour or Lordſhip, if it were a whole Country, which is yet but a corner of it, if it be compared with that ſpacious kingdome of heauen, already furniſhed withall manner of pleaſures and delights?

it commeth to paſſe; that they imbrace not the other at al (if many of them ſcorne them not) ſo farre is it off, that they be the firſt that receiue the glad tidings of the kingdome. If newes of any great importance or weight be brought into a lande, who are the firſt partakers of it but they? And good reaſon, for they are the chiefe and greateſt. If any dainties be, who aske for them ſooner then they, and why ſhould they not be for them before others, who are beſt able to buy them?</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The ſecond cauſe why men ſhould be deſirous to conuert truely to God at the firſt hearing of the Goſpell, is this: that though we might be ſure to doe it at the laſt, (whereas (yet) in all experience late repenting is dangerous) what wiſe man would be content to goe without the fruit of it in the meane ſeaſon? No, if it were but for one day, when he might inioy it.<note place="margin">Pſal. 84.11.</note> 
                  <hi>Seeing one day in the houſe of God, is better than a thouſand</hi> in any eſtate whatſoeuer out of a godly life. And thus it ſhuld be, ſeeing thus it might be with a man: that ſo he may inioy, euen all his life long, the moſt ſweet <hi>peace of God which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all vnderſtanding,</hi> (though not without tribulation in the fleſh) which no vnbeleeuer nor impenitent perſon can taſt of, his reioycing being onely momentany and deceitfull.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The third reaſon is this, that the ſooner we repent, the ſoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner we make ioyfull and glad al the true ſeruants of God, yea the very Angels,<note place="margin">Luk. 15.7.</note> whom our Sauiour affirmeth to reioyce thereat: and beſides, the ſooner we ſhall be fit to teach the waies of God to ſinners,<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.14.</note> and helpe to conuert the wicked vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, when we ſhal our ſelues be able to reioyce in our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, being made aſſured thereof by his holy ſpirit.

                  </note> as the Church complaineth, <hi>I am blacke (O ye daughters of Ieruſalem,)</hi> that is, disfigured with troubles; therefore the bad world ſhunneth and deſpiſeth her: For which ſhe anſwereth in the Prophet <hi>Micha. Reioyce not at me (O mine enemy: for though I am fallen, yet ſhall I riſe againe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Micah. 7.8.</note> 
                  <hi>and I will beare my puniſhment becauſe I haue ſinned.</hi> And yet when they, ſuch Deſpiſers I meane, and their like are afflicted, and the godly in proſperity, they thinke them the onely happy people.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they narrowly obſerue the ſlips and infirmities of Gods ſeruants, and make them odious, and are readie to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:16609:81"/>
take hurt by them, but the good courſe of their life they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard not, neither think that they need to follow them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Nay ſhall I ſay as the truth is? If the godly keepe a narrow watch ouer their waies, oh then they be too preciſe for them to keepe company with, they ſay: and on the otherſide, if they ſlip offenſiuely at any time, nay if they be but reported of to haue done ſo, be it true or falſe, they crie out in another manner thus; oh, theſe be your profeſſors, doe you not ſee what fruits they bring forth? So, they who are purpoſed to take no good by them, can alwayes lay ſtops in their owne way, and while they be at that point, it is no maruell though they ſet not much by repentance, which is that whereof Gods people haue their name that they be called repentant or godly.</p>
               <p>The third reaſon why ſuch haue the godly life in no better account and reckoning, is, for that they know little (nay they are farre off from it) what ioy and comfort it bringeth with it, neither the ſweete and holy peace which they who liue godly doe enioy. For <hi>Salomon</hi> truly ſetteth downe, that he that is a <hi>ſtranger</hi> from the life of Gods people,<note place="margin">Prou. 14.10. Reuelat. 14.3.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall not be partaker of their ioy.</hi> Neither, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, can any know, what that ſong meaneth, which maketh the godly merrie and ioyfull; but themſelues which are the Lords redeemed ones, which if they did know, they would (as our Sauiour ſaid to the woman of Samaria) firſt haue asked it of him,<note place="margin">Iohn 4.10.</note> as the thing that is moſt precious,<note place="margin">Hebr. 11.25.</note> and would haue preferred it before the pleaſures of ſinne, which (yet) laſt but for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. And this be ſaid of the ſecond point in the ſecond part, namely of repenting betimes.</p>
               <p>Now this repenting which Chriſt heere ſpeaketh of,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The laſt point in the ſecond part.</hi>
                  </note> what it is, (which is the laſt point in this ſecond part) this (I ſay) let vs examine a little, and ſo make an end. His words are theſe, <hi>they would haue repented in ſackcloth and aſhes.</hi> This muſt needs be (as we may well gather by his owne words) a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great importance. And that the repenting which men commonly ſo call, is nothing leſſe then that which he heere meaneth and ſpeaketh of. For the Lord Ieſus in ſaying, <hi>They would haue repented in ſackcloth and aſhes,</hi> meaneth, that they
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:16609:82"/>
would haue done it heartily and ſoundly; as theſe outward ceremonies did teſtifie ſuch a thing. And he ſpeaketh ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was well knowne to them, to whom he ſpake, that they who repented vnfainedly in times paſt, ſhewed it that way, though he did not thereby iuſtifie all to be truly peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, that vſed theſe ceremonies.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Repentance must be ſound, not hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</hi>
                  </note>Therefore according to his meaning, let vs learne this: that when we make account that we do repent, let vs ſee that it be true and heartie, not fained and hypocriticall. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we muſt ſee, that we be ſetled and ſtabliſhed, not flitting, nor off and on, as the manner of the moſt is, to offer to God ſuch cracked halfe ſeruice. Now as by repentance heere, he meaneth the whole conuerſion of a man, which conſiſteth in the pricke of conſcience, faith in Gods promiſes, and care of amendment of life; ſo muſt mens repentings be, and not be patched and pieced with ſhreds and rags of our owne deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, but currant and approued, hauing all theſe three parts in it. For elſe as a ragge it will ſoone weare away, whereas it is to be preſerued, vpholden and continued, and the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger we liue, to be better teſtified that it is true and vnfained indeed.</p>
               <p>And thus do and proſper: ſuch a foundation laid, ſhall be fit to be builded vpon proportionablie, and when wee haue thus begun, in the ſame manner go we forward, till we and all other that liſt, may ſee, that our repentance is that which is not to be repented of. And for want of this, as they who did neuer rightly begin, ſhall haue nothing whereof they may reioyce, whatſoeuer their ſhewes be: ſo they who haue begun well; yet without ſuch a proceeding, ſhall euer be readie to ſtagger, and to doubt whether they did euer right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly begin to beleeue and repent or no, which, who doth not ſee, what a continuall diſquietnes and diſcomfort it breeds? whereas they who are ſetled and commendablie go forward, ſhall hold the confidence and reioycing of their hope vnto the end. And this of the whole.</p>

                     <hi>The opening of the text.</hi>
                  </note> that part of their life which is paſſed in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace and proſperity, (which bleſſing of God the moſt part doe greatly abuſe;) I thought it both verie pertinent, and alſo profitable, to ſhew and ſet downe ſome examples of ſuch as haue done ſo; and examples not of one man, two or three, but of whole particular Churches, who may be paternes of well vſing outward peace, and reſt from perſecution, and trouble to the worlds end. Here ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in this text I meane, (to lay out the meaning thereof,) you may ſee people of no long continuance (for the moſt of them) in the profeſſion of the Goſpell, who as they had been hardly holden vnder of trouble and perſecution, in all the three places of Iudea, Samaria and Galily, and yet reuolted not from their religion, neither fainted in their hope; ſo now, when God gaue them a breathing time (as it were) of outward peace and reſt from their former perſecution, they neglected not the occaſion offered them, but tooke the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:16609:83"/>
to benefit themſelues in the practiſe of godlineſſe, to their high commendation, and to the example of all poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie that ſhould come after them. For they vſed all good meanes both in communion and meeting together publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and priuately, by hearing the Apoſtles doctrine, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the ſame, and euery one by himſelfe in reading and prayer, to ſet themſelues forward therein.</p>
               <p>And by theſe and ſuch like meanes they builded vp them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues in ſauing and effectuall knowledge, in faith, hope, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, loue, and other graces of God, and reſted not there, but alſo ſhewed the ſame forth in their liues before men, with great ioy of heart to themſelues. Neither was this their holy and heauenly courſe without fruit, for the Lord bleſſed it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly to the praiſe of his name in the conuerſion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. For ſo it is ſaid in the text, that they <hi>were multiplied,</hi> that is, the number of them who were beleeuers in Chriſt, was encreaſed; the Lord adding vnto them, that is, to the Church, through the good example which they gaue; many, euen of the bad ſort, which liued among them. And ſo the word <hi>(multiplied)</hi> is to be vnderſtood, as in the originall tongue moſt clearely may appeare; and not as it is taken in ſome tranſlations, that is to ſay, that <hi>they were multiplied by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the holy Ghost:</hi> for that altereth the ſenſe of the place, which is this, as I haue ſaid; that the faithfull were multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, encreaſed in number; other who had been vnbeleeuers before, being brought to the faith; and not as the tranſlaters take it, that the comfort of the faithfull was multiplied. Thus much be ſaid for the coherence of this text with the former, and for the laying out of the meaning of it.</p>

                     <hi>The parts of it, two.</hi>
                  </note>Now follow the parts of it, and they are generally two. The one is the ſetting downe of the ſtate of theſe Churches, of Iudea, Samaria and Galilie at that time, namely, that they were not vnder perſecution, as a while before they had been; but they had reſt from it. The other part is the vſe that was made of it amongſt them. The vſe of this peace or reſt from perſecution, was made by two ſorts of people· the one was the faithfull and beleeuers: the other, thoſe which beleeued not. The vſe that the faithfull made of it, was threefold; the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:16609:83"/>
one, that they for their owne parts grew in grace and in the gifts of God. For it is ſaid, they were edified, that is, builded vp: if ye aske wherein? the anſwere is, in faith and the fruits of it; as <hi>Iude</hi> in his Epiſtle wrote to the Churches,<note place="margin">Iude 19.</note> 
                  <hi>that they ſhould be builded vp in their moſt holy faith.</hi> The ſecond vſe they made of their peace, was, that they did ſhew foorth the ſame grace and faith in their liues before men: for ſo it is ſaid, <hi>they walked</hi> (through the courſe of their liues) <hi>in the feare of the Lord.</hi> The third was, they did by both prouide and procure to themſelues a ſweete and a ſound comfort in their liues, (which few heere enioy:) for ſo it is ſaid, <hi>they were comforted by the holy Ghost.</hi> The vſe the bad ſort and vnbeleeuers made of it, was this, that they learned by the examples of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to embrace the Goſpell, and to be good in that time of reſt from perſecution, and became followers of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; for they would not haue been multiplied, if the other had not been added to them.</p>
               <p>But to begin; before I ſpeake of outward peace and reſt from perſecution, firſt let it be marked,<note place="margin">

                  </note> that thoſe Churches were before this, vnder perſecution: to teach vs, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though God loue his people dearely, and can afford them his good benefits of all ſorts in this life, as he beſtowed the beſt vpon theſe; yet he ſeeth it good, to exerciſe them with ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie afflictions, as he ſaith, <hi>whom I loue, I correct.</hi>

               <p>And for theſe cauſes, and for that they are layed on vs by him who doth all things well, and for the good of his; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt both ſtoope to them willingly, and looke vp to him who hath ſmitten vs, that he may heale vs.<note place="margin">Rom. 8.2<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>The ſecond part. What vſe the godly made of their peace.</hi> 1. <hi>They were edified.</hi>
                  </note>To begin with them therefore, it is ſaid firſt, that they did edifie and build vp themſelues. In what? It muſt needes be, that the holy Ghoſt meant in ſuch inward grace, as inabled them to ſhew it foorth outwardly in their liues before men, as the feare of God, knowledge, faith, hope, care to pleaſe God, and ſuch like; in which, it is ſaid after, they walked amongſt men. And therefore outward duties cannot bee meant thereby, ſeeing the performing of them was another vſe of their peace, ſpoken of afterward ſeuerally by it ſelfe. And how did they build vp themſelues thus in grace? It was by vſing all holy meanes for that purpoſe, both publike and priuate, as the hearing of the Apoſtles doctrine, praying, and vſing other godly fellowſhip together. So that this is as much as if it were ſaid, that they vſed all diligence, and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themſelues now while God gaue them this little brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from perſecution; that ſo by their confidence, pure heart, good conſcience, loue, and patience, and other grace, they might be fit to leade a godly life in the world with eaſe, and ſtrengthen themſelues againſt falles, and the baits of ſin on euery ſide. And it is manifeſt to all of vs who can iudge, that by ſuch meanes, and a ſound miniſterie, watching, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the like; the Church of God can grow in grace, and no otherwiſe. And that they did thus it is apparent, by that which we reade in the ſecond of the Acts,<note place="margin">Acts 2 43.</note> where it is ſaid, <hi>that they were daily in the temple, and continued in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles doctrine, and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and prayer.</hi>

               <p>And this vſe ſhould all true particular Churches and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God make of their libertie of peace, and of liuing free from perſecution. From the which God hath a long time

freed many of his good ſeruants in this age, howſoeuer ſome are much and oft vnder the croſſe, yea and that right heauie and ſharpe; ſuch therefore ſhould glorifie God by bringing forth fruit, not in a common ſort, yea al poſſible good ſhould be done of them, and not omitted. For as for priuate lets, and thoſe which are vſuall; may more eaſily be ouercome (either inward corruptions, or outward ill examples, or other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements) as long as the word of God may haue free paſſage to be ſincerely preached.</p>

prouiſion, and good allowance, entring vpon liuings, which they neuer toiled themſelues, nor paied for, (I ſpeake of ſuch, for elſe their ſinne is double) when (I ſay) they haue bin thus bountifully prouided for, they haue not made their ſtudie and care of preaching for the peoples ſaluation, their geateſt delight, (which yet if I know any thing, or if they taught well in their Colledges) ſhould haue been: the Apoſtle teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch,<note place="margin">1.

For euen the moſt of them, who haue the Goſpell preached among them both purely and painfully, what heartie loue haue they to it? what power hath it ouer their affections? how few are caſt into the mould of it, to be made humble, lowly, vpright, innocent,

zealous, mercifull, kind; and on the contrarie to caſt vp the vnſauourie gorge of their rebellious corruptions?</p>
               <p>Oh how few of them haue plied the meanes with ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence and diligence, that they may teſtifie that they haue growne in knowledge, faith and other grace, but haue rather employed themſelues wholly about the flitting &amp; vaniſhing profits and pleaſures of this preſent life, as though they had not been borne to farre more excellent ends and purpoſes?

               <p>And this is the ſecond vſe that theſe Churches made of their peace, and reſt from perſecution, which is commended by the holy Ghoſt to all true Chriſtians to follow them in, and to teach them, that when God enlargeth their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and multiplieth his bleſſings vpon them, they ſhould not, as the men of the world doe, eate and drinke, and ſleep, and play, as though they ſhould neuer be called to their account for the miſpending of their time, and the ill vſing of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits: but rather they ſhould know, firſt that all Gods good bleſſings are talents committed to them of their heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore that they ſhould occupy them carefully and faithfully, till he come to demand how they haue vſed them, and what good they haue done with them. And ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that they ſhould conſider, that it is the very end why God hath freed them from many great calamities, and ſet them at more liberty then ſundry others of their brethren, to the end that they may thus honour him with a godly and a fruitefull life, which they that want them, can hardly doe. So that although he is not a Chriſtian, who is onely one in outward ſhew, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of the Iew:<note place="margin">Rom. 2.28.</note> yet whatſoeuer inward grace men haue, it muſt be teſtified by forſaking all ſinne outward, and by a godly life, both in their word and deed.</p>

Therefore to follow the firſt tranſlation, the third vſe that they made of their peace is ſet downe, namely that they paſſed their dayes, and walked through them comfortably, and in ioy and gladnes of heart. And in theſe words note two things. The one is the vſe they made of their peace, namely that they liued comfortably. The other; how or by what meanes they did ſo: for we know that all ſuch as liue in peace, and haue reſt from perſecution, do not for all that, liue comfortably.<note place="margin">

                  </note> who profeſſe the feare of God, are taught to make this vſe of our freedome from great affliction and trouble; to liue ioyfully, and to delight our ſelues in the Lord, and in his al ſufficiency. Which thing one would thinke, is more then God would affoord vs. For there is no greater bleſſing inioyed in our life, then to reioyce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and to liue comfortably, we ſee how greedily al earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, delight and pleaſure is laied for, and imbraced: and yet it is all but a ſhadow of this that I ſpeake of, euen as this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and heauenly ioy is but a glimpſe and taſte of that which is eternall.

                  </note> For the holy Ghoſt teaching that the Churches encreaſed and were multiplied, ſheweth that it was by this that they were added vnto them, and brought into the way of ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,

who were before farre from it.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>They were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted to God, and ioyned to his people.</hi>
                  </note> As if he ſhould ſay, euen the bad, while the Churches had reſt, were mooued and drawne by the examples of the godly, to follow them and to do as they did: that is to ſay, they heard the word of God, and they ioyned themſelues in fellowſhip with them, and the Lord wrought thereby in ſuch wiſe, that they diſclaimed their former euill courſe, and were conuerted vnto him.</p>
               <p>This is a moſt famous and notable example, to teach euen the bad how they ſhould behaue themſelues in the dayes of peace, and what vſe God looketh, that euen they ſhould make of it. They haue not libertie to liue as they liſt, nor to trifle out their precious time as though neither any good were to be done in it, and as though they ſhould giue no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how they haue paſſed it. But that they ſhould look vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them whom God hath ſet as examples among them, to be moued thereby, to be out of loue with their owne courſe, and to like the good which they ſee in them, and long to haue their part in it.</p>
               <p>For to this end, doth the Lord raiſe vp many good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in ſundrie places, and giues them ofttimes peace, to the end that when they haue both theſe, with the pure preaching of the Goſpell, they may haue nothing to complaine of, why they ſhould not embrace the Chriſtian courſe, as others do. And therefore the eſtate of all ſuch is dangerous in no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort, who neuer aske wherefore all theſe good examples ſerue, but rather ſcorne and diſlike them, or at leaſt haue no fellowſhip with them.</p>

For why did God giue <hi>Ahab</hi> great victories ouer his enemie <hi>Benhadad,</hi> but to the end hee ſhould know the Lord to be God, and acknowledge him, beleeue in him, loue and feare him? And did God prouoke him, an Idolater and wicked man, to forſake his euill way, and will he reiect other who would draw nigh to him if they durſt? No, God is readie to receiue, yea he ſeeketh ſuch as flie from him, and which wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

               <p>And ſeeing I haue gone ſo farre in this matter,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>How they ſhould do it.</hi>
                  </note> I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a little further, and put on the perſon of ſuch as are yet in darkneſſe, and would willingly ſee light. Such (I know) would aske, how they may come home, and be receiued in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fauour of God. To ſuch I anſwere: they muſt be moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by the reports of them who are in Chriſt alreadie, and be perſwaded, what beautie is in the Goſpell, how precious it is, and how many, who haue been farre off, haue by the power and perſwaſion of it, come home to true repentance, as the Publicans and great ſinners, who heard our Sauiour preach to them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, they muſt heare the word of God diligently, as <hi>Salomon</hi> willeth; that they who will be bleſſed,<note place="margin">Prou. 8.33.</note> ſhould <hi>watch daily at wiſdomes gates, and giue attendance at the postes of her doores</hi>; yea and further, they muſt with the good people of Berea, <hi>receiue the word with all readineſſe.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 17.11.</note> They muſt alſo draw to good companie,<note place="margin">Act. 9.27.</note> as <hi>Paul</hi> cleaued to <hi>Barnabas</hi> at his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion; and the people, both Iewes and Gentiles, who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the Goſpell, did, whereſoeuer he preached. And by theſe meanes God worketh ſo in thoſe whom he will ſaue, that he changeth their hearts and maketh them new perſons.</p>
               <p>For though many people haue ſundrie kinds of lets to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them from beleeuing, yet they to whom God hath a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, he will draw them by ſome excellent thing that they heare, or by means of ſome doubt that troubleth them, of the which they deſire to be reſolued; that they ſhall not breake off their hearing, till they receiue that chiefe and moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent light by preaching, which bringeth contentment, and reſolution of that which did moſt trouble them, and that is, faith vnfained. And this is that which ought moſt of al to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupy and take vp the minds of vnſtaied perſons, who haue no ſure hold of eternall life: and this is the vſe which they ought to make of their liuing in peace, and beholding the good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of thoſe who are better then themſelues: to waite in
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:16609:93"/>
their hearings, and long for this, namely, that they may know they ſhal be ſaued. As for al other taking vp of their thoughts and deſires, the beſt of them are but deceiuable, that I ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of further miſchiefes which they bring vpon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.</p>
               <p>But doe the common ſort of the ignorant and prophane make this vſe of their peaceable liuing among Gods ſeruants? Indeed, God be praiſed, ſome do, for how ſhould the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of penitent perſons otherwiſe grow greater daily? But for the moſt part euen where the Goſpel is purely preached, they looke after no ſuch thing, but as though they knew not to what end God hath ſet godly Chriſtians among them, they giue them leaue, euen they who are of the forwarder ſort of them, to walke alone, rather then to conuerſe and haue fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with them; but ſome thinke, other ſpeake euill of them; and (which is worſt of all) becauſe they are ſuch: which ſort of people for the moſt part grow hardened, and waxe worſe and worſe: ſo farre it is off, that they take good by them. And this be ſaid of this latter ſort who liued among the godly, what vſe they made thereof.</p>

               <p>I will not ſtand by further reaſons, which are many, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the proofe of this point, that the righteous as they haue need to be ſtirred vp to ioy, ſo they haue iuſt cauſe, (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that may ſeeme to make to the contrarie) to be merrie and glad in heart.

               <p>Secondly, they want that imputation of Chriſts righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe to couer their ſhame before God: ſo that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not aſſure themſelues, that they haue any part or portion in the glorie of the ſonnes of God, that is to be reuealed.

I ceaſe to ſpeake of thoſe helliſh terrors of an accuſing conſcience, that cannot but expell all ioy and comfort foorth, ſo oft as their ſleepie conſcience is awakened, and omit many other things, which might be added to this purpoſe.

Further obſerue, whom hee heere exhorteth thus often to reioyce in the Lord, and that is, the faithfull, that alreadie had this ioy begun in their hearts.

Deſpiſe therefore this ioy, and ſcorne it, as many doe, who count it but a fantaſie, and withall, thou refuſeſt the ioyes of heauen, whereof this ioy is but the beginning. On the contrary, procure, keepe and encreaſe this ioy, and theſe are a certaine and ſure pledge vnto thee, of the ioyes of the life to come. And the more thou canſt fill and fraught thy ſelfe with this ioy, the nearer doeſt thou come vnto the life of the Saints in heauen. For this ioy here on earth, and that in heauen, is not differing in kinde. But the ioy of the faithfull militant, is the ſame with that of the faithful triumphant. The ſame, I ſay, for the nature and kinde of the ioy, though not for the degree and perfection of it. So that as I ſaid, the more we grow on in this ioy, the nearer we come to the bleſſed life of the Saints triumphant.</p>

                  </note>Now then that we may know how this reconciliation is to be made with God, without the which we cannot ioy in him; we are in it to proceed by theſe three degrees. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, we are to come to the knowledge of our ſin by the Law of God: we are to bring the Law, rightly taught and vnderſtood of vs, as a light into our hearts: to ſee what heapes of filthie ſins lie in euery darke corner of our hearts: to ſee what are the duties required in euery ſeuerall precept; and how we haue omitted them: what ſinnes are condemned in euery precept: and how and in what degree we haue ſinned in the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of them. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, we are to weigh the iudiciall ſentence of the Law againſt vs. <hi>Curſed is euery one that continueth not in all things written in the Law, to do them.</hi> And then not to bleſſe our ſelues, that yet all ſhall be well, nor to make a league and couenant with hell and death, which ſhall not be kept: but in token we beleeue, our hearts muſt be filled with ſorrow, and all our vaine reioycings are to bee turned to mourning, till we melt and relent, be abaſed and humbled thereby, and brought to an vtter deſpaire of all helpe in our ſelues. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, being thus truly caſt downe in our owne ſoules, we are then to learne to know, what meanes God hath appoined, to free vs from the bitter curſe of death and hell. The meanes he appointed for the freeing vs (were) the death, paſſion and y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> obedience of Chriſt Ieſus: that he might vndergo the curſe and wrath of God for ſuch loſt and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorne ones, as we are: and that we might be freed from it, and ſo make a full and perfect ſatisfaction for vs: and fulfill the Law, that his obedience might be imputed vnto vs. But yet this paſſion and obedience of Chriſt are not ours, except they be applied to vs by faith in the promiſes of the Goſpell. Theſe promiſes therefore are to be knowne, and then by faith to be laid hold on: the promiſes tending to this purpoſe, are euery where very comfortable and plentifull in Scripture, Ioh.<note place="margin">Iohn 3.14.</note> 3.14. <hi>As the Serpent was lift vp in the wilderneſſe; ſo must the Sonne of man be lift vp: that whoſoeuer beleeueth, ſhould not periſh, but haue eternall life. For God ſo loued the world, that he
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:16609:106"/>
ſent his onely begotten Sonne, that whoſoeuer beleeueth in him, ſhould not periſh, but haue eternall life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which being ſo, how can it be that we being freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſting, affrighting and thundring threatnings of the Law, and tranſlated by this faith into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> glorious liberty of the ſons and daughters of God, but that wee ſhould bee exceedingly ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhed in ioy at this ſo vnſpeakable loue and mercie of God vnto vs? If onely we were freed from the curſe of the Law, which is eternall death and torment, and had only this ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of God turned from vs, that he ſhould no more hate vs, this were cauſe enough, one would thinke, if we did duely conſider it, of great reioycing. But truly to beleeue that God ſhould further loue vs, and loue vs, as it were, aboue his owne Sonne, that he ſhould wound him to ſpare vs, and curſe him to bleſſe vs; that he ſhould kill him to quicken vs, that he ſhould abandon and forſake him, that he might againe take and receiue vs; this I ſay, to beleeue, it cannot but cheare and reioyce the ſaddeſt heart, and heauieſt ſoule that euer was. It is ſaid in the Acts,<note place="margin">Act. 2.42.</note> 
                  <hi>All that beleeued continued in the Apostles doctrine, and ate their meat with gladnes and ſinglenes of heart.</hi> This faith made them all, though they were in a moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous eſtate, in regard of the world, and the enemies they had in it, to reioyce and be merrie in the Lord; notwithſtanding all the ſnares and dangers, that infeſted them on euerie ſide. And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> writing to all the diſperſed beleeuers of the Iewes in many countries, in his 1. Epiſtle, 1.8. ſaith, <hi>Ye beleeuing in him,</hi> that is in Chriſt, <hi>though you ſee him not, you reioyce with ioy vnspeakable and glorious.</hi> Though Chriſt were abſent in bodie, yet this faith of theirs in him, made them all to reioyce, with vnſpeakable and glorious ioy, as the people of Samaria did after they beleeued in Chriſt. Thus then we ſee briefely what is the only way to attaine, and come vnto this ioy heere in this exhortation of the Apoſtle commended vnto vs. But I haue both in a direction, and in Sermons hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led this at large, and will ſay no more of it.</p>

                  </note> how we may both keepe and encreaſe this ioy in our hearts. And this is to be done by many meanes. The firſt and the moſt principall is, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:16609:107"/>
heedfull and attentiue hearing of the word of God. For that, as it hath bin the principall meane of God to beget faith, and to breed and begin this ioy in thine heart: ſo is it the chiefe and ſoueraigne meane, whereby God will both continue and encreaſe this ioy in thee: for he hath giuen this charge to his ſeruants; whom he truſteth with his word, to reueale and to diſcouer daily in the preaching of the Word, more plainely vnto vs the riches of his grace in the Goſpell. Now it cannot be but the more cleere fight we come to haue of the mercie of God in Chriſt, the more our hearts muſt needs take ioy and pleaſure in it. Secondly, by the preaching of the Word, we haue not only the eye of our vnderſtanding cleared, and the miſts and vailes of our ignorance remedied, but our affections are alſo whetted on to a greater delight and ioy in the goodneſſe of God alreadie knowne vnto vs. Our memories alſo are continually renued and refreſhed, when we heare the ſame or the like doctrine, promiſes and exhortations iterated and repeated vnto vs. Would we ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euer haue our ioy to continue freſh and flouriſhing, then let vs neuer be wearie of hearing the word of God taught and preached vnto vs: this was the ſeed of our ioy, and this is that which feedeth it, cauſeth it to continue, grow and flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, and without which, it cannot but wither, decay, and die in vs.</p>

God vnto vs. But the word of God is more fitly, as I take it, in the Scripture called the will and teſtament of God. For herein the Lord hath ſet downe what inheritances, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathes and legacies, he hath willed and bequeathed vnto vs. Can we reade theſe continually, carefully and attentiuely, and not be moued to ioy? No, it is impoſſible. For it is not in this Teſtament of God, as it is commonly in the wils of men. There, though there be many and great things bequeathed; yet in a few readings ouer, a man may come to ſound the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of them. But the will of God containeth an endleſſe and bottomleſſe ſea of riches, that a man can neuer ſound the depth, nor reach the bottome of it.<label type="milestone">

Seek therefore the continuance and increaſe of this ioy at Gods hand, and thou ſhalt finde it, knock for it by prayer, at the doore of Gods mercy, and he will giue it vnto thee. But alas, this duty of prayer for ioy is careleſly, for the moſt part, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.

If they that haue continued a long time in Chriſts ſchoole, ſhould trie, and examine how ſmall proceedings they haue made in this Chriſtian duty, and ſearch to finde out the cauſe of their ſo little profiting, they ſhall finde by triall, one maine cauſe to haue bin, the neglect of prayer for ſo excellent a grace as this is.</p>

                  </note>Next vnto prayer, the Apoſtle, in the place before named, addeth <hi>thankſgiuing</hi>: For though we craue and beg neuer ſo much, this ioy at Gods hands; yet if he ſend vs ioy according to our deſire; and we be not mindfull to returne thankes vnto him, he will withhold and withdraw his hand from giuing it to vs. God indeed hath bound himſelfe to giue grace, and to giue ioy vnto them that aske it; but yet ſo, that they be thankefull after: without which thankefulneſſe for bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits receiued, they, that come to God, plainely declare that they pray not as they ought. For when we pray for ioy, or pray for any grace, wee are not ſimplie to reſt in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it ſelfe: but our deſire muſt aime at a further ende; and that is, that we receiuing theſe, may praiſe and bleſſe God for them. Marke the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> in the ſixth Pſalme, in the thirtieth Pſalme, and in diuers others: he deſireth that the Lord would giue him life: but he asketh not life ſimply, that he might liue; but <hi>becauſe the dead cannot praiſe God,</hi> here as the liuing doe. And therefore deſireth life, that liuing he might praiſe God: After the ſame manner, is framed alſo the prayer of <hi>Hezechiah</hi> Eſay. 38. So therefore we are to pray for life, that liuing we may praiſe God: and pray for ioy, that reioycing we may praiſe him. we are not to aske life ſimply to liue, but that liuing we may praiſe God, neither are we to aske ioy ſimply for it ſelfe; but, that reioycing in God and in his goodnes, we might haue cauſe, and be the fitter to bleſſe God for it. And thus if we come to God for ſupply of new ioy with thanks, for the former obtained, God is ready, and willing to heare vs, But ſeeing I cannot goe through all the meanes of preſeruing our ioy, at this time, I will here ſtay for this time.</p>

For when theſe good moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, cauſed in vs by the ſpirit, are cheriſhed; the ſpirit of God is cheriſhed: and being cheared ſo, he cheareth and filleth our hearts with ioy, and <hi>annointeth vs with the oyle of gladnes.</hi> On the contrary: quench theſe good motions, and thou quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt the ſpirit of God, which ſhould cauſe this ioy in thine heart. Therefore, commeth there at any time, any good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions into thine heart? be carefull, by all meanes poſſible, to entertaine them, to cheriſh and to make much of them. So ſhalt thou make glad the good ſpirit of God, and hee ſhall giue peace, and ioy to thy ſoule. But is this commonly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed? Nothing leſſe.

For which of vs can excuſe our ſelues, but that we haue had diuers good motions, ſometimes from others, ſometimes from our ſelues; and yet we haue reſiſted them. Sometimes we haue bin mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to heare the word of God; yet either for ſome vaine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or ſmall profit, we haue neglected it.

And this experience teacheth vs, that the ſetting

For there is a far greater oddes &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trariety betweene earthly pleaſures and heauenly ioyes, then is betweene one earthly pleaſure and another. The rule therefore is, that we vſe a temperancie and a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the lawfull pleaſures of this life, and ſo reioyce, as the Apoſtle teacheth vs, 1.

                  </note>Hence then we ſee, it is very dangerous in regard of the loſſe of our ioy, to omit for a time, and to make intermiſſion of good duties: as alſo to giue leaue for a time to our ſelues, to the practiſe of ought that hath been, and is like to be a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to the progreſſe and proceeding of our Chriſtian ioy. For omit a good dutie this day, and thinke it is not long to the next, it ſhall be done as well then; thou ſhalt find leſſe diſpoſition in thy ſelfe vnto it; and leſſe delight in the doing of it, by that intermiſſion of thine. And againe, giue thy ſelfe libertie, but at one time, to practiſe that thou ſhouldeſt not, and thinke thou wilt not be ſo farre carried with thy delight another time; that one action of thine ſhall make thy delight ſtronger,<label type="milestone">

               <p>Againe, becauſe they intermit it ſtill, and deferre, from this day to the next, the practiſe of it.

Let him therefore ſue vnto thee, but for one Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath in the yeare, to be kept vnto him in wantonneſſe, &amp; va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and let him labour to further it what he can, and pleade old, and ancient cuſtome for it: yet if (I ſay) thou feaſt him, and makeſt him merry but one day in the yeare, hee will ſo winde in himſelfe, and grow in one day into ſo familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with thee, that thou ſhalt not be able to winde thy ſelfe out of it, when thou wouldeſt.</p>
               <p>The laſt meanes which I will note, whereby we may both keepe, and encreaſe our ioy, is, that whenſoeuer the Lord ſhal call vs out to troubles and croſſes,<note place="margin">

                  </note> that we ſubmit our ſelues willingly and patiently to goe thorough them. For this is a certaine and a ſure poſition alwaies in Gods children, that ſorrowes and troubles ſent vnto them of God, are a direct way whereby the Lord intendeth to bring them vnto grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ioy; and the greater, and more continued troubles the Lord bringeth vpon them, to the greater ioy doth he carry them, if they willingly, and patiently paſſe through them. Reade, 2.

And this is ſutable, and well agreeing to all the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God, for the moſt part. For when hee meaneth to exalt thee higheſt, then he firſt humbleth thee by afflictions, and caſteth thee downe loweſt.

The Iſraelites God led them into a land flowing with milke and hony; but he led them through barren, and a terrible, and feareful wildernes. <hi>Ioſeph</hi> was exalted to be next the King in Egypt, but he was carried thorough pits, and priſons and bondage, vnto it.</p>

                  <pb n="222" facs="tcp:16609:113"/>On the contrary, marke the dealing of God with the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked: he ſpareth them here, becauſe he meanes to puniſh them in hell.

Doth God there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore call thee to trouble, this is the way he hath prepared to bring thee to ioy, if thou wilt follow it. Reade an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent place to this purpoſe. Acts 20.22. <hi>And now behold,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the elders of Epheſus, <hi>I goe bound in the ſpirit to Ieruſalem, not knowing what ſhall befall me there, ſaue that the holy Ghoſt in euery city witneſſeth, that bonds and afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons abide for mee.</hi> Marke now his reſolution, <hi>but I paſſe not at all,</hi> (ſaieth he) <hi>neither is my life deare vnto my ſelfe, that I may fulfill my courſe with ioy.</hi> He ſaw many dangers, and many troubles before him: but yet he would not auoide them, for in ſo doing he ſhould haue bereaued himſelfe of former ioy, and depriued himſelf of much comfort, that by theſe he aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe of.

For theſe men therefore, it is a good courſe to reſtore either vnto the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, if he be a man of knowledge and learning in the word of God, and of conſcience and fidelity, accordingly: or els to ſome other of truſt and experience in the word of God; And reueale, and diſcouer vnto them, what it is that maketh them either, troubled in minde, or dead and blockiſh, for want of ſpirituall ioy and comfortt. For not only we are like to haue the help, and benefit of their counſell, for our parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular caſe; but euen the very diſcouery of the cauſe of this our deadnes, and helpe how to remedie it, is a meanes often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to begin againe the ſenſe and feeling of our ioy.</p>
               <p>To theſe meanes, if they alone will not ſerue, it were good to adde faſting and prayer.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The third meane.</hi>
                  </note> For theſe are of that power, that they are able, being rightly vſed, to caſt out the deuill him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, out of thoſe, in whom he hath taken corporall poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. As our Sauiour teacheth. Mat. 17.21. And much more no doubt, will it be able to expell that heauineſſe and deadnes of ſpirit, that poſſeſſeth vs. And to raiſe vs vp againe to the ſenſe of our former ioy, But here it will be good, eſpecially to haue regard of that which I ſpake of before, to obſerue moſt dilligently euery good motion of the ſpirit of God; and to giue them the beſt, and the kindeſt entertainment we can. For as we commonly leeſe our ioy, by reſiſting the good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſpirit of ioy and comfort; ſo by a harty and kinde entertaining of them, one time or other thy ioy is likeſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto thee againe.</p>
               <p>But to draw to a concluſion of all, we haue ſeene how ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt the Lord is by the Apoſtle, to call and exhort vs to this
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:16609:114"/>
duty of reioycing in the Lord: we haue alſo ſeene, by what meanes we may attaine to this ioy, if we yet haue it not, and how many and ſpeciall meanes God hath giuen vs, to keepe and to encreaſe it when we haue it, and to recouer it, if we haue loſt the ſenſe and feeling of it. What then is our duty, but that we try and examine our owne hearts, to finde whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther euer we felt in our hearts any true reioycing in God, and in good things, and if we neuer knew, what it meant, let vs learne, (in that ſort that I haue ſhewed) to get it: and ſo after; to keepe it.</p>
               <p>And eſpecially by weaning our ſelues, for the loue of this ioy, from other delights, pleaſures, and profits, wherein we haue bin taken vp: and willingly vndergoing troubles, and croſſes, (when God hath called vs vnto them,) for the ſame, and ſo to keepe it.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>If our ioy be loſt, neuer reſt til we finde it againe.</hi>
                  </note> And if we haue by careleſſe negligence ſuffered the deuill, to bereaue vs of this ſo rich and pretious a iewell of our ioy; yet let vs by al meanes poſſible, labour vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly, day and night, to renew and recouer that we haue loſt: and let vs neuer giue any reſt vnto God, nor vnto our owne hearts, vntil we feele the heauenly ſparkles of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ioy againe kindled in vs. And when it hath pleaſed God, againe to reſtore it to vs, let vs beware greatly of a ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe. It is very eaſie without dilligent care taking to be loſt,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Let none take thy crowne from thee.</hi>
                  </note> and many enemies lie in waite, to take it from vs. But it is not ſo eaſie to be found againe, when it is loſt. The thiefe is not ſo chary to keepe thy gold from thee, when he hath ſtolne it, as the deuil is to keep away, and to hide thy ioy from thee, that thou mighteſt neuer finde it againe.</p>
               <p>Now though I haue already vſed ſome reaſons to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade vs to be carefull of this duty, yet conſidering our dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and vntowardnes vnto it;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Motiues to ioy in God.</hi>
                  </note> it ſhall not be vnfit to adde for a finall concluſion, a few motiues to make vs the better to remember, and to put in practiſe theſe meanes, whereof you haue now heard. And to omit to ſpeake of that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I touched, that al other ioy, beſides this, vaniſheth away, and nothing in the end remaineth, but ſorrow and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Spirit. As <hi>Salomon</hi> hath left his owne experience to teach vs. And that this ioy is of it ſelfe, the moſt compleate,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:16609:115"/>
and abſolute ioy that can be poſſeſſed,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> as being founded in God himſelfe; conſider beſides it ſelfe, what excellent priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges this ioy bringeth vnto vs: It bringeth vnto vs comfort aboundantly, againſt all the croſſes that can befall vs, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the enemies we can haue in this life; Let famine, Let nakedneſſe, Let danger aſſaile vs; we haue God yet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce in, to feed vs, to cloath vs, to protect vs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo far as ſhall be for our good. Let wicked men baniſh vs, Let them hate vs, let them impriſon vs, let them take our liues from vs, yet we haue God to reioyce in; who will accompany vs in baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in priſon, or in what place ſoeuer; whoſe loue ſhal more then counteruaile all the hatred of the wicked. And the life that he hath hid and treaſured vp for vs, ſhall be better, then a thouſand liues which they can take away.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> This ioy is as ſalt, to ſeaſon and to ſauour al our other ioyes whatſoeuer they be: for without this, our pleaſures are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſauourie, and haue no taſte nor ſauour of pleaſure in them. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, laſtly, marke what an excellent promiſe the Lord ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth to this ioy, Pſal. 37.4. <hi>Delight thy ſelfe</hi> (ſaith the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt) <hi>in the Lord, and he ſhall giue thee thine hearts deſire.</hi> There is no man but would bee glad to haue his deſire ſatisfied. Loe then the way: <hi>Delight thy ſelfe in God,</hi> be carefull to keepe this bleſſed ioy; and God, who cannot lie, hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to giue thee whatſoeuer thy heart can deſire: ſo ready is the Lord to fulfill the deſire of them, that reioyce and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light themſelues in him. It was a great fauour of the Lord vnto <hi>Salomon,</hi> 1. King. 3. to aske him what he ſhould giue him, and he would be readie to giue it; yet God made him promiſe but for one requeſt: what a fauour of God is this then vnto thee, that there ſhall be no good thing thy tongue can aske,<note place="margin">Pſal. 84.13.14.</note> or thy heart deſire, but the Lord will giue it to thee, ſo be it, thou delight thy ſelfe in him? But conſider, for thy further care yet of this dutie, that this promiſe implieth alſo a threatning in it. And that is, if thou refuſeſt to delight in God, and wilt take thy pleaſure and delight in vanitie, in ſin, in the breach of the Sabbath, and of other duties; God will deny thee euery deſire of thy heart. In that which thou deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ioy in, God will ſend thee ſorrow: in that thou deſireſt a

                  </note> is a plaine and euident token of an hypocrite, whom God hateth, For read Iob. 27.10. <hi>The hypocrite,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iob) will he ſet his delight in the almightie? will he call vpon God at all times?</hi> making both theſe alike to be notes and brandes of a diſſembling hypocrite, that he will not at all times call vpon God: neither will ſet his conſtant and continuall delight, in God. A fearefull thing we know it is, to be an hypocrite, whoſe portion is hell fire. Mat. 24.51.<note place="margin">Matth. 24.51.</note> it is ſaid, <hi>the Lord of the euill ſeruant ſhall cut him off, and ſhall giue him his portion with hypocrites, where ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> If thou wilt haue no part nor portion in this lot of hypocrites, bee no hypocrite: delight in the Lord, which hypocrites doe not, neither can doe; and ſo thou ſhalt auoid it. On the contrary, this holy ioy, is a note of a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and regenerated by the Spirit of God. Read Gal. 5.22. <hi>The fruite of the ſpirit, is loue, ioy, peace, long ſuffering, gentlenes,</hi>
