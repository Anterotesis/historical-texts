            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T having been wonder'd at by <hi>some,</hi> and
expostulated by <hi>others,</hi> why having fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
these papers so many Moneths
since, and fully prepared them for the
Press, I should have carried my self to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
them with so much indifference
and neglect, as to have laid them quite aside like things
forgotten &amp; out of mind, not vouchsafing them the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
to enjoy the End of their Conception, I am moved
now at last to <hi>pay</hi> my Reader that little <hi>Debt,</hi> which my
<hi>voluntary Promise</hi> hath made his <hi>Due;</hi> To wit, a <hi>sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey</hi>
of that <hi>Epistle,</hi> which was prefixed, by D. <hi>Rey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nolds,</hi>
to Mr. <hi>Barlee's Satyre.</hi> And to the making of
this <hi>Survey,</hi> I was somewhat more <hi>Invited,</hi> by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
<hi>Difference,</hi> which I observed, betwixt <hi>that</hi>
Adversary, and <hi>This.</hi> For in my <hi>former Defensative,</hi>
I was enforced to wipe off many <hi>Personal Aspersions,</hi>
which was a very unpleasing and irkesom Task; whereas
<hi>now</hi> having to do with a <hi>Nobler Adversary,</hi> who is
<hi>less</hi> apt to lead me from the <hi>subject matter</hi> of our <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,</hi>
I cannot choose but think it a <hi>happy change,</hi> and
suppose that my Reader will think so too, as that which
affords us so much more both of <hi>ease,</hi> and <hi>pleasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this is not all. For I cannot but hold my self <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged</hi>
(that I may not say <hi>Invited</hi> only) to plead as bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb facs="tcp:100717:3"/>
and as publickly in the <hi>behalf</hi> of <hi>sound Doctrines,</hi> as
<hi>other</hi> men have adventured to plead <hi>against</hi> them. I say,
I hold my self <hi>obliged</hi> by these <hi>ensuing Consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, the <hi>Merit</hi> of those <hi>Doctrines</hi> for which I plead;
which seem to me to be Doctrines of so great <hi>moment</hi> &amp;
<hi>importance,</hi> that according as the subjects about which
they are conversant, are either <hi>truly</hi> or <hi>falsely</hi> stated,
they are apt to shed either the <hi>best</hi> or the <hi>worst</hi> kind of
<hi>Influence</hi> upon our <hi>Lives.</hi> The <hi>summ</hi> of that which I
<hi>contend for</hi> is briefly this. <q>That the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi>
hath not <hi>appointed</hi> any Creature to do <hi>wickedly,</hi> but
<hi>hateth sin</hi> with an <hi>unfeigned</hi> &amp; <hi>perfect Hatred,</hi> &amp;
doth <hi>not</hi> give a <hi>necessity</hi> to <hi>all Events,</hi> but to those
<hi>alone</hi> which are agreeable to his <hi>Holiness,</hi> and are
the <hi>objects</hi> of his <hi>absolute unconditional Decree;</hi>
That God's <hi>Decree</hi> of <hi>Reprobatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  </hi> was eternally <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective,</hi>
&amp; respective of <hi>sins</hi> as well <hi>actual,</hi> as <hi>origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;</hi>
That Gods <hi>Decree</hi> of <hi>Election</hi> was eternally <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective</hi>
of our being in <hi>Christ,</hi> and of our <hi>abiding
in him unto the end;</hi> That God's <hi>Execution</hi> of his
Decrees are in a <hi>just Conformity</hi> to his Decrees; That
Iesus Christ is a <hi>General,</hi> but a <hi>Conditional Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi>
a Saviour to <hi>all</hi> who do the <hi>duties</hi> by him <hi>requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi>
to <hi>none</hi> without it; That they who <hi>stand</hi> may

               </q>
These, I say, are the <hi>Doctrines</hi> that I contend for, and
the most <hi>necessary Doctrines</hi> by which to <hi>disabuse</hi>
the <hi>Understanding,</hi> wheresoever we attempt to <hi>reform</hi>

(with such sad Greek, such ruful Latin,
such Incongruities even of English, such

pass with the <hi>Author</hi> of this <hi>Epistle</hi> for no less than an <hi>Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100717:10"/>
and learned Answer,</hi> It is matter to me of admiration,
whether he <hi>read</hi> what he commended <hi>before</hi> he commended
it, or only spake at a venture, but read it <hi>not.</hi> For if he read
it in <hi>good earnest</hi> (as he professeth afterwards to have done)
I admire his <hi>Patience</hi> very much, but very much more his
<hi>Partiality;</hi> in that he could see, (or <hi>oversee)</hi> so many fruits
of the flesh, and so much filthinesse of the Spirit, so many
weaknesses of Reasoning, with such profound wants of
Logick, and then be <hi>thankeful</hi> for the perusal of (what he
calleth) <hi>an Elaborate and learned</hi> Piece. But if he did <hi>not</hi> read
what he commended, my admiration doth still increase;
for he should neither have told us that he <hi>did,</hi> nor have
commended what he did <hi>not.</hi> And therefore</p>
                  <p>§. 2. Secondly, As it affords me matter of <hi>wonder,</hi> so doth
it also of <hi>Humiliation,</hi> to find my self <hi>thus commended</hi> for
I know not what <hi>Polite parts of wit and learning,</hi> both in
the very <hi>page,</hi> and by the very same <hi>Pen,</hi> by which the
<hi>Correptory Correptor</hi> is so much <hi>prais'd. Wit</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi>
are two things, of which I find I have <hi>lesse</hi> than a very <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
proportion.</hi> The comfort is, I find a full <hi>supply</hi> in my
<hi>Cause</hi> for the utmost <hi>Defects</hi> which I have discerned in my
<hi>self.</hi> The very <hi>Nakednesse</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> is that alone which
enables me to make it good. <hi>Wit</hi> and <hi>Learning</hi> are <hi>noxious
weeds,</hi> till they are seasoned by <hi>Grace,</hi> and (by the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
influence of <hi>That)</hi> attended with <hi>singlenesse</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.</hi>
The highest <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>commendation</hi> (as I conceive)
is to worship the God of Heaven in the <hi>sincerity</hi> of <hi>obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi>
to be a man <hi>without guil;</hi> not to <hi>act,</hi> or <hi>design,</hi> or
so much as <hi>imagin</hi> or <hi>wish</hi> mischief to any <hi>Enemy,</hi> much
less to <hi>undermine</hi> or <hi>invade</hi> a <hi>Neighbour,</hi> by secret <hi>fraud,</hi> or
open <hi>violence;</hi> but rather to suffer the <hi>greatest</hi> injury, than
to offer the very <hi>least.</hi> A Heathen may be <hi>learned,</hi> an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist
<hi>witty,</hi> and a Devil may be <hi>both</hi> in great Abundance.
Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> told me, more than once, that I had <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallant
parts,</hi> by the same Token that he told me, I was <hi>not
a little proud of them.</hi> He (I say) would needs <hi>commend</hi>

of his attempt, he hath enforced me to feel by his

                  <p>§. 1. IT seems the Authority of <hi>King Iames</hi> is of great
<hi>weight</hi> with him; And (since it hath made it his
own <hi>choise</hi> to imbue his Reader in the <hi>first place</hi>
with the <hi>judgements</hi> and <hi>censures</hi> of that <hi>wise King)</hi>
I am heartily glad to find it is so. For although that King
in his <hi>younger years</hi> had imbibed and suckt in, even before
he was aware, that Presbyterian opinion of the <hi>genevizing
Scotish Kirk</hi> (which no man living will think strange who
knows the place of his <hi>Birth,</hi> and his <hi>Education,)</hi> yet in his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100717:12"/>
                     <hi>riper and wiser years</hi> he found so great reason to <hi>retract</hi> and
<hi>abjure</hi> his former error, that he readily accepted of <hi>Bishop
Mountagues appeal,</hi> and <hi>commanded</hi> it to be <hi>printed,</hi> and to
be <hi>dedicated</hi> also to his <hi>royal self,</hi> when even <hi>this</hi> was the
Doctrine appealed for. <hi>[That the children of God may fall
away, according to the Tenor of our sixteenth Article,]</hi> which
saith, that <hi>[After we have received the Holy Ghost, we may
depart from Grace given and fall into sin, and by the Grace of
God we may rise again, and amend our lives.]</hi> Which the
<hi>King</hi> perceiving to be the <hi>words</hi> and <hi>mind</hi> of the<note n="*" place="margin">Compare the 16.

                     <hi>Church</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> and that <hi>Bertius</hi> had discerned it a great deal
sooner than <hi>himself,</hi> he did not think it <hi>below</hi> him to grow
in <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Wisdom,</hi> as well as years. To <hi>forsake</hi> an
error, &amp; <hi>repent,</hi> is an <hi>ingenuous and valiant,</hi> as well as <hi>pious,</hi>
nay farther, a <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>Princely</hi> thing. Therefore <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancthon</hi>
was not ashamed to <hi>write against</hi> that opinion
which he had <hi>formerly</hi> been of. And my <hi>contemptible</hi> self,
till I was <hi>Master of Arts</hi> of half a years standing, was as
<hi>fully,</hi> if not as <hi>fiercely,</hi> of Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> his opinion in these
Controversies, as Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> himself appears to be. But
when by reading <hi>better Books</hi> than I had formerly done, and
by <hi>conversing</hi> with better <hi>company,</hi> and by <hi>not-resisting</hi> the
<hi>Grace</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> I look't <hi>through</hi> the <hi>fallacies</hi> wherewith I
had been blinded, and observed the <hi>uglinesse</hi> of their <hi>looks</hi>
whilst <hi>now</hi> I beheld them without their <hi>Visard,</hi> I was gladder
to be recovered from those diseases of my Soul, than from
the painfullest maladies which have ever happened to my
body. And if my <hi>Reverend Antagonist</hi> is not affraid of a
<hi>recovery,</hi> as that which <hi>implyes</hi> him to have been <hi>sick,</hi> He
may <hi>change</hi> his judgement, as I have <hi>done,</hi> though not <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause</hi>
I have done it. At least <hi>King Iames,</hi> and Bishop <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi>
and good <hi>Melancthon,</hi> and the late <hi>Primate</hi> of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magh,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Of his <hi>change</hi> I have <hi>witness</hi> beyond <hi>exception.</hi>
                     </note> and learned Dr. <hi>Potter,</hi> are sure most worthy his

                  <p>§. 2. In the second place, I offer him this short <hi>Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma.</hi>
Is a mans <hi>later</hi> opinion to be <hi>preferred</hi> before his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
or is it not? If he say, <hi>Yes,</hi> His own example of <hi>King
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100717:13"/>
Iames</hi> doth fly back into his Face. But if he say, <hi>No,</hi> His <hi>only
Father S. Austin</hi> must be neglectfully cast behind his <hi>Back.</hi>
And by necessary consequence, his <hi>worthy Friend</hi> Mr. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee</hi>
(in the plausiblest part of all his <hi>Plea)</hi> must be contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly

<hi>And if it was charitable or pertinent to set upon me in such

<hi>King Iames</hi> his <hi>judgement and authority</hi> is of any weight or

concern'd to plead for any farther than my <hi>Assaylant</hi> hath

weight against the Sect of <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> of which <hi>Arminius</hi>
himself was <hi>One.</hi> The <hi>Danger</hi> and <hi>Distemper</hi> which this
<hi>controversie caused</hi> to the <hi>Belgick Nation,</hi> (if it must be said
to have risen from the <hi>controversie</hi> in hand) arose from that

I could easily Remonstrate, were this a place for so much

I seriously advise my Reverend Adversary, that in his

pleas'd to <hi>think twice,</hi> before he <hi>utters his</hi> Conceptions; that
he will look round about him, and <hi>grasp</hi> the whole matter

doth contradict the <hi>Former</hi> with the <hi>Latter</hi> part of this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph.
He doth acknowledge, <hi>that in disputes, soft words
and hard Arguments are best;</hi> for which, besides his own
<hi>judgement,</hi> he cites <hi>Tertullian.</hi> (A Father as <hi>contrary</hi> to his
opinions, as he is worthy to be <hi>cited</hi> where he <hi>condemns</hi>
them.) <q>And yet he <hi>denyes not but that the case may be so,
that in writings of this nature there may be a necessity,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
But let him now speak out, was the <hi>case</hi> so <hi>here,</hi> or was it
<hi>not?</hi> If this was the <hi>Case,</hi> and this a <hi>Writing</hi> of such a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
then what <hi>truth</hi> can there be in his <hi>own,</hi> and <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>'s,
and the <hi>aged holy Divines judgement?</hi> And if this
was not the <hi>Case,</hi> we have here an <hi>Advocate</hi> of <hi>Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
as well as of <hi>unconditional Decrees,</hi> who pleadeth the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity</hi>
of that thing which he confesseth to be an evill.
Whereby he <hi>patronizeth</hi> Mr. <hi>Barlees sin,</hi> and helps to make

<hi>Tacitus</hi> his observation,<note place="margin">Tacit. Anal. l 3. verb. ult.</note> touching the effigies of

I cannot but with grief be sensible of so high a

against <hi>Arminius,</hi> I have already <hi>mollified</hi>
and <hi>soften'd</hi> in my <hi>second Chapter.</hi> This is his <hi>second hard
Argument,</hi> the many <hi>soft parts</hi> of which I shall discover and
demonstrate by these degrees. First, That <hi>Distinction</hi>
which I made was in my p. 23. where I did not instance or
exemplifie in any man whatsoever, much less in <hi>Calvin</hi> and
Dr. <hi>Twisse,</hi> (as every Reader may <hi>see</hi> and <hi>witnesse;)</hi> but to
render me <hi>unacceptable</hi> to every <hi>lover</hi> of those <hi>two,</hi> he is fain
to leap as far back as to my p. 9. &amp; 10. where yet I did not
name them neither; but only set down their own words,
amounting in brief to this <hi>effect</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>[That all things</hi> (and by
consequence <hi>all sins) do happen not only by God's prescience,
but by his positive decree.</hi> That <hi>men do sin by God's impulse;</hi>
and <hi>execute</hi> as well as <hi>contrive</hi> all <hi>mischief,</hi> not by God's
<hi>permission only, but by his Command</hi> too. <hi>That God makes
Angels and Men Transgressors.</hi> That <hi>Adultery or Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
is the work of God; that God is its Author,</hi> (and which

that God's <hi>Will doth passe, not onely into the permission of the

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100717:18"/>
the <hi>horrible affirmations,</hi> which I there inserted as a <hi>specimen</hi>

they found them <hi>growing,</hi> and to manifest a <hi>Duty</hi> incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent
on me, to <hi>vindicate God</hi> from those <hi>Aspersions.</hi> The
Author's <hi>Names</hi> I very obligingly <hi>concealed,</hi> that no <hi>ordinary</hi>
Reader might know <hi>who</hi> they were; but yet I quoted their
<hi>works</hi> where they were <hi>legible</hi> and in <hi>print,</hi> that <hi>extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
Readers might find me <hi>Faithful</hi> in my Quotations, and
that an <hi>Enemy</hi> might not say, that I had only obtruded mine

like to the <hi>effigies</hi> of <hi>Cassius</hi> and <hi>Brutus,</hi> that Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
knew not what I meant by them; no, nor the <hi>Author</hi> of
this <hi>Epistle,</hi> when he perused that <hi>Declamation.</hi> For if he

                  <p>§. 2. Secondly, when I said that some were for <hi>Ligonem,
Ligonem,</hi> (but did not name <hi>any Creature)</hi> I meant such
bold and <hi>barefac'd Sinners,</hi> wh have spoken even in <hi>print</hi>
the very worst Blasphemies of God Almighty, that the
malicious <hi>Wit</hi> of <hi>Hell</hi> hath ever been able to <hi>invent.</hi> 
                     <q>As
for Example, <hi>That God made Man on purpose that he
might Sin, and that he might have something to damn him
for justly. That the necessity of Sinning is cast upon Men by
Gods own ordination That God is the Author of all evil,
as well of Sin as of Punishment;</hi> not only of <hi>those Actions in
and with which Sin is, but of the very Pravity, Ataxy, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,
Irrigularity, and sinfulnesse it self which is in them;
yea, that God hath more hand in Mens Silfulnesse than they
themselves. That God doth Necessitate Men to Sin, Incite,
Seduce, Impel, Compel, Pull, and Draw, and Command Men
to Sin, injects Deceptions, and Tempts Men unto Sin.</hi>
With a numberlesse company of like Expressions,</q> a

If such of these are no <hi>Blasphemies,</hi> then am not I to be

are <hi>Blaspemies</hi> in <hi>grain,</hi> and published to the world by the
<hi>Authors</hi> of <hi>them,</hi> and if the <hi>Authors</hi> of these <hi>Blasphemies</hi> are
led into them by those <hi>opinions</hi> which my Reverend Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
<hi>asserteth,</hi> and I <hi>resist,</hi> how will he make me a <hi>reparation</hi>
for having <hi>publickly</hi> done me so great a <hi>wrong,</hi> as to <hi>blame</hi>
me for my <hi>distinction?</hi> How can he answer to all <hi>good Men,</hi>
to the <hi>Church</hi> of God, and to God himself, that it <hi>was</hi>
                     <q>

Is it not a <hi>Blasphemy</hi> to speak <hi>against God?</hi> Is it not
the very <hi>blackest</hi> and most <hi>insufferable-Blasphemy</hi> to speak
against the very <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>holinesse</hi> of God? Is not his <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
himself?</hi> and therefore it is not <hi>worse</hi> to <hi>asperse</hi> his <hi>puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi>

of <hi>words</hi> and <hi>phrases</hi> hath been <hi>used</hi> even in <hi>print</hi> (by the

the Reader may observe a very <hi>remarkable Concession</hi> in

only <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Martyr.</hi> Secondly, if <hi>any</hi> shall so affirm,
they are <hi>all</hi> of them <hi>guilty</hi> without exception; of which the
reason must needs be this, because they do <hi>all</hi> without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
hold the very <hi>same principles</hi> of <hi>irrespective Decrees
of Reprobation,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>the absolute necessity of all events,</hi>
from whence <hi>any</hi> of them do draw such <hi>detestable conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
Thirdly, that they are <hi>all</hi> of them <hi>guilty</hi> of <hi>horrible
blasphemy and wickednes,</hi> if there is any <hi>Truth</hi> in that <hi>suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition.</hi>

that if <hi>Doctor Whitaker</hi> had observed such affirmations of

it so great an</hi> Injury <hi>to God Almighty, to say that</hi> sins are
<q>committed because God predestin'd that they should be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
<hi>that he believes</hi> those words had been injuriously
spoken, had they been spoken of the Devil, <hi>because the</hi>
Devil <hi>himself can but</hi> sollicit, <hi>and not</hi> compel <hi>us to do
wickedly. And</hi> therefore God <hi>(saith he)</hi> did not predestin
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:100717:27"/>
that any of those things should be done.—<hi>He</hi> was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
that such a wicked soul would be, and for saw that
he would judge it for such commissions. Nor can any thing
more be referred to Gods Predestination, than that he doth
render Iustice where it is due, and bestow mercy where it is
not.]</q> 
                     <hi>This is the</hi> Sum <hi>of that famous</hi> Chapter. <hi>Which
is as contrary to the Doctrine of Mr.</hi> B. <hi>and his</hi> Masters,
<hi>as any thing can be invented. The chief thing observable
I take to be this, that, though there was</hi> nothing <hi>in the</hi>
                     <q>objection, <hi>but that,</hi> when Servants kill their Masters, or
Parents vitiate their Daughters, it is therefore done, because
God Predestin'd that it should be done;</q> 
                     <hi>yet</hi> Prosper <hi>takes it
for</hi> granted <hi>in the very</hi> beginning <hi>of his</hi> answer, <hi>That God
is</hi> inferred, <hi>by</hi> those words <hi>in the objection, to be the</hi>
Author and Incentor of such abominations. <hi>Of which if the</hi>
Devil <hi>were</hi> accused, <hi>he might in part</hi> clear himself, <hi>because he</hi>
enforceth no man to sin, <hi>but only</hi> helps <hi>and</hi> assists <hi>him in it.
Observe now the</hi> contrariety <hi>betwixt</hi> Prosper <hi>and</hi> those men
<hi>whom I</hi> oppose. <q>Prosper <hi>saith</hi> [It is a madness to refer that
to Gods Counsel <hi>or</hi> Purpose which cannot wholly be ascribed
to the Devil himself.]</q> 
                     <hi>yet (saith</hi> Piscator) <hi>God made
men [hoc</hi>

                     <hi>consilio]</hi> with this counsel, or to this purpose,
that they really might sin.] <hi>Again</hi> Prosper <hi>saith, that</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of those affairs was predestin'd by God that it should be
done. <q>
                        <hi>Yet (saith Mr.</hi> Barlee) God wills that sin should fall
out, <hi>p.</hi> 78. He is an absolute determiner in a soveraign way
of the several acts of obedience, and <hi>Disobedience</hi> in relation
to <hi>Them, <hi>p.</hi>
                        </hi> 88.</q> He did voluntarily decree that sin shall
fall out, <hi>p. 73. (nor can Mr.</hi> B. <hi>mean a</hi> conditional, <hi>but an</hi>
absolute Decree, witness his principles, &amp; what he saith, <hi>p. 88.)</hi>
                     <q>He doth determine that sin shall be done, <hi>p. 79. and</hi> may be
said to tempt men unto-sin, </q> 
                     <hi>ibid. and many the like, but

God doth justly when he necessitates men to sin, because he hath
the power to govern as he will; that God worketh all things in

<hi>Zuinglius.</hi> But here he <hi>miscarries</hi> in as many respects as it
was possible. For first, I did civilly conceal their <hi>names.</hi>
Secondly, I cited their <hi>naked words,</hi> and therefore could
not charge them <hi>falsely;</hi> if the words did <hi>blush</hi> to be seen in
<hi>English,</hi> the fault was theirs who first <hi>divulged</hi> them in
<hi>Latin.</hi> Thirdly, they were not all <hi>Instruments</hi> in the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
of the Church;</hi> for Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> and Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi>
were far from being <hi>Contemporaries,</hi> and (as to the matters

Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> had his <hi>part,</hi> and <hi>presided,</hi> was far from being a

what I transcribed out of their <hi>works;</hi> or if they had done
it, their crimes had been but so much the <hi>greater;</hi> nor am
I to be Blamed, if other Men will say <hi>foul things</hi> in <hi>print,</hi>
and then <hi>disavow</hi> the having said them. Fifthly, Doctor
<hi>Twisse</hi> his speeches made up <hi>half</hi> my Catalogue; and so far
have <hi>they</hi> been from being <hi>fully wiped off by a whole Cloud of
learned Writers,</hi> that of the 31. Writers whom my <hi>Reverend

so far is Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> from excusing the <hi>Sublapsarians,</hi> that he

                     <note n="h" place="margin">This the Reverent As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailant might have found in the Book by him mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned called <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>love to mankind.</hi> p. 3. And he alone is to be thanked for this Citation.</note>

he could possibly have spoken) and as if this were not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough,
he farther declared in the <hi>Synod, [that except these
things were held and maintained by them, they must come o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to the Remonstrants.]</hi> The Reader may now judge
what is meant by my <hi>Assailant</hi> when he saith, that the <hi>charge</hi>
which is brought against his party, is so <hi>fully wiped off</hi> by
blunt <hi>Maccovius,</hi> aad such as <hi>He.</hi> But what was done to
<hi>Maccovius</hi> for those expressions? He was pronounced in
the <hi>Synod</hi> to be <hi>pure and Orthodox,</hi> and only admonished
as a Brother, <hi>to take heed hereafter of such words, as might
give offence to tender Ears,</hi> and <hi>could not well down with
those, who are yet uncapable of such Mysteries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 2. By these three or four men, it will be easie to judge
of all the rest in his <hi>Inventory,</hi> to whom notwithstanding
I should have spoken in particular, if He had ventured to
set down any <hi>one</hi> of their <hi>words:</hi> and had he seen any thing
in them to his <hi>Advantage,</hi> I make no doubt but I should
soon have heard of it, at least the <hi>Correptory Correptor</hi>
would have found it out, whom it concern'd so <hi>nearly,</hi> and
for whose <hi>assistance</hi> this Catalogue was so <hi>professedly</hi> inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.
But I have made it appear, that he hath <hi>wiped</hi> them
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:100717:38"/>
                     <hi>fouler</hi> (if fouler may be) than they seemed to be before he
<hi>wip'd</hi> them, (as I have seen some <hi>Houses,</hi> which however
unclean in other respects, yet the <hi>uncleanest</hi> thing of all
hath been the <hi>Beesome.)</hi> So that the <hi>utmost</hi> which I learn
from the <hi>long Catalogue</hi> of writers, is this; that my <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend

being of his party do write in <hi>favour</hi> of his <hi>opinions,</hi>
that is, of their own; and being <hi>naturally</hi> willing to be <hi>well</hi>

                  <p>§ 4. If there were any possibility of excusing the <hi>words</hi>
and <hi>expressions</hi> of my <hi>Assailant's Party,</hi> why should he
make it his last refuge to judge of their <hi>words</hi> by their <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
when all that are <hi>Mortals</hi> have thought it fitter, to
judge of mens <hi>Intentions</hi> by the signification of their <hi>words?
God alone,</hi> (we all grant) is the <hi>searcher</hi> of the <hi>heart</hi> and the
infallible <hi>discerner</hi> of mens <hi>Intentions.</hi> Yet as my <hi>Correptory
Correptor</hi> did make it his <hi>ordinary practice;</hi> to confute my
<hi>heart,</hi> and report my <hi>thoughts,</hi> and quarrel with my <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi>
when he found my words were <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>candid,</hi> and
so cross to his <hi>ends,</hi> as not to be liable in the <hi>least</hi> to his <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions;</hi>
so here my Reverend <hi>Antagonist</hi> on the contrary
<hi>extreme</hi> (which is indeed much the <hi>better)</hi> will needs be <hi>sure
that his Brethren intended no more than</hi> Austin <hi>before them
did say.</hi> And again, that they <hi>intended no more than by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes
of places of Scripture they were led unto.</hi> Suppose it
were possible, that he being but a <hi>man</hi> should know their
<hi>Intentions</hi> however <hi>different</hi> from their <hi>words,</hi> yet he cannot
but remember, that I accused their <hi>words,</hi> not their <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
And I judged of their <hi>words</hi> by what they <hi>signifyed,</hi>
not by what they did <hi>conceale.</hi> If we may judge of their
<hi>Intentions</hi> by such Interpreters as <hi>Maccovius, Piscator,
Zuinglius, Peter Martyr,</hi> and the like, and if such men may
be allowed to judge of <hi>intentions</hi> by <hi>words,</hi> (such as I have
mentioned <hi>Chap.</hi> 4. § 6. &amp; 7.) then I have made it appear,
that I have hit their <hi>intentions</hi> too.</p>
                  <p>§ 5. But let us look a little more <hi>neerly</hi> into his words
<q>
                        <hi>[sure we are,—that protestant Divines have intended no
more than</hi> Austin <hi>before them did say,</hi>
                     </q> &amp;c.) 1. <hi>Protestant
Divines</hi> is very <hi>equiuocally</hi> spoken. For those that are of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:100717:39"/>
the <hi>Remonstrant's</hi> opinions are known to be <hi>Protestants</hi> as
well as <hi>others,</hi> of whom notwithstanding he will not aver,
that they intend no more than <hi>Austin</hi> said. 2. The <hi>Papists,</hi>
(as he confesseth of <hi>Baronius,</hi> and must confess of many
<hi>more)</hi> dislike receding from S. <hi>Austin,</hi> as much as any of
their kinsmen, the <hi>Prebyterians;</hi> which proves the <hi>not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>receding</hi>
from <hi>Austin</hi> to be not the least <hi>character</hi> of a
<hi>Protestant Divine.</hi> 3. Hath <hi>Austin</hi> any where said what I
cited out of those men? If my <hi>Opponent</hi> will produce either
the <hi>same</hi> expressions or others <hi>equal</hi> to them, then will
<hi>He</hi> (not I) be the <hi>accuser</hi> of S. <hi>Austin.</hi> But as he <hi>hath not</hi>
done it, so I have reasons to believe he is <hi>not able.</hi> 4. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
there had been such <hi>profanenesse</hi> in any part of <hi>Austins</hi>
writings, this would only have inferred he was not then
Saint <hi>Austin.</hi> Nor would <hi>falshood</hi> have been the <hi>better</hi> for
having proceeded out of his <hi>mouth.</hi> He that shall say the
<hi>child</hi> is <hi>damn'd</hi> that is not <hi>baptized</hi> before he dyes, or that

say he <hi>means</hi> no more than <hi>Austin said,</hi> but yet he must be
taught to <hi>mend</hi> his <hi>meaning</hi> and his <hi>words</hi> too. The truth
'ont is, <hi>Austin</hi> was not only a <hi>Learned,</hi> but a <hi>well-natur</hi>'d

                  </p>
                  <p>§ 6. Whereas my <hi>Assailant</hi> is pleas'd to add, that <hi>they
intended no more than by multitudes of places of Scripture they
were led unto,</hi> (referring by <hi>figures</hi> to <hi>many</hi> Texts, but in
<hi>words at length</hi> not naming <hi>One,)</hi> I have several things in
answer to him. First who <hi>told</hi> him, that they <hi>intended</hi> no
more? or that places of <hi>Scripture</hi> did <hi>lead</hi> them to the
speaking of what they speak? 2. What <hi>Errors</hi> or <hi>Heresies</hi>
have there been within Christendome, which have not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
the very same thing, that <hi>multitudes of Scripture did
lead them to their assertions?</hi> 3. Why did he not <hi>compare</hi>
one of the <hi>frightfullest</hi> speeches which I accused with any
<hi>one Text</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> by him producible? 4. Let him
name for the future <hi>one</hi> place of <hi>Scripture,</hi> whereby <hi>Zuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glius</hi>
was led to say, [That <hi>God makes a man Transgressor,</hi>
that <hi>Adultery or Murder is the work of God the Author,
Mover, and Impeller.]</hi> what places of Scripture led <hi>Smou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,
Vermilius, Beza, Triglondius, Musculus, Sturmius
Piscator, Borrhaeus</hi> (not to mention the Doctrines of
Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> Dr. <hi>Twisse,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> and a multitude the
<q>like,) to say <hi>that</hi>
                        <note n="*" place="margin">Note that the several Quotations of these are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed ch. 4. Sect. 3.</note> 
                        <hi>God is the Author of evil, whether of
punishment or of sin? that wicked men sin by the force of
Gods will? that God effecteth those things that are sins?
that his Reprobation is the cause of incurable despair? that
both the Elect and the Reprobates were ordained to sin
<hi>Quatenns Sin:</hi> that he is the cause, not only of the actions
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:100717:40"/>
but of the very defects and privations?</hi> that is, of the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquities,</hi>
                     </q>
                     <hi>irregularities, and sinfulnesses themselves?</hi>
Thus we see who they are whose Doctrines of <hi>irrespective</hi>
and <hi>unconditional Reprobation</hi> (not places of <hi>Scripture)</hi> have
led them to <hi>charge God</hi> with <hi>sinfull actions, sins, sinfulnesse,
metaphysically abstracted,</hi> beyond which no <hi>language,</hi> no
<hi>tongue</hi> can speak; above which no <hi>fancy,</hi> no wit can reach
5. Though the wonder already is very <hi>great,</hi> yet will it
still be much <hi>greater,</hi> if we compare one of the <hi>Texts</hi> by
which they are said to be <hi>led</hi> to their <hi>Intentions</hi> of speaking
thus. The first Text he refers to is, <hi>Gen.</hi> 45. 5, 6, 7, 8. from
which place it is evident, that God is affirmed by <hi>Ioseph</hi> to
be the <hi>Author of much good,</hi> which his guilty <hi>Brethren</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<hi>thought of,</hi> but not at all of the <hi>evil</hi> which <hi>they</hi> thought
against <hi>him.</hi> And it will seem to me somewhat more than
strange, if Dr. <hi>Reynolds</hi> cannot <hi>distinguish</hi> betwixt God's
<note n="*" place="margin">Note here the <hi>Confession</hi> of <hi>Peter Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milius</hi> himself, <hi>that almost all the Fathers,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>Austin</hi> (which is more than <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all)</hi> do interpret <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere ad pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>candum</hi> by <hi>sine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, permitte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re deserere.</hi> Pet.

                     <hi>permitting</hi> or <hi>suffering evil</hi> to fall out by the <hi>wills</hi> of wicked
men, which are <hi>free</hi> to <hi>evil,</hi> and by which they are said
(not to be <hi>unavoidably, fatally,</hi> or <hi>necessarily</hi> wicked, but)
to be <hi>voluntarily,</hi> and <hi>wilfully wicked,</hi> I say it is somewhat
more than strange, if he cannot distinguish betwixt Gods
<hi>permitting</hi> that <hi>evil,</hi> that he might draw <hi>good</hi> out of it, and
his being the <hi>Author</hi> or <hi>Cause</hi> of that <hi>Evill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

was from <hi>God. But before he came to them, they conspired

he was so advanced from one degree to another, that he was

which was <hi>in hand,</hi> and to lead the thoughts of his <hi>Readers</hi>
to <hi>another thing.</hi> Else <hi>why</hi> should he alleage so many Texts
of Scripture (not in <hi>words,</hi> but in <hi>figures)</hi> which were so
wholly <hi>impertinent</hi> to the subject matter of my <hi>charge?</hi> I
had charged some men (whose <hi>words</hi> I produced without

<hi>Reprobates,</hi> for the <hi>effecting</hi> of his <hi>Decree</hi> of <hi>irrespective Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.</hi>
Wherein were <hi>comprehended</hi> (and by those Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors

the very <hi>first sins,</hi> which were committed by <hi>Adam</hi> even
in <hi>Paradise,</hi> and by <hi>Lucifer</hi> even in <hi>Heaven.</hi> Now the
Texts which are referred to by my <hi>Assailant,</hi> in excuse of
those <hi>Blasphemies</hi> which I accused, do only shew the <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment</hi>
of <hi>sin</hi> with <hi>sin,</hi> they being spoken of such <hi>sinners,</hi>
and of such <hi>subsequent sins,</hi> as those <hi>sinners</hi> were <hi>permitted</hi> to
<hi>fail into,</hi> by the just judgment of God upon them, whom
they had <hi>provoked</hi> to <hi>forsake</hi> them, and <hi>leave</hi> them to <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
in revenge of their having <hi>forsaken</hi> him <hi>first,</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled</hi>

<hi>first Text</hi> was no less than <hi>against</hi> his <hi>purpose,</hi> the <hi>rest</hi>
which follow are quite <hi>besides</hi> it. And that no poor soul
may be <hi>betrayed,</hi> by the <hi>false application</hi> of all those <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi>
to think <hi>reverently</hi> of his <hi>sins,</hi> and <hi>irreverently</hi> of his
<hi>God,</hi> I will <hi>denudate</hi> the <hi>falsness</hi> of it by these following
<hi>steps.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, when God is said to <hi>harden</hi> mens <hi>hearts,</hi> to deliver
<hi>them up to a reprobate mind,</hi> to <hi>send them strong Delusions
that they shall believe a lye,</hi> and the like, it is infinitely<note n="*" place="margin">Augustin. ad Simpl. l. 5 c. 2.</note> far
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:100717:42"/>
from being meant of an <hi>efficacious Impulse in God Almighty.</hi>
God never <hi>hardens</hi> any mans <hi>heart,</hi> as the Sun <hi>hardens clay</hi>
by <hi>shining</hi> on it, but as the <hi>Sun hardens wax</hi> by <hi>not shining</hi> on
it; by not <hi>softning</hi> it any longer, and so <hi>leaving</hi> it to
<hi>harden it self.</hi> And that all those <hi>verbs,</hi> [to <hi>harden,</hi> to
<hi>blind,</hi> to <hi>deliver up,</hi> to <hi>send delusions,</hi> to <hi>deceive,</hi> and the
like,] are by an ordinary <hi>Hebraism</hi> only <hi>permissive</hi> in <hi>signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi>
though <hi>active</hi> in <hi>sound,</hi> is placed without all <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie.</hi>
First, by the verdict of <hi>all the</hi>

                     <hi>Fathers</hi> both of the <hi>Eastern</hi> and <hi>We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern

                     <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi>
of the chief <hi>Calvinists</hi> themselves,
that is the <hi>judgement</hi> of the <hi>Fathers.</hi>
Thirdly, by<note n="b" place="margin">Indurare <hi>nihil aliud est quàm</hi> nolle emollire; excaecare, <hi>non</hi> illuminare; repellere, non voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. August. in lib. de praedest. &amp; Gra. cap. 4.</note>

                  <p>But to this my <hi>Assailant</hi> may <hi>object</hi> his other <hi>chief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
2 Sam. 16. 10, 11. where <hi>David</hi> saith of <hi>cursing
Shimei, Let him alone, for the Lord hath bidden him,</hi> which
though urged by Mr. <hi>Barlee,</hi> and sufficiently <hi>answered</hi> by

<hi>catch</hi> them to the <hi>Truth,</hi> by several <hi>Baits.</hi> Thus then I
reason within my self; (1) What God doth <hi>command</hi> us we
<hi>ought</hi> to <hi>do,</hi> and <hi>not to do it,</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

Thence it was not the <hi>mercy,</hi> but <hi>sin</hi> of <hi>Saul,</hi> to <hi>save</hi> the

that <hi>Friend of God purposed,</hi> not by <hi>Cruelty,</hi> but <hi>Faith.</hi>
Heb 11. 7. Hereupon it followes (2) that if God had <hi>bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Shimei</hi> to <hi>curse David</hi> in that <hi>literal sense</hi> wherein we
commonly use the <hi>word, Shimei</hi> (like <hi>Nathan 2 Sam.</hi> 12. 7,

He had <hi>cursed</hi> his <hi>Soveraign,</hi> as <hi>Balaam's Asse</hi> reproved
his <hi>Rider,</hi> and had been every whit as <hi>innocent,</hi> if God had
<hi>literally bid him,</hi> it being as great a <hi>Truth</hi> in <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi>

                     <note n="*" place="margin">Eccl. 15. 12.</note> that <hi>God hath commanded no

he <hi>not;</hi> If he <hi>did sin,</hi> God did <hi>not</hi> literally <hi>command</hi> him,
but <hi>permit</hi> him <hi>only.</hi> If he did <hi>not sin,</hi> nothing is gotten by

to have <hi>acted,</hi> not according to Gods <hi>command,</hi>
but point-blank <hi>against</hi> it, (for every sin <hi>quà tale,</hi> is the

things must inevitably follow; either that <hi>David</hi> was in an

his <hi>sins,</hi> especially his being a <hi>man of blood</hi> (as <hi>Shimei</hi> called

no more, than that God <hi>permitted</hi> him: if the <hi>first</hi> is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
then the <hi>error</hi> of <hi>Davids judgment</hi> (which was very

granted, (but <hi>not</hi> the first,) than <hi>God</hi> was only signified,
<hi>not to hinder,</hi> but to <hi>permit</hi> that <hi>sin of cursing,</hi> and so it
ceaseth to have the <hi>force</hi> of an <hi>objection;</hi> nor is it any the

to <hi>excuse,</hi> that God doth <hi>(not only permit,</hi> but also)
<hi>command,</hi> yea <hi>compel.</hi> His bare <hi>permission of sin</hi> is called a
<hi>fiction,</hi> and <hi>against it,</hi> is set up his <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>Decree,</hi> and
that <hi>Decree</hi> is called <hi>efficacious,</hi> &amp; that <hi>will, transient</hi> into the

And to vindicate the <hi>purity</hi> of the <hi>Almighty</hi> from
such <hi>aspersions,</hi> which are perversely laid upon him by the
<hi>literal</hi> exposition of some Texts which are <hi>figuratively</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed

put the people in <hi>minde,</hi> to understand such <hi>Scriptures</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>figure,</hi> which they find to be <hi>contrary</hi> to
the <hi>plainest Tenor</hi> of <hi>other Scriptures,</hi> and as <hi>contrary</hi> to the
<hi>nature</hi> of a <hi>good and holy God,</hi> so far forth as they are taken
according to the <hi>letter.</hi> For as vvhen St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith, the
<hi>weakness of God, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 18. Yea, and the <hi>foolishness of
God, 1 Cor.</hi> 1. 25. He <hi>doth</hi> and <hi>must</hi> mean according to the

so vvhen God is<note n="t" place="margin">Jer. 4. 10.</note> said to have <hi>deceived the people</hi>
or the <hi>like,</hi> it is and must be meant according to the <hi>figure,</hi>
that he hath <hi>suffered,</hi> or <hi>permitted,</hi> or <hi>left them</hi> to <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,</hi>
and to their <hi>temptations</hi> to be <hi>deceived.</hi> And as it
is a <hi>less sin,</hi> to say that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> vvas a <hi>weak</hi> and a <hi>foolish
speaker,</hi> then that God is capable either of <hi>weakness</hi> or <hi>foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishness;</hi>
so is it also a <hi>lesser sin,</hi> to say, that <hi>Ieremiah</hi> vvas a
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100717:45"/>
                     <hi>deceitful prophet,</hi> than that <hi>God</hi> is a <hi>Deceiver.</hi> which as it

is of the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Man</hi> as <hi>Man.</hi> And therefore, for

                     <hi>first Question,</hi> I will desire him to <hi>consider,</hi> before I go
any farther, That I have not <hi>disparaged,</hi> but <hi>vindicated</hi>
and <hi>cleared</hi> the <hi>Almightiness</hi> of God, from an implicit <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny</hi>

                     </gap>s extended to the <hi>doing</hi> of <hi>those</hi> Things which
do imply a <hi>Contradiction.</hi> The <hi>Infinity</hi> of his <hi>power</hi> is seen
and celebrated in this, that he can do <hi>all things</hi> which are
not <hi>evil,</hi> or <hi>unworthy,</hi> or <hi>unbeseeming</hi> his <hi>Godhead.</hi> He who
out of <hi>Nothing</hi> created <hi>All,</hi> can again (if he please) turn
<hi>all</hi> to <hi>Nothing.</hi> But he cannot so make <hi>things</hi> out of <hi>no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,</hi>
as that they shall be <hi>nothing still.</hi> Nor can he so
turn his <hi>Creatures</hi> into <hi>nothing,</hi> as that they shall <hi>retain</hi>
their own <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Creatures.</hi> He cannot so <hi>deprive</hi> his
<hi>Creatures</hi> of any thing, that they as shall <hi>keep</hi> and <hi>retain</hi> the
things of which they are <hi>deprived;</hi> it being <hi>impossible,</hi> (as
implying a <hi>Contradiction)</hi> to <hi>have</hi> what we <hi>have not,</hi> even
<hi>whilst</hi> we <hi>have it not.</hi> It was of the <hi>Nature</hi> of that Fire in
<hi>Nebuchadnezzars Furnace,</hi> to <hi>scorch</hi> and <hi>burn,</hi> and God
by his <hi>omnipotence</hi> did <hi>determine</hi> that Fire <hi>[illic &amp; tunc ad
hoc unum]</hi> not to burn the three Children. But will
Doctor <hi>Reynolds</hi> say, that the <hi>Fire</hi> at that <hi>instant</hi> and in
that <hi>Case,</hi> did <hi>retain</hi> its own <hi>Nature?</hi> and that it <hi>had</hi> the
power to <hi>burn</hi> them, even whilst it had <hi>not</hi> the power
to <hi>burn</hi> them? these are the <hi>opposite parts</hi> of a <hi>Contradiction,</hi>
which God cannot <hi>verifie,</hi> because he is of <hi>necessity</hi> what he
<hi>is, true,</hi> and <hi>Almighty;</hi> which he could not be, if he could
<hi>verifie Contradictions.</hi> But the most <hi>immediate Reason,</hi> doth
seem to be this, why <hi>God cannot verifie Contradictions;</hi>
even because they have not a <hi>passive power</hi> of being <hi>verified.</hi>
For the <hi>affirming</hi> of the <hi>one</hi> is the <hi>denial</hi> of the <hi>other.</hi> And
they cannot be <hi>both true,</hi> because they should not be <hi>contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions,</hi>
if the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>one</hi> did not make the <hi>other false.</hi>
But this is a thing, which all the world, I suppose, doth
unanimously <hi>grant.</hi> So that as often as we say, God <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not</hi>
do <hi>that</hi> which doth imply a <hi>Contradiction,</hi> we do say in
effect, <hi>He cannot cease to be God;</hi> He <hi>cannot</hi> do <hi>evil;</hi> He
<hi>cannot</hi> do that, which is <hi>therefore impossible, because un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy</hi>
for him to do. He can draw <hi>good</hi> out of <hi>evil</hi> by <hi>dispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi>
                     <pb n="82" facs="tcp:100717:50"/>
of <hi>evill</hi> to <hi>good ends,</hi> but he cannot so make <hi>evil good</hi>
as that the <hi>evil</hi> shall still retain its own <hi>Nature.</hi> He can
<hi>destroy</hi> his <hi>Creature</hi> either in <hi>part,</hi> or in the <hi>whole,</hi> much
more can he <hi>alter</hi> or <hi>change</hi> his <hi>Creature,</hi> but not <hi>so</hi> as that
it shall remain <hi>unaltered</hi> under that <hi>alteration.</hi> God can
<hi>determine</hi> the <hi>will</hi> of <hi>man hic &amp; nunc ad unum,</hi> and so <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive</hi>
the <hi>will</hi> of that part of its <hi>Nature,</hi> but not <hi>so</hi> as that
the <hi>will</hi> shall continue <hi>undeprived,</hi> or retain its <hi>Nature,</hi>
of which it is <hi>deprived,</hi> even <hi>whilst</hi> it is <hi>deprived</hi> of
it. When God <hi>determines</hi> a Man to <hi>one</hi> thing, 'tis certain
he <hi>cannot</hi> do <hi>another,</hi> for if he <hi>can,</hi> he can <hi>resist,</hi> not
Gods <hi>will only,</hi> but his <hi>Power.</hi> And then to say he <hi>retains</hi>
that very <hi>part</hi> of his <hi>corrrupt Nature,</hi> his being able to <hi>sin,</hi>
whilst he is <hi>determin'd</hi> by God's <hi>power</hi> to a <hi>disability</hi> of <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi>
what doth it but imply a <hi>contradiction?</hi> I could be
heartily sorry to find my <hi>Opponent</hi> in this <hi>method,</hi> of raising
and <hi>supporting</hi> the <hi>whole Fabrick</hi> of his <hi>Errors,</hi> upon
that which is not only the greatest <hi>Falshood,</hi> but the greatest
<hi>Impossibility</hi> in all the world, but that by giving me <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity</hi>
(as well as <hi>provocation)</hi> to treat with him here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon,
and to shew him the <hi>Fallacy</hi> or <hi>Quick-sand</hi> on which
he <hi>builds,</hi> I make no doubt but he hath opened a <hi>speedy way</hi>
to his being undeceived; And that he will resolve, upon a
review of his first Question, That when God gives <hi>suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,</hi>
yea and <hi>effectual Grace,</hi> both to <hi>will</hi> and to <hi>do</hi> any
thing that is <hi>good,</hi> he doth not alwayes by his <hi>power</hi> (which
is not <hi>resistible) determine</hi> his Creature <hi>ad hoc unum,</hi> but
permits him to retain so much of his own <hi>Nature,</hi> as the
<hi>liberty</hi> of <hi>sinning,</hi> of <hi>resisting,</hi> or of <hi>grieving</hi> his <hi>Spirit</hi> comes
to, (which <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Reason,</hi> and <hi>daily experience</hi>
doth make apparent.) And that when he doth otherwise,
either in some <hi>one act</hi> here <hi>in viâ,</hi> or else in <hi>all acts</hi> in
<hi>statu comprehensorum,</hi> by <hi>confining</hi> and <hi>determining</hi> the <hi>will
ad hoc unum,</hi> he takes away that <hi>Liberty</hi> or <hi>power</hi> to <hi>sin,</hi>
which was <hi>Natural</hi> to the <hi>Will</hi> before its said <hi>determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>

§. 3. This being said thus largely in Answer to his first
Question, doth put his second out of all possible dispute.
For it being once <hi>supposed</hi> and taken for <hi>granted</hi> by the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary,</hi>
that God by his power doth determin the will <hi>ad
hoc;</hi> the Creature shall not have the <hi>least liberty</hi> to <hi>resist,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Creature is <hi>not stronger</hi> than <hi>God.</hi> But withal it is
as certain, that though God doth only <hi>efficaciously move</hi> the
<hi>will</hi> by his <hi>Grace,</hi> (without interposing his <hi>irresistable power,</hi>
by which he <hi>determins</hi> the will <hi>ad hoc,)</hi> yet there are some
who, <hi>de facto,</hi> do not <hi>victeriously resist;</hi> and therefore
grace <hi>irresistable,</hi> where <hi>

the turn, is not only a <hi>groundlesse,</hi> but a <hi>needless Inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
And if he useth the word <hi>[victoriously]</hi> as if he thought
it a disparagement for the <hi>Grace</hi> of God to be <hi>so resisted,</hi> St.
<hi>Paul</hi> will tell him of a <hi>quenching,</hi> as well as a <hi>grieving,</hi> and

(whom he will own as a <hi>Brother)</hi> that the <hi>Reprobates</hi> in
<hi>Hell</hi> had the <hi>means</hi> of <hi>escaping</hi> their going thither. <q>And
that they had not been there, but that they <hi>forsook God,</hi> and

farther adds, that even <hi>they</hi> who are in <hi>Hell</hi> had <hi>Heaven
purchased for them,</hi> but they <hi>rather</hi> made <hi>choice</hi> to <hi>buy</hi> the
<hi>Flames of Hell so dearly, then to have Heaven on free cost.</hi>
                     </q>
Thus we see, there are some <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> who are sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
convinced of such opinions and <hi>Doctrins,</hi> which by <hi>other

                  <p>§. 4. His <hi>third Question,</hi> like his <hi>second,</hi> is without all
Question, and that which no Man can be <hi>concerned in,</hi> for
it being <hi>supposed</hi> (as by him it is) that the <hi>will</hi> of the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>

                        </gap>erence.</hi> And it is as <hi>certain,</hi> as well as more
to the <hi>purpose,</hi> and <hi>better sense,</hi> that God is able by his

in the Creature a <hi>will</hi> to <hi>good [faciendo ex nole nte volentem]</hi>
and when the Creature is <hi>confirmedly willing,</hi> he will <hi>then</hi>
most <hi>certainly,</hi> in respect of that <hi>change</hi> which is now
wrought in him, and yet most <hi>willingly,</hi> as to its own
manner of working, make <hi>choise</hi> of that <hi>good, &amp;c.</hi> So that
no kind of <hi>strength</hi> is in this part of his <hi>process,</hi> what was
<hi>before</hi> matter of <hi>Question,</hi> remains so still, <hi>viz.</hi> whither in
every Mans <hi>conversion</hi> God doth <hi>determin</hi> his <hi>will ad hoc,</hi> so
as the Man shall not <hi>possibly</hi> be able to <hi>resist</hi> it, and what

                  <p>§. 5. IN this short passage there are <hi>two</hi> of his <hi>strong Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</hi>
One in the <hi>Parenthesis,</hi> and another <hi>out</hi> of
it, I will hasten to try the force of both. First he saith
in the <hi>Parenthesis, that 'twill be difficult to prove that that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Plyes

a contradiction</hi> which was the subject of his <hi>first Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</hi>
To which I answer three things. 1. That which is but
<hi>difficult</hi> may yet be <hi>done;</hi> and therefore it doth not <hi>advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi>
but rather <hi>prejudice</hi> his <hi>Cause,</hi> for <hi>seeming</hi> difficult to

so long as I am not to <hi>encounter</hi> with <hi>Impossibilities.</hi>
For if they are <hi>difficult indeed,</hi> it is but <hi>studying</hi> the <hi>harder</hi>

to be easie, which is here believed to be <hi>difficult.</hi> For
thirdly, I have shewed, (and I hope with perspicuity,)
that to be <hi>determined</hi> by Gods <hi>power</hi> ad bonum hoc, doth
<hi>imply</hi> and <hi>infer</hi> a <hi>disability</hi> to <hi>sin,</hi> in respect of <hi>this good</hi> to
which the <hi>will</hi> is <hi>determined;</hi> and this doth <hi>grosly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict</hi>
the wills <hi>retaining</hi> [in hoc] that <hi>liberity</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> which
doth <hi>confessedly</hi> consist in its <hi>ability</hi> to <hi>sin;</hi> and cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
be denyed in this state of <hi>Imperfection,</hi> unless it be by
the <hi>Ranters,</hi> who corrupt themselves with the opinion
that there is <hi>equal Necessity</hi> of <hi>all Events,</hi> as equally <hi>issuing</hi>
from Gods <hi>absolute Decree.</hi> My <hi>Assailant</hi> speaks of Gods
<hi>Omnipotency,</hi> which could and did say, <hi>let there be light,</hi> &amp;c.
to shew what he means by Gods <hi>power determining the will,</hi>
which is in effect by making it <hi>no will,</hi> and then to call it a
<hi>will</hi> is a <hi>contradiction.</hi> But for this I refer to what I have
spoken so much at large in my <hi>second Section</hi> of this <hi>Chapter.</hi>
I proceed to the reason which he <hi>alledgeth [why may not God
determin the will, as well as the will determin it self?]</hi> to which
I answer that he <hi>may</hi> when he <hi>pleaseth;</hi> but what of that?
Doth it follow that he <hi>doth,</hi> because he <hi>can?</hi> God <hi>may,</hi>
if he <hi>will,</hi> create more <hi>worlds;</hi> and I will ask my <hi>Assailant
[why may he not?]</hi> But I will not argue from thence, that
he therefore <hi>doth,</hi> because he <hi>may;</hi> yet let it be granted that
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:100717:52"/>
he <hi>doth</hi> too (as well in <hi>earth sometimes,</hi> as in <hi>Heaven al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes,)</hi>
that will be found to be <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> and will not
bring the <hi>least advantage</hi> unto my Adversaries <hi>pretensions.</hi>
For the <hi>Question</hi> is not, whether or no he <hi>may,</hi> or <hi>doth,</hi>
but whether <hi>when</hi> he <hi>doth determine the will</hi> hîc &amp; nunc; to
this <hi>one good,</hi> he doth <hi>leave</hi> it in <hi>that act</hi> unto the <hi>liberty</hi> of
its <hi>own Nature,</hi> that is, <hi>hic &amp; nunc free to evill.</hi> This (I
call <hi>him</hi> to <hi>witnesse)</hi> is the very <hi>Question</hi> to be <hi>resumed,</hi> if he
desires not to <hi>pass over ab Hypothesi ad Thesin,</hi> and of this
he speaks not a <hi>word.</hi> But <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>point</hi> to which our
<hi>Attentions</hi> are to be <hi>held,</hi> whilst I give his Question in the
<hi>Parenthesis</hi> (or his <hi>second Argument</hi> proposed by way of
<hi>Question)</hi> a full and satisfactory <hi>Answer.</hi> For first it is <hi>evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,</hi>
that mans <hi>determining</hi> his <hi>own will</hi> is very reconcilable
with the <hi>retaining</hi> of its <hi>Nature;</hi> for 'tis an <hi>act</hi> of his <hi>liberty</hi>
to <hi>choose</hi> the object of his <hi>option,</hi> and by <hi>actually choosing</hi> to
<hi>determine</hi> his <hi>will,</hi> which as soon as he hath <hi>chosen,</hi> then as
to <hi>that</hi> which he hath <hi>chosen</hi> he is not <hi>free;</hi> for <hi>freedom</hi> sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth
him <hi>yet</hi> to <hi>choose;</hi> and when he <hi>hath</hi> determined his
will <hi>ad hoc,</hi> he cannot <hi>in sensu composito,</hi> not have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
it, although <hi>in sensu diviso</hi> he could have <hi>not done</hi> it,
<hi>before</hi> 'twas <hi>done.</hi> Thus we see in <hi>reason</hi> how Man <hi>may</hi> do
it, and in every-dayes <hi>experience</hi> we find how he <hi>doth.</hi> But
(secondly) when <hi>God determins</hi> him by his <hi>power,</hi> irresisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<hi>ad hoc,</hi> that is no more <hi>reconcilable</hi> with the <hi>leaving</hi> of
him <hi>free</hi> or <hi>undetermined,</hi> then the Mans having <hi>actually</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<hi>himself</hi> is reconcilable with the <hi>leaving</hi> himself <hi>free.</hi>
He can no more do <hi>otherwise</hi> when Gods power hath <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined</hi>
him, then he can have <hi>chosen otherwise</hi> when he hath
<hi>actually determined</hi> his will <hi>ad hoc.</hi> Behold this, Reader,

may <hi>move himself</hi> from one place to another; and a <hi>stronger</hi>
Man than he is, may by his <hi>power</hi> do the same. He that
moveth himself by <hi>choise</hi> doth not impeach his own <hi>liberty,</hi>
because he <hi>choos<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>th</hi> to do it <hi>freely.</hi> But if the other Man
move him by his <hi>greater strength</hi> and <hi>power</hi> to do it, he is so
far forth the <hi>strong</hi> Mans <hi>Prisoner,</hi> and so receiveth some
impeachment to his <hi>liberty,</hi> though he may possibly be
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:100717:53"/>
                     <hi>pleased</hi> with his <hi>confinement,</hi> as being <hi>tyed up</hi> in <hi>Golden bands.</hi>
This I say not to <hi>argue,</hi> but to <hi>illustrate</hi> my former <hi>meaning,</hi>
that the <hi>slowest</hi> Reader may <hi>apprehend</hi> it with greater <hi>ease,</hi>
and <hi>expedition.</hi> Again, A Man <hi>determining himself</hi> to any
<hi>one</hi> of <hi>two</hi> competitors, is thereby <hi>cleared</hi> to be <hi>free</hi> to <hi>choose</hi>
the <hi>one,</hi> and <hi>refuse</hi> the <hi>other;</hi> and till he hath chosen one,
doth not <hi>determin</hi> that <hi>freedom,</hi> which by <hi>actual choosing</hi> (we
know) he <hi>doth.</hi> But when <hi>God</hi> by his <hi>power</hi> doth <hi>determin</hi> the
<hi>will of Man</hi> to this or that <hi>very</hi> object, there is no <hi>resisting
that power,</hi> and so no <hi>freedom</hi> to the <hi>Contrary.</hi> So far is the
will from <hi>retaining</hi> any imaginable indifferency, as to that

God <hi>may</hi> give us the <hi>ability to fast,</hi> without eating,

and therefore he <hi>may</hi> do them by that <hi>omnipotency,</hi>
which could give the Creature a <hi>Being</hi> out of <hi>Nothing.</hi>

are the <hi>Courses</hi> which God doth ordinarily <hi>use,</hi> or that
he useth them once in a <hi>thousand yeares;</hi> and if we

when <hi>Christ</hi> is given for all that <hi>Masse,</hi> (as hath been

that God should <hi>frustrate</hi> and <hi>null</hi> the <hi>end</hi> of Christ's

incurring that punishment by his <hi>rejection</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> or by

and the <hi>corrupted masse</hi> in his <hi>Loynes,</hi> every whit as <hi>extrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secal</hi>
to the <hi>Essence</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> as the <hi>actual corruptions</hi> of <hi>Cain</hi>
or <hi>Iudas?</hi> how then doth he dash one part of his arguings
<hi>against another?</hi> If my <hi>Assailant</hi> is willing that <hi>God's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees</hi>
of <hi>Predestination</hi> should have <hi>no motive</hi> from <hi>without
himself,</hi> he must <hi>destroy</hi> his <hi>fourth Thesis,</hi> and all that <hi>lean's</hi>
on it; and in <hi>Reverence</hi> to his <hi>Third</hi> (if he desires to have
it any more then a <hi>may be)</hi> he must presently <hi>set up</hi> for
a <hi>Supralapsarian,</hi> and send a <hi>farewell</hi> to the <hi>Synod</hi> of
<hi>Dort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 2. His fourth position doth declare, that he is for the
<hi>Sublapsarian way,</hi> notwithstanding what he had said but
2 <hi>lines</hi> going before. And here he shew's his <hi>Inconsistence</hi>
with the greatest <hi>Pillars</hi> of his <hi>own</hi> Party, in his stating the
<hi>object</hi> of <hi>Predestination,</hi> and affirming it to be <hi>Massa Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</hi>
For first, herein he sets himself against <hi>Beza,</hi> and all
his followers, who are for <hi>Massa nondum condita.</hi>
Next he disobligeth <hi>Franciscus Iunius,</hi> as able a Card as
most are in the Pack, who is for <hi>Massa condita nec dum cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupta,</hi>
Thirdly, He is at <hi>variance</hi> with <hi>honest Piscator</hi> (as
Mr. <hi>B.</hi> calls him) who is for no less then a <hi>Threefold Masse,
1 nondum condita, 2 condita duntaxat, 3 condita &amp; corrupta.
Fourthly,</hi> he affronteth his own Dr. <hi>Twisse,</hi> whom he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
for his <hi>Acquaintance with the mind of God,</hi> and
who although he prefers <hi>Piscators</hi> opinion before the <hi>rest,</hi>
yet he condemns <hi>Piscators</hi> too; and sets up, in the room,
<hi>who-can-tell-what? Fifthly,</hi> He opposeth the famous <hi>Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
of <hi>Sedan,</hi> who <hi>slits</hi> the <hi>Truth</hi> in the <hi>midst,</hi> and (as to
this particular) hath one foot in the <hi>Consistorie,</hi> but ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the <hi>Church.</hi> Touching the object of <hi>Election,</hi> hee
holds indeed with the <hi>Calvinists;</hi> but touching the object
of <hi>Reprobation,</hi> he runs full speed with the <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:100717:62"/>
Sixthly, He differs from Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> differs
from <hi>himself,</hi> who although in the <hi>general</hi> for <hi>Massa Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupta,</hi>
yet he is sometimes also for <hi>nondum condita.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthly,
he <hi>despiseth</hi> his Reverend Friend Mr. <hi>Barlee,</hi> who
professeth to be a <hi>good friend to both the upper</hi> and <hi>lower way,</hi>
though Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> hath<note n="h" place="margin">Twiss. vind. Gra. l. 1. par. 1. Digr. 4. Sect. 4. c. 2. p. 84.</note> discovered a very <hi>great Gulf fixt</hi>
betwixt the <hi>one,</hi> and the <hi>other;</hi> and saith that they of the
<hi>lower way,</hi> whilst they try to <hi>escape</hi> the <hi>darts</hi> of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
are <hi>compell'd</hi> to <hi>fight</hi> under their <hi>Banner.</hi> Well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
said Mr. <hi>Barlee,</hi> that he is for <hi>both,</hi> that is, for <hi>neither,</hi>
because indeed he is for <hi>nothing</hi> unless for <hi>Correptory Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi>
To satisfie my Reader for my being thus <hi>long,</hi> I
ought to be a little <hi>longer,</hi> that I may tell him the pretty
<hi>Iest</hi> of Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> his arguing, against <hi>all</hi> his <hi>Friends</hi> and
<hi>Admirers</hi> without exception; and though he builds upon
a <hi>Fallacy,</hi> yet his Friends are so far from having seen where
it lyes, that they have <hi>swallowed</hi> it down as a <hi>postulatum;</hi>
and because they use it as a <hi>medium</hi> against the doctrine
of the <hi>Remonstrants,</hi>

Here we see it is evident, that Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> doth heap the
greatest <hi>disgraces</hi> upon the <hi>Calvinistical</hi> opinion in the <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod</hi>
at <hi>Dort,</hi> that can be possibly imagined. For he affirmeth
it to infer the <hi>grossest absurdities</hi> in the world, as that men
are damn'd in Hell before the world is created, and actually
punished for sin before the entrance of sin into the world;
things implying <hi>contradictions,</hi> and such as none but <hi>mad
men</hi> can entertain, saith Dr. <hi>Twisse.</hi> Yet <hi>old</hi> Mr. <hi>Whitfield</hi>
is so thankful, for having his <hi>Doctrine</hi> and his <hi>Person</hi> so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly
reproached by Dr. <hi>Twisse,</hi> that he swallowes his
axiom as a <hi>wholsome Bit,</hi> and upon the <hi>strength</hi> of its <hi>nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
he fights (in his <hi>first animadversion)</hi> against the <hi>man</hi>
in the <hi>Moon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 3. In the <hi>fifth position</hi> of my <hi>Rd. Assailant,</hi> I am glad
to find him saying what God <hi>hath</hi> done <hi>ex mero beneplacito,</hi>
no longer <hi>now</hi> what he <hi>may</hi> only. Only I wish he had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
some shew of <hi>reason</hi> and <hi>offered</hi> at least at some kind of
<hi>proof,</hi> that I might have had an <hi>opportunity</hi> to <hi>answer.</hi> But
since he hath <hi>crudely affirmed,</hi> what he <hi>supposeth</hi> to be <hi>true,</hi>
I will patiently expect, untill his leisure will permit him to
prove 3. things. 1. That God <hi>hath</hi> absolutely (not now
that he <hi>may,</hi> but that he <hi>hath)</hi> without <hi>any fore-sight</hi> or <hi>consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration</hi>
how his <hi>talents</hi> will be <hi>used,</hi> chosen some to <hi>glory,</hi> &amp;
left the rest to inherit a <hi>Lake of Fire,</hi> which is <hi>unquenchable.</hi>
2. That his undeserved and free mercy cannot as well be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifested
<hi>another way,</hi> to wit, in giving his free grace, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding
with <hi>infinite unproportionable Ioyes;</hi> very <hi>weak</hi> and
<hi>imperfect,</hi> very <hi>light</hi> &amp; <hi>short obedience.</hi> 3ly, and especially, that
he hath <hi>passed by</hi> others, and left them under <hi>deserved wrath,</hi>
meerly considered in that state which the <hi>First man</hi> brought
upon them, (when yet on the contrary <hi>Christ</hi> was given a
<hi>propitiation</hi> for that <hi>whole Masse,</hi> as the <hi>Scripture</hi> very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly,
and very frequently <hi>affirmeth.)</hi> And 'till these three
things are <hi>proved,</hi> his <hi>sixth proposition</hi> will weigh as <hi>lightly</hi>
as his <hi>fifth.</hi> Because it matters not to inquire, to what
purposes and counsels the <hi>electing</hi> or <hi>rejecting</hi> men in
<hi>Massâ</hi> doth belong, untill it is proved that there is any
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:100717:63"/>
such <hi>thing,</hi> as that in <hi>Massâ</hi> they are <hi>elected</hi> or <hi>rejected.</hi> Nor
is the Question of his <hi>soveraignty,</hi> what he <hi>may,</hi> but of his
<hi>decree,</hi> what he <hi>will;</hi> and what is <hi>revealed</hi> in his <hi>word</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
what he <hi>will</hi> do, which, if it is not there revealed,
we cannot <hi>know.</hi> Just as little material are his <hi>seventh</hi> and
<hi>eighth propositions,</hi> which do wholly stand and <hi>subsist</hi> upon
the <hi>Credit</hi> of the <hi>fifth;</hi> nor must the fifth be <hi>granted</hi> untill
it is <hi>proved.</hi> Yet if care must be taken in the <hi>seventh,</hi> that
this <hi>matter</hi> spoken of be <hi>finally apt and disposed</hi> for the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation
of Gods Glory, and if 'tis <hi>confessed</hi> in the eighth,
that this is actually wrought by the <hi>corrupt will</hi> of the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
then it seems the <hi>Creature</hi> as it lies in <hi>Massâ,</hi> without
any <hi>acts</hi> of its <hi>own corrupt will,</hi> is not <hi>fit</hi> to be <hi>punished,</hi> or
to <hi>manifest</hi> Gods Glory in <hi>being</hi> punished; and if so, then
how could that be <hi>the subject</hi> (in the <hi>fourth proposition) on
which God is absolutely pleased to manifest</hi> the <hi>glory</hi> of his
<hi>Iustice?</hi> In plainer words, If untill the <hi>Creature</hi> hath <hi>actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
sinned,</hi> it is not <hi>[materia apta &amp; disposita]</hi> matter <hi>fitly
disposed</hi> for the eternal <hi>vengeance</hi> of the <hi>Almighty,</hi> or for
the <hi>manifesting</hi> his <hi>Glory</hi> in their eternal <hi>punishment,</hi> then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
my Adversary must acknowledge (upon his own
grounds) that there cannot <hi>in massâ</hi> be any <hi>absolute Preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition.</hi>
Thus his <hi>seventh proposition</hi> is the <hi>destruction</hi> of his
<hi>fifth,</hi> and brings him over to my opinion, by <hi>irresistible
consequence,</hi> even before he is <hi>aware;</hi> for he confesseth that
the <hi>matter</hi> of <hi>Reprobation</hi> must be <hi>fitly disposed,</hi> and that it
must be by the <hi>corrupt will</hi> of the Creature, but he knows
that the Reprobates had no such thing as a <hi>will</hi> when they
were in <hi>massâ,</hi> some <hi>thousands of years</hi> before they were
<hi>born;</hi> and therefore they must be <hi>born,</hi> and have <hi>wills</hi> of
their own, before their <hi>wills</hi> can be <hi>corrupted,</hi> or make
them <hi>matter adapted</hi> for <hi>condemnation,</hi> and <hi>as</hi> they are <hi>in
time,</hi> just so they were <hi>considered</hi> from all <hi>Eternity.</hi> But to
conclude this Chapter. If <hi>all</hi> were granted which is <hi>desired</hi>
in these <hi>eight propositions,</hi> yet would it not come home to
Mr. <hi>Barlee's pretensions,</hi>
                     <note n="k" place="margin">Correp. Cor. p. 88. lin. 8, 9, 11, 12.</note> who saith that God is not <q>

                  </p>
                  <p>§. 2. The <hi>first</hi> is granted by all the world, for <hi>no</hi> man li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
can be so <hi>mad,</hi> as to say, or think, that <hi>God consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>
the <hi>will</hi> of the <hi>Creature</hi> in <hi>decreeing</hi> his <hi>own Glory.</hi> The
<hi>second</hi> is back't with a <hi>shew</hi> of <hi>Reason;</hi> and it runs in this
<hi>Form,</hi> [He <hi>did, for</hi> he <hi>might;]</hi> but <hi>à potentiâ ad Actum
non valet argumentum.</hi> God <hi>might</hi> have made us <hi>all,</hi> as
he did <hi>Adam,</hi> out of the <hi>Earth,</hi> without the methods of
<hi>generation,</hi> and <hi>Birth,</hi> but hence it follows not that he
<hi>did.</hi> Nor was there need of <hi>any</hi> proof, (much <hi>less</hi> of <hi>that</hi>
which was <hi>worse</hi> then <hi>none)</hi> for the confirming of an <hi>asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:100717:65"/>
which <hi>Nothing</hi> in <hi>Christendome</hi> ever <hi>denyed,</hi> for all
unanimously agree, that God did <hi>freely</hi> elect some Angels,
and some men. If any quarrel with him for his <hi>first positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
they must be a <hi>Sect</hi> of his <hi>own party</hi> (which I shewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be multisariously <hi>subdivided)</hi> to wit the <hi>supralapsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians,</hi>
who perhaps will require him to <hi>blot out</hi> the word
<hi>Lapsed,</hi> although they need not to be so <hi>nice.</hi> For that
the <hi>men</hi> who are <hi>elected,</hi> as sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> are <hi>lapsed too,</hi>
Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> himself could not deny. And the <hi>Remonstrants</hi>
do all allow, that <hi>actual sins</hi> suppose a <hi>Lapse.</hi> Only my <hi>As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailant</hi>
must here be <hi>minded,</hi> that by the word <hi>[freely]</hi> he
must not mean <hi>[necessarily</hi> or <hi>unconditionally;]</hi> for if he
does, there is not a <hi>Dictionary</hi> in the world will <hi>bear him
out.</hi> Our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> do <hi>merit nothing,</hi> nor indeed
are they <hi>ours</hi> but by God's <hi>free gift,</hi> nor do they bear any <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion</hi>
with an <hi>eternal</hi> weight of <hi>Bliss</hi> and <hi>Glory;</hi> so that
the <hi>mercy</hi> of God is <hi>free</hi> though it <hi>exacts</hi> somewhat of us to
make us <hi>capable</hi> of it. Which he that ventures to <hi>deny,</hi>
must either deny that God exacts any <hi>Duties</hi> from his
<hi>Elect,</hi> or that the <hi>Graces of God are free.</hi> If the <hi>former,</hi> he
opens a <hi>Dore</hi> unto the <hi>Libertines;</hi> and if the <hi>latter,</hi> he ruins
the <hi>Cause</hi> which he asserteth. He needed not here have
mentioned <hi>Angels;</hi> as not belonging to the matter of which
he <hi>treats</hi> (for they were <hi>never in Adams Loyns)</hi> And of
them he must be told, (since he hath put them into his <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis)</hi>
that <hi>God</hi> eternally <hi>foresaw</hi> that some of them would
<hi>persevere,</hi> and not follow <hi>Lucifer</hi> in his <hi>voluntary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi>
and that for their <hi>voluntary Obedience</hi> he would
<hi>reward</hi> them with <hi>Confirmation.</hi> (So we know he doth
<hi>men,</hi> when he takes them up into their <hi>Masters</hi>
                     <note n="w" place="margin">Mat. 25. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Ioy.</hi>)
which if my <hi>Assailant</hi> will <hi>deny,</hi> I know not what should
<hi>scare</hi> him from Embracing the way of the <hi>Supralapsarians.</hi>
But come we from <hi>Angels</hi> to <hi>men,</hi> of whom in relation to
this matter, the <hi>plain truth</hi> is briefly <hi>this. God was in
Christ</hi>
                     <note n="x" place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>reconciling the world unto himself,</hi> who from all
<hi>eternity</hi> elected, in <hi>Christ,</hi> those that he saw would perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
in the <hi>Faith of Christ</hi> (which <hi>Faith</hi> is not <hi>salvisick,</hi>
unless it<note n="y" place="margin">Gal. 5. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>worketh by Love,</hi> all manner of duty which
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:100717:65"/>
God requires, in whomsoever he doth require it.) And all
this he <hi>did freely,</hi> and justly <hi>might do;</hi> yet he <hi>did</hi> it not
<hi>therefore,</hi> because he <hi>might,</hi> but because he <hi>chose</hi> it as <hi>most</hi>
for his <hi>Glory</hi> to be <hi>done.</hi> And we know he did so, (not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
we know he <hi>might,</hi> but) because he hath been pleased
to <hi>assure</hi> us of it in his <hi>word.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 2. His <hi>third position,</hi> or <hi>proposition,</hi> he could not but
know, would be <hi>denied,</hi> and yet his <hi>offer</hi> of <hi>proof</hi> is very
<hi>feeble.</hi> He know's it is <hi>denied</hi> that <hi>God did leave some lapsed
men</hi> to unavoidable Damnation, <hi>meerly</hi> as lying in <hi>Adams
Loyns;</hi> which he cannot possibly be thought to have done,
if he gave his <hi>own Son</hi> to be a <hi>Ransome</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> for
<hi>Adam's sin,</hi> and a <hi>propitiation</hi> for <hi>all</hi> that were in his <hi>Loyns.</hi>
Which this Reverend Author doth not <hi>once</hi> offer to <hi>deny</hi>
throughout his whole <hi>Preface.</hi> And for his <hi>proof</hi> of the
supposed <hi>Preterition,</hi> if it is any at all, it is but this, <hi>That
God was not a debtor to any of them,</hi> who were thus left to
<hi>Damnation</hi> in <hi>Adams Loins.</hi> Which at its utmost Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath but the force of another <hi>may-be.</hi> And is this a
<hi>strong Argument</hi> [God <hi>did</hi> leave some lapsed men in
<hi>massâ,</hi> because he <hi>might,</hi> without doing them any <hi>wrong?]</hi>
How much more <hi>rationally</hi> may it be argued even the
<hi>same irrational way</hi> (I mean by a <hi>may-be, <hi>à potentiâ ad
actum,)</hi>
                     </hi> God did <hi>not leave any</hi> by an absolute preterition <hi>in
massâ,</hi> because he <hi>might</hi> give Christ for <hi>all</hi> that <hi>Masse,</hi> and
<hi>might</hi> shew mercy to <hi>all</hi> then lying in <hi>Adams Loins,</hi> without
doing <hi>wrong</hi> to any <hi>vessel</hi> of <hi>Election,</hi> whose <hi>Eye,</hi> ought

as he did <hi>his,</hi> was more likely to shew mercy upon <hi>all</hi> that

<hi>Mercy,</hi> which importeth much <hi>more</hi> then the doing <hi>no

his works, but over <hi>all</hi> without <hi>exception.</hi> Which how

Assailant in this place must either contradict <hi>David,</hi> by <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying</hi>
that Gods <hi>Mercy is over all his works,</hi> or say with
Dr. <hi>Twisse,</hi> that <hi>it is better to be miserable for ever,</hi> than <hi>not

been spoken to, yet here my Assailant is to be <hi>thank't</hi>
for saying so plainly, and expresly, <hi>[That men do fall into
Damnation, as they themselves know, by their own wills, and
whereof themselves are the alone Causes and Authors]</hi> For if
this is <hi>heartily acknowledged</hi> (as here it is very <hi>plainly)</hi> Then
1. Farewell to <hi>Austin's rigid sentence</hi> pronounced upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <hi>baptized
Infants;</hi> for the <hi>Infants</hi> fall not by their <hi>own wills,</hi>
or against the <hi>light</hi> of their <hi>understandings,</hi> they having no
<hi>use</hi> of either <hi>faculty.</hi> 2. Farewell all consideration of <hi>Adams:
sin</hi> in the <hi>Damnation</hi> of any <hi>Creature;</hi> for they that are <hi>dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned</hi>
(saith my Assailant) are the <hi>alone Causes and Authors of
their Damnation;</hi> and if so, then was <hi>Adam</hi> no <hi>part</hi> of the
<hi>Cause</hi> or <hi>Author.</hi> If I had said thus much, how many times
had I been called a <hi>Semipelagian?</hi> and of what <hi>Correptory
Correction</hi> had I been thought <hi>worthy?</hi> But now 3. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
to all that is said by Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> against the <hi>second Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
of my <hi>Notes.</hi> For I had said only that <hi>man is the sole
efficient Cause,</hi> and explain'd my self sufficiently by saying
that <hi>Satan</hi> and the <hi>Protoplast were Promoters of my Guilt</hi>
(p. 6.) But my <hi>Assailant</hi> saith farther, that <hi>mans own will is
the alone</hi> Cause, aud the <hi>alone</hi> Author of his <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</hi>
Which gives me occasion to <hi>admire,</hi> how M. <hi>Barlee</hi>
could read this passage in his <hi>worthiest Friend,</hi> and raile so
vehemently against it, as to say <hi>it</hi>

Again I admire, how D. <hi>Reynolds</hi> could read all that <hi>bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terness</hi>

yet <hi>retain</hi> this <hi>proposition</hi> which is there so <hi>rai'ld at;</hi> yea and
how he could <hi>commend</hi> his <hi>Reviler's work</hi> for an <hi>Elaborate
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:100717:67"/>
and learned</hi> Thing. Nor is the wonder lessened, in that the
<hi>ill language</hi> of <hi>all</hi> those <hi>pages</hi> is directed to <hi>me</hi> by <hi>name,</hi> and
not to D. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> since the <hi>Doctrine against which</hi> the <hi>ill
language</hi> is levell'd, is delivered by D. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> as well as
by <hi>me,</hi> nay, by D. <hi>Reynolds after</hi> me, nay, by D. <hi>Reynolds</hi> in
<hi>defense</hi> of <hi>me</hi> even in <hi>that Epistle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> which was intended <hi>against</hi>
me in <hi>partiality</hi> to Mr. <hi>Barlee,</hi> nay, by D. <hi>Reynolds</hi> more
<hi>obnoxiously</hi> and more <hi>unwarily</hi> then by <hi>me,</hi> nay, more like
<hi>Massilian</hi> and <hi>Pelagian</hi> by D. <hi>Reynolds</hi> then by <hi>me.</hi> Let
<hi>both</hi> our words be <hi>considered,</hi> and I do seriously believe, that
he <hi>himself</hi> will say as <hi>much.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§. 4. What is added in the <hi>position</hi> concerning God's
<hi>Permission and gubernation</hi> &amp;c. is <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> as to <hi>me,</hi>
and cannot with any the least <hi>colour</hi> be fitly <hi>aimed</hi> against
<hi>my words,</hi> who said as much in my <hi>Notes</hi> (§. 12.) But only

doth here <hi>mean</hi> no more then he <hi>speaks,</hi> not conceiving
that God's <hi>will</hi> of permitting sin is <hi>efficacious,</hi> nor that he
doth <hi>impel</hi> men to any thing that is <hi>unlawful,</hi> nor that he

may still be <hi>blasphemous</hi> by his free leave; and I
shall once more <hi>thank</hi> him for having thus <hi>joyned</hi> with me
against the <hi>Correptory Corrector.</hi> And since he professeth
to <hi>be sorry</hi> for having been <hi>led so far in another mans proper
work,</hi> I will have so <hi>fair an opinion</hi> of him as to <hi>believe,</hi>
that from this time forward, he will express his <hi>sorrow</hi> by

Why not St. <hi>Iames?</hi> Chap. 1. 13, 14, 15, 17. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
why not <hi>every man,</hi> or <hi>no</hi> man at all? For is there any
thing more <hi>obvious</hi> in the very writings of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> or
in the <hi>Hearts</hi> and <hi>Mouths</hi> of <hi>all</hi> who are not quite <hi>inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi>
then that <hi>all our good things are from the Fountain of
goodness,</hi> that is, <hi>from God, and all our evils from their
Fountain</hi> too, that is, our <hi>own corrupt wills</hi> consenting to
the temptations of the <hi>world,</hi> the <hi>flesh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil?</hi>
These are such <hi>known</hi> and <hi>vulgar Truths,</hi> that they might
have been expected from any <hi>A. B. C. darian,</hi> who is but a
little <hi>catechized</hi> in the <hi>Elements</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
to a <hi>Bradwardin,</hi> and then perhaps much <hi>less</hi> to a
Dr. <hi>Iackson.</hi> That <hi>Cassianus</hi> did use that <hi>Method,</hi> as well
as <hi>Bradwardin,</hi> is as much to <hi>Bradwardin's</hi> prejudice, as
it can be to mine; although it <hi>ought not</hi> to be to <hi>either.</hi> For
<hi>Cassianus</hi> was a <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>pious</hi> man; and so commended
even by <hi>Prosper</hi> who writ <hi>against</hi> him, and who calls him
somewhere <hi>Virum divinum;</hi> though I can now as <hi>little</hi> finde
out the place <hi>where,</hi> as I can finde out that <hi>speech</hi> in his
14th. <hi>Chapter,</hi> to which by the <hi>Margin</hi> of my Assailant
I am directed. The worst that can be said of <hi>Cassianus,</hi> is,
that being a <hi>Semipelagian</hi> he <hi>erred</hi> on the <hi>right hand;</hi> which
however to be misliked, is yet exceedingly <hi>preferrable</hi> to

learned writer, who once drew the diverse opinions
touching these controversies into Tables, speaketh
of Dr. <hi>Overal's</hi> judgement, but maketh no mention

do not give any account of this paper to the

§. 2. To the Arguments which he useth against the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticalness</hi>
of that <hi>Piece</hi> which I <hi>delighted</hi> to make use of
in my <hi>Notes on God's Decrees,</hi> I have several things to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
him by way of <hi>Answer.</hi> 1. Dr. <hi>Sandersons</hi> making
<hi>no mention</hi> of it is but a <hi>negative Argument,</hi> and therefore
signifies very <hi>little</hi> to an <hi>intelligent</hi> Reader. 2. Nor can he
possibly be ignorant, that Dr. <hi>Sanderson's Tables</hi> were quite
<hi>finished</hi> before this piece of B. <hi>Andrews</hi> was sent forth into
the <hi>light.</hi> But how can any man expect, that he should
<hi>mention</hi> a writing, which he had not <hi>then</hi> the opportunity
of <hi>seeing?</hi> Or if he had, could he be thought to <hi>mention
All</hi> he ever <hi>saw?</hi> He had reason to mention the famous
Opinion of Bp. <hi>Overal,</hi> because it had something <hi>peculiar</hi>
which made it <hi>famous;</hi> and if he thought he had not the
same reasons to mention that of Bp. <hi>Andrews,</hi> how can <hi>He</hi>
or <hi>I help it?</hi> 3. There was something else which the <hi>two
Prelates</hi> did very <hi>willingly suppress,</hi> as his <hi>pattern of Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chistical
Doctrine,</hi> which yet my Rd. <hi>Assailant</hi> will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
to have been <hi>his,</hi> because it was not publisht by <hi>special
order.</hi> But 4. There was some reason for the suppression
of <hi>this,</hi> as well as <hi>that.</hi> Not because <hi>this</hi> was the issue of
his <hi>Youth,</hi> as well as <hi>that,</hi> (for <hi>this</hi> he did in his <hi>riper years)</hi>
but because they published his <hi>Opuscula</hi> much about <hi>that
Time,</hi> when the <hi>publick Discussion</hi> of these <hi>Points</hi> were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdicted
by <hi>special order,</hi> and because <hi>this Piece</hi> was not so
<hi>polished</hi> by its <hi>Author,</hi> as the other things in that <hi>Volume,</hi>
which they committed to the <hi>Press.</hi> 5. Nor ought it more to
be <hi>censured</hi> for being found in the <hi>Company</hi> of <hi>Fur Praedesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus,</hi>
then <hi>Fur Predestinatus</hi> ought to be <hi>censur'd</hi> for being
the <hi>Title of a Book,</hi> or for being found in the <hi>company</hi> of the
<hi>Articuli Lambethani.</hi> They say that <hi>Fur Praedestinatus</hi> is an
<hi>ingenious Dialogue,</hi> which hath nothing of ill in it, except the
Doctrines of those Men who help't the <hi>Thief</hi> to <hi>presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
in lieu of <hi>Faith.</hi> And those are there mention'd for
<hi>righteous ends;</hi> viz. by way of <hi>prevention</hi> to <hi>one sort</hi> of <hi>Readers,</hi> and by way of <hi>Remedy</hi> to <hi>another:</hi> that some may
be <hi>afraid</hi> of <hi>entertaining</hi> such Doctrines, and that others
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100717:71"/>
may be <hi>ashamed</hi> of having <hi>taught</hi> them. 6. As it hath
hitherto appeared, that there is not any <hi>force</hi> in any <hi>one</hi> of
<hi>those reasons,</hi> which would not have men believe that that
small piece is Bp. <hi>Andrews</hi>'s, so there are <hi>reasons</hi> for the
<hi>contrary</hi> of force sufficient. For 1. The <hi>language</hi> and the
<hi>frame,</hi> and the inward <hi>spirit</hi> of the thing, do partly tell us
that it is <hi>His,</hi> who may be <hi>guest</hi> at by his <hi>finger,</hi> as well as
<hi>Hercules</hi> by his <hi>Foot. 2. Part</hi> of it is discernable even in
some of those <hi>Sermons,</hi> whose publication was referred to
the <hi>Bishops</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> and of <hi>Ely,</hi> except that the <hi>one</hi> hath
it in <hi>Latin,</hi> as the <hi>other</hi> in <hi>English.</hi> 3. The Publisher of it,
<hi>F. G.</hi> (if I rightly guess at him) is both a learned and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man, whose <hi>Integrity</hi> would not suffer him to put a
<hi>deceipt</hi> upon the Reader, especially in a matter where there
could not accrue to him the least <hi>advantage</hi> or <hi>convenience.</hi>
For 7. That that inestimable Bp. was, (in his most <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>
and <hi>ripest years)</hi> very <hi>severe</hi> to those <hi>Doctrines</hi> which
are commonly called <hi>Calvinistical,</hi> is a thing so <hi>known,</hi> that
I cannot think it will be <hi>denied. Nulli nota magis domus
est sua.</hi>—His solemn <hi>Sermons</hi> at the <hi>Court</hi> do often
declare him to be <hi>that,</hi> which the <hi>Ignorant</hi> and <hi>the Passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
will call Arminian</hi> Of which I do not torment my
Reader with <hi>Examples,</hi> because I imagin, there cannot be
the least need. But if my Rd. <hi>Assailant</hi> will have me, I
will do it as soon as I know his <hi>Pleasure.</hi> At present I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten

                  <p>§. 1. HERE is a palpable <hi>confession,</hi> that the <hi>onely
thing</hi> which was <hi>desired,</hi> is the <hi>last</hi> and <hi>least</hi>
thing by him <hi>perform'd.</hi> Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> courted his opinion
concerning his <hi>Correptory Correction,</hi> and in the room of
<hi>that,</hi> he hath told him his opinion of <hi>other things.</hi> I did
<hi>never</hi> desire him to give me his <hi>opinion</hi> upon the reading of
my <hi>Notes,</hi> nor did I expect that he should <hi>read</hi> them, much
<hi>less</hi> did I desire him to <hi>declare</hi> his <hi>opinion</hi> to <hi>all</hi> the <hi>world,</hi>
much <hi>less</hi> to declare it as much as <hi>might</hi> be to my <hi>discredit,</hi>
much <hi>less</hi> to the <hi>discredit</hi> of Bp. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and the <hi>Doctrines</hi>
by <hi>Him</hi> espoused; yet he hath turned over his Books, and
made a <hi>muster</hi> of <hi>Citations,</hi> and spent <hi>almost</hi> his <hi>whole Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi>
in that which did not <hi>belong</hi> unto him, nor was at all
<hi>desired</hi> of him, either by <hi>me,</hi> or my <hi>angry Neighbour.</hi>
Which <hi>why</hi> should he do, if he had not a willingnefs to
<hi>own</hi> his <hi>Cause,</hi> to <hi>gratifie</hi> his <hi>Party,</hi> to <hi>abett</hi> his <hi>Fellow
Labourer,</hi> to <hi>shew</hi> his <hi>strength,</hi> and to <hi>challenge me</hi> to an
<hi>Encounter?</hi> I have <hi>answered</hi> his <hi>Challenge</hi> so much the rather,
because I think him one of the <hi>ablest</hi> of those that <hi>erre</hi> on
that <hi>side,</hi> and in the <hi>conversion</hi> or <hi>confutation</hi> of whom, the
greatest <hi>good</hi> is to be done to them that read us; I had also
more <hi>respect</hi> for a person of his <hi>Fame,</hi> then to <hi>affront</hi> him
with a <hi>contemptuous silence;</hi> and a greater <hi>care</hi> of his <hi>Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxie,</hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>en to suffer him to live in such a dangerous <hi>mistake,</hi>
as to believe his Epistle <hi>unanswerable</hi> in case it were <hi>unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</hi>
For as soon as he had <hi>wished, and wished heartily,
that there might be no further reciprocation of the law of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,</hi>
he immediately added, <hi>[but that truth might so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail</hi>
&amp;c.] Upon which I considered within my self, that if
I had not made him some <hi>return</hi> to his <hi>Assault,</hi> he might
have imagin'd, that <hi>Truth</hi> had been on <hi>his side,</hi> and have
ascribed <hi>both</hi> the <hi>patience,</hi> and the <hi>modesty</hi> of my <hi>silence,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>prevalence</hi> of that which he is pleased to call <hi>Truth.</hi>
                     <pb n="128" facs="tcp:100717:73"/>
Let this suffice for his confessed <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>§. 2. Secondly, He next goes on to encourage his <hi>Fellow-Labourer</hi>
with some <hi>applause</hi> and <hi>commendation,</hi> which his
<hi>Fellow-Labourer</hi> had <hi>earned</hi> of him by quoting a passage of
his <hi>Sermon</hi> preached before the <hi>Lord Maior,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Correp. Cor. p. 35.</note> taking that
occasion to call him <hi>the Eminent and sweet</hi> Dr. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.
First, he commends the <hi>Theological</hi> and <hi>argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
parts</hi> of his Book, (which he did well to distinguish
from the <hi>scurrilous and Invective,)</hi> as very <hi>acceptable to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
learned men, and very useful to the Church of God.</hi> How
directly contrary this is to the real merit of the thing, I
have partly shewed already, and can do in greater abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
when my Rd. <hi>Assailant</hi> shall call me to it. If to teach
a <hi>wicked</hi> world, that <hi>God doth tempt men unto sin,</hi> that he
<hi>praedestins,</hi> and <hi>stirrs them up</hi> to that which is <hi>unlawful,</hi> that
his <hi>will and Decree of mens sins is efficacious and absolute,</hi>
if not a few, but a <hi>multitude</hi> of such like Doctrines, (which
have made so many <hi>Ranters</hi> and <hi>Libertines</hi> in <hi>Christendom,</hi>
to the great <hi>scandal</hi> of the <hi>heathen</hi> and the <hi>dishonour of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity)</hi>
is <hi>acceptable to the learned,</hi> or <hi>useful to the Church,</hi>
then the <hi>Correptory Corrector</hi> hath highly deserved his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations.
And let that suffice for a <hi>specimen</hi> of his
<hi>Theological</hi> performances, which if I listed to pursue in all
the particulars that I have noted, they would make a <hi>new
Volume</hi> with too much <hi>ease.</hi> Of his <hi>argumentative</hi> faculty
(which is the second thing commended) I will also give no
more then one or two <hi>Tasts.</hi> It being a part of his <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ologie,</hi>
that though a <hi>Saint</hi> may be guilty both of <hi>

is of his <hi>judgment</hi> in this particular, yet that is his first
proof, the <hi>Concession of Bertius.</hi> Secondly, he adds his
<hi>misapprehension</hi> and strange <hi>abuse</hi> of that Text of Scripture
<hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 11, which, every <hi>childe</hi> knows, was penn'd by <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
after</hi> the time of his <hi>Repentance.</hi> Thirdly, he adds,
that if <hi>this had not been true</hi> (which was said by <hi>him</hi> and
<hi>Bertius) David after his fall must have been circumcised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,</hi>
and (to give the <hi>Anabaptists</hi> as much advantage as he

Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> affirmeth me to have said, <hi>That no man is elected</hi>

it from its <hi>execution,</hi> I could have placed the <hi>Decree</hi>

<hi>Grace</hi> as to <hi>invent</hi> such a Calumny, had withall so little wit
as to cite my 69 <hi>page,</hi> as the place where he <hi>pretends</hi> that I

had spoken <hi>those words;</hi> that so every Reader who will

                  <p>§ 3. He is next commended by his <hi>Encomiast,</hi> for <hi>having
conversed with Dr. Twisse, that second Bradwardine, unto
very good purpose.</hi> Which is as much as to say, that he
hath shewed himself able to <hi>write and read.</hi> For all the
use he hath made of Dr. <hi>Twisse,</hi> is to transcribe a <hi>great
deal of him,</hi> sometimes nothing to his <hi>purpose,</hi> sometimes
<hi>against it.</hi> Indeed Dr. <hi>Twisse</hi> was as great an enemy to their
<hi>way,</hi> and difputed against it as <hi>earnestly,</hi> as either of them
can dispute against <hi>me.</hi> And the more they <hi>commend</hi> him
as a <hi>second Bradwardine,</hi> an <hi>eminent servant of Christ,</hi>
and the like, the more they do implicitly <hi>condemn</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Mr. <hi>B.</hi> hath done him the <hi>dishonour</hi> to speak <hi>well</hi> of
him, to talk much of his <hi>Friendship,</hi> and to pretend that
he <hi>loved him as another Timothy.</hi> No doubt he may have
seen the Doctors <hi>face,</hi> which he describes to have been
<hi>stern,</hi> p. 64.) but sure I am, he knowes but little of his
<hi>meaning,</hi> more then what I have <hi>shew'd</hi> him, upon occasion
of his <hi>mistakes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Reverend Adversary concludes with a <hi>hearty wish,</hi>
that <hi>contention</hi> may <hi>cease,</hi> and <hi>Polemical writings be out of
Date, that the Lord may be one and his name one</hi> (as the
<hi>Scotsmen</hi> concluded the <hi>second Article</hi> of the <hi>Covenant.)</hi> But
how <hi>heartily</hi> he <hi>wish'd</hi> it, and how much he hath contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the <hi>accomplishment</hi> of his <hi>wish,</hi> the Reader may easily
passe a judgment, 1. by his <hi>medling</hi> in this matter of his
<hi>own accord,</hi> confessedly <hi>beyond</hi> what was <hi>desired by</hi> Mr. <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee;</hi>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:100717:75"/>
2. by his <hi>assaulting</hi> of <hi>me</hi> who never gave him the <hi>least
degree</hi> of <hi>provocation;</hi> 3. by telling a <hi>Correptory Corrector</hi>
(who needed a <hi>bridle</hi> and not a <hi>spur)</hi> that though <hi>soft
words and hard Arguments are best, yet in writings of this
Nature there may be a necessity of sharp Rebukes;</hi> 4. by <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
a Text of Scripture (qua si obtorto collo)</hi> to help to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse</hi>
the <hi>sharpness</hi> of a <hi>book,</hi> of which the <hi>common voice</hi> is,
that it is perfectly <hi>unexcusable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 4. I will also conclude with a <hi>hearty wish,</hi> (and which
I verily believe is <hi>sincerely such)</hi> That we who are <hi>diverse</hi>
at <hi>present,</hi> may after some short time be <hi>One</hi> in <hi>Iudgment;</hi>
Or if our <hi>Heads</hi> cannot be brought to an agreement, yet
at least that God's Grace may be so <hi>prevalent</hi> in our <hi>Hearts,</hi>
that whilst we are <hi>diverse</hi> in <hi>Iudgment,</hi> we may be <hi>One</hi> in
<hi>Love.</hi> That all the <hi>Hottest</hi> of our <hi>Contentions</hi> may be in
order to <hi>conviction;</hi> and to the conviction of the <hi>Gainsay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi>
not by the <hi>ruine</hi> of his <hi>Person,</hi> but of his <hi>Argument</hi>
and his <hi>Cause.</hi> Yet because there is an <hi>usual</hi> and <hi>easie</hi> pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage,
from <hi>breach</hi> of <hi>judgement,</hi> to <hi>breach</hi> of <hi>Charity,</hi> And
because <hi>Agreement</hi> in <hi>Error</hi> is the <hi>sinew</hi> of <hi>Faction,</hi> but
not of <hi>Peace;</hi> it concern's us to <hi>pray</hi> that we may <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour,</hi>
and to <hi>endeavour</hi> sincerely whilst we pray,
That <hi>Truth</hi> as well as <hi>Vnity,</hi> and <hi>Vnity</hi> in the <hi>Truth,</hi>
may be the only <hi>scope</hi> first, and then the only <hi>conclusion</hi>
of our <hi>Debates.</hi> Were this obtained in <hi>Disputations,</hi> we
should not finally <hi>change weapons,</hi> and passe <hi>à calamo ad
gladium.</hi> We should persecute the <hi>Syllogisme,</hi> but not
the <hi>Man;</hi> destroy his <hi>Error,</hi> but not his <hi>Family,</hi> or his
<hi>Fortune.</hi> In the mean time it were well, if we would
not think it a <hi>noble Constancy</hi> to <hi>persevere</hi> in that <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
which first <hi>be speak's</hi> us, nor <hi>blush</hi> at the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing</hi>
our former <hi>Errors,</hi> as soon as we <hi>see,</hi> and <hi>dislike</hi>
