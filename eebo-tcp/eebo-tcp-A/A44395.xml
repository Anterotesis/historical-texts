         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>MY business is now effected by your L. care to my contentment,
since the first day of my coming to Dort, they have made
me an allowance equal with our English Divines, which is
20 Florens a day; a less allowance might very well have
served me, if I had not been joyned with them, but being
joyned, it was not fit that for matter of maintenance I
should be in their debts: I am exceedingly beholden to Mr. <hi>Musius</hi> his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
not only upon this, but upon all occasions: It doth proceed I suppose
from your L. to whom as I must ever stand bound for the return of perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
thanks and service, so I would be a suiter to your L. that your L. would
be pleased to give Mr. <hi>Musius</hi> thanks for his kindness: For our Synod busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
as we went too slow before, so now they would have us go too fast,
they would have us to dispatch one article a week; which is too little time for
so weighty questions. But I hope they shall be done to some purpose: with
the remembrance of my faithfullest duty and service to your L. and your
worthy Lady, and my best wishes for both your health and happiness, I take

                        </gap> Session;
in which nothing was done, but that they which before had not spoken in
the second article did speak what they thought fit, there was nothing of note
spoken, save that one of the <hi>Transisulani,</hi> took it evil that we took the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114807:4"/>
Remonstrants meaning in their opinions, where they spake best and sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est;
but he would have their meaning to be gathered out of all places in their
Books, where they speak most absurdly, which we thought was very far besides
the rule of charity: so in that Session the Synodical diquisition for the second
article was ended. The President told us moreover, that the Delegats had
sent to the Remonstrants, and had demanded of them if they had any thing
in writ which might serve for the explication of their opinion concerning
the five articles; and that they had given to them, their confirmation of
their opinion concerning the first article, as likeways a confutation of that
which they held for the Heterodox opinion, and a beginning of their explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the second article: now he shewed us the Book, of which is good
faith I was ashamed to think that men of judgement could imagine that the
Synod could have time to peruse it; for it is a little book of Martyrs, it
doth exceed two hundreth <hi>folia</hi> in <hi>folio;</hi> moreover he told us that the Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats
had commanded them within 8. dayes to bring in all they would or
could say as necessary for the understanding of their minde concerning the
whole five articles. On the 8. of <hi>February Stylo Novo,</hi> was held the 77<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> which was nothing done but that the President did dictate to us,
these drawn out of the Remonstrants writings concerning the 3. and 4. articles,
which I hold not expedient to send to your L. but if I shal understand that your
L. do desire them, I can easily send them: It was appointed we should this
morning send our Amanuenses to write out so much of the Remonstrants big
Book as did concern the second article, which we did, and that again Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
we should consult what we should have done with the great volumn it
self; this day the President sent to our particular Colledge, some particular
strange points which he had drawn out of their late explication of the second
article, and in very pathetical terms did by his letter entreat us to have a care
of condemning them in our judgement of the same article. Concerning this
second article I beseech your L. give me leave to express my grief, as there is
difference touching it in the Synod, so there is much difference about it in our
own Colledge: will your L. be pleased to give me leave to say something of
it; it is fit your L. should take notice of it, but no wayes as from me; the
question amongst us is whether the words of the Scripture, which are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the words of our confession. <hi>Christus oblatus est aut mortuus pro toto huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no
genere seu pro peccatis totius mundi) be to be understood of all particular men,
or only of the elect who consist of all sorts of men; Dr.</hi> Davenant <hi>and Dr.</hi> Ward
<hi>are of</hi> Martinius <hi>of Breme his minde, that it is to be understood of all particular
men:</hi> the other three take the other exposition, which is of the writers of
the reformed Churches, and namely of my late Lord of <hi>Sarisbury,</hi> both sides
think they are right, and therefore cannot yield one untoanother with a safe
conscience: It is my Lord a matter of great consequence for us to set down
the exposition of one article of our Church confession: will your L. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114807:4"/>
be pleased to think of this proposition: since our judgement of none of
the five articles is to be known, till we have done with them all; what if we
should desire the President to take no notice, but to let us go on to the rest of
the articles, and in mean time we should send into <hi>England</hi> the true state of
our controversie, and have advice there from some of the chief of the Church.
What exposition they would have to be given of that article of their confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which we may safely follow, for it is no matter of salvation in which we
differ, before we have done with the rest of the articles we may easily have
one answer from <hi>England;</hi> if your L. like this motion or any other, your L.
should do well by your letters to us to desire it, if not; I beseech your L.
pardon my error which proceedeth only from my fear of distraction among
our selves, and from my obedience to his Majesties charge, who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
me in all such cases to have recourse to your L. for counsel: so with my
best prayers to God for your L. health and happiness, with the remembrance
of my best service to your L. and your worthy Lady, I take my leave and rest.</p>

upon some propositions, which are without question true, but they
were such as did no ways decide the question controverted in the Synod; we
retained the words of Scripture and our own confessions, but all the difference
is in the interpretation of these words. When the Canons of the second ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle

mundi,</hi> I dare engage my credit with your L. that it is truly set down,
and more fully then in our Letters to my L. Grace; your L. may take so much
of it as you shall think fit, and make his Grace acquainted with it; and write
that this is like to be the difference not in (as your L. is informed) our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but in the Synod about the second article, and therefore desire his
Grace to send us some good counsel for our carriage in it; <hi>for certainly most
voices in the Synod will follow the receaved exposition of the reformed Doctors, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
much by my late L. of Sarisbury his G. brother, who was thought to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the meaning of our confession as well as any man.</hi> I doubt not but that
your L. will crown your own work with following of it; when your L. shall
find the fruit of peace in the Synod among us procured by your L. your L.
will finde great matter of joy, arising from the conscience of this Christian
counsel; our controversie among our selves, I must needs say, was with
much love and amitie, no man desiring any thing to be put in our articles, but
that we should all approve of; but so the question had never been decided:
I beseech your L. pardon this my libertie to your L. it is the love of peace, and
my respect to your L. Honour doth procure it.</p>

                        </gap> first the 78. Ses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
held on the 2. <hi>February Novo Stylo,</hi> in which Dr. <hi>Beckins</hi> one of the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetian
Devines at the President his intreaty did publickly discusse the 7. argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Remonstrants in <hi>Collat. Hag.</hi> whereby they prove <hi>Gratiam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generationis
esse resistibilem.</hi> That being done al auditors were removed, and
it was inquired what order the Synod thought fittest to be taken with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants
huge volume, the transcription whereof was impossible, the
President told us he had cast a general glance over it all, and did finde that a
few of the first leaves did contain a confirmation of their opinion of the first
article, but all the rest did contain nothing but a confutation of the <hi>contra</hi> R.
opinion, and an exagitation of their persons: we desired some part of it to
be read; <hi>I must needs say the Remonstrants had no favour, for I will assure your
L. that the President picked out the worst part of it; there were some five leaves
read, which contained nothing but a bitter Satyr against Calvin, Beza, Pareus,
Piscator, Whittaker, Perkins, Bogorman, Festus, and twenty more,</hi> but in
truth <hi>though unhappily,</hi> yet <hi>finely penned,</hi> me thought it was <hi>Episcopius</hi> his
tongue; about the taking notice of this book the suffrages of the Synod did
varie much; yet most voices were, that it should be committed to some De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
by the Synod, who should diligently peruse it, and relate unto the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
if they found any new thing in it, which was not contained in their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
writings, but yet so that any member of the Synod that would, might be
present with the perusers. The Delegats gave this mediatory sentence, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they had observed that both the parts of it were desired by many:
they desired their might be a forenoon Session or two kept for the nonce, in
which that small part of the book which contained the confirmation of their
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114807:5"/>
opinion might be read, and every man take with his pen, what he should
think fit, the rest to be put over to perusers, who should make relation to the
Synod of any thing they found new or fit: and therefore the Assessors; and
D. <hi>Damannus</hi> the Scribe were entreated to run over the book, &amp; make choice
of what things they thought fit to be read in the Synod, which when they
have done we shall hear more of it.</p>
                     <p>The president telleth us that the campenses Remonstrants, who had been
lately peremptorily cited to compeire before the Synod were not come, but
that they had sent three others in their place to plead their cause: and that he
had likewise received a supplication to the Synod from the <hi>Campenses contra-Remonst.</hi>
The Synod referred the hearing of the whole cause to deputies,
one out of every Colledge.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sessio</hi> 79. 12. <hi>Feb.</hi>] The Synodical disquisition concerning the third and
fourth article began, many Devines spake divers things, the disquisition came
down to D. <hi>Crocius</hi> of <hi>Breme,</hi> and so the Synod was dimissed.</p>

                        <hi>Sessio</hi> 82. 12. <hi>Feb.</hi>] We went on in the Synodical disquisition of the third
and fourth article, where many men spake their opinions freely, when it came
to <hi>Sibrandus</hi> he spake at least an houre, in his speech he took exceptions at
some things that D. <hi>Martinius</hi> of <hi>Breme</hi> had spoken the day before, especially
that he had said <hi>God was causa physica conversionis;</hi> he delivered some reasons
against it, and desired <hi>Martinius</hi> to give satisfaction to them, and to instruct
him in that which he knew not before; <hi>Martinius</hi> answered for himself, but
between them both there were more words then sense, <hi>for they made it a meer
Phylosophical speculation, like to keeping a phylosophie act, much against the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of questions to be discussed in a Synod: Martinius</hi> for the truth of his asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
appealed to <hi>Goclenius</hi> their present, as being <hi>princeps philosophorum,</hi> who
were not wont to be appealed to in Synodical questions, and <hi>Goclenius</hi> took
the moderator his place bravely upon him; told us that <hi>Themistius, Averores,
Alexander Aphrodisaeus,</hi> and many more were of <hi>Martinius</hi> his opinion;
and his opinion true in Philosophy, but yet he would not have it to prescribe
in Divinity; <hi>Sibrandus</hi> fell upon <hi>Goclenius</hi> too, so after many words lost on
all sides, the President cut them off, and so that act ended, and so the disqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
ended: yesterday we had no Session, this day we have one, of which
your L. by God his grace shall be advertised in my next. So with the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of my best service to your L. and your vertuous Lady I rest.</p>

                        <hi>Sessio</hi> 81. 13. <hi>Feb. Stylo Novo.</hi>] Credential letters were read from the
<hi>Frisians,</hi> by which <hi>Dacon ab Aisma,</hi> was deputed in the Colledge of the <hi>Frisians</hi>
as a member of the Synod in the place of <hi>Meinhardus</hi> a <hi>senior Ecelesiae Leowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densis,</hi>
who lately died here; he took the <hi>oath</hi> of the Synod, &amp; so was admitted.
<hi>Alstedius</hi> the only Nassovical Devine now left, by appointment of the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
publickly all auditors being admitted, did vindicate the 10. argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which the <hi>Contra</hi>-Remonstrants used in <hi>Collat. Hag.</hi> for proving of ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistibility
of grace, from the objections, exceptions, and instances of the
Remonstrants: and so the auditory was dismissed. The President giveth us
warning, that on munday at 9. of the clock there should be a Session, in
which they would begin to read the great volume of the Remonstrants, lately
given in; and telleth us moreover, that now they had given in their explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114807:6"/>
of the 3. 4. and 5. articles, but no confirmation of them: yet that the
Delegats had commanded them within eight days to bring in all they would
or could say concerning the five articles. Because the two <hi>Campenses</hi> Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants
being peremptorily cited had not compeired, the President desired the
Synod to think of some fit punishment for this their contumacie. First we
read letters from <hi>Fosculius,</hi> one of these two Remonstrants; in which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuseth
his absence by these three reasons: first, that the Church could not
bear their absence; because if they should both come, there was none to
preach: not that he himself was making ready for the journey, but that he
was stopped, by the tears, howlings, sighs, outcries, lamentations, and
prayers of all sexes, and ages, and conditions of people, boyes, girls, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,
servants, mistresses, and maids, young and old, and many more such
specifications there were; thirdly, that they had sent two to the Synod to
answer for them; and therefore do humbly intreat, that they by these their
procurators may <hi>causam dicere:</hi> after these were read other latine let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from the Seniors of that same Church, wonderful long, but so extreamly
foolish and idle, that one might see they were written by some indiscreet
pedant, who had run himself out of breath with trotting through all the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pick
places of school boyes rhetorick; they contained in them the same reasons
for their ministers none-comparence, which the former: and moreover did
protest that their ministers were ready for their journey, but that the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
of their roarings, houlings, hindred them: and therefore in a most fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
strain did desire the Synod to conceit with themselves, that they did but
now with their eyes behold this ruthful spectacle: to wit, The whole city
of <hi>Camps</hi> male and female, young and old lying before them, tearing their
hair, knocking their breasts, piercing the ayre with their sighs, and heaven
with their lamentable howlings, having their eyes sunk in their heads with
tears, and their hearts ready to burst out at their sides for anguish; with such
a deal of female foolish Rhetorick, as no masculine pen can relate, they desire
the non-comparence of their Pastors; of whose doctrines they might take
sufficient notice without their personal presence, since it was the same which
the Remonstrants had maintained in <hi>Collat. Hag.</hi> It is to be noted that the
Magistrates of <hi>Camps,</hi> who before had written in these <hi>citati</hi> favour, did not
now write.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, there was read the <hi>contra</hi>-Remonstrants <hi>campenses,</hi> who were
come to accuse the <hi>citati,</hi> answer to the reasons contained in the <hi>citati</hi> let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
to the first: that the Church could not want their presence, it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered;
that the <hi>Classis Campensis</hi> would look to that, as other classes now did
to the charges of all the rest, who were present at the Synod; besides that no
mans charge in private can excuse him for non-comparence before a judge,
when he is cited. To the second, that they were coming, but were hindred
by the people, it was answered that a seditious tumultuary concourse of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114807:7"/>
ought not to hinder any man from comparence before a judge, especially
since it is known that this seditious conflux was procured by the <hi>citati,</hi> as is
evident by the confessions of many, (whose names were there expressed,)
who being called to be present at that tumultuary assembly refused; who did
testifie moreover, that the <hi>citati</hi> went about begging hands to subscribe these
foolish letters to the Synod. To the third, that they had sent procurators
to answer for them; it was answered, that it was a thing not heard of, that
another man should give account of these things which they themselves bad
taught. These things being read, the Synod was required to give sentence:
the Delegats sentence was this: that notwithstanding all these idle excuses the
<hi>citati</hi> were to be condemned of contumacie, to be suspended from their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery,
but with this provision, that if within fourteen days after the receipt
of new Letters from the Synod, they did personally compeire, they should be
absolved from this sentence of suspension; if they did not, this sentence
should stand firm <hi>pro nunc et tunc et omni tempore:</hi> the rest of the Synod were
entreated that again Munday they would deliberate of this business, and so
give in their judgements of it.</p>

                        <hi>Sessio</hi> 82. 18. <hi>Feb.</hi>] Their were read publickly 47. pages of the <hi>Remonst.</hi>
book; all which did contain only one answer to the first foure places produced
by the <hi>contra</hi>-Remonstrants, in <hi>collatione Hag.</hi> whereby they prove that (<hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        <hi>Sessio</hi> 83. <hi>eodem die post meridiem.</hi>] The sentence of the Synod was asked
concerning the Remonstrants <hi>Campenses,</hi> all agreed with the sentence of the
Delegats given at the end of the 81. Session: except only the Divines of <hi>Breme;</hi>
who delivered their opinion at large in writing, it was to perswade a milder
course, the reasons were many and well penned: when it came to the Colledge
of the Professors, notwithstanding that D. <hi>Polyander</hi> had delivered their col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiat
sentence; yet D. <hi>Gomarus, Martinius</hi> his professed enemy, asketh leave
to speak; and so entereth into a confutation of that which they of <hi>Breme</hi> had
delivered, so that he and <hi>Martinius</hi> fell foul in the Synod, very much against
the dignity of such an assembly. In truth I must needs say, that some of the
provincials do use <hi>Martinius</hi> very uncivily, and all the forraign Devines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to take it evil at their hands, he is a man very learned, and very honest,
sound in all the five articles, as any man in the Synod, except the Second, in
which when the Canons come to be made, your L. shall hear there will be
more of his opinion besides himself, notwithstanding of all this; because he
doth mislike many of the <hi>contra</hi>-Remonstrants broad speeches in many points,
which I think every learned and godly man will do; they use him with so
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114807:7"/>
much discourtesie, as I will assure your L. he hath been very near leaving of
the Synod, and his colleagues were half purposed to go with him, what a blow
this would give to the credit of the Synod, any man may easily perceive, the
provincials in this take not the right course. <hi>Though one be against the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants in all the five articles in substance; yet if he differ from them but in
manner of speaking, they hold him as not sound:</hi> if by your L. means the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident
were advertised of these things, it might do much good. What
farther passeth in the Synod your Lordship by God his grace shall hear, in
mean time with the remembrance of my best service to your good Lordship,
I take my leave and rest.</p>

said Articles, but <hi>Sibrandus</hi> desireth the President first to give him leave to
adde some few things to that he had spoken the day before: now what he
added was nothing but a renewing of that strife, which was between him and

been at <hi>Goolenius</hi> his lodging, conferring with him about that proposition,
whether God might be called <hi>causa physica</hi> of humane actions, and delivered
certain affirmations pronounced by <hi>Goclenius,</hi> tending to the negative, for
the truth of his relation he appealed to <hi>Goclenius</hi> there present, who testified

                        <pb n="10" facs="tcp:114807:8"/>

                        </gap>edingly grieved it should have come from a
man of so good worth. The summe of it was this, that he did know upon
his own knowledge, that <hi>Pareus</hi> did hold the contrary of that which had
been falsely fathered upon him in the Synod, that he could not endure to bear
his dearest colleague so much abused, as he had been by some men in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod;
moreover that he could not now dissemble the great grief he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
that some in the Synod went about to trouble sound divinity with
bringing in <hi>iricas Scholasticas,</hi> such as was to make God <hi>causam Physicam con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versionis;</hi>
(that was for <hi>Martinius,</hi>) such <hi>por<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

some doubts in the fourth Article, which <hi>Calvin</hi> himself had not throughly
satisfied, nor other learned reformed Doctors; that it was to be feared that
they intended to bring in Jesuits Divinity in the reformed Churches, and to
corrupt the youth committed to their charge, with a strange kinde of Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
this last speech concerned D. <hi>Crocius, Scul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

exceeding bitter and disgraceful words, and repeated his bitterest sentences
twice over: he having ended, <hi>Martinius</hi> with great modesty answered, first
that he would read <hi>Pareus</hi> his own words, which he did, next that for <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brandus,</hi>
he wondered that he would now in publick bring these things up:
since out of his love to peace, that very day he had sent his colleague <hi>Crocius</hi>
to <hi>Sibrandus,</hi> with a large explication of that sense in which he had delivered
that proposition, with which explication <hi>Sibrandus</hi> himself had sent him
word that he was fully satisfied, and so he made account that that business
had been peaceably transacted: all this while <hi>Crocius</hi> spoke nothing: <hi>Goma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
beginneth to go on in the disquisition, but I think he delivered a speech a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the <hi>Bremenses,</hi> which none but a <hi>mad man</hi> would have uttered. First,
whereas <hi>Martinius</hi> had said that he did desire the resolution of this doubt,

enough untyed that knot, he replied first, that he that had said so was not <hi>dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus
qui solveret Calvino corrigiam;</hi> and that for the doubt it self it was such a
silly one that <hi>ipsi pueri in trivio</hi> could <hi>ipsius solutionem decantare,</hi> at which
speech every body smiled, moreover whereas <hi>Martinius</hi> in his answer to

thus used for using a School term; <hi>Gomarus</hi> very wisely had a fling at that

too, and telleth the Synod that since some men thought to carry it away <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum

the Schools of the Jesuits, <hi>determinare</hi> and <hi>non determinare voluntatem,</hi> with
many such speeches, delivered with such sparkling of his eyes, and fierceness
of pronunciation, as every man wondered the President did not cut him off,
at last he cut of himself I think for want of breath, and the President giveth
<hi>Celeberrimo Doctori Gomaro</hi> many thanks for that his learned grave and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
speach; the <hi>exteri</hi> wondered at it, at last my L. of <hi>Landaffe,</hi> in good
faith in a very grave, short, sweet speech, (for which as for one of the best
I am perswaded he ever delivered, we &amp; all the <hi>Exteri</hi> thought he deserved infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
commendations: ) he spake to the President to this purpose, that this
Synodical disquisition was instituted for edification, not for any men to show
<hi>studium contentionis:</hi> and therefore did desire him to look that the knot of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
were not broken: in this his L. speech he named no man, the last word
was hardly out of my L. lips, but furious <hi>Gomarus</hi> knowing himself guilty,
delivereth this wise speech: <hi>Reverendissime D.</hi> Praesul <hi>agendum est hic in Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
non authoritate sed ratione:</hi> that it was free for him to speak in his own
place, which no man must think to abridge him of by their authority, my L.
replyed nothing; but the President told my L. that <hi>celeberrimus</hi> D. <hi>Gom.</hi> had
said nothing against mens persons, but their opinions, and therefore that he
had said nothing worthy of reprehension: this gave every man just occasion
to think the President was on the plot: <hi>Martinius</hi> against this speech of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus</hi>
said nothing, but that he was sorry that he should have this reward for
his far journey. The disquisition went on to <hi>Thysius,</hi> who very discreetly told
the Synod he was sorry <hi>Martinius</hi> should be so exagitated, for a speech which
according to <hi>Martinius</hi> his explication was true, just as <hi>Thysius</hi> was thus speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Gomarus</hi> and <hi>Sibrandus,</hi> who sate next him, pulleth him by the sleeve,
talketh to him with a confused angry noise in the hearing and seeing of all the
Synod, chiding him that he would say so; afterward <hi>Thysius</hi> with great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
desired <hi>Martinius</hi> to give him satisfaction of one or two doubtful sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
he had delivered, which <hi>Martinius</hi> thanking him for his courtesie fully
did: the President was certainly on this plot against <hi>Martinius,</hi> for at that
same time he did read out of a paper publickly a note of all the hard speeches
<hi>Martinius</hi> had used: all this while D. <hi>Crocius</hi> his patience was admired by all
men, who being so grossely abused &amp; disgraced could get leave of his affections
to hold his peace. What this is like to come to I will tell your L. after I have set

                     <p>Now my L. concerning this matter of the <hi>Bremenses,</hi> is come to this
height: that they thought to have gone home, and withal were ready to
have printed an apology for themselves, and an narration of their hard usage
in the Synod: but that some of the <hi>Exteri Theologi</hi> came to the English Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and desired them to help to quench this fire, all the <hi>Exteri</hi> take to
heart these two things, first that strangers should be used so disgracefully,
for using two School terms, which are both very common, next that <hi>Goma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
durst openly in the Synod give such an irreverend answer to my L. of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daffe,</hi>
for which unless all the <hi>exteri</hi> may have satisfaction. (Except the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latines</hi>)
I believe their will be a shameful sturre in the Synod; they desired the
English to labour the <hi>Bremenses</hi> to reconciliation with <hi>Scultetus,</hi> which this
night they are doing; what becometh of it your L. shall hear; but I have
small hope, for the <hi>Bremenses</hi> will take no satisfactiou but publick, because it
was a publick imputation upon their professions and School, as if that were
a place for corrupting of youth: and I think <hi>Scultetus</hi> will be loath to give

shall hold) to desire the Delegats to take notice of the wrong offered by <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus</hi>
to my L. of <hi>Landaffe;</hi> my Lord, all I will say is this, there are two

obliged to your L. for your Letters to the President; so full of sober, good,
and necessarie counsel, the happy fruit whereof I hope during our being there
we shall not cease to finde, as we have already begun to taste a little of the
sweetness of it; for the very next Session after the President had received
your L. letters, at the beginning in very milde and discreet words he entreated
all the members of the Synod, that in their disquisition of the fifth Article,
they should abstain from all bitterness, and personal opposition, and follow
meekness and brotherly kindness, which in that disquisition was observed by
the two Belgick professors, very strictly, and their phrase and stile tempered
otherwise then heretofore it hath been; so as one might see they had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the good counsel of your L. letters, for I will assure you they
followed it: your L. joy can not chuse but be great when you remember the
great peace procured by your L. I should hold my self an enemy to the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick,
if I should not particularly inform your L. of all the passages here,
by whom if any of them go amiss, they may so happily be corrected. The
reason why I have been so long a writing is, because I wanted news of which
our Synod now is very barren, and will be so till towards the latter end of
the next week; at which time all Colledges judgements of the five articles

of action: yet I will be bold for fashions sake to send your L. a note of such

them learned, religious, orthodoxal, were sorry they had done that which was
done, and would do so no more: the <hi>Bremenses</hi> desired that one of our Colledge
might be present at this satisfaction, but the other three would no way yield
to it. <hi>Gomarus</hi> was there admonished to repair to my L. of <hi>Landaffe,</hi> and
to testifie unto him his sorrow for the word which unawares had proceeded
from him to his L. in the Synod; but yet the old tuffe man is not come to his

set out by the states General, for restraining the printing of all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious

in this Synod, especially by the <hi>Delegats;</hi> a book made only to incite
the common people to a dislike of the Synod, they are not to be sold, but
they send them abroad among their favorites, I have all this day been using

                        <hi>Sessio</hi> 99. 4. <hi>March Stylo Novo.</hi>] The President did invite the whole Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
to the Funeral of a Helvetian Gentleman, one Mr. <hi>Staffurins</hi> who came
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114807:11"/>
hither, as <hi>comes itineris</hi> with the Helvetian Divines, the invitation was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the morrow at 11. of the clock. The President moreover with great
joy told the Synod that he had received news from the Magistrates of
<hi>Camps;</hi> whereby they signifie that they rest well satisfied in the last decree
of the Synod concerning the suspension of their cited ministers, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the same suspension, in case of their not comparence within 14. days
after new advertisement, that they would do what in them lyeth to perswade
them to comparence, which if they refused, that they would not give them any
more countenance or protection, as heretofore they had done; moreover
that they did with all due respect expect the resolutions of the Synod, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the points of religion now in question, to which they mean to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
themselves wholly, and by their own example of obedience, encourage
and perswade as much as in them lyeth their distracted people to yield the like
obedience, and that in the mean time the care of their Ministers Flocks should
be no pretence to their cited ministers for not comparence, because that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
their abscence, they themselves would undertake to see their cures suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
discharged both for reading and preaching of the word: I must needs
say this message was much unlike their former letters, which they were wont
to write in favour of their Remonstrant Ministers. Moreover the President
told us that D. <hi>Altingius</hi> one of the Palatine Divines, had brought him letters
to the Synod from old D. <hi>Paraeus</hi> of <hi>Heidelberge,</hi> together with his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in a written book of the five Articles in controversie, which he told us
should presently after the Synodical disquisition be read. We go on in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodical
disquisition of the fifth Article, where some of the provincials obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
some things, some nothing, and so at this Session quickly our disquisition
upon the first Article was ended; then <hi>Paraeus</hi> letters to the Synod were read;
the summe whereof was this, I am not so good an English man as to adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to translate, I will therefore give you the Latine.</p>

                        <hi>Sessio</hi> 100. 5. <hi>of March.</hi>] There was read publickly so much of <hi>Paraeus</hi> his
sentence as concerned the first and second Article, in which he did accurately
dispute against the Remonstrants opinion in both, and spent a great many pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in expounding and confirming the received distinction of the sufficiency
and efficiency of the merit of Christ his death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sessio</hi> 101. <hi>eodem die post meridiem.</hi>] Dr. <hi>Martinius</hi> of <hi>Breme</hi> aypointed by
the President publickly, all auditors admitted, did very accurately and sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discourse of the true Deity of Christ, and especially laboured to prove
his <hi>omnipraesentia,</hi> opposing and answering all those places of <hi>Vorstius</hi> in which
in his disputation <hi>de Deo</hi> he calleth the <hi>omnipraesentia</hi> of Christ into question.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sessio</hi> 102. 6. <hi>March.</hi>] We went on in the publick reading of D. <hi>Paraeus</hi>
his judgement upon the 3. 4. and 5. Articles; where I must needs say that he
did most accurately, and soundly, and methodically, with great subtilty and
variety of reasons overthrow the Remonstrants opinions of Resistibility of
grace, and the apostasie of the saints, one would little think that that wit and
judgement could be so young in so great age: the President told us that after
the Collegial judgement were read, that the Synod by their publick letters must
needs give him many thanks for these his great and good pains, as he did not
doubt but that the Estates General would take order for doing of the like.
So one of the Scribes by the President his appointment, was beginning to read
our Colledge his judgement, but D. <hi>Davenant</hi> told the President, that he
thought it greatly concerned the dignity of the Synod, that the Collegial suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages
should not be read thus privately, but that they should be read as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
as might be, all auditors being admitted; both because it might be
that the Remonstrants being moved by force of their reasons, might relent
something in their opinions; and all other auditors be edified and confirmed
in the truth, as likewise; because all auditors should perceive the consent of
so many several learned mens judgements, who by the more perverse sort
might otherwise be thought to use some plot and conspiracy to make their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
meet together. This unexpected motion did not a little trouble the
President, who was altogether set against any such course, which made all;
especially the <hi>exteri</hi> wonder that he should offer to pass over a matter of so
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114807:12"/>
great consequence without asking the Synods advice for the manner of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their own judgements; the reason why this motion was made by our
Colledge was this; in forming of our judgements, as we have studied to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
all in the Remonstrants, which can justly be taxed; so we took pains to
condemn no more but that which must be condemned, and to condemn too
some hard phrases of the <hi>contra</hi> Remonstrants, especially in the matter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation;
but they are only phrases; now we know that in the making of
the Canons no words of ours, which sound any thing that way shall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed,
because the provincials in forming of the Canons will carry us down
by voices; and therefore we desired that in the reading of our judgements,
at least our ingenuity might be taken notice of by all the auditors. Well to
this motion the President made this answer, that within these few days he
himself was in that same opinion which now was propounded; but having
with more mature deliberation thought upon it, and asked the advice of his
Assessors, that he had now thought it fit, the judgements should be read,
no auditors being admitted, unless it were some few choice ministers of good
worth, who did here attend about the Synod, the reasons moving them
thereunto were these. First, because this course seemeth to come nearer the
intent of the commission of the Estates General then the other, in which they
were appointed to enquire after Synodical suffrages privately among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
without other auditors, unless the Synod should think it fit to admit au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors.
Secondly, because it had been a custome hitherto observed in all Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods
and counsels to take the suffrages, all auditors being excluded. Thirdly,
because, though the suffrages of all Colledges do agree (as he perceived by
reading of them) in the thing it self; yet because there was some disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in phrases and forms of speaking, it was to be feared that the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants
and other Jesuits and Dominicans present, would make great matter
of these verbal differences, that they would cast abroad among the people
strange reports of the dissensions of the Synod, and in another case, that the
Remonstrants no question (as lately they had done) would put out in print
the opinion of the Synod concerning the Articles, before the Canons were
formed by the Synod, and in their pamphlet no doubt they would oppose
sentence to sentence, wheresoever they might take hold of the least suspition
of difference. Fourthly, and chiefly, because by this course the judgement
of the Synod concerning the 5. Articles, should go abroad among the people,
before either the Synod it self had determined what should be their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or the Estates General could be made acquainted with the judgements
of the Colledges and Synod, who notwithstanding in all reasons and good
manners ought next to the Synod it self, to know what is likely to be the event
of all business in it: the President added that since this was but a matter of
order, he hoped the Synod would trust him and the Assessors with the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
of it; but perceiving that a great many were not content with it, he was
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114807:12"/>
glad to put the matter to voices; the <hi>Delegats</hi> being asked their voice, they
desired the matter might be deferred till the afternoon, and so the Synod was
dismissed.</p>
                     <p>The President in mean time sent <hi>Dammanus</hi> one of the Scribes, to entreat us
to give way to the Presidents motion; and no question, they laboured other
Colledges as well as us; but certainly all the Presidents reasons above menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
might easily have been answered; for my part I think his course was <hi>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior,</hi>
but ours <hi>honestior.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sessio</hi> 103. <hi>eodem die post meridiem.</hi>] Voices were asked concerning the
manner of reading the Collegial judgements. The <hi>Delegats</hi> suffrage pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
by <hi>Heinsius</hi> was, that in reading of the judgements, all auditors
whatsoever, aswel <hi>contra</hi>-Remonst. as Remonst. should be excluded; and
besides they entreat all the members of the Synod, that they would conceal
as much as might be the things that were done in the Synod. The whole mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Synod without exception according to the judgement of the <hi>Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats.</hi>

judgements, at this Session were read the judgements of our Colledge,
and the Colledge of the <hi>Palatines,</hi> both of a just length, and agreeable in all
things; except that the <hi>Palatines</hi> had added to the end of theirs a very good
and necessary counsel for the sober and wholsome manner of propounding to
the people the doctrine of Election and Reprobation; we purpose after our
judgement on the fifth Article, to give in such a counsel for the sober pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding
of the whole five Articles to the people.</p>

                        <hi>Sessio</hi> 104. 7. <hi>March.</hi>] There were publickly read the judgements of the
Colledg of the <hi>Hassians</hi> who were exceeding long, of the <hi>Helvetians</hi> who were
but short and grave, of <hi>Alstedius,</hi> he who is only <hi>superstes</hi> of the <hi>Nassovians,</hi>
who was but short, there was no difference between their judgements, and
the others which were read before them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sessio</hi> 105. <hi>eodem die post meridiem.</hi>] There were read publickly, first the
judgement of the <hi>Genevenses,</hi> who were pretty long; they kept a form by
themselves, for where the confirmations of other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>olledges <hi>Theses,</hi> consisted
of reasons, places of Scriptures, and fathers, their confirmations were nothing
but places of Scripture, barely propounded in great number, and in a very
fine contexture and frame; at the end they used this short peroration, that
they had simply out of the Scripture delivered, that concerning the first Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle,
which they knew to be agreeable with the Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> nay, and
beside of all the Churches of <hi>France</hi> which did stick to the French confession.
Next was read the judgement of the <hi>Bremenses,</hi> which was of a just length
very sound and accurate, in all things agreeable to the other judgements
read before, except only with this difference; whereas other judgements had
said either nothing of the election and salvation of Infants begotten of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
parents, and dying in their Infancy, or they which had touched it, had
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114807:13"/>
determined that faithful parents had no reason to doubt of it; but might ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well for any thing they did know hope and perswade themselves of it: the
<hi>Bremonses</hi> did absolutely determine that all such Infants dying in their infancie
if they were baptized were certainly saved, concluding it not only <hi>ex judicio
charitatis</hi> as others had done, but <hi>ex judicio certitudinis</hi> too: Next begun to
be read the judgement of the Divines of <hi>Embdane;</hi> from whom (as Mr.
<hi>Hales</hi> well knoweth) extraordinary prolixity was to be expected; after it had
been read half an houre the President told us, that because the houre was past,
the rest must be left till the morrow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sessio</hi> 106. 8. <hi>Martii.</hi>] We went on in reading the judgement of the <hi>Emb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danes,</hi>
which at this Session continued yet full two houres, in the coldest
weather that we have felt. So now the judgements of all the <hi>Exteri Theologi</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the first Article were read, among whom there was nothing to be seen
but full and orthodoxal consent, for which the President told us God was to
be praised, and he prayed God that the like Harmonie might be found among
the Provincials: my Lord this is worth the observing, that there is no Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
yet which hath not overthrown <hi>Gomarus</hi> his opinion of the subject of
Predestination; for though none of them did directly dispute against it, yet all
of them expresly took it as granted, that not <hi>homo creabilis,</hi> but <hi>homo lapsus</hi>
was <hi>subjectum</hi> both of Election and Reprobation, which I think doth trouble
<hi>Gomarus</hi> not a little. Now the <hi>Embdanes</hi> judgement being ended, we begun
to read the judgement of the Colledge of the Belgick professors, where at the
very first to our grief we observed the Belgick humour of particular opinions;
for there are but five of that Colledge as we are of ours, and yet they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into three parts, and have given in three distinct and several judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
D. <hi>Polyander,</hi> D. <hi>Thysius,</hi> and D. <hi>Wallaeus</hi> have given in and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
one judgement, Dr. <hi>Sibrandus</hi> hath given in another judgement by
himself; and D. <hi>Gomarus</hi> a third judgement by himself; at the latter end of
this Session the first three their judgements begun to be read; but by that
time two pages were read the houre was passed, and so the rest of it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
till the next occasion, only my L. I must tell you that so much as was
read, giveth us little hope of agreement among them, for where as other
Colledges had taken it as granted only, that <hi>ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>o lapsus</hi> was <hi>subjectum Praede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinationis,</hi>
they in these two pages did only dispute by many arguments against
<hi>Gomarus</hi> his opinion, and proved that largely, which others had only taken
as a ground, their arguments <hi>Gomarus</hi> I see him note; what difference shall
further happen in their judgements, your L. shall understand by my next.</p>

substituted in the place of D. <hi>Bisterfield,</hi> who died here, was with the
accustomed solemnity admitted into the Synod: we go on in reading the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the three Belgick professors, which was very sound and of a just
length; it was subscribed by their three names: <hi>Johannes Polyander, Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
Thysius, Anthonius Wallaeus,</hi> and a little beneath, that it was thus written,
<hi>Ego Sibrandus Lubertus hoc collegarum m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

probo; Gomarus</hi> his name was not at it; but he presently rose and testified
<hi>viva voce,</hi> that he had read it, and did in all things approve the judgement
of his Colleagues, excepting only that part of it, which did determine <hi>homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem lapsum</hi>
to be the object of Predestination, which he said had not as yet
been determined in the Belgick Churches, in the French nor English
Churches, and many others. Next was read the judgement of D. <hi>Sibrandus</hi>
upon the same article, which differed nothing from that former of his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues,
but that it was longer, it was subscribed with his own name, and a
little beneath the former three professors by their subscriptions testified, that
they had read it, and did approve it. <hi>Gomarus</hi> stood up, and <hi>viva voce</hi> gave
this same testimony to this judgement which he had given to the former, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
the same exception. Next was <hi>Gomarus</hi> his judgement read upon the
same Article; he said nothing of that question of the object of predestination,
whether it was <hi>homo lapsus</hi> or not, which silence in that point being excepted,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114807:14"/>
his judgement in all points agreed with the former judgements of his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues,
it was only subscribed with his own name; but D. <hi>Polyander</hi> did <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va
voce</hi> testifie in the name of himself and his Colleagues, that they did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
all things in <hi>Gomarus</hi> his judgement, excepting only that opinion of the
object, the contrary whereof they professed themselves to hold: the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
instructed us concerning some particulars of the business of <hi>Camps,</hi> and
desired us against three of the clock in the afternoon to consult about it; the
particulars whereof your L. shall see in the next Session.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Sessio</hi> 109. <hi>eodemdie post meridiem.</hi>] The President told us first, that the
time of fourteen days granted to the two suspended Ministers of <hi>Camps</hi> for
their comparence was now passed, and so that they contemned this favourable
respite granted by the Synod, &amp; persisted in their contumacy. Next that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
two Ministers of <hi>Camps,</hi> who were here among the cited Remonstrants
had been appointed by the Synod to give in within 14. dayes an answer to the
accusations layed against them by the deputies of the Reformed Church of
<hi>Camps;</hi> the copy of which accusations at their own earnest request had been
delivered to them by one of the servants of the Synod, but that now in place
of their answer which was expected, they had sent to him a letter which was
read unto the Synod; it had two great faults, it was exceeding long, and
exceeding foolish; to this sense or rather none-sense, they did show that
they could not at the day appointed give in their answer to the accusations;
and why they could no more go on in this Synodical action which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced
against them; for many causes, such as were, first, because they
were wholly taken up in making ready some writings for the Synod concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the five Articles, which were imposed on them by the commandement of
the <hi>Delegats.</hi> 2. Because the copy of the accusations brought unto them
by one of the Synod officers, was not subscribed by the President, nor by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of the Scribes of the Synod; and therefore they thought it not an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick
copy or of any credit. 3. Because crimes in it were objected to them
both promiscuously, and that laid to both their charge, which only one of
them had delivered; and therefore their accusation was not exact according
to form of law. 4. That there were many things in it objected to them, not
warranted by any witness, unless it were by some proofs taken out of their
Colleague <hi>Foskculius</hi> late book, which they christened with the name of <hi>stul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>
and <hi>tenebricosum scriptum.</hi> 5. Because it was full of false spellings and
writing, and therefore they thought it was but negligently stubbered over;
for these and many more such causes as idle as these, (with which I hold it not
fit to detain your L.) though they might decline the judgement of the Synod,
especially since against the practise of the Belgick Church, their own consisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Classis, and Provincial Synod being skipped over, they were immediately
accused before the Synod; yet notwithstanding after they had done with all
they had to say upon the five Articles, they promise that they will give in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114807:14"/>
their answer to this bill of accusations; but upon this condition, (which I
beseech your L. to observe,) that first the Synod would declare them to be
free from these false and malitious slanders, wherewith they &amp; the rest of their
brethren Remonstrants cited to the Synod, had been most injuriously and
falsely charged in that Session of the Synod, in which they were dismissed by
the President, with this <hi>elogium,</hi> to wit, that they had refused to go on in
the Synodical action; that they had showen themselves unworthy with whom
the Synod should have any further dealing; and that as they had begun this
business and continued it with lying and equivocations, so now they had ended
it. But yet that notwithstanding of all this they were contented to go on in
this action before the Colledge of the <hi>Delegats</hi> of the Estates General, but not
before the Synod. These long letters being read, next was read an answer
to these letters penned by the deputies of the reformed Church of <hi>Camps;</hi> to
whom the President had given these letters that they might answer them,
they did meet particularly with every thing alledged in the other letters,
which was needless; and therefore I omit all their answers, save only to that
one thing which seemed to require one, that was, that against the custome
of their Church they were immediately brought before the Synod, to which
it was answered, that both the consistory and <hi>Classis</hi> of <hi>Camps</hi> were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Remonstrantical, and that therefore they were both of them such as
ought rather to be abrogated then appealed unto; but for their Provincial
Synod, they wondered with what face they durst affirm they had not been cited
thither, since that Synod had dealt with them oftner then once, though to
no purpose. Next was read a supplication penned and subscribed by <hi>Acro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
in name of the Reformed Church of <hi>Camps,</hi> in which they relate how
<hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>skulius</hi> one of the two suspended at <hi>Camps,</hi> while he was rehearsing unto
his flock the sentence of his own suspension, that he had stirred up the people
<hi>ad tumultuariam infamam:</hi> next they humbly beseech the Synod, that now
for the two suspended, their sentence of suspension might be ratified by the
Synod, and for the other two here present at Dort, to wit, <hi>Mathisius</hi> and
<hi>Gosuinus,</hi> since they had refused to give in their answer at the time appointed,
that the Synod would pronounce the like sentence of suspension against them:
the President propounded this to the Synod, whether they thought it fit that
the sentence already given against the former two should be ratified, and that
the other two should be cited to give in their answer to the bill of accusations
within fourteen days, in which if they failed, the like sentence of suspension
should be given against them, which had been given against their Colleagues;
the whole Synod approved it, and so it was decreed.</p>
                     <p>We beginning to go on in reading the Collegial judgements; but my L.
of <hi>Landaffe</hi> (according as we at home had deliberated among our selves) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
leave to speak, which being granted he spake to this purpose. D <hi>Goma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
in the forenoon delivered, that this question, whether <hi>homo lapsus</hi> be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114807:15"/>
                        <hi>subjectum Praedestinationis,</hi> had not been determined by the confession of the
Church of <hi>France;</hi> and as I and my Colleagues conceived he delivered the
like for the confession of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> and therefore I do entreat
D. <hi>Gomarus</hi> in my own name, and the name of my Colleagues to declare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Synod, whether he did say so or not. D. <hi>Gomarus</hi> with good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty
answered that indeed he did say so, but he protested it was not out of
any evil meaning, but only to shew that as other Churches, so the Church of
<hi>England</hi> had left that undetermined, since the words of the confession deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
no farther of the subject, then (<hi>quosdam ex humano genere</hi>) my Lord
of <hi>Landaffe</hi> replied, that he himself and the rest of his Colleagues could not
chuse but think themselves by that speech touched for temerity or ignorance;
for since they in their judgement had delivered the contrary for <hi>homo lapsus,</hi>
it was as much to say as that they had delivered that in the Synod, which was
not according to the judgement of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but to let the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
know that they had said nothing in their judgement, which was not the
judgement of their Church, they desired the Synod to hear the words of
their confession; so D. <hi>Goad</hi> read publickly the 17. Article of the confession,
where the words are <hi>quosdam ex humano genere, in exitio et maledicto,</hi> which
last words <hi>Gomarus</hi> had left out: <hi>Gomarus</hi> answered, that if he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
the words of the confession amiss, he would submit himself to the
judgement of the Synod. The President told <hi>Gomarus</hi> roundly enough, that
it was free for every member of the Synod to deliver his own judgement con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
any point or question; but that men ought to be very careful that
they do not rashly meddle with the judgements of other Churches. My L. of
<hi>Landaffe</hi> desired further leave to adde this. Since all the forraign Divines,
without exception, and likewise all the Belgick professors except <hi>Gomarus,</hi>
had already delivered their judgements for <hi>homo lapsus,</hi> and that he doubted
not but the Provincials would determine the same; it were very fit that the
Synod should likewise determine so of it; neither was it any reason that for
the particular opinion of one professor, who in this did disassent from the
judgement of all the reformed Churches, the Synod should abstain from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of the question. <hi>Gomarus</hi> answered, that the University of <hi>Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi>
had never yet determined for <hi>homo lapsus,</hi> and that both D. <hi>Whittakers,</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> had determined the contrary, whom he took to be such men
as would not disassent from the confession of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> that
the matter ought first to be discussed with arguments on both sides, before
any thing should be determined on either side; to whom the President re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
this answer, that after the judgements of all the Colledges were read,
the Synod would decree of that question what they shall think best; after the
Canon is conceived it shall be read, if then you can shew that any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in that Canon is against the word of God. The Synod shall with al
dutiful patience here what you can say.</p>

which foure were of a good length, and in all things consonant to the former

                        <hi>Sessio</hi> 111. <hi>eodem die post meridiem.</hi>] There were read the Collegial judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the <hi>Drentani,</hi> and <hi>Gallobelgici,</hi> which were brief, and agreeable to
the former judgements, and so was ended the reading of the judgements of
all Colledges; in which (God be praised for it) there was not the least suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of of dissention of any thing, and it is to be noted that all of them deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<hi>homo laepsus</hi> to be the subject of Predestination; except <hi>Gomarus</hi> whom
all men know to be against it; and the South-<hi>Hollandi,</hi> who only said they
would determine nothing of it.</p>
                     <p>There was read the judgement of the Divines of Great <hi>Brittain</hi> upon the
second Article; they were briefer then upon the first Article, they left the
received distinction of <hi>sufficientiae</hi> and <hi>efficacia mortis Christi</hi> untouched; as
likewise they did not touch that received restriction of those places which make
Christs suffering general to the world, only <hi>ad mundum Electorum.</hi> There
were read the judgements of the <hi>Palatines,</hi> of the <hi>Hassians,</hi> of the <hi>Helvetians,</hi>
who all did maintain the received distinction, to wit, that Christ his death
was only sufficient for all men, not efficient or impetrative, and did restrain
all the general propositions which are in Scripture to that purpose only <hi>ad
mundum Electorum,</hi> concluding that Christ was no wayes <hi>expiatio pro peccatis
singulorum.</hi>

                        <hi>Sessio</hi> 112. 13. <hi>Martii.</hi>] There was read publickly the judgement of the
<hi>Nassovici,</hi> after them the judgement of the <hi>Genevenses,</hi> both of which defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the received distinction and restriction; after were read the judgements
of the <hi>Bremenses,</hi> who according to the number of their persons had three se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
judgements. <hi>Martinius</hi> his judgement was first read, who did stand
in effect to the tenents of the Remonstrants in the second Article, he mainly
overthrew the received distinction and restriction and did determine that
Christ did truly die for all and every man, that he was made a propitiation
both for the godly and wicked, and that by his death he did impetrate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
with God for them all, at the latter end he condemned many
things both in the Remonstrants, and in the <hi>Contra-</hi>Remonstrants opinion,
but more in the <hi>Contra-</hi>Remonst. next D. <hi>Isselburgius</hi> the second <hi>Bremensis</hi> his
judgement was read, who was directly against <hi>Martinius</hi> defending both
the received distinction and restriction. Thirdly, was read the judgement
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114807:16"/>
of D. <hi>Crocius</hi> the third <hi>Bremensis,</hi> who propounded a middle way between
his two Colleagues; granting (which we also in our Colledge did) that
Christ did merit by his death some supernatural things for the wicked; as the
word preached, and all such good graces as are common both to the godly
and wicked, but nothing belonging to remission of sin or reconciliation with
God, and so indeed for any thing I could perceive his judgement was directly
against that of <hi>Martinius,</hi> and in effect all one with that of <hi>Isselburgius.</hi>
Next was read the judgement of the <hi>Embdani,</hi> who were exceeding long, and
agreed in all things with the <hi>Contra-</hi>Remonstrants, as they do express them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in the <hi>Collat. Hagiensis.</hi>

                        <hi>Sessio</hi> 113. <hi>eodem die post meridiem.</hi>] D. <hi>Isselburgius</hi> one of the <hi>Bremenses,</hi>
at the President his appointment publickly all auditors being admitted, did
at very great length prove that God his vindicative justice is natural and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
unto him, and that therefore that satisfaction which Christ made for
the sins of the world was <hi>simpliciter necessaria,</hi> proving withal by many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
the fulness and sufficiency of Christ his satisfaction; answering the
arguments of <hi>Socinus</hi> and <hi>Vorstius</hi> against both the former conclusions.</p>

                        <hi>Sessio</hi> 114. 14. <hi>die Martii.</hi>] There was read the judgement of foure of the

a little beneath was written <hi>Ego Sibrandus Lubertus hoc Collegarum meorum ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicium
per omnia probo:</hi> next was read <hi>Sibrandus</hi> his judgement who diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
nothing from his colleagues, save that he was shorter, it was subscribed
first by himself, and then approved by the subscriptions of the rest of his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues;
all five of them did stand mainly for the above named distinction
&amp; restriction. Next was read the judgement of the <hi>Geldri,</hi> who were too
too rigid in many things, next them the judgement of the South-<hi>Hollandi</hi>
next them the judgement of the North-<hi>Hollandi,</hi> who had many things which
we thought not only to be rigid but false, all these three Colledges at great

<hi>Gallobelgici,</hi> who were moderate enough, both of them did maintain the
former distinction and restriction; and so was ended the reading of all Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gial

recompense, your L. may justly look for your reward in heaven; I pray God
send us out of the second Article well, and I shall be perswaded of Harmony
in all the rest: for in good faith some of the Provincials especially the <hi>Geldri,</hi>
and the North-<hi>Hollandi;</hi> who are of all in the Synod, greatest in the Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent

adviseth from the King about the Palatines, it is a thing absolutely necessary, for
they are the only <hi>Magistrales Doctores next to Gomarus in all the Synod,</hi> and
think every thing they speak should be taken for text: in good faith in their
judgement upon the second Article, they did gird most bitterly at some
things which D. <hi>Ward</hi> had delivered in the Synod of that same Article, with
which D. <hi>Ward</hi> is very much moved. Our judgement in the second Article
is already read in the Synod, so we must study to frame our selves to our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections

is to have us conform our selves to the received distinction and restriction,
with which his grace acquainted his Majesty and received approbation from
him: but I must needs say, <hi>that the directions which your L. hath sent from Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary
Nanton, do seem to will us to be as favourable to the general propositions
as may be, giving as little offence to the Lutherans as we can,</hi> which counsel in
my poor judgement we have in our <hi>Theses</hi> already followed.</p>
                     <p>Frequent admonitions and exhortations rather from your L. or by your L.

bond of peace may hinder much indiscretion in this Synod, in which as I hope

your L. will not be wanting; so by Gods grace I shall not be wanting to
give your L. all convenient information, not be wanting in my prayers to the

                     <p>SInce my last unto your L. there have been but three Sessions; no matter
of moment hath been done in them, and therefore I will defer the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of them to my next letters: only I thought good to let your L. know that
yesterday after the forenoon Session, the President called me into his lodging,
and told me he would show me a miracle, which in truth he did; for there
he showed me a volume which the Remonstrants that morning had given in
to the <hi>Delegats</hi> upon the 3. 4. and 5. Articles; I was I confesse astonished
when I looked on it; for I could not with mine one hand lift it from the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
it is above twice as much as all they have given in yet; in good faith my
Lord I think it is fully as big as one of our Church great Bibles; which I
would have your L. think I speak without any figure, trope, or Rhetoricallie,
for it is so big, I told the President, that it was a thing impossible the Synod
could take notice of the contents of that volume under six moneths, he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
me that for my comfort he would show me two lines in the Preface,
which would rid me of that fear, and so he did; for in these lines they doe
protest that they do not offer this volume to the Synod, for they profess that
they have nothing, nor will have nothing to do with the Synod, Since the
Synod hath refused to have any doings with their living persons, but only
their dead books, and therefore they do only offer this book to the <hi>Delegats,</hi>
but will not have it thought by any man that they offer it to the Synod:
<hi>Heinsius</hi> dyned with us yesterday, and I asked him when they had given in
this book, he told me that morning, but with such impudence as is almost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible;
for when one of the <hi>Delegats</hi> told them that he wondered why they
would give in so much paper as was impossible it should ever be read in the
Synod, <hi>Episcopius</hi> answered they had nothing to do with the Synod, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
it only to them who were the <hi>Delegats;</hi> the former <hi>Delegat</hi> replied,
that the <hi>Delegats</hi> were not to judge of their opinions, but the Synod; and
that in their letters citatorie they were warned to come and give an account to
the Synod of the doctrine which they had delivered in their Schools and Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits;
<hi>Episcopius</hi> most impudently answered thus briefly: we here delivered
to you the <hi>Delegats</hi> this book and to none else, if you be pleased to take it
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114807:18"/>
from us, we will leave it with you, if not, we pray you give it us again, and
we will keep it; one of the <hi>Delegats</hi> commanded <hi>Heinsius</hi> to write down that
their peremptory and saucy answer, <hi>Episcopius</hi> very bravely told <hi>Heinsius</hi> that
they would save him that labour, for they had set down the same words alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
in their Preface, and pointed out to him the place where he might finde
them: so that my L. they were never since the beginning of the Synod so lusty
as now, so as none can chuse but think that they yet have some secret and
sure hopes. I forget to tell your L. that the President told me he had been
glancing at this volume, and he findes it to be in many parts a confuration of
the several discourses which have been had publickly in the Synod upon the
five Articles. There is some ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

he be cited your L. credit with the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> and count <hi>William</hi> must
help us for discretion in dealing with him, else he will keep the Synod as long
as the Remonstrants did; your L. I hope will give counsel to them, that if
<hi>Vorstius</hi> should desire to have time to give in apologies and explications, for
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>he hard speeches in his book <hi>De Deo;</hi> and should desire to be convinced with
Reason, and satisfaction of his arguments; all which would take up a long time,
that the Synod would talk of no such matter with him, but in plain terms tell
him that all the members of the Synod had read his book, and found many
things in it very neer unto open blasphemy, and scandalous without all question
to the reformed religion; that explications of things which are not once to
be called in question, is no satisfaction; and they therefore only desire to
know whether he will make a plain recantation and denial of it, and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ask God forgiveness for it, and his Church likewise there assembled, whom
by that book he hath scandilized; if he do this we gain him; if not, then
without any more ado, let the Synod censure him as they shall think fit; I
wish that to the terror of others he might solemnly be excommunicated in the
Synod; in this and all other businesses we do and must relie upon your L. care,

Churches; Likewise an Exhortation to all the Members of the Synod for
avoiding harshness and rigidity, and embracing of all moderation in making
the Cannos, especially upon the second Article; as likewise an admonition
to the Provincials, for great wariness and discretion, in propounding to the
common People the Doctrine of Predestination, and especially Reprobation;
these things we told his Majesty, desired us to observe, and so with a Prayer
we wisht both we and all the Synod might be careful in the observing of
them; There was read the judgement of the <hi>Palatines,</hi> at the end whereof
they annexed an Epilogue much to the same purpose with ours; In all the
judgements that were read upon this Article, it is to be observed that every
Colledge concluded with such an Epilogue and a Prayer.</p>

And so was happily ended the reading of all the Collegial judgements upon
the five Articles, in which, praised be God for it, there was seen an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
harmony, far greater then almost could be hoped for in so great an Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
of so many learned men. The President told us that the Estates Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
between this and <hi>Easter</hi> did expect that the Cannons should be made, and
therefore did desire that against the morrow at ten of the Clock every Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
would depute one, who might meet about the conceaving of the Canons,
that one should relate to the rest of their Colledge, what Articles they agreed
upon, and accordingly consult with them to know what they would have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
paired, or changed, so after these deputed &amp; had agreed, the Cannons
should be publickly read and approved.</p>
                     <p>This is all, but that I think our President hath need of your L. good coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel,

                     <p>WHat stir we have had about the making of our Cannons your L. shall
understand by letters from our whole Colledge; if we had not written
a common Letter, and then your L. should have taken some particular notice
of the contents of mine, the rest of my Colleagues must needs have suspected
that your L. had had intelligence from me; And therefore I did presently
deal with my Lord and the rest of our Society, that they would write a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Letter to your L. concerning the particular passages of this troublesome
business, These three things I may say in it; First, that the President would
take upon him more then ever any President did, to make Cannons and pass
them by <hi>placet</hi> or <hi>non placet,</hi> and then he hath so many of the Provincialls as
command to pass what he will, I cannot I confess yet see how it can consist with
the dignity of any, much more of some of the Members of the Synod, that
the President should dictate Cannons and the rest especially a Bishop write
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114807:19"/>
after him; so that he maketh the Canons, and the whole Synod are called
<hi>non ad consilium sed tantum consensum.</hi> Next I think my L. that if the Synod
had wanted but two men which are of it, we had wanted a great deal of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
which I perceive will not forsake the Synod so long as they are in it;
I mean <hi>Sibrandus</hi> and <hi>Gomarus;</hi> they keep their fits of madness by course; the
last fit before this came to <hi>Gomarus</hi> his turn, and this day <hi>Sibrandus</hi> flew out,
but with such Raving and fierceness of countenance, such unheard <hi>bitternes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
our Colledge;</hi> as I desire no other revenge on him then the very speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the words, which while they were in his mouth, were checked by
both Presidents Politick and Ecclesiastical; D. <hi>Davenant</hi> who is a very mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
man, would have answered him much against my will, and no man could
blame him, for <hi>Sibrandus</hi> his words against our Colledge, if they had come
from a wise man his lips, had been above the strength of patience, I was glad
the President gave not way to D. <hi>Davenant</hi> speech, which notwithstanding, I
am sure would have been full of discretion; and for <hi>Sibrandus</hi> I blame him
and <hi>Gomarus</hi> no more for these extasies, then I do a stone for going down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
since it is both their natural constitution. Thirdly, if your L. care do
not now most of all show it self for procuring of good counsel to be sent hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the constitution of the Canons, we are are like to make the Synod a
thing to be laughed at in after ages. The President and his provincials have
no care of the credit of strangers, nor of that account which we must yield at
our return unto all men that shall be pleased to call for it; their Canons they
would have them so full charged with catechetical speculations, as they will
be ready to burst, and I perceive it plainly, that there is never a <hi>contra</hi>-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrant
minister in the Synod, that hath delivered any doctrine which hath
been excepted against by the Remonstrants, but they would have it in by
head and shoulders in some Canon, that so they might have something to
show for that which they have said: God his goodness toward his Church,
and your L. vigilant constancy in perfecting this good course, which you were
so careful to procure, I hope will teach us to overcome all these difficulties.</p>
                     <p>In my last letter I wrote as I suspect, that the <hi>Palatines</hi> inveighed against
some things delivered by Dr. <hi>Ward</hi> in the 3. and 4. Articles; if I had so, I
was mistaken, I should have said the second Article. We shall have no more
Sessions till all be agreed upon in private Colledges; and therefore I thought
to have come over to have done my duty to your L. this Easter, but I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand

                     <p>ALL my answer to your L. arguments is my acknowledgement of your L.
extraordinary courtesie in your kinde invitations. I could not be so fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in my mourning apparel as I would before Saturday at night: besides we
must now narrowly look to the Canons which are sent to us by the Deputies
of the Synod; for we are required upon Tuseday next to give in our obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
upon them; my L. of <hi>Landaffe</hi> being one of the Deputies, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
delivered his opinion of them; and therefore his L. may here be spared
till Wednesday next, the rest of us have not, and it being the main business
of our coming hither, we must plie it so as it may be done to some good pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
My L. of <hi>Landaffe</hi> his comming to your L. telleth me that the writing
of any occurrences here are needless; so with the continuance of my best
wishes for your L. health and happiness, I take my leave; and shall ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
it a great part of my temporal happiness, if your L. shall be pleased to
account me as I am:</p>

                     <p>THis place is yet still barren of news, but I make no question but my next
letters shall send your L. some. The Deputies appointed by the Synod
have taken pains I must needs confess to give our Colledge all satisfaction;
besides the second Article, some of our Colledge have been earnest to have
this proposition out. (<hi>Infideles damnabuntur non solum ob infidelitatem, sed
etiam ob omnia alia peccata suatam originale quam actualia.</hi>) Because they
say that from thence may be inferred that original sin is not remitted to all who
are baptized, which opinion hath been by more then one councel condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
as heretical: they have therefore at their request put it out; so I know
now of no matter of disagreement among us worthy the speaking of: the
morrow there is a Synod, one way or other we shall determine what shall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
of the Canons, what we do your L. by Gods grace with the first occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114807:20"/>
shall understand. I have here sent your L. my speech made in the Synod;
I know your L. experience will pardon the imperfections of a discourse delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
upon less then two days warning. Now my Lord, to write a History of
Dr. <hi>Goad</hi> his journey and mine own, between <hi>Roterdam</hi> and <hi>Dort</hi> that night,
on which we came from your L. would move too much pity, especially if you
should make relation of the same to my Lady: the compend of it is this; that
a little after five a clock in the afternoon we took ship at <hi>Roterdam,</hi> and about
a little after one of the clock in the night we arrived at <hi>Dort,</hi> but could get
no entrance; and therefore until half an houre past five in the morning, we
sometime lay in the ship, sometime walked on the Bulwark: if we were not
sufficiently assaulted with cold and watching we know our selves. Mr. <hi>Downs</hi>
his wooing in Greek was never so cold as we were that night: Letters I have
received from <hi>England:</hi> the summe of the news are, that the Spanish Navie is
dissipated, and that it never exceeded 60. sayles. The King of <hi>Spain</hi> hath
written large letters with his own hand to our King; in which he protesteth,
that he never intended any thing against <hi>England</hi> nor any Christian Kingdom.
The talk of the Spanish match hath of late been very fresh again in <hi>England,</hi>
but this is certain that the other day at <hi>Theobalds</hi> the King asking a gentleman
of good note what the people talked of the Spanish Navie, received of him
this answer: Sir <hi>the people is nothing so much affraid of the Spaniards powder
as of their match.</hi> My Lord I can but thank your L. for all your courtesies, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
your L. great kindeness at my last being with you, which since my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
will not give me leave to requite, I must take leave to acknowledge.
With the remembrance of my best duty and service to your L. and your worthy
Lady, and my faithful wishes for both your happiness, I take my leave, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping

in which was nothing done, but that it was reasoned whither that last hete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodox
should be retained; our Colledge in that whole Session maintained dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute

most curious, and yet would have it retained only to make the Remonstrants
odious, though they finde the very contrary of that they would father upon
them in their words. That day in the afternoon was another Session, in
which were read the Canons of the 3. 4. and 5. Articles and were approved,
the particular passages of these Sessions I will send your L. by the next occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
they were no great matters in them, yet when I send your L. the
next Sessions in which it is like that something will be done, I will send a note
of them too: yesterday there was no Session, but the Deputies met for ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
order about the Preface and Epilogue of the Canons, and mending those
things in the Canons which were thought fit to be amended, and have sent
them worse then they were; in case we stand, and what need of counsel we
have, this worthy Dr. will sufficiently inform your L. My Lord, I have had
a great deal of talk with Mr. <hi>Douglas</hi> about the controversies in this Church,
and finde him unquestionably sound in them, also that there is no fear of his
opinions, if otherwise he be found sufficient: I much wonder that we do

those who were present at them: and what strange carriage hath been in

a thing of great consequence, we were never made acquainted with before

<hi>Amen</hi> to it; between the forenoon and the afternoon Session, there was
strange labouring with the <hi>Exteri</hi> for getting their consent to it; yet we

Canon; never did any Church of old, nor any reformed Church propose

Mr. <hi>Farindon</hi> had not died before
the Impression of this Book, you had
received from that excellent hand an
exact account of the <hi>Authours Life,</hi>
which he had begun, and resolved to
perfect, and prefix to this Edition. And
as the loss of him is great in many particulars, so especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
in this; because there was none to whom Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>
was so throughly known as unto him, nor was there any so
able to declare his worth, partly by reason of his own abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
eminently known principally because he learn'd his
Authour from an intimate converse, who was a man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to be truly express'd but by himself.</p>
                  <p>I am therefore to entreat thee, Reader, being deprived of
the <hi>proper Plutarch,</hi> not to expect any such thing as a
Life from me, but to accept of so much onely as is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
If Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> were unknown unto thee, be
pleased to believe what I know and affirm to be true of
him; if he were known, then onely be satisfied that what
is published in his name did really proceed from him: and
<pb facs="tcp:114807:28"/>
more then this needs not to be spoken in reference to the
advancement of this Work; because he which knew
or believeth what an excellent person Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> was, and
shall be also perswaded that he was the Author of this Book,
cannot chuse but infinitely desire to see and read him
in it.</p>
                  <p>In order to the First of these, I shall speak no more
than my own long experience, intimate acquaintance,
and high veneration grounded upon both, shall freely
and sincerely prompt me to. <hi>Mr. John Hales,</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
Greek Professour of the University of <hi>Oxford,</hi>
long Fellow of <hi>Eton College,</hi> and at last also
Prebendary of <hi>Windsore,</hi> was a man, I thinke, of
as great a sharpness, quicknesse and subtilty of wit
as ever this; or, perhaps, any Nation bred. His
industry did strive, if it were possible, to equall
the largenesse of his capacity, whereby he became as
great a Master of polite, various and Universall
Learning as ever yet convers'd with Bookes. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate
to his reading was his Meditation, which
furnished him with a Judgement beyond the vulgar
reach of man, built upon unordinary Notions, rais'd
out of strange observations and comprehensive thoughts
within himselfe. So that he really was a most prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Example of an acute and piercimg Wit, of a vast
and illimited Knowledge, of a severe and profound Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Although this may seeme, as in it selfe it truly is,
<pb facs="tcp:114807:28"/>
a grand <hi>Elogium;</hi> yet I cannot esteem him lesse in
any thing which belongs to a good man then in those
intellectuall perfections: and had he never understood a
letter hee had other Ornaments sufficient to endear
him. For he was of a Nature (as we ordinarily
speake) so kinde, so sweet, so courting all mankind,
of an affability so prompt, so ready to receive all
conditions of men, that I conceive it neer as easie
a task for any one to become so Knowing as so Oblige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>A a Christian, none more ever acquainted with
the nature of the Gospel, because none more Studious
of the knowledge of it, or more curious in the
search, which being strengthened by those great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
before mentioned could not prove otherwise
then highly effectuall. He took indeed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
a liberty of judgeing, not of others, but for
himselfe: and if ever any man might be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in these matters to judge, it was he who had so
long, so much, so advantageously consider'd, and
which is more, never had the least worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
in his determinations. He was not onely most
truly and strictly Just in his Secular transactions,
most exemplarily Meeke and Humble notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his perfections, but beyond all example Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
giving unto all, preserving nothing but his
Bookes to continue his learning and himselfe: which
when he had before digested, he was forced at
<pb facs="tcp:114807:29"/>
last to feed upon, at the same time the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
and most unfortunate <hi>helluo</hi> of Books the grand
example of learning and of the envy and contempt
which followeth it.</p>
                  <p>This testimony may be truly given of his Person, and
nothing in it liable to the least exception but this alone,
that it comes far short of him, Which intimation I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
more necessary for such as knew him not than all
which hath been said.</p>
                  <p>In reference to the second part of my Design, I confess,
while he lived none was ever more sollicited and urged to
write, and thereby truly to teach the world, than he; none
ever so resolved (pardon the expression, so obstinate) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
it. His facile and courteous nature learnt onely not
to yield to that sollicitation. And therefore the World
must be content to suffer the losse of all his learning with
the deprivation of himself: and yet he cannot be accused
for hiding of his talent, being so communicative that his
chamber was a Church and his chair a Pulpit.</p>
                  <p>Onely that there might be some taste continue of him:
here are some of his <hi>Remaines</hi> recollected; such as he
could not but write, and such as when written were out of
his power to destroy. These consist of two parts, of <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi>
and of <hi>Letters,</hi> and each of them proceeded

                  <p>I Am very glad you chose so Judicious an Overseer of
those <hi>SERMONS</hi> of Mr. <hi>HALES</hi> as Mr. <hi>Gunning,</hi>
whom I alwayes have had in high esteem both for his
Learning and Piety; and I am of his Opinion, that
they may pass for extraordinary. That Sermon of
<hi>Wresting hard places of Scripture</hi> may well begin your Collection. The
other on <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 1. <hi>Him that is weak in the Faith receive,</hi> &amp;c. was
preacht at <hi>Pauls</hi> Cross, and I moved him to print it. That of <hi>My
Kingdom is not of this World;</hi> I once saw and returned to Mr. <hi>Hales</hi>
with foure more which I saw him put into Mr. <hi>Chillingworths</hi> hands:
I wish <hi>Dixi Custodiam</hi> were perfect, I have often heard him speak of
it with a kinde of Complacency. That of <hi>He speak a Parable that men
ought always to pray,</hi> I believe is his by the passage of the <hi>Spunge</hi> and
the <hi>Knife,</hi> which I have heard from his mouth. The Sermon which
you had from D. <hi>Hammond</hi> upon <hi>Son remember,</hi> &amp;c. was preacht at
<hi>Eaton Colledge.</hi> The other of Duels was either one or two, and
preacht at the <hi>Hague</hi> to Sr. <hi>D. Carlton</hi> and his company. That you
call a <hi>Letter</hi> on <hi>I can do all things,</hi> is a Sermon. The Sermon of <hi>Peter
went out and wept,</hi> &amp;c.—is under his own hand.</p>
                  <p>One caution I should put in, that you print nothing which is not
written with his own hand, or be very careful in comparing them,
for not long since one shewed me a Sermon, which he said was his,
which I am confident could not be; for I saw nothing in it which
was not <hi>Vulgaris monetae,</hi> of a vulgar stamp, common, and flat, and
low. There be some Sermons, that I much doubt of, for there is
little of his spirit and <hi>Genius</hi> in them, and some that are imperfect,
that of <hi>Genesis</hi> 17. 1. <hi>Walk before me,</hi> &amp;c. is most imperfect, as appears
by the <hi>Autographum</hi> which I saw at <hi>Eaton</hi> a fortnight since.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:114807:30"/>For his <hi>LETTERS,</hi> he had much trouble in that kinde from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
friends, and I heard him speak of that friends Letter you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
pleasantly, Mr.—<hi>He sets up Tops and I must whip them for him.</hi>
But I am very glad to hear you have gained <hi>Those Letters</hi> into your
hands written from the <hi>Synod of Dort,</hi> you may please to take notice
that in his younger days he was a Calvinist, and even then when he
was employed at that Synod, and at the well pressing 3. S. <hi>John</hi> 16.
by <hi>Episcopius,—there, I bid John Calvin good night,</hi> as he has often told
me. I believe they will be as acceptable, or in your phrase as Sale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
as his Sermons, I would not have you to venture those papers out
of your hands to me, for they may miscarry, and I fear it would be
very difficult to finde another Copy; peradventure I may shortly
see you, at the Term I hope I shall, and then I shall advise you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the best I can about those other Sermons you have.</p>
                  <p>I see you will be troubled yet a while to put things in a right way.
I have drawn in my minde the <hi>Model</hi> of his <hi>Life,</hi> but I am like
Mr. <hi>HALES</hi> in this, which was one of his <hi>defects,</hi> not to pen any
thing, till I must needs.</p>

                  <p>THE love and favour which it pleased God to bear our
Fathers before the law, so far prevail'd with him, as
that without any books and writings, by familiar and
friendly conversing with them, and communicating
himself unto them, he made them receive and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
his laws: their inward conceits and intellectuals being after
a wonderful manner as it were <hi>Figured,</hi> and <hi>Character'd,</hi>

a full assurance both who the author was, and how far his intent
and meaning reacht. We that are their ofspring ought, as St.

he had done, to conduct them into the promised land, but
would leave his Angel with them as his deputy: so hath he dealt
with us, the unhappy posterity degenerated from the antient purity
of our forefathers. When himself refused to speak unto our hearts
because of the hardness of them, he then began to put his laws in
writing. Which thing for a long time amongst his own people
seems not to have brought with it any sensible inconvenience. For
amongst all those acts of the Jews, which God in his book hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistred
for our instruction, there is not one concerning any pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ambiguitie or obscurity of the Text and Letter of their Law,
which might draw them into faction and schisme; the Devil belike
having other sufficient advantages on which he wrought. But ever
since the Gospel was committed to writing, what age, what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument
of the Churches acts is not full of debate and strife, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the force and meaning of those writings, which the holy
Ghost hath left us to be the law and rule of faith? St. <hi>Paul,</hi> one of
the first penmen of the Holy Ghost, who in Paradise heard words
which it was not lawful for man to utter, hath left us words in
writing, which it is not safe for any man to be too busie to interpret.
No sooner had he laid down his pen, almost ere the ink was dry, were
there found <hi>Syllabarum aucupes,</hi> such as St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> spake of, <hi>qui nes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cire

who thought there could be no greater disparagement un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them, then to seem to be ignorant of any thing, and under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of interpreting obscure places laid gins to entrap the uncaute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;
who taking advantage of the obscurity of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> text, made
the letter of the Gospel of life and peace, the most-forcible instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of mortal quarrel and contention. The growth of which,
the Holy Ghost by the Ministery of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> hath endeavoured to
cut up in the bud, and to strangle in the womb, in this short admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
which but now hath sounded in your eares. <hi>Which the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,</hi>

of Scripture: where we will briefly consider what it is, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114807:32"/>
what causes and motioners it findes in our corrupt understandings.
Secondly the persons guilty of this offence, discipher'd unto us in
two Epithets, <hi>unlearned, unstable.</hi> Last of all the danger in the last
words, <hi>unto their own damnation.</hi> And first of the sin it self, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

deal with natural bodies, torturing them to extract that out of
them which God and nature never put in them. Scripture is a rule
which will not fit it self to the obliquity of our conceits, but our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
and crooked discourse, must fit it self to the straightness of
that rule. A learned writer in the age of our fathers, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
upon Scripture spake most truly when he said,<note place="margin">F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     <hi>that
his Comments gave no light unto the text, the text gave light unto his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
Other expositions may give rules and directions for under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
their authors, but Scripture gives rules to exposition it self,
and interprets the interpreter. Wherefore when we made in
Scripture, <hi>non pro sententia divinarum Scripturarum,</hi> as St. Austine
speaks, <hi>sed pro nostra ita dimicantes ut tan velimus Scripturarum esse
quae nostra est:</hi> When we strive to give unto it, and not to receive
from it the sense: when we factiously contend to fasten our conceits
upon God: and like the Harlot in the book of Kings, take our dead
and putrified fancies, and lay them in the bosome of Scripture as of
a mother, then are we guilty of this great sin of wresting of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
The nature of which will the better appear, if we consider
a little, some of those motioners which drive us upon it. One ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
potent and strong mean is the exceeding affection and love unto
our own opinions and conceits. For grown we are unro extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
on both hands: we cannot with patience either admit of other
mens opinions, or endure that our own should be withstood. As
it was in the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> army, almost all were Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains:
so in these disputes all will be leaders: and we
take our selves to be much discountenanced, if others think not as we
do.<note place="margin">Schol. in Thucyd.</note> So that the complaint which one makes, concerning the
dissention of Physicians about the diseases of our bodies, is true
likewise in these disputes which concern the cure of our souls, <hi>hinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illae
circa aegros miserae sententiarum concertationes, nullo idem
censente, ne videatur accessio alterius.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Flinie.</note> From hence have sprong
those miserable contentions about the distemper of our souls, sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114807:33"/>
alone, and that we will not seem to stand as cyphers to
make up the summe of other mens opinions, being cause enough
to make us disagree. A fault anciently amongst the Christians so
apparant, that it needed not an Apostolical spirit to discover it, the
very heathen themselves to our shame and confusion, have justly,
judiciously, and sharply taxt us for it. <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus</hi>
passing his censure upon <hi>Constantius</hi> the Emperour: <hi>Christianam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionem
absolutam &amp; simplicem</hi> (saith he: and they are words very
well worth your marking) <hi>Christianam religionem absolutam &amp; sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicem

The Christian religion, a religion of great simplicity and
perfection, he troubled with dotage and superstition. For going
about rather perplexedly to search the controversies, then gravely
to compose them, he raised great stirs, and by disputing spread
them far and wide, whilst he went about to make himself sole
Lord and commander of the whole profession. Now (that it may
appear wherefore I have noted this) it is no hard thing for a man
that hath wit, and is strongly possest of an opinion, and resolute to
maintain it, to finde some places of Scripture, which by good
handling will be woed to cast a favourable countenance upon it.
<hi>Pythagoras</hi> Schollers having been bred up in the doctrine of numbers,
when afterward they diverted upon the studies of nature, fancied
unto themselves somewhat in natural bodies like unto numbers, and
thereupon fell into a conceit that numbers were the principles of
them. So fares it with him that to the reading of Scripture comes
forepossest with some opinion. As <hi>Antipheron Orietes</hi> in Aristotle
thought that every where he saw his own shape and picture going
afore him: so in divers parts of Scripture where these men walk,
they will easily perswade themselves that they see the image of
their own conceits. It was, and is to this day, a fashion in the
hotter countreys, at noon, when the sun is in his strength, to retire
themselves to their Closets or beds, if they were at home, to cool
and shady places if they were abroad, to avoid the inconvenience of
the heat of it. To this the Spouse in the Canticles alluding, calls
after her beloved, as after a shepherd: <hi>Shew me, O thou whom my
soul loveth, where thou feedest thy flock, where thou dost rest at noon.</hi> The
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114807:33"/>
                     <hi>Donatists</hi> conceiting unto themselves that the Church was shut up in
them alone; being urged by the fathers to shew how the Church
being universal, came on a sudden thus to be confinde to Africk:
they had presently their Scripture for it: for so they found it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in the Canticles: <hi>Indica, quem diligit anima mea, ubi pascas, ubi
cubes in meridie.</hi> In which text, <hi>meridies</hi> doubtless as they thought,
was their Southern countrie of Africk, where the shepherd of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el
was, and no where else, to feed his flocks. I may not trouble
you with instances in this kinde: little observation is able to furnish
the man of slendrest reading with abundance. The texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
which are especially subject to this abuse, are those that are of
ambiguous and doubtful meaning. For as <hi>Thucydides</hi> observes of
the fat and fertile places of Greece, that they were evermore the
occasions of stirs and seditions; the neighbouring nations every one
striving to make it self Lord of them: so is it with these places that
are so fertile, as it were, of interpretation, and yield a multiplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of sense: they are the <hi>Palaestra</hi> for good wits to prove masteries in,
where every one desires to be Lord and absolute.</p>
                  <p>A second thing occasioning us to transgress against Scripture, and
the discreet and sober handling of it, is our too quick and speedy
entrance upon the practise of interpreting it, in our young and green
years, before that time and experience have ripened us and setled
our conceits. For that which in all other business, and here like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
doth most especially commend us, is our cautelous and wary
handling it. But this is a flower seldome seen in youths garden.
<hi>Aristotle</hi> differencing age and youth, makes it a property of youth,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> to suppose they know all
things and to be bold in affirming: and the heathen Rhetorician
could tell us, that by this so speedy entring upon action, and so
timely venting our crude and unconcocted studies, <hi>quod est ubique
perniciosissimum, praevenit vires fiducia,</hi> a thing which in all cases is
most pernicious, presumption is greater then strength, after the
manner of those, who are lately recovered out of some great sickness,
in whom appetite is stronger then digestion. These are they who take
the greatest mysteries of Christian religion to be the fittest argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to spend themselves upon. So <hi>Eckius</hi> in his <hi>Chrysopassus,</hi> a
work of his so termed, wherein he discusses the question of predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
in the very entrance of his work tells us, that he therefore
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114807:34"/>
enterpris'd to handle this argument, because forsooth he thought it
to be the fittest question in which he might <hi>Juveniles calores exercere.</hi>
The ancient Masters of fence amongst the Romans were wont to set
up a post, and cause their young Schollers to practise upon it, and
to foin and fight with it, as with an adversary. Insteed of a post,
this young fencer hath set himself up one of the deepest mysteries of
our profession to practise his freshmanship upon. Which quality
when once it findes Scripture for his object, how great inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
it brings with it, needs no large discourse to prove. St. <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi>
a man not too easily brought on to acknowledge the errours
of his writings, amongst those few things which he doth retract,
censures nothing so sharply as the mistake of his youth in this kinde.
<hi>In adolescentia provocatus ardore &amp; studio Scripturarum, allegoricè inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretatus
sum Abdiam Prophetam, cujus historiam nesciebam.</hi> He thought
it one of the greatest sins of his youth, that being carried away
through an inconsiderate heat in his studies of Scripture, he adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
to interpret <hi>Abdias</hi> the Prophet allegorically, when as yet he
knew not the historical meaning. Old men, saith our best natural
master, by reason of the experience of their often mistakes, are
hardly brought constantly to affirm any thing, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
they will always caute<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

speeches, with <hi>it may bees,</hi> and <hi>peradventures,</hi> and other such par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of wariness and circumspection. This old mens modesty of
all other things best fits us in perusing those hard and obscure texts
of holy Scripture. Out of which conceit it is that we see St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
in his books <hi>de Genesi ad literam,</hi> to have written only by way
of questions and interrogations, after the manner of <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his
Problemes, <hi>that he might not,</hi> (for so he gives his reason, <hi>by being
over positive prejudice others, and peradventure truer interpretations:
that every one might choose according to his likeing, &amp; ubi quid intellige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
non potest, Scripturae Dei det honorem, sibi timorem:</hi> and where his
understanding cannot attain unto the sense of it, let him give that
honour and reverence which is due unto the Scripture, and carry
himself with that aw and respect which befits him. Wherefore
not without especial providence it is, that the Holy Ghost by St.

more: so is it as true in those who have lately attaind to some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
and mediocrity of knowledge. Look what infirmities learned
men have, the same have they in greater degree, and many more
besides. Wherefore if <hi>Hippocrates</hi> in his Physician required these
two things, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> great industry and long
experience, the one as tillage to sow the seed, the other as time and

much the more are these two required in the spirituall Physician, by
how much he is the Physician to a more excellent part.</p>
                  <p>I will add yet one third motioner to this abuse of Scriptures, and
that is the too great presumption upon the strength &amp; subtilty of our
own wits. That w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Roman Priest somtimes told an over pleasant,
and witty vestal Virgin, <hi>Coli Deos sanctè magis quam scitè,</hi> hath in this
great work of exposition of Scripture an especial place. The holy
things of God must be handled <hi>sanctè, magis quàm sci è,</hi> with fear
and reverence, not with wit and daliance. The dangerous effects of
this have appeared, not in the green tree only, in young heads, but
in men of constant age, and great place in the Church. For this
was that which undid <hi>Origen,</hi> a man of as great learning and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry,
as ever the Church had any; whilst in sublimity of his wit, in
his Comments on Scripture, conceiving Meteors and airy specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
he brought forth those dangerous errors, which drew upon his
person the Churches heaviest censure; and upon posterity the loss
of his works. Subtil witted men in nothing so much miscarry as
in the too much pleasing themselves in the goodness of their own
conceits; where the like sometimes befals them which befel <hi>X<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

the Painter, who having to the life pictured an old woman, so pleas'd
himself with the conceit of his work that he died with laughing at
it. <hi>Heliodor</hi> Bishop of <hi>Tricca</hi> in <hi>Thessaly,</hi> the Author of
the <hi>AEthiopick story,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nicephorus.</note> a polite and elegant I consess, but a
loose and wanton work, being summon'd by a Provincial Synod,
was told, that which was true, that his work did rather endanger
the manners then profit the wits of his Reader, as nourishing loose
and wanton conceits in the heads of youth: and having his choice
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114807:35"/>
given him either to abolish his work, or to leave his Bishoprick;
not willing to loose the reputation of wit, chose rather to resign his
place in the Church, and, as I verily think, his part in Heaven. And
not in private persons alone, but even in whole nations, shall we
finde remarkable examples of miscarriage in this kind. The Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
till barbarism began to steal in upon them, were men of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous
subtlety of wit, and naturally over indulgent unto themselves
in this quality. Those deep and subtil heresies concerning the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
the Divinity of Christ and of the holy Ghost, the Union and
Division of the Divine Substance and Persons, were all of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
in the heat of their wits; yea, by the strength of them were
they conceived, and born and brought to that growth, that if it had
been possible for the gates of Hell to prevail against the Church,
they would have prevailed this way. Wherefore as God dealt with
his own land, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> being sometimes the mirrour of the world for fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility
and abundance of all things, now lies subject to many curses,
and especially to that of barrenness: so at this day is it with Greece
Where sometimes was the flow and luxury of wit, now is there no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but extream barbarism and stupidity. It is in this respect so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated,
that it scarsly for some hundreth of years hath brought
forth a childe that carries any shew of his Fathers countenance.
God as it were purposely plaguing their miserable posterity with
extream want of that, the abundance of which their fathers did so
wantonly abuse. The reason of all, that hitherto I have in this point
delivered, is this, Sharpness of wit hath commonly with it two ill
companions, pride, and levity. By the first it comes to pass that
men know not how to yield to another mans reasonable positions;
by the second, they know not how to keep themselves constant to
their own. It was an excellent observation of the wise Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,<note place="margin">Thu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>Great wits, hot and fiery dispositions have raised these tumults. From these

                  <p>The persons are noted unto us in two Epithets, <hi>unlearned, unstable.</hi>
First, <hi>unlearned,</hi> It was Sain <hi>Jeroms</hi> complaint, that practitioners of

Profession, <hi>Sola Scripturarum ars est, quam sibi omnes passim vendicant.

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
(so <hi>Nazianzen</hi> speaks) as if this great mystery of Christianity were
but some one of the common, base, inferior, and contemptible
trades. I speak not this as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

                     </gap>sie: but onely that all kinde of men
may know their bounds, that no unlearned beast touch the hill, least
he be thrust through with a dart. It is true which we have heard,
<hi>surgunt indocti &amp; rapiunt regnum coelorum:</hi> they arise indeed, but it
is as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaks of the resurrection, <hi>every man in his own or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</hi>
Scripture is given to all, to learn: but to teach, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret,
onely to a few. This bold intrusion therefore of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
into the chair of the teacher, is that which here with our
blessed Apostle I am to reprehend. <hi>Learning</hi> in general is nothing
else but the competent skill of any man in whatsoever he professes.
Usually we call by this name onely our polite and Academical stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies:
but indeed it is common to <hi>every one, that is well</hi> skild, well pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114807:36"/>
in his own mystery. The unlearned therefore, whom here
our Apostle rebukes, is not he that hath not read a multiplicity of
Authors: or that is not as Moses was, skilful in all the learning of
the AEgyptians: but he that taking upon him to divide the word of
God, is yet but raw and unexperienced; or if he have had experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
wants judgment to make use of it. Scripture is never so unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
as when it falls into these mens fingers. That which old <hi>Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>o</hi>
said of the Grecian Physicians, <hi>quandocunque ista gens literas suas da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
omnia corrumpet,</hi> is most true of these men; whensoever they
shall begin to tamper with Scripture, and vent in writing their raw
conceits, they will corrupt and defile all they touch. <hi>Quid enim

S. <hi>Austine</hi> complaineth: <hi>for what trouble and anguish
these rash presumers</hi> (saith he) <hi>bring unto the discreeter sort of the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
cannot sufficiently be exprest: when being convinced of their rotten
and ungrounded opinions; for the maintaining of that which with great
levity and open falshood they have averd, they pretend the authority of these
sacred books, and repeat much of them even by heart, as bearing witness to
what they hold: whereas indeed they do but pronounce the words, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
not either what they speak, or of what things they do affirm.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
as he that bought <hi>Orpheus</hi> Harp, thought it would of it self
make admirable melody, how unskilfully soever he toucht it: so
these men suppose that Scripture will found wonderful musically,
if they do but strike it, with how great infelicity or incongruity so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be. The reason of these mens offence against Scripture, is
the same with the cause of their miscarriage in civil actions,

<hi>Rude men, men of little experience, are commonly most peremptory: but
men experienced, and such as have Waded in business, are slow of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.
Quintilian</hi> making a question, why unlearned men seem
many times to be more copious then the learned (for commonly
such men never want matter of discourse) answers that it is because
whatsoever conceit comes into their heads, without care or choice
they broach it, <hi>cum doctis sit electio &amp; modus:</hi> whereas learned men
are choice in their invention, and lay by much of that which offers
it self. <hi>Wise hearted men, in whom the Lord hath put wisdom and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the
sanctuary,</hi> like <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab</hi> refuse much of the stuff which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114807:36"/>
is presented them. But this kinde of men whom here our Apostle
notes, are naturally men of bold and daring spirits, <hi>quicquid dixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint,
hoc legem Dei putant,</hi> as Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> speaks, whatsoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
is begotten in their heads, the <hi>spirit</hi> of God is presently
the father of it: <hi>Nee scire dignantur quid Prophetae, quid A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postoli
senserint, sed ad suum sensum incongrua aptant testimonia.</hi>
But to leave these men, and to speak a little more home unto mine
own auditory: Let us a little consider, not the weakness of these
men but the greatness of the business, the manage of which they
undertake. So great a thing as the skill of exposition of the word
and Gospel is, so fraught with multiplicity of Authors, so full of
variety of opinion, must needs be confest to be a matter of great
learning, and that it cannot, especially in our days, in short time
with a mediocrity of industry be attained. For if in the Apostles
times, when as yet much of Scripture was scarsly written, when
God wrought with men miraculously to inform their understanding
and supplied by revelation what mans industry could not yield; if
I say in these times St. <hi>Paul</hi> required <hi>diligent reading,</hi> and expresly
forbad greenness of schollarship: much more then are these condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
required in our times, wherein God doth not supply by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
our natural defects, and yet the burden of our profession is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
increast. All that was necessary in the Apostles times is
now necessary and much more. For if we adde unto the growth of
Christian learning, as it was in the Apostles times, but this one
circumstance (to say nothing of all the rest) which naturally befals
our times, and could not be required at the hands of those who
guided the first ages of the Church: that is, the knowledge of the
state and succession of doctrine in the Church from time to time; a
thing very necessary for the determining the controversies of these
our days: how great a portion of our labour and industry would
this alone require? Wherefore if <hi>Quintilian</hi> thought it necessary to
admonish young men that they should not presume themselves <hi>satis
instructos, si quem ex iis, qui breves circumferuntur, artis libellum edidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerint,
&amp; velut decretis technicorum tutos putent:</hi> if he thought fit thus
to do in an art of so inferiour and narrow a sphere; much more is
it behooveful that young students in so high, so spacious, so large
a profession, be advised nor to think themselves sufficiently provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
upon their acquaintance with some <hi>Notitia,</hi> or Systeme of some
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114807:37"/>
technical divine. Look upon those sons of <hi>Anak,</hi> those Giant-like
voluminous writers of Rome; in regard of whom our little tractats
and pocket volumes in this kinde, what are they but as <hi>Grashoppers?</hi>
I speak not this like some seditious or factious spie, to bring weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of hands, or melting of heart upon any of Gods people: but
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> to stir up and kindle in you the spirit of industry
to inlarge your conceits, and not to suffer your labours to be copst
and mued up within the poverty of some pretended method. I will
speak as <hi>Joshua</hi> did to his people, <hi>Let us not fear the people of that land,
they are as meat unto us, their shadow is departed from them: the Lord is
with us, fear them not.</hi> Only let us not think, <hi>sedendo &amp; votis debella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri posse,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Livie</note> that the conquest will be gotten by sitting still and
wishing all were well: or that the walls of these strong Cities,
will fall down, if we only walk about them, and blow rams horns.
But as the voice of Gods people sometime was, <hi>by the sword of God
and of Gideon,</hi> so that which here gives the victory must be the grace
of God and our industry. For by this circumcised, narrow and
penurious form of study, we shall be no more able to keep pace
with them, then a childe can with <hi>Hercules.</hi> but I forbear and pass
away unto the second epithet, by which these rackers of Scriptures,
are by St. <hi>Peter</hi> stiled <hi>Vastable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN the learning which the world teaches, it were almost a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
to finde a man constant to his own tenents. For not to doubt
in things in which we are conversant, is either by reason of excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
and serenity of understanding throughly apprehending the main
principles on which all things are grounded, together with the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crying
of the several passages from them unto particular conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and the diverticles and blind by-paths which Sophistry and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
are wont to tread: and such a man can nature never yield: or
else it is through a senseless stupidity, like unto that in the common
sort of men, who conversing among the creatures, and beholding
the course of heaven, and the heavenly host, yet never attend them,
neither ever sinks it into their heads to marvel, or question these
things so full of doubt and difficulty. Even such a one is he, that
learns Theology in the School of nature, if he seem to participate
of any setledness or composedness of conscience. Either it never
comes into his head to doubt of any of those things, with which the
world hath inured him: or if it doth, it is to no great purpose, he
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114807:37"/>
may smother and strangle, he can never resolve his doubt. The
reason of which is this. It lies not in the worlds power to give in
this case a text of sufficient authority to compose and fix the thoughts
of a soul, that is dispos'd to doubt. But this great inconvenience
which held the world in uncertainty, by the providence of God is
prevented in the Church. For unto it is left a certain, undoubted,
and sufficient authority, able to exalt every valley, and lay low eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
hill, to smooth all rubs, and make our way so open and passable,
that little enquiry serves. So that as it were a wonder in the school
of nature to finde one setled and resolved: so might it seem a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
that in the Church any man is unstable, unresolved. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
even here is the unstable man found too, and to his
charge the Apostle lays this sin of wresting of Scripture. For since
that it is confest at all hands, that the <hi>sense</hi> and meaning of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is the rule and ground of our Christian tenents, whensoever we
alter them, we must needs give a new sense unto the word of God.
So that the man that is unstable in his religion can never be free
from violating of Scripture. The especial cause of this levity and
flitting disposition in the common and ordinary sort of men, is their
disability to discern of the strength of such reasons, as may be fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
against them. For which cause they usually start, and many
times falls away, upon every objection that is made. In which too
sudden entertainment of objections, they resemble the state of those,
who are lately recovered out of some long sickness, <hi>qui et si
reliquias effugerint, suspicionibus tamen inquietantur,<note place="margin">Seneca</note> &amp; omnem</hi>

To bring these men therefore unto an <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and to purchase them
a setledness of minde; that temper that St. <hi>Austine</hi> doth require
in him that reads his book, <hi>tales meorum Scriptorem velim judices, qui
responsionem non semper desiderent, quum his quae leguntur audierint ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid
contradici:</hi> the same temper must be found in every reader of
Scripture, he must not be at a stand and require an answer to every
objection that is made against them. For as the Philosopher tells
us that mad and fantastical men, are very apprehensive of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
accidents, because their soul is inwardly empty and unfurnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of any thing of worth which might hold the inward attention of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114807:38"/>
their mindes: so when we are so easily dord and amated with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Sophisme, it is a certain argument of great defect of inward fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture
and worth, which should as it were ballance the minde and
keep it upright against all outward occurrents whatsoever. And
be it that many times the means to open such doubts be not at hand,
yet as S. <hi>Austine</hi> sometime spake unto his Scholler <hi>Licentius</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
such advice and counsel as he had given him: <hi>Nolo te causas
rationesque rimari, quae etiamsi reddi possint, sidei tamen, qua mihi cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis
non eas debeo:</hi> so much more must we thus resolve of those
lessons which God teacheth us: the reasons and grounds of them,
though they might be given, yet it fits not that credit and trust
which we owe him, once to search into, or call in question. And
so I come to the third general part, the danger of wresting of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
in the last words, <hi>unto their own damnation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The reward of every sin is death. As the worm eats out the
heart of the plant that bred it: so whatsoever is done amiss natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
works no other end, but destruction of him that doth it. As
this is true in general, so is it as true, that when the Scripture doth
precisely note out unto us some sin, and threatens death unto it, it is
commonly an argument, that there is more then ordinary, that
there is some especial sin, which shall draw with it some especial
punishment. This sin of wresting of Scripture in the eye of some
of the ancients seemed so ougly, that they have ranged it in the
same rank with the sin against the holy Ghost. And therefore
have they pronounced it a sin, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
greater then can be pardoned.<note place="margin">Isidorus Pelusiota.</note> For the most part of
other sins, are sins of infirmity or simplicity, but this is a sin of wit
and strength. The man that doth it, doth it with a high hand; he
knows, and sees, and resolves upon it. Again, Scripture is the
voice of God: and it is confest by all that the sense is Scripture,
rather then the words. It cannot therefore be avoided, but he that
wilfully strives to fasten some sense of his own upon it, other then
the very nature of the place will bear, must needs take upon him the
Person of God, and become a new inditer of Scripture: and all
that applaud and give consent unto any such, in effect cry the same
that the people did to Herod, <hi>the voice of God, and not of man.</hi> If
he then that abases the Princes coin deserves to die, what is his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert

saith the Apostle. There can therefore be but two certain
and infallible interpreters of Scripture: either it self; or the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghost the Author of it. It self doth then expound it self, when
the words and circumstances do sound unto us the prime, and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
and principal sense. But when the place is obscure, involved
and intricate, or when there is contained some secret and hidden
mystery, beyond the prime sense; infallibly to shew us this, there
can be no Interpreter but the holy Ghost that gave it. Besides these
<hi>two,</hi> all other Interpretation is private. Wherefore as the
Lords of the Philistines sometimes said of the kine that drew the
Ark unto <hi>Bethshemesh; If they go of themselves, then is this from
God; but if they go another way, then is it not from God, it is some
chance that hath happened unto us:</hi> so may it be said of all pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
sense of Scripture. If Scripture come unto it of it self, then is
it of God: but if it go another way, or if it be violently urged
and goaded on, then is it but a matter of chance, of mans wit and
invention. As for those marvellous discourses of some, framed
upon presumption of the <hi>spirits</hi> help in private, in judging or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
of difficult places of Scripture, I must needs confess I
have often wondred at the boldness of them. The <hi>spirit</hi> is a thing
of dark and secret operation, the manner of it none can descry. As
underminers are never seen till they have wrought their purpose; so
the spirit is never perceived but by its effects. The effects of the
spirit (as far as they concern knowledge and instruction) are not
particular Information for resolution in any doubtful case (for this
were plainly revelation) but as the Angel, which was sent unto <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius,</hi>
informs him not, but sends him to <hi>Peter</hi> to School: so the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
teaches not, but stirs up in us a desire to learn: Desire to learn
makes us thirst after the means: and pious sedulity and carefulness
makes us watchful in the choice, and diligent in the use of our
means. The promise to the Apostles of the Spirit which should
lead them into all truth, was made good unto them by private and
secret informing their understandings, with the knowledge of high
and heavenly mysteries, which as yet had never entred into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of any man. The same promise is made to us, but fulfilled
after another manner. For what was written by revelation in their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114807:39"/>
hearts, for our instruction have they written in their books. To us
for information, otherwise then out of these books, the spirit
speaks not. When the spirit regenerates a man, it infuses no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of any point of faith, but sends him to the Church and to the
Scriptures. When it stirs him up to newness of life, it exhibits not
unto him an inventory of his sins, as hitherto unknown; but either
supposes them known in the law of nature, of which no man can be
ignorant; or sends him to learn them from the mouth of his teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.
More then this in the ordinary proceeding of the holy spirit,
in matter of instruction. I yet could never descrie. So that to speak
of the help of the <hi>spirit</hi> in private, either in dijudicating, or in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
of Scripture, is to speak they know not what. Which I
do the rather note, first, because by experience we have learnt,
how apt men are to call their private conceits, the spirit: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
because it is the especial errour, with which S. <hi>Austine</hi> long
agoe charged this kinde of men: <hi>tanto sunt ad seditionem faciliores,
quanto sibi videntur spiritu excellere:</hi> by so much the more prone are
they to kindle schisme and contention in the Church, by how much
they seem to themselves to be endued with a more eminent measure
of spirit then their brethren; whilst <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (as St. <hi>Basils</hi> speaks) <hi>under pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ense of interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
they violently broach their own conceits.</hi> Great then is the danger
in which they wade, which take upon them this business of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation.
<hi>temeritas asserendae incertae dubiaeque opinionis,</hi> saith St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine,
difficile sacrilegii crimen evitat:</hi> the rashness of those that aver
uncertain and doubtful interpretations for Catholick and absolute,
can hardly escape the sin of sacrilege.</p>
                  <p>But whereas our Apostle saith, <hi>their own destruction,</hi> is the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
only their own? This were well if it stretched no farther.
The ancients much complain of this offence, as an hinderer of the
salvation of others. There were in the days of <hi>Istdorus Pelusiota</hi>
some that gave out that all in the old Testament was spoken of
Christ: belike out of extream opposition to the <hi>Manichees,</hi> who on
the otherside taught, that no text in the old Testament did foretel of
Christ. That Father therefore dealing with some of that opinion,
tells them how great the danger of their tenent is. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>for if,</hi> saith he, <hi>we strive with violence to draw and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114807:39"/>
those texts to Christ, which apparantly pertain not to him, we shall gain
nothing but this, to make all the places that are spoken of him suspected;
and so discredit the strength of other testimonies, which the Church usually
urges for the refutation of the Jews.</hi> For in these cases a wrested proof
is like unto a suborn'd witness. It never doth help so much whilest
it is presumed to be strong, as it doth hurt when it is discovered to
be weak. S. <hi>Austine</hi> in his books <hi>de Genesi ad litteram,</hi> sharply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves
some Christians, who out of some places of Scripture mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood,
fram'd unto themselves a kinde of knowledge in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomy
and Physiology, quite contrary unto some part of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
learning in this kinde, which were true and evident unto sense.
A man would think that this were but a small errour, and yet he
doubts not to call it, <hi>turpenimis, &amp; perniciosum &amp; maximè cavendum.</hi>
His reason warrants the roundness of his reproof. For he charges
such to have been a scandal unto the word, and hinderers of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version
of some heathen men that were schollars. <hi>For how,</hi> saith
he, <hi>shall they believe our books of Scripture perswading the resurrection of
the dead, the kingdome of heaven, and the rest of the mysteries of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
if they finde them faulty in these things, of which themselves have
undeniable demonstration?</hi> Yea though the cause we maintain be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so good, yet the issue of diseas'd and crazie proofs brought to
maintain it, must needs be the same. For unto all causes, be they
never so good, weakness of proof, when it is discovered, brings
great prejudice, but unto the cause of religion most of all. St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
observ'd that there were some <hi>qui cum de aliquibus, qui sanctum
nomen profitentur aliquid criminis vel falsi sonuerit, vel veri patuerit,
instant, satagunt, ambiunt ut de omnibus hoc credatur.</hi> It fares no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
with religion it self, then it doth with the professors of it.
Diverse malignants there are, who lie in wait to espie where our
reasons on which we build are weak, and having deprehended it in
some, will earnestly solicit the world to believe that all are so, if
means were made to bring it to light: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> speaks: using for advantage against us no strength of
their own, but the vice and imbecillity of our defence. The book
of the Revelation is a book full of wonder and mystery: the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
seem to have made a religion to meddle with it, and thought
it much better to admire it with silence, then to adventure to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114807:40"/>
it: and therefore amongst their labours in exposition of
Scripture, scarsly is there any one found that hath toucht it. But
our age hath taken better heart. and scarsly any one is there who
hath entertained a good conceit of his own abilities, but he hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
that book as a fit argument to spend his pains on. That the
Church of Rome hath great cause to suspect her self, to fear least
she have a great part in the prophesies of that book, I think the most
partial will not deny. Yet unto the expositors of it, I will give this
advice, that they look that that befal not them, which <hi>Thucidides</hi>
observes to befal the common sort of men: who though they have
good means to acquit themselves like men, yet when they think
their best hopes fail them, and begin to despair of their strength,
comfort themselves with interpretations of certain dark and obscure
prophesies. Many plain texts of Scripture are very pregnant, and
of sufficient strength to overthrow the points maintained by that
Church against us. If we leave these, &amp; ground our selves upon our
private expositions of this book, we shall justly seem in the pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of better proofs, to rest our selves upon those prophesies;
which, though in themselves they are most certain, yet our expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
of them must, (except God give yet further light unto his
Church) necessarily be mixt with much uncertainty, as being at the
best but unprobable conjectures of our own. Scarsly can there be
found a thing more harmful to religion, then to vent thus our own
conceits, and obtrude them upon the world for necessary and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute.
The Physicians skill as I conceive of it, stands as much on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
as any that I know, whatsoever. Yet their greatest master
<hi>Hippocrates</hi> tells them directly: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> &amp;c.
<hi>Then the Physicians presumption upon opinion, there is not one thing that
brings either more blame to himself or danger to his patient.</hi> If it be thus
in an art which opinion taken away, must needs fall; how little
room then must opinion have in that knowledge, where nothing
can have place but what is of eternal truth? Where if once we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of opinion all is overthrown? But I conclude this point, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
only this general admonition, that we be not too peremptory
in our positions, where express text of Scripture fails us: that we
lay not our own collections and conclusions with too much precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy.
For experience hath shewed us, that the error and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of them being afterwards discovered brings great disadvantage
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114807:40"/>
to Christianity, and trouble to the Church. The Eastern Church
before S. <hi>Basils</hi> time, had entertained generally a conceit, that
that those Greek Particles, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> and the rest, were so
divided among the Trinity, that each of the Persons had his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
which was no way appliable to the rest. S. <hi>Basil</hi> having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
this to be but a niceness and needless curiosity, beginning to
teach so, raised in the Church such a tumult, that he brought upon
himself a great labour of writing many tracts in Apology for
himself, with much ado, ere matters could again be setled. The
fault of this was not in <hi>Basil,</hi> who Religiously fearing what by way
of consequence might ensue upon an error, taught a truth; but in
the Church, who formerly had with too much facility admitted a
conclusion so justly subject to exception. And let this suffice for our third part.</p>
                  <p>Now because it is apparant that the end of this our Apostles ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition
is to give the Church a caveat how she behave her self in
handling of Scripture, give me leave a little, instead of the use of
such doctrines as I have formerly laid down, to shew you, as far as
my conceit can stretch, what course any man may take to save him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from offering violence unto Scripture, and reasonably settle
himself, any pretended obscurity of the text whatsoever notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
For which purpose the diligent observing of two rules
shall be throughly available. First, <hi>The literal, plain, and uncontro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versable
meaning of Scripture without any addition or supply by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation,
is that alone which for ground of faith we are necessarily
bound to accept, except it be there where the holy Ghost himself treads us
out another way.</hi> I take not this to be any peculiar conceit of mine,
but that unto which our Church stands necessarily bound. When
we receded from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> one motive was, because
she added unto Scripture her glosses as Canonical, to supply what
the plain text of Scripture could not yield. If in place of hers,
we set up our own glosses, thus to do, were nothing else but to pull
down Baal, and set up an Ephod; to run round, and meet the
Church of Rome again in the same point, in which at first we left
her. But the plain, evident and demonstrative ground of this rule,
is this. That authority which doth warrant our faith unto us, must
every way be free from all possibility of errour. For let us but
once admit of this, that there is any possibility that any one point
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114807:41"/>
of faith should not be true; if it be once granted that I may be
deceived in what I have believed; how can I be assur'd that in the
end I shall not be deceived? If the author of faith may alter: or
if the evidence and assurance that he hath left us be not pregnant,
and impossible to be defeated, there is necessarily opened an inlet
to doubtfulness and wavering, which the nature of faith excludes.
That faith therefore may stand unshaken, two things are of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
to concur. First, that the Author of it be such a one, as can
by no means be deceived, and this can be none but God. Secondly,
that the words and text of this Author upon whom we ground,
must admit of no ambiguity, no uncertainty of interpretation.
<hi>If the trumpet give an uncertain sound, who shall provide himself to
battle.</hi> If the words admit a double sense, and I follow one, who
can assure me that that which I follow is the truth? For infallibility
either in judgement, or interpretation, or whatsoever, is annext
neither to the See of any Bishop, nor to the Fathers, nor to the
Councels, nor to the Church, nor to any created power whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
This doctrine of the literal sense was never greivous or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial
to any, but onely to those who were inwardly conscious,
that their positions were not sufficiently grounded. When <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Cajetan</hi> in the days of our grandfathers had forsaken that vein
of postilling and allegorising on Scripture, which for a long time
had prevailed in the Church, and betaken himself unto the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
sense: it was a thing so distastful unto the Church of Rome,
that he was forc'd to find out many shifts, and make many apologies
for himself. The truth is (as it will appear to him that reads his
writings) this sticking close to the literal sense was that alone,
which made him to shake many of those tenents, upon which the
Church of Rome and the Reformed Churches differ. But when
the importunity of the Reformers, and the great credit of <hi>Calvins</hi>
writings in that kinde, had forced the Divines of Rome to level
their interpretations by the same line: when they saw that no pains,
no subtlety of wit was strong enough to defeat the literal evidence
of Scripture: it drave them on those desperate shelves, on which
at this day they stick, to call in question, as far as they durst, the
credit of the Hebrew text, and countenance against it a corrupt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation;
to add traditions unto Scripture; and to make the Churches
interpretation, so pretended, to be above exception. As for that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114807:41"/>
restriction which is usually added to this rule, that the literal sense
is to be taken, if no absurdity follow, though I acknowledge it to
be sound and good, yet my advise is that we entertain it warily.
S. <hi>Basil</hi> thought the precept of Christ to the rich man in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
<hi>Go sell all thou hast and give unto the poor,</hi> to be spoken as
a command universally and eternally binding all Christians with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exception. And making this objection, how possibly such a
life could be amongst Christians, since where all are sellars, none
could be buyers: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> (saith he) <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> &amp;c.
<hi>Ask not me the sense of my Lords
commands. He that gave the Law, can provide to give it possibility
of being kept without any absurdity at all.</hi> Which speech, howsoever
we may suppose the occasion of it to be mistaken; yet is it of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
use, to repress our boldness, whereby many times, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of some inconvenience, we hinder Scripture from that lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of sense, of which it is naturally capable. You know the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Roman Captain in <hi>Gellius,</hi> and what he told the Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,
that chose rather to interpret, then to execute his Lords
command: <hi>Corrumpi atque dissolvi omne imperantis officium, si quis
ad id quod facere jussus est non obsequio debito, sed consilio non deside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rato
respondeat.</hi> It will certainly in the end prove safer for us to
entertain Gods Commandments <hi>obsequio debito,</hi> then to interpret
them <hi>acumine non desiderato.</hi> Those other ways of interpretation,
whether it be by allegorizing, or allusion or whatsoever, the best
that can be said of them is that which <hi>Basil</hi> hath pronounced:
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.
<hi>We account of them as of trim, elegant, and witty
speeches, but we refuse to accept of them, as of undoubted truths.</hi> And
though of some part of these that may be said which
one said of his own work,<note place="margin">Ausoni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>

                     <hi>quod ad usum lusi, quod ad,
molestiam laboravi,</hi> in respect of any profit comes by them, they
are but sport, but in respect of the pains taken in making of them
they are labor &amp; travel: yet much of them is of excellent use in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate:
either to raise our affections or to spend our meditations, or (so
it be with modesty) to practise our gifts of wit to the honor of him
that gave them. For if we absolutely condemn these interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
then must we condemn a great part of antiquity, who are
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114807:42"/>
very much conversant in this kinde of interpreting. For the most
partial for antiquity cannot chuse but see and confess thus much,
that for the literal sense the Interpreters of our own times, because
of their skill in the Original Languages, their care of pressing the
circumstances and coherence of the text; of comparing like pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of Scripture with like, have generally surpast the best of the
ancients. Which I speak not to discountenance antiquity, but that
all ages, all persons may have their due. And let this suffice for
our first rule.</p>
                  <p>The Jewish <hi>Rabbins</hi> in their Comments on Scripture so oft as
they met with hard and intricate texts, out of which they could
not wrest themselves, were wont to shut up their discourse with
this, <hi>Elias cumvenerit, solvet dubia:</hi> Elias shall answer this doubt
when he comes. Not the Jews only, but the Learned Christians
of all ages have found many things in Scripture which yet expect
<hi>Elias.</hi> For besides those texts of Scriptures, which by reason of
the hidden treasures of wisdom, and depth of sense and mystery
laid up in them, are not yet conceived, there are in Scripture of
things that are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>seemingly confus'd,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
semblance of contrariety, anachronisms, metachronisms,</hi> and the like,
which bring infinite obscurity to the text: there are I say in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
more of them, then in any writing that I know secular or
Divine. If we mean not to settle our selves till all these things are
answered, let us take heed least the like be said to us, which
S. <hi>Austine</hi> said to some of the Gentiles, who refused to believe till
all objections were satisfied <hi>sunt enim innumerabiles quae non sunt fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endae
ante fidem, ne vita finiatur sine fide.</hi> The <hi>Areopagites</hi> in <hi>Athens,</hi>
when they were troubled in a doubtful case in which they durst not
proceed to sentence, were wont <hi>causam in diem longissimam differre,</hi>
to put it off till a day of hearing for some hundreth years after, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding
by this means the further being importun'd with the suit.
To quiet our selves in these doubts it will be our best way <hi>in diem
longissimam differre,</hi> to put them to some day of hearing a far off,
even till that great day, till Christ our true <hi>Elias</hi> shall come, who
at his comming shall answer all our doubts, and settle all our wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings.
Mean while till our <hi>Elias</hi> come, let us make use of this
second rule. <hi>In places of ambiguous and doubtful, or dark and intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
meaning, it is sufficient if we religiously admire and acknowledge and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114807:42"/>
confess: using that moderation of Austine: Neutram partem affirmantes
sive destruentes, sed tantummodo ab audaci affirmandi praesumptione revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantes.
Qui credit,</hi> saith one, <hi>satis est illi quod Christus intelligat.</hi> To
understand belongs to Christ the Author of our Faith: to us is
sufficient the glory of believing. Wherefore we are to advise, not
so much how to attain unto the understanding of the mysteries of
Scripture; as how it best fits us to carry our selves when either the
difficulty of the text, or variety of opinions shall distract us. In
the sixth General Councel <hi>Honorius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> is condemned
for a <hi>Monothelite.</hi> Two Epistles there are of his which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to give evidence against him. For the first I have nothing to
say. For the second (I speak with submission to better judgement)
notwithstanding the sharp proceeding of the Councel against him,
I verily suppose that he gives unto the Church the best Counsel, that
ever yet was given for the setling of doubts, and final decision of
controversie. For that which he teaches in that Epistle, at least in
those parts of it, which there are brought, sounds to no other
purpose but this: <hi>That whereas there was lately raised in the Church a
controversie concerning the duality or unity of wills in Christ; since that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
nothing in the Church concerning either part hath been expresly
taught, his Counsel was that men would rather cease to doubt, then to be cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to search for any solution of their doubtings; and so abstain from
teaching doctrinally either part, and content themselves with that express
measure of faith, with which the Church hath hitherto rest satisfied.</hi> This
to my conceit is the drift of his Epistle. How this advise of the
Bishops was appliable or how it fitted the question then in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie;
or what reason moved the Councel to think that it was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
necessary for them, to give an express decision, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
for the one part, belongs not to me to discuss. But I verily
perswade my self, that if it had pleased those, who in all ages
have been set to Govern the Church of God, betimes to have
made use of this advise, to have taught men rather not to have
doubted, then to have expected still solution of their doubtings:
to have stopt and damm'd up the originals and springs of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies,
rather then by determining for the one part, to give them as
it were a pipe and conduit to conveigh them to posterity, I perswade
my self the Church had not suffered that inundation of opinions,
with which at this day it is overrun. Is it not Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> own pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114807:43"/>
when having brought in a question concerning Gods justice in
predestination, he gives no other answer but this, <hi>O man, who art thou
that disputest with God?</hi> Is it not his plain purpose to advise the dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
rather not to make the question, then to require a determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of it at his hands? How many of the questions even of our own
times, even of those that are at home amongst us, might by this
way long since have been determin'd? I have, I confess, the same
disease that my first Parents in Paradise had, a desire to know
more then I need. But I always thought it a very judicious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation,
which is given to <hi>Julius Agricola,</hi> that he knew how to
bridle his desire in pursuit of knowledge, <hi>retinuitque, quod est dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficillimum,
ex scientia modum. Mallem quidem</hi> (as S. <hi>Austine</hi> saith)

To conclude, S. <hi>Austine</hi> in his eightieth Epistle discoursing of the
speedy or slow coming of our Saviour to judgement, to shew that
it is the safest way to teach neither, but to suspend our belief, and
confess our ignorance, ranging himself with men of this temper,
<hi>obsecro te</hi> (saith he to <hi>Hesychius,</hi> to whom he writes that Epistle)
<hi>obsecro te ut me talem non spernas.</hi> So give me leave to commence
the same suit to you: <hi>obsecro vos ut me talem non spernatis.</hi> Let me
request you bear with me, if I be such a one, as I have S. <hi>Austine</hi>
for example. For it is not depth of knowledge, nor knowledge of
antiquity, or sharpness of wit, nor authority of Councels, nor
the name of the Church can settle the restless conceits, that possess
the mindes of many doubtful Christians: onely to ground for faith
on the plain uncontroversable Text of Scripture, and for the rest
to expect and pray for the coming of our <hi>Elias,</hi> this shall compose
our waverings, and give final rest unto our souls.</p>
                  <p>Thus instead of a discourse which was due unto this time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the glorious Resurrection of our blessed Saviour, and the
benefits that come unto us by it, I have diverted my self upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
theam, more necessary as I thought for this auditory, though
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114807:43"/>
less agreeable with this solemnity. Those who have gone afore
me in that argument have made so copious a harvest, that the
issue of my gatherings must needs have been but small, except
I had with <hi>Ruth</hi> glean'd out of their sheaves, or strain'd my indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
which is but small, and my wits which are none, to have held
your attentiveness with new and quaint conceits. In the mean
time, whether it be I or they, or whatsoever hath been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
out of this place, God grant that it may be for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
and for the Churches good, to whom both it aud we are
dedicate. To God the Father, &amp;c.</p>

(as one speaks) <hi>Commissiones merae, &amp; arena sine calce,</hi> stones
heapt together without morter, or pieces of boards without any

in it, above all other properties, of which our Nature is

                     <hi>Receiving</hi> from others into our selves. All other <hi>Qualities,</hi> how
excellent soever they are, seem to be somewhat of a <hi>melancholick</hi>
and solitary disposition. They shine then brightest, when they
are in some one alone, or attain'd unto by few; once make
them common, and they lose their lustre. But <hi>Goodness</hi> is more
sociable; and rejoyceth in equalling others unto it self, and
loses its Nature, when it ceases to be <hi>communicable.</hi> The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
speaking of God usually stile him by two Attributes. <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus
&amp; Maximus,</hi> the one importing his <hi>goodness,</hi> the other his
<hi>Power.</hi> In the first place they call'd him <hi>Optimus,</hi> a name signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
his <hi>goodness,</hi> giving the <hi>precedency</hi> unto it; and in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
place <hi>Maximus,</hi> a name betokening his <hi>Power:</hi> yea, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is that wherein God himself doth most delight himself; and
therefore all the <hi>Acts</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> while he conversed on earth
among men, were purely the issues of his <hi>tenderness</hi> without any
aspersion of Severity, two only excepted: I mean his <hi>Chasing</hi>
the <hi>Prophaners</hi> out of the <hi>Temple,</hi> and the <hi>Curse</hi> laid upon the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
Fig-tree:</hi> and yet in both these <hi>mercy</hi> rejoyced against judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and his <hi>goodness</hi> had the preheminence. For the first
brought some smart with it indeed, but no harm at all,
as Fathers use to chastise their Children by means that fear them
more then hurt them. The second of it self was nothing, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
practis'd on a Creature dull and senseless of all smart, and
punishment; but was meerly <hi>Exemplary</hi> for us, <hi>sterilitas nostra
in sicu vapulat.</hi> Christ whips our fruitlesness in the innocent fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree;
like as the <hi>Manner</hi> was among the <hi>Persians,</hi> when their
great men had offended, to take their Garments and bear them.
Now that <hi>gracious</hi> way of <hi>goodness</hi> which it pleased our Saviour,
thus to tread himself before us, the same hath he left behinde
him to be gone by us, and hath ordained us a course of <hi>Religious</hi>
and <hi>Christian service</hi> unto him, known by nothing more then
<hi>goodness</hi> and <hi>compassion.</hi> The very <hi>Heathen</hi> themselves, though
utter enemies unto it, have <hi>candidly</hi> afforded us this <hi>Testimony.
Ammianus Marcellinus</hi> taxing <hi>Georgius</hi> a factious and proud Bishop
of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> for abusing the weakness of <hi>Constantius</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
by base tale-bearing and privy informations; notes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely
that he did it, <hi>Oblitus professionis suae, quae nil nisi justum sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>det
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114807:45"/>
&amp; lene;</hi> quite besides the meaning of his profession, whose
especial notes were Gentleness and Equity. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells
us that anciently among the Heathen, the professors of <hi>Christa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>
were called, not <hi>Christiani,</hi> but <hi>Chrestiani,</hi> from a word
signifying <hi>Benignity</hi> and <hi>sweetness</hi> of disposition. The learned of
our times, who for our instruction, have written <hi>de Notis Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae</hi>
by what notes and signes, we may know the Church of <hi>Christ</hi>
may seem to have but ill forgotten, this which the Heathen man
had so clearly discovered. For what reason is there, why that
should not be one of the chiefest notes of the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi>
which did so especially <hi>Characterize</hi> a Christian man, except it
were the decay of it at this day in the Church: of this thing
therefore so excellent in it self, so useful, so principally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by the precept and example of our blessed <hi>Saviour,</hi> one
especial part is, if not the whole, which here by our <hi>Apostle</hi> is
commended unto us, when he speaks unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> of kindly intreating,
&amp; making much of such, who are as he calls them <hi>weak in Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Him that is weak in Faith,</hi> &amp;c. To know the natural
ground and occasion of which words, it shall be very pertinent,
to note unto you, that with the Church of Christ, as it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<hi>a Company of men</hi> on earth, it fares no otherwise, then it doth
with other <hi>Societies,</hi> and civil <hi>Corporations.</hi> One thing there is
unavoidable, and natural to all societies, which is the greatest
occasioner, yea the very ground of disunion and dissent, I mean
<hi>Inequality of persons and degrees.</hi> All are not of the same worth,
and therefore all cannot carry the same esteem and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance:
yet all even the meanest are alike impatient of discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and contempt, be the persons never so great, from
whence it proceeds. Wherefore we finde that in States govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the people nothing did more exasperate the common sort,
then the conceit of being contemned by men of greater place.
For the taking away therefore of <hi>tumult</hi> and <hi>combustion,</hi> which
through this inequality might arise, it was anciently accounted
an excellent policy in the <hi>Romane state,</hi> that men of greater ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
and place, did as it were <hi>share</hi> the <hi>inferiour</hi> sort amongst
themselves, and every one according to his Ability entertain'd
some part of them as <hi>Clyents,</hi> to whom they yielded all lawful
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114807:46"/>
favour and protection. <hi>Even</hi> thus it fares with the <hi>Church</hi> of
God, it cannot be, that all in it should be of equal worth, it is
likewise distinguished into <hi>Plebem</hi> and <hi>Optimates.</hi> Some there
are, and those that either through aboundance of spiritual gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
or else of natural gifts do far out-strip a great part of other
<hi>Christians,</hi> these are the <hi>Optimates,</hi> the Nobles of the Church
whom our Apostle, some where calls <hi>strong men in Christ.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
there are, and those most in number, who either because
God hath not so liberally blest them with gifts of understanding,
and capacity; or by reason of some other imperfections are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
not so deeply skill'd in the mysteries of Christ, and of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness,
or otherwise weak in manners and behaviour, and these
are the <hi>Plebs</hi> the <hi>Many</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> whom our Apostle some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
calls <hi>Brethren of low degree,</hi> sometimes <hi>Babes in Christ,</hi> and
here in my text the <hi>weak and sick in faith.</hi> Men, by nature queru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
and apt to take exception, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
saith <hi>Electra</hi> in the Tragedy. <hi>A sick man is a pettish,
and wayward Creature hard to be pleased;</hi> as therefore with the sick,
so are we now to deal with a <hi>Neighbour</hi> weak and sick of his <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi>
constitution, and much we are to bear with his froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
where we cannot remedy it. For as <hi>Varro</hi> sometimes
spake of the Laws of Wedlock. <hi>Vxoris vitium aut tollendum est
aut ferendum,</hi> either a man must amend, or endure the faults of
his wife, he that amends them makes his <hi>wife</hi> the better, but he
that patiently endures them makes <hi>himself</hi> the better: so is it
much more true in dealing with our weak Brethren, if we can
by our behaviour remedy their imbecillities, we make them the
better, if not, by enduring them we shall make our selves the
better; for so shall we encrease the vertue of our patience, and
purchase to our selves at Gods hand a more aboundant reward.
A great part of the lustre of a <hi>Christian</hi> mans virtue were utterly
obscure, should it want this mean of shewing it self; for were all
men strong, were all of sufficient discretion, to see and judge
of <hi>Conveni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ncy,</hi> where were the glory of our forbearance? As
well therefore to increase the reward of the <hi>strong man</hi> in Christ,
as to stop the <hi>whining and murmuring</hi> of the weaker sort, and to
give content at all hands, our Apostle like a good <hi>Tribune</hi> in this
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114807:46"/>
Text gives a rule of <hi>Christian popularity</hi> advising the man of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier
parts, to avoid all sleighting behaviour, to open the arms
of tenderness and compassion, and to demerit by all courtesie
the men of meaner rank, so to prevent all inconvenience, that
might arise out of disdainful and respectless carriage; for God
is not like unto mortal Princes, jealous of the man whom the
people love. In the world nothing is more dangerous for great
men, then the extraordinary favour, and applause of the people.
Many excellent men have miscarried by it. For Princes stand
much in fear, when any of their subjects hath the heart of the
people. It is one of the commonest grounds upon which Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
is rais'd, <hi>Absolom</hi> had the Art of it, who by being plausible,
by commiserating the peoples wrongs, and wishing the redress;
<hi>O that I were a Judge to do this people good,</hi> by putting out his hand
and imbracing and kissing every one that came <hi>nigh</hi> him, so stole
away the hearts of the people, that he had well-nigh put his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
beside his Kingdom: but what alters and undoes the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
of this world, that strengthens and increases the Kingdom
of God, <hi>Absolom</hi> the popular <hi>Christian,</hi> that hath the art of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
mens souls, and making himself belov'd of the people, is the
best subject in the Kingdom of grace, for this is that which our
Apostle expresses in the phrase of <hi>Receiving the weak.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it falls out oftentimes that men offend through <hi>intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestive
compassion</hi> and tenderness, as much as by over much rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and severity: as much by familiarity, as by supercilious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and contempt. Wherefore even our love and courtesie
must be managed by discretion. St. <hi>Paul</hi> saw this well; and
therefore he prescribes limits to our affections, and having in
the former part of my text counselled us as <hi>Christ did Peter,</hi> to let
<hi>loose our nets,</hi> to make a draught; to do as <hi>Joseph</hi> did in <hi>Egypt,
open our garners</hi> and store-houses, that all may come to buy, to
admit of all, to exclude none, from our indulgence and cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie,
in this second part <hi>But not to doubtful disputations;</hi> he
sets the bounds how far our love must reach. As <hi>Moses</hi> in the
19. of <hi>Exodus,</hi> set bounds about <hi>Mount Sinai,</hi> forbidding the
people, that they go not up to the Hill, or come within the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of it, so hath the Apostle appointed certain limits to our
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114807:47"/>
love and favour, within which it shall not be lawful for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to come. Inlarge we the <hi>Phylacteries</hi> of our goodness as
broad as we list, give we all countenance unto the meaner sort,
admit we them into all inwardness, and familiarity; yet unto
<hi>disputations</hi> and <hi>controversies,</hi> concerning profounder points of
<hi>Faith</hi> and religious mysteries, the meaner sort may be by no
means admitted. For give me leave now to take this for the
meaning of the words: I know they are very capable of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
sense: as if the Apostles counsel had been unto us to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
withal courtesie our weaker brethren, and not overbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
to enquire into, or censure their secret thoughts and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
but here to leave them to themselves, and to God who is
the Judge of thoughts. For many there are, otherwise right
good men, yet weak in judgement, who have fallen upon sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
private conceits, such as are unnecessary <hi>differencing of
meats and drinks,</hi> di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ction of <hi>days</hi> or (to exemplifie my self
in some conceit of our <hi>times</hi>) some singular opinions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Souls departed,</hi> private interpretations of <hi>obscure
Texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and others of the same nature: of these or
the like thoughts, which have taken root in the hearts of men
of shallow capacity, those who are more surely grounded, may
not presume themselves to bee judges, many of these things of
themselves, are harmless, and indifferent, only to him that hath
some prejudicate opinion of them, they are not so, and of these
things they who are thus, or thus conceited shall be accountable
to God, and not to man; to him alone shall they stand or fall.
Wherefore, <hi>bear</hi> (saith the Apostle) with these infirmities, and
take not on you to be Lords of their thoughts, but gently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate
these their unnecessary conceits and scrupulosities. This
though I take to be the more natural meaning of the words, (for
indeed it is the main drift of our Apostles discourse in this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
yet chuse I rather to follow the former interpretation. First,
because of the <hi>Authority</hi> of sundry learned <hi>Interpreters,</hi> and because
it is very requisite that our age should have something said unto
it concerning this over bold intrusion of all sorts of men into the
discussing of doubtful <hi>Disputations.</hi> For <hi>Disputation,</hi> though it be an
excellent help to bring the truth to light, yet many times by to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114807:47"/>
much troubling the waters, it suffers it to slip away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen,
especially with the meaner sort who cannot so easily
espie, when it is mixt with Sophistry and deceit.
<hi>Infirmum autem in side recipite,</hi> but not to <hi>doubtful disputations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This my text therefore is a <hi>Spiritual Regimen</hi> and diet for these
who are of a weak and sickly constitution of minde, and it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
a <hi>Recipe</hi> for a man of crazie and diseased faith. In which by
that which I have delivered, you may plainly see there are two
general parts. First an admonition of courteous entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to be given to the weaker sort in the first words. <hi>Him
that is weak in the Faith receive,</hi> &amp;c. Secondly, the restraint and
bound of this Admonition, how far it is to extend even unto all
Christian offices, excepting only the hearing of <hi>doubtful disputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi>
In the first part we will consider; first, who these weak ones
are of whom the Apostle speaks, and how many kindes of
them there be, and how each of them may be the subject of a
Christian mans goodness and courtesie. Secondly, who these
persons are, to whom this precept of entertaining is given, and
they are two, either, the private man, or the publick Magistrate.
In the second general part we will see what reasons we may
frame to our selves, why these weak ones should not be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to questions and <hi>doubtful disputations.</hi> Which points several<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and by themselves we will not handle, but we will so order
them, that still as we shall have in order discovered some kind of
weak <hi>man,</hi> whom our Apostle would have <hi>received,</hi> we will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
seek how far forth he hath a right to be an hearer of
<hi>sacred</hi> disputation, and this as far only as it concerns a private
man: And for an up-shot in the end, we will briefly consider
by it self, whether, and how far this precept of <hi>bearing</hi> with the
weak pertains to the man of <hi>publick place,</hi> whether in the
Church or in the common-wealth. And first concerning the
<hi>weak,</hi> as he may be a subject of Christian courtesie in private.
And here because, that in comparison of him that is strong in
Christ, every man of what estate soever, may be said to be
weak, the <hi>strong man</hi> only excepted, we will in the number of
the weak contain all persons whatsoever. For I confess, because
I wish well to all, I am willing that all should reap some bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:114807:48"/>
by my text. As therefore the <hi>woman</hi> in the Gospel, who in
touching only the <hi>Hem of Christs garment</hi> did receive vertue to
cure her disease: so all weak persons whatsoever, though they
seem to come behinde, and only touch the <hi>hem</hi> of my text, may
peradventure receive some vertue from it to redress their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
nay, as the <hi>King in the Gospel</hi> that made a <hi>feast,</hi> and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
his servants to go out to the high-wayes side to the blinde,
and the lame, and force them in that his house might be full:
so what lame or weak person soever he be, if I finde him not in
my text, I will go out and force him in, that the doctrine of my
Text may be full, and that the goodness of a Christian man may
be like <hi>the widdows oyle in the book of Kings,</hi> that never ceas'd <hi>running</hi>
so long as there was a vessel to receive it. Wherefore to speak in
general: there is no kinde of man, of what life, of what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
of what estate and calling soever, though he be an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then,
and Idolater, unto whom the skirts of Christian compassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
do not reach. St. <hi>Paul</hi> is my author: <hi>Now whilest you have
time</hi> (saith he) <hi>do good unto all men, but especially to the houshold of
Faith.</hi> The houshold of faith indeed hath the preheminence;
it must be chiefly, but not alone respected. The distinction
that is to be made, is not by excluding any, but not participating
alike unto all, God did sometimes indeed tye his love to the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wish
Nation only, and gave his laws to them alone: but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
he enlarged himself, and instituted an order of serving
him promiscuously capable of all the world. As therefore our
religion is, so must our compassion be, catholick. To tye it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to persons or to place, is but a kinde of <hi>moral Judaisme.</hi> Did
not St. <hi>Paul</hi> teach us, thus much common reason would. There
must of necessity be some free entercourse with all men, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the passages of publick commerce were quite cut of, and
the common law of Nations must needs fall. In some things
we agree, as we are men, and thus far the very heathen them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are to be received. For the goodness of a man which in
<hi>Solomons</hi> judgement, extendeth even to a beast, much more must
stretch it self to a man of the same nature with him, be his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
what it will. St. <hi>Paul</hi> loved the <hi>Jews,</hi> because they were
<hi>his brethren according to the Flesh.</hi> We that are of the <hi>heathen</hi> by
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114807:48"/>
the same same anology ought to be as tenderly affected to the
rest our brethren, who though they be not as we are <hi>now,</hi> yet
now are that which we sometimes were. <hi>Pacile est atque procli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ve,</hi>
saith Austine, <hi>malos odisse quia mali sunt, rarum autem &amp; pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um
eosdem ipsos diligere, quia homines sunt,</hi> It is an easie thing to hate
<hi>evil men,</hi> because they are evil, but to love them as they are <hi>men</hi>
this is a rare and a pious thing. The offices of common hospitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
of helping distressed persons, feeding the hungry, and the
like are due not only betwixt Christian and Christian, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a Christian and all the world. <hi>Lot, when the Angels came
to Sodom, and sate in the streets: Abraham</hi> when he saw <hi>three men</hi>
coming toward him stood not to inquire who they were, but
out of the sense of common humanity, run forth and met them,
and gladly entertained them, not knowing whom they should
receive. St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> considering the circumstances of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
fact, that he sate at his tent door, and that in the heat of
the day, that he came to meet them, thinks he therefore sate in
publick, and endured the inconvenience of the heat even for this
purpose, that he might not let slip any occasion of being hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.
The writings of the <hi>Fathers</hi> run much in commendation of
the ancient <hi>Moncks,</hi> and were they such as they report, well did
they deserve to be commended, for their manner was to sit in
the fields, and by the high way sides, for this end, that they
might direct wandring passengers into the way, that they might
relieve all that were distressed by want, or bruising or breaking
of any member, and carry them home into their cells, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
unto them all duties of humanity. This serves well to
tax us, who affect a kinde of intempestive prudence, and unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
discretion in performing that little good we do, from
whom so hardly after long enquiry and entreaty drops some
small benevolence, like the sun in winter long ere it rise and
quickly gone. How many occasions of Christian charity do
we let slip, when we refuse to give our alms, unless we first cast
doubts, and examine the persons, their lives, their necessities,
though it be only to reach out some small thing, which is due
unto him, whatsoever it be. It was anciently a complaint a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Church, that the liberality of the <hi>Christians</hi> made
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114807:49"/>
many idle persons. Be it that it was so yet no other thing befel
them, then what befals their Lord, who knows and sees<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<hi>Sun-shine</hi> and his <hi>Rain</hi> is every day abused, and yet the Sun
become not like a Sack nor the Heavens as Brass; unto him must
we, by his own command, be like: and whom then can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that have a pattern of such courtesie proposed to us to
follow? we read in our books of a nice <hi>Athenian</hi> being entertain'd
in a place by one given to hospitality, finding anon that another
was received with the like curtesie, and then a third, growing
very angry. I thought, said he, that I had found here <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> I look't for a <hi>friends house,</hi> but I
am fallen into an <hi>Inne</hi> to entertain all Comers, rather then a
Lodging for some private &amp; especial friends. Let it not offend any
that I have made Christianity rather an <hi>Inne</hi> to receive all, then a
private house to receive some few. For so both the precepts and
examples I have brought, teach us, <hi>beneficia praestare non homini,
sed humano generi,</hi> to extend our good, not to this or that man,
but to mankind, like the Sun that ariseth not on this or that nation,
but on the whole world. <hi>Julian</hi> observes of the <hi>fig-tree,</hi> that above
all trees it is most capable of grafts &amp; Siences of other kinds, so far
as that all variety will be brought to take nourishment from one
stock: Beloved, a Christian must be like unto <hi>Julians fig-tree,</hi>
so Universally compassionate, that so all sorts of grafts by a
kinde of Christian inoculation may be brought to draw life and
nourishment from his root.</p>
                  <p>But I am all this while in a generality only, and I must not
forget, that I have many <hi>particular sick Patients,</hi> in my Text, of
whom every one must have his <hi>Recipe,</hi> and I must visit them all
ere I go. But withal, I must remember my <hi>Method</hi> which was
still as I spake, of <hi>Receiving the weak</hi> to speak likewise of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
them from disputation. So must I needs ere I pass away,
tax this our age, for giving so general permission unto all to busie
themselves in doubtful cases of Religion. For nothing is there
that hath more prejudiced the cause of <hi>Religion,</hi> then this <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuous</hi>
and careless <hi>admission</hi> of all sorts to the hearing and
handling of controversies, whether we consider the private
case of every man, or the publick state of the Church. I will
touch but one inconvenience which much annoyes the Church,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114807:49"/>
by opening this gate so wide to all commers, for by the great
preass of people that come, the work of the Lord is much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.
Not to speak of those who out of <hi>weakness</hi> of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
fall into many errors, and by reason of liberty of bequeathing
their errors to the world by writing easily finde heirs for them.
There is a sort that do harm by being <hi>unnecessary,</hi> and though
they sowe not <hi>tares</hi> in the field, yet fill the Lords floor with
chaff; For what need this great <hi>breed of writers,</hi> with which in
this age the world doth swarm? how many of us might spare
the pains in committing our Meditations to writing, contenting
our selves to teach the people <hi>vivâ voce,</hi> and suffering our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
quietly to die in their birth? The teaching the people by
voice is perpetually necessary, should all of us every where
speak but the same things; For all cannot use Books, and all that
can have not the leisure; To remedy therefore the want of skill
in the one and of time in the other, are we set in this Ministry of
Preaching. Our voices are confin'd to a certain compass, and
tied to the Individuating properties of <hi>Hic</hi> and <hi>Nunc:</hi> our
writings are unlimited. Necessity therefore requires a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of speakers, a multitude of writers, not so. <q>G. Agricola
<hi>writing</hi> de Animantibus subterraneis <hi>reports of a certain kinde
of</hi> Spirits <hi>that converse in</hi> Minerals <hi>and much infest those that work
in them, and the manner of them when they come is, to seem to busie
themselves according to all the custom of workmen; they will dig
and cleanse and melt and sever mettals, yet when they are gone,
the workmen do not finde that there is any thing done: so fares it
with a great part of the multitude, who thrust themselves into the
controversies of the times, they write Books, move questions frame
distinctions, give solutions, and seem sedulously to do, whatsoever
the nature of the business requires, yet if any skilful workman in
the Lords Mines shall come and examine their work, he shall finde
them to be but</hi> Spirits in Minerals, <hi>and that withal this labor and
stir there is nothing done.</hi>
                     </q> I acknowledge it to be very true,
which S. <hi>Austine</hi> spake in his first Book <hi>de Trinitate: Utile est
plures libros à pluribus fieri diverso stilo, sed non diversâ fide, etiam
de quaestionibus iisdem, ut ad plurimos res ipsa perveniat ad alios sic,
ad alios vero sic.</hi> It is a thing very profitable that diverse <hi>Tracts</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:114807:50"/>
be written by divers men, after divers fashions, but according to
the same Analogy of Faith, even of the same questions that
some might come into the hands of all, to some on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to another after that. For this may we think to have been
the counsel of the Holy Ghost himself, who may seem even for
this purpose, to have registred the self same things of Christ by
three of the <hi>Evangelists</hi> with little difference; Yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
if this speech of S. <hi>Austine</hi> admit of being qualified,
then was there no time which more then this age required it,
should be moderated, which I note, because of a noxious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
spread in our Universities to the great hindering of true
proficiency in Study springing out from this Root. For many
of the Learned themselves are fallen upon this preposterous
conceit, that learning consisteth rather in varieting of turning
and quoting of sundry Authors, then in soundly discovering and
laying down the truth of things. Out of which arises a greater
charge unto the poor Student, who now goes by number rather
then weight, and the Books of the learned themselves, by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitiously
heaping up the conceits, and authorities of other men
increase much in the bulk, but do as much imbase in true value.
Wherefore as <hi>Gedeons army,</hi> of two and thirty thousand by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script
from God was brought unto three hundred: So this huge
army of disputes, might without any hazard of the Lords battles,
be well contracted into a smaller number. <hi>Justinian</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porour
when he found that the study of the <hi>Civil Law</hi> was sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
and much confused, by reason of the great heaps of unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
writings, he calls an assembly of learned men, caus'd
them to search the books, to cut of what was superfluous to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
into order and method the sum and substance of the whole
Law: were it possible that some Religious <hi>Justinian</hi> might after
the same manner imploy the wits of some of the best Learned
in examining the controversies, and selecting out of the best
writers what is necessary, defaulting unnecessary and partial
discourses, and so digest into order and method, and leave for
the direction of posterity as it were <hi>Theological pandects:</hi> infinite
store of our books might very well lie by, and peaceably be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
and after ages reap greater profit with smaller cost and
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114807:50"/>
pains. But that which was possible in the world united under
<hi>Justinian</hi> in this great division of Kingdoms is peradventure im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible.
Wherefore having contented my self to shew what a
great and irremediable inconvenience this free, and uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ventring upon <hi>Theological disputes</hi> hath brought upon us, I
will leave this project as a Speculation, and pass from this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Doctrine unto some particulars. For this generality, and
heap of sick persons, I must divide into their kindes and give eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one his proper <hi>Recipe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>first</hi> in this order of weak persons, so to be received &amp; che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risht
by us, is one of whom question may be made whether he
may be called <hi>weak</hi> or no; he may seem to be rather dead: for no
pulse of infused grace beats in him. I mean such a one who hath
but smal, or peradventure no knowledge at all in the mystery of
Christ, yet is otherwise, a man of upright life and conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
such a one as we usually name <hi>a moral man.</hi> Account
you of such a one as dead, or how you please, yet methinks I
finde a <hi>Recipe</hi> for him in my text. For this man is even to be
woed by us, as sometimes one heathen man wisht of another,
<hi>Talis c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>m sis utinam noster esses;</hi> This man may speak unto a
Christian as <hi>Ruth does</hi> unto <hi>Booz, spread the skirt of thy garment
over me, for thou art a near kinsman.</hi> Two parts there are that
do compleatly make up a <hi>Christian</hi> man. A true <hi>Faith,</hi> and an
honest <hi>conversation.</hi> The first, though it seem the worthier, and
therefore gives unto us the name of Christians, yet the second
in the end will proove the surer. For true profession without
<hi>honest conversation,</hi> not only saves not, but increases our weight
of punishment: but a good life without true profession, though
it bring us not to Heaven, yet it lessens the measure of our
judgement: so that <hi>a moral man so called is a Christian by the
surer side.</hi> As our Saviour saith of one in the Gospel that had
wisely and discreetly answered him, <hi>Thou art not far from the
kingdom of Heaven:</hi> So may we say of these men, suppose that
as yet they be not of, yet certainly far from the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
they cannot be, yea, this sincerity of life though sever'd
from true profession, did seem such a jewel in the eyes of some
of the ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> that their opinion was and so have they
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114807:51"/>
in their writings (erroneously doubtless) yet so have they testifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it, that God hath in store for such men not only this mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
mercy of which but now I spake, but even saving grace so
far forth as to make them possessors of his Kingdom. Let it
not trouble you that I intitle them to some part of our Christian
Faith, and therefore without scruple to be received as weak
and not to be cast forth as dead. <hi>Salvianus</hi> disputing what
Faith is, <hi>Quid est igitur credulitas vel fides?</hi> saith he, <hi>opinor fideliter
hominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Christo credere, id est, fidele<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Deo esse, hoc est fideliter Dei manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
servare.</hi> What might this faith be? (saith he) I suppose it is
nothing else, but faithfully to believe Christ, and this is to be
faithful unto God, which is nothing else but faithfully to <hi>keep
the commandments of God.</hi> Not therefore only a bare belief, but
the fidelity &amp; trustiness of Gods servants faithfully accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the will of our Master, is required as a part of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
Faith. Now all those good things which moral men by
the light of nature do, are a part of Gods will written in their
hearts, wherefore so far as they were conscientious in perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them (if <hi>Salvianus</hi> his reason be good) so far have they title
and interest in our Faith. And therefore <hi>Regulus</hi> that famous
<hi>Roman,</hi> when he endured infinite torments rather then he would
break his <hi>Oath,</hi> may thus far be counted a Martyr, and witness for
the truth. For the Crown of Martyrdom sits not only on the
heads of those who have lost their lives, rather then they would
cease to profess the Name of Christ, but on the head of every
one that suffers for the testimony of a good conscience, and for
righteousness sake. And here I cannot pass by one very gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
gross mistaking of our age. For in our discourses concerning
the notes of a Christian man, by what <hi>signes</hi> we may know a
man to be one of the visible company of Christ, we have so
tied our selves to this outward profession that if we know no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
vertue in a man, but that he hath cond his Creed by heart,
let his life be never so profane we think it argument enough for
us to account him within the Pale and Circuit of the Church:
on the contrary side let his life be never so upright, if either he
little seen in, or peradventure quite ignorant of the Mystery of
Christ, we esteem of him but as dead; and those who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114807:51"/>
well of those moral good things as of some tokens giving
hope of life, we account but as a kinde of <hi>Manichees,</hi> who
thought the very earth had life in it. I must confess that I have
not yet made that proficiency in the Schools of our age, as that
I could see: why the second table and the Acts of it, are not as
properly the parts of Religion and Christianity, as the Acts and
observations of the first. If I mistake, then it is S. <hi>James</hi> that
hath abus'd me, for he describing Religion by its proper Acts,
tells us, that <hi>True Religion and undefiled before God and the Father is
to visit the Fatherless and the widow in their affliction, and to keep
himself unspotted of the world.</hi> So that the thing which is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>special
refine dialect of the new Christian language signifies
nothing but morality and civility, that in the language of the
holy Ghost imports true Religion. Wherefore any difference
that the holy Ghost makes notwithstanding, the man of vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
dispositions, though ignorant of the mystery of Christ, be it
<hi>Fabricius</hi> or <hi>Regulus</hi> or any ancient heathen man, famous for sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
and uprightness of carriage, hath as sure a claim and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
in the Church of Christ as the man deepest skil'd in, most
certainly believing, and openly professing all, that is, written in
the holy books of God, if he endevour not to <hi>shew his faith by his
works.</hi> The Ancients therefore where they found this kinde of
men gladly received them, and converst, familiarly with them, as
appears by the friendly entercourse of Epistles of S. <hi>Basil</hi> with
<hi>Libanius</hi> of <hi>Nazianzen</hi> and <hi>Austen</hi> with sundry others, and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity
hath either left us true, or forged us false Epistles betwixt
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> himself and <hi>Seneca.</hi> Now as for the admitting of
any of these men to the discussing of the doubts in our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
mysteries, who either know not, or peradventure contemn
them, there needs not much be said: by a <hi>Cannon</hi> of one of the
<hi>Councels of Carthage</hi> it appears, it had sometimes been the errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
practise of some Christians to Baptize the dead, and to put
the Sacrament of Christs body into their mouths. Since we have
confest these men to be in a sort dead, as having no supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
quickning grace from above, to put into their hands the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of the word of life at all, much more of discussing of the
doubtful things in it, were nothing else, but to Baptize a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cass,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:114807:52"/>
and put the communion bread into the mouth of the dead.
Wherefore leaving this kinde of weak person to your courteous
acceptance.</p>
                  <p>Let us consider of <hi>another,</hi> one quite contrary to the former;
a true professor, but a man of <hi>prophane</hi> and wicked life, one
more dangerously ill then the former, have we any <hi>recipe</hi> for
this man? May seem for him there is no balm in <hi>Gilead,</hi> he
seems like unto the <hi>Lepar</hi> in the law, unto whom no man might
draw near, and by so much the more dangerous is his case, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the condition of conversing with heathen men, be they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so wicked is permitted unto Christians by our Apostle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
whereas with this man all commerce seems by the same
Apostle to be quite cut off. For in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. St. <hi>Paul</hi> having
forbidden them formerly all manner of conversing with <hi>Fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
infamous</hi> persons, and men subject to grievous crimes, and
considering at length how impossible this was, because of the
Gentiles with whom they lived, and amongst whom necessarily
they were to converse and trade, he distinguishes between the
<hi>fornicators</hi> of this world, and the <hi>fornicators</hi> which were Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.
I meant not (saith the Blessed Apostle) expounding
himself <hi>that ye should not admit of the Fornicators of this world,</hi> that
is, such as were Gentiles; for then must ye have sought a new
world. So great and general a liberty at that time had the
world assumed for the practise of that sin of <hi>fornication,</hi> that
strictly to have forbidden them the company of fornicators had
almost been to have excluded them the society of mankinde.
But saith he, <hi>if a brother be a fornicator or a thief, or a railer with
such a one partake not, no not so much as to eat.</hi> Wherefore the case
of this person seems to be desperate. For he is not only mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
sick, but is bereft of all help of the Physician, yet notwwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
all this we may not give him over for gone, for when
we have well searcht our boxes, we shall finde a <hi>Recipe</hi> even for
him too, think we that our Apostles meaning was, that we should
acquaint our selves only with the good, and not the bad; as
Physicians in the time of <hi>pestilence</hi> look only to the sound, and
shun the diseas'd? Our <hi>Saviour Christ</hi> familiarly converst, eat,
and drank with <hi>Publicans</hi> and sinners, and gives the reason of it;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114807:52"/>
because he came not to call the Righteous but sinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.
Is Christ contrary to <hi>Paul?</hi> this reason of our Saviour
concerns <hi>every</hi> one on whom the duty of saving of Souls doth
rest. It is the main drift of his message and unavoidably he is
to converse, yea, eat and drink with all sorts of sinners, even
because he is to <hi>call not the righteous but sinners to repentance.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
it is that some means be left to reclaim notorious offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
let their disease be never so dangerous. <hi>Nescio an in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremis
aliquid tentare medicina sit, certè nihil tentare perditio est,</hi> who
can tell whether in this extremity, were it at the last cast it may
some way profit, to receive him, but this we all know that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
to cast him out of the society of good men, is to cut him
off from all outward means of health. The <hi>Leper</hi> in the law
though he were excluded the multitude; yet had he access unto
the <hi>Priest.</hi> Beloved the priest in the new law hath much greater
priviledge then the ancient had, he was only a judge and could
not cure: but this is both a judge and a Physician, and can both
discern and cure the leprosie of our souls; wherefore he is not to
be excluded from the most desperately sick person. Neither
doth this duty concern the priest alone. For as <hi>Tertullian</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
spake in another case; <hi>In majestatis reos &amp; publicos hostes om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis
homo miles est.</hi> Against Traitors and publick enemies every
man is a souldier, so is it true in this. Every one who is of
strength to pull a soul out of the fire, is for this business, by
counsel, by advice, by rebuking a priest, neither must he let
him lie there to expect better help. Again, no man so ill but
hath some good thing in him, though it break not out, as being
clouded and darkned with much corruption, we must take heed,
that we do not <hi>pro solis comprehendere frequentissima</hi> mistake in
thinking there is nothing else but evil, where we often see it.
We must therefore entertain even nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> friendship with such a
one to discover him. <hi>Nemo enim nisi per amicitiam cognoscitur,</hi>
saith St. <hi>Austine.</hi> No man is perfectly discovered, but by his
inward acquaintance. As therefore they who seek for trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
give not over by reason of clay and mire, so long as there is
any hope to speed: so may we not cast off our industry, though
it labour in the most polluted soul, <hi>ut ad quaedam sana in quorum
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114807:53"/>
delectaetione acquiescamus per charitatis tolerantiam perducamur,</hi> that
so at length, through charitable patience and long suffering we
may discover in him some good things which may content us for
the present, and give hope of better things to come. For as
they that work in gold and costly matter, diligently save every
little piece that falls away: so goodness wheresoever it be, is a
thing so precious that every little spark of it deserves our care in
cherishing. Many miscarry through the want of this patience,
in those who undertake them, whilest they despair of
them too soon; <hi>dum ita obiurgant quasi oderint,</hi> whilest
they rebuke us, as if they hated, and upbraid rather then
reprehend. <hi>Transit convitium et intemperantia culpatur, uterque
qui periere arguuntur.</hi> As unskilful Physicians, who suffer their
patients to die under their hands, to hide their error, blame
their patients intemperance: so let us take heed, least it be not
so much the strength of the disease, as the want of skill in us
which we strive to cover, and vail over with the names of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy
intemperance or the like. <hi>David</hi> received an express
message from the Prophet, that the childe conceived in adultery
should surely die, yet he ceast not his prayers, &amp; tears, and fasting
as long as there was life in it: we receive no such certain message
concerning any mans miscarriage, and why then should we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termit
any office which Christian patience can afford. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
what <hi>Maecenas</hi> sometime spake loosly in another sense, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilem
facito manu, debilem pede, coxa: lubricos quate dentes: vita
dum superest bene est,</hi> that we may apply more properly to our
purpose, let our weak person here be lame, hand and foot, hip
and thigh, sick in head and heart, yet so long as there is life in
him, there is no cause we should despair. How knowest thou
how potent the word of God may be through thy ministrie, out
of these stones to raise up children unto <hi>Abraham?</hi> I cannot
therefore perswade my self. that this <hi>prohibition</hi> of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> of
which we but now spake, so far extended, as that it quite inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
good men the company of the sinners, be they never
so grosse. For when he delivered men unto Satan, (the
greatest thing that ever he did in this kinde) it was <hi>ad interitum
carnis,</hi> to the mortifying of the flesh, that so the spirit might be
safe in the day of the Lord. But this is worse, for by this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:114807:53"/>
excluding the grosse sinner from the good, a greater
gap is opened to the liberty of the flesh, and a more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
way could not be found to bring final destruction on him at
that day. The extent therefore of St. <hi>Pauls</hi> precept, though given
in shew to all, I take to reach no farther then the weak, and such
as are in danger of infection; for the weaker sort of men are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
evermore the most, and a charge given unto the most,
is commonly given under the stile of all. Our Apostle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
jealous of the tenderer sort, whom every unwholsome blast
doth easily taint, seems, what he intended for the most to make
general to all. The reason which the Apostle gives, does war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
this restraint. <hi>See ye not</hi> (saith he) <hi>that a little leaven sowers
the whole lump?</hi> If therefore there be any part of the lump, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
out of shot and danger of sowring and contagion, on it
this precept can have no extent: and surely some wrong it were
to the Church of Christ, to suppose that all were necessarily
subject to sowring and infection, upon supposal of some admis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of leaven. Evil indeed is infectious, but neither necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
nor yet so, that it need fright us from those who are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eased
with it. Contagious diseases which ceaze on our bodies,
infect by natural force and means, which we cannot prevent:
but no man drinks down this poyson, whose will is not the hand
that takes the Cup: so that to converse with men of diseas'd
mindes infects us not, except we will. Again, <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his
problems, makes a question, <hi>why health doth not infect as well as
sickness.</hi> For we grow sick many times by incautelously conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
with the diseas'd: but no man grows well by accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the healthy: thus indeed it is with the healthiness of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy:
it hath no transient force on others, but the strength and
healthiness of the minde carries with it a gracious kinde of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:
and common experience tells us, <hi>that nothing profits evil
men more then the company of the good.</hi> So that strength of minde
accompanied with the preservative of the grace of God, may
not only without fear of contagion, safely converse with ungra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
sinners, but by so doing, as it were infect them, and make
them such as himself is. No cause therefore hitherto, why the
true professors, though notorious sinners should not be partakers
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114807:54"/>
of our Christian Courtesies; and therefore as of the former, so
of this my conclusion is, we must receive him. Only let me
adde St. <hi>Pauls</hi> words in another place, <hi>Ye that are strong, receive
such a one.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HAving thus far spoken of his <hi>admission,</hi> let us now a little
consider of his <hi>Restraint;</hi> and see whether he may have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
part in hearing and handling religious controversies; where
plainly to speak my minde, as his admission before was, so his
exclusion here is much more necessary, the way to these schools
should be open to none, but to men of upright life and conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
and that as well in regard of the prophane and wicked men
themselves, as of the cause which they presume to handle: for
as for themselves this is but the <hi>field,</hi> wherein they sow and reap
their own infamy and disgrace. Our own experience tells us;
how hard a thing it is for men of behaviour known to be spotless,
to avoid the lash of those mens tongues, who make it their chief
fence to disgrace the persons, when they cannot touch the cause.
For what else are the writings of many men, but <hi>mutual Pasquils</hi>
and <hi>Satyrs</hi> against each others lives, wherein digladiating like
<hi>Eschines</hi> and <hi>Demosthenes,</hi> they reciprocally lay open each others
filthiness to the view and scorn of the world. The fear there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of being stained, and publickly disgraced, might be reason
enough to keep them back from entring these contentions. And
as for the cause it self, into which this kind of men do put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
needs must it go but ill with it: for is it possible that
those respects which sway and govern their ordinary actions,
should have no influence upon their pens? It cannot be, that
they who speak, and plot, and act wickedness, should ever
write uprightly. <hi>Nam ut in vita, ita et in causis quo<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>
                           </am>
                           <ex>que</ex>
                        </expan> spes improbas ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent:</hi>
doubtless, as in their lives, so in the causes they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
they nourish hopes full of improbity. Besides all this, the
opinion of the common sort is not to be contemned, whom no
kind of reason so much abuses, and carries away, as when the
discredit of the person is retorted on the cause, which thing our
adversaries here at home amongst us know very well, a master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece,
of whose pollicy it is to put into the hands of the people,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:114807:54"/>
such pamphlets which hurt not our cause at all, but onely
discredit our persons. Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> observes out of the
ancient customes of the <hi>Olympian games,</hi> that whensoever a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
man offered himself to contend in them, he was not to
be admitted till publick Proclamation had been made tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout
the multitude to this purpose, Whither any man
knew him to be either a servant, or a thief, or otherwise
of infamous life. And if any imputation in this kinde were
proved against him, it was sufficient to keep him back.
Had the Heathen this care that their vanities should not be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scredited?
how great then must our care be, that they which
enter into these exercises, be of pure and upright condition?
Let mens skill and judgement therefore be never so good, yet
if their lives be notoriously subject to exception, Let them know
that there is no place for them in <hi>these Olympicks.</hi> Men indeed in
civil business have found out a distinction betwen an <hi>honest</hi> man
and a good <hi>Common wealths-man:</hi> and therefore <hi>Fabricias</hi> in the
<hi>Roman</hi> story is much commended for nominating to the <hi>Consulship
Ruffinus</hi> a wicked man and his utter enemy, because he knew him
to be serviceable to the Common-wealth, for those wars which
were then depending. But in the business of the Lord and
Common-wealth of God, we can admit of no such distinction.
For God himself in the book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> staves them off with a
<hi>Quid tua ut enarres mea, &amp;c.</hi> What hast thou to do to take my
words into thy mouth since thou hatest to be reformed? The
world for the managing of her matters, may imploy such as
her self hath fitted: <hi>but let every one who names the name of God
depart from iniquity.</hi> For these reasons therefore is it very expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
that none but right good men should undertake the Lords
quarrels, the rather because there is some truth in that which
<hi>Quintilian</hi> spake, <hi>Cogitare optima simul &amp; deterrima, non magis est
unius animi, quam ejusdem hominis bonum esse ac malum.</hi> As impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
it is that good and bad thoughts should harbor in the same
heart, as it is for the same man to be joyntly good, and bad. And
so from the consideration of this sick person, let us proceed to
visit the next. The weak persons, I have hitherto treated of are
the fewest as consisting in a kinde of extream. For the greatest
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:114807:55"/>
sort of men are in a mediocrity of men eminently good or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
ill the number is smallest; but this rank of sick persons
that now we are to view is an whole army and may be every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one
of us, if we do well examine our selves, shall finde our
selves in it: For the weak whom we now are to speak of, is he
that hath not that degree and perfection of faith and strength
of Spiritual constitution that he ought to have; Wherefore
our <hi>Recipe</hi> here must be like the <hi>Tree of life</hi> in the book of the
<hi>Revelation,</hi> it must be medicine to heal whole nations. For who
is he amongst men that can free himself from this weakness?
Yea, we our selves that are set over others for their cure, may
speak of our selves and our charge, as <hi>Jolaus</hi> in <hi>Euripides</hi> doth of
himself and <hi>Hercules children,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
we take care of these, our selves standing in need
of others care for us. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> counsels his Physician, to
look especially, that himself be healthy to be<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <hi>fair of colour and full of flesh.</hi> For otherwise saith he
how can he give comfort and hope of success to a sick patient,
who by his ill colour and meagerness bewraies some imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of his own. But what Physician of Soul and manners is
capable of this counsel; or who is it that taking the cure of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
doth not in most of his actions bewray his owne desease?
even thus hath it pleased God to tie us together with a mutual
sense of each others weakness, and as our selves receive and
bear with others; so for our selves interchangeably must we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
the same courtesie at others hands: Notwithstanding, as
it is with the health of our bodies, no man at any time is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
well, only he goes for an healthy man, who is least
sick: so fares it with our souls, God hath encluded all under
the name of weak, some peradventure is less weak then others
but no man is strong. <hi>Infaelicissimu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Consolationis genus est de miseriis
hominu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> peccatorum capere solatia.</hi> It is but a miserable comfort to
judg our own perfections only by others defects, yet this is all the
comfort we have. Let us leave therefore those who by reason
of being less crazy pass for healthy, and consider of those whom
some sensible and eminent imperfection above others hath
rank't in the number of the weak. And of those there are sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:114807:55"/>
kindes, especially two. One is weake because he is not yet
fully informed, not so sufficiently Catechized in the Mysteries
of Faith, whom farther Institution may bring to better Matu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
The other peradventure is sufficiently grounded for prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Faith, yet is weak, by reason either of some passion or
of some irritatory and troublesome humor in his behaviour,
<hi>nullum unquam ingenium placuit sine veniâ.</hi> There is no man so
perfect, but hath somewhat in his behaviour that requireth
pardon. As for the imperfection of the former of these, It is the
weakness of infancy and childehood in Faith rather then a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sease:
And with this weak man we are especially to bear above
all others. For as for him that is weak through gross and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ignorance or contumacy or the like, it is pardonable, if some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
we yeild him not that measure of curtesie, which were
meet, but to be cruel against infancy and childehood were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity.
The manner of our <hi>Recipe</hi> for these men, our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle
somewhere expresses where he tells us of some that must
<hi>be fed with milk and not strong meat:</hi> Unto these we must ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be as <hi>Nurses</hi> then Physicians, <hi>submittendo nos ad mensuram
discentis, &amp; manu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dando &amp; gradu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> nostra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> minuendo,</hi> by gently submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
our selves to the capacity of the learner, by lending our
hand by lessning our steps to keep them in equipace with us till
they come up to their full growth. As <hi>Christ being God</hi> emptied
himself, and <hi>became Man</hi> like to us, so must we lay down our
gifts of wit, in which we flatter our selves and take our
selves to be as Gods, and in shew and fashion become like one
of them. Grave men have thought it no disparagement, to have bin
seen with their little sons, <hi>Ludere par impar equitare in arundine
longâ,</hi> toying and practising with them their childish sports: and
if any take offence at it, they are such as know not what it is to
be Fathers. Those therefore who bear the office of <hi>Fathers</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
other men, to bring up the infancy of Babes in
Christ, must not blush to practise this part of a Father, and out of
<hi>Pauls</hi> lesson of <hi>becoming all to all,</hi> learn to become a childe to
children, do it he may very well, without any impeachment to
himself. He that helps one up that is fallen, <hi>non se projicit ut
ambo jaceant, sed incurvat tantum ut jacentem erigat,</hi> throws not
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:114807:56"/>
himself down to lie by him, but gently stoops to lift him up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain;
but of this weak person, I have little need, I trust to
speak. For no man in these days can be long weak, but by
his own default, so long and careful teaching as hath been and
every day is, must needs take from men all pretence of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in this kinde. <hi>Nam quid aliud agimus docendo vos, quam ne
semper docendi sitis.</hi> For what is the end of all this labor and
pains in teaching, but that ye might at length not need a teacher.
Wherefore from this I come unto that other weak person, strong
in Faith, but <hi>weak in carriage</hi> and behaviour.</p>
                  <p>Having before proved that Christian curtesie spreads it self to
all sorts of men, to the <hi>Insidel,</hi> to the gross <hi>notorious sinner,</hi> then
will it without any streining at all come home to all the <hi>infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities</hi>
of our weaker brethren: For that which can endure so
great a tempest, how can it be offended with some small
drops. Is Christian patience like unto Saint <hi>Peters</hi> resolution,
that durst manfully encounter the high Priests servant, yet
was danted at the voice of a silly maiden, whatsoever it is that
is irksome unto us in the common behaviour of our Brethren,
it were strange we should not be able to brook. <hi>Epictetus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>considering
with himself, the weakness which is usual in men,
still to make the worst of what befals us, wittily tells us that
every thing in the world hath two handles one turn'd toward us
which we may easily take, the other turn'd from us harder to be
laid hold of; the first makes all things easie, the second not so,
The instance that he brings in my very purpose. <q>
                        <hi>Be it saith he,
thy Brother hath offended thee, here are two hand-fasts, one of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
the other of thy Brother. If thou take hold of that of the
offence it will be too hot for thee, thou wilt not easily endure the
touch of it: but if thou lay hold of that of thy Brother, this will
make all behaviour tolerable. There is no part of our Brothers carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
towards us but if we search it, we shall finde, some hand-fast,
some circumstance, that will make it easie to be born.</hi>
                     </q> If we can
can finde no other, the circumstance of our Saviour Christs
example will never fail. An example which will not only make
us to endure the importunity of his ordinary behaviour, but all
his outragious dealing whatsoever. For saith S. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:114807:56"/>
didst thou know that thy Brother intended particular mischief
against thee that he would embrue his hand in thy blood,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, yet kiss that hand, for thy Lord did
not refuse to kiss that that mouth that made the bargain for his
blood. It is storied of <hi>Protagoras</hi> that being a poor youth and
carrying a <hi>burthen of sticks,</hi> he piled so them, and laid them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
with such art &amp; order, that he made them much more light
and easie to be born. Beloved, there is an Art among Christians
like unto that of <hi>Protagoras</hi> of so making up and ordering our
burthens, that they may lie with much less weight upon our
shoulders, this art, if we could learn it, would make us
take all in good part at our Brothers hand, were he as bad
as <hi>Nabal</hi> was, of whom his own servant complain'd that
he was such a man of <hi>Belial that no man could speak unto
him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore leaving you to the study, and learning of this most
Christian art, I will a little consider for what Reasons we may
not admit of these two sorts of weak men to <hi>controversie.</hi> For
as for the unlearned, in private, nothing more usual with them
then to take offence at our dissentions, and to become more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
and unjoynted upon the hearing of any question discust.
It is their usual voyce and question to us: Is it possible that we
should be at one in these points in which your selves do disagree?
thus cast they off, on our backs the burthen of their back-sliding
and neutrality, wherefore to acquaint them with disputation
in Religion, were as it were to blast them in their infancy, and
bring upon them some improsperous Disease to hinder their
growth in Christ. Secondly, what one said of other contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<hi>In bellis civilibus audacia etiam valet singulorum,</hi> In civil wars no
man is too weak to do a mischief, we have found too true in these
our <hi>Sacra Bella;</hi> no man is to weak, (I say not) to do mischief, but
to be a principal Agent and Captain in them. Simple and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
souls train'd up by men of contentious spirits have had
strength enough to be Authors of dangerous heresies, <hi>Priscilla</hi>
and <hi>Maximilla,</hi> silly women laden with iniquity were the
chief ring-leaders in the error of the <hi>Montanists,</hi> and as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
said, <hi>bellum inchoant inertes, fortes finiunt,</hi> weaklings
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:114807:57"/>
are able to begin a quarrel, but the prosecution and finishing is
a work for stronger men, so hath it fared here. For that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
which these poor souls had raised, <hi>Tertullian</hi> a man of great
Wit and Learning is drawn to undertake: so that for a <hi>Barnabas</hi>
to be drawn away to error, there needs not always the example
and authority of a <hi>Peter.</hi> A third reason is the marvellous vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of the weaker sort in maintaining their conceits, if once
they begin to be opiniative. For one thing there is that wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
prevails against the reclaiming of them, and that is, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
jealousie they have of all that is said unto them by men of
better wits, stand it with reason never so good, if it sound
not as they would have it. A jealousie founded in the sense of
their weakness arising out of this that they suspect all to be done
for no other end, but to circumvent and abuse them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
when they see themselves to be too weak in reasoning, they
easily turn them to violence. The <hi>Monks of Egypt,</hi> otherwise
devout, and religious men anciently, were for the most part
unlearned, &amp; generally given over to the error of the <hi>Anthropomor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitae,</hi>
who held that God had hands and feet and all the parts
that a man hath, and was in outward shape and proportion
like to one of us. <hi>Theophilus</hi> a Learned Bishop of <hi>Alexandria</hi>
having fallen into their hands was so roughly used by them, that
ere he could get out of their fingers, he was fain to use his wits
and to crave aid of his Equivocating Sophistry and soothly to
tell them. <hi>I have seen your face as the face of God.</hi> Now when
Christian and Religious doubts, must thus be managed with
wilfulness and violence, what mischief may come of it is already
so plain, that it needs not my finger to point it out. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let every such weak person say unto himself, as Saint <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
doth, <hi>Tu ratiocinare, ego mirer, disputa tu ego credam,</hi> let o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
reason I will marvel. Let others dispute I will believe. As
for the man strong in passion or rather weak, for the strength of
passion is the weakness of the passionate; great reason hath the
Church to except against him. For first of all from him it
comes that our books are so stuft with contumelious maledicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
no heathen writers having left the like example of chol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
and gross impatience. An hard thing, I know it is to write
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114807:57"/>
without affection and passion in those things which we love, and
therefore it is free so to do, to those who are Lords over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
It seems our Saviour gave some way to it himself. For
somewhat certainly his Kinsmen saw in his behaviour, when as
S. <hi>Mark</hi> reports they went forth to lay hold upon him <hi>thinking
he was beside himself.</hi> But for those who have not the command
of themselves, better it were they laid it by, S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently
observeth that the <hi>Prophets</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> were by
this notoriously differenced, that they which gave <hi>Oracles</hi> by
motion from the <hi>Devil</hi> did it with much impatience and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
with a kinde of <hi>fury</hi> and <hi>madness</hi> but they which gave
<hi>Oracles</hi> from <hi>God</hi> by <hi>Divine Inspiration,</hi> gave them with all <hi>mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
and <hi>temper,</hi> If it be the cause of God which we handle in
our writings, then let us handle it like the Prophets of God with
quietness and moderation, and not in the violence of passion, as
if we were possest, rather then inspir'd. Again, what equity or
indifferency can we look for in the carriage of that cause, that
falls into the handling of these men. <hi>Quis conferre duces meminit
qui pendere causas? Quâ stetit inde favet,</hi> what man overtaken
with passion remembers impartially to compare cause with
cause, and right with right. <hi>Quâ stetit inde favet</hi>—on what
cause he happens, that is he resolute to maintain, <hi>ut gladiator in
arenam;</hi> as a Fencer to the Stage, so comes he to write, not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
conscience of quarrel, but because he proposes to contend,
yea, so potently hath this humor prevail'd with men that have
undertaken to maintain a faction, that it hath broken out to the
tempting of God, and the dishonour of Martyrdom. Two
<hi>Fryers</hi> in <hi>Florence</hi> in the action of <hi>Savonoralla,</hi> voluntarily in the
open view of the City, offer'd to enter the fire: so to put an
end to the controversie, that he might be judged to have the right
who like one of the three children in <hi>Babylon,</hi> should pass un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch't
through the fire. But I hasten to visit one weak person
more and so an end.</p>
                  <p>He whom we now are to visit, is a man weak through <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical</hi>
and <hi>erring Faith,</hi> now whether or no, we have any receit
for him it may be doubtful; For S. <hi>Paul</hi> advises us to avoid the
man, that is, a maker of Sects, knowing him to be damned.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:114807:58"/>
yet, if as we spake of not admitting to us the notorious sinner,
no not to eat, so we teach of this, that it is delivered respective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to the weaker sort; as justly for the same reasons we may
do: we shall have a <hi>Recipe</hi> here for the man that erres in faith,
and rejoyceth in making of Sects: which we shall the better do,
if we can but gently draw him on to a moderation to think of his
conceits only as of opinions; for it is not the variety of opinions,
but our own perverse wills, who think it meet, that all should
be conceited as our selves are, which hath so inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
the Church, were we not so ready to anathematize
each other, where we concur not in opinion, we might in
hearts be united, though in our tongues we were divided,
and that with singular profit to all sides, <hi>It is the unity of the
Spirit in the bond of peace,</hi> and not <hi>Identitie of conceit,</hi>
which the Holy Ghost requires at the hands of Christians. I
will give you one instance, in which at this day our Churches
are at variance. The <hi>will of God,</hi> and his manner of proceeding
in <hi>predestination</hi> is undiscernable, and shall so remain until that
day, wherein all knowledge shall be <hi>made perfect,</hi> yet some there
are, who with probability of Scripture teach, that the <hi>true</hi> cause
of the <hi>final miscarriage</hi> of them that perish, is that original cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
that befell them at the beginning, increased through the
neglect or refusal of grace offered. Others with no less favourable
countenance of Scripture, make the cause of reprobation only
the will of God, determining, freely of his own work, as
himself pleases, without respect to any second cause whatsoever.
Were we not ambitiously minded, <hi>familiam ducere,</hi> every one
to be Lord of a Sect, each of these tenents might be profitably
taught and heard, and matter of singular exhortation drawn
from either; for on the one part, doubtless it is a pious and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
intent, to endeavour to free God from all imputation of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary
rigour, &amp; his justice from seeming unjustice &amp; incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruity:
&amp; on the other side, it is a noble resolution, so to humble
our selves under the hand of Almighty God, as that we can with
patience hear, yea, think it an honour, that so base creatures as
our selves should become the instruments of the glory of so great
a majesty, whether it be by eternal life, or by eternal death,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114807:58"/>
though for no other reason, but for Gods good will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
sake. The authors of these conceits might both freely (if
peaceably) speak their mindes, and both singularly profit the
Church: for since it is impossible where Scripture is ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that all conceits should run alike, it remains, that we seek
out a way not so much to establish an unity of opinion in the
mindes of all; which I take to be a thing likewise impossible, as
to provide that multiplicity of conceit, trouble not the
Churches peace. A better way my conceit cannot reach unto,
then that we would be willing to think, that these things, which
with some shew of probability we deduce from Scripture are at
the best, but <hi>our opinions</hi> for this peremptory manner of setting
down our own conclusions under this high commanding form of
<hi>necessary truths,</hi> is generally one of the greatest causes, which
keeps the Churches this day so far asunder; when as a gracious
receiving of each other, by mutual forbearance in this kinde,
might peradventure in time bring them nearer together.</p>
                  <p>This peradventure may some man say, may content us in case
of opinion indifferent, out of which no great inconvenience by
necessary and evident proof is concluded: but what Recipe have
we for him that is fallen into some known and <hi>desperate Heresie?</hi>
Even the same with the former. And therefore anciently, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical
and Orthodox Christians, many times even in publick
holy exercise converst together without offence. It's noted in
the <hi>Ecclesiastick</hi> stories, that the <hi>Arrians</hi> and <hi>Right believers</hi> so
communicated together in holy prayers, that you could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
them till they came to the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the <hi>gloria patri,</hi>
which the <hi>Arrians</hi> used with some difference from other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.
But those were times <hi>quorum lectionem habemus virtutem
non habemus,</hi> we read of them in our books, but we have lost
the practise of their patience. Some prejudice was done unto
the Church by those, who first began to intermingle, with pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> duties, things respective unto private conceits.
For those Christian offices in the Church ought as much as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly
they may be common unto all, and not to descend to the
differences of particular opinions. Severity against, and sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
from heretical companies, took its beginning from the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:114807:59"/>
Hereticks themselves: and if we search the stories, we shall
finde that the Church did not at their first arising thrust them
from her: themselves went out, and as for severity: that which
the <hi>Donatists</hi> sometimes spake in their own defence. <hi>Illam esse
veram Ecclesiam quae prosecutionem patitur, non quae facit,</hi> she was
the <hi>true Church</hi> not which raised, but which suffered persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
was <hi>de facto</hi> true for a great space. For when heresies and
schismes first arose in the Church, all kind of violence were used
by the erring factions, but the Church seem'd not for a long
time to have known any use of a sword, but only of a buckler,
and when she began to use the sword, some of her best and
chiefest Captains much misliked it. The first law in this kind
that ever was made, was enacted by <hi>Theodosius</hi> against the <hi>Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists,</hi>
but with this restraint, that it should extend against none,
but only such as were tumultuous, and till that time they were
not so much as toucht with any <hi>mulct,</hi> though but pecuniary, till
that shameful outrage commited against Bish. <hi>Maximian,</hi> whom
they beat down with bats and clubs, even as he stood at the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar:</hi>
so that not so much the error of the <hi>Donatists,</hi> as their riots
and mutinies were by Imperial laws restrained. That the Church
had afterward good reason to think, that she ought to be <hi>salu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brior
quam dulcior,</hi> that sometimes there was more mercy in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing,
then forbearing there can no doubt be made. St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi>
(a man of as milde and gentle spirit as ever bare rule in the
Church) having according to his natural sweetness of dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
earnestly written against <hi>violent,</hi> and sharp dealing with He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="7 letters">
                        <desc>〈7 letters〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
being taught by experience, did afterward retract,
and confess an excellent use of wholsome severity in the Church.
Yet could I wish that it might be said of the Church, which
was sometimes observed of <hi>Augustus. In nullius unquam suorum
necem duravit:</hi> he had been angry with, and severely punisht ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of his kin, but he could never endure to cut any of them off by
death. But this I must request you to take only as my private
wish, and not as a censure, if any thing have been done to the
contrary. When <hi>Absolom</hi> was up in arms against his Father, it
was necessary for <hi>David</hi> to take order to curb him, and pull him
on his knees, yet we see how careful he was, he should not die,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:114807:59"/>
and how lamentably he bewail'd him in his death: what cause
was it that drove <hi>David</hi> into this extream passion? Was it doubt
of heire to the Kingdome? That could not be. For <hi>Solomon</hi> was
now born, to whom the promise of the Kingdom was made,
was it the strength of natural affection? I somewhat doubt of it.
Three year together was <hi>Absolom</hi> in banishment, and <hi>David</hi> did
not very eagerly desire to see him. The Scripture indeed notes
that the King long'd for him: yet in this longing was there not
any such fierceness of passion: for <hi>Absolom</hi> saw not the Kings face
for two years more after his return from banishment to <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi>
What then might be the cause of his strength of passion,
and commiseration in the King? I perswade my self it was the
fear of his sons final miscarriage, and <hi>reprobation,</hi> which made
the King (secure of the mercies of God unto himself) to wish
he had died in his steed, that so he might have gain'd for his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious
childe, some time of repentance. The Church who is
the common mother of us all, when her <hi>Absoloms,</hi> her unnatural
sons do lift up their hands and pens against her, must so use
means to repress them, that she forget not that they are the sons
of her womb, and be compassionate over them as <hi>David</hi>
was over <hi>Absolom,</hi> loath to unsheath either sword, but most of
all the temporal, for this were to send them with quick dispatch
to Hell.</p>
                  <p>And here I may not pass by that <hi>singular moderation of this
Church of ours<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>,</hi> which she hath most christianly exprest towards
her adversaries of <hi>Rome,</hi> here at home in her bosome above all
the reformed Churches, I have read of. For out of desire to
make the breach seem no greater, then indeed it is, and to hold
communion and Christian fellowship with her, so far as we
possibly can, we have done nothing to cut of the favourers of that
Church. The reasons of their love and respects to the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> we wish, but we do not command them to lay down:
their lay-Brethren have all means of instruction offered them.
Our Edicts and Statutes made for their restraint, are such as
serve only to awake them, and cause them to consider the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
of that cause for refusal of communion, in which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
(as they suppose) so great losses. Those who are sent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:114807:60"/>
by them, either for the retaining of the already perverted,
or perverting others, are either return'd by us back again to
them, who dispatcht them to us, or without any wrong unto
their persons, or danger to their lives, suffer an easie restraint,
which only hinders them from dispersing the poyson they
brought. And had they not been stickling in our state-business,
and medling with our Princes crown, there had not a drop of
their blood fallen to the ground; unto our Sermons, in which
the swarvings of that Church are necessarily to be taxt by us, we
do not binde their presence, only our desire is, they would joyn
with us in those <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>holy ceremonies,</hi> which are common
to them and us. And so accordingly, by singular discretion was
<hi>our Service-Book</hi> compiled by our Fore-fathers, as containing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that might offend them, as being almost meerly a <hi>compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi>
of their own <hi>Breviary</hi> and <hi>Missal,</hi> so that they shall see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in our meetings, but that they shall see done in their own,
though many things which are in theirs, here I grant they shall
not finde. And here indeed is the great and main difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
us. As it is in the controversie concerning the <hi>Cononical books
of Scripture:</hi> whatsoever we hold for Scripture, that even by
that Church is maintained, only she takes upon her to adde
much, which we cannot think safe to admit: so fares it in other
points of Faith and <hi>Ceremony;</hi> whatsoever it is we hold for faith,
she holds it as far forth as we; our ceremonies are taken from
her; only she over and above urges some things for faith, which
we take to be error, or at the best but opinion, and for cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
which we think to be superstition. So that to participate
with us, is, though not throughout, yet in some good measure
to participate with that Church: and certainly were that spirit
of charity stirring in them, vvhich ought to be, they would love
and honour us, even for the resemblance of that Church, the
beauty of which themselves so much admire. The glory of these
our proceedings, even our adversaries themselves do much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy.
So that from hence it is, that in their vvritings they traduce
our judiciary proceedings against them, for sanguinary and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent,
striving to persvvade other nations, that such as have suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by course of publick justice for religion only, and not for
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:114807:60"/>
treason have died, and pretend we what we list, our actions are
as bloody and cruel as their own: wherefore if a perfect pattern
of dealing with erring Christians were to be sought, there were
not any like unto this of ours, <hi>In qua nec saeviendi, nec errandi
per eundique licentia permittitur,</hi> which as it takes not to it self li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of cruelty, so it leaves not unto any the liberty of destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their own souls in the error of their lives. And now that
we may at once conclude this point concerning <hi>Hereticks,</hi> for
prohibiting these men access to religious disputations, it is now
too late to dispute of that, for from this that they have already
unadvisedly entred into these battels, are they become that
which they are: Let us leave them therefore as a sufficient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
and instance of the danger of intempestive and immodest
medling in Sacred disputes.</p>
                  <p>I see it may be well expected, that I should according to my
promise adde instruction for the <hi>publick Magistrate,</hi> and show
how far this precept in receiving the weak concerns him.</p>
                  <p>I must confess I intended and promised so to do, but<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> I
cannot conceive of it, as a thing befitting me to step
out of my study, and give rules for government to Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealths,
a thing befitting men of greater experience to do.
Wherefore I hope you will pardon me if I keep not that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise,
which I shall with less offence break then observe: And
this I rather do, because I suppose this precept, to concern us,
especially if not only as private men, and that in case of publick
proceeding, there is scarce room for it. Private men may pass
over offences at their pleasure, and may be in not doing it, they
do worse: but thus to do, lies not in the power of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,
who goes by laws, prescribing him what he is to do.
Princes and men in authority do many times much abuse
themselves by affecting a reputation of clemency, in pardoning
wrongs done to other men; and giving protection to sundry
offenders, against those who have just cause to proceed against
them. It is mercy to pardon wrong done against our selves,
but to denie the course of Justice to him that calls for it, and
to protect offenders, may peradventure be some inconsiderate
pity, but mercy it cannot be. All therefore that I will presume to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:114807:61"/>
advise the <hi>Magistrate</hi> is, <hi>A general inclinablenesse to merciful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And so I conclude, wishing unto them who plentifully fowe
mercy, plentifully to Reap it at the hand of God, with an
hundred fold encrease; and that blessing from God the Father
of mercies, may be upon them all, as on the sons of mercy, as
many as are the sands on the Sea-shore in multitude. The same
God grant that the words which we have heard this day. &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>I Have heard a <hi>Proverb</hi> to this sound, <hi>He that hath
a debt to pay at Easter, thinks the Lent but short:</hi>
How short this <hi>Lent</hi> hath seemed to me, who
stand indebted unto you for the remainder of
my meditations upon these words, is no mater of
consequence; to you peradventure it may have
seemed so long, that what you lately heard at
<hi>Shrovetide,</hi> now at <hi>Easter</hi> you may with pardon have forgotten. I
will therefore recal into your memories so much of my former
Meditations as may serve to open unto me a convenient way to
pursue the rest of those lessons, which then, when I last spake
unto you, the time and your patience would not permit me to
finish. But ere I do this, I will take leave a little to fit my <hi>Text</hi>
unto this time of Solemnity:</p>
                  <p>This time, you know, calls for a discourse concerning, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection
of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; of this you
hear no sound in the words, which I have read, and therefore you
conclude it a Text unbefitting the day. Indeed, if you take the
<hi>Resurrection</hi> for that <hi>glorious</hi> act of his <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> by which
through the <hi>power of his eternal Spirit</hi> he redeems himself from the
hand of the grave, and triumphs over death and hell, you shall in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:114807:62"/>
these words find nothing pertinent; But if you take this Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
for that act, by which, through the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>saving grace,</hi>
Christ the Son of righteousnes rises in our hearts, &amp; raises us from
the death of sin unto the <hi>life of righteousness,</hi> here in these words
you may perchance finde a notable branch of it. For to raise
our thoughts from this earth, and clay, and from things beneath
(and such are those, which here <hi>Abraham</hi> calls <hi>the good things of our
life</hi>) and to set them above, where <hi>Christ sits at the right hand of
God,</hi> this is that practick resurrection, which above all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
us, that other of <hi>Christ</hi> in person, in regard of us, is but a
<hi>resurrection in speculation,</hi> for to him that is dead in sin and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spasses,
and who places his <hi>good</hi> in the things of this life, Christ
is, as it were not risen at all, to such a one he is still in the <hi>grave,</hi>
and under the bands of death: But to him that is risen with
<hi>Christ,</hi> &amp; seeks the good <hi>things that are above,</hi> to him alone is Christ
risen: To know and <hi>believe</hi> perfectly the whole story of Christ's
Resurrection, what were it, if we did not practice this Resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of our own? <hi>Cogita non exacturum à te Deum, quantum cognó<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veris,
sed quantum vixeris, God will not reckon with thee, how much
thou knowest, but how well thou hast lived: Epictetus,</hi> that great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher

like of that sheep, which brought before him his <hi>hay,</hi> his <hi>grass,</hi> and
<hi>fodder,</hi> or rather that <hi>sheep,</hi> which having well digested all these,
exprest himself in fat, in flesh, and wooll? Beloved, you are the
flock of Christ, and the sheep of his hands, should the great
Shepherd of the flock call you before him, to see how you have
profited, would he content himself with this, that you had
well <hi>cond</hi> your <hi>Catechisme,</hi> that you had diligently read the
<hi>Gospel,</hi> and exactly knew the whole story of the <hi>resurrection?</hi>
would it not give him better satisfaction to finde Christ's resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection

                  <p>To make my way more fair to this, I will take leave to put
you in minde, in short, how I proceeded in the opening of
these words, when I last spake unto you out of this place: You
may be pleased to remember, that after some instruction drawn
from the first word, <hi>Son,</hi> I proceeded to consider the ensuing
words, wherein having by an <hi>Alchimie,</hi> which then I used, changed
the word [<hi>Recordare</hi>] <hi>Remember,</hi> into [<hi>Cave</hi>] <hi>Beware,</hi> and so read
my text thus, <hi>Beware thou receive not thy good things in this life,</hi> I
shewed you that we had never greater cause to consult our best
wits, what we are to do, and how we are to carry our selves,
then when the world, and outward blessings come upon us; Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this I moved this Question, <hi>Whether</hi> or no, <hi>if the things of
this world should by some providence of God knock and offer themselves
to us, we are bound to exclude them and resuse them,</hi> or <hi>we might open
and admit of them:</hi> I divided my answer according to the <hi>divers</hi>
abilities and strengths of men, first, <hi>qui potest capere capiat,</hi> he
that hath strength and spiritual wisdom to manage them, let him
receive them: But in the <hi>second</hi> place, he that is <hi>weak,</hi> let him
let strong diet alone, and <hi>feed on herbs,</hi> let him not intangle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
with more then he can manage; Let him try, <hi>quid ferre re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>susent,
Quid valeant humeri</hi>—to the <hi>first,</hi> the sum of what I spake
was this, Receive them we may, and that with out danger of a
<hi>Recepisti; first,</hi> if we so <hi>received</hi> them, as if we received them
not, <hi>secondly</hi> if we esteemed them not <hi>good, thirdly</hi> if we did not
esteem them <hi>ours:</hi> And here the time cut me off, and suffered
me not to descend unto the <hi>second</hi> part, upon which now I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to fall, <hi>Cave ne recipias, Take heed thou receive not thy good things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="64" facs="tcp:114807:63"/>In this matter of <hi>Receiving</hi> &amp; enterteining these <hi>outward</hi> and
foreign <hi>good things,</hi> there have been <hi>two</hi> wayes commended to you,
the one the more glorious, to receive them, of this we have spoken
the <hi>other</hi> the more <hi>safe,</hi> not to receive them, of this we are now to
speak; these ways are trodden by <hi>two</hi> kindes of persons, the one
is the <hi>strong</hi> man, and more virtuous, the other is <hi>weaker,</hi> but more
cautelous, the one incounters temptation, the other avoids it:
we may compare them to the two great Captains, <hi>Hannibal</hi> and
<hi>Fabius,</hi> the one ever calling for the battel the other evermore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
it. In one of these two rankes must every good man be
found; If we compare them together we shall finde, that the one
is far more excellent, the other far more in number: For to be
able to meet and check our enemy, to incounter occasions, to act
our parts in common life upon the common stage, and yet to
keep our uprightness, this indeed is truly to <hi>live,</hi> truly to <hi>serve
God,</hi> and men, and therefore God the more, because men. On
the contrary to avoid occasions, to follow that other <hi>vincendi
genus, non pugnare,</hi> to overcome the world by contemning
and avoding it, this argues a wise, indeed but a weak and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
spirit: I have often wondred at <hi>Antiquity,</hi> which doting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
upon a sequestred, a <hi>solitary,</hi> retired, and monkish life,
sticks not to give out, that all <hi>perfection</hi> is in it, whereas indeed
there is no greater argument of imperfection in good men, <hi>quam
non posse pati solem, non multitudinem, not to be able</hi> without offence
to walk the <hi>publick</hi> ways, to entertain the common occasions, but
to live onely to God and to <hi>themselves, utilis ipse sibi fortassis, in
utilis orbi,</hi> men of no great publike use, but excellent for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
<hi>Saints</hi> indeed in <hi>private,</hi> but being called forth into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
life, are like <hi>Bats</hi> in the <hi>Sun,</hi> utterly ignorant of publike pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice,
like <hi>Scheubelius</hi> a great <hi>Mathematician,</hi> but by book onely,
and not by practice, who being required sometime in an Army
to make use of his <hi>Quadrant,</hi> knew not the difference between
<hi>umbra recta,</hi> and <hi>umbra versa:</hi> yet, beloved, because this kinde of
good men is by far the greatest in number, and <hi>secondly</hi> because
it is both an <hi>usual</hi> and a dangerous error of many men, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to strength, when they are but weak, and so forgetting their
place, range themselves among the <hi>first,</hi> whereas they ought
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114807:63"/>
to have kept station among the <hi>second</hi> sort, I will take leave both
to advise my self, and all that near me, to like better of the safer,
though the weaker side, and to avoid the <hi>exprobration</hi> of a <hi>Rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pisti</hi> here in my text, simply <hi>non recipiendo, by not receiving,</hi> not <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting</hi>
at all of the outward, lower, and temporal good things,
rather than by an improvident foolhardiness to thrust our selves
upon occasions which we are unable to manage without offence.
This I am the more willing to do, because there is not among
men a greater error committed, and more frequent, than in this
kinde; for in most things in the world, men that have no skill
in them, will be content to acknowledge their ignorance, and
to give place to better experience: should we put the discussi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of some point of <hi>Scholarship</hi> to the <hi>plough-hind,</hi> or a Case in
<hi>Law</hi> to the Physician, or a point in <hi>Physick</hi> to the Lawyer, none
of these will offer to interpose, but will advise to consult with
every one in his proper mystery; but let offer be made of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys,
lands, places of honour, and preferment, and who will
excuse himself, who will acknowledge his ignorance, or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to manage them? Whereas in all the Arts and Sciences there
are not so many errors committed, as in the unskilful use of these
things, <hi>cum tamen nusquam periculosius erretur,</hi> and yet our errors
are no where so dangerous: It is therefore a thing most necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that in this behalf we advise men, either to know their <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
or to <hi>suspect</hi> their <hi>strength. Malocautior esse quam fortior, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis
saepe captus est, cautus rarissime;</hi> better to be cautelous and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
than strong, and hardy, the strong man hath been often cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated,
but the wary man very seldome. We read in many
places of <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> of a race of men, <hi>greater</hi> in bulk and
stature, than the ordinary men, unto whom men of common
inches seemed but as <hi>Grashoppers;</hi> such were the <hi>Anakims,</hi> the
<hi>Enims,</hi> the <hi>Horims,</hi> the <hi>Zamzummims,</hi> the <hi>Rephaims,</hi> and the
like, but if you read the Scriptures, you shall finde it observed
unto your hand, that the men of lesser bodies allways drove them
out; if you demand the reason, experience will answer you,
that the one went upon the opinion of strength and hardness, the
other of wary wit, and policy; it fares no otherwise with these
two orders of men, of which I have spoken, there is the <hi>Anakim,</hi>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:114807:64"/>
the man that goes forth in the conceit of his strength and valour,
there is the man of <hi>mean stature,</hi> whose strength is his wariness;
were there a survey taken of both those, it would be found,
that more by far have perished by unadvised adventuring upon
the things of this world, than by discreet and sober retiring.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, dost thou finde that thou comest on, and thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest
in the world, that the good things of this world wooe thee,
and cast themselves into thy lap, that wealth, that honours,
that abundance waits upon thee; take heed how thou presume
of thy strength to manage them, look well upon them, and see
if there be not written in the forehead of every one of them, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepisti;</hi>
but, beloved, I perceive, I deceive my self, for these
gay things of the world carry not their <hi>recepisti</hi> in their <hi>foreheads,</hi>
as they come <hi>towards</hi> us, they are <hi>smooth</hi> and <hi>fair:</hi> you can prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticate
nothing by their countenance, but <hi>serene,</hi> and <hi>summer</hi>
weather, our great master <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath told us, that if our <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi>
did look upon us, when they come to us, as they do when
they turn their back, and <hi>leave</hi> us, we would never entertain
them; these goodly things have their <hi>recepisti</hi> written in their
back, it is never discovered, till it be too late to mend it, when
death summons us, when the world, the flesh, the glory and
pomp of life turns its <hi>back &amp; leaves us,</hi> then shal you read <hi>recepisti:
Cave</hi> therefore, presume not, but be wary, and that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
avoid a <hi>recepisti, cave ne recipias,</hi> be sure thou receive not;
how many of those think you, who out of their opinion of skill
and strength, have given free entertainment to the world, have
made large use of the world, lived <hi>abundantly,</hi> fared costly,
dwelt sumptuously, clothed themselves richly, when their time
and houre came, would rather have gone out of some <hi>poor cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi>
than out of a <hi>princely palase,</hi> and lived with no noise in the
world, that so they might have died in some peace? See you
not, what some <hi>great</hi> persons in the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> have often
done? <hi>Charles</hi> 5. the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Parma,</hi> sundry others, though
they lived in all pomp and state, yet at their death, they desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be buried in a poor <hi>Capuchins hood;</hi> miserable men, If to
<hi>die</hi> in a state of perfect sequestration from the world were so
precious, so available a thing, how much more precious, more
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:114807:64"/>
available had it been, to live in it? For thus to die, not having
thus lived, is nothing else, but to give sentence against their own
life; for we shall not appear before God as we died, but as
we lived. To profess hate, and desertion of the world at our
death, as most do, to put on humiliation at our death, that live
at ease and in state all our life, this is but to be <hi>buried in a Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chins
hood;</hi> what is it, beloved, that thus reforms our judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and clears our sight at that houre? Nothing but this, all
our pleasures, all our honours, all the <hi>May-games</hi> of our life,
they now shall shew themselves unto us, and every one cry out
unto us, <hi>Recipisti, Thou hast received thy good things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, beloved, that I may a little the better strengthen with
good reason this my advice, <hi>de non recipiendo,</hi> of retiring from,
and <hi>rejecting</hi> the goodly things of the world, give me leave a little
to consult with my Topicks, and to try out of what place I may
draw some arguments, to bring you on the easier.</p>
                  <p>And first of all, were there no other reason to perswade you,
yet the very reading of this story, where I have taken my text,
would afford arguments enough; for what meant <hi>Abraham,</hi> I
beseech you, when he told the <hi>rich man, he had received his good
things?</hi> Did he use some obscure and unknown phrase, which
no circumstance of the story could open? It stands not with the
goodness of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> to tell us of our danger in unknown
language; something therefore certainly we shall finde, to <hi>open</hi>
the meaning: cast back your eye upon the <hi>description</hi> of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
whom <hi>Abraham</hi> charges with this error, and see if you
finde not a paraphrase there; the man to whom this phrase is
applied is described by the <hi>properties,</hi> of which I understand not
that any one is a <hi>virtue,</hi> first it is said, <hi>he was rich;</hi> secondly, he
<hi>ware scarlet,</hi> and <hi>soft linnen;</hi> thirdly, he was <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> he
was <hi>jovial,</hi> and feasted liberally every day; doth not this accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
description of the <hi>person</hi> shew his error? For to what other
purpose else could this description serve? Either here is his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
or this character is in vain; it seems therefore we must
conclude, that to be rich, to cloth our selves costly, to fare de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciously,
thus to do, is <hi>to receive the good things in our life,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
some favourable interpretation do help us out; but we
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:114807:65"/>
must take heed how we do <hi>de scripturis interpretationibus ludere,</hi>
dally with, and elude scripture by interpretations, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
when St. <hi>John</hi> describes the world, which he <hi>forbids</hi>
us to follow, he makes <hi>three</hi> parts of it, the <hi>lust of the flesh,</hi> the
<hi>lust of the eye,</hi> and the <hi>pride of life.</hi> Do not all these <hi>three</hi> appear
here in the <hi>character</hi> of our man? where is the <hi>lust of the eye,</hi> if it
be not in <hi>gaudy apparel?</hi> Where is the <hi>lust of the flesh,</hi> at least
one great branch of it, if it be not in the use of <hi>dainty diet?</hi>
Where is the <hi>pride of life,</hi> if not in <hi>riches?</hi> and what reason have
you now to doubt, what should be the meaning of <hi>recepisti,</hi> thou
<hi>hast received thy good things?</hi> He then that fears to hear a <hi>recepisti,</hi>
if he be <hi>rich,</hi> let him not forget to distribute, and empty those
<hi>bags,</hi> which lie up by him; if he be costly clad, let him turn
his scarlet into sackcloth; if he feed deliciously, let him turn his
<hi>costly dishes</hi> into temperance, and fasting: otherwise, what can
we plead for our selves, that we should not, as well as this man
in my <hi>text,</hi> when our time comes, hear our <hi>recepisti?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I see what it is, peradventure, that troubles you, you will
ask me, whether I will avouch it to be a sin to be <hi>rich,</hi> I
must walk warily, least I lay my self open to exception; <hi>Pelae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi>
grounding himself upon that of our <hi>Saviour.</hi> [<hi>It is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
for a rich man to enter into the Kingdome of Heaven,</hi>] taught
that lesson indeed, as the words do lie, and would by no means
grant, that a rich man could be saved; but for this the Church
noted him for an <hi>Heretick,</hi> for among his heresies this is scored
up for one, together with that, that <hi>it is not lawful to swear;</hi> but
if <hi>Pelagius</hi> had never otherwise erred, the Church might very
well have pardoned him that heresie: many times it falls out by
the reason of the hardness of our hearts, that there is more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
in pressing some truths, than in maintaining some errors:
that it is lawful sometime to <hi>sport</hi> our selves, that it is lawful to
<hi>feast</hi> at <hi>Christmas,</hi> that it is lawful to <hi>swear,</hi> and many other things
of the like nature, are all <hi>truths;</hi> yet there is no necessity we
should press them in our sermons to the people, for there is no
fear the people will ever forget these, <hi>Cavendum est ne nimium me.
minerint;</hi> better to labour that they do not too much remember
them; he that will labour in repressing the abuses, which people
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:114807:65"/>
ground upon these truths, must remember the old rule. <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quum
petendum est, ut aequum feras,</hi> he must go very near to teach
for truth the contrary falshood. To return then from this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression
to our <hi>rich</hi> man, <hi>Pelagius,</hi> I grant, was deceived, when
he shut all rich men out of the Kingdome of Heaven:
but suppose we that he had prevailed in this doctrine, that he
had wrought all the world to this bent, that the Church had
received it for Catholick doctrine, shew me, he that can, what
inconvenience would have attended this error? If every <hi>rich</hi>
man should suddenly become <hi>liberal,</hi> and disburse his moneys,
where his charity directed him; if every <hi>painted gallant</hi> did turn
his Peacocks feathers into sackcloth; if every <hi>glutton</hi> left his <hi>full
dishes,</hi> and betook himself to temperance and <hi>fasting,</hi> yea, and
thought himself in conscience bound so to do, out of fear, least
he might hear of <hi>Recepisti,</hi> I perswade my self the <hi>state of Greece</hi>
would never <hi>suffer</hi> the more for this, but the state of <hi>Christianity</hi>
would have thrived the more. Well had it been for our rich
man here, if he had been a <hi>Pelagian;</hi> for this point of <hi>Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisme</hi>
is the surest remedy, that I know, against a <hi>Recepisti;</hi>
whereas on the contrary side, by reason of the truth, many rich
and covetous persons flatter themselves in their sin, whereof
they die well conceipted, from which they had been freed, had
it been their good fortune to have been thus far deceived, and
been <hi>Pelagians.</hi> Let men therefore either quite <hi>refuse riches,</hi> if
they <hi>offer</hi> themselves, which is the advice I give, or if they will
give them acceptance, let them believe, that if they be rich,
they may be saved, but let them so <hi>live,</hi> as if they could <hi>not;</hi>
for the one shall keep them from error in their faith, the other
from <hi>sin</hi> in their <hi>Actions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A second reason, perswading us to the neglect of these so
much admired things of the <hi>world,</hi> is the consideration of certain
<hi>abuses,</hi> which they put upon us, certain <hi>fallacies,</hi> and <hi>false glosses,</hi>
by which they delude us; for I know not how, the world hath
cried them up, and hath given them goodly titles, <hi>ut vel lactis
gallinacei sperare possis haustum,</hi> as <hi>Pliny</hi> speaks; men call them
blessings and favours, and rewards, and think those men most
blest of God, who injoy most of them; these goodly titles serve
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:114807:66"/>
for nothing, but to set men on longing after them, and so fill
those, that have them, with false perswasions, and those that
have them not with despair and discontents; were they indeed
blessings; were they rewards, then were our case very evil, and
we ourselves in greater danger of a <hi>recepisti,</hi> than before: for as
<hi>Abraham</hi> here tells the man of <hi>recepiste bona, thou hast received
tby goodthings,</hi> so our <hi>Saviour</hi> tells more than once of some <hi>qui
habent mercedem,</hi> have their reward; if then we shall beg, and
receive these things at the hands of God, as a reward of our ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
we shall be no more able, when we come to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our God, to shelter our selves from an <hi>habetis mercedem,</hi>
you have your reward, then the rich man here could defend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
from a <hi>recepisti.</hi> They may indeed pass for rewards, and
blessings, and that truly too, but to a <hi>sad,</hi> and disconsolate
end; for their is no man, though never so wicked, but that
some way or other doth some good, some <hi>cup</hi> of <hi>cold water</hi> hath
been given, some small service enterprized even by the worst of
men: now God who leaves no service unrewarded, no good of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
unrespected, therefore preserves these sublunary blessings
of purpose, <hi>ut paria faciat,</hi> to <hi>clear accounts</hi> with men here, who
otherwise might seem to claim something at his hand, at that
great day; It is the question <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> makes, <hi>What honour and
dignity hath been done to Mordecai for this?</hi> God is more careful of
his honour, than <hi>Ahasuerus</hi> was; none more careful than he, to
reward every service with some honour: <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> was
no Saint, I trow, yet because of his long service in the subduing
of <hi>Tyre,</hi> God gives him <hi>AEgypt</hi> for his reward, they are the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
<hi>Ezechiels</hi> words: when therefore thou seest <hi>God</hi> willing to
bring the world upon thee, to inrich thee, to raise thee to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
<hi>suspectam habe hanc Domini indulgentiam,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith,
<hi>be jealous of this courtesie of God,</hi> or rather cry out with St. <hi>Bernard,
Misericordiam hanc nolo Domine,</hi> O Lord, <hi>I will none of this kinde
of mercy:</hi> for how knowest thou whether he reward not thee, as
he did <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> only to <hi>even accounts</hi> with thee, and shew
thee that he is not in thy debt, that thou mayest hear at the last
either a <hi>recepisti,</hi> or an <hi>habes mercedem,</hi> thou <hi>hast thy reward? O
quanta apud Deummerces, si in praesenti praemium non sperarent,</hi> saith
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:114807:66"/>
St. <hi>Hierome, O how great a reward might many men receive at the
hand of God, if they did not anticipate their reward and desire it in this
life?</hi> Why do we capitulate with him for our services? Why
not rather out of pious ambition desire to have God in our
debt? He that doth God the greatest service, and receives here
from him the least reward, is the <hi>happiest</hi> man in the world; there
goes a story of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> that praying once before the Crucifix,
the Crucifix miraculously speaks thus unto him, <hi>Benede mescrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisti
Thoma, quam ergomercedem accipies? Thou hast written well of
me, Thomas, what reward dost thou desire?</hi> To whom <hi>Aquinas</hi> is
made to <hi>answer, Nullam, Domine, praeter Teipsum; no reward,
Lord, but thyself:</hi> 'tis great pity this tale is not true, it doth so
excellently teach, what to ask of God for our reward in his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
Let God but assure thee of this reward, <hi>caetera omnia vota
Deo remittas,</hi> thou mayest very well pardon him all the rest: let
us therefore amend our language, and leave off these solecismes
and misapplied denominations of blessings, and favours, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
names too high for any thing under the <hi>moon,</hi> and at our
leisure finde out other names to express them; as for this great
esteem, which we make of the things below, it comes but from
this, that we know not the value of things above; did we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
our selves to be the heirs, and the sons of God, and knew
the price of our inheritance in Heaven, it could not be, that we
should harbour so high and honourable conceits of earthly
things; it is a famous speech of MARTIN LUTHER, <hi>Homo perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte
credens se esse haeredem et filium Dei, non diu superstes maneret, sed
statim immodico gaudeo absorberetur: Did a man indeed believe that
he is a son and heir unto God, it could not be, that such a man should
long live, but forthwith he would be swallowed up, and die of immoder ate
joy:</hi> And certainly either our not believing, or not rightly valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the things of God, or howsoever, not knowing them, is the
cause of this our languishing, and impatient longing after earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things; It is but a plain comparison which I shall use, yet
because it fits the persoa, to whom I will apply it, and because
it is <hi>Theophylacts</hi> in his Comments on St. <hi>Lukes Gospel,</hi> I will not
be ashamed to make use of it; <hi>Swine,</hi> saith he, <hi>have their eyes
so fram'd, that they cannot look up to Heaven; their keepers therefore
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:114807:67"/>
when they finde themselves troubled with their crying,</hi> are <hi>wont to cast
them upon their backs,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>and so make
them cease their crying,</hi> for that beast being amazed to see the
<hi>frame</hi> and beauty of Heaven, which before he had never seen,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> being stricken with admiration, forgets his
crying; the eyes of many men seem to be framed like those of
<hi>Swine,</hi> they are not able to cast them <hi>up</hi> to Heaven, for would
they but cast themselves upon their backs, turn their face from
earth, and view the beauty of things above, it could not be,
but all this claim, or rather clamour after earthly things should
utterly cease.</p>
                  <p>Again, (yet the more to quicken one to the neglect of these
things below) among many other <hi>fallacies,</hi> by which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude
us, I have made choice of one more, they present them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
unto us, sometimes as <hi>necessaries,</hi> sometimes as <hi>Ornaments</hi>
unto us in our course of vertue and happiness; whereas they are
but meer impertinences, neither is it any way material, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we have them yea or no; <hi>virtus censum non requirit, nudo
homine contenta est, virtue and happiness require nothing else but a
man:</hi> Thus say the Ethnickes: And <hi>Christianity</hi> much more: For
it were a strange thing that we should think that Christ came
to make <hi>virtue</hi> more chargable: In regard of virtue and <hi>piety,</hi> all
estates, all conditions, high and low, are alike: It is noted by
<hi>Petronius</hi> for the vanity of rich men, <hi>Qui solas divitias extruere
curant, nihil volunt inter homines melius credit, qua quod ipsi tenent,
those men whose minds are set upon wealth and riches, would have all
men believe that it is best so to do:</hi> But riches and poverty make no
difference, for we believe him that hath told us, there <hi>is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
Jew and Gentile, high and low, rich and poor, all are one in
Christ Jesus, Non naturae paupertas, sed opinionis est,</hi> saith S. <hi>Ambrose,
Poverty,</hi> as men call it, <hi>is but a phansie,</hi> there is no such thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
it is but a Figment, an Idol, men first framed it, and set
it up, and afterward feared it, <hi>oculi nostri tota haec lunuria est;</hi> as
some <hi>Naturalists</hi> tell us that the <hi>Rain bow</hi> is <hi>oculi opus,</hi> a <hi>thing</hi> fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
onely by the <hi>eye,</hi> so this difference, betwixt <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>poor</hi> is
but the <hi>creature</hi> of the <hi>eye. Smindyrides</hi> the <hi>Sybarite</hi> was grown
so extremely dainty, that he would grow weary with the sight of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:114807:67"/>
another mans labour, and therefore when sometime he saw a
<hi>poor</hi> man digging, and painfully labouring, he began to <hi>faint,</hi> and
<hi>pant,</hi> and requires to be removed: Beloved, when we are thus
offended to see another man meanly clad, meanly housed, meanly
traded, all this is but out of a <hi>Sybaritish</hi> ridiculous daintiness, for
all this is but to <hi>grow weary at the sight of another mans labour:</hi> would
we follow our Saviours precept, and <hi>put out this eye of ours,</hi> the
greatest part of all this vanity were quite extinguisht, for what
were all outward state and pompe imaginable, were no eye to see
or regard it?</p>
                  <p>Now, beloved, yet to see this more plainly, what is the main
end of our life? what is it, at which with so much pain and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
we strive to arrive? It is, or should be nothing else but <hi>vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>
and <hi>happiness:</hi> Now these are alike purchasable in all estates;
Poverty, <hi>disease,</hi> distress, contumely, contempt, these are as well
the object of <hi>virtue,</hi> as <hi>wealth,</hi> liberty, honor, reputation, and the
rest of that forespoken rank: <hi>Happiness</hi> therefore may as well

                     <q>And the Land cannot be cleansed of blood, that
is shed in it; but by the blood of him that
shed it.</q>
                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THese words are like unto a <hi>Scorpion:</hi> for as in that,
so in these, the self same thing is both <hi>Poyson,</hi> and
<hi>remedy.</hi> Blood is the <hi>poyson,</hi> Blood is the <hi>Remedy,</hi>
he that is stricken with the <hi>Scorpion,</hi> must take the
<hi>oyle of the Scorpion</hi> to cure him. He that hath <hi>poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son'd</hi>
a Land with the sin of blood, must yield his own blood for
<hi>Antidote</hi> to cure it. It might seem strange, that I should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
Christians thus come and deliver a speech of Blood.
For when I read the notes and characters or a Christian in holy
Scriptures, me thinks it should be almost a sin for such a one to
name it. <hi>Possess your souls in patience: by this shall men know, that
ye are my Disciples if ye love one another: peace I leave with you. The
fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace in the Holy Ghost. Lee your soft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
be known to all men: the wisdome that is from above is first pure,
then peaceable, gentle, easie to be entreated, full of mercy.</hi> It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by <hi>Avenzoar</hi> a great Physician, that he was so tender
hearted, that he could not endure to see a man let blood: he
that should read these passages of Scripture, might think that
Christians were like <hi>Avenzoar,</hi> that the <hi>sight</hi> of blood should be
enough to affright them, But is the <hi>Common Christian so soft?</hi>
                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:114807:68"/>
So tender hearted, is he so peaceable, so tame and tractable a
creature? You shall not finde two things of more different
countenance and complexion, then that Christianity which is
commended unto us in the writings of the Apostles, and Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists,
and that which is current in use and practice of the times.
He that shall behold the true face of a Christian, as it is deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phered
and painted out unto us in the books of the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and unpartially compare it with that copie or counterfeit
of it, which is exprest in the life and demeanor of common
Christians, would think them no more like then those <hi>shields of
Gold,</hi> which <hi>Solomon</hi> made, were unto <hi>those of brass,</hi> which <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoboam</hi>
made in their steed: and might suppose that the writers
of those books had brought <hi>votamagis, quam praecepta</hi> had rather
fancied to themselves some admirable pattern of a Christian,
such as they could <hi>wish,</hi> then delivered rules and laws, which
seriously and indeed ought or could be practised in common life
and conversation. St. <hi>James</hi> observes, that <hi>he which beholds his
natural face in a glass, goes his way, and immediately forgets what
manner of man he was.</hi> Beloved how careful we are to look upon
the glass, the books of holy Scriptures, I cannot easily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce.
But this I am sure of, we <hi>go our ways</hi> and quickly <hi>forget</hi>
what manner of shape we saw there. As <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi> had
both one father, <hi>Isaac;</hi> both one mother <hi>Rebecca,</hi> yet the one
was smooth and plain, the other rough and hairy, of harsh and
hard countenance, &amp; condition so these two kindes of Christians
of which but now I spake, though both lay claim to one father
and mother, both call themselves the sons of God and the sons
of the Church, yet are they almost as <hi>unlike</hi> as <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Esau;</hi>
the one smooth, gentle, and peaceable, the other rough and
harsh. The notes and characters of Christians, as they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
in holy Scriptures are <hi>patience</hi> easily putting up and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesting
of wrongs, <hi>humility,</hi> preferring all before our selves:
And St. <hi>James</hi> tells us, that <hi>the wisdom that is from above, is first
pure, then peaceable, gentle, easie to be entreated.</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
hath given the first place unto purity, and it were almost
a sin to compare Christian vertues together, and make them
strive for precedency, and place. For what <hi>Solomon</hi> saith upon
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:114807:69"/>
another occasion, is here much more true: <hi>say not why is this
thing better then that: for everything in its time is seasonable.</hi> Yet
he that shall mark how every where the Scriptures commend
unto us gentleness and <hi>meekness,</hi> and that peace is it <hi>quam nobis
Apostoli totis viribus spiritus sancti commendant,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaks,
which the Apostles endeavour with all the strength and force of
the Holy Ghost to plant amongst us, might a little invert the
words of St. <hi>James,</hi> and read them thus. <hi>The wisdome that is
from above, is first peaceable, then pure.</hi> The son of God, who is
the wisdome of the Father, and who for us men came down
from Heaven, first, and before all other vertues commended
this unto the world. For when he was born, the song of the
Angels was <hi>peace upon earth, and goodwill towards men.</hi> All his
doctrine was <hi>peace,</hi> his whole life was <hi>peaceable,</hi> and no man
<hi>heard his voice in the streets.</hi> His last legacie and bequest left
unto his disciples was the same. <hi>Peace,</hi> saith he, <hi>I leave unto
you, my peace I give unto you:</hi> As Christ, so Christians. In the
building of <hi>Solomons Temple,</hi> there was no noise of any hammer,
of any instrument of Iron: so in the spiritual building and frame
of a Christian, there is no sound of Iron, no noise of any wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons,
nothing but peace and gentleness. <hi>Ex praecepto, fidei non
minus rea ira est sine ratione suscepta, quam in operibus legis homici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi>
saith St. <hi>Austin,</hi> unadvised anger by the law of <hi>faith,</hi> is
as a great sin, as murther was by the law of <hi>Moses.</hi> As some
<hi>Physicians</hi> have thought, that in mans body <hi>the spleen</hi> hath very
little use, and might well be spared, and therefore in dealing
with sundry diseased persons, they endeavour by physick to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate,
and take away that part in them, as much as may be; so
if we look into a Christian man, as he is proposed to us in the
Gospel, we may justly marvel to what purpose God hath plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in him this faculty and passion of anger; since he hath so lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
use of it: and the Gospel in a manner doth spiritually diet,
and physick him for it, and endeavours much to abate, if not
quite to purge out that quality. Beloved we have hitherto seen
who <hi>Jacob</hi> is, and what manner of man the Christian is, that is
described unto us in holy Scripture. Let us a little consider his
Brother <hi>Esau,</hi> the <hi>Christian</hi> in passage, and who commonly in
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:114807:69"/>
the account of the world goes for one. Is he so gentle and tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable
a creature? Is his countenance so smooth, his body so
free from gall and spleen? To trie this, as the <hi>Devil sometimes
spake unto Job. Touch him in his goods, touch him in his body, and
see if he will not curse thee to thy face:</hi> so touch this man a little in
his goods, touch him in his reputation and honour; touch him
in any thing that he loves, (for this is the only way to trie how
far, these commands of peace, and forbearance, and long suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
prevail with us,) and see if he will not forget and loose
all his patience. Which of us is there that understands the
words and precepts of our Saviour in their literal sense, and as
they lie? The precepts of suffering wrong, rather then to go to
law; of yielding the coat to him that would take the cloak, of
readiness to receive more wrongs, then to revenge one: these
and all the Evangelical commands of the like nature <hi>Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento
detorquemus.</hi> We have found out favourable interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and glosses, restrictions, and evasions, to winde our selves
out of them, to shift them all off, and put them by, and yet
pass for sound and currant Christians: we think we may be just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
angry, continue long suits in law, call to the Magistrate for
revenge, yea sometimes take it into our own hands, all this and
much more we think we may lawfully, and with good reason
do, any precept of Christ to the contrary notwithstanding.
And as it usually comes to pass, the permitting and tolerating
lesser sins, opens way to greater, so by giving passage, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
to those lesser impatiences and discontents, we lay open a
gap to those fouler crimes, even of murther and bloodshed.
For as men commonly suppose that all the former breaches of
our patience, which but now I mentioned, may well enough
stand with the duties of Christians: so there are who stay not
here, but think, that in some cases it may be lawful, yea, perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
necessary, at least very pardonable for Christians pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
to seek each others blood, and put their lives upon their
swords, without any wrong to their vocation; out of this have
sprung many great inconveniences, both private and publick.
First, <hi>Laws</hi> made too favourable in case of blood-shed. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
a too much <hi>facility</hi> and easiness in Princes and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:114807:70"/>
sometimes to give pardon, and release for that crime.
Thirdly and chiefly (for it is the special cause indeed that moved
me to speak in this Argument) an <hi>over promptness</hi> in many <hi>young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
who desire to be counted men of valour and resolution, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
every sleight occasion, to raise a quarrel and admit of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meanes of composing, and ending them but by sword and
<hi>single combat.</hi> Partly therefore to shew the grievousness &amp; great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of this sin of bloodshed, and partly to give the best counsel I
can for the restraint of those conceits and errors which give way
unto it, I have made choice of these few words out of the Old
Testament which but now I read. In the New Testament there
is no precept given concerning bloodshed. The Apostles seem
not to have thought, that Christians ever should have had need
of such a prohibition. For what needed to forbid those to seek
each others blood, who are not permitted to speak over hasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
one to another, when therefore I had resolved with my self to
speak something concerning the sin of bloodshed, I was in a
manner constrain'd to reflect upon the Old Testament, and make
choice of those words. <hi>And the Land cannot be purged of blood
that is shed in it, but by the blood of him that shed it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which words for my more orderly proceeding, I will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
these two general parts: <hi>First,</hi> the greatness of the sin. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi>
the means to cleanse and satisfie for the guilt of it. The
first, that is the greatness of the sin, is expressed by two circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.
First, by the generality, extent, and largness of the guilt
of it: and secondly, by the difficulty of cleansing it. The larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and compass of the guilt of this sin, is noted out unto us in
the word <hi>Land</hi> and the <hi>Land cannot be purged.</hi> It is true in some
sense of all sins. <hi>Nemo sibi uni errat,</hi> no man sins in private, and
to himself alone; For as the Scripture notes of that action of
<hi>Jepthte,</hi> when he vowed his daughter unto God, <hi>That it became a
Custome in Israel:</hi> so is it in all sins. The error is only in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
but the example spreads far &amp; wide, and thus every man that
sins, sins against the whole <hi>Land,</hi> yea against the whole world.
For who can tell how far the example and infection of an evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
doth spread? In other sins the infection is no larger then
the disease: but this sin like a plague: one brings the infection;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:114807:70"/>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> but thousands die for it, yet this sin of bloud
diffuses and spreads it self above all other sins. For in other sins
<hi>noxa sequitur caput.</hi> The guilt of them is confined to the person
that committed them. God himself hath pronounced of them.
<hi>The Son shalt not bear the sins of the Father, the soul that sinneth shall
die the death.</hi> But the sin of blood seems to claim an exception
from this Law. If by time i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> be not purged, like the <hi>frogs</hi> of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> the <hi>whole land stank of them.</hi> It leaves a guilt upon the
whole land in which it is committed. Other sins come in like
rivers, and break their banks to the prejudice and wrong of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
persons: but this comes in like a Sea, raging and threatning
to overwhelm whole countreys. If blood in any land do lie
unrevenged, every particular soul hath cause to fear, least part
of the penalty fall on him. We read in the books of Kings that
long after <hi>Sauls</hi> death God plagued the Land of <hi>Jewry</hi> with three
years famine; because <hi>Saul</hi> in his life time had without any just
cause shed the blood of some of the <hi>Gibeonites:</hi> neither the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
ceased, till seaven of <hi>Sauls</hi> Nephews had died for it. In this
story there are many things rare and worth our observation. First,
the Generality and extent of the guilt of Blood-shed which is
the cause for which I urged it) it drew a general famine on the
whole Land. Secondly, the continuance and length of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.
It lasted full three years, and better. Thirdly, the
time of the plague; it fell long after the person offending was
dead. Fourthly, whereas it is said in my Text. <hi>That blood is
cleansed by the blood of him that shed it:</hi> here the blood of him that
did this sin, sufficed not to purge the Land from it. That despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and woful end, that besel both <hi>Saul</hi> and his Sons in that
last and fatal battel upon Mount-<hi>Gilboah,</hi> a man might think
had freed the Land from danger of blood: yet we see that the
blood of the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> had left so deep a stain, that it could not
be sponged out without the blood of seven more of <hi>Sauls</hi> off-spring.
So that in some cases it seems we must alter the words of
my Text: <hi>The Land cannot be purged of blood, but by the blood of him,
and his posterity that shed it.</hi> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> tells us that <hi>some mens sins
go before them unto judgement, and some mens sins follow after.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
here is a sin that <hi>exceedes the members</hi> of this division, for
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:114807:71"/>
howsoever it goes <hi>before,</hi> or <hi>after</hi> us unto Judgement: Yet it
hath a kinde of <hi>Ubiquity,</hi> and so runs afore, so follows us at the
heels, that it stays behinde us too, and calls for vengeance long
after that we are gone. Blood unrevenged passes from Father
to Son like an Heirlome or legacy: and he that dies with blood
hanging on his fingers, leaves his Off-spring and his Family as
pledges to answer it in his stead. As an Engineer that works in
a Mine, lays a train, or kindles a Match, and leaves it behinde
him, which shall take hold of the powder long after he is gone,
so he that sheds blood, if it be not be times purged, as it were
kindles a Match able to blow up not only a Parliament, but even
a whole Land where blood lies unrevenged.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, another circumstance serving to express unto us the
greatness of this sin; I told you was the difficulty of cleansing it;
intimated in those words, <hi>cannot be cleansed but by the blood of him
that shed it.</hi> Most of other sins have sundry ways to wash the guilt
away. As in the <hi>Levitical Law,</hi> the woman that was unclean by
reason of <hi>Childe-bearing,</hi> might offer a pair of <hi>Turtle-doves,</hi> or
two young <hi>Pigeons:</hi> so he that travels with other sins, hath either
a <hi>Turtle</hi> or a <hi>Pigeon,</hi> he hath more ways then one to purifie him:
prayer unto God, or true repentance, or satisfaction to the party
wronged, or bodily affliction, or temporary mulct. But, he that
travels with the sin of Blood, for him there remains no sacrifice
for sin, but a fearful expectation of vengeance, he hath but one
way of cleansing, onely his blood, the <hi>blood of him that
shed it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second general part which we considered in these words,
was, that one mean which is left to cleanse blood exprest in the
last words, <hi>the blood of him that shed it.</hi> The Apostle to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi>
speaking of the sacrifices of the Old Testament, notes that
without blood, there was no cleansing no forgiveness. He spake
it only of the blood of beasts of Bulls and Goats, who therefore
have their blood that they might shed it in mans service, and for
mans use. But among all the Levitical Sacrifices there was not
one to cleanse the man-slayer: For the blood of the cattle upon
a <hi>thousand Hills</hi> was not sufficient for this, yet was that sin to be
purged with blood too, and that by a more constant and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:114807:71"/>
Law, then that of Sacrifices. For the cleansing of other sins
by blood is done away; the date of it is out; but to cleanse
blood by blood remains as a Law to our times, and so shall unto
the worlds end, <hi>sanguine quaerendi reditus,</hi> out of blood no way
to get but by blood, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: saith <hi>S. Basil,</hi> hast
thou shed blood? wouldst thou be free from the guilt of it. Thy
best way is to be a Martyr, and shed thy blood for Christs sake.
Now that what I have to say may the better be conceived and
lodged up in your memories, I will comprehend and order all
that I will speak to under three heads. First I will in General
yet a little further, briefly shew how great a sin the sin of blood
is. Secondly I will speak of the redress of some misorders ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
frequent in our age which give way to this sin, especially pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
revenge and single combat. Thirdly I will touch at the
means of taking the guilt of blood away, which here the holy
Ghost commends to those which are set in authority to that
purpose. And first of the greatness of the crime and sin of
blood.</p>
                  <p>Of sins in holy Scripture there be two sorts recorded. One
sort is a silent, dumb and quiet sin. God doth as it were seek after
it to finde it, as the people did after <hi>Saul,</hi> when he was hidden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
the stuff. Of this nature are the ordinary sins of our
life, which do more easily finde pardon at the hands of God;
but there is a second sort of sin, which is a vocal and a crying sin, a
sin like that <hi>importunate widow</hi> in the Gospel, that will not suffer
the Judge to be quiet, till he hath done justice: and those are
the more heavy and grievouser sins of our lives. Of this second
sort, there are two sins, to which the Scripture doth attribute
this crying faculty. First the sin of <hi>Sodom;</hi> For so God tells <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,
The cry of Sodom and Gomorrha is come up before me.</hi> The
second is the sin of which I am now to speak, the sin of Blood-shed.
For so God tells <hi>Cain.</hi> The <hi>voice of thy brothers blood cryes
unto me from the earth,</hi> The sin of <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradise doubtless was
a great and hainous sin, which hath thus made us all the <hi>children
of death,</hi> yet it seems to be but of the rank of <hi>mute sins,</hi> and to
have had no <hi>voyce</hi> to betray it, God comes unto <hi>Adam,</hi> convents
him, examines him as if he had not known it, and seems not to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:114807:72"/>
believe any such thing was done, till himself had confessed it.
But blood is an unmannerly, importunate, and clamorous sin,
God shall not need to come and enquire after it, it will come
up unto him, and cry as the souls do under the altar in the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
<hi>How long Lord, how long? Nec patimur—iracunda Deum
ponere fulmina,</hi> suffers not God to forget judgement, or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
a thought of mercy. To satisfie therefore the cry of this
importunate sin, and to shew men the grievousness of it, the
Laws of God and men have wonderfully conspired in the aveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of blood; by what means, or by what creature soever it
were shed. Beasts, unreasonable creatures, though whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they do, they cannot be said to sin: for whatsoever they do,
they do by force of that natural instinct, by which they are guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and led as by their proper law: yet mans blood if they shed
it, is revenged upon them. God himself is the Author of this
law, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 9.) where he tells <hi>Noah; The blood of your lives I will
require, at the hands of every beast will I require it.</hi> And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
in the 21. of <hi>Exodus,</hi> he precisely enacts a law. <hi>De Bove
petulco, If an Oxe gore a man that he die, the Oxe shall be slain, and
the flesh cast away as an abomination.</hi> The laws of Natural men,
who had no knowledge of God, come little behinde this; yea,
they may seem to have gone before it in severe revenging of
blood: for amongst the laws, by which <hi>Athens</hi> that famous
city of <hi>Greece</hi> was governed, there was one, that if a <hi>Wall</hi> by
chance had fallen down, and slain a man as the tower of <hi>Siloam</hi>
did, of which we read in the Gospel; that then the Judges
should sit, and formally arraign that wall, condemn it, and
throw the stor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>s of it out of the Countrey. This so formal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
against unreasonable, against dull and senseless crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
hath been thus joyntly both by God and man practised on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for our example, to teach us how precious the life of man
ought to be in our eyes: and it resembles that action of Christ
in the Gospel, where for our instruction he curses the barren
fig tree: <hi>Sterilitas nostra in ficu vapulat,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Now as exemplary justice is severely done on these creatures
for mans instruction: so much more if man himself kept not his
hands clean from blood, did the laws of God proceed with
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:114807:72"/>
much strictness and severity: for to say nothing of gross, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious,
and wilful murther; if a man only in <hi>his haste</hi> strook an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
with a weapon, or with a stone, so that he died, though
the striker intended but to hurt, yet he was to die for it. That
he did it in anger, that he did it in his drink, that he did it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vok't,
that he did it in defence of his honour, and reputation:
none of all these pretenses might excuse him. Nay, which is
yet more, God himself propounds the case; <hi>If</hi> saith he, <hi>a man
cleaving wood his axe head flie off, and hit his neighbour, so that he
kills him,</hi> except he could recover one of the Cities of Refuge,
he was to die: and having recovered a city of refuge, if before
the death of the high Priest, he were taken without the walls of
the city, he was to die. So strickt was God in the case of
chance-medly, (as they call it,) in a case which he takes unto
himself, and makes himself the Author of. For in the 21. of
<hi>Exodus,</hi> speaking of the man that thus sheds blood by chance and
unwittingly, his words are these; If a man lie not in wait <hi>sed
Deus objecerit manui ejus,</hi> but God put him into his hands, I will
appoint him a city of refuge to flie unto. In which words God
acknowledges, that he who thus dies by chance, dies by his
providence, and not by the sin of him that slue him. If God
(saith he) shall put him into his hands; yet you see, what a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty
he layes upon the innocent instrument of such blood shed.
The blood that is shed in battle, and in times of lawful war you
all suppose as lawfully shed. Yet notwithstanding <hi>Moses</hi> in the
16. of <hi>Numbers,</hi> gives charge, that the souldiers returning from
battel, should stay a while without the Camp, even <hi>seven days,</hi>
until they were <hi>cleansed.</hi> Again, when <hi>David</hi> advised with
himself about the building of an house unto God, he sends him
word to lay by all thought of that: he was no fit person to do it;
and he gives the reason of it. <hi>Quia vir bellorum &amp; sanguinum es tu.</hi>
For thou art a man hast shed much blood, and fought ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
battels. Beloved the battels which <hi>David</hi> fought were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Lords battels, and therefore whatsoever he did in that
kinde, he had doubtless very good warrant to do: and yet you
see, that it is an imputation to him, that he shed blood, though
lawfully, <hi>ut fundi sanguis ne juste quidem, sine aliquâ injustitiâ pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sit;</hi>
                     <pb n="84" facs="tcp:114807:73"/>
so that it seems blood cannot be so justly shed, but that it
brings with it some stain and spot of injustice.</p>
                  <p>All this have I said to raise up in you as much as possibly I
can, a right conceit of the height and hainousness of this sin, and
further, yet to effect this in you, as in the beginning and entrance
into my discourse, I briefly toucht at two reasons, shewing the
greatness of this sin, occasion'd therunto by the words of my text:
so will I as briefly touch at the two more tending to the same
purpose; one drawn from respect of the wrong, which by this
sin is done unto God; another from the wrong done to our
selves. And first, what wrong is done unto God, God himself
shews us in the 9. of <hi>Genesis:</hi> where giving this for an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
law. He that sheddeth mans blood, by man let his blood
be shed; he presently addes the reason of it. <hi>For in the image
of God made he man:</hi> we shall the better understand the force of
this reason, if we a little look into civil actions. It is the usual
manner of subjects, when they rebel against the Prince, to think
they cannot more effectually express their hate; then by disgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,
breaking, throwing down the statues and <hi>images</hi> erected to
his honor. The citizens of <hi>Antioch</hi> in a sedition against <hi>Theodosius</hi>
the Emperor, in one night disgracefully threw down all his sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
which fact of theirs caus'd S. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> at that time preacher
to that city, to make those famous Sermons, which from that
action to this day are called his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> his statues. This by
so much the more is counted a great offence, because next unto
wronging and disgracing the very person of the Prince, a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
insolence cannot be offered. For it expresseth with what
welcome they would entertain him, if they had him in their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.
Beloved man is the image of his maker erected by him as
a <hi>Statue</hi> of his honour. He then that shall despitefully handle,
batter and deface it, how can he be counted otherwise then guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of highest Treason against his Maker. <hi>Rebellion,</hi> saith <hi>Samuel</hi>
to <hi>Saul, is like the sin of superstition and Idolatry.</hi> The sin of blood
therefore equals the sin Idolatry, since there cannot be a greater
sin of Rebellion against God, then to deface his image. Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
through ignorance sets up a false image of God, but this sin
through malice defaces, pulls down the true. Amongst the
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:114807:73"/>
heathen, sometimes the statues of the Emperours were had in
such respect, that they were accounted sanctuaries, and such as
for offence fled unto them, it was not lawful to touch. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
such honour ought we to give unto a man, that if he have
offended us, yet the image of God which shines in him ought
to be as a sanctuary unto him, to save him from our violence,
an admonitioner unto us, that we ought not to touch him. A
second reason. yet further shewing the hainousness of this sin,
is drawn from the wrong which is done to our selves. All other
wrongs whatsoever they be admit of some recompence. Honors,
wealth, preferments, if they be taken from us, they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
as they did unto <hi>Job</hi> in far greater measure, and the party
wronged may receive full and ample satisfaction; but what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
may be made to a man for his life? When that is
gone, all the Kingdomes which our Saviour saw in the Mount,
and the glory of them, are nothing worth, neither is all the
world, all the power of men and Angels able to give the least
breath to him that hath lost it. Nothing under God is able to
make satisfaction for such a wrong: the revenge that is taken
afterward upon the party that hath done the wrong, cannot be
counted a recompence. That is done <hi>In terrorem viventium, non
in subsidium mortuorum.</hi> It serves to deter the living from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
the like outrage, but it can no way help him that is
dead: <hi>David</hi> at the same time committed two sins, great sins,
<hi>Murther</hi> and <hi>Adultery;</hi> the reward of either of which by Gods
law, is nothing else but death. Yet for his <hi>Adultery</hi> he seems to
make some satisfaction to the party wronged; for the text notes
that <hi>David</hi> took her to his wife, made her his Queen, and that
he went in unto her, comforted her: all which may well be
counted at least a part of recompence. But for dead <hi>Vrias</hi> what
means could <hi>David</hi> make to recompence, to comfort him. For
this cause I verily suppose it is, that in his penitential Psalm,
wherein he bewails his sin, he makes no particular confession,
no mention of his Adultery: but of the other, of blood, he is
very sensible, and expresly prayes against it. <hi>Deliver me from
blood guiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation;</hi> as if Adultery
in comparison of murder were no crime at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="86" facs="tcp:114807:74"/>I am sorry I should have any just occasion amongst Christian
men, so long to insist upon a thing so plain; and shew that the
sin of blood is a great and hainous sin. But he that shall look
into the necessities of these times, shall quickly see that there is a
great cause, why this doctrine should be very effectually prest.
For many things are even publickly done, which in part argue
that men esteem of this sin much more sleightly then they ought.
<hi>Aristotle</hi> observed it of <hi>Phaleas,</hi> (one that took upon him, to
prescribe laws, by which a common wealth might as he thought,
well be governed,) that he had taken order for the preventing
of smaller faults, but he left way enough open to greater crimes.
Beloved, the error of our laws is not so great as that of <hi>Phaleas</hi>
was, yet we offend too, though on the contrary, and the less
dangerous side; for great and grievous sins are by them provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
curbed, but many inferiour crimes finde many times too
free passage. Murther, though all be abominable, yet there
are degrees in it, some is more hainous then other. Gross,
malicious, premeditated and wilful murther, are by our laws,
so far as humane wisdome can provide, sufficiently prevented:
but murders done in haste, or besides the <hi>intent</hi> of him that did
it, or in point of <hi>honour,</hi> and reputation, these finde a little too
much favour; or laws in this respect are somewhat defective,
both in preventing that it be not done, and punishing it when it
is done; men have thought themselves wiser then God, presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to moderate the unnecessary severity (as they seem to
think) of his laws. And hence it comes to pass, that in mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
companies, and in all great cities and places of <hi>Mart</hi> and
concourse few moneths, yea, few weeks pass without some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
and example of blood-shed, either by suddain quarrel,
or by challenge to <hi>Duel</hi> and single combate. How many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in a short space have we seen of young men, men of hot
and fiery disposition, mutually provoking and disgracing each
other, and then taking themselves bound in high terms of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
and honour, to end their quarrels by their swords? That
therefore we may the better discover, the unlawfulness of chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
and private combate; let us a little enquire and examine
in what cases blood may lawfully, and without offence be shed;
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:114807:74"/>
that so we may see where, amongst these, <hi>single combate</hi> may
finde its place.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Manichees</hi> were of opinion that it was not lawful to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
any thing in which there was life, and therefore they would
not pull a branch from a tree, because foresooth there was life
in it. To think that mans life may be in no case taken from him,
is but a <hi>branch of Manichisme:</hi> and the words of my text do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
cross it, where it is laid down, that for the <hi>cleansing of
blood, blood may and must be shed.</hi> For the avoiding therefore of the
extream, we are to note that the lawful causes of bloodshed are
either publick or private, publick cases are two: First in case of
Justice, when a malefactor dies for his sin by the hand of the
Magistrate. Secondly in case of publick war and defence
of our Countrey, for the Doctrine of Christ is not (as some have
supposed) an enemy to Souldiership, and Military Discipline.
When <hi>John</hi> the Baptist began to Preach Repentance, and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Life; amongst those that came forth to understand and
learn their duty, the Text saith that the Souldiers came and ask't
<hi>him Master what shall we do.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> wills them not to lay down
their weapons; or to take another course of life (which he
ought and would have done, if that course had been unlawful)
but he instructs them rather in their calling. For he gives them
these two Lessons, <hi>Do no man wrong, And be content with your pay,
your wages.</hi> Then which there could not have been better, or more
pertinent counsel given to Souldiers, they being the two principal
vices of Souldiers to wrong places where they live by forrage,
and pillage and to mutiny in dislike of their pay. When Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> came to Preach to the <hi>Centurion</hi> in the Acts we finde not a
syllable in all that Sermon prejudicial to a Souldiers profession.
And therefore accordingly in the times of the Primitive Church
Christians served even under Heathen Emperours, and that with
the approbation of God himself.</p>
                  <p>For in the Ecclesiastick story we read of the <hi>Legio Fulminatrix
of</hi> a band of Souldiers called the <hi>Thundring Band.</hi> Because that
at what time <hi>Marcus</hi> the Emperour lying with his Army in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie</hi>
was afflicted with a great drought, and in great danger of
the enemy, when they were now about to joyn battel, the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:114807:75"/>
Souldiers, (that Band) fell flat on their faces, and by their
instant prayers obtained of God a great Tempest which to the
Emperour and his army, brought store of cold refreshing water,
but upon the enemy nothing else but fire and whirl-wind. The
Emperors Epistle in which this story is related, is this day extant,
recovered by <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> who lived about the time the thing
was done: wherefore we may not doubt of the lawfulness of
that profession, which it hath pleased God thus to grace, and
honour with such a miracle. Besides these two there are no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
publick causes of blood-shed. As for the causes in private,
I know but one, and that is when a man is set upon and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to it, in his own defence. If a thief be robbing in the <hi>night,</hi>
and be slain, the Law of God acquits him that did it: and by the
Roman Laws, <hi>Nocturnum furem quomodo libet, diurnum si se telo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenderit,</hi>
it was lawful to kill a thief by night at any hand, and by
day if he used his weapon, of private blood-shed there is no cause
but this &amp; this we must needs allow of. For in all other private
necessities into which we may be driven, the Law and Magistrate
have place to whom we must repair for remedy: but in case of
defence of life against sudden on set, no law can be made except
we would make a Law to yield our throats to him that would
cut them, or our Laws were like the <hi>Prophet</hi> that came to <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>
at <hi>Bethel,</hi> and could dry up mens arms that offered violence,
wherefore all cause of death, one onely excepted, is publick and
that for great reason. For to die is not a private action to be
undertaken at our own, or at any other private mans pleasure,
and discretion. For as we are not born unto our selves alone, but
for the service of God and the common-wealth in which we live:
so no man dies to himself alone but with the damage and loss of
that Church or common-wealth of which he is a member.
Wherefore it is not left to any private mans power to dispose of
any mans life, no not to our own, only God and the Magistrate
may dispose of this. As Souldiers in the camp must keep their
standing, neither may they move or alter, but by direction from
the captain: so is it with us all. Our life is a warfare and every
man in the world hath his station, and place from whence he
may not move at his own, or at another mans pleasure, but only
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:114807:75"/>
at the direction and appointment of God, his General, or of the
Magistrates, which are as Captains &amp; Lievtenants under him. Then
our lawful times of death are either when our day is come, or to
fall in battel, or for misdemeanor to be cut off by the publick
hand of Justice, <hi>Ut qui vivi prodesse noluerunt, eorum morte respub,
utatur.</hi> He which otherwise dies, comes by surreption and
stealth, and not warrantably unto his end.</p>
                  <p>And though we have spoken something in Apology and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of War, yet you may not think, that in time of War your
hands are loose, and that you may at your pleasure shed the
blood of your enemy. <hi>Misericorditer etiam bella gerantur,</hi> saith
S. <hi>Austine,</hi> even in war and battel there is room for thoughts of
peace and mercy and therefore many of the ancient <hi>Heroes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned
Souldiers and Captains were very conscientious of shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the blood of their enemies, except it were in battel, and
when therewas no remedy to avoid it. In that mortal battel,
<hi>Sam.</hi> 2. between the Servants of <hi>David</hi> and the servants of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bosheth;</hi>
the Scripture reports that <hi>Abner</hi> fled, And <hi>Azael Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abs</hi>
brother following him hard at heels to kill him, <hi>Abner</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises
him twise, <hi>Turn aside,</hi> saith he, <hi>why should I smite thee to the
ground.</hi> But when <hi>Azahel</hi> would not hearken but followed him
still for his blood, then he stroke him with his spear, that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
In the time of War when he might lawfully have done it,
in the fury of the battel <hi>Abner</hi> would not shed blood, but by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint.
<hi>Xenophon</hi> would make us believe that the Souldiers in
<hi>Cyrus</hi> his army were so well disciplin'd, that one of them in time
of the battel, having lift up his arm to strike his enemy, hearing
the Trumpet begin to sound the retreat, let fall his arm and
willingly lost his blow because he thought the time of striking
was now past: So far were these men from thinking it lawful to
shed the blood of a Subject in the time of peace, that they would
not shed the blood of an enemy in time of war except it were in
the field. <hi>J. Cesar</hi> was one of the greatest, &amp; stoutest Captains that
ever was in the World, he stood the shock of fifty set battels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
all sieges and outroads, he took a thousand Cities and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Towns; he overrun three hundred severall countreyes, and in
his wars were slain well near twelve hundred thousand men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:114807:76"/>
all those that died in the civil wars, which were great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
yet this man protested of himself, and that most truly
that he never drew blood but in the field, <hi>nunquam nisi in acie
stantem</hi> never slew any man, but in a set battel, I have been a little
the bolder in bringing these instances of heathen men. First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the Doctrine of Christ, through error is counted an enemy
to policie of War and Martial Discipline. Secondly, because we
have found out many distinctions, and evasions to elude the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of our Blessed Saviour and his Apostles. For as it hath
been observed of the God-makers, I mean the <hi>Painters</hi> and <hi>Statu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries</hi>
among the heathen, they were wont many times to paint
their Goddesses like their mistresses, and then think them most
fair, when they were most like what they best loved: so is it
with many professors of Christian Religion they can temper the
precepts of it to their liking, and lay upon them glosses and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations
as it were colours, and make it look like what they
love. Thirdly, because it is likely that the examples of these men
will most prevail with those to whom I speak as being such to
whom above all they affect to be most like. Except therefore it
be their purpose to hear no other Judgement but only their own
unruly and misorderly affections; it cannot but move them to see
the examples of men guided only by the light of reason, of men
I say the most famous in all the world for valour and resolution
to run so mainly against them. To come then unto the question
of <hi>Duels;</hi> both by the light of reason, and by the practice of men
it doth appear, that there is no case, wherein subjects may pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatly
seek each others lives. There are extant the Laws of the
<hi>Jews</hi> framed by God himself. The Laws of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire
made partly by the <hi>Ethnick,</hi> partly by <hi>Christian</hi> Princes; A great
part of the Laws of <hi>Sparta,</hi> and <hi>Athens</hi> (two warlike Common-Wealths
especially the former) lie dispersed in our books: yet
amongst them all is there not a Law or Custome that permits
this liberty to Subjects. The reason of it I conceive, is very plain.
The principal thing next under God by which a Common-Wealth
doth stand is the Authority of the Magistrate whose pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
end is to compose, and end quarrels between man and man
upon what occasion soever they grow; For were men peaceable,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:114807:76"/>
were men not injurious one to another, there were no use of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
Wherefore to permit men in private to try their
own rights, or to avenge their own wrongs, and so to decline the
sentence of the Magistrate is quite, to cut off all use of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Indeed it hath been sometimes seen that the event of a battel
by consent of both armies, hath been put upon single combat, to
avoid further effusion of blood: but combats betwixt Subjects
for private causes till these later ages of the world was never al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.
Yet I must confess the practice of it is very Ancient. For
<hi>Cain</hi> the second man in the world was the <hi>first Duelist,</hi> the first
that ever challenged the field (in the fourth of <hi>Genesis</hi>) the Text
saith, That <hi>Cain</hi> spake unto his Brother, and when they were in
the field he arose and slew him. The <hi>Septuagint,</hi> to make the
sense more plain do adde another clause, and tell us what it was
he said unto his Brother, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> Let us go out
<hi>into the field,</hi> and when they were in the field, he arose and slew
him. <hi>Let us go out into the field,</hi> it is the very form and proper
language of a challenge. Many times indeed our Gallants can
formalize in other words, but evermore the substance, and usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the very words are no other but these of <hi>Cains, Let us go out
into the field. Abel</hi> I perswade my self understood them not
as a challenge: for had he so done, he would have made so
much use of his discretion, as to have refused it, yet can we
not chuse but acknowledge a secret Judgement of God in this
that the words of <hi>Cain,</hi> should still be so Religiously kept till this
day as a Proem and Introduction to that action, which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
is no other, then what <hi>Cains</hi> was. When therefore our Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants
are so ready to challenge the field, and to go into the field,
Let them but remember whose words they use, and so accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
think of their action. Again, notwithstanding, Duels are
of so ancient and worshipful a Parentage, yet could they never
gain so good acceptance as to be permitted, much less to be
counted lawful in the civil part of the world till barbarisme had
overran it. About five or six hundred years after Christ at the
fall of the Roman Empire aboundance of rude and barbarous
people brake in and possest the civiler part of the world; who
abolishing the ancient Laws of the Empire, set up many strange
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:114807:77"/>
customs in their rooms. Amongst the rest for the determining of
quarrels that might arise in case of doubtful title, or of false ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation
or the like, they put themselves upon many unusual
forms of Tryal; as to <hi>handle red hot Iron,</hi> to walk <hi>bare foot on
burning coals,</hi> to put their hands and feet in <hi>scalding water,</hi> and many
other of the like nature, which are reckoned up by <hi>Hottoman</hi> a
French Lawyer: For they presumed so far on Gods providence,
that if the party accused were innocent, he might do any of these
without any smart, or harm. In the same cases, when by reason
of unsufficient, and doubtful evidence, the Judges could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to sentence, as somtimes it falls out and the parties contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
would admit of no reasonable composition, Their manner
was to permit them to trie it out by their swords. That so the
Conqueror might be thought to be in the right. They permitted,
<hi>Isay,</hi> thus to do. For at the best 'twas but a permission to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
farther mischief; For to this end sometimes some known a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses
are tolerated: So God permitted the Jews upon sleight
occasions to put their wives away, Because he saw that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
their exorbitant lusts would not be bounded within these
limits, which he in Paradise in the beginning had ser.</p>
                  <p>And it is observed of the wise men which had the managing
and bringing up of <hi>Nero</hi> the Emperor, that they suffered him to
practice his lusts upon <hi>Acte</hi> one of his Mothers Chamber-maids,
<hi>Ne in stupra foeminarum illustrium perrumperet si ill â libidine prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beretur.</hi>
Least if he were forbidden that, he should turn his lust
upon some of the Noble Women, permission and toleration
warrants not the goodness of any action. But as <hi>Caiphas</hi> said bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
one man die then all the people perish; so they that first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<hi>Duels</hi> seem to have thought: better one or two mutinous
persons, and disorderly die in their folly, then the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth
be put into tumult and combustion: yet even by
these men it was never so promiscuously tolerated that every
hasty couple, upon the venting of a little choler, should presently
draw their swords, but it was a publick or solemn action, done
by order, with inspection, either of the Prince himself, or of
some other Magistrate, appointed to order it. Now certainly
there can be no very great reason for that action, which was thus
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:114807:77"/>
                     <hi>begun by Cain,</hi> and <hi>continued only by Goths and Vandals</hi> and meer <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barisme.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet that we may a little better acquaint our selves with the
quality of it, Let us a little examine the causes and pretences
which are brought by them who call for trial by single combat.
The causes are usually two. First, disdain to seem to do or suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
any thing for <hi>fear of death.</hi> Secondly, <hi>point of Honour,</hi> and not
to suffer any contumely, and indignity, especially if it bring
with it disreputation, and note of cowardise. For the first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
to fear death. I must confess I have often wondered with
my self, how men durst die so ventrously except they were
sure they died well. <hi>In aliis rebus siquid erratum est potest post
modum corrigi,</hi> in other things which are learnt by practising, if
we mistak we may amend it: for the errour of a former A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
may be corrected in the next. We learn then by er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and men come at length not to erre, by having of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
erred. But no man learns to die by practising it. We
die but once, and a fault committed then, can never af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
be amended, <hi>quia poena, statim sequitur errorem,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
the punishment immediately follows upon the errour.
To die is an action of that moment, that we ought to be
very well advised, when we come to it, <hi>ab hoc momento
pendet aeternitas,</hi> you may not look back upon the opinion of
honour and reputation which remains behinde you: but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
look forward upon that infinite space of Eternity either
of bliss or bale which besalls us immediately after our
last breath. To be loath to die upon every slight oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
is not a necessary sign of fear and cowardise. He
that knew what life is, and the true use of it, had he many lives
to spare, yet would he be loth to part with one of them upon
better terms then those our books tell us, that <hi>Aristippus</hi> a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher
being at Sea in a dangerous <hi>Tempest,</hi> and bewray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
some fear, when the weather was cleared up, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate
Ruffian came and upbraided him with it and tells
him, that it was ashame that he professing wisedome
should be afraid of his life, whereas himselfe having
had no such education, exprest no agony or dread at all. To
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:114807:78"/>
whom the Phylosopher replied, there was some difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them two. <hi>I know</hi> saith he, <hi>my life may be profitable many
ways, and therefore am I loth to loose it; but because of your life you know
little profit, little good can be made, you care not how easily you part
with it.</hi> Beloved it may be justly suspected, that they who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem
thus lightly of their lives, are but worthless and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
men: our own experience tells us, that men who are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal
of their money in Taverns and Ordinaries, are close hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
enough, when either pious uses, or necessary and publick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
requires their liberality. I have not heard that <hi>prodigals</hi>
ever built <hi>Churches.</hi> So these men that are so prodigal of their
lives in base quarrels, peradventure would be cowardly enough;
if either publick service, or religion did call for their help; I
scarcely believe any of them would die Martyrs, if the times so
required it. Beloved, I do not go about to perswade any man
to fear death, but not to contemn life; life is the greatest bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
God gives in this world, and did men know the worth of it,
they would never so rashly venture the loss of it, but now lightly
prizing both their own and others blood, they are easily moved
to shed it, as fools are easily won to part with jewels, because
they know not how to value them. We must deal with our
lives, as we do with our money, we must not be covetous of it,
desire life for no other use but to live, as covetous persons desire
mony only to have it: neither must we be prodigal of life and
trifle it away upon every occasion: but we must be liberal of
our lives, know upon what occasion to spare, upon what occasion
to spend them. To know where and when and in what cases to
offer our selves to die, is a thing of greater skill, then a great
part of them suppose, who pretend themselves most forward to
do it. <hi>Nam impetu quodam &amp; instinctu currere ad mortem cum multis
commune est.</hi> For brutishly to run upon and hasten unto death is
a thing that many men can do; and we see that bruit beasts
many times will run upon the spears of such as pursue them. <hi>Sed
deliberare &amp; causas expendere utque suaserit ratio vitae mortisque con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silium
suscipere, vel ponere ingentis animi est,</hi> but wisely to look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
and weigh every occasion, and as judgement and true discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
shall direct: so to entertain a resolution either of life or
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:114807:78"/>
death this were true fortitude and magnanimity. And indeed this
prodigality and contempt of life, is the greatest ground of this
quarrellous and fighting humour. <hi>Qui suam vitam contempsit, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus
est alienae.</hi> There is a kinde of men, who because they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
their own lives, make themselves Lords and Commanders
of other mens, easily provoking others to venture their blood,
because they care not how they loose their own. Few places of
great resort are without these men, and they are the greatest oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioners
of bloodshed, you may quickly know them. There are
few quarrels wherein they are not either principalls, or seconds,
or some way or another will have a part in them. Might there
be publick order taken for the restraint of such men, that make
a practice of quarrelling, and because they contemne their own
lives, carry themselves so insolently and imperiously towards o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
It will prevent much mischief, and free the Land of much
danger of blood guiltiness.</p>
                  <p>The second cause, which is much alledged in defence of <hi>Duels,</hi>
I told you was point of honour, a conceit that it is dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
for men of place and fashion quietly to digest and put up
contumelye and disgrace, and this they take to be a reason of that
authority and strength, as that it must admit of no dispensation;
For answer. First, the true fountain and original of quarrel are
of another kinde and honour is abused as a pretence. The first
occasioners of a great part of them are indeed very dishonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,
let there an <hi>Inventory</hi> be taken of all the challenges that
have been made for some time past, and you shall finde that the
greatest part by far were raised either in Taverns, or Dicing
houses, or in the stews. Pardon me, if in a case of this nature
I deal a little plainly. <hi>Drinking, Gaming,</hi> and <hi>Whores,</hi> these are
those rotten bones that lie hid under this <hi>painted Sepulchre</hi> and
title of honour.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, To conclude, It is a part of our profession, as we are
Christians to suffer wrong and disgrace. Therefore to set up
an other doctrine, and teach that honour may plead prescripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against Christs precepts, and exempt you from patient endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of contumely and disgrace, you withstand Christ,
and denie your vocation; and therefore are unavoidably Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stats.

But we loose our labour, who give young men and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setled

yet if you cast a little dust amongst them are presently parted,

quickly allay this greatness of stomach and fighting humour.

St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes it the property of charity to hide the multitude of
sins: whose property then is it thus to blazon them at mid-day,
and to fill the ears of the world with the report of them? <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi>
the first-born among Christian Emperours, so far
mislik't this course, that he professed openly, if he found any
of his Bishops and Clergy, whom it especially concerned to
have a reputation pure and spotless, committing any grievous
sin, to hide it from the eye of the world, he would cover it with
his own garment: he knew well that which experience had
long ago observed, <hi>Non tam juvare quae bene dicta sunt, quam noce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re

more apt from the errors and scapes of good men to draw apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
for their own, then to propose their good deeds for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
and patterns for themselves to follow. Neither is this
my own speculation: St. <hi>Austine</hi> observed it long since, who
discoursing upon the fall of <hi>David</hi> complaines, that from his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
many framed unto themselves this apology, <hi>Si David,

For greatness is able of it self, as it were, to legitimate foul

                     </gap>o, who used it, was to blame. When
St. <hi>Peter</hi> (<hi>Galath.</hi> 2.) had halted in his behaviour betwixt the
Gentiles and those of the Circumcision, St. <hi>Paul</hi> notes, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of the <hi>Jews,</hi> yea, <hi>Barnabas</hi> himself was carried away with
their dissimulation. And to speak truth, whom would not the
authority and credit of <hi>Peter</hi> have drawn into an error? So easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the faults of great men, <hi>adolescunt in exempla</hi> grow up and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
exemplary, and so full of hazzard is it, to leave unto the
world a memorial of the errors and scapes of worthy persons.
Yet Notwithstanding all this, the Holy Spirit of God, who
bringeth light out of darkness, and worketh above and against all
means, hath made the fall of his Saints an especial means to raise
his Church: and therefore hath is pleased him by the Pen-men
of the lives of his Saints in holy Scripture, to lay open in the view
of the world many grosse faults and imperfections, even of the
most excellent instruments of his glory. That which he tells.
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:114807:80"/>
the <hi>woman</hi> in the Gospel, who annointed him before his passion,
that wheresoever the Gospel should be preached, this fact of
hers should be recorded in memorial of her: the same, as it
seems was his intent concerning his Saints; that wheresoever
the word of life should be taught, there likewise should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
the grievous sins of his servants. And therefore accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
scarcely is there any one Saint in the whole book of God,
who is not recorded in one thing or other, to have notably over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shot
himself. Sometimes he hath made the Saints themselves
the proclaimers of their own shame. So he makes <hi>Moses</hi> to
register his own infidelity: so <hi>David</hi> in his one and fiftieth
Psalm, by the instinct of Gods spirit leaves unto the Church
under his own hand, an evidence against himself for his adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and murther. Sometimes he makes their dearest friends the
most exact chroniclers of their faults: for so St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves
of St. <hi>Mark,</hi> the companion and Scholer of <hi>Peter,</hi> who
hath more particularly registred the fall of his master, then any
of the other Evangelists, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> &amp;c. <hi>Who would not
marvel,</hi> saith he, that St. <hi>Mark not only concealed not the grosse es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
of his master, but hath more accurately then any of the rest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
the particulars</hi> of it, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>even because
he was his Disciple.</hi> As if he could have done his master no better
service, then to deliver a most exact relation of his fault. There
are yet two things further to be noted in this dispensation of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God. The first in regard of us, the second in regard
of the Saints, whose errors are recorded: for the first, who
can but marvel, that since all things that are written, are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
for our instruction, that if they be good, they may serve for
our imitation; if otherwise, for warnings to us: yet many sini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
actions of the Saints of God are so exprest in Scripture,
without censure, without note, that it were almost some dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
to pronounce of them? <hi>Abrahams</hi> equivocating with <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melech,
Jacobs</hi> deluding his blinde father, <hi>Rachel</hi> abusing <hi>Laban</hi>
with a lie, <hi>Jephthe</hi> his sacrificing his daughter, <hi>Sampson</hi> killing
himself with the <hi>Philistins;</hi> these and many other besides are so
fet down, that they may seem to have been done rather by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
instinct, then out of humane infirmity. Wherein the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:114807:81"/>
Ghost seems to me <hi>tanquam adoriri nos ex insidiis,</hi> to set upon
us out of ambush, to use a kind of guile, to see whether we have
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> spiritual discretion, to trie whether we
will attribute more to mens examples then to his precepts. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
in regard of the Saints themselves, it is worth our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
that God seems to have had more care to discredit them,
then to honour them, in that their faults are many times parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
registred, but their repentance is wrapt up in silence:
so the story of <hi>Noah</hi> is concluded with his drunkenness: after
the report of <hi>Lots</hi> incest, there is not a word of him throughout
the Scriptures: as soon as the story of <hi>Salomons</hi> idolatry is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
it immediately follows in the text: <hi>And Salomon died.</hi>
We should very much wrong these men, if we should think
that they past out of this life without repentance; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their repentance is concealed. Doubtless if we were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to search the mysteries of the spirit, we should finde that
the Holy Ghost hath left something for our instruction even in
this particular; for nothing in Scripture is done by chance.
But as St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> is wont sometime to tell his auditory, that
he will not resolve all doubts, but leave some to meditate on by
themselves: so will I now deal with you, I will leave this to
your private considerations, to practise your wits in the depths
of christianity, and so to frame reasons unto your selves of this
proceeding of the Holy spirit.</p>
                  <p>In the New Testament, the Holy Ghost constantly holds the
same course of relating the fall of the Saints: and so according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by all foure Evangelists sets down at large, the fearful sin of
<hi>Peter</hi> in denying and forswearing his Master. But as it pleased
him in mercy to give him repentance, so in these words which
I have read unto you, hath it pleased him to leave unto the
Church a memorial of it. Our first note therefore, before we
come to the words, shall be a note of that exceeding use and
profit which hath redounded to the Church by the registring of
<hi>Peters</hi> repentance; for this is done by the Holy Ghost, to signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
unto us the necessity and force of repentance, and sorrow for
sin. The concealing of <hi>Solomons</hi> reclaim hath occasioned some,
upon acknowledgement of the necessity of repentance, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:114807:81"/>
that <hi>Solomon</hi> past away without it, and so received the finall
reward of the impenitent. But he that should have read this
story of <hi>Peter,</hi> and observed what authority he had afterwards,
what especial favour our Saviour did him after his resurrection,
notwithstanding his fall, if the manner of his recovery had not
been recorded, might easily have entertained a conceit very
prejudicial to repentance, <hi>Quid non speremus?</hi> Who might not
hope to regain the favour of God without shedding a tear, if <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
notwithstanding so grievous a crime without repentance
should again be reconciled? We might therefore with excuse
have presumed upon a nonnecessity of repentance, as if it had been
enough in case of sin to practise that which common morality
teaches, barely to relinquish it without any more adoe, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
which we learn by this registring of <hi>Peters</hi> repentance is this,
that for the clearing of a Christian mans account unto God, it is
nor sufficient barely to cease from doing ill, to satisfie the law w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
we broke either with our life, or with our goods: to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
to our neighbour for wrong done him, all this and
much more washes not away the guilt of sin before God.
These are things which the very light of nature teaches us to do.
It was not to be thought that <hi>David</hi> to his former adulteries and
murther would have added new: he that hath been forc't to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
fourefold, that which he had taken away by stealth, will
peradventure take warning to steal no more. But this doth not
suffice him. There is a further duty, a duty of repentance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of every Christian man, a duty proper to him alone.
For this doctrine of repentance Nature never taught in her
school, neither was it ever found in the books of the learned.
It is particular to the Book of God, and to the doctrine that
came down from Heaven. In the sins against the first
Table we offend immediately, and only against God: but in
the sins against the second Table, there is a double guilt contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted,
one against God, another against our Neighbour: In
these sins, as there is a double fault, so there is a double sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction to be made, one unto God, another to our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:
for this second satisfaction between man and man, many
Heathen common-wealths have been very sufficiently furnished
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:114807:82"/>
with store of excellent laws. But of an attonement over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
to be made to God, they scarce seem to have had any
thought: and indeed to speak truth, to what purpose had it
been to trouble their heads about it; It is impossible that it
should ever fall within the conceit of any reasonable creature,
to pronounce what satisfaction was to be made for offence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
against God. He is of infinite majesty, holding no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion,
no correspondence with any created being. What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence
then can he receive from the hands of dust and ashes?
Ten thousand worlds, were we able to give them all, could not
make satisfaction for any part of the smallest offence we have
committed against him: when therefore the inventions of men
were thus at a stand, when all discourse, all reason were posed,
it pleased God in mercy to open his pleasure in his word, and
to accept of true and unfeigned repentance, as the only means
to wash away the guilt of sin against his majesty. A thing in
the eye of flesh and blood altogether ridiculous. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<hi>Julian,</hi> that accursed <hi>Apostata,</hi> scorning <hi>Constantine</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
for betaking himself to the Christian religion, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and derision of Baptisme and Repentance, thus speaks:
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> &amp;c. Hoe, whosoever is a corrupter and a defiler of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
whosoever is a man-slayer, whosoever is an impure and
unclean person, let him from henceforth <hi>be secure, and care for
nothing. I will shew him a little water,</hi> in which, <hi>if he do but dip
himself, he shall be forthwith clean:</hi> yea, <hi>though he desperately run
again into the same crimes. I will give him this gift, if he but knock
his breast and strike his forehead,</hi> (which are the gestures of the
penitent,) <hi>he shall without any more adoe become as pure as glass.</hi>
'Tis true indeed, in spight of unbelieving miscreants, it hath
pleased God through the foolishness of Baptisme and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
to save those that are his. The water of baptisme, and
the tears of true repentance, creatures of themselves weak and
contemptible; yet through the wonderful operation of the grace
of God annext unto them are able, were our sins as red as twice-died
scarlet, to make them as white as snow. The sentence of
God denounced unto <hi>Adam, What day thou eatest of the Tree thou
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:114807:82"/>
shall die,</hi> certainly was absolute and irrevocable neither could
any repentance of <hi>Adams</hi> totally have reverst it. Yet <hi>Abulensis</hi>
cries out, <hi>O quam foelix humanum genus, &amp;c.</hi> O how happy
should mankinde have been, if <hi>Adam</hi> after his fall had used the
benefit of Repentance, and in time acknowledged his sin unto
God. Yea, he goes further and seems to intimate, that it had
been of force almost to restore us unto our primitive purity.
For this way his words seem to look, when he saith, <hi>Quod si
seipsum accusasset nos omnes ab accusatione &amp; judicio liberasset; If he
had accused himself; doubtless he had freed us all from accusation and
curse.</hi> Whatsoever his meaning was, thus much without danger
we may think, that if our first Parents had not so strangly
shuffled their fault from the one to the other, the man to the
woman, the woman to the serpent, but had freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
it, and humbly begged pardon for it, God whose mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
were then as many and as ready as now they are, would, if
not altogether have revok't, yet doubtless much have qualified
and mitigated the sentence of the curse. If <hi>Adam</hi> had used
more ingenuity in confessing, God would have used less rigour
in punishing. Out of all this I draw this one lesson for your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.
Whosoever he be that thinks himself quit of some
sins into which either through weakness or carelessnes he hath
fallen, let him not presently flatter himself as if for this his book
of debt unto God were cancel'd, as if he were in state of
grace and new birth: but let him examine his own conscience,
and Impartially sist all the manner of his reclaim. He may
peradventure finde that upon some moral respect he hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off the practice of his sin: he may finde that he hath sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
his neighbour, contented the Law, done many acts, by
which he hath purchast reconciliation with the world. But if
he finde not this passage of Repentance and hearty sorrow twixt
God and his own soul, let him know that God is yet unsatisfied,
that he is yet in his sin: his sin is yet unrepented of and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
still remains.</p>
                  <p>THus from the necessity of registring <hi>Peters</hi> Repentance I
come to the words wherein it is registred, <hi>And he went
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:114807:83"/>
out, &amp;c.</hi> In these words we will consider four things, First the
person: He] <hi>He went forth;</hi> or, <hi>and going forth he wept.</hi> Secondly,
the preparative to the Repentance, <hi>He went forth.</hi> Thirdly, the
Repentance it self, comprised in the word <hi>wept.</hi> Fourthly, the
extent and measure, and compass of this Repentance, in the last
word, <hi>bitterly. I. He,</hi> The way of mans life is a slippery
way: no man whilst he is in it hath the priviledge of not sli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding,
just, and unjust, thus far, are of like condition: both fall.
But here they differ, the just man riseth again. Not the eminen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of <hi>Peters</hi> person, not his great understanding in the mystery
of Christ, not his resolution in our Saviours quarrel, not the
love and respect his Master bare him, kept him from falling.
But <hi>Peter</hi> being fallen provides himself to rise, and therefore
in the second place, <hi>he went forth,</hi> saith my Text, <hi>Peter</hi> was
now in the High-priests Court, a place very unfit for one in
<hi>Peters</hi> case. Princes Courts are no place for Repentance: To
wear soft raiment, to fair deliciously every day, this is Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
guise. But <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> the shirt of hair, the tear of Repentance; this is the habit of
the penitent. But wherefore went <hi>Peter</hi> out? Did he as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
observes of the Scribes and Pharisees, go out into the
wilderness to see? to gaze and look about him? No, His eyes
now must do him other service. He went out as <hi>Joseph</hi> did from
the face of his Brethren, to seek a place to weep. <hi>Maldonat</hi>
the Jesuite thinks it would have been a more goodly thing, and
far more beseeming <hi>Peters</hi> resolution, if in the place he had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
in the same he had repented: if before those he had
made a constant confession of Christ before whom he had deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him: But be the reasons what they will which moved <hi>Peter</hi>
to go forth, we will not prescribe unto the Saints a form of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
we will cease therefore to dispute what <hi>Peter</hi> should
have done, and rather gather lessons for our selves out of what
he did: fourthly, and last of all, as <hi>Peters</hi> fault was great, so
he contends that his Repentance may be as serious. The tears
therefore he sheds are not slight, and perfunctory shed only for
fashions sake, such as <hi>Quintilian</hi> spake of, <hi>nihil facilius lachrimis
marescit, Nothing sooner grows dry then tears:</hi> but as the Text saith,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:114807:83"/>
                     <hi>He wept bitterly:</hi> to summon up that <hi>Siccoculum genus Christiano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi>
a sort of Christians, who never had tear dropt from their
eye to witness their repentance: to teach us to enlarge the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of our sorrow for our sins, and in case of grievous relapse
not mince out our repentance, but to let loose the rains unto grief.
And thus I come to handle the parts in order more particularly:
and first of the person, <hi>He.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Amongst all the Saints of God whose errours are set
down in holy Scriptures, there is none whose person was more
eminent, or fall more dangerous then Saint <hi>Peters.</hi> That which
wisemen have observed in great and eminent wits, that they
evermore exceed, either they are exceeding good or else they
are exceeding bad, in Saint <hi>Peter</hi> was true both ways. His gifts
of Faith, of understanding in the mystery of Godlines, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
to die in our Saviours cause, were wonderful: but yet
his errours were as many and as strange, yea, so much the more
strange, because in that thing he most offended, in which he was
most eminent. It was a great argument of his Faith, when in
the Tempest meeting our Saviour on the waters, he calls out
unto him, <hi>if it be thou, command me to come unto thee on the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters;</hi>
but no sooner was he come out of the ship, but through
infidelity he began to sink. Again, of his great understanding
in the mystery of Christ he gave a notable instance, when being
questioned by our Saviour <hi>whom men took him to be,</hi> he gave the
first evident, plain, and open testimony that ever was given
him by man, <hi>Thou art Christ the Son of the living God. John</hi>
indeed gave testimony, and so did <hi>Simeon,</hi> and so did
many more: but it was more involv'd, done in more covert
terms, more dark: Whence we may and that not without
some probability argue, that the understanding of these men was
not so evidently, so fully, so perspicuously enlightned as was
<hi>Peters. Signum est intelligentis posse docere:</hi> It is a great argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
that a man doth passing well understand himself, when he is
able perspicuously and plainly to speak to the understanding of
another. This confession therefore of <hi>Peter,</hi> that carries with
it greater light and perspicuity then any yet that ever was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
doth not obscurely intimate that he had a greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:114807:84"/>
of illumination, then any of his predecessors. Yet to see
the wonderful dispensation of the holy Ghost, scarce was this
confession out of his mouth, but in the very next bout where
our Saviour begins further to enform him in the particulars of
his Passion, and Death, and despiteful handling by the <hi>Jews,</hi> the
edge of his conceit was quite turned, quite blunted and dull.
Poor man, as if he had been quite ignorant of the end of
Christs coming, out of a humane conceit and pity, he takes
upon him to counsel and advise our Saviour. Sir, <hi>favour your
self, these things shall not come unto you:</hi> and for this pains he is
rewarded with no less reproachful a name then that of <hi>Satan,</hi> of
a seducer, of a Devil. He that shall peruse the story of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
and here stay himself, might think that that which we
read <hi>John</hi> the sixth, <hi>v.</hi> 70. spoken of <hi>Judas, Have I not chosen you
twelve and one of you is a Divel:</hi> were here fulfilled in <hi>Peter,</hi> Last
of all his love to Christ, and resolution in his quarrel, he gave
an evident testimony, when he protested himself ready to lay
down his life for him. <hi>Greater love then this in the Apostles judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
no man hath then to lay down his life for his friend.</hi> This Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> had, if we may believe himself. Yea, he began to express
some acts of it, when in defence of his master he manfully drew
his sword, and wounded the servant of the high Priest. But
see how soon the scene is changed. This good Champion of
our Saviour, as a Lyon that is reported to be daunted with the
crowing of a Cock, is stricken out of countenance and quite
amazed with the voyce of a silly Damsel. Yea, so far is he
possest with a spirit of fear, that he not only denies, but abjures
his master, and perjures himself, committing a sin not far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
the sin of <hi>Judas;</hi> yea, treading it hard upon the heels. But
the mercy of God that leaves not the honour of his servant in
the dust of death, but is evermore careful to raise us up from
the death of sin, unto the life of righteousness; suffers not this
rock, this great pillar of his Church to be overthrown. He
first admonishes him by the crowing of a Cock: when that
would not serve, himself (full of careful love and goodness)
though in the midsts of his enemies, forgets his own danger, and
remembers the danger of his servant. Himself was now as a
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:114807:84"/>
sheep before the shearer, dumb and not opening his mouth: yet
forgets he not that he is that great shepherd of the flock, but
<hi>David</hi> like rescues one of his fould from the mouth of the Lion
and from the paw of the Bear. <hi>He turns about and looks upon
him,</hi> saith the Text, he cries louder unto him with his look,
then the cock could with his voice. Of all the members in the
body the <hi>eye</hi> is the most moveing part, that oft-times is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in a look, which by no force of speech could have been
uttered, this look of Christ did so warm <hi>Peter</hi> almost frozen
dead with fear that it made him well-near melt into tears. As
if he had cried out with the spouse, <hi>Cant.</hi> 6. <hi>O turn away thine
eyes, for they have overcome me,</hi> he grows impatient of his looks,
and seeks for a place to weep, what a look was this think you?
Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> discoursing with himself what might be the cause
that many of the Disciples, when they were called by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,
presently without further consultation arose and followed
him, thinks it not improbable, that there did appear some Glory
and Majesty in his Countenance, which made them believe he
was more than a Man that thus bespake them; whatsoever then
appear'd in his Looks, doubtless in this Look of his was seen
some Soveraign power of his Diety that could so speedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
a man thus almost desperately gone: a man that had one
foot in hell, whom one step more had irrecoverably cast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:
It was this Look of Christ that restored <hi>Peter. Quos
respicit Jesus plorant delictum,</hi> saith Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> those weep
for their sins whom Jesus looks upon. <hi>Negavit primo Petrus &amp;
non flevit, quia non respexerat Dominus. Negavit secundo: non fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit,
quia adhuc non respexerat Dominus. Negavit tertio, &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spexit
Jesus, &amp; ille amarissimè flevit. Peter</hi> denies him once, and
repents not, for Jesus look't not back upon him: he denies him
the second time, and yet he weeps not, for yet the Lord look't
not back. He denies him the third time, and Jesus looks upon
him, and then he weeps bitterly. Before I come to make use
of this, it shall not be altogether impertinent to say something
unto some queries that here arise concerning the condition of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and in him of all the Elect of God, whilst they are in state of
sin unrepented of for, as for <hi>Peters</hi> faith, which some makes
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:114807:85"/>
doubt of, there can as I conceive; no question be made. It is
not to be thought that <hi>Peter</hi> had rever'st with himself the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
that he had formerly made of Christ or that he thought
doubtless I have er'd, this is not the person whom I took him to
be. Indeed, through fear and cowardize he durst not confess that
with his mouth unto salvation which in his heart he believed unto
righteousnes. Any thing further then this, that speech of our
Saviour takes away, wherein he tells him before hand, <hi>I have
pray'd that thy faith might not fail.</hi> But since our Age hath had
experience of some, who because the Election of God stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
sure, and Christs sheep none can take out of his hands,
conclude therefore that for the Elect of God there is no falling
from Grace, that to <hi>David</hi> &amp; <hi>Peter</hi> no ill could happen, no though
(for so they have given it out) that they had died in the very
act of their sin: To meet with such disputants, I will briefly
lay down what I conceive is to be thought in the point.
Wherefore <hi>parate fauces pani,</hi> as Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> speaks. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
I have given you milk provide your stomacks now
for harder meat, and such as befits strong men in Christ. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
and <hi>Judas</hi> (for I will couple them both together in my dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
whilst they are both joyned together in sin) <hi>Peter,</hi>
I say, and <hi>Judas</hi> in regard of their own persons, were both, more
or less in the same case, both fallen from Grace, both in
state of sin and damnation, till the Repentance of <hi>Peter</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the case on his part. But the Grace of God signified
two things: either the purpose of Gods Election, the
Grace and Favour Inherent in the Person of God, which he
still casts upon those that are his notwithstanding their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold
backslidings: or else it signifies the habit of sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
qualities Inherent in the Regenerat Man, those good
Graces of God, by which he walks holy and unblamea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Again, the state of damnation signifies likewise two things:
either the purpose of Gods reprobation, or else the habit of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
qualities in the sinful man: from the state of Grace,
as it signifies the purpose of God to save, the Elect can never fall:
In the state of damnation, as it signifies something inherent in us,
every man by nature is, and the elect of God even after their
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:114807:85"/>
Calling many times fall into it: that is, they may and do many
times fall into those sins; yea, for a time continue in them, too
(<hi>David</hi> did so for a whole years space) which except they be
done a way by repentance, inevitably bring forth eternal death,
for the state of mortal sin unrepented of, is truly and indeed the
state of death; yea, the whole and sole reason of the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of every one that perishes; for Christ hath said it, <hi>except
ye repent, ye shall all perish.</hi> So then you see, that into the state
of damnation, as it signifieth something inherent in us, a man
may fall, and yet not fall from the state of grace, as it signifies
Gods purpose of election: for both these are compatible for a
time; if then we look upon the persons of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> both
of them are in the state of mortal sin unrepented of; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
both in state of damnation: but if we look back unto God,
we shall see a hand reacht out unto <hi>Peter,</hi> pulling him back as he
is now running down the hill, which hand we do not see reacht
out unto <hi>Judas.</hi> Christ had a look in store for <hi>Peter,</hi> which if
it had pleased him to have lent unto <hi>Judas, Judas</hi> would have
done that which <hi>Peter</hi> did. When then we pronounce <hi>Peter,</hi>
and in him any of the elect of God, as they are in <hi>Peters</hi> case to
be fallen from grace; we speak not with relation to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
of God; but we mean only that they have not that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of Sanctification, which ought to be in every childe, which
shall be an heir to life, and what hinders to pronounce that man
fallen from grace, whom we must needs acknowledge to be in
that state, in which if he continue, there is no way open but to
death? What then may some man say, had <hi>Peter</hi> lost the spirit
of adoption? Had he not those sanctifying qualities of faith,
hope, &amp; charity, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> are proper to the Saints, and are given them
by divine inspiration in the moment of their conversion: was
that immortal seed of the word quite kill'd? No verily; How
then? Having all these, may he yet be called the childe of
death? I answer, he may and is indeed so, for these do not
make him that at no time he can be so, but that finally he shall
not be so, for they are not armour of proof to keep out all darts,
neither do they make our souls invulnerable, as the Poets faine
the body of <hi>Cyenus</hi> or <hi>Achilles</hi> to have been: but they are preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:114807:86"/>
balms evermore ready at hand to cure the wound when it is
given. They are not of force to hinder mortal sin, (for then
every soul in whom they are were pure, undefiled, neither
were it possible, that the Elect of God after their conversion
should fall,) but they are of force to work repentance, which
makes all our wounds remediable. He that is mortally sick and
dies, and he that is likewise mortally sick, and through help of
restoring physick recovers, in this both agree, that they are
mortally sick, notwithstanding the recovery of one party. The
wound of <hi>Peter</hi> and of <hi>Judas</hi> was mortal, and in both festred
unto death; but there was balm in <hi>Gilead</hi> for <hi>Peter,</hi> for <hi>Judas</hi>
there was none. The sting of the <hi>fiery Scorpion</hi> in the wilderness
was deadly, and all that looked not on the brazen serpent died.
The brazen serpent altred not the quality of the Scorpions sting,
it only hindred the working of the poyson: the sting of sin in
<hi>Peter,</hi> and in <hi>Judas</hi> was deadly: but he that was lift up on
mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> as the brazen serpent was in the wilderness, at
him did <hi>Peter</hi> look and live: <hi>Judas</hi> did not look, and therefore
died. How comes it about beloved that God every where in
Scripture threatens death, without exception to all that repent
not, if the state of <hi>sin</hi> unrepented of, in whomsoever it is, be
not indeed the state of death. When <hi>David</hi> was intending to
stay in <hi>Keilah;</hi> and suspecting the inhabitants of that city, asks
of God <hi>whether the men of Keilah would deliver him over into the hand
of Saul:</hi> God tells him <hi>they would:</hi> and therefore certainly had
he stayed there, he had been betrayed unto <hi>Saul:</hi> to urge that
<hi>Peter,</hi> because of Gods purpose to save him, could not have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
miscarried, though he had died without repentance, (as
some have not stuck to give out) is nothing else in effect, but to
maintain against God, that <hi>David</hi> had he stayed in <hi>Keilah</hi> had
not fallen into <hi>Sauls</hi> hands, because we know it was Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
to preserve <hi>David</hi> from the violence of <hi>Saul.</hi> All the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations
of God are of equal certainty. It was no more
possible for <hi>Saul</hi> to seaze on <hi>David,</hi> then it is for the Devil to
pull one of Gods elect out of his hand; as therefore the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
purpose of God to free <hi>David</hi> from the malice of <hi>Saul,</hi>
took not away that supposition, <hi>If</hi> David <hi>go to</hi> Keilah, <hi>he shall
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:114807:86"/>
fall into the hands of</hi> Saul, so neither doth the decree of God to
save his elect destroy the supposition, <hi>if they repent not, they die
eternally,</hi> for the purposes of God, though impossible to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated,
yet lay not upon things any violent necessity, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt
not from the use of ordinary means: they infringe not our
liberty, they stand very well with common casualty: yea, these
things are the very means by which his decrees are brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout.
I may not stand longer upon this, I will draw but one
short admonition, and so an end: Let no man presume to look
into the Third Heaven, to open the books of life and death, to
pronounce over peremptorily of Gods purpose concerning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
or any other man. Let every man look into himself, and
trie whether he be in the faith or no; the surest means to trie
this, is to take an unpartial view of all our actions, many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
themselves whilst they argue from their faith to their
works, whereas they ought out of their works to conclude their
faith; whilest presuming they have faith, and the gifts of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
they think all their actions warrantable: whereas
we ought first throughly to sift all our actions, to examine them
at the Touch of Gods Commandements, and if indeed we finde
them currant, then to conclude that they come from Sanctifying
Graces of the Holy Spirit. It is faith indeed that gives the tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,
the die, the relish unto our actions, yet the only means
to examine our faith is by our works. It is the nature of the
Tree that gives the goodness, the favour and pleasantness to the
fruit, yet the fruit is the only means to us, to know whether the
tree be good. <hi>By their fruit ye shall know them,</hi> saith Christ: It is
not a rule not only to know others, but ourselves too. To rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
thus, I am of the elect, I therefore have saving faith, and
the rest of the sanctifying qualities, therefore that which I do is
good: thus I say to reason is very preposterous. We must go
a quite contrary course, and thus reason: my life is good, and
through the mercies of God in <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> shall stand with
Gods Justice: I therefore have the Gifts of Sanctification, and
therefore am of Gods Elect: for <hi>Peter</hi> to have said with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
I am of the Elect, this sin therefore cannot indanger me,
had been great presumption, but thus to have reasoned, my sin
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:114807:87"/>
is deadly, therefore except I repent, I am not of the number of
Gods Elect, this reasoning had well befitted <hi>Peter,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
every Christian man, whom common frailty drives into
the like distress.</p>
                  <p>I made my entrance into my Sermon with the consideration
of the wisdome of God, in permitting his chiefest servants to
fall dangerously: I have largely exemplified it in the person of
<hi>Peter:</hi> give me leave to make this further beneficial unto you by
drawing some uses from it; for great profit hath redounded to
the Church through the fall of these men; <hi>Felicius ille cecidit quam
ceteri steterunt,</hi> saith St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> of this fall of <hi>Peter.</hi> His sin
hath more avail'd us, then the righteousness of many others;
for wheresoever it pleases the Holy Spirit of God to work effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually,
(I speak cautelously, because I would give no place to
presumption) in him he makes excellent use oftimes, even of
sin and evil. First of all it is a tried Case, that many times
through negligence and carelesness, we suffer our selves to lie
open to many advantages. In such a case as this, a blow given
us, serves us for a remembrance to call our wits about us, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
to <hi>stir up the Grace of God that isin us,</hi> which many times is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlunio</hi>
lies covered like fire under ashes; for as a skilful wrestler
having suffered his adversary to take advantage upon some over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight,
recollects himself, and comes forward with greater
strength and wariness: <hi>et pudor incendit vires et conscia virtus:</hi>
shame of the foil and impatience of disgrace, addes strength un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him and kindles him: so oft times is it with the Saints of
God. The shame of having fallen makes them summon up
their forces, to look better about them, to fulfil their duty in
larger sort, then if they had not slipt at all. Hence it is, that
we see that of the bitterest enemies of the Church, have been
made the best converts; of this we have a notable example in
S. <hi>Paul;</hi> how eager was he in the quarrel of the <hi>Jews</hi> against <hi>Christ?</hi>
None a more mischievous enemy to the Christians then he; yet,
when it pleased God to shew him his error, he proved one of
the most excellent instruments of Christs glory, that ever was
on earth. And so accordingly he gives himself a most true te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony:
<hi>I have laboured more abundantly,</hi> not then one or two
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:114807:87"/>
of them, but, <hi>then they all:</hi> his writings being as much in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,
as of them all: and St. <hi>Lukes</hi> story being nothing else al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
but a register of the acts of <hi>St. Paul.</hi> The sense and consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
I doubt not, of that infinite wrong done to the Church
provoked him to measure back to the utmost of this power, his
pains and labour in making up the breach, he had formerly
made: here then is a notable lesson for us, teaching us to make
our former sins and impieties, admonitioners unto us to know
our own strength, &amp; by Christian care &amp; watchfulness to prevent
all advantages, which the Devil may take by our rechlesness and
negligence; for beloved, it is not so much our impotency and
weakness, as our sloth and carelesness, against which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
enemy doth prevail; for through the Grace of him that
doth-inable us, we are stronger then he: and the policie of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
warfare hath as many means to beat back and defend, as
the deepest reach of Satan hath to give the on-set. The <hi>Envious
man</hi> in the Gospel rusht not into the field in despite of the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman,
and the servants, but came and sowed his tares,
<hi>whilst men slept</hi> saith the text. Our neglect and carelesness is the
sleep that he takes advantage of; when <hi>David</hi> was so strangely
overtaken, the Scripture tells us he rose from <hi>his bed,</hi> to walk on
the top of his pallace, from his bed indeed he arose, but not from
his sleep; for mark I beseech you: <hi>David</hi> had spent much of his
time about the Court, he had been abroad, and seen and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sak'd
many cities, and doubtless he had seen many women as
fair as the wife of <hi>Vriah,</hi> and that in his younger days, when he
was more apt to kindle. Why then now commits he so great
an oversight? Look on him a while as now he is. He is now
at rest in his pallace, at ease on his bed, and to solace himself
he must rise and walk at the top of his house, and idely gaze up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a naked dame: of this his idleness the Devil takes advantage:
this is the sleep in which he comes and sows tares in <hi>Davids</hi> heart,
even al manner of lust. So that <hi>David</hi> fell as <hi>Adam</hi> did in Paradise,
not as a man that falls before an enemy stronger then himself.
The greatest part of the sins which we commit, are in this
rank with <hi>Davids</hi> sin: <hi>He is faithful,</hi> saith the Apostle, and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
no man to be tempted above his strength. Many creatures,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:114807:88"/>
if they knew their strength, would never suffer themselves to
be aw'd by man as they are. Beloved, we are become like horse
and mule without understanding, we know not our <hi>strength</hi> we
are more blinde then the servant of <hi>Elizaeus,</hi> and see not <hi>that they
that are with us are more, and more mighty then they that are against us.</hi>
The Angels are ministring spirits, sent out of purpose to gard
us, and doubtless do many and great services for us, though we
perceive not. We have the army of God, <hi>ubi mille clipei &amp;
omnis armatura fortium,</hi> where are a thousand bucklers and all
the weapons of the mighty, the helmet of Salvation, the sword of
the Spirit, the sheild of Faith to quench all the fiery darts of
sin: only let us not neglect to buckle it on, and make use of it.
We have to strive with an enemy, such a one as <hi>Anibal</hi> reported
<hi>Marcellus</hi> to be, <hi>Qui nec bonam nec malam ferre fortunam potest seu
vicit, ferociter instat victis; seu victus est, instaurat cum victoribus
certamen;</hi> a restless enemy that is never quiet, howsoever the
world goes, if he conquer us, he insolently insults upon us;
if we foil him; he still bethinks himself how to set upon us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh.
Let us not therefore suppose <hi>sedendo &amp; votis debellari
posse,</hi> that the conquest will be gotten by sitting still and wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all were well. We oft maintain against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
that our natural abilities whilest we live serve us not to fulfil the
Law of God. What bootes it thus to dispute? shall the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
of our unableness to do what we ought, excuse us at all
if we do not that which we are able? <hi>S. Austin</hi> was of opinion
how justly I will not dispute but of that opinion he was, and it
was the occasion of his book, <hi>de spiritu &amp; litera ad Marcellinum:</hi>
that it was possible for us even in this natural life seconded by
the grace of God, perfectly to accomplish what the Law re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
at our hands. Let the truth of this be as it may be: cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
that is most true which the same Father adds: that let our
strength be what it will, yet if we know not our duty we shall
do it no more then the traveller sound of body or limb, can go
that way aright of which he is utterly ignorant. Yea, let our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
be perfect, and let our knowledge be also absolute, yet if
we have no minde; if we want a love unto our duty, if we suffer
our selves to be overswayed by affection to other things, yet shall
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:114807:88"/>
we not do our duty. For which of us being at liberty will do
that which he hath no love unto? Beloved, as for or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
God hath left unto us Scripture, the perfect register of
all our duty the absolute itinerary and map of all the course
which in this life we are to run: &amp; as for <hi>love</hi> he plentifully sheds
it in the hearts of all those that by faithful prayer beg it of him.
If we shall search the Scripture to improve our knowledge, if
we shall earnestly beg at his hands to inflame our love. Let our
natural possibilities be what they will: he that now doth little
amongst us shall do much, and he that doth much shall do much
more: and the promises made unto the <hi>Jews</hi> concerning their
carnal enemies, shall be made good on us concerning our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
and ghostly enemies, <hi>one of us shall chase a thousand,</hi> and
<hi>if they come out against us on way, they shall fly before us seven
wayes.</hi> And thus much for the first use.</p>
                  <p>There is a second benefit of great weight and moment, which
we reap out of the consideration of the errours of these excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Ministers of God: namely a lesson teaching us to <hi>beware of
spiritual pride.</hi> Of all the vices which our nature is subject un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
this is the most dangerous, and of which we had need be most
cautelous. For whereas all other vices proceed from some ill
in us, from some sinful imbecillity of our nature, this alone
arises out of our good parts; Other sins draw their being from
that original corruption which we drew from our Parents, but
this may seem to be the mother of that; as by which even na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
unstained and in their primitive purity may most easily
fall. And therefore not without some probability is it concluded
in the Schools, That no other crime could throw the Angels down
from heaven but this. That which one leaves for a memorial to
great men, that in dangerous times, <hi>non minus periculum ex
magna fama quam ex mala,</hi> it was a matter of like danger to
have a good name as an ill, that may I pronounce of a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
man, the danger of his innocency is not much less then of
his faults. For this Devil when he cannot drive us to <hi>despair</hi> by
reason of our sin, takes another course to see if he can make us
<hi>presume</hi> upon conceit of our righteousness. For when by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
grace of God we keep our selves from greater offences
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:114807:89"/>
if we finde our selves to have a love unto the word of God, and
the true professours of it, to be rich in almsdeeds, to have a
part in other acts of righteousness, he makes us first take notice
of these good things in us, notice taken draws us to love and
admire them in us: self-love draws us on to compare our selves
with others, then to prefer our selves before others, and third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to disdain others in respect of our selves. Here now is a gap
laid open to a thousand inconveniences. And hence it is that
we see divers times men otherwise of life and reputation pure
and unblameable, upon conceit and unconsiderateness by a secret
judgement of God to fall upon extremes no less fearful then are
the issues of open prosaness and impiety. To cut of therefore
all way that may be opened to let in spiritual pride it hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
God to make use of this as of a soverain remedy namely to
permit even in his most chosen vessels, evermore secret and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
infirmities and sometimes gross and open scapes, which may
serve when they look into themselves to abate all overweening
conceit of their own righteousness, and when they shall look
into the errours of others, may be secret admonitioners unto
them, not rashly to condemn them, considering their own
weakness. I will therefore shut up this place with the saying of
Saint <hi>Ambrose, etiam laepsus sanctorum utilis est, Nihil mihi obsuit
quod negavit Petrus, etiam profuit quod emendavit.</hi> The fall of the
Saints is a very profitable thing. It hurts not me that <hi>Peter</hi>
denied Christ, and the example of his amendment is very
beneficial unto me. And so I come unto the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
unto <hi>Peters</hi> Repentance, in these words, <hi>and he went
forth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THe wisdom of God hath taught the Church sometime
by express message delivered by words of mouth, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
by dumb signes and actions. When <hi>Jeremy</hi> walk't up and
down the city with a yoke of wood about his neck, when <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel</hi>
lay upon his side, besieged a Slate with the draught of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi>
upon it, and like a banished man carried his stuff up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his shoulders from place to place: they did no less prophesie
the captivity, desolation, famine and wo, which was to fall
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:114807:89"/>
upon <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> then when they denounced it by direct word and
speech: yea, many of the ordinary actions of the <hi>Patriarks,</hi>
which seem to participate of chance, and to be in the same rank
with those of other men, themselves (as a learned divine of our
Mercerus age observes) not intending or understanding any such
thing, contained by the dispensation of the Holy Ghost, especial
lessons and instructions for us. That speech of <hi>Sarah, cast out the
bondwoman and her son,</hi> &amp;c. seemed to <hi>Abraham</hi> only a speech of
curst heart, and she her self perceives not her self to speak by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
from God, but moved with impatience of <hi>Ismaels</hi> petu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
behaviour toward her son. Yet the Holy Ghost himself
hath taught us, that this act of hir prefigured a great mystery.
Many disputations there are concerning the cause of this action
of <hi>Peters</hi> going forth: whether it were out of the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity
that is in most men, namely a greater shame to repent
then to offend: or whether it were out of modesty and good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that he could not indure the sight of Christ, whom he had
so grievously offended. Howsoever it were, we shall do this
Scripture no wrong, if we think it to contain an act in outward
shew casual, and like unto the actions of other men, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
indeed an especial action of a person great in the sight
of God; and therefore comprehending some especial instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And to speak plainly, this abandoning the place wherein
he fell, the company for fear of whom he fell, and those things
that were occasioners of his sin, doth not obscurely point out
unto us an especial duty of speedy relinquishing and leaving of
all, either friends or place, or means, or whatsoever else,
though dearer unto us then our right hand, then our right eye;
if once they become unto us inducements to Sin. In former
days before the <hi>Fulness of time came,</hi> the Calling of the Elect of
God was not by any one act more often prefigured, then by this
action of <hi>going forth.</hi> When the purpose of God was to select
unto himself a Church, and to begin it in <hi>Abraham, come forth,</hi>
faith he unto him, <hi>out of thy countrey, and from thy kindred, and
from thy fathers house.</hi> When <hi>Israel</hi> being in <hi>AEgypt,</hi> it pleased
God to appoint them a set Form and manner of serving him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
this could be done, they and all theirs must <hi>come forth of AE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:114807:90"/>
they must not leave a hoof behinde them.</hi> When the time of
the Gospel was come, our <hi>Saviour</hi> holds the same course: none
must be of his company, but such as come forth, <hi>leave all and
follow him.</hi> And therefore the Apostle putting the <hi>Hebrews</hi> in
minde of their duty, expresses it in this very tearm; <hi>Let us go
forth, therefore unto him,</hi> saith he without the camp, <hi>bearing his
reproach.</hi> And in the original language of the New Testament,
the Church hath her name from this thing, from being <hi>called
forth;</hi> so that without a going forth there is no Church, no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
no Service to God, the reason of all which is this:
we are all by nature in the High Priests court, as <hi>Peter</hi> was,
where we all deny and forswear our Master as <hi>Peter</hi> did: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is there any place for Repentance, till with <hi>Peter</hi> we go
forth and weep.</p>
                  <p>For our further light we are to distinguish the practise of this
our going forth, according to the diversity of the times of the
Church. In the first ages, when Christianity was like unto
Christ, and had no place to hide its head, no entertainment but
what persecution, and oppression, and fire, and sword could
yield it; there was then required at the hands of Christians, an
<hi>Actual going forth,</hi> a real leaving of riches, and friends, and lands,
and life for the profession of the Gospel. Afterward, when the
Tempests of persecutions were somewhat alay'd, and the skie
began to clear up, the necessity of actual relinquishing of all
things ceast, Christians might then securely hold life and lands,
and whatsoever was their own, yet that it might appear unto
the world, that the resolution of Christian men was the same
as in times of distress and want, so likewise in time of peace and
security, it pleased God to raise up many excellent men, as well
of the Laity, as of the Clergy, who without constraint, volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
and of themselves, made liberal distribution of all they
had; left their means and their friends, and betook themselves
to deserts and solitary places, wholy giving themselves over to
meditation, to prayer, to fasting, to all severity and rigidness
of life, what opinion our times hath of these, I cannot easily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce:
thus much I know safely may be said, that when this
custome was in its primitive purity, there was no one thing
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:114807:90"/>
more behoofful to the Church. It was the Seminary and nursery
of the Fathers, and of all the famous Ornaments of the Church.
Those two things which afterwards in the decay and ruine of
this discipline, the Church sought to establish by <hi>Decrees</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions,</hi>
namely to estrange her Priests from the world and
bind them to single life, were the necessary effects of this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of living, for when from their childhood they had utterly se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questred
themselves from the world and long practised the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of it: when by chastising their body and keeping it under
with long fasting they had killed the heat of youth, it was not
ambition nor desire of wealth, nor beauty of women that could
withdraw them or sway their affections.</p>
                  <p>That which afterwards was crept into the Church and bare
the name of Monkery, had indeed nothing of it but the name, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
pretence of poverty they seized into their possession the
wealth and riches of the world, they removed themselves from
barren soils into the fattest places of the land, from solitary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarts
into the most frequented cities: they turned their poor cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
into stately pallace, their true fasting into formalizing and
partial abstinence. So that instead of going forth they took the
next course to come into the world: they left not the world for
Christ, but under pretence of Christ they gain'd the world:

<hi>Jerome</hi> by name, long ago complain'd of it. <hi>Nonnulli sunt diti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ores
Monachi, quam fuerant seculares, &amp; clerici qui possideant opes

ut suspiret eos ecclesia divites: quos tenuit mundos ante men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicos.</hi>
But I forbear and come to commend unto you another
kinde of going forth, necessary for all persons, and for all times.
There is a going forth in <hi>act</hi> and <hi>execution,</hi> requisite only at some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
and upon some occasions: there is a going forth <hi>in will</hi> and
<hi>affection:</hi> this let the persons be of what calling soever, and let
the times be never so favourable, God requires at the hands of
every one of us. We usually indeed distinguish the times of the
Church into times of peace, and times of persecution: the truth
is, to a true Christian man the times are always the same. <hi>Habet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etiam
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:114807:91"/>
pax suos martyres,</hi> saith one: there is a martyrdome even in
time of peace; for the practise of a Christian man in the calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
times, in readiness and resolution must nothing differ from
times of rage and fire. <hi>Josephus</hi> writing of the Military exercises
practised amongst the Romans, reports that for seriousness they
diffred from a true battel only in this, <hi>the battel was a bloody exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise,
their exercise a bloodless battel.</hi> Like unto this must be the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
exercise in times of peace, neither must there be any differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
betwixt those days of persecution, and these of ours, but only
this, <hi>those yeelded Martyrs with blood, ours without.</hi> Let therefore eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man throughly examine his own heart, whether upon supposal
of times of tryal and persecution, he can say with <hi>David, My heart
is ready,</hi> whether he can say of his dearest pledges, <hi>all these have I
counted dung for Christs sake,</hi> whether he finde in himself that he
can, if need be, even lay down his life for his profession. He that
cannot do thus, what differs his faith from a temporary faith, or
from hypocrisie? Mark, I beseech you what I say, I will not
affirm, I will only leave it to your Christian discretion. A tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
faith, that is, a faith resembled to the seed in the Gospel,
which being sown on the stony ground, withered as soon as the
sun arose, a faith that fails as soon as it feels the heat of persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
can save no man. May we not with some reason think that
the faith of many a one, who in time of peace seems to us, yea,
and to himself too peradventure to dy possest of it, is yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
no better then a temporary faith, and therefore comes
not so far as to save him that hath it? <hi>Rufus</hi> a certain Philosopher
whensoever any Scholars were brought unto him to receive edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
under him, was wont to use all possible force of argument
to diswade them from it: if nothing could prevail with them but
needs they will be his hearers, this their pertinacy he took for a
sure token of a mind throughly setled, &amp; led as it were by instinct
to their studies. If God should use this method to try who are
his, and bring on us those Temptations, which would make the
man of temporary faith to shrink: think we that all those who in
these times of peace have born the name of Christ unto their
graves, would have born unto the rack, unto the sword, unto the
fire? Indeed to man who knows not the thoughts of his friend
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:114807:91"/>
some trials sometimes are very necessary. But he that knew and
foretold <hi>David</hi> what the resolution of the men of <hi>Keilah</hi> would
be, if <hi>Saul</hi> came to them, knows likewise what the resolution of
every one of us would be if a fiery trial should appear. Who
knows therefore whether God hath numbred out the Crowns of
life, according to the number of their souls, who he foreknew
would in the midst of all Temptations and trialls continue unto
the end? for what difference is there betwixt the faith that fails
upon occasion, or that would fail if occasion were offred? for the
actual failing of faith is not that that makes it temporary, it is on<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> detects it, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> bewrays it unto us to be so. The faith
therefore of that man which would have <hi>sunk as fast as Peter did,</hi>
if tempests had arisen, notwithstanding that through the peace of
the Church he dies possest of, is no better then a temporary, and
cometh short of a saving faith. <hi>Durus sermo,</hi> it as a hard speech
some man may say: but let him that thinks thus, recount with
himself that <hi>Dura via,</hi> it is is a hard way that leads to life. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved,
deceive not your selves: heaven never was, nor will be
gotten without Martyrdom: In a word my Brethren try there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
your selves, whether you have in you true resolution, sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
up your thoughts, surveigh every path in which your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
are wont to tread: see whether you are prepared to leave all
for Christ. If you find in your selves but one affection looking
back to <hi>Sodom,</hi> to the things of this life, remember <hi>Lots</hi> wife, her
case is yours, you are not yet sufficiently provided for the day of
battel.</p>

that passed among some of the Heathen, that <hi>Vulcan</hi> offended
with the men of <hi>Athens,</hi> told them that they should be but fools:
but <hi>Pallas</hi> that favour'd them, told them they should be fools in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
but folly should never hurt them. Beloved our case is
like to that of the men of <hi>Athens, Vulcan</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> hath made us
fools, and weak, and so we are indeed of our selves: but the
Son of God, the true <hi>Pallas,</hi> the wisdome of the Father hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us this gift, that our weakness, shall never hurt us. For
look what strength we lost in <hi>Adam,</hi> that with infinite advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
is suppli'd in Christ. It was the Parable of <hi>Iphicrates,</hi> that
an <hi>Army</hi> of <hi>Harts,</hi> with a <hi>Lyon</hi> to their Captain, would be able
to vanquish an armie of Lyons, if their captain were but an
Hart. Beloved, were mankinde indeed but an army of Harts,
were we <hi>Hinnuleo similes,</hi> like unto the fearful <hi>Hinde,</hi> upon the
Mountains, that starts at every leaf that shakes: yet through
Christ, that strengtheneth us, having the Lyon of the tribe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
for our Captain, and Leader, we shall be able to vanquish
all that force; which the Lyon that goeth up and down seeking
<hi>whom he may devoure,</hi> is able to bring against us. Indeed we do
many times sadly bemoan our case, and much rue the loss, which
through the rechlesness of our first parents hath befallen us; Yet
let us chear up our selves, our fear is greater then our hurt: as
<hi>Elkanah</hi> speaks unto <hi>Hannah</hi> in the first of <hi>Samuel. Why weepest
thou? Am not I better unto thee then ten Sons.</hi> So will we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
our selves in the like manner. Let us sorrow no more for
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:114807:93"/>
our loss in <hi>Adam.</hi> For is not <hi>Christten fold</hi> better unto us, then
all the good of <hi>Paradise. The Mulbery tree indeed is broken down,
but it is built up again with Cedar.</hi> The loss of that portion of
strength, wherewith our Nature was originally endued, is
made up with fulness of power in Christ; It is past that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
of <hi>Zeba</hi> and <hi>Zalmana</hi> unto <hi>Gideon,</hi> in the Book of <hi>Judges,
As the man is, so is his strength;</hi> for now Beloved, <hi>as is God so is
our strength.</hi> Wherefore as St. <hi>Ambrose</hi> spake of <hi>Peters</hi> fall:
<hi>Non mihi obsuit quod negavit Petrus, immo prosuit, quod emenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit:</hi>
So may we speak of the fall of our first Parents, it hurts
not us that <hi>Adam</hi> fell; nay our strength and glory is much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,
that by Christ we are redeemed. Our natural weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
be it never so great, with this supply from Christ, is far a
above all strength, of which our Nature in its greast perfection
was capable. If we survey the particulars of that weakness,
which we drew from the loines of our first parents, we shall
finde the chiefest part of it to be in the loss of immortality. For
as for the loss of that pleasant place, the blindness of understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and perverseness of will, being suppos'd to betide us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
upon the fall, these seem weaknesses far inferior to our
mortality. For, God forbidding us the fruit of the tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
&amp; setting down the penalty that should ensue, making choice
(as it is most likely) of the fearfullest judgement, and what he
saw in his wisdome, was most likely to awe us, threatens nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
blindness of understanding, nor crookedness of Nature, but
tells us, <hi>What day ye eat of it, ye shall die.</hi> Yet see beloved, with
how great strength this mortal weakness is repair'd; For thus to
be able to encounter with death, the fearfullest of all Gods cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
and through Christ to overcome it, as all true Christians
do, to turn the greatest curse into the greatest blessing, is more
then <hi>immortality.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Si non errasset, fecerat ille minus.</hi> Had not man been thus
weak, he had never been thus strong. Again, on the contrary,
let us conceive unto the utmost, what our strength might be in
our first estate, let us raise our conceit unto the highest note we
can reach, yet shall we never finde it to be greater, then what
here is exprest in my Text. For greater ability, then power to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:114807:93"/>
do all things, is not imaginable, <hi>I can do all things.</hi> Beloved,
these words are <hi>Anakims,</hi> they beseem not the mouth of a man
of ordinary strength. He that hath right unto them, must be
one of the race of the Giants at least, for he saith not simply,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> I can, though peradventure with some difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
hardly with much labour, and pains, but he saith <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
; I can with ease, I have valour and strength to do them.
I ask then first as the <hi>Eunuch</hi> doth in the <hi>Acts:</hi> of whom speaks
our Apostle this, of himself or of some other man? I answer
both of himself, and all other Christians; For every Christian
man by reading it as he ought, makes it his own, for in reading
it as he ought, he reads it with the same spirit, with which
St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote it. Wherefore as St. <hi>Paul</hi> some where records
of himself, that he was not found inferiour to the chief <hi>Apostles,</hi>
so is it true that the meanest Christian that hears me this day,
in all that is contained in my Text, is parallel'd, is nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
unto St. <hi>Paul,</hi> unto the chief Apostles. What a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
then is this unto the <hi>brother of low degree,</hi> when he considers
with himself, that how mean soever he may seem to be, either
in the Church or common weal, yet notwithstanding in so great
a priviledge, as is this omnipotent power of doing all things;
he is equal unto <hi>Peter,</hi> unto <hi>Paul,</hi> the greatest <hi>Peers of the Church.</hi>
If then the weakness of Christians be so strong, as to deserve the
name of <hi>Almightiness,</hi> what name, what title doth the strength
of a Christian deserve to bear?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ask what meaning hath this word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, this <hi>can
do in my Text?</hi> I answer very large: first, though it be rendred
by this word doing, yet it comprehends sufferings too, for <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum:
valeo, I can,</hi> is as well to suffer as to do, and that our bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
Apostle amongst other things so meant it, is apparant by the
words foregoing my text. And here is the first part of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
omnipotency: his patience is infinite, it <hi>suffers all things.</hi>
Never any contumely, never any loss, never any smart so great,
as could weary out Christian patience. <hi>Talia</hi> (saith <hi>Tertullian,)
tantaque documenta, quorum magnitudo penes nationes detractatio fides
est, peaes nos vero, ratio, &amp; structio.</hi> Such examples, such pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
have we of Christian patience, as that with infidels they
seem incredible, and call in question the truth of our profession;
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:114807:94"/>
but with us they are the ground and foundation of faith. God
himself did never yet trie the utmost of a Christians patience:
neither hath he created any object, that is able to equal it, yet
he seems for our instruction to have gone about to trie, what
might have been done: he commanded <hi>Abraham</hi> to sacrifice his
dear and only son. <hi>Tam grave praeceptum, quod <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ec Deo perfici
placebat, patienter et audivit, &amp; si deus voluisset, implesset,</hi> saith
<hi>Tertullian.</hi> So heavy was the command, that God himself lik'd
not it should be acted, yet <hi>Abraham</hi> heard it patiently, and had
fulfilled it, if God would have given him leave. What should
I speak of poverty, of disease, of the sword, of fire, of death
it self, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> saith <hi>Gorduis</hi> the Martyr in St. <hi>Basil,</hi>

                     </gap>. O at what a loss
I am, saith he, that I can die but once for my Saviour. Take
the greatest instance of Gods sury and wrath, even the pains
laid up in Hell for the sinner, and we shall finde that there have
been Christians, who for the glory of God, would gladly have
endured them. St. <hi>Paul</hi> is the man amongst all the Saints of
God, the greatest and worthiest example of this wonderful
strength, of this omnipotency of a Christian man. What evil
is imaginable, which he did not either indeed, or at least in
will, and affection undergo? <hi>Omnem patientiae speciem adversus
omnem diaboli vim expunxit, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </hi> I am on fire saith Saint
<hi>Chrysostome,</hi> when I speak of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> and indeed whom would
it not inflame, to read that admirable <hi>Synopsis</hi> and brief of his
sufferings registred in the second of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> at the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth
Chapter. <hi>In labours more abundant, in stripes above measure,

he could; <hi>Sed ubi historiam praestare non po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

he reports historically what was done, and as if that were
not enough, he tells us what he would have done, and that his
patience was able even gladly to have encountred Hell it self,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> saith he in the ninth of the <hi>Romans,</hi> I have prayed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God, I have beg'd it at his hands, as a favour, that for the
increase of his glory through the Salvation of <hi>Israel</hi> my Kinsmen,
according to the flesh, I might become a cast-away, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
the pains of eternal fire. <hi>Tertullian</hi> considering the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:114807:94"/>
patience of our Saviour upon his cross; thinks that if
there had bin no other argument to prove him to be God, yet this
alone had been sufficient. <hi>Hanc vel maximè, Pharisaei Dominum
agnoscere debuistis: patientiam hujusmodi nemo hominum perpetraret.</hi>
In like manner may we truly say were there no other argument
to prove that Christ doth dwell in us, doth mightily streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
and inable us, yet this wonderful measure of patience in
so finite a creature, could never subsist, if God were not in us of
a truth.</p>
                  <p>Again <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, this word of doing here in my text, signifies not
only sufferings, and patience, this were to make a Christian but a
kinde of Stone: A Christian hath not only a Buckler to resist,
but he must have a sword to strike. Wherefore this word of
doing, must signifie yet further, some action and life; And so
indeed it doth; For it notes unto us the most glorious and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
kinde of Christian action, <hi>Victory</hi> and <hi>Conquest;</hi> and when
my Apostle here saith, <hi>I can do all things,</hi> his meaning is, <hi>I can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
and conquer all things.</hi> And here is the second and most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
part of <hi>Christian Omnipotency;</hi> Never was any true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
overcome or can he; <hi>For look how much he yields unto his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
so much he fails of his profession and title. David</hi> complains of
<hi>Joab</hi> and his <hi>Brethren; These sons of Zeruiah are too strong for me.</hi>
But, Beloved, a Christian man <hi>findes none of these sons of Zeruiah,</hi>
whom he needs to fear, or of <hi>whom he needs to complain.</hi> For as
<hi>Aristole</hi> tells us that a magnanimous man is he, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
who thinks nothing great, but conceits all things as inferior to
himself: so may we define a true Christian to be such a one as to
whom nothing is dreadful, in whose eye nothing under God
carries any shew of Greatness, S. <hi>Paul</hi> hath left us a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue
in the end of the eight to the Romans, of all the forces, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and inward, bodily and ghostly, that can be mustred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

things to come, heighth, depth, any creature imaginable and

is too mean a word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> we are more then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> saith Saint <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> we conquer them with ease, without any pains
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:114807:95"/>
or sweat? <hi>Paucas victoria dextras—exigit,</hi> we shall not need to
bring forth against them all our forces: a small part of them
will be sufficient to gain the day; and not only overcome them,
but turn them to our benefit and behoof. For sin is like unto
<hi>Sampsons</hi> Lyon: it comes upon us with open mouth to devour
us; but when we have slain it, we shall finde <hi>hony</hi> in the belly
of it, wonderful therefore is the power of a Christian, who
not onely overcomes and Conquers, and kills the viper,
but like the skilful <hi>Apothecary</hi> makes Antidote, and Tria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
of him. Indeed our Adversaries seem to be very
great. S. <hi>Paul</hi> calls them by wonderful names, as if he meant
to affright us: <hi>powers, principalities, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                     </hi> depths, the <hi>Prince
that ruleth in the Air, the God of this world,</hi> and what not? Yet
notwithstanding as one speaks in Livie of the <hi>Macedonian</hi> war,
as I remember: <hi>non quàm magni nominis bellum est, tam difficilem
existimaveritis victoriam;</hi> we must not think there will be any
doubt of the Victory, because it is a war of great name, and
noise; For me thinks, I discover in our Apostle, when he uses
these strange astonishing words, a spiritual stratagem: by
which to stir us up, and make us stand upon our guard, he
makes the largest report of our enemies forces. We read that
one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Captains, perceiving his Souldiers unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
to faint draws out letters before them, and reads the news
of that <hi>which never was,</hi> of, I know not what Kings with Armies
and multitude coming forthwith against them, which art of his
did much avail him to gain the victory; because it made the
Souldiers to recollect themselves, and fight withal their might.
Beloved, I may not think, that the Apostle in making this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of our enemies forces, relates that which is not, but this, I
think, I may safely say that he makes the most of that which is;
For it can never hurt us to take our enemie, to be as strong as he
is; or peradventure stronger, for this is a very profitable error,
it makes us more wary, and provide our selves the better. But to
flight, and contemn our enemy, to erre on the contrary side, and
think him to be weaker then he is, this hath caused many an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.
It is a rule which <hi>Vigetius</hi> gives us: <hi>Difficilimè vincitur,
qui verè potest de suis, &amp; de adversarii copiis judicare.</hi> It is an hard
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:114807:95"/>
matter to overcome him that truly knoweth his own strength, and
the strength of his adversary. And here, beloved, is the error
of most Christians; we do not know of what strength we are.
We look upon this body of ours, and suppose that in so weak
and faint a subject there cannot subsist so great strength, as we
speak of; as if a man should prize the liquor by the baseness of
the vessel in which it is. As divers <hi>Landlords</hi> have treasures hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
in their fields, which they know not of, so many of us have this
treasure of omnipotency in us, but we care not to discover it, &amp; to
know it, did we but perfectly know our own strength and would
we but compare it with the strength of our enemies: we should
plainly discover, that we have such infinite advantage above
them, that our conquest may seem not to be so great, as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
For the greater the advantages are, the glory of the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
is the less: and that which makes a conquest great, is not so
much the greatness of him that Conquers, as the strength and
greatness of him that is overthrown, Now what proportion is
there betwixt the strength of God himself dwelling in us, and
all the strength of Heaven, Earth, and Hell besides, how then
can we count this spiritual war so fearful, which is waged
upon so unequal termes. <hi>In quo si modo congressus cum hoste sis,
viceris,</hi>
in which if we but give the onset, we are sure to gain the
victory? <hi>restitisse vicisse est;</hi> To resist is to conquer for so saith
the Apostle, <hi>Resist the Devil and he shall flie from you.</hi> There was
never yet any Christian conquer'd, that could not: and in this
war not to yield the victory, is to get it. As therefore one spake
of <hi>Alexanders</hi> expedition into <hi>India: Benè ausus est vana contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere:</hi>
the matter was not much, which he did, the greatest
thing in it was, that he durst do it: so considering our strength,
and the weakness of our adversaries, we may without preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
speak even of the worthiest Souldiers, that ever fought
these Spiritual Battels, <hi>Benè aust sunt vana contemnere.</hi> The
greatest thing that we can admire in them is, that they durst do
it. Would we but a little examine the forces of our adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
we should quickly finde it to be as I have said; When
<hi>Alcibiades</hi> a young Gentleman of <hi>Athens</hi> was afraid to speak be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the multitude, <hi>Socrates</hi> to put him in heart, asks him; Fear
you saith he, <hi>such a one?</hi> and names one of the <hi>multitude to him;</hi>
                     <pb n="130" facs="tcp:114807:96"/>
No saith <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> he is but a <hi>Tradesman;</hi> Fear you such a one,
saith he, and <hi>names a second;</hi> No for he is but a <hi>Pesant:</hi> or such a
one, and <hi>names a third?</hi> No, for he is but an ordinary <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man?</hi>
Now saith he, of such as these doth the whole multitude
consist: and by this device, he encouraged <hi>Alcibiades</hi> to speak: He
that shall fear to encounter the multitude, and army of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
adversaries which are ready to set themselves against him:
Let him do by himself as <hi>Socrates</hi> did by <hi>Alcibiades.</hi> Let him sit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>down
and consider with himself his enemies one by one, and he
shall quickly discover their weakness, <hi>Primi in praeliis vincantur
oculi.</hi> Its a saying that the first thing that is overcome in a Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
is his <hi>eye,</hi> while he judges of his enemy, by his multitude,
and provision, rather then by his strength. Beloved, if we
judge not of our adversary in gross, and as it were by the eye:
we shall easily see, that we shall not need to do as the <hi>King in the
Gospel doth,</hi> send to his enemy with conditions of peace; For
there is no treaty of Peace to be had with these, <hi>Had Zimri peace
that slew his Master,</hi> saith the Scripture: <hi>And there is no peace unto
the wicked saith my God.</hi> Not only <hi>Zimri</hi> and the wicked but no
Christian hath or can have peace, he must be always as fighting
and alwayes conquering: Let us single out some one of this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
and let us examine his strength, Is it <hi>sin</hi> doth so much affright
us? I make choice of it, because it is the dreadfullest enemy that a
Christian hath: Let us a little consider its strength and we shall
quickly see, there is no such need to fear it. Sins are of two sorts,
either great and capital, or small and ordinary sins. I know it
were a paradox in nature to tell you that the greatest and the
mightiest things are of least force. Yet this is true in the case
we speak of: the greatest things are the weakest. Your own
experience tells you that rapes, and murthers, parricide, poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning,
treason and the rest of that rabble of arch sins, are the
sins of the fewest, and that they have no strength at all but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the weakest men. For doubtless if they were the strongest,
they would reign with greatest latitude, they would be the
commonest, they would be the sins of the most: But wandring
thoughts, idle words, petty lusts, inconsiderate wrath, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
love to the things of the world, and the rest of that
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:114807:96"/>
swarm of ordinary sins, these are they that have largest extent
and Dominion, and some of these, or all of these, more or
less prevail with every man. As the Magicians in <hi>Exodus,</hi> when
they saw not the power of God in the Serpents, in the blood in the
frogs; at the coming of the plague of the Lice presently cryed
<hi>Digitus Dei his est;</hi> this is the finger of God: so I know not
how it comes to pass, though we see and confess that in those
great and hainous crimes, the Devil hath least power, yet at
the comming of Lice, of the rout of smaller and ordinary sins,
we presently yield our selves captives and cry out <hi>Digitus Diaboli</hi>
the strength of the Devil is in these, as if we were like unto
that fabulous <hi>rack</hi> in <hi>Plinie,</hi> which if a man thrust at with his
whole body, he could not move it, yet a man might shake it,
with one of his fingers. Now what an error is it in us Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
when we see the principal and captain sins so easily van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisht,
to think the common Souldier or lesser sort invincible?
For certainly if the greatest sins, be the weakest, the lesser
cannot be very strong; Secondly is it <hi>Original corruption</hi> that
doth so much affright us. Let us consider this a little, and see
what great cause we have to fear it. And first beloved let us take
heed that we seem not <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> to fight with our own fansie,
and not so much to finde, as to fain an enemy: Mistake me not, I
beseech you, I speak not this as doubting that we drew any natural
infection from the loins of our Parents: but granting this, I take
it to be impossible to judge of what strength it is, and deny that
it is any such cause why we should take it to be so strong, as that
we should stand in fear to encounter it, and overcome it: For
we can never come to discover, how far our nature is necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
weak. For whilest we are in our infancy, and as yet not altred
a <hi>puris naturalibus</hi> from that which God and nature made us,
none of us understand our selves: and ere we can come to be of
years to be able to discover it, or define any thing concerning the
nature of it, custom, or education either good, hath much
abated, or evil, hath much improved the force of it; so that
for any thing we know the strength of it may be much less then
we suppose, and that it is but a fear that makes it seem so great,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:114807:97"/>
saith <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> It is the nature of timerous and fearful men
evermore to be framing to themselves causless fears, I confess, it
is a strange thing, and it hath many times much amazed me, to
see how ripe to sin many children are, in their young and tender
years: and ere they understand what the name of Sin and evil
means, they are unexpectedly and no man knows by what
means, wonderfully prompt and witty to villany, and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness;
as if they had <hi>gone to school to it in their mothers womb.</hi>
I know not to what cause to impute this thing, but I verily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
I might quit original sin from the guilt of it: For it is a
ruled case, and concluded by the general consent of the Schools,
that original sin is alike in all: and S. <hi>Paul</hi> seems to me to
speak to that purpose, when he saith, that God hath alike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
all under sin, and <hi>that all are alike deprived of the glory
of God.</hi> Were therefore Original sin the cause of this strange ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitancy
in some young children, they should all be so: a
thing which our own experience teaches us to be false: For we
see many times even in young children <hi>many good and gracious
things,</hi> which being followed with good education, must
needs come to excellent effect, <hi>In pueris elucet spes plurimorum,</hi>
saith <hi>Quintilian, quae ubi emoritur aetate, manifestum est, non defecisse
naturam sed curam:</hi> In children many times an hope of excellent
things appears, which in riper age for want of cherishing, fades
and withers away: A certain sign that nature is not so weak as
Parents and Tutors are negligent: whence then comes this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference?
Certainly not from our Nature, which is one in all:
but from some other cause. As for Original sin, of what strength
it is I will not discuss: only thus much I will say there is none of
us all, but is much more wicked, then the strength of any Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
corruption can constrain. Again, let us take heed that
we abuse not our selves, that we use not the names of original
weakness, as a stale, or stalking-horse as a pretence to choak, and
cover somewhat else: For oftentimes when evil education, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
examples, long custome, and continuance in sin hath bred in
us an habit, and necessity of sinning, presently Original sin,
and the weaknes of mans nature bear the blame: <hi>Ubi per se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordiam,
vires, tempus, ingenium, defluxere, nature infirmitas accusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:114807:97"/>
When through floath and idleness, luxurie and distemper,
our time is lost, our bodies decay'd, our wits dull'd, we cast all
the fault on the weakness of our nature; That <hi>Law of sin in our
members,</hi> of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> spake, and which some take to be origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
corruption; S. <hi>Austine</hi> once pronounced of it (whether he
meant to stand to it, I know not, but so he once pronounced of
it) <hi>Lex peccati est violentia consuetudinis; That Law of sin,</hi> that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
us against our wills, to sin, is nothing else, but the force
and violence of long custome and continuance in sin: I know,
that by the error of our first Parents the Devil hath blinded, and
bound us more then ever the Philistines did <hi>Samson.</hi> Yet this
needs not to make us thus stand in fear of Original weakness:
For blinde and bound as we are, let the Devil build never so
strong, yet if our hair be grown, if Christ do strengthen us,
we shall be able <hi>Samson-like</hi> to bear his strongest pillars, and pull
down his house about his ears.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, is it the <hi>Devil</hi> that we think so strong an adversary?
Let us a little consider his strength; he may be considered either
as an inward enemy, suggesting unto us sinful thoughts: or as an
outward enemy, lying in wait to afflict us in body, in goods, or
the like. First, against us inwardly, he hath no force of his own;
From our selves it is, that he borrows this strength to overthrow
us. In Paradice, he borrowed the Serpent to abuse us, but now
every Man is that Serpent, by which himself is abused. For as
<hi>Hannibal</hi> having overthrown the Romans took their armour and
fought against them with their own weapons. So the Devil
arms himself against us with our own strength, our senses, our
will, our appetite: with these weapons, he fights against us,
and uses us against our selves; Let us but recover our own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
and the Devil will be disarm'd: Think you that the Devil
is an immediate stickler in every sin that is committed? I know
ye do. But take heed, least this be but an excuse to unload your
faults upon the Devil, and to build them upon his back. For
S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> thought otherwise, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.
The Devils hand says he, is not in every fault,
many are done meerly by our own carelessness <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:114807:98"/>

                     </gap>. A negligent carelesse per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
sins, though the Devill never tempt him.
Let the truth of this lie where it will, I think I may safely speak
thus much, that if we would but shut up our wills and use that
grace of God which is offered. I doubt not but a great part of
this suggesting power of his, would fall to nothing: as for that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
force of his, by which he lies in wait to annoy us outwardly,
why should we so dread that? Are there not more with us both
in multitude and strength<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> to preserve us? <hi>The Angel of the Lord</hi>
(saith the <hi>Psalmist) pitches his tents round about those that fear him,
to deliver them.</hi> And the Apostle assures us, that the <hi>Angels are
ministring Spirits, sent forth for those, that shall be heirs of Salvation;</hi>
shall we think, that the strength of those to preserve, is less then
that of the evil Angels to destroy? One <hi>Garcaeus</hi> writing upon
the Meteors, told me long since, that whereas many times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
great tempests, there is wont to be heard in the aire above
us great noise, and rushing, the cause of this was the banding of
good, and evil Angels, the one striving to annoy us with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests,
the other striving to preserve us from the danger of it.
And I doubt not, but as about <hi>Moses</hi> body, so about every faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
person, these do contend, the one to hazzard, the other to
deliver. Yea, but the Devil inspires into us evil thoughts:
well, and cannot good Angels inspire good; they are all for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thing appears, by the law of their creation equal, and shall
we think that God did give unto the Devil an inspiring faculty
to entangle, which he denyed to his good Angels to free us?
Though good Angels could not inspire good thoughts, yet God
both can and doth. So that for any thing yet appears, we have
no such cause to stand in fear of the strength of the
Devil, either inwardly or outwardly. Thus have I exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the force of three of our principal enemies; I could proceed
to examine other particulars of this armie of our adversaries,
the world, the flesh, persecutions, and the rest, and make the
like question of them, as I have done of these, and so conclude
as <hi>Socrates</hi> did to <hi>Alcibiades.</hi> If you have just cause to fear none
of these, why should you fear them all, since that of such as
these the whole knot of them consists? But I must proceed to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:114807:98"/>
search out yet another meaning of this word of <hi>doing</hi> in my text;
and that briefly.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, therefore we may take this word of <hi>doing</hi> in its lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
sense: as if the Apostle had meant literally, that indeed a
Christian can do all things, that he had such a power and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
over the creature, as that he could do with it, what he
list. In which sense it is likewise true, though with some limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and here is the third degree of our <hi>Christian Omnipotency.</hi>
In the former parts the omnipotence of a Christian suffered no
restraint: it was illimited, unconfin'd. He is absolutely om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent
in his patience, and can suffer all things: he is likewise
absolutely omnipotent in battel, and can conquer all his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
But in this third signification, his power seems to be
streightned: for how many things are there which no Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
man can do? Yet is he so streightned, as that his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency
suffers not. We are taught in the Schools, though God
be omnipotent, yet many things may be named, which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
do: he cannot denie himself, he cannot lie, he cannot sin,
he cannot die. Yet may we not conclude, that therefore God
is not Omnipotent; for therefore is he the more omnipotent,
because he cannot do these things: for ability to do these things,
is imperfection, and weakness, but in God we must conceive
nothing but what argues perfection and strength. In some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
we may apply this unto our selves, in things that tend to
Christian perfection, every christian is omnipotent; he cannot
raise the dead, turn water into wine, speak with tongues.
True, but if he could, had he for this any further degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
above other Christians? Our Saviour seems to denie it.
<hi>For many</hi> (saith he) <hi>at that day shall come and say, have we not cast
out Devils, and wrought miracles in thy name, and he will answer them,
away, I know you not.</hi> Beloved, our Saviour loves not to sleight
any part of Christian perfection: yet my meaning is not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
unto a christian the power of doing miracles, for every chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
man doth every day greater miracles, then yet I have spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of. But beloved, in this matter of miracles, we do much
abuse our selves; for why? Seems it unto us a greater miracle,
that our Saviour once turn'd a little water into wine, then every
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:114807:99"/>
year in so many Vine-trees to turn that into wine in the branches,
which being received at the root was meer water; or why was
it more wonderfull for him once to feed five thousands with five
Loaves: then every year to feed the whole world, by the
strange multiplication of a few seeds cast into the ground? Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the same manner do we by the dayly actions of christian men.
For why is it a greater miracle to raise the dead, then for every
man to raise himself from the death of sin, to the life of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness?
Why seems it more miraculous to open the eyes of
him that was born blinde, then for every one of us to open the
eyes of his understanding, which by reason, of original corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was born blinde. For by the same finger, by the same po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of God, by which the Apostles wrought these miracles,
doth every christian man do this: and without this finger, it is
as impossible for us to do this, as for the Apostles to do the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles
they did, without the assistance of the extraordinary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of Christ. So that hitherto in nothing are we found inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
unto the chief Apostles: what if there be some things we
cannot do? Shall this prejudice our power? It is a saying in
<hi>Quintilian oportet Grammaticum quaedam ignorare.</hi> It must not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach
the learning of a good <hi>Grammarian</hi> to be ignorant of some
thing: for there are many unnecessary quillets, and quirks in
Grammar, of which to purchase the knowledge, were but loss
of labour and time. Beloved, in the like manner may we speak
of our selves. <hi>Oportet Christianum quaedam non posse,</hi> it must not
disparage the power of a Christian, that he cannot do some
things. For in regard of the height, and excellency of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
these inferiour things, which he cannot do, they are
nought else but Grammar quirks, and to be ambitious to do
them, were but a nice, minute, and over-superstitious diligence.
And yet a christian if he list, may challenge this power, that he
<hi>can do all things;</hi> yea, even such things as he cannot do. Saint
<hi>Austine</hi> answering a question made unto him, why the gift of
tongues was ceased in the <hi>Church,</hi> and no man spake with that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of languages, which divers had in the Primitive times:
wittily tells us, <hi>that every one may justly claim unto himself that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
gift of tongues.</hi> For since the Church, which is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:114807:99"/>
of Christ, of which we are but members, is far and wide
disperst over the earth, and is in sundry nations, which use
sundry languages, every one of us, may well be said to speak
with divers tongues; because in that which is done by the whole,
or by any part of it, every part may claim his share. Beloved,
how much more by this reason, may every one of us, lay a far
directer claim to an absolute power of doing all things, even in
its largest extent, since I say not some inferiour member, but
Christ, who is our head, hath this power truly resident in him.
Howsoever therefore in each member, it seems to be but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
yet in our head it is at full; and every one of us may assume
to our selves this power of <hi>doing all things,</hi> because we are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
members unto that head, which <hi>can do all things,</hi> but
I must leave this, and go on to the remainder of my Text.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto I have spoken first of the person, I. Secondly, of
his power <hi>can do,</hi> I should by order of the words proceed in the
third place, unto the subject or object of this power pointed out
unto us in this word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> 
                     <hi>all things.</hi> But the subject of this
Christian power hath been so necessarily wrapped up, and tyed
together with the power; that for the opening of it, I have been
constrain'd to exemplifie at large, both what this <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> this
<hi>all things</hi> is, and how far it doth extend: so that to enter upon
it a new, were but to trouble you with repetition of what is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
sufficiently opened. I will go on therefore unto the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
general of my Text. For here me thinks that question
might me asked, which <hi>Dalilah</hi> asked of <hi>Sampson: Tell me I pray
thee, wherein this great strength lieth. Behold,</hi> beloved it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
in the last words, <hi>through Christ that strengtheneth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is as I told you that hair, wherein that admirable strength
of a Cristian doth reside. I confess, I have hitherto spoken of
wonderful things, and hardly to be credited; wherefore <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>;
least the strangeness of the
argument call my credit into question. Loe here I present un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
you the ground of all this: A small matter sometimes seems
wonderful till the cause of it be discovered, but as soon as we
know the cause, we cease to marvel: how strong soever my
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:114807:100"/>
discourse of Christian Omnipotency doth seem, yet look but
upon this cause, and now nothing shall seem incredible. For
to doubt of the omnipotency of a Christian, is to question the
power of Christ himself. As the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> told King <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi>
that she had heard great things of him in her own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
but now she saw truth did go beyond report, so, belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
he that travels in the first part of my Text, and wonders
at the strong report of a Christian mans power. Let him come
to the second part, to our <hi>Solomon,</hi> to him that is greater then
<hi>Solomon,</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> and he shall finde that the truth is greater
then the same of it; for if he that was possest of the evil spirit
in the Gospel, was so strong, that he being bound with chains
and fetters, he brake them all: of what strength must he be
then, whom it pleaseth Christ to enable, or what chains or fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
shall be put upon him, which he will not break? From this
doctrine therefore that Christ is he, that doth thus enable us,
we learn two lessons, which are as it were two props to keep us
upright, that we lean not either to the right hand, or to the
left. First, not to be dejected or dismay'd, by reason of this
outward weakness and baseness, in which we seem to be. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
not to be pust up, upon opinion and conceit of that
strength, and glory which is within us and unseen. For the
first, for our own outward weakness, be it what it will, we
cannot be more weak, more frail then <hi>Gideons</hi> Pitchers: now
as in them their frailty was their strength and by being broken
they put to flight the army of the <hi>Midianites:</hi> so where it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
Christ to work, that which seems weakness shall become
strength, and turn to flight the strongest adversary, <hi>Satis sibi
copiarum cum Publio Decio, &amp; nunquam nimium Hostium fore,</hi> said
one in <hi>Livie,</hi> we may apply this unto our selves: be we never
so weak, yet Christ alone is army and forces enough, and with
him, we can never have too many enemies. The flesh indeed
is weak; for our Saviour tells us, yet this weakness of the flesh
is no prejudice at all to the strength of a Christian; for though
the flesh be weak, yet the spirit is strong, and so much our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
tells us too: and why then do we not follow the stronger
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:114807:100"/>
part? <hi>Si spiritus carne fortior, quia generosior, nostra culpa infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ora
sectamur,</hi> saith <hi>Tertullian.</hi> If the spirit be stronger then the
flesh, what madness is it in us to make choice of, and follow
the weaker side?
<q>Nulla sides unquam miseros elegit amicos.</q>
Which of you is so improvident, as in a faction, to make choice
of that side, which he sees to be the weakest, and which he
knows must fall. Again, this weakness of a Christian is only
outward, within what he is, the words of my Text do suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
shew. <hi>Socrates</hi> outwardly was a man of deformed shape,
but he was one of an excellent spirit: and therefore <hi>Alcibiades</hi> in
<hi>Plato</hi> compares him to an <hi>Apothecaries</hi> box, which without had
painted upon it, an <hi>Ape</hi> or a <hi>Satyre,</hi> or some deformed thing,
but within was full of sweet and precious oyntment. Thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
it is with a Christian, whatsoever outward <hi>deformity</hi> he
seems to have, howsoever he seems to be nothing but rags with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
yet he is <hi>totus purpureus,</hi> all scarlet and glorious within: I
have said, <hi>ye are Gods,</hi> saith the Scripture, the Magistrate is
wont to ingrosse, and impropriate this Scripture to himself;
because sitting in place of Authority, for execution of Justice,
he carries some resemblance of God: but to whom can this
Scripture better belong then to the Christian man? For the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
carries indeed some shew of God without, but many
times within is full of corruption and weakness; the Christian
carries a shew of weakness without; but within is full of God
and Christ. The second thing which I told you, we learn't was
a lesson teaching us, not to be puft up with opinion and conceit of
our own inward strength and glory: for if any man, because of
this, shall begin to think of himself, above what he ought. Let
him know that he may say of his exceeding strength, no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
then the man in the book of <hi>Kings,</hi> spake, when his axe
was fallen into the water, <hi>Alas Master, it was but lent.</hi> Those
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:114807:101"/>
that build houses make <hi>Anticks,</hi> which seem to hold up the
beams, whereas indeed as St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells the Olive branch; <hi>Thou
bearest not the root, but the root thee:</hi> So is it true in them, they
bear not up the house, the house bears up them. Beloved, seem
we never so strong, yet we are but <hi>Anticks,</hi> the strength, by
which the house of Christ doth stand; is not ours, it is Christs,
who by that power, by <hi>which he is able to subdue all things to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
doth sustain both himself and us.</p>

to know but it is according to the proverb, as the <hi>Cat</hi> desires fish,

is indeed a thing very pleasant; but to learn is a thing harsh

sweet as hony but bitter in his belly. Beloved those <hi>Librorum hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luones</hi>
students that like S. <hi>John</hi> eat up whole volums, these finde
the contrary: For in the mouth in the perusal, their books are
harsh and unpleasant; but in the stomach when they are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood,
and digested then are they delightful and pleasurable:
yet one thing by the providence of God our nature hath which
makes this rough way to learn more plain and easie: it is
<gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> common experience shews, we are all very desirous
to hear narrations and reports either pleasant or strange: Wise
men therefore and God himself which is wiser then men being
to train up mankinde <hi>Genus indocile,</hi> a subject dull of hearing,
and hardly drawn to learn, have from time to time wrought
upon this humor, upon this part of our disposition and miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated,
sugred as it were the unpleasantness of a difficult, and
hard lesson with the sweetnes of some delightful parable or fable:
And S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> tells us of a Physician, who finding his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
to abhor Physick, but infinitely long for wine, heating an
earthen cup in the fire, and quenching it in wine, put his potion
therein, that so the sick person being deceived with the smell of
wine, might unawares drink of the Physick: or that I may bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
draw my comparison from Scripture, as when <hi>Jacob</hi> meant to

and so got access: So beloved, wisemen when they meant
either to instruct the ignorant, or to reprove offenders to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
their welcome, and make their way more passable, have
been wont for the most part, as it were to clothe their lesson or
reproof in a parable, or to serve it in a dish savouring of wine

smell of the pleasantness of wine might draw down the wholsom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of Physick: Great and singular have been those effects
which this kinde of teaching by parables hath wrought in men,
by informing their ignorance, reproving their error, working pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:114807:102"/>

Authors, but whole cities, and men which gave Laws to
Common-wealths have made especial choice of this course;
Yea, our Saviour Christ himself hath filled the Gospels with
parables, made them like a Divine and Christian <hi>AEsop's Fables,</hi>
because he found it to be exceeding profitable. For first of all it
is the plainest and most familiar way, and above all other stoops
to the capacity of the learner, as being drawn either from trees,
or beasts, or from some ordinary common and known actions of
men: As from a shepheard attending his flock, from an husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
sowing corn in his field, from a fisher casting his net into
the Sea, from a woman putting leaven into her dough, or the
like. So that in this respect a parable is like <hi>Moses</hi> Tabernacle
which outwardly was nothing but goats skins, or some ordinary
stuff, but within it was silk, and purple and gold. And indeed
since those we teach are either children or ignorant persons who
are but children (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
for every man in what he is ignorant is no better then a
childe) that manner of information fits best, which is most ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
and familiar: Again, a parable is a kinde of pattern and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
expressing unto us what we heare; Now nothing doth
more illustrate and explain then instance and example <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> in a parable as it were upon a stage, the thing that
we are taught is in a manner acted, and set forth before our
eyes. Secondly, parables do not only by their plainess open the
understanding but they work upon the affections, and breed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
of hearing by reason of that faceteness and wittiness which
is many times found in them, by reason of which they insinuate
themselves, and creep into us, and ere we are aware work that
end for which they were delivered: who is not much moved
with that parable of <hi>Jotham</hi> in the book of Judges, <hi>that the trees
went forth to chuse a king,</hi> or that of <hi>Menenius Agrippa</hi> in Livie,
that the parts of the body conspired against the belly, by which
the one shewed the wickedness of the men of <hi>Sechem</hi> against
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:114807:103"/>
the sons of <hi>Gideon,</hi> the other the folly of the common
people in conspiring against the <hi>Senators</hi> and noble-men.
And no marvel beloved, if this faceteness of parables doth thus
work with men, since it seems to have had wonderful force with
God himself. For when the <hi>Canaanitish</hi> woman in the Gospel
had long importun'd our Saviour in the behalf of her daughter,
and our Saviour had answered her with that short cutting and
reproachful parable; <hi>It is not meet to take the childrens bread and
cast it unto dogs,</hi> she facetely and wittily retorts and turns upon
our Saviour his own parable. <hi>Truth Lord,</hi> saith she, <hi>yet dogs do
eat the crums that fall from their masters Table:</hi> be it that I am but a
dog: I require no more then is due to a dog: even the crums
that fall from your table, with which speech our Saviour was so
far taken, as that he seems to have been stricken into a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
for he presently cries out, <hi>O woman great is thy Faith.</hi>
Thirdly, there is one thing that this way of instruction by para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
hath above all other kindes of teaching. It serves excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
for reproof; for man is a proud creature, impatient of plain
and open check and reprehension: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times no way of dealing with him, when he hath offended,
but by deceiving him with wiliness and craft, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: he that
comes rudely and plainly to reprehend, doth many times more
hurt then good. I speak not this only in regard of ministerial
reprehension, used by the preacher of the word: but of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for to reprove offenders is a common duty, and belongs
to every private man as well as to the Minister. St. <hi>Austine</hi>
in his book <hi>de civitate Dei,</hi> handling the question, why in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
calamities the good do bear a part as well as the evil, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
many other reasons gives this as a special one, that good
men are not careful enough in reproving the errors of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
brethren, but by connivency and silence in a manner
partake in their sins, and as it were by consent, make them their
own. It shall not be amiss therefore, even for you of the Laity
to hear something concerning this art of <hi>reprehension,</hi> as a duty
concerning you as well as the Preacher. For the wisdome and
gentleness of a Christian is never better seen, then in reproving.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:114807:103"/>
Now one common error of reprehenders is their over-blunt,
and plain manner of rebuking, <hi>dum sic objurgent quasi oderint,</hi>
whilest they reprove the vice, as if they hated the person, and
upbraid rather then reprehend. By this our importunity we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
more sinners then we save. It is an excellent observation
in St. <hi>Chrysostome,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
unseasonable and importunate reprehenders
make offending persons, <hi>depudere</hi> to steal their forehead, and to
set a good face upon their fact, as the phrase of the world is,
and to seek out excuses and Apologies for their sinne.
<hi>Tully</hi> tells us, that <hi>Antonie</hi> the Orator being to defend a person,
who was accused of faction and sedition, bent his wits to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
sedition was good, and not to be objected as a fault. That
we force not our offending Brethren unto this degree of impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency,
let us consult with our charity; and know the quality and
nature of the offender. Husbandmen tell us, that the young
and tender branches of a Vine are not to be prun'd away with a
knife, but gently pull'd away by hand. Beloved, before we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove,
let us know the condition of our brother, whether he be
not like the young Vine soft and tender, and so to be cured ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the hand, then with the knife: and if he be grown so
hard, that he shall need the knife, we must not rashly adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of it, but know there is a skill likewise in using the knife;
as <hi>Ehud</hi> in the book of <hi>Judges,</hi> when he went to kill <hi>Eglon</hi> carries
not his Dagger in his hand, but comes unto him with a present,
and had his Dagger girt privily under his garment, or as a
skilful Physician of whom we read, being to heal an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stume,
and finding the sick person to be afraid of Lancing, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
wrap't up his <hi>knife</hi> in a <hi>spunge,</hi> with which whilest he gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
smoothed the place, he lanced it: so beloved, when we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter
our offending Brother, we must not openly carry the
Dagger in our hand, for this were to defie our Brother: but
we must wrap our knife in our spunge, and lance him whilest
we smooth him: and with all sweetness, and gentleness of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
cure him; as <hi>Esay</hi> the Prophet cur'd <hi>Hezekias,</hi> by laying
a plaister of Figs upon the sore. Men when they have offended
are like unto fire, we must take heed how we come too near
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:114807:104"/>
them; and therefore as the <hi>Cherubin</hi> in the book of <hi>Esays</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie
takes a cole from the Altar with the tongs: so when
the prophets dealt with them, they did not rudely handle them
with their hands; but they came upon them warily under pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables,
as it were with the <hi>Cherubins</hi> tongs. How could <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
have come so near unto King <hi>David,</hi> and drawn from him
an acknowledgement of his sin, had he not come with the <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubins</hi>
tongs, and deceived him with a parable, or how
should the prophet made King <hi>Ahab</hi> see his error in letting go
King <hi>Benhadad,</hi> if he had not as it were put a trick upon the
King, and disguised both himself and his speech, and mask't his
errand with the parable of him, who let go the prisoner that
was committed to his charge. So that in this respect, if we
would define a parable we must pronounce it to be <hi>Piam fraudem</hi>
a civil or spiritual <hi>Stratagem,</hi> by which persons who need instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
are honestly and piously beguiled for their own profit.
No marvel therefore, if our Saviour Christ in his preaching
doth every where drive upon parables. For being to deliver to
us so many lessons, so strange, so uncouth, so hard to learn, it
was meet he should make choice of that method of teaching,
which hath most likelihood to prevail and commend them unto
us. The doctrine which our Saviour in my text labours to beat
into us, is the continuing and perpetuating of our prayer and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
meditation. A lesson hard to be attained, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
thrice he commends it unto us; once by example, twice
by parable, both of them very effectual means to teach: by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of that importunate <hi>Canaanitish</hi> woman in the 15. of Saint
<hi>Matthew:</hi> by parable first in the 11. of <hi>Luke,</hi> of him that lying
warm in his bed, and loath to rise, yet at his Friends importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
gets up, and lends him bread: and secondly, by the parable
of the unjust Judge here in my text.</p>
                  <p>But all this while I must not forget, that I am but in the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
in the <hi>Porch,</hi> and entrance into the Temple, where to
walk too long, were, if not to loose, yet to abuse my time. Let
us now therefore enter into the temple it self, and consider the
main words of my text. <hi>That men ought always to pray, and not to
faint:</hi> which words have a double meaning. First, there is <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:114807:104"/>
quem faciunt;</hi> there is a sense which the words themselves
yield as they lie. Secondly, <hi>Sensus quo fiunt,</hi> the sense and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in which the Holy Ghost intended and spake them. If we
look upon the sense which the words themselves do give; it
seems we are advised by them to be like <hi>Anna</hi> the Prophetess in
the second of <hi>Luke,</hi> who departed not from the temple, but ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
God with fasting and prayer night and day. In all places,
at all times, in season, out of season, upon occasion, upon no
occasion, perpetually without intermission to pray. For thus
the words do run, <hi>that we ought alwayes to pray, and not to faint.</hi>
But if we look upon the sense in which the Holy Ghost Spake
these words, and consider what was his intent, when he
wrote them, we shall finde that the lesson which we are hence
to learn is, that we be like unto <hi>Jacob</hi> in the book of <hi>Genesis,</hi>
wrastle with God, and tell him to his face, <hi>That we will not let
him go till he hath given us his blessing.</hi> That we become like bold
fac't suitors or impudent beggars that will not be put by with a
denial: but when we have powred out our supplications unto
God, and finde his ear lockt up against us, yet to commence
them again and again, and the third time; yea, without any
fainting or giving over, till by a kinde of importunate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mannerly
devotion we have constrain'd God to let a blessing
fall: and that this was the intent of the Holy Ghost in this place,
it appears upon the very reading of the parable. I will briefly
speak unto you of both these <hi>senses</hi> in their order, and first of
the <hi>sense</hi> which the words do give. <hi>That we ought alwayes without
intermission to pray.</hi> Devotion in ordinary persons is a thing easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
raised, and easily alayed, Every strange event, every fear,
every little calamity or distress is enough to put us into a strain
of religious meditation, but on the contrary side a small mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
doth again as quickly kill it. It seems to be like a <hi>quotidian</hi>
Ague, it comes by fits, every day it takes us, and every day it
leaves us: or like flax or straw, or such light and drie stuffe,
which easily kindles, and as soon goes out. Indeed it is a good
thing when we finde out hearts thus tender, and upon every oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
ready to melt into devotion: for as to be quick of sense is
a signe of life, and the purest and best complexions are quickest
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:114807:105"/>
of sense: so it is a great argument of spiritual life in us, and of
purity of soul, when we are <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> so easily apt to fall upon
devout meditation. But our Saviour requires yet another qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
in our devotion: it must be as lasting as it is quick. <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian</hi>
advises his Orator to beware how he stand too long upon a
place of passion: because that passion is not lasting, <hi>&amp; nihil fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius
lachrymis in arescit;</hi> and men cannot long weep. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
our Saviour gives other precepts of Christian Oratory:
he wills, if we will prevail with God to insist and dwell long
upon a place of religious passion, and provide that our tears
may be perpetual and never drie: an hard thing you will take
it to be; yet certainly it is very possible. There is a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
raised among the great masters of Natural learning, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no there may be a <hi>lamp</hi> so provided, that it may burn
for ever. And they think it may be done: beloved, our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
here teaches to practise that in spirituals, which hath been
but a matter of speculation in Naturals, even so to kindle and
dress our lamps, as that they shall never go out, but be like unto
the good Huswifes candle in the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> that goes not out by
night, or rather like the sun which shines for evermore. <hi>Daniel</hi>
is said to have kindled this lamp, and to have made his prayer
thrice a day, <hi>David</hi> seven times a day, but this is not enough;
for in that the one is noted to have prayed seven times a day, the
other thrice: It is likely at other times they did not pray, but God
is not contented with this Intermittent prayer; for if we look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
my text, we shall see that there must be no instant free from
prayer: we must not measure our prayers by number. Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
is a Discrete quantity as we call it, the parts of it are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next,
are not tyed together, there is a separation, a distance
betwixt them. That that measures out our prayer must be line
and length, some continued quantity, whose parts have no se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,
no intermission: For so saith my text, <hi>men ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to pray. Alwayes,</hi> the whole life of a man ought to be but
one continual prayer. But let us a little consider how possible
this is, and see if there be any thing, that doth necessarily enforce
intermission of prayer. And first, that wonderful lamp of
which I but now told you great Schollers had spoken, is not yet
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:114807:105"/>
made, because they are not agreed of what matter to make it.
And indeed in the world, things either are not at all, or being,
do at length cease to be, either because there is no fit matter
whence they may be framed, or else the matter of which they
are made, vanishes and dies. But beloved, prayer is a strange
thing, it can never want matter: It will be made <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
è <hi>quolibet</hi> out of any matter, upon any occasion whatsoever,
whatsoever you do, wheresoever you are, doth minister occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of some kinde of prayer, either of thanksgiving unto God for
his goodness, or of praysing, and admiring his greatness, or of
petitioning to him in case of want or distress, or bewailing some
sin or neglect committed. Is it the consideration of Gods bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
that will move us to thankfulness? Then certainly our
thankfulness ought to be perpetual, there is no person so mean,
no soul so poor, and distressed and miserable, but if he search
narrowly, he shall finde some blessing, for which he ows thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
unto God. If nothing else, yet his very misery and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stress
is a singular blessing, if he use it to that end for which it
was sent. Is it the consideration of distress and affliction, and
some degree of the curse of God upon us that will stir our devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Indeed this is it with most men that kindles the fire of
prayer in our hearts. Men for the most part are like unto the
unslak't Lime, which never heats till you throw water upon it;
so they never grow warm in devotion till somewhat contrary to
their wishes and disposition begins to afflict them: then certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
our petitions to God ought never to cease. For never was
there man in any moment of his life entirely happy, either in
body, goods, or good name, every man hath some part of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction?
Blessing and cursing, though they seem to be enemies,
and contrary one to another, yet are never severed, but go hand
in hand together. Some men have more of one, some of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
but there is no man but hath some part of both; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as it seems not only prayer in general, but all kind, all sort
of prayer ought to be continual. Prayer must not be, as it
were of one thred, we must blend and temper together all kind
of prayer, our praise or thanks, our sorrow, and make our
prayer like <hi>Josephs particolored Coat,</hi> like a beautiful garment of
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:114807:106"/>
sundry colours. So then as fire goes not out so long as it hath
matter to feed on, so what shall be able to interrupt our devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which hath so great and everlasting store of matter to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, many things in the world are necessarily intermitted,
because they are tyed to place or times; all places all times are
not convenient for them; but in case of prayer it is otherwise, it
seeks no place, it attends no time; It is not necessary we should
come to the Church, or expect a Sabbath or an holy-day, for
prayer indeed especially was the Sabbaoth ordained, yet prayer
it self is Sabboathless, and admits no rest, no intermission at
all: If our hands be clean we must as our Apostle commands us
lift them up <hi>every where</hi> at all times and make every place a
Church, every day a Sabbaoth, every hour Canonical, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>:
As you go to the market, as you stand
in the streets, as you walk in the fields in all these places ye may
pray as well and with as good acceptance as in the Church, For
you your selves are temples of the holy Ghost, if the grace of
God be in you more precious then any of those which are made
with hands; The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath made a part of her <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viary,</hi>
or <hi>Common Prayer Book,</hi> which she calls <hi>Itinerarium Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricorum,</hi>
and it is a set form of prayer, which Clergy-men ought
to use when they set out in a journey and are upon their way,
why she calls it <hi>Itinerarium Clericorum,</hi> and impropriates it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Clergy, I know not, she might, for ought I see, have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
it <hi>Itinerarium Laicorum.</hi> The <hi>Itinerary</hi> of the Laity: since it
is a duty belonging unto them as well as to the Minister. Yet thus
much the example of that Church teaches, that no place no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
excludes Prayer. We read in our books that one of the
Ethnick Emperors was much taken when he saw a <hi>woman</hi> go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the streets with her vessel of water on her head, her childe
at her girdle, her spindle in her hand twisting her threed as she
went: He thought it a wonderful portion of diligence thus to
employ all places and times indifferently. Beloved if it be thus
with bodily labor, how much more should it be so with the
labor of the soul, which is far more easie and needs not the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:114807:106"/>
help of any bodily instrument to act it. And how welcome a
spectacle will it be think you unto the great King of Heaven and
Earth when he shall see that no time, no occasion, is able to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the labour of our devotion? Is it the time of Feasting and
Jollity, which seems to prescribe against prayer: Indeed pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is a grave and sober action and seems not to stand with sport
and merriment; yet notwithstanding it is of so pliable a nature,
that it will accommodate and fit it self even to feasts and sport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
we read in the book of <hi>Daniel</hi> that when <hi>Belshazzer</hi> made
his great and last feast to his Princes and Lords that they were
merry and drank wine in bowls and praysed the <hi>Gods of Gold and
Silver, of Brass, and of Iron, of Wood, and of Stone.</hi> Beloved, shall
Ethnick feasts finde room for their Idolatrous worship, and
praise of their Golden, Brazen, Wooden Gods, and shall not
our Christian Feasts yield some place for the praise of the true
God of Heaven and Earth. Last of all is it time of sleep that
seems to give a vacation, and <hi>otium</hi> to prayer? Beloved, sleep is
no part of our life, we are not accountable for things done or
not done then. <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us that an unclean dream shall
no more condemn us then a dream of Martyrdom shall
crown us: and the <hi>Casuists</hi> do teach that loose dreams in the
night shall never bee laid to our charge if they be not occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by lewd thoughts in the day: for they are <hi>Cogitationes injectae
non enatae,</hi> they are not thoughts springing out, but cast into our
hearts by the Devil, upon his score shall they go and we shall
not reckon for them: So then though sleep partake not of our
devotion, yet this hinders not the continualness of it. <hi>Aristotle</hi>
tells us that men who sleep perceive not any part of time to have
passed; because they tie the last moment of their watching
with the first moment of their awaking, as having no sense of
what past betwixt, and so account of it, as one continued time.
Beloved, if we do with our devotion, as we do with our time,
if we shut up the last instant of our watching with a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and resume that prayer at the first instant of our wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,
we have made it one continued prayer: without interru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, and last of all the greatest reason why many businesses
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:114807:107"/>
of the world cannot be acted perpetually, is because they must
give room to others, <hi>Unicum arbustum non alit duos Erithacos:</hi> The
actions of the world are many times like unto quarrelsome birds,
two of them cannot peaceably dwell in one bush. But prayer
hath that property which <hi>Aristotle</hi> gives unto substance <hi>nulli esse
contrarium,</hi> it is at peace and holds good terms with all our
cares of the world. No business so great, or that so much
takes up the time and minde of a man as that it needs exclude
prayer: It is of a soft and sociable nature, and it can incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
and sink into our business like water into Ashes and never
increase the bulk of them: It can mix and interweave it self
with all our cares without any hinderance unto them: Nay, it is
a great strength and improvement unto them, <gap reason="foreign">

cares of this life, which are no better then buildings of dirt

much to require at the hands of men at one and the self same in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant

wonderful thing to see how many things it will at one moment
apply it self unto without any confusion or let. Look but upon

without any distraction or impediment: Thus should men

not her eyes, yet her minde unto Heaven, and consecrate and
hallow her work with earnest prayer unto God. <hi>Arator stivam
tenens Hallelujah secantat, sudans messor Psalmis sese evocat &amp; curvâ
attondens falce vites vinitor aliquid Davidicum canit.</hi> The Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
(saith St. <hi>Hierome</hi>) at the Plough-tail may sing an Halle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lujah,
the sweating Harvest-man may refresh himself with a
Psalm, the Gardiner whilest he prunes his Vines and Arbors,
may record some one of <hi>Davids</hi> sonnets. The reason of this
pliable nature of prayer is, because it is a thing of another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
then the acts of the world are. It requires no outward
labour of the body, no outward fashion and manner of doing,
but is internally acted in the soul it self, and leaves the outward
members of our bodies free to perform those offices which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
their help. Our legal business in the world must be done
in certain forms of <hi>breves</hi> and writs, and I know not what vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety
of outward ceremony, or else it is not warrantable. But
prayer, beloved, is not like an obligation or indenture, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
no outward solemnity of words and ceremony. Quaint,
witty, and set forms of prayer proceed many times from osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
more then devotion: for any thing I know, it requires
not so much as the moving of the lips or tongue. Nay, one
thing I know more, that the most forcible prayer transcends and
far exceeds all power of words. For St. <hi>Paul</hi> speaking unto us
concerning the most effectual kinde of prayer, calls it <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
sighs and groans that cannot be expressed. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
does crie so loud in the ears of God, as the sighing of a
contrite and earnest heart, we read in the 14. of <hi>Exodus,</hi> that
God speaks unto <hi>Moses, why cryest thou unto me, command the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Israel that they go forward:</hi> yet there appears not in the text
any prayer that <hi>Moses</hi> made, or word that he spake. It was
the earnestness of <hi>Moses</hi> heart, that was so <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> that
did so sound in the ears of the Lord. Wherefore true prayer
hath no commerce with the outward members of the body, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:114807:108"/>
not the voice, but the minde, not the stretching of the hands,
but the intension of the soul; not any outward shape or carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age

                     </gap>
how then can it slacken your worldly business and occasions, to
mix with them sighs and groans, which are the most effectual
kindes of prayer. And let this suffice concerning the first mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the words; I will briefly speak concerning the second
meaning which I told you was the sense intended by the Holy
Ghost when he wrote, and it is an exhortation to a religious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
in our prayers: not to let our suits fall, because they
are not presently granted, but never to leave solliciting, till we
have prevailed, and so take the blessings of God by violence,
<hi>Gratissima vis.</hi> This force, this violence is a thing most welcome
unto God; for if the importunity of <hi>Esau's</hi> false, feigned, and
malicious tears drew a blessing from his Father <hi>Isaac,</hi> who yet
had no greater store of blessings, as it seems, how much more
shall the true religious importunity of zealous prayer pull a bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
out of the hands of God, who is rich in blessings above the
sands of the Sea in multitude? It is the Courtiers rule, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
modest suitors seldome speed. Beloved, we must follow
the same rule in the Court of Heaven: intempestive bashfulness
gets nothing there. <hi>Qui timide rogat, docet negare,</hi> Faint asking
does invite a denial; will you know the true name of the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
which prevails with God; St. <hi>Luke</hi> in his 11. Chapter
calls it <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> and St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> speaking of the behaviour
of the <hi>Canaanitish</hi> woman in the 25. of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> tells us, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity,
importunity, impudency, these be the names of that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
&amp; behaviour, which you must put on, if you mean to prevail
in your suits with God. And indeed, if we consider that habit
and manner, that God is wont to put on, when his children do
become suitors unto him, how he puts on a rigid, rough and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable
carriage, even towards his dearest children, even then
when he means them most good, we shall plainly see, we must
use such kinde of behaviour,if we will prevail with him, for the
more effectually to express this demeanor of God toward his
children, and to assure us it is so, and to teach us importunity,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:114807:108"/>
our Saviour Christ, that great Master of requests, may seem to
have done himself some wrong; first, by drawing in a manner
odious comparisons, and likening the behaviour of God in these
cases to a slothful friend, that is loath to leave his warm bed,
to do his friend a pleasure, and here in my text to an unjust
Judge, that fears neither God nor man; and secondly, by his
own behaviour toward the <hi>Canaanitish</hi> woman. It is strange to
observe, how though he were the meekest person that ever was
upon earth, yet here he strives as it were to unnaturalize him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and lay by his natural sweetness of disposition, almost to
forget common humanity, and puts on a kinde of sullen, and
surly person of purpose to deter her: you shall not finde our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
in all the New Testament in such a mood, so bent to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
and vilifie a poor suitor. St. <hi>Austine</hi> comparing together
St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> who both of them record the same sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
and gathering together the circumstances out of them both,
tells us, that first she follows our Saviour in the street, and that
our Saviour takes house as it were to shelter himself from her,
but she comes after, and throws her self at his feet: and he as
offended with her importunity, again quits the house to be rid
of her, and all this while deigns her not a word. If any beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
could have dasht a suit, and broken the heart of a poor
suiter, this had been enough, but here's not all, we have a civil
precept, that if we be not disposed to pleasure a suiter, yet to
give him good words and shape him a gentle answer, it is hard
if we cannot afford a suiter a gentle wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>. We read of <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi>
the Emperour, (as I remember) that he would never suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
any man to go sad and discontented from him, yet our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
seems to have forgot this part of civility, being importun'd
to answer her, gives her an answer worse then silence, and
speaks words like the piercing of a sword, as <hi>Solomon</hi> speaks. I
<hi>may not take the childrens bread and cast it unto dogs.</hi> And yet after
all this strange copie of countenance, he fully subscribes to her
request. Beloved, God hath not only exprest thus much in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables,
and practised these strange delays upon <hi>Canaanitish</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
but he hath acted it indeed, and that upon his dearest
Saints. <hi>David</hi> one of the worthiest of his Saints, yet how passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:114807:109"/>
doth he cry out, <hi>How long Lord wilt thou forget me? How
long shall I seek counsel in my soul and be so vexed in my heart.</hi> Not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Saints on earth, but even those in heaven do seem to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
in this demeanor of God, we read in the book of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
that when the souls of the Martyrs under the Altar cried
out, <hi>how long Lord just and holy dost thou not avenge our blood from off
the earth;</hi> they received this answer, <hi>have patience yet a little while.</hi>
It is storyed of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> that he was wont to supplicate to the <hi>sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,</hi>
and to hold out his hands and beg of them, that so he might
learn to brook and devour denial, and tediousness of suit. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
let us but meditate upon these examples, which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
and we shall not need to practice any of the <hi>Cynics art.</hi> For
if the Saints and blessed Martyrs have their suites so long depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the Courts of Heaven then good reason that we should
learn to brook delays, and arm our selves with patience and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation,
when we finde the ears of God not so open to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests.
When <hi>Josephs</hi> brethren came down to buy corn, he gave
them but a course welcome he spake roughly unto them, he laid
them in prison; yet the text tells us that his bowels melted upon
them and at length he opened himself, and gave them courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
entertainment. Beloved, when we come unto God as it
were to buy corn, to beg at his hands such blessings as we need
though he speak roughly, though he deal more roughly with us,
yet let us know he hath still <hi>Josephs</hi> bowels, that his heart melts
towards us, and at length he will open himself, and entertain us

beloved, if the wisdom of God shall not think it fit to perform
our requests, yet he will give us the long white garment; some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

                  <p>AS in the Kingdomes of the world, there is an art

manage them: so in the spiritual Kingdom of
God, and of Christ, there is an holy policie;
there is an art of spiritual Courtship, which
teaches every subject there, how to demean
and bear himself. But, as betwixt their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes,
so betwixt their arts and Courtship, betwixt the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier

of them I shall have occasion to touch in the process of my
discourse; mean while I will single out one, which I will use as
a prologue, and way unto my text. In the Kingdomes of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Princes, every subject is not fit to make a Courtier; yea,
were all fit, this were an honour to be communicated only unto
some: <hi>Sic opus est mundo.</hi> There is a necessity of disproportion
and inequality between men and men: and were all persons

                     </gap> as <hi>Aristotle</hi> calls them, men of
more then common wit and ability, active, choice, pickt out
of a thousand, such must they be that bear honors, attend on
Princes persons, and serve in their Courts. The Scripture tells
us that when King <hi>Solomon</hi> saw that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> was an active, able,
and industrious young man, he took him and made him ruler
over all the charge of the house of <hi>Joseph.</hi> Again, when <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
invited old <hi>Barzillai</hi> to the Court, the good old man excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
himself: I am, saith he, fourscore years of Age, and can thy
servant <hi>tast what I eat,</hi> or what <hi>I drink: can I hear any more the
voyce of singing men and singing women: Lo here my son</hi> Chimham,
<hi>he shall go with my Lord the King, and do with him as shall seem good
in thine eyes. Jeroboam and Chimham,</hi> strong and able, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
persons such are they that dwell in Kings houses: of the
rest some are too old, some too young, some too dull, some
too rude, or by some means or other unfit for such an end. Thus
fares it with the honors of the world, they seem to participate of
envy, or melancholy, and are of a solitary disposition they
are brightest when they are alone, or but in few make them
common and they loose their grace, like lamps they may give
light unto few, or to some one room, but no farther. But
the honors in the Court of the great King of Heaven, ore of
another nature, they rejoyce in being communicated, and their
glory is in the multitude of those that do partake in them. They
are like unto the Sun that rises <hi>non homini sed humano generi:</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>

to this or that man, but to all the world; In the Court of God
no difference between <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and <hi>Barzillai,</hi> none too old,
none too young: no indisposition, no imperfection, makes you
uncapable of honors there; Be but of his Kingdom, and you
are necessarily of his Court: Every man who is a subject
there, is a Courtier; yea, more then a Courtier, he is a Peer, he
is a King, and hath an army of Angels at his service to
pitch their tents about him, to deliver him; a guard of
Ministring Spirits sent out to attend him for his safety.
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:114807:110"/>
It shall not therefore be unseasonable for the meanest person
that hears me this day to hear as it were a Lecture of Spiritual
policy and Courtship: For no Auditory can be unfit for such a
lesson. <hi>Aristotle</hi> was wont to divide his lectures and readings
into Acroamatical, and Exoterical, some of them contained
onely choice matter, and they were read privately to a <hi>Select
Auditory:</hi> others contain'd but ordinary stuff and were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miscuously
and in publick exposed to the hearing of all that
would; Beloved we read no Acroamatick Lectures: The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets
of the Court of Heaven (as far as it hath pleased the King
of Heaven to reveal them) lie open alike to all. Every man is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
of his Court, alike of his Councel: and the meanest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Christians must not take it to be a thing without his
Sphere, above his reach, but must make account of himself as a
fit hearer of a lesson in Spiritual and saving policy; since if
he be a subject in the kingdom of Christ, he can be no less then a
Courtier.</p>
                  <p>Now the first and main lesson to be learned by a Courtier, is
how to discover and know the disposition, &amp; nature of the Lord,
whom he is to serve, and the quality of that Common-wealth
in which he bears a place, <hi>ad consilium de republica dandum caput est.</hi>
That therefore our heavenly Courtier may not mistake himself,
but be able to fit himself to the place he bears. I have made
choice of these few words, which but now I read; words spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
by the King of that Common-wealth of which I am to
treat, unto such as mean to be his Liege-men there: words which
sufficiently open unto the Christian politician the state and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of that Court in which he is to serve: <hi>My kingdom is not of this
world, for if at were then would my servants fight;</hi> which words seem
like the <hi>Parthian</hi> horsmen, whose manner was to ride one way,
but to shoot another way, they seem to go apace towards <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi>
but they aim and shot at another mark, or rather like unto
the speaker of them unto our Saviour himself when he was in
one of the Villages of <hi>Samaria, Luke</hi> the ninth, where the text
notes that though he were in <hi>Samaria, yet his face was set towards
Hierusalem:</hi> so beloved, though these words be spoken to a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritane</hi>
to an infidel to <hi>Pilate,</hi> yet their face is toward <hi>Hierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
                     <pb n="160" facs="tcp:114807:111"/>
they are a lesson directed to the subjects of his Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Kingdom of that <hi>Hierusalem</hi> which is from above and is
the Mother of us all. In them we may consider two General
parts. First, a <hi>Denuntiation</hi> and message unto us; and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
a <hi>signe</hi> to confirme the truth of it. For it is the
manner and method as it were which God doth use, when he
dispatches a message, to annex a signe unto it, by which it
may be known. When he sent <hi>Moses</hi> to the <hi>Israelites</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> required a signe, he gave him a signe in his hand, in
his Rod; when he sent <hi>Gideon</hi> against <hi>Madian</hi> he gave him a
signe in the Fleece of Wool which was upon the Floor;
when he sent the Prophet to <hi>Hieroboam</hi> to prophesie against
the Altar in <hi>Bethel,</hi> he gave him a signe that the Altar should
rend, and the ashes fall out, when he sent <hi>Esay</hi> with a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
to King <hi>Ahaz,</hi> he gave him a signe; <hi>Behold a Virgin shall
conceive:</hi> So Beloved in these words, <hi>There is a Message, There
is a Signe:</hi> The first words are the Message; <hi>My Kingdom is not
of this world,</hi> &amp;c. The next words, <hi>For if it were then would
my servants fight,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>These are</hi> Moses <hi>rod and</hi> Gideons
<hi>Fleece they are the signe which confirm the Message.</hi> The first
part is a general proposition or Maxime: the second is an
example, and particular instance of it. For in the first our
Saviour distinguishes his Kingdome from the kingdomes
of the world, and from all the fashions of them. In
the second, amongst many other he chuses one instance,
Wherein particularly he notes, that his Kingdome is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
to earthly kingdomes. For the kingdoms of the world are
purchased and maintain'd by violence and blood, but so is not his.
The reason why our Saviour fastens upon this reason of dissimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
and unlikeness is, because in gaining and upholding tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Kingdomes, nothing so usual as the sword and war. No
Kingdome of the world, but by the sword is either gotten or
held, or both. The sword in a secular common wealth is like
the rod in a School, remove that away and men will take their
liberty. It is the plea which the <hi>Tarquins</hi> used to King <hi>Porsenna</hi>
in <hi>Livie. Satis libertatem ipsam habere dulcedinis, nisi quantâ vi
civitates eam expetant tantâ regna reges defendant, aequare summa
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:114807:111"/>

                        </expan> pulcherrimae.</hi>
The taste of liberty is so sweet, that except Kings maintain their
authority with as great violence, as the people affect their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
all things will run to confusion; and Kingdomes which are
the goodliest things in the world, will quickly go to wrack:
when God gave a temporal Kingdome unto his own people, he
sent <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Joshua</hi> before them to purchase it with the sword,
when they were possest of this Kingdome, he sends then <hi>Gideon</hi>
and <hi>Sampson,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and many worthies more to maintain
it by the sword. But now being to open unto the world ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
kinde of Kingdome, of rule and government, then hitherto
it had been acquainted with: he tells us, that he is a King of
a Kingdome which is erected and maintained not by <hi>Joshua</hi> and
<hi>David,</hi> but by <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> not by the sword, but by the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
not by violence, but by love, not by striving, but by yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
not by fighting, but by dying. <hi>Pilate</hi> had heard, that he
was a King. It was the accusation which was fram'd against
him, that he bare himself as King of the Jews; But because,
he saw no pomp, no train, no guard about him, he took it but
as an idle report. To put him therefore out of doubt, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
assures him, that he is a King, but of such a Kingdome
as he could not skill of: <hi>My Kingdome is not of this world,</hi> &amp;c.
For the better unfolding of which words; first we will consider
what the meaning of this word <hi>Kingdome</hi> is, for there lies an
ambiguity in it. Secondly we will consider what lessons for
our instruction the next words will yield, <hi>Not of this world;</hi> first
of this word <hi>Kingdome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Our Saviour is a King three manner of wayes, and so corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latively
hath three distinct several Kingdomes. He is first a
King in the largest extent and meaning which can possibly be
imagined, and that is, as he is Creator and absolute Lord of all
creatures. Of this Kingdome, Heaven, Earth, and Hell are
three large provinces. Angels, Men, and Devils, his very e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies,
every creature visible and invisible are subjects of this
Kingdome. The glory and strength of this Kingdome consists
least of all in men, and man is the weakest part of it. For there
is scarcely a creature in the world, by whom he hath not been
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:114807:112"/>
conquer'd. When <hi>Alexander</hi> the great had travelled through
<hi>India,</hi> and over-run many large provinces, and conquer'd many
popular Cities; when tidings came, that his Soldiers in <hi>Greece</hi>
had taken some small towns there, he scorn'd the news, and in
contempt, me thinks (said he) I hear of the battel of Frogs and
mice. Beloved, if we look upon these huge armies of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and consider of what wonderful strength they are, when
the Lord summons them to battel: all the armies of men, and
famous battels, of which we have so large histories in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison
of these what are they, but a <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
but <hi>Homers</hi> tale, a battel of Frogs and Mice. Infinite legions of
Angels attend him in Heaven, and every <hi>Angel</hi> is an Armie:
one Angel in the Book of <hi>Kings</hi> is sent out against the army of
the <hi>Assyrians,</hi> and in one night foure-score thousand persons die
for it. Base and contemptible creatures, when God calls for
them, are of strength to conquer whole Countreys. He over-runs
<hi>AEgypt</hi> with his armies of Frogs, and Flies, and Lice, and
before his own people with an armie of Hornets chases the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites</hi>
out of the Land. Nay, the dull and senseless elements,
are up in arms when God summons them. He shoots his Hail-shot;
with his Hail-stones from Heaven he destroyes more of
the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> then the <hi>Israelites</hi> can with their swords. As
for his armies of fire and water, what power is able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
them; every creature, when God calls, is a soldier.
How great then is the glory of this Kingdome of which the
meanest parts are invincible. Secondly, again our Saviour is a
King in a more restrain'd and confin'd sense, as he is in Heaven
attended on by Angels, and Arch-angels, powers, principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and all the heavenly hosts. For though he be omnipresent
and fills every place both in Heaven and Earth; yet Heaven is
the <hi>Palace</hi> and <hi>Throne</hi> of this <hi>Kingdome,</hi> there is he better seen and
known, there with more state and honour served, and therefore
more properly is his Kingdome said to be there. And this is
called his <hi>Kingdome of glory.</hi> The rules, and laws, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
orders of which Kingdome, could we come to see and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover,
it would be with us, as it was with the <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Saba,</hi> when
she came to visit <hi>Solomon,</hi> of whom the Scripture notes; that
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:114807:112"/>
when she heard his wisdome, and had seen the order of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
the attendance that was given him, and the manner of his
table. <hi>There was no more Spirit left in her.</hi> Beloved, <hi>Dum Spiritus
hos regit artus.</hi> Whilest this Spirit is in us, we cannot possibly
come to discern the laws and orders of this Kingdome, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I am constrained to be silent.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, our Saviour is a King in a sense, yet more impropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated.
For as he took our nature upon him, as he came into the
world to redeem mankinde, and to conquer Hell and death, so is
there a <hi>Kingdome</hi> annext unto him; <hi>A Kingdome,</hi> the purchase
whereof cost him much sweat and blood, of which neither An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels,
nor any other creature are a part, only that remnant of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde,
that <hi>Ereptus titio.</hi> That number of blessed <hi>Souls,</hi> which like
a brand out of the fire, by his death and passion he hath recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
out of the power of sin; and all these alone are the subjects
of that <hi>Kingdome.</hi> And this is that, which is called his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
of <hi>Grace,</hi> and which himself in Scripture every where calls
his <hi>Church,</hi> his <hi>Spouse,</hi> his Body, his <hi>Flock:</hi> and this is that <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi>
which in this place is spoken of, and of which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
tells <hi>Pilate. That it is not of this world; My Kingdome is not
of this world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which words at the first reading, may seem to savour of a
little imperfection; for they are nothing else but a <hi>Negation</hi> or
<hi>denial.</hi> Now our Books teach us, that a <hi>Negative</hi> makes nothing
known; for we know things by discovering not what they are
not, but what they are: yet when we have well examin'd them,
we shall finde that there could not have been a speech delivered
more effectual for the opening the nature of the Church, and the
discovery of mens errors in that respect. For I know no error
so common, so frequent, so hardly to be rooted out, so much hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the knowledg of the true nature of the Church, as this,
that men do take the Church to be like unto the world. <hi>Tully</hi>
tells us of a <hi>Musician,</hi> that being asked what the Soul was, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
that it was <hi>Harmonie, et is</hi> (saith he) <hi>à principiis artis suae
non recescit.</hi> He knew not how to leave the principles of his own
art.
Again <hi>Plato's</hi> Schollers had been altogether bred up in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmetick,
and the knowledge of numbers, and hence it came,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:114807:113"/>
that when afterward they diverted their studies to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Nature, or Moral Philosophy; wheresoever they walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they still feined to themselves some what like unto Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers:
the world they supposed was fram'd out of numbers, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and Kingdomes, and Common-wealths they thought stood
by numbers, Number with them, was sole principle and creator
of every thing. Beloved, when we come to learn the quality and
state of Christs Kingdome, it fares much with us, as it does with
<hi>Tullies Musician,</hi> or <hi>Plato's</hi> Schollers, <hi>difficulter à principiis artis
nostrae recedimus.</hi> Hardly can we forsake those principles, in which
we have been brought up. In the world we are born, in it we are
bred, the world is the greatest part of our studie, to the true
knowledge of God and of Christ, still we fancy unto us some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of the world. It may seem but a light thing that I shall say,
yet because it seems fitly to open my meaning, I will not refrain
to speak it: <hi>Lucian,</hi> when <hi>Priams young son</hi> was taken up into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
brings him in calling for milk and cheese, and such countrey
cates as he was wont to eat on earth. Beloved, when we first
come to the Table of God, to heavenly <hi>Manna</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> food,
it is much with us, as it was with <hi>Priams young son,</hi> when he came
first into Heaven, we cannot forget the milk and cheese, and the
gross diet of the world. Our Saviour and his blessed Apostles had
great and often experience of this error in men; when our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
preach't to <hi>Nicodemus</hi> the doctrine of regeneration, and new
birth, how doth he still harp upon a gross conceit of a re-entry
to be made into his mothers womb. When he preacht unto the
<hi>Samaritane women</hi> concerning the water of life, how hardly is she
driven from thinking of a material Elementary water, such as
was in <hi>Jacobs</hi> well. When <hi>Simon Magus</hi> in the <hi>Acts</hi> saw, that by
laying on of hands, the Apostles gave the Holy Ghost, he offers
them money to purchase himself the like power. He had been
trafficking, and merchandizing in the world, and saw what au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,
what a Kingdome money had amongst men: he
therefore presently conceited <hi>coelum venale Deumque:</hi> that
God and Heaven, and all would be had for money.
To teach therefore the young Courtier in the Court of Heaven
that he commit no such Solecisms, that hereafter he speak the true
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:114807:113"/>
Language, and dialect of God, our Saviour sets down this as a
principal rule in our Spiritual Grammar: That <hi>his Court</hi> is not
of this world; Nay, beloved not only the young Courtier, but
many of the old servants in the Court of Christ are stain'd with
this error. It is storied of <hi>Leonides</hi> which was School-master to
<hi>Alexander</hi> the great, that he infected his non-age with some vices,
<hi>quae robustum quoque &amp; jam maximum regem ab illa institutione puerili
sunt prosecuta,</hi> which followed him then, when he was at mans e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state.
Beloved the world hath been a long time a School-master
unto us, and hath stain'd our nonage with some of these spots
which appear in us, even then when we are strong men in Christ.
When our Saviour in the <hi>Acts</hi> after his Resurrection was discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to his Disciples concerning the kingdom of God, they present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
brake forth into this question, <hi>Wilt thou now restore the kingdom
unto Israel?</hi> Certainly this question betrays their ignorance, their
thoughts still ran upon a kingdom like unto the kingdoms of the
world, notwithstanding they had so long, and so often heard our
Saviour to the contrary, Our Saviour therefore shortly takes them
up; <hi>Non est vestrum,</hi> your question is nothing to the purpose; the
kingdom that I have spoken of is another manner of kingdom then
you conceive. Sixteen hundred years, <hi>Et quod Excurrit,</hi> hath the
Gospel been preached unto the world, &amp; is this stain spunged out
yet; I doubt it, whence arise those novel &amp; late disputes, <hi>de notis Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae,</hi>
of the notes &amp; visibility of the Church, Is it not from hence
that they of <hi>Rome</hi> take the world &amp; the Church to be like <hi>Mercury</hi>
and <hi>Sosia</hi> in <hi>Plautus</hi> his comaedies so like one another that one of
them must wear a toy in his cap, that so the spectators may distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish
them; whence comes it that they stand so much upon State
and Ceremony in the Church? Is it not from hence that they
think the Church must come in like <hi>Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Bernice</hi> in the
<hi>Acts,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> as S. <hi>Luke</hi> speaks with a great deal
of pompe, and train and shew, and vanity, and that the service of
God doth necessarily require this noise, and tumult of outward
State and Ceremony. Whence comes it that We are at our wits
ends, when we see persecution, and sword, and fire to rage against
the true professors of the Gospel? Is it not because, as these bring
ruine and desolation upon the kingdoms of the world; so we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:114807:114"/>
they work no other effect in the kingdom of Christ? all these
conceits and many more of the like nature spring out of no other
fountain, then that old inveterate error which is so hardly wiped
out of our hearts; that the State of the Church and Kingdom of
Christ doth hold some proportion? Some likeness with the state
and managing of temporal kingdoms; wherefore to pluck out of
our hearts, <hi>Opinionem tam insitam, tam vetustam,</hi> a conceit so ancient,
so deeply rooted in us, our Saviour spake most excellently, most
pertinently, and most fully when he tells us that his Church, that
his <hi>Kingdom is not of this world.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In which words of his, there is contained the true art of disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering
and knowing the true nature and essence of the Church.
For as they which make <hi>Statues,</hi> cut and pare away all superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the matter upon which they work, so our Saviour to shew
us the true proportion and feature of the Church, prunes away
the world and all superfluous excrescencies, and sends her to be
seen as he did our first Parents in Paradice, stark naked; As those
<hi>Elders</hi> in the <hi>Apocryphal</hi> story of <hi>Susanna,</hi> when they would see her
beauty, commanded to take of her mask: so he that longs to see
the beauty of the Church, must pull of that mask of the world &amp;
outward shew. For as <hi>Juda</hi> in the book of <hi>Genesis</hi> when <hi>Thamar</hi>
sate vail'd by the way side, knew not his daughter from an whore:
so whilst the Church, the daughter and spouse of Christ sits vail'd
with the world and pompe, and shew, it will be an hard matter to
discern her from an harlot; But yet further to make the difference
betwixt these kingdoms the more plainly to appear, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to fix it in your memories, I will briefly touch some of these
heads in which they are most notoriously differenced.</p>
                  <p>The first head wherein the difference is seen, are the persons
and <hi>subjects</hi> of this kingdom; For as the Kingdom of Christ is not
of this world, so the subjects of this Kingdom are men of another
world, and not of this: Every one of us bears a double person,
and accordingly is the subject of a double Kingdom. The holy
Ghost by the Psalmist divides heaven and earth betwixt God and
man, and tells us as for God, <hi>he is in heaven, but the earth hath he
given to the children of men:</hi> So hath the same spirit by the Apostle
Saint <hi>Paul</hi> divided every one of our persons into heaven and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:114807:114"/>
earth into an outward and <hi>earthly</hi> man, and into an inward and
<hi>heavenly</hi> man: This earth, that is, this body of clay hath he
given to the sons of men, to the Princes under whose go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
we live, but heaven that is the inward and spiritual
man hath he reserved unto himself; They can restrain the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man, and moderate our outward actions, by edicts and
laws, they can tie our hands and our tongues—<hi>Illa se jac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>et in aula
AEolus.</hi> Thus far they can go, and when they are gone thus far,
they can go no farther. But to rule the inward man in our hearts, &amp;
souls, to set up an Imperial throne in our understandings, &amp; wills,
this part of our government belongs to God &amp; to Christ; These
are the subjects, this the government of his Kingdom, men may be
Kings of Earth, &amp; bodies; But Christ alone is the King of Spirits
and Souls: Yet this inward government hath influence upon our
outward actions: For the Authority of Kings over our outward
man is not so absolute, but that it suffers a great restraint; It must
stretch no further then the Prince of our inward man pleases: for
if secular Princes stretch out the skirts of their Authority to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
ought by which our souls are prejudiced, the King of Souls
hath in this case given us a greater command, <hi>That we rather obey
God then men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second head wherein the difference betwixt these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
is seen is in their <hi>laws;</hi> For as the kingdoms &amp; the lawgivers
so are their laws very different: First, in their Authors, the laws
by which the Common-wealth of <hi>Rome</hi> was anciently govern'd,
were the works of many hands, some of them were <hi>Plebiscita</hi> the
the acts of the people, others were <hi>Senatus-consulta</hi> the decrees of
the Senate, others <hi>Edicta Praetorum,</hi> the verdict of their Judges, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
<hi>Responsa Prudentum</hi> the opinions of Wisemen in cases of
doubt. Others <hi>Rescripta Imperatorum,</hi> the Rescripts and answers
of their Emperors, when they were consulted with; But in the
kingdom of Christ there are no <hi>Plebiscita</hi> or <hi>Senatus-consulta,</hi> no
people, no Senate, nor wisemen, nor Judges, had any hand in the
laws by which it is governed. Only <hi>Rescripta Imperatoris</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts
and Writs of our King run here, these alone are the Laws
to which the Subjects of this Kingdom owe obedience. Again, the
Laws of both these kingdoms differ in regard of their quality and
nature; For the laws of the Kingdom of Christ are Eternal,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:114807:115"/>
Substantial, Indispensable, but Laws made by humane autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
are but light, superficial and temporary. For all the humane
authority in the world can never enact one eternal and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Law. Let all the Laws which men have made be laid to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and you shall see that they were made but upon occasion,
and circumstance either of time, or place, or persons in matters
of themselves indifferent, and therefore either by discontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
they either fell or ceased of themselves, or by reason of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
of occasion and circumstance were necessarily revoked;
Those main fundamental Laws upon which all the Kingdoms of
the world do stand, against theft, against murther, against adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
dishonouring of Parents or the like, they were never
brought forth by man, neither were they the effects of any Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary
Sessions; they were written in our souls from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
long before there was any authority Regal extant among
men. The intent of him who first enacted them was not to found
a temporal, but to bring men to an eternal Kingdom: and so far
forth as they are used for the maintaining of outward state they
are usurp'd, or at the best but borrowed, So that in this work
of setling even the Kingdoms of this world, if we compare
the Laws of God with the Laws of men we shall finde that God
hath as it were founded the palaces and castles, and strength of
them, but men have like little children built houses of clay, and
dirt which every blast of wind overturns.</p>
                  <p>The third head by which they may be seen is in the notes and
<hi>marks,</hi> by which they may be known: For the Kingdoms of the
world are confin'd, their place is known their subjects are discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
they have badges and tokens, and Arms by which they are
discovered; But the Church hath no such notes, and marks, no
Herauld hath as yet been sound that could blazon the arms of that
Kingdom. <hi>AEsculus</hi> the Poet in his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> describing
the captains, that came either for the siege or defence of the
City of <hi>Thebes in Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>tia</hi> brings them in, in their order every one
with his shield, and upon his shield some device, and over that
device a Motto or word according to the usual fancies of men in
that kinde; but when he comes to <hi>Amphiraus,</hi> he notes of him
that he had no device in his shield, no impress or word, and he
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:114807:115"/>
gives the reason of it; because he affected not shew, but to be
that which others profest. But to carry marks and notes and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
may well beseem the world which is led by fancy and
shew; but the Church is like <hi>Amphiarus,</hi> she hath no device, no
word in her shield, mark and essence with her are all one, and
she hath no other note but to be. And but that learned men must
have something to busie their wits withal these large discourses
<hi>de notis Ecclesiae,</hi> of the notes and marks by which we may know
the Church might very well lie by as containing nothing else
but <hi>doctas ineptias,</hi> Laborious vanities, and learned impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
For the Church is not a thing that can be pointed out: The
Devil <hi>could shew our Saviour Christ all the kingdoms of the earth and
the glory of them,</hi> I hope the Church was none of these; It is the
glory of it not to be seen, and the note of it to be invisible; when
we call any visible company of professors a Church it is but a
word of courtesie. Out of charity we hope men to be that which
they do profess, and therefore we so speak as if they were indeed
that, whose name they bear, where and who they are that make
up this kingdom, is a question unfit for any man to move: For the
Lord only knoweth who are his. It is but popish madness to send
men up and down the world to finde the Church; It is like unto
the <hi>Children of the Prophets</hi> in the second of <hi>Kings,</hi> that would
needs seek <hi>Elias</hi> or like the <hi>nobles in Hierusalem,</hi> that would needs
go seek <hi>Jeremie</hi> the Prophet, but could not finde him, because the
Lord had hid him: For in regard of the profession; The Church
(as our Saviour speaks) is like a City set upon an hill, you may
quickly see and know what true Christianity is, But in regard of
the persons the Kingdom of Heaven is, as our Saviour again tells
us like a <hi>treasure hidden in a field.</hi> Except the place of their abode,
and their persons were discernable, who can tell, we go thus to
seek them, whether we do not like false hounds <hi>hunt Counter</hi> (as
the hunters phrase is) and so go from the game, when <hi>Saul</hi> went
to seek his Fathers Asses, he found a Kingdom; Let us take heed
least the contrary befal us, least while we seek our Fathers
Kingdom thus, we finde but Asses. Will you know where to find
the Kingdom of Christ, our Saviour directs you in the Gospel,
<hi>The Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> saith he, cometh not by observation, <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:114807:116"/>
shall ye say, Lo here, or lo there, but the Kingdom of Heaven is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you:</hi> Let every man therefore retire into himself and see if he
can finde this kingdom in his heart; For if he finde it not
there, in vain shall he finde it in all the world besides.</p>
                  <p>The fourth head wherein the difference of these kingdoms is
seen is <hi>outward state</hi> and ceremony; for outward pompe and shew
is one of the greatest stays of the Kingdom of this world. Some
thing there must be to amaze the people, and strike them into
wonderment, or else Majesty would quickly be contemned. The
Scripture recounting unto us King <hi>Solomons</hi> Royalty tells us of his
Magnificent buildings, of his Royal throne, of his servants, and his
attendants, of his cup-bearers, of his meats, and these were the
things which purchased unto him, the reputation of Majesty, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all the Kings of the earth. Beloved, the Kingdom of Christ
is not like unto <hi>Solomon in his</hi> Royalty, It is like unto <hi>David</hi> when
he had <hi>put of</hi> all his Royalty, and in a linnen Ephod danced be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Ark: and this plain and natural simplicity of it, is like
unto the <hi>Lillies of the field,</hi> more glorious <hi>then Solomon in all his
Royalty.</hi> The Idolatrous superstitions of Paganism stood in great
need of such Pompous Solemnities, <hi>Ut opinionem suspendio cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis
aedificent, at<expan>
                           <am>
                              <g ref="char:abque"/>

praestruxerunt cupiditatem,</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> tells us; For being nothing
of themselves, they were to gain reputation of being something
by concealment, and by outward state make shew of something
answerable to the expectation they had raised: The case of the
kingdoms of the world is the same: For all this State and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificence
used in the Managing of them is nothing else but Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Idolatry, used to gain veneration, and reverence unto that
which in comparison of the Kingdom we speak of is meer vanity.
But the scepter of the Kingdome of Christ is a right scepter, and
to adde unto it outward state, and riches, and pomp, is nothing
else but to make a Centaure, marry and joyn the Kingdome of
Christ with the Kingdome of the world, which Christ expresly
here in my text hath divorced and put a sunder. A thing which I
do the rather note; because that the long continuance of some
ceremonies in the Church, have occasioned many especially of
the Church of Rome, to think that there is no religion, no ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:114807:116"/>
without these ceremonies, Our books tell us of a poor <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,</hi>
that travelling in another countrey, and seeing the beams
and posts of houses squared and carved, askt <hi>if the trees grew so in
those countreys?</hi> Beloved, many men that have been long acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with a form of worship, squared and carved, trick't and set
out with shew and ceremony, fall upon this <hi>Spartans</hi> conceit,
think the trees grow so, and think that there is no natural shape
and face of Gods service but that. I confess the service of God
hath evermore some ceremony attending it, and to our Fathers,
before Christ may seem to have been necessary, because God
commanded it: But let us not deceive our selves, for neither is
ceremony now, neither was sacrifice then esteemed necessary,
neither was the command of God concerning it, by those to
whom it was given, ever taken to be peremptory; I will begin
the warrant of what I have said out of St. <hi>Chysostome;</hi> for in his
comments upon the tenth of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> he denies that ever God
from the beginning requir'd, or that it was his will to ordain
such an outward form of worship; and asking therefore of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self

For because that men had a conceit, that if was convenient to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
up some part of their substance unto God, and so strongly
were they possest with this conceit, that if they offered it not up
to him, they would offer it up to Idols: God saith he, rather
then they should offer unto Idols, required them to offer unto
him. And thus was God understood by the holy men themselves,
who lived under the shadow of those ceremonies: for <hi>David</hi>
when he had made his peace with God, after that great sin of his
opens this mystery. <hi>For thou requirest not sacrifice,</hi> saith he, <hi>else

the rack, from the fire, from the sword, and what are they more then
other men. As <hi>Sampson</hi> tells <hi>Dalilah</hi> in the Book of the Judges, <hi>If my

like unto another man;</hi> so Beloved, these things are as it were the hair
wherein their strength lay, shave that away, and they shall presently
become weak, and like unto other men. But Temptations are of
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:114807:118"/>
two sorts: some are like profest and open Enemies, which proclaim
open war against us, like <hi>Goliah</hi> they publikely come forth and chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
us. And such are the outward Evils that befal us, Loss of Goods,
Sickness, Disease, Dishonor, Infamy, Persecutions, and the like.
Others there are of a more secret, close, and retired nature, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Traytors, that bear the behaviour and countenance of Friends;
that espy out their advantage and set privily upon us: the most
troublesome kinde of Enemies, <hi>per quos nec licet esse tanquam in
bello paratos, nec tanquam in pace securos:</hi> with whom we can have
neither peace nor war, and against whom we can neither be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
nor secure, these are our own corrupt Thoughts and Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
which secretly lye in our hearts, and watch their times to set
on us, as the Philistines did in <hi>Dalilahs</hi> chamber to surprize <hi>Sampson.</hi>
For let a man but descend into himself, examine his own soul, take
as it were an Inventory of the passions, affections, thoughts of his
own heart, look but what the number of them is, and let him make
accompt of so many enemies. <hi>Tot venena, quot ingenia; tot pernicies
quod &amp; species, tot dolores, quot colores;</hi> as <hi>Tertullian</hi> rimes it. A sort of
Enemies by so much the more dangerous, because that all those out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
enemies, of which I but now spake, cannot come so neer as to
rase our skin, or indanger one hair of our head, if these give them
not way: from these <hi>ut aspis a vipera venenum,</hi> as the Asp borrows
borrows poison from the Viper, do those other Temptations borrow
all their power and strength to hurt us. For let us take a survey of all
the outward afflictions, miseries and calamities, which have befallen
all the Saints of God in Holy Scripture, and let us suppose them to
be all set and bent against some one alone, yet notwithstanding, as the
<hi>three children</hi> in <hi>Daniel</hi> walkt in the midst of the fire untoucht, or as our
<hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>viour</hi> Christ pass'd away through the midst of the people, that were
gathered together to mischief him, and throw him down the Hill, so
shall he be able to pass from them all without any hurt or harm, if
some discontented, or distrustful, or despairing, or proud, or angry,
or impure and lustful thought do not betray him unto them, and as
it were open a door, and let them in. <hi>David</hi> who is here the subject
of my Text, had very much ado with both sorts of enemies, and by
his own experience found, that this latter rank of secret and privie
enemies in strength far surpassed the former. For whom neither the
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:114807:118"/>
Lion nor the Bear, nor <hi>Goliah,</hi> nor <hi>Saul,</hi> nor the Philistines could ever
fasten upon, or drive to any inconvenience, one lustful thought forced
to Adultery and Murder, one proud conceit stirred up to number the
people, and drew from God great inconveniences and plagues both
upon himself and his Kingdom. How careful then ought we to be,
and to stand on our guard, and keep a perpetual watch over our hearts,
diligently to try and examine our thoughts, <hi>Nunquam securo trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantur
otio, sed tantum sollicito premuntur imperio, August.</hi> Nor while
we live shall we be able perfectly to master, or securely to triumph
over them: the only way to suppress and keep them down is, to have
a perpetual and careful jealousie of them. Now of this Religious
care and watchfulness over our own thoughts, hath the Holy Ghost
recorded for our use a notable example in these words, which but now
I read, <hi>And it came to passe, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To relate unto you at large the occasion of these words, and the
story from whence they depend, were but to wrong you, for I cannot
think so meanly of your knowledg in Scripture, as that any of you
can be ignorant of so famous a passage. Yet thus much for the
better opening of my way unto such doctrines, as I shall draw from
this Text, I will call back unto your memories, that <hi>Saul</hi> hunting af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>David</hi> to kill him, unwittingly stept into a Cave where <hi>David</hi>
was; <hi>David</hi> having now his enemy in his hand, and opportunity to
revenge himself, lets slip all thought of revenging, and only cuts off
privily the lap of his Garment. For this deed so harmless so innocent
the Scripture tells us that his heart smote him, that he suffered great
anguish and remorse in Conscience for it. That which I will require
you to note, is the tenderness of Conscience, and strange scrupulous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in <hi>David</hi> for so small an action; for it will yield us a great Les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.
I say it appeareth not by Scripture, that <hi>David</hi> intended any mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
or treason to <hi>Saul,</hi> or that he harbour'd in heart any disloyal
thought against him. This purpose of cutting off the lap of <hi>Sauls</hi>
garment was no other then to purchase to himself a harmless and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
testimony of his Innocency, and to prove unto <hi>Saul,</hi> that
there was no likelihood that he sought his blood, whom he spared,
having him at so great an advantage. Yet notwithstanding, as if the
rending of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment, had been the wounding of <hi>Sauls</hi> body, or
the shedding of his blood, <hi>David</hi> stands amazed, and is affrighted at
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:114807:119"/>
so honourable, so innocent a thought. <hi>His heart smote him,</hi> saith the
Scripture. As men that have been at sea, and indanger'd through the
raging of windes, and tempests, and floods, when afterward the
weather is cleared up, the windes allayed, the seasmoothed, and all
calm, yet scarcely dare they set sail again, and trust to so uncertain,
so fickle an Element: so seems it to have fared with <hi>David</hi> in this
place. He was a man subject to the same passions with other men,
and doubtless, through the raging of unruly and misorderly affections,
he had many times been in danger of spiritual shipwrack; wherefore
<hi>licet in morem stagni fusum aequor arrideat,</hi> and though now he could dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
no tempest in his heart, though the face of his thoughts were as
smooth as glass; yet when he looks upon such fair and calm affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
his heart misgives him, and he dares not trust them: <hi>magnos hic
campus montes habet, tranquilitas ista tempestas est.</hi> The care he hath over
his own heart fills him with suspitions, and still he thinks, something
he knows not what, may be amiss. But I must come unto the words.
<hi>And it came to pass afterwards, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In these words we will consider these three things.</p>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. The Person, <hi>David, And Davids heart smote him.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Davids</hi> Sollicitousness, his care and jealousy, very signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly
expressed in the next words; <hi>His heart smote him.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. The cause of this his care and anxiety of minde in the
last words, <hi>Because he had cut off Sauls skirt.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
                  <p>In the first point, that is, in the <hi>Person,</hi> we may consider his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
he was a <hi>King</hi> in expectation, and already anoynted. A cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
by so much the more considerable, because that greatness
is commonly taken to be a Priviledge to sin: to be over carefull and
conscientious of our courses and actions are accounted virtues for pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<hi>Persons, Kings</hi> have greater businesses then to examine every
thought that comes into their hearts. <hi>Pater meus obliviscitur se esse
Caesarem; ego vero memini me Caesaris filiam.</hi> It is the answer of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia
Augustus</hi> the <hi>Emperour's</hi> daughter, when she was taxed for her too
wanton and licentious living, and counsel'd to conform herself to the
Sobriety and Gravity of her Father. <hi>My Father,</hi> saith she, <hi>forgets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to be Caesar the Emperour: but I remember myself to be Caesars daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
It was the speech of <hi>Enxius</hi> the <hi>Poet, Plebs in hoc Regi antest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

loco; licet lachrimari plebi, Regi honeste non licet:</hi> Private men in this
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:114807:119"/>
have a priviledge above <hi>Princes;</hi> but thus to do becomes not <hi>Princes:</hi>
and if at any time these sad and heavy hearted thoughts do supprize
them, they shall never want comforters to dispell them. When
<hi>Ahab</hi> was for sullnness fallen down upon his bed, because <hi>Naboth</hi>
would not yield him his Vineyard, <hi>Jezabell</hi> is presently at hand and
asks him, <hi>Art thou this day King of Israel?</hi> When <hi>Ammon</hi> pined a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
in the incestuous love of his Sister <hi>Thamar, Jonadab</hi> his companion
comes unto him, and asks, <hi>why is the Kings Son sad every day?</hi> so that,
as it seems great <hi>Persons</hi> can never be much or long sad. Yet <hi>David</hi>
forgets his greatness, forgets his many occasions, gives no ear to
his companions about him, but gives himself over to a scrupulous and
serious consideration of an Action in shew and countenance but light.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as the <hi>Person</hi> is great, so is the care and remorse
conceived upon the Consideration of his action exceeding great,
which is our Second part: And therefore the Holy Ghost expresses
it in very significant termes: <hi>His heart smote him,</hi> a phrase in scripture
used by the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> when men begin to be sensible and repent them
of some sin. When <hi>David</hi> had commited that great sin of numbring
the people, and began to be apprehensive of it, the Scripture tells
us that <hi>Davids</hi> heart smote him, when he had commanded <hi>Jeab</hi> to
number the People. Wherefore by this smiting we may not here
understand some light touch of Conscience, like a grain of powder
presently kindled and presently gone, for the most hard and flinty
hearts many times yield such sparks as these. He that is most flesht in
sin, commits it not without some remorse; for sin evermore leaves
some scruple, some sting, some lothsomness in the hearts of those
that are most inamour'd of it. But as <hi>Simeon</hi> tells the blessed Virgin
in St. <hi>Lukes</hi> Gospell, <hi>Gladius pertransihit animam tuam;</hi> a sword shall
peirce through thine heart; so it seems to have been with <hi>David.</hi>
It was not some light touch to rase only the surface and skin of the
heart, but like a sword it pierced deep into him. To teach us one lesson,
that actions spotted, though but with the least suspicion of sin, ought
nor carelesly to be past by, or slightly glanced at, but we ought to be
deeply apprehensive of them and bestow greatest care and considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
upon them.</p>
                  <p>The third part of our Text containeth the cause of <hi>Davids</hi> remorse
in the last words. Because he cut off <hi>Sauls</hi> skirt, in the two former
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:114807:120"/>
parts we had to do with greatness: there was 1. a great <hi>Person,</hi> and
2. great <hi>Remorse,</hi> can we in this third part find out any great cause
or reason of this, so to make all parts proportionable? Certainly he that
shall attentively read and weigh these first words of my Text, and
know the story, might think that <hi>David</hi> had committed some nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
error, as some great oppression, or some cruell slaughter, or some
such royall sin, which none but <hi>Kings</hi> and great men can commit. But
beloved this my Text seems to be like the <hi>Windows</hi> in <hi>Solomons Temple,</hi>
broad within, but narrow without: or like a <hi>Pyramide</hi> large and spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
at the Basis and ground of it, but small and sharp at the top.
The <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Remorse,</hi> which are the Ground and subject of my
Text both are great and large, but the cause which is the very crown
and top of all, that is very small, yea peradventure none at all.
For whether it be that my self accustomed to greater sins, and now
grown old in them, have lost all sense of small and petty errours, or
whether indeed there be no errour at all in this action of <hi>David,</hi> but
only some fancy, some jealousy arising out of that Godly and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
watch he kept over all his wayes, or whatsoever else it was that
caused this scruple or remorse in <hi>David,</hi> it is a very hard matter to
discover, and yet notwithstanding that we may make more open
pass unto such Doctrines as I shall raise out of these words, let us a
little scan and consider what it was in this action that made <hi>David</hi>
thus strangely scrupulous.</p>
                  <p>And first of all was it for that he had toucht and taken that which
was none of his own, and therefore might seem to fall within com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass
of the Law against injury and purloyning? This seems not proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:
for when afterwards in the like case he came upon <hi>Saul</hi> as he
was sleeping in the Camp, and took from him the Spere and the
pot of Water which stood at his head, we do not read that his heart
smote him, and yet he took what was none of his.</p>
                  <p>Or 2ly. was it that he did wrong and dishonour <hi>Saul</hi> in mangling
his garment? Indeed the <hi>Jews</hi> have a tradition that this was the sin
of which <hi>David</hi> was here so sensible. And therefore say they, whereas
we read in the first of <hi>Kings,</hi> that when <hi>David</hi> grew old they covered
him with clothes, but he gat no heat, this was the punishment of his
sin committed against <hi>Saul:</hi> God so providing that garments should
not be serviceable to him who had offended in wronging <hi>Sauls</hi> gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
But this I must let go as a fable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="179" facs="tcp:114807:120"/>Or 3ly. was it that he had unadvisedly given way to some disloyal
thought, and at first resolved to revenge himself on <hi>Saul,</hi> having him at
the advantage, though afterward he repented? Indeed St. <hi>Chrysostome</hi>
thinks so; and therefore on those words at the latter end of the verse
next before my Text, <hi>And David arose,</hi> he notes <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
See you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ot, saith he, what a tempest of rage and anger
begins to rise in him; for he supposeth him to arise in heat and fury,
with a resolution for blood: but it pleased God in the way, to
make him relent and change the purpose of revenge into the Action
of cutting off his skirt: and that this smiting of <hi>Davids</hi> heart was
nothing else but his repenting himself for giving over hasty entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to such a rebellious thought. But beloved, <hi>who shall lay any thing
to the charge of Gods elect? Davids</hi> thoughts were known only to <hi>God</hi>
and himself. Since therefore <hi>God</hi> gives not this as a reason of <hi>Davids</hi>
remorse, but another thing; far be it from me, that I should wrong
<hi>David</hi> so far, as to burden him with that, with which none but <hi>God</hi>
can charge him. I rather chuse to follow St. <hi>Basils</hi> rule: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
let the Scriptures be understood as they lye. The Scripture
tells us, <hi>Davids heart smote him,</hi> because he cut of the skirt of <hi>Sauls</hi>
garment, and not because he had conceiv'd against <hi>Saul</hi> any thought
of blood. But what cause then shall we give of <hi>Davids</hi> remorse, none
other, Beloved, but that Religious and carefull jealousie which still he
had over his own thoughts, which made him <hi>pietatis affectu etiam quae
tuta sunt formidare,</hi> Hieron. To suspect all things be they never so safe,
and never to think himself secure from the contagion of sin. It was
with <hi>David</hi> as it is wont to be with men that are often troubled with
sicknesses and diseases, <hi>suspicionibus inquietantur, medicisque jam sani
manum porrigunt, &amp; omnem calorem corporis sui calumniantur,</hi> Senec. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
themselves with every little alteration in their Bodies, repair

Ague fit. <hi>Horum corpus non est parum sanum, sed sanitati parum assuevit:</hi>
these men are not sick, but they do not know what it is to be in health.
In the same state is <hi>David,</hi> he had been often infected with Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
weakness and disease, and therefore he suspects every motion of his
heart, and takes every thought to be a temptation. <hi>Hujus animus non
erat parum sanus, sed sanitati parum assuevit,</hi> his Soul was not sick of any
sin, but he did not know what it was to be in Spirituall health.</p>

                     </gap>ly see and discerne smaller sins: or else as <hi>Hagar</hi> in the
Book of <hi>Genesis,</hi> laid <hi>Ismael</hi> afar off from her, that she might not be
griev'd with the sight of him: so we labour to lay our sins <hi>far</hi> out of
kenn, that the memory and sight of them might not exasperate and
trouble us. For the cure of both these infirmityes I have borrowed
out of the Lords treasury a Spectacle or <hi>Optick Glass,</hi> which if we use
it, will restore our decayed eyesight and quicken and make us read
our sins in the smallest print; and let them<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ly never so farr from us,
yet will it present them unto us in their true quantity and greatness.
Towards the better use of which Spirituall Glasse, one lesson would I
especially commend unto you; to be perpetually Jealous and suspicious
of your thoughts, and to be quick-sented, easily to trace the footing of
sin, to be easily sensible of it, when we think our selves to have done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miss: a
lesson naturally arising, as I take it, out of <hi>Davids</hi> example, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
unto us in this place. Now how absolutely behoofefull it is
for us to hold a perpetuall Watch over our hearts, and be jealous of
such thoughts as spring out of them it will appear by these Reasons.</p>
                  <p>First, because that sin is of such a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ly insinuating nature, that it will
privily creep in, and closely cleave to our thoughts and intents, though
we perceive it not. For as waters though of themselves most pure, will
relish and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>avour of the Earth and soyl through which they passe. So
thoughts in themselves good, passing through the corrupt and evill
ground of our hearts, cannot but receive some tincture, some dye,
some relish from them. When <hi>David</hi> had an intent to build <hi>God</hi> an
house, he doubtless conceived no otherwise of this his intent, then
of a religious and honourable purpose, and in outward appearance
there was no cause, why he should doubt of <hi>Gods</hi> acceptance yet we
see this purpose of his misliked by <hi>God,</hi> and rejected, and the reason
given, <hi>quia vir sanguinum es tu, because thou art a man of blood.</hi> How
sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ll we then secure our selves of any thought, if such an intent as
this, so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>avouring of Zeal, of Sanctification, of love unto the glory of
<hi>God,</hi> have such a flaw in it as makes it unprofitable; and how neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
is it that we bring all our immaginations and intents to the fire
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:114807:121"/>
and to the refining pot, so throughly to try them, &amp; bring them to their
highest point of purity &amp; perfection. Be it peradventure, that the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
be in it self good; if it be lyable to any suspicion of evill, it is enough
to blast it. It is the <hi>Holy Ghosts</hi> rule given by the blessed <hi>Apostle,</hi> that <hi>we
abstain from all shew and appearance of evill,</hi> that we refrain as much as
possible from all such actions, as are capable of misconstruction. What
is more lawfull, then for the labourer to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ave his hire, then for those
that labour in the <hi>Gospell,</hi> to live by the <hi>Gospell?</hi> Yet we see St. <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused
this Liberty, and chose rather to work with his own hands; only
for this reason, because he would not give occasion to any, that would
misinterpret his Action, to live at others cost &amp; feed on the sweat of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
brows. What befalls <hi>Princes</hi> many times and great <hi>Persons</hi> that
have abused their Authority, the people rise and suppress them, deface
their statues, forbid their coyn, put away all things that bear any me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of them: So seems our blessed <hi>Apostle</hi> to deal here<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>look what acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
they be which bear any inscription, any image &amp; title, any shew, or
spot of sin, these hath he thought good even to banish &amp; qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>e prohibit.
Our prophane stories tell us, that when <hi>Julius Caesar</hi> had divorc'd his
wife; being asked why he did so, since nothing was brought against her
to prove her dishonest, his answer was, that <hi>she that will be Wife of Caesar
must not only be free from dishonesty, but from all suspicion of it.</hi> Beloved, St.
<hi>Paul</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians</hi> that <hi>he had espoused them unto one Husband,
that he might deliver them as a chast Virgin unto Christ.</hi> And <hi>God</hi> every
where in Scripture compairs his Church unto an espoused wife, &amp; him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
unto an Husband, a Husband far more jealous then ever <hi>Caesar</hi> was.
How carefull then must that Soul be, that intends to Marry it self to
such a jealous Husband, to abstain not only from all pollution of sin, but
from all suspicion of it. Last of all it is <hi>Tertullians</hi> speech: <hi>Quanto facilius
illicita timebit, qui etiam licita verebitur.</hi> It is wisdom sometimes to sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
and shun things that are lawfull. For there are many actions in
themselves good which yet to many men become occasions of sin and
scandall. For it is with our Actions as it is with our meats &amp; drinks. As,
divers meats fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> not divers constitutions of Body; so all Actions accord
not well with all Tempers of mind. As therfore what Dish
it is we easily Surfeit of, though it be otherwise good it is
wisdome totally to abstain from: so look what actions they be
in which we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ind our selves prone to sin, it is good spirituall <hi>Physick</hi> to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:114807:122"/>
use abstinence &amp; quite to leave them. For if our <hi>Savior</hi> command us to
<hi>pluck out our eyes, and pare off our hands,</hi> if once they become unto us cause
of sin, how much more then must we prune away all inward thoughts,
all outward circumstances, which become occasion of offence unto us.</p>
                  <p>A 2d. reason, why I would perswade you to entertain a jealousie
of all your thoughts and actions, is a naturall overcharitable affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which I see to be in most men unto their own wayes, and which
is st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ange; the worse they are, the more are we naturally enclined to
favour them. The Reason is because the worse they are, the more
they are our own. When question was sometime made, <hi>Why good
hearbs grow so sparingly, and with great labour and pains, where as weeds
grow apace without any culture and tilling;</hi> it is was answered, that the
earth was a <hi>naturall Mother</hi> to the one, to the other she was a <hi>Step-Mother;</hi>
the one she brought forth of her self, to the other she was
constrain'd. Beloved, it is with our hearts as it is with the Earth, the
naturall fruit of them is weeds and evill thoughts, unto them our
hearts are as mothers, <hi>injusta virescunt,</hi> they spring up in us of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
without any care or manuring: but as for good thoughts if they
be found in our hearts, they are not naturall, they are set there by a
high hand, they are there by a kind of spirituall inoculation and graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
as men graffe <hi>Apples</hi> and kind fruits upon Thornes and Crabs.
No mervail then, if like choice herbs and fruits they grow so tenderly,
and need so much care and cherishing. As therefore <hi>Parents,</hi> though
their own children be very deformed, yet love them more then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
though more beautifull: so corrupt and evill thoughts are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally
dearer unto us then good, because we are as Mothers unto
them, to the rest we are but Stepdames. Two notable Fruits there
are of this overcharitableness to our own actions. First a willingness
that we have to flatter, to deceive and abuse our own selves by
pretences and excuses. There is a plain, a downright, and as it
were a Countrey reprobate, one that sees his sin and cares not much
to excuse it, and is content to go on, and as it were in simplicity to cast
himself away. There is a more witty, more refined, and as it
were a Gentlemanlike reprobate, one that strives to smooth and
guild over his sin, to deceive others and himself with excuses and
apologies, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
as <hi>St. Basil</hi> speaks, to take great pains, and with the expense of a
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:114807:122"/>
great deal of wit and art to damn himself. When <hi>Saul,</hi> being sent
against <hi>Amalek,</hi> had spared <hi>Agag</hi> and the best and fattest of the prey,
at <hi>Samuels</hi> coming to visit him, how doth he wipe his mouth, as
if all had been well, and trimly composes himself to entertain him,
<hi>Blessed art thou of the Lord, I have performed the commandment of the
Lord.</hi> And when <hi>Samuell</hi> had shewed him his errour, how quickly
hath He his excuse at his fingers ends: <hi>We have spared the best of the
Sheep and of the Oxen to Sacrifice unto the Lord, Et Deo adulatur &amp; sibi
lenocinatur,</hi> as <hi>Tertulian</hi> speakes, he thinks to gull Almighty God
with fair and flattering pretences, and becomes a baud to his own vice,
<hi>nimium idem omnes fallimur,</hi> it is the common errour of us all, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>nd
in most of our Actions we do as <hi>Saul</hi> did, endeavour to put tricks
upon our selves. Beloved, were we not partiall, but rigid censurers
of our own thoughts, this corrupt fruit would quickly rot and fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.
Again their is a 2d. fruit springing out of this favour and dotage
on our own actions, an errour as common though, not so dangerous,
for we are content many times to acknowledg that something
is amiss in our actions, we will confess them to be sins, but we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>t
of them as little sins, sins of a lesser size, not so fearfull, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily
pardonable. There is a sinner who by committing some great and
and heinous crime (<hi>crimen devoratorium salutis,</hi> as <hi>Tertulian</hi> calls it,
such a sin as with open mouth devours salvation) doth as it were
with one step leap into Hell? and of this kind of sinners the number is
fewer. But abundance there are, who avoiding great and heinous
sins, by committing lesser sins, as they think, can be content to go
by degrees and as it were step by step into Hell. Beloved let us a
little put on the spectacle I but now spake of, that we may see whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any sin be so small, as we take it. I know there is difference of
sins. Our Saviour tells us that there is a beam and there is a more:
but withall this I know, that the best way to keep us from sin, is <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nima
pro maximis cavere,</hi> to loath even the least, as if it were the
greatest; if we look through this Glass it will make us think every
more a beam. Sins in themselves are unequall, but in regard of us
and of our endeavour to avoid them, they are all equall. <hi>Fly from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,</hi>
saith the <hi>Psalmist:</hi> he tells us not, that there is one greater evill
from which we must <hi>fly,</hi> and another less from which tis enough if we
do but <hi>go:</hi> but he bids us fly, and to make haste alike from all. To
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:114807:123"/>
think that a sin is less then it is, may be dangerous for it makes us the
less carefull to avoid it: but to mistake on the other hand, and think a
sin greater then it is, this is a very profitable errour. <hi>Utinam sic sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
erraremus;</hi> would God we did alwaies thus erre; for besides that
there is no danger in it, it makes us more fearfull to commit sin. Our
Saviour reprehends the Pharisees in the Gospell because they could
strain at <hi>gnats</hi> but swallow <hi>Camells,</hi> but yet it is true, that men
learne at length to swallow <hi>Camells</hi> by swallowing <hi>Gnats</hi> at first. <hi>Nemo
repente fuit turpissimus,</hi> no sinner so hardy as to set upon the greatest
sins at first. The way by which men train up themselves to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
gross and heinous sins, is by not being at first conscientious
of lesser sins, <hi>Et sane nescio,</hi> saith <hi>Paulinus</hi> in St. <hi>Hierom, an possimus
leve aliquod peccatum dicere quod in Dei contemptum admittitur:</hi> who
dares call any sin little, that is committed against God; small con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
against great Princes are accounted great oversights; for
what is wanting in the thing is made up in the worth of the Person.
How great a sin then is the smallest contempt that is done against
God? <hi>Prudentissimus ille est, qui non tam considerat quid jussum sit,
quam illum, qui jusserit; nec quantitatem imperii, sed imperantis cogitat
dignitatem.</hi> It is the best wisdome for us, not so much to consider, what
is commanded, as who it is that commandeth it; to consider, I say,
not the smallness of the Law, but the greatness of the Lawgiver. Sins
comparatively may be counted greater or lesser, but absolutely none
can be counted small. To conclude then this point; <hi>Charity suspecteth
no harm</hi> saith St. <hi>Paul:</hi> true, but we must note, that some vertues in us
concern our selves, as <hi>Faith, Hope, Temperance,</hi> and the like: some
vertues concern not our selves, but others; but such an one is <hi>Charity.</hi>
Charity that wills Christians to think well of all others, can have little
room upon our selves. Let us then make use of this Charity towards
our Neighbours; hope the best of all their actions; but let us take
heed how we be overcharitably minded to our selves. <hi>Caesar</hi> profest,
that he would <hi>rather dy then, suspect his friends;</hi> and he sped accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly:
for he dyed by the treachery of those Friends whom he suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
not: Let us take heed how we be overkind unto our own thoughts
how we think it an errour to be two suspicious of them. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> :
peradventure those Sons of our own hearts whom we least suspect,
will in the end prove those who shall betray us. But I come to a third
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:114807:123"/>
Reason. A third reason why I shall advise you to this jealousy over
your own thoughts, is the difficulty of discovering them betime, and
ing of what spirit they are. For our heart is like that Field in the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell,</hi>
in which the <hi>Husbandman sowes good Corne, and the enemy sowes
tares. God</hi> infuseth good thoughts, and the Devill ill. Now as weeds
many times at their first budding are hardly known from good hearbs;
so at the first springing and budding of our thoughts a hard mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it is, to know the weed from the good hearb, the Corne from
the tare. As <hi>Judah</hi> in the Book of <hi>Genesis, knew not Tamar,</hi> till the
fruit of his sin committed with her began to shew it self: so till the
fruits of our thoughts and purposes begin to appear, except we search
very narrowly, we can scarcely discover of what rank they are. <hi>Tunc
ferrum quod latebat in fundo supernatabat aquae, &amp; inter palmarum arbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
myrrhae amaritudo reperta est.</hi> Then the iron that lay in the bottom,
will swim at the top of the water, and among the pleasant <hi>Palmtrees</hi>
will be found the bitterness of mirrh. We read in the 2d. of <hi>Samuell</hi>
that when the Arke was brought from <hi>Kirithjearim,</hi> the Oxen that
drew the cart shook it, and <hi>Uzzah</hi> reaching out his hand to save it
from falling, for his good service was laid dead in the place. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<hi>Uzzah</hi> his accompanying the Ark was a sign of his love unto it:
his love unto it begat in him a fear to see it in danger: his fear to see
it in danger bred in him a desire to keep it from danger. See beloved,
what a number of <hi>Golden thoughts</hi> are here: yet as we read in the
book of <hi>Job,</hi> when the <hi>servants of God came and stood before him, Satan
also came and stood amongst them:</hi> So in this <hi>chorus</hi> and quire of these
Angelicall thoughts the Devill finds a place to rest himself in. For
this desire of <hi>Uzzah</hi> to save the Ark from danger, made him forget
what was written, <hi>that none should touch the Ark save only the Priests:</hi> the
breach of which precept brought that fearfull judgment upon him.
You see Beloved that though the course of our thoughts be like <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobs
Ladder,</hi> and God himself be at one end of them, yet Satan, if he
can, will be the other. Let us learn by this example of <hi>Uzzah,</hi> betimes
to discover our thoughts, and not to suffer them to grow till their fruit
betray them. Indeed our <hi>Saviour</hi> hath given us a rule, <hi>You shall know
them by their fruits;</hi> but we must take heed that we extend not this
rule to far. <hi>Uzzah</hi> felt the fruit of his thoughts to his own cost. It is
never good trying conclusions there, <hi>Ubi paena statim sequitur errorem.</hi>
                     <pb n="186" facs="tcp:114807:124"/>
Let us learn to decipher our thoughts then, when we may do it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
danger, whilst they are in <hi>semine</hi> whilst they are yet but budding
and peeping above ground, <hi>done<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap> Sarculo tantum opus est, non Securi,</hi>
whilst yet there is only need of the weedhook, and not of the hatchet.</p>
                  <p>A fourth reason yet there is, for which I would counsel you to hold
a strict hand over your thoughts, and it is, because that from outward
sins we can better preserve our selves, then from our sins in thought.
Beloved, there is a <hi>transeunt</hi> sin, and there is an <hi>imminent</hi> sin, there is
a sin that is outwardly acted by the service of the body; there is a sin
that requires not the help of the body, but is committed inwardly in
the very thought and Soul, a speculative or an intellectual sin. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
sins are many wayes pass'd by, means may be wanting, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
may hinder, time and place may be inconvenient; but for spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
sins, or sins in thought, all times, all occasions, all places
are alike: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> saith Saint. <hi>Basil:</hi> A
man, saith he, of great gravity and countenance sits in the midst of
the market-place, with many hundreds about him, and looking upon
him, yet notwithstanding this man, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> even this man in the
middest of all the company fancies to himself what he desires,
and in his imaginations goes unto the place of sin, or rather retires
into his own heart, and there he findes place and means to commit
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> a sin that hath no witness but God. If we retire
to our <hi>private Chambers,</hi> these sins will follow us thither, and as <hi>Baa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nab</hi>
and <hi>Richab</hi> did by <hi>Isboseth Sauls</hi> son, they will finde us out upon
our beds, and slay us there. If we go to the <hi>Church,</hi> they will finde
us out there, and as <hi>Adramelech</hi> and <hi>Sharezer</hi> slew <hi>Sennacherib</hi> whilst
he was worshipping his God; they will set upon us even in the midst
of our holyest meditations and prayers: neither Chamber nor Church,
no place so private, none so holy, that can give us Sanctuary, or shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
us from them. S. <hi>Hierom</hi> confesses thus much of himself, that
when he had forsaken the world, all outward occasions of sin, and
gone into the Desart, and shut himself up in a poor Cell, and mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
his body <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> with watchings, with fastings,
and perpetual prayers and religious exercise, yet could he not be se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
from them. <hi>Pallebant orajejuniis, &amp; mens desideriis aestuabat in
frigido corpore:</hi> his body was now grown pale, and meager, and cold,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:114807:124"/>
but yet his heart burnt with unlawful desires. Again they are sins of
quick and easy dispatch, they are done <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
as S. <hi>Basil</hi> notes; in a moment of time, without labour of body, without
care of minde: One wanton look makes us guilty of Adultery, one
angry conceit guilty of Murder, one covetous conceit guilty of Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery.
Whatsoever is outwardly committed either with difficulty of
circumstance, or labour of body, or danger of Law, that is inwardly
committed in the soul without any trouble at all: Thirdly consider
but the strength of your thoughts, and you will see there is great
reason to keep them low; for there was no man yet that ever was foil'd
but by them, and not by the outward acting of sin. For the outward
action is but the <hi>Cortex,</hi> the bark of the sin: but the very body and
substance of sin is the wicked thought. <hi>Beware of men,</hi> saith our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
when he gave his Apostles counsel how to provide for their safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in times of outward danger: but if we will provide against inward
dangers, we shall not need to beware of men, or of any outward
force whatsoever. Let every man beware of himself, for in this case
every man is his own greatest enemy. To draw then to a conclusion:
That sins of thoughts prevail not against us, our way is by a jealous
care first to prevent them; and to this hath the greatest part of my
discourse hitherto tended. Secondly if we have suffered them to gain
a little ground upon us, let us betimes take the rains into our own
hands and pull them back again, and cast out our Adversary, whilst
he is yet weak. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> saith
S. <hi>Chrisoft.</hi> such are the souls of holy men: their recovery is so quick,
that they may seem to have risen before they fell. It is a great signe
of spiritual life in us to be quickly sensible of the first track and foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of sin. For as bodies of the best and purest complexion have their
senses quickest; so that soul which soonest perceives the first sent of
sin, is of the Divinest temper. Our books tell us, that <hi>Dionysius</hi> the

not; the harm is, if by consent, though never so little, you stay upon

                     <p>MAy it please your Honor: Wee arrived at <hi>Dort</hi> this last night
betwixt six and seven of the clock; our passage was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any impediment at all, and wheresoever we were to
take boat still we found some ready to put off, as if they
had waited our coming. Immediately upon my arrivall I
went to My Lord Bishop, and assoon as I had done my message unto
him, I forthwith went to <hi>Monsieur Bogermannus,</hi> who humbly thanks
your Honour for your great courtesie towards him, and promises to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
your Lordship by me with whatsoever passes in the Synod: had
he known of so convenient meanes of writing to your Lordship, I suppose
he would have written: but when I spake with him I knew not so much
my self. <hi>Festus Hommius</hi> and <hi>Polyander</hi> I have not yet seen, and it will be
the afternoon ere I shall speak with them, because this morning they
have a sitting. Whatsoever hath past in the Synod formerly, your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
shall understand by a packet from my Lord Bishop; whatsoever spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
or other passages are to be copyed I shall this afternoon get of Mr.
<hi>President,</hi> and I will not fail to send your Honour the transcripts of them,
when <hi>Daniel</hi> returns. What shall be disputed of or decided in the next
Sessions at the Synod I will at large inform your Lordship by the next
messenger, mean time I humbly take my leave.</p>

Synod since the beginning, till the 16/26. of this present. It is not that
which I required, but is so much as <hi>Festus Hommius</hi> (whose writing it is)
could spare your Lorpship. My desire was to obtain not only the bare
conclusions, but the whole manner of proceeding, with all particulars
propounded and concluded in the Synod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> but it seems this was thought
<hi>nimis grande postulatum.</hi> If I can come so far to persit my notes of all the
former sessions, as that <hi>I</hi> shall be able to expresse them in form as I did
the session on Saterday last, and by Gods help will express the following
sessions, I will in time acquaint your Lordship with it. Mean while I come
to the session on Monday morning, the 16/26. of this present.</p>
                     <p>It had been in some of the Former sessions determined that there
should be chosen six Divines for the <hi>Translation of the Bible,</hi> three for the
Old Testament, and three for the New with the <hi>Apocrypha:</hi> and likewise
Revisors, one out of every Province, to whom the work being done should
be brought to be revised and censur'd. In this present Session they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to the choice of them. The manner of election was by <hi>Scrutiny:</hi>
the Deputies of every Province in <hi>Scripta</hi> exhibiting one. The S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>rutators
were two of the Seculars, <hi>D. Simon Schottus,</hi> Secretary of Middleburrough,
and President this week, and <hi>Martinus Gregorii,</hi> these calculated the
voices and pronounced the election. And first for the translation of the
Old Testament were chosen these three, <hi>Ioh. Bogermannus, Guil. Baudari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi>
and <hi>Gerson Bucerus:</hi> for the translation of the New, were chosen
<hi>Iac. Rolandus, Hermannus Fauckelius,</hi> and <hi>Petrus Cornelii.</hi> From these
they proceed to the nomination of the revisors. Here arose a doubt
concerning the province of <hi>Utrecht.</hi> For because they are equally divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
three Contra-Remonstrants, and three Remonstrants, they could not
agree upon the nomination of a Revisor for that Province, which thing
bred a demurre in the Synod. The <hi>Praeses</hi> required the judgment of the
Synod, what they thought fit to be done. Some thought they might be
altogether past by. For there would be Revisors enough, though that
Province chose none. Others thought fit it should be deferr'd till the end
of the Synod, and then some one of that Province should be chosen <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munibus
suffragiis totius Synodi.</hi> A third sort de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ermined that it should be
defer'd till that Province were reconciled in it self, (which it was hoped
would be at the end of the Synod) and then they should name some
one of their Province to be approved by the rest of the Translators and
Revisors; and this sentence past for currant. So that for the present there
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114807:126"/>
is no Revisor for the Province of <hi>Utrecht.</hi> Another doubt yet was moved,
for one of the Provinces, had named two <hi>paribus suffragiis:</hi> the question
was who should stand. It pleased the Synod to put it to Lots. And so the
<hi>Praeses</hi> wrote their names in two little Tickets of paper, each by it self, and
rould them up, and deliverd them to <hi>Martinius Gregorius;</hi> that which he
took, stood, that which he refused, was presently torne. The <hi>Revisors</hi> for
the <hi>Old</hi> Testament were these, <hi>ex Geldria Ant. Tysius; ex Suyd-Hollandia
Io. Polyander: ex North-Holl. P. Plancius, ex Zelandia Iod. Larenus: ex
Frisia Sibrandus Lubbertus: ex Transisulania Iac. Revius: ex Groning.
D. Gomarus: ex Drentia Onias Boethus.</hi> The Revisors for the <hi>New</hi> Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were these, <hi>Ex Geldria Seb. Dammannus: ex Suyd-Holl. Festus
Hommius; ex Northoll. Goswinus Geldorpius: ex Zelandia Ant. Walaeus, ex
Frisia Bern. Fullenius, ex Transisulania Jo. Langius, ex Groning. Ubbo
Emmius, ex Drentia Jo. Cuperus.</hi> It was farther enacted, that if any of
the Translators should die, or by Sickness became unable for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
that then he that was next him in number of voices in the Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny
should succeed in his place: If any of the Revisors should die, or
be sick, power was given to the <hi>Praeses,</hi> the two Assessors, and the two
Scribes to depute another in his roome: and so this Session concluded;
<q>
                           <hi>in which though little was done, yet was it long adoing, by reason of the
Scrutiny.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Upon Tuesday the 17/27 of this present, the Deputies met in the
morning, where the first thing that was proposed was concerning those
of <hi>Drent.</hi> For whereas the day before they had named two Revisors
for the Translation, they now upon better advice require to be excused
in that behalf, because in their Province the Belgick Tongue was not
well known. Which Petition of theirs was accepted. In the second
place it was thought good, that since all the business concerning the
Translation was determined of, there should be a repetition made in
the Synod of all that had pass'd about it: to this purpose, that if any
thing were either omitted or misrelated, it might be rectified: forthwith
followed a Narration of all that had been done, where some small ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
not worth relating were stood upon. In the third place was
proposed the defect of the <hi>Afternoon Sermons</hi> and <hi>Catechizing,</hi> especially
in the Countrey Villages; and the Synod was moved to deliver it self
concerning Remedies of this Defect. What had been heretofore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
in some of their Synods concerning this matter was publickly
read. The Impediments were, First the negligence of the Pastors; Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly
Combinations, that is double Benefices, when men having two
Cures could not sufficiently attend both: Thirdly the difficulty or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming
the Country people on the Sundayes either from the Sports,
or from their Work. The Synod beginning to consider of means to cut
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114807:127"/>
off these abuses, <hi>Festus Hommius</hi> amongst other things complain'd that
through the negligence of the Remonstrants, it came that Catechizing
was so much decay'd; which words of his, it is thought, will be an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion
of some choler, though for the present they pass'd uncontroll'd.
Many delivered their opinions how the forementioned hinderances of
Afternoon Sermons and Catechizing might be removed. First by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring
the help of the States General, that it would please them by
their Authority to prohibit that ordinary prophanation of the Sabbath
by working or playing: Secondly by requiring the like help of the
particular Magistrate in every Town and Village: Thirdly by taking
away those Combinations: Fourthly by providing of sufficient Schole-Masters
in every Village, who should not only teach Grammar, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct
Youths in the principles of Religion: Fifthly that the Pastors
should not omit afternoon Sermons by reason of the negligence of their
Auditors, but should perform them, though they brought to the Church
none but their own Family: that the Pastors and Deacons and Seniors
should deal with their Friends and Acquaintance and bring them to
Church with them. Sixthly that if any Pastor neglected to perform
this Duty, he should be subject to Ecclesiastical Censure. Seventhly that
the Deputies of other Nations should be requested to make overture of
their Customs in this behalf. Lastly that diligent enquiry should be
made throughout all the <hi>Classes,</hi> whether Catechizing and Afternoon
Sermons were observed. It was decreed that in every Parish there should
be two Sermons every Sunday, of which that in the Afternoon was to be
Catechetical. That the Ministers should give good example by bringing
their own Family to Church; that the help of the Magistrate should
be implored; that Combinations should be taken away. When all was
done, then was that requir'd which should have been done afore: the
Deputies of other Nations were desired to deliver their Customs in this
behalf. Where first my Lord Bishop shewed that with us in <hi>England</hi> the
Magistrate imposed a pecuniary Mulct upon such as did absent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
from divine duties; which pecuniary Mulct generally prevail'd
more with our people, then any pious admonitions could. Those of the
<hi>Palsgrave</hi>'s Countrey shewed that each Sunday they had two Sermons,
and such as were absent, were first admonish't by the Clergie, and if this
sufficed not, they required the help of the Civil Magistrate. Those of
<hi>Geneva</hi> told us, that in the Churches in their Cities they had every
Sunday four Sermons, &amp;c. Those of <hi>Breme</hi> that they had three Sermons,
of which one was Catechetical; and to avoid prophanation of the
Sabbath, it was not lawful to celebrate any Marriage-feast, or such like
upon the Sunday, till six a clock in the Evening. Many other things of
this nature were related, of which a great deal I could not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114807:127"/>
When all had spoken, the <hi>Praeses</hi> told them that this proposal was
not made because in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches there had not been order
taken for Catechizing and Sermons, but because the Laws formerly
made in this behalf were neglected: and that now means was thought
of to bring them in force again. And so they brake up.</p>
                     <p>I received your Honors Letters of the 16/26 of this present, in which your
Honour requires to be informed of such Proposals as <hi>Episcopius</hi> lately
madein behalf of the <hi>Arminian</hi> Party. The thing is this. Shortly after
that the Letters of Citation were sent to the <hi>Arminians, Episcopius</hi> with
other of the Remonstrants came privately to the Deputies of the States,
and exhibited a Remonstrance, in which they required especially these
things. First that all of their Party throughout the Provinces might
be allowed to make one Body, and out of it depute such as they
thought good, whom they might send to the Synod to plead in their
behalf. Secondly that it might be lawful for them instead of some of
those who are written unto, to substitute others. Thirdly that <hi>Utenbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gart</hi>
and <hi>Grevinchovius</hi> might have safe Conduct and free access to the
Synod. The Delegates immediately sent for the <hi>Praeses,</hi> the two <hi>Assessors</hi>
and the two <hi>Scribes,</hi> and required their opinion in this business. For the
first point, the Clergie men thought it not to be granted, as being fear'd
would be prejudicial to the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches. The Deputies for the
Seculars answered, that they had given <hi>Episcopius</hi> this answer. For the
two later, the Clergie thought that if it pleas'd the Seculars it might be
done. Reply was made by the Seculars, that they were men infamous,
tumultuous, on whom the Church censure, for <hi>Grevinchovius</hi> had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
and therefore they would permit them no place in the Synod.
So was <hi>Episcopius</hi> and his Company dismiss'd. <q>This was a thing <hi>done
only in private:</hi> the Synod had no notice of it, neither is it recorded
in any publick Register. What more pass'd between the Seculars and
the Remonstrants at this meeting is not known, and <hi>the Clergie know
no more then it pleased the Seculars to impart.</hi> Of this I heard nothing,
till by reason of your Lordships Letters I enquired into it.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whilst the Synod was sitting on Tuesday morning, there came in
Newes of the death of one of their Company, <hi>Henricus ab Hell,</hi> Senior
of the Church of <hi>Zutphaw,</hi> who died in the time of the Session. I am
desirous to know whether my Letters upon Munday containing the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday</hi>
Session came to your Lordships hands. I intended them by way
of <hi>Roterdam,</hi> but <hi>Daniel</hi> tells me he delivered them to a Gentleman
that went immediately for the <hi>Hague,</hi> marie what he was he knew not,
this hath made me a little jealous. I beseech your Honour, by the next
that comes from you hither, by word of mouth to let me know. Mr <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
Festus Hommius, Polyander, Tronchinus</hi> of <hi>Geneva</hi> requir'd me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member

their Love and service to your Honour: and so for this time
I humbly take my leave.</p>

                     <p>UPon Saterday, the day after my coming to <hi>Dort,</hi> I went to <hi>Festus
Hommius,</hi> and delivered him your Honours Letters, upon perusal
of which, he liberally promised me an <hi>Index</hi> of all whatsoever had past
in the Synod until my coming to town. The time of making his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
good was Sunday morning. When I saw it came not at the time,
after dinner I wrote a little note unto him, to put him in minde of his
promise, but yet I heard nothing of him. I suppose this falls out by
reason of his multiplicity of business, not that he would sleight your
Lordship; though I remember in the speech that pass'd between him and
me, he told me that their pass'd among the brethren of the Synod a
consent <hi>de non eliminandis, &amp;c.</hi> of not divulging of any passage till all
was done, which I interpreted as spoken only upon the by, not with any
intent of hindring any intelligence which should be given your Honour.
I dealt with Mr. <hi>Praeses</hi> and with <hi>Festus</hi> for a Copie of <hi>Martinus Gregorii</hi>
his oration: the answer from them both was the same, that he would
not at any hand be intreated to deliver a Copie of it, no not so much as
the summe of it: whether it was because of some matter that was in it,
as that he spake somewhat roundly in disgrace of the <hi>Spanyard,</hi> or that
the Politicks have some end in it, or that he himself is desirous to have
it thought that he delivered it only <hi>ex tempore,</hi> or for what other reason
I know not. As concerning what hath pass'd in the Synod, till I hear
farther from <hi>Festus,</hi> I will acquaint your Honour with what past there
since my coming.</p>
                     <p>On Saterday the 14/24 of this present, in the Morning the Deputies met,
<hi>and debated some things of no great moment,</hi> concerning their intended
<hi>TRANSLATION of the BIBLE.</hi> The first thing proposed was, whether
the name JEHOVAH should be retain'd untranslated, or rendred by
the Dutch word <hi>Heere,</hi> as the Greeks <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> the English <hi>Lord.</hi> The
<hi>Praeses</hi> thought sit it should be rendred <hi>Heere,</hi> because the Holy Ghost in
the New Testament, citing some things out of the Old, renders the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
<hi>Jehovah,</hi> by the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> according as the Septuagint had
done. This past for currant, till it came to <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>rtinius</hi> of <hi>Breme,</hi> who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
the sentence, and thought that it might ordinarily so be rendred,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114807:128"/>
if some places were excepted. And to this purpose he cited some places
of Scripture, where the word <hi>Jehovah</hi> had a peculiar energie and force,
which the Belgick <hi>Heere</hi> could not attain unto. To the same effect did
others speak: and great disputation would have arisen about this point,
as whether the Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> had any points of its own, or borrowed
his points from <hi>Elohim</hi> and <hi>Adonai,</hi> and the like, but that the <hi>Praeses</hi>
still cut them off. It was at length by the greater part concluded, that it
should be rendred by the Belgick <hi>Heere,</hi> which was alwayes to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
in Capital Characters, and concerning this the Reader should be
advertised farther in the Preface. And when there should be in any
place some peculiar force in that word, which the Belgick word did not
express, of this the Reader should be admonished by a <hi>marginal gloss.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second Proposal was, whether the <hi>Hebrew proper Names,</hi> should
be retained, or translated likewise into Dutch. It was concluded they
should be retain'd, for avoiding of all unnecessary novelty and altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The third proposal was, whether the <hi>ancient Division of Chapters</hi>
should remain, for many Hebrew Copies differ'd from our Common in
this point, and sometime the old division did seem somewhat incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient,
as that somewhere it brake off in the middest of a matter, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
in the middest of a sentence. It was concluded that the old di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
should remain. For there would arise great confusion in quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
if the number of Chapters and Verses should alter. As for the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of other Copies, and inconvenient division, of this the Reader
should be advertised <hi>in the Margent.</hi> The fourth proposal was, whether
there might not be added some <hi>Appendices</hi> to the Bible, as <hi>Chorographical</hi>
and <hi>Topographical Tables, Geuealogies,</hi> and the like. It was thought fit
they should, provided that in the Tables and Maps there were no
pictures and babies, for avoiding superstition. The fifth proposal was
concerning the appointing of persons fit for the work of the Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The <hi>Praeses</hi> willed that every Province should exhibit by Bill the
Names of those, who they knew in their Provinces were of sufficiency for
the Translation, which forthwith was done, and the Names that were
exhibited were all pronounced in the Synod: but out of these who
should be chosen for the work was differ'd, until the next Session ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
upon the Monday following<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> and so with prayer they brake
up the meeting.</p>
                     <p>As I have done in this Session, so will I do in all the rest, if I shall
get convenient place where I may stand and note. For, for any thing
I see, mine own notes must be my chiefest help. The matters are but

                     <p>ON Wednesday the 18/28 of <hi>November,</hi> those of the Synod met in the
morning. This <hi>Session was only deliberative, for they concluded nothing.</hi>
The proposall was, <hi>what form of catechizing</hi> both for children and youths
should be thought fittest to be put in practise in the <hi>Belgick</hi> Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.
The <hi>Praeses</hi> first spake many things learnedly of the necessity of
Catechizing, that it was the <hi>basis</hi> and ground of Religion, and the sole
way of <hi>transfusing</hi> the principles of Christianity into men: that it was
very ancient, practised by the <hi>Patriarchs,</hi> by the <hi>Apostles,</hi> by <hi>Origen,</hi> and
approved by the consent of the <hi>fathers:</hi> that from the neglect of this
came the ignorance of the common sort, and that multitude of sects a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
them, of <hi>Papists Anabaptists, Libertines, &amp;c.</hi> whereas if an uniform
course of teaching them their first principles had been taken up, there
would not have been so many differences: that there was now greater
necessity then ever of reviving this custom, because of the <hi>Jesuits</hi> who
mightily labour in this kind, as appeared by some of their acts lately in
<hi>Frisia, &amp;c.</hi> Next were the Deputyes for the strangers called upon to
deliver what formes of Catechizing were in their Churches put in use:
which they did, and gave them to the <hi>Praeses</hi> in writing. After these,
the Professors, and the other Deputyes spake their mindes, and almost
all gave them up in writings, which were immediately pronounced in
publick by the Scribe; and such as spake <hi>memoriter,</hi> promised to set
down their opinions <hi>in script<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>,</hi> and deliver them to the <hi>Praeses</hi> after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.
The principall heads on which they insisted, were these: that
there might be three degrees of Catechizing, one <hi>Domestical,</hi> to be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
by Fathers and Masters in their familyes: another <hi>Scholasticall</hi> to
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114807:129"/>
be used by Scholemasters in publick Scholes: and a third <hi>Ecclesiasticall</hi>
to be practised by the minister in the Church, that so fathers might fit
their children for the Scholes, the Scholes for the Church: That there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
parents and masters should be admonished to look to this duty in
their familyes: That Scholemasters should be chosen, such as were skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
themselves to catechize, and that they should be carefull to bring
their scholars to catecheticall sermons; that from sermons they should
presently call them to the Schole, and there examine them how they had
profited: The minister of every parish together with the Seniours and
Deacons should monethly or quarterly visit the Scholes, and know the
Scholars proficiency in this behalf: that the Ministers before the times
of the Communion should repair unto private Families, and Catechize:
that the Magistrates would be pleased to provide stipends for Schole-Masters,
so to make them the more cheerful: that there should be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of Catechizing according to the variety of the age, one for Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
which should contein the <hi>Lords Prayer,</hi> the <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
the Doctrine of the <hi>Sacraments, &amp;c.</hi> that for such as were elder,
other things should be added according to their capacity: that to take
away confusion one form of Catechisme in each kinde should be used;
that the <hi>Jesuits</hi> Catechismes of <hi>Lessius, Canisius, Ledesma, &amp;c.</hi> should be
abolisht. All this and more by sundrie men was exhibited in writing,
and read in the audience of the Synod.</p>
                     <p>That which hitherto hath been done concerns only the manner of
Catechizing, as for the matter of the Catechisme, that was not now
thought fit to be spoken of, but was put off till the end of the Synod.
When all had spoken their pleasures the <hi>Praeses</hi> signifyed, that he toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the <hi>Assessors</hi> and <hi>Scribes</hi> would compare all these Writings to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
and out of them all gather one forme of Catechizing as they
thought best, and exhibit it unto the Synod to be approved of, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
to their liking. And so the Session ended. Amongst the rest,
there were some particulars told. One of the Deputies of <hi>Geldria,</hi> to
shew the force of private Catechizing, related that amongst them there
was a Minister, who when he first came to his Living, found his Church
quite empty, because all his Parishioners were Papists; and therefore
if he would preach, he was to preach to the bare Walls: but he takes so
much pains as to go to every of his Parish privately unto their houses,
and there by familiar conversing with them, and expounding unto
them the grounds of Religion, he so far prevailed with them, that in
the compass of a year he gain'd them all to come to Church, and by
this means hath scarce a Papist in his Parish. <hi>But doubtless the most ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
way of all the rest to bring young persons to learn their Catechisme,
was that which was related by one of the</hi> Helvetian Deputies. <hi>For he told
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:114807:130"/>
us that in his Countrey the manner was, that all young persons that meant to
marry were to repair, both he and she, unto their Minister, a little before they
meant to marry, and by him to be examin'd how well they had conn'd their
Catechisme: if they had not done it perfectly to his minde, he had power to
deferre their Marriage till they had better learnt their Lessons.</hi> I was much
affected to this course when I heard it; and I thought that doubtless it
was a speedy way to make all young persons, excepting my self and two
or three more that mean not overhastily to marry, to be skilfull in their
Catechisme. The Synod shall be ill advis'd, if they make no use of it.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Dean this day is to make a Latin Sermon in the Synod-house, and
after that there are certain Supplications exhibited to the Synod to be
considered of. What they are, and what they contein I will inform
your Honour by the next convenient Messenger. I have suffered <hi>Daniel</hi>
to come home, and supply himself of some necessaries, but to return
to me again upon Saterday, except your Honour shall otherwise ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.
His lodging and dyet are provided, and he will be serviceable
to me this ill wether, to be sent in business, my self not being so well
able in dirt and snow to trace the streets. But this I leave to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
consideration, and for this present I humbly take my leave.</p>

                     <p>UPon Thursday, 19/29 of this present, the Synod being met together,
Mr. <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> made in the Synod-house a polite and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical
Latine Sermon; the portion of Scripture he chose for his
Theme was the 17 verse of the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Ecclesiastes, Noli esse justus nimium,
neque esto sapiens nimis.</hi> After a witty coming upon his text, how it
should come that Righteousness and Wisdom, which are every where
commended unto us, should here seem to receive a check, he shewed how
men might seem to be too just; First the Seculars, when sitting in place
of Justice they stood too strictly in keeping the Letter of the Law, and
then by inflicting too heavy punishments, when in equity lighter would
serve: next in the second word <hi>sapiens nimis,</hi> he taxt the Divines for
presuming too far in prying into the Judgements of God, and so came
to reprove the curious Disputes which our age hath made concerning
Predestination; that this Dispute for its endlesness was like the Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical
line, <hi>divisibilis in semper divisibilia;</hi> that it was in Divinity, as
the Rule of <hi>Cos</hi> is in Arithmetick. For the ending of these Disputes his
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:114807:130"/>
advice unto the Synod was, that both parts contending should well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
of <hi>S. Pauls</hi> discourse in the ninth to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and for their
final determination both should exhibit unto the Synod a plain perspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enous
and familiar paraphrase on that Chapter. For if the meaning of
that Discourse were once perfectly opened, the question were at an end.
From hence he came to exhort them to stand to the former determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ions,
which had hitherto most generally past in the Reformed Churches,
in these points: and told them that it was an especial part of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties
Commission to exhort them to keep unalter'd the former Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessions.
How fit it was to open so much of their Commission, and thus
to express themselves for a party against the Remonstrants your Honour
can best judge. After this he brought a very pathetical conclusion, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting
of a vehement exhortation to peace and union, and so he ended.
The <hi>Praeses</hi> gave him thanks for his good pains, and then told us, whereas
it was once purposed to lay open before the Synod certain <hi>Libelli suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi>
(which I mentioned to your Honour in my last Letters) he might not
now do it, for some reasons which he then conceal'd. And so he dismist
the Synod without doing any thing farther. What these <hi>Libelli supplices</hi>
contain, is unknown. Some imagine it to be from the Remonstrant par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
others more probably think, that the subject of them were certain
<hi>Gravamina</hi> of the Countrey Ministers.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Deans</hi> Sermon was taken well, for any thing I can yet learn to
the contrary; but your Lordship shall understand, there was a little
doubt made concerning these Latine Sermons. Mr. <hi>Praeses,</hi> when the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
were directed to the <hi>Arminian</hi> party, requested the Forreigners that
they would be pleased to bestow in their Courses some Latin Sermons
to entertain the Synod till the <hi>Arminians</hi> made their appearance; and
first commended this unto the English. <q>My Lord Bishop refused it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
of the suddain warning: but Mr. Dean would needs undertake
it. But certain of the <hi>Exteri</hi> came to the Bishop, and shewed him how
dangerous this might be. For it was, as they thought, a very hard
matter so to walk, as not to touch upon some points that are in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversy,
which could not be without the offence of one party.</q> My
Lord Bishop and the other two, for this reason thought the motion very
inconvenient: but Mr. Dean would by no means apprehend of it, but
as of a business very fit to be done. It seems this was the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
of the Forreigners, which was the cause that there was in this
kinde nothing done till now, notwithstanding that the motion was
made a pretty while before my coming to <hi>Dort.</hi> But how well this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
is approved, it will appear, if others of the Forreigners do fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
it. Here is a rumour of a certain Jesuitical book, lately set forth
in disgrace of our Synod. I have not yet seen it, but I understand it is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114807:131"/>
in the hands of the <hi>Praeses</hi> unto whom I had repair'd to have looked into
it, but that I conceive him to be exceeding full of business. As soon as
I can learn what it is, I will acquaint your Honour with it. We have
much speech of a strange Comet of an unusual length seen this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
I saw it not; and peradventure it is no Newes unto your Lordship,
if it have appeared in the Horison of the <hi>Hague.</hi> My Lord Bishop and
his Company remember their Love and Service to your Honour, and
thank you for your Letter of English Newes, which they here return.
I have sent according to your Lordships Will six Catalogues of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
printed with us in Latin. And so for this time I humbly take my
leave.</p>

                     <p>UPon Friday the 20/30 of <hi>Novemb.</hi> the Deputies met in the Morning:
where first of all, there were recited the Judgements of some
concerning the manner of Catechizing which was yet depending, who
had not delivered their mindes in writing the day before. In this was
there nothing extraordinary, save only the advice of the Remonstrants
of <hi>Utrecht.</hi> For the Deputies of that Province gave their Judgments
severally, the <hi>Contra-Remonstrants</hi> by themselves, and the <hi>Remonstrants</hi>
by themselves. These first blamed the common Catechisme passant
amongst them, as being too obscure for the Simple, and too long for the
Memory. Secondly they thought it not necessary that there should be
a threefold Catechism, for one well learnt might serve for all the rest.
Thirdly, they would have a Catechism so made, that the Answers might
be nothing else but bare Texts of H. Scripture. For they thought, that
if Scripture alone were taught, and not any mens glosses, it would be a
more immediate means to gain the Anabaptists and other Schismaticks to
accept of the Catechism. Fourthly, they thought fit that in the Preface to
these Catechisms, there should be a note given to this purpose; that these
kinds of writing by Catechisms, &amp;c. were to be esteemed only as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochryphal
Scriptures.</hi> To the third point some little thing was answered
to this purpose, that this was a mean utterly to extirpate all other Forms
of Catechizings out of the Church, there never yet having been any
form of Creed or Catechism so conceived. Yet there might be a time
hereafter for the Synod to consider of it, when they pleased. After this
followed the Form of Catechizing, which the <hi>Praeses</hi> and <hi>Assessors</hi> had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
upon. My purpose was to have taken an extract of it and sent it to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114807:131"/>
your Honor, and I dealt with <hi>Festus Hommius</hi> about it; but his answer
was, that he was to communicate about this with the <hi>Praeses,</hi> and that it
was in the hand of <hi>Sebast. Dammannus</hi> his fellow Scribe. To <hi>Dammannus</hi> I
was not known, neither did I understand of any acquaintance he had
with your Honor, and therefore I let it rest. The summe of it was
this. That there should be observ'd a threefold Catechizing. 1. At home
by the Parents. 2. In the Schole by the Schole-master; A third in the
Church by Catechetical Sermons: then, that there should be a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
Catechism, one for <hi>Incipientes,</hi> containing the Lords Prayer, the
Creed, the Commandments, the Doctrine of the Sacraments, and the
Church Discipline. A second for the <hi>Middle sort,</hi> which should be a
brief of the <hi>Palatine</hi> Catechism: a third for <hi>Youths,</hi> the <hi>Palatine</hi> Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techism
it self. That every one that was admitted Scholemaster should
be bound to teach no other Catechism, and that all other Forms should
be abolisht: that if either Scholemasters in the Scholes, or Ministers
in the Church, should refuse or neglect to Catechize, they should be
subject to censure, &amp;c. When this Form was read, the Provinces were
in order askt what they would have alter'd or supplied. Those of <hi>Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria</hi>
thought it fit that the Minister before his Catechetical Sermon,
should not only take the words of the Catechism (as the custom had
in most places been) but likewise some Text of Scripture upon which
the doctrine of the Catechism was grounded. For, as it seems, the
custom is in Catechistical Sermons, not to take a Text of Scripture,
but a portion of the Catechism for their Text and Theme. It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
that this custom had been a long time laid down, and could not
now conveniently be recall'd: the same Deputies proposed, whether
it were not fit, that whereas in the Decree there is mention made of a
censure to pass on those who neglected it, there should be some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
form of Censure set down by the Synod. The thing being put
to voices, it was decreed, that it should be left to the Judgement of the
<hi>Classes</hi> how they should be censur'd. The <hi>South Hollanders</hi> thought it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
there should be publike catechizing in the Church by way of
Question and Answer. It was answered, that this could not be by reason
of the frequency of Sermons. Those of <hi>Overisell</hi> proposed somewhat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the form of chatechetical Sermons. It was answer'd that this
should hereafter be thought of. <q>
                           <hi>Which answer is a civil way which the</hi>
Praeses <hi>uses, when he means to put by an impertinent question.</hi>
                        </q> Last of all,
those of the <hi>Walon</hi> Churches requir'd that this Decree should not preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
them, who had already accepted of <hi>Beza's</hi> Catechism in their
Churches. Now whereas there were three Catechisms proposed, of which
there was but one in being, namely the <hi>Palatine,</hi> they consulted of depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
some, who should make the other two. The matter being put to Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114807:132"/>
there were chosen these six, <hi>Polyander, Gomarus, Tysius, Lydius,
Fauchelius, Udemannus.</hi> Here the <hi>Praeses</hi> proposed to the Synod, that
they would think of fit means for the Education and training up of
those who should enter the Ministery: but those of <hi>North Holland</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a doubt, wherein the Church of <hi>Amsterdam</hi> requir'd the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Synod. The matter is this. The Merchants of <hi>Amsterdam</hi>
having Traffick into the <hi>East Indies,</hi> took into their Families many of
the Youths and Infants of that Country, but doubted whether they
were to be baptized or no. The question was thus proposed, <q>
                           <hi>Whether
the children of Ethnick parents adopted into the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>milies of Christians
were to be baptized, if so be they who did offer them to be baptized did
undertake that they should be brought up in the Christian Faith.</hi>
                        </q> But both
these questions were put over to the next Session, and so the Synod brake
up. This afternoon the Dutchess of <hi>Tremullio</hi> came to Town. The English
went to entertain her, where my Lord Bishop made a speech unto her
in Latin, which by her Chaplain was interpreted unto her, who like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in her name returned answer. But of the particulars of this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment,
I suppose My Lord Bishop in his Letters relates more fully
to your Honour, then I can; for I was not there.</p>
                     <p>On Saterday the first of <hi>December, stylo novo,</hi> the Deputies being met
in the morning, the question concerning means of education of those
who should be fitted for the Ministry was proposed; where, because
they found it to be a greater matter then it seem'd when at first it was
proposed, the Provinces requested further respite, excepting the <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
and <hi>South Hollanders,</hi> who there delivered up their Judgements
<hi>in scripto.</hi> The substance of what the <hi>Zelanders</hi> delivered was this: that
it would please the <hi>States General</hi> to appoint that a certain number of
Youths might be bred up for the Ministry at the charge of the publike
purse. That the wealthier sort would send such of their children to
the Scholes, as they thought fittest to make Scholars. That out of these
should be chosen youths of ingenuous Parentage and Manners, of good
wit, of strength and health of body, which should be sent unto the
University. That in the University there might be distinct Colledges
for every Province, and in these Colledges there might be Regents and
Supervisors, which might prescribe unto Youths a Method of study, and
not suffer them to wander in variety of study, and not persit themselves
in some one kinde. That there might some time be prefixt for their
abode in the University, as five or six years. And because many upon
two years study seek for preferment in the Church, and others on the
contrary stay in the University over long; for remedy of both these
there might a time be fixt wherein the whole course of study should be
absolv'd. That these Students every year should give an account of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114807:132"/>
their proficiency to their Parents and Benefactors, and such as bred
them up: that after this they should go and visit forreign Churches
and Universities to see and observe. That at their coming home they
bring with them the Testimonies of the Pastors and Governors of
the Churches and Universities wherein they have been, and exhibit
them to the <hi>Classes</hi> where they are to live; and expect their calling
to the Ministery. That they should publickly in the Church read the
Scriptures before the people, for this would make them known to the
Church, embolden them to speak to the multitude, and mend their
voices and delivery. That by consent of the <hi>Classes</hi> they be permitted
to be with the Pastors, to conferre with them in <hi>Cases</hi> of <hi>Conscience,</hi>
to go with them when they visit the sick, that thus they may learn
how to deal in these cases, and how to conceive prayers upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
That to fit them for the Church Regiment, which is a thing not
learnt in Scholes, some moneths before their Institution, they converse
in the greater Cities, to be present in the Presbyteries and the Meetings
of the Deacons, to understand how Voices may be asked and gathered,
how Church Discipline is to be exercised, and what in divers cases is
to be done. That they be examin'd how fit they be to reform mens
manners. That it were fit that even in Universities Youths were train'd
up in <hi>Practick Divinity</hi> and <hi>Cases</hi> of <hi>Conscience.</hi> The substance of what
the <hi>South-Hollanders</hi> delivered was this. First that Youths should stay
at least two years in the University, and publickly read the Scriptures
in the Church. Secondly, that after this they publickly dispute of
some difficult question in Religion. Thirdly, that they be examined
of all the Articles in Religion, and if they give satisfaction, then they
may be admitted <hi>ad Propositiones,</hi> (what these are I know not) and
after a years exercise in them, they may be examined by the <hi>Classes,</hi>
who if they finde them fit may give them leave to exercise themselves
in Catechizing and Preaching. That to learn Church Government
they be admitted to <hi>Consistories</hi> and <hi>Classes</hi> to see what there is done,
so that what there they see they keep in silence. That they leave not
the studies of Divinity to meddle with other things. That they may
have leave to <hi>Baptize,</hi> if the necessity of Rural Churches require. Yet
they must expect a year ere they be admitted, which is not to be done
without sufficient Testimony that all hath been done which is requir'd.
The rest of the Provinces requir'd respite till Monday: and so they
past to the Question which was proposed in the Name of the Churches
of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> concerning the Baptizing of the Children of Ethnick
Parents. The <hi>English</hi> first exhibited their mindes in Writing to this
effect. That Infants, if they were justly taken, as, if they were given,
or bought, or the like, (for it might not be lawful fraudulently or
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114807:133"/>
violently to take them from their Parents) ought to be baptized.
For so it is recorded of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he circumcised every one in his
house, even those whom he had bought with his Mony: but if they
were <hi>Adulti,</hi> they might not be Baptized till they made Profession of
the Christian Faith. With these agreed the <hi>Bremenses</hi> and the <hi>Professors.</hi>
On the contrary the <hi>Helvetians</hi> and <hi>South-Hollanders</hi> concluded, that
the Infants of Ethnick Parents ought not to be baptized, till they
came to be of years to declare their Faith. Their chief reason was,
because Baptisme was a Sign of the Covenant: but the Infants of Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
Parents are not born within the Covenant, and therefore they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be partakers of this Signe. <q>Here was a little indirect dealing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the <hi>Helvetians</hi> and the <hi>Bremenses.</hi> The <hi>Helvetians</hi> Scribe had
by some means or other suffered a copie of the reason for their
opinion to be brought aforehand to those of <hi>Breme,</hi> who openly in the
Synod house, <hi>in scripto</hi> refuted them:</q> which thing is feared will cause
some choler. And this was all that this day was done concerning this
question, and so both the questions yet depend. The Synod did the
sooner end, because they were at eleven a clock to go to the Funeral of
<hi>Henricus ab Hell,</hi> who died lately, as I think I told your Honour. The
Solemnity was no more but this. Some of the chief of the Town to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the whole Synod went to the House where he died, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
him to the Church, laid him in his Grave, and went
home again, almost in as little space as I have told it you. The
Dutchess of <hi>Tremullio</hi> was at this Session, and as I hear, spake ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
well of the Synod, commending it both for Piety and good
Order.</p>
                     <p>The Remonstrants are now every day expected. We understand that
they are already met together at <hi>Leyden.</hi> 
                        <q>Mr. <hi>Praeses</hi> came this day
to my Lord Bishop, and under <hi>Benedicite</hi> told him, that it was thought
the Remonstrants would become Suiters to the Secular Deputies,
for some greater respect in the Synod, then it is likely otherwise
they should have: and that for this they would use the <hi>English</hi> as
Mediators. Then, that they would call in question the right of his
Presidentship, as being made only by the Provincials without any
respect had unto the Forreigners. To this my Lord Bishop replyed,
that for the first, since they were Members of the Synod, they
would not do any thing clancularily without the Consent and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity
of the whole Company. To the second he answered, that
hitherto they had acknowledged him for their <hi>Praeses,</hi> and so they
would continue to do, notwithstanding any objection might be
fancyed, so that of them he might secure himself.</q> And this is
all hath hapned since Friday Morning, at what time I addrest my last

Letters unto your Honour: and for this time commending your
Lordship to Gods good Protection, I humbly take my leave.</p>

                     <p>MY Letters conteining the acts of our Synod upon Friday and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday,
I dispatched this morning unto your Honour by a Soldier
whom I knew not, and he delivered them to a Skipper whom he knew
not, and whether or no they came to your Lordships hands I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.
There are to come with them Letters from my Lord Bishop to
your Honour. Upon Monday the third of <hi>Decemb.</hi> the Deputies being
met, they prosecuted the two questions before left undecided; First of
the Baptizing of children born of Ethnick parents: secondly, of means
considerable how to breed up those who are to enter the Ministry. In
the first, concerning the <hi>adulti,</hi> the Synod agreed, that if they made
profession of the Christian Faith they might be baptized, <hi>etiam invitis
parentibus.</hi> Their reason was, because that after children came to be of
years, in case of Religion they depended not from the power of their
parents, but might make their own market. All the difficulty was of
infants, and children not yet of discretion to make their choice. The
<hi>English,</hi> the <hi>Professors,</hi> those of <hi>Hassia,</hi> those of <hi>Breme,</hi> of <hi>Zeland,</hi> of
<hi>Freesland</hi> thought it necessary they should be baptized, if they were
rightfully adopted into Christian Families, and that their parents had
altogether resigned them into the hands of the Christians. They
grounded themselves upon the examples of <hi>Abraham</hi> circumcising all
that were of his Family; of <hi>Paul</hi> baptizing whole housholds, of the
primitive Church recorded in S. <hi>Austin,</hi> who shews, that anciently
children that were <hi>exposititii</hi> were wont to be taken up by the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
and baptized. Now such were the children of Ethnick parents; for
it was never esteem'd lawful for Christians to expose their children. All
the rest were peremptory that they were not to be baptiz'd, till they came
to be of years of Discretion, to make profession of the Faith. The
<hi>North Hollanders</hi> themselves, whose business it was, and who moved
the Synod in it, were expresly against it; whether they were bought,
given, taken in war, or howsoever. Their reasons were, because they
are <hi>immundi;</hi> because they are <hi>extra foedus,</hi> of which Baptisme is a
signe; because Adoption could entitle them only to terrene, not to an
Heavenly inheritance, &amp;c. So that if plurality of voices carry it, the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114807:134"/>
negative part prevails. The <hi>Praeses</hi> requir'd some time to compare the
opinions together, and so for that time forbare to pronounce sentence.
And because the examples of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> were much stood upon
by those who held the affirmative, he proposed these two things to be
considered of. First, whether it were likely that in <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family,
when he put circumcision in act, there were any Infants, whose Parents
died uncircumcised. Secondly, whether it were likely that in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies
baptized by <hi>Paul,</hi> there were any Infants, whose Parents died
unbaptized: and so he past away to the second Question, concerning
the manner of training up those who were to enter the Ministry. In my
last Letters to your Honour I related at large the advice given in this
point by the <hi>Zelanders</hi> and <hi>South Hollanders.</hi> It was now proposed to
the Synod, whether they did approve their counsel, or except against
it. Some thought it was unlawful for men not in Orders to preach pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly,
or baptize; (for the <hi>South Hollanders</hi> in their advice, had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
they should,) others thought it unmeet, that they should be
present in the Consistories and meetings of Deacons, or that they
should read the Scriptures publickly in the Church (which was the
joint advice of the <hi>Zelanders</hi> and <hi>South Hollanders.)</hi> Lastly, it was
doubted whether the Synod could make any Decree in this Question;
because of the several customs in several Provinces, which it lay not
in the power of the Synod to prejudice. So that instead of deciding
this one doubt the <hi>Praeses</hi> proposed five more to be considered of.
1. Whether men not in Orders might make publike Sermous. 2. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they might baptize. 3. Whether it were fit they should come into
the Consistories. 4. Whether they should read the Scriptures pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely.
5. Whether the Synod could make a Decree in this business,
for the reason above mentioned, or only give advice. The Synod had
begun to speak to the two first, and it was the general opinion that
they might not baptize. In the point of preaching they differ'd. Some
thought absolutely it might be permitted them: others on the contrary
thought no: some took a middle course, thinking they might preach pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
before a select Auditory, who were to be their Judges how suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
they were for that end: some that they may do it openly, so that it
were understood they did it not <hi>cum potestate solvendi &amp; ligandi.</hi> But when
part of the Synod had spoken their mindes, because the time was much
pass'd, they brake up, and put off the determination to the next Session.</p>
                     <p>Here is a rumor that some of the Remonstrants are come to Town,
who they are I cannot yet learn. I shall to morrow make inquiry, and by
the next Messenger acquaint your Lordship with it. In the mean time
I humbly take my leave.</p>

                     <p>UPon Tuesday the fourth of <hi>Decemb. Stylo novo,</hi> the Deputies being
met in the morning they proceeded to determine of those doubts,
which were moved the Session before. In the matter consulted concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the training up of those who were to take upon them the Ministry,
there were five questions moved. 1. Whether it were fit they should
preach publikely. 2. Whether they should baptize. 3. Whether they
should come to the Consistories and meetings of the <hi>Classes.</hi> 4. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they should read the Scriptures publikely in the Church before
the people. Lastly, whether they should make a Decree to binde all
Provinces necessarily, or only to advise them. To the first two the
<hi>Exteri</hi> had given their answer in the former Session. For the question
of Baptism, no man stood upon it, but all accounted it unlawful, for
men not in orders to take upon them to baptize: the doubt was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Sermons. <hi>Jo. Polyander</hi> thought it very fit that such as intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Ministry, before they were admitted should practise preaching.
First because it was the practise of some of the Belgick Churches. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
because it took from them that <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, that subrustick shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastness
of many men, by which they feared to speak unto the people.
Thirdly, because it was convenient that they should be known for men
fit for that duty, before they should enter upon it. Fourthly, that they
might approve themselves to their Parents and Benefactors, who had
been at the charge of their Education. Provided that it were with
these conditions: first that it were done with consent of the <hi>Classes:</hi>
Secondly that it were practised only when the Church was unsupplied,
either by the death, or absence, or sickness of their Pastor, or in case of
like necessity. With <hi>Polyander</hi> did <hi>Wallaeus</hi> of <hi>Middleburgh</hi> agree, and
grounded himself upon the practise of the Jews, amongst whom not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Levites, but others also publickly taught the Law, as it appears
by the story in the <hi>Acts,</hi> where <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> coming into the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,
the Rulers call'd unto them, <hi>that if they had any word of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation,
they should speak unto the people.</hi> Contrary unto both these was
<hi>D. Gamarus,</hi> who held it utterly unlawful for any to preach before
they were admitted to the Ministry. First, because they had no Missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
<hi>and who can preach except he be sent.</hi> Secondly, because they had
not the Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven. Thirdly, it was granted
that they could not baptize: now Christ hath put Baptisme and
Preaching together, <hi>Go teach all Nations baptizing them: &amp; quae Deus
conjunxit home ne separet.</hi> Last of all, though there had been a custom
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114807:135"/>
in some places to the contrary, yet fitter it was that custom should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
it self to Truth, then Truth to custom. With <hi>Gomarus</hi> agreed
<hi>Thysius,</hi> and thought his argument drawn from Mission to be unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable;
and for mine own part I thought so to. <hi>D. Gomarus</hi> is a man
of great note; but I never heard him speak with any strength of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
in the Synod till now. What <hi>Silrandus</hi> his opinion was concerning
the point I know not; for he doth so favour his voice, that I can never
tell what he saith: and I imagine I have no great loss of it. After the
Professors was there little said, which was not said before, only <hi>Lydius</hi>
of <hi>South Holland</hi> thought certainly to confute <hi>Gomarus,</hi> and told us,
that such men might preach, and that they had <hi>Vocation</hi> so to do. For
first that inward Vocation which they had from the Spirit, and then
their Examination and Admission by the <hi>Classes</hi> was warrant for them
sufficient to preach, though they had no particular charge. For this
good News did Mr. <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> publikely applaud <hi>D. Lydius</hi> in
the Synod. I mervail'd much with my self to see Mr. <hi>Dean</hi> and <hi>Lydius</hi>
so wide of the mark. For there was no question of those who were
admitted by the <hi>Classes,</hi> but only of such who fitted themselves to be
admitted. The Examination and Admission by the <hi>Classes</hi> is the very
form of their Ministry, and not their being placed over a particular
Church. And thus much at length did the <hi>Praeses</hi> tell us. When all
had spoken, Mr. <hi>Praeses</hi> pronounced that it was concluded by the Synod,
that it should not be lawful for them to baptize: but for the matter of
Sermons, it was thought good by the Synod, that it should be left to
the Judgement and Discretion of the particular <hi>Classes.</hi> In the third
question concerning the Admission of the <hi>Proponentes</hi> (as they call them)
to the Consistories, little was said, and so in the fourth, concerning the
publike reading of Scripture in the Church; Some thought fit that
the ancient custom of <hi>Anagnostae</hi> in the Church should be revived:
others thought it some disparagement to publike Reading, that it was
committed to Tradesmen, and many times to men unskilfull, that
knew not well to read: In both these the Synod determined nothing,
but left them free to the discretion of the <hi>Classes;</hi> and the later was
to be left to the Liberty of the <hi>Proponentes,</hi> whether they would read or
no; and that they were not to be inforced to it, it they would not.
In the last question whether they should make any necessary Decree
binding all, or only by way of Counsel, my Lord Bishop being asked
what he thought fit, made answer, that they were to distinguish betwixt
things necessary, and not necessary. Things absolutely necessary should
be absolutely decreed: other things should be left arbitrary. Which
sentence pass'd by the major part of voices, and was Synodically con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.
Here the Deputies for the Remonstrants of <hi>Utrecht</hi> exhibited
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114807:135"/>
to the Synod in Writing a Bill, containing some exceptions against
what hitherto had pass'd in the matter of the Catechism. First they
misliked that any such form should be forced upon them. Secondly,
that all Scholemasters should be so strictly bound to that form, as that
it should not be lawful to recede from it. For this did prejudice all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
forms now currant, and might discontent the <hi>Lutherans</hi> and
others, who had admitted of another form. Thirdly, they charged
the <hi>Praeses</hi> with some indirect dealing. For whereas he had, whilest the
business was in <hi>fieri,</hi> solemnly protested, that there was no intent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the matter, but only concerning the form of Catechizing, yet
in the issue they had confirmed the <hi>Palatine</hi> Catechism, which contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
as well matter as form. Fourthly, they misliked the Decree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the not premising of a Text of Scripture before cateche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Sermons. Lastly, they required that this their dissent might
be registred. To this the <hi>Praeses</hi> replyed, that the Synod had only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest
it self what it thought fittest to be done. As for the necessity of
Execution, that was not in the power of the Synod, but of the States
General, who when all was done, might either pass or recall what
they thought good. Secondly to the point concerning himself, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
he had done so, and thought it fittest so to do (but the Synod
thought otherwise) and since there was a matter of Catechism to be
concluded, they thought they might confirm this as well as any other:
and this was not so confirm'd, but that it was in the power of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
to alter what they please. To the point of premising a Text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
before the catechetical Sermon, he answered that the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of the Synod was not to take that custom away there where it
it was in use, but only to prohibit the urging of it there where it had
a long time been disused. To the last, concerning the Registring of this
their dissent, he answer'd, he saw not how this could be granted them;
since the States General had concluded, that what pass'd by a major part
of voices, should alone be accounted the Act of the Synod: and by the
same proportion every one that passes not his voice with the major
part might require his dissent to be registred. After this the <hi>Praeses</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
that concerning the question of the baptizing of Ethnicks children
put up by the Church of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> he required yet farther respite;
because of the opinion of some of the Synod, which was somewhat
ambiguous and obscure. He was therefore to conferre with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of it, and therefore desir'd that the resolution might be put off
till the next Session: and withall he commended to the Synod the
consideration how the liberty of printing so promiscuously all kinde of
scandalous and libellous Pamphlets might be represt, and so he dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
the Synod.</p>

                        <pb n="22" facs="tcp:114807:136"/>The Remonstrants are in Town, but because they keep themselves
private, and have not presented themselves unto the States and Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
there is no notice taken of it. And so commending your Honor to
Gods good Protection, I humbly take my leave.</p>

                     <p>UPon Wednesday the 5. of <hi>December, stylo novo,</hi> the Deputies being
met in the morning, the first thing which was done, was the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
of a Senior or Elder for those of <hi>Groninga,</hi> whose number as
it seems was not yet full. The thing was transacted in Dutch, and yet
the consent of the English was askt: at which I did not a little muse.
Next followed the advice of the <hi>Helvetians,</hi> what course was to be
taken with those, who are to enter the Ministry; in which there was
no great matter from what before was intimated. The <hi>Palatini</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd
the like, and therefore the <hi>Praeses</hi> requir'd yet farther respite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they did conceive any form of Decree in this behalf. <q>Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the Decree of the Synod concerning the question moved by
those of <hi>Amsterdam,</hi> about the <hi>Baptism of children born of Ethnick
Parents.</hi> The Decision consisted of two parts. The first concern'd
the <hi>Adulti,</hi> and it was this; <hi>That such as were of years and capacity
should be diligently taught and catechized, and then, if they did desire
it, they should be baptized.</hi> The second concern'd Infants, and it was,
<hi>That till they came to years of Discretion, they should by no means be
baptized.</hi> A strange decision, and such as, if my memory or reading
fails me not, no Church either Ancient or Modern ever gave. When
it was objected, what if they were in danger of death; their answer
was, that the want of Baptism would not prejudice them with God,
except we would determine as the Papists do, that Baptism is neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to salvation. Which is as much to undervalue the necessity of
Baptism as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth overvalue it.</q> Here followed a
recitation of all that had been done since the business of the Catechism
had been set on foot: amongst the rest was registred the exceptions of
the Remonstrants of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> and it was added, <hi>atque iis est à Praeside
satisfactum.</hi> Those of <hi>Utrecht</hi> excepted against that word <hi>satisfactum:</hi>
they had, said they, an answer given them, but no satisfaction. For they
persisted in their former opinion: and forthwith that word was alter'd.
Here was a doubt moved, whether it were not fit that some of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114807:136"/>
especial <hi>Reasons</hi> brought by the Synod in the Question of the Baptism of
Infants should not be added to the Decree. <hi>It was answered, That Reasons
were obnoxious to cavil and exceptions, and it was not for the Authority of
the Synod to Reason, but to Decree.</hi> After this the <hi>Praeses</hi> signified to the
Synod that the time prefixt for the appearance of the Remonstrants was
now expiring, and yet nothing was signified concerning their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
neither to the Secular President, nor Ecclesiastical. Wherefore
naming them all, he thought good to <hi>cite</hi> them to appear. It was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
by those of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> that they did provide and would shortly be
forth coming. In the mean while to take up the time, Mr. <hi>Praeses</hi>
thought good to commend to the Synod the consideration and redress
of those abuses which were in Printing. Every man was suffered to

                        </gap>lous Pamphlets. Many here delivered
their opinions, others requir'd farther time to think of it. The English
first thought fit that the States General should be requested to take the
care of this into their hands. That there should be Censors to approve
all such Books as should go to the Press. That no man should print, but
such as were known to be of the Reformed Religion. Unto this advice
divers things were added by others; as that there should be a set num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Printers: that they should be sworn: that there should be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Laws prescribed unto them: that they should print no Heretical
Books, especially the Books of <hi>David Georgius, H. Nicolaus Socinus:</hi>
that no libels, no unlawful pictures, either obscene, or made to any
mans disgrace, should be permitted: that no Book should be printed
without the names of the Author, Printer, Place, except the Synod
or the Magistrates did in some cases otherwise think good: that there
should be care that the Correctors for the Press were good Scolars:
and many other things of the like nature. Then were there read cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Canons made in some Synods before, concerning this business.
<hi>Theodatus</hi> of <hi>Geneva</hi> told us, that in his travails, at <hi>Venice</hi> he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd
that there was a Colledge of sundry persons, secular and
spiritual, to whose care was committed all the business of Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
He thought it fit there should be such Colledges here erected.
When all had spoken that would, the <hi>Praeses</hi> told them that <hi>Adrian
Smoutius</hi> had written a little Book in the <hi>Belgick,</hi> Tongue unto the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
and sent the copies of it to him to be distributed. And so request<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them to take in good part the good will of the man, for want of
more business the Synod brake up.</p>
                     <p>At length are we coming to the main battel. The Armies have been
in sight one of another, and have had some parly. The manner was
this. Upon Thursday the 6. of <hi>Decemb. stylo novo.</hi> The Synod being set in
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114807:137"/>
the morning, the <hi>Praeses</hi> signified, that there had come unto him in the
name of the Remonstrants these fower, <hi>H. Leo, Niellius, Matthisius,</hi> and
<hi>Pinakerus,</hi> to give notice that the Remonstrants were ready according
to their <hi>Citation;</hi> but because they had but lately come unto the Town,
that yet convenient Lodgings were not provided, their papers, books
and stuff were confused, therefore they requir'd respite either till Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday,
or at least Friday morning. The President of the <hi>Politicks</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
that they should come, and personally make appearance before
the Synod, and there propose their mindes, and if the Synod approved
their causes, they might be deferr'd. Upon this were two of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties
of <hi>Utrecht</hi> sent forth, to give them warning to provide for their
present appearance. In the mean while, till they came, the <hi>Praeses</hi>
thought fit, that such as in the former Session delivered not themselves
concerning the Reformation of abuses in Printing, should now do it.
Here was little delivered, besides what was said the day before, only
some few particulars, as that order should be taken to repress this long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
humour in many men of coming to the Press: that there should be
no Impression of the Bible at any time without leave had: Forreign
Books brought out of other Countreys should not be distracted here
without peculiar leave, after their being perused by the Censurers: to
ease the Censurers, that they might not be troubled with reading too
great a multitude of improfitable books, it was thought fit, that the
books should first be brought to the <hi>Classes,</hi> and what they approved
should be brought to the Censurers, &amp;c. In the mean while the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants
came, all that were cited by Letters, and were admitted into the Synod. <q>
                           <hi>There is in the midst of the Synod-House a long Table, set, as
it seems, for them; for it hath hitherto been void, no man sitting at it:
here Chairs and Forms being set, they were willed to sit down.</hi>
                        </q> The <hi>Praeses</hi>
told them, that he had commended to the Synod their Suit of being a
little respited: but it was the will of the Deputies for the States, that
they should come before the Synod, and propose their cause themselves.
<hi>Episcopius</hi> standing up, spake to this effect. <q>First he prayed God to
give a blessing to this Meeting, and to poure into their mindes such
conceits, as best fitted men come together for such ends: then he
signified, that according to their Citation they were now come <hi>ad
collationem instituendam,</hi> concerning that cause, which hitherto with
a good Conscience they had maintain'd. As for the point of delay,
true it is they spake to the <hi>Praeses</hi> concerning a respite until Saterday
or Friday, by reason of that great distraction of their books and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
and want of convenient lodging, but not as a petition to be
moved in that behalf unto the Synod; but only as a thing which out
of common equity they might have presumed on without acquainting
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:114807:137"/>
the Synod with it. For they were ready, even at that present to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
the business they came for, without any further delay. But this
they left to the Deputies Secular and Ecclesiastical to determine of.</q>
Then were they requested to withdraw a little into a chamber near the
Synod House; and immediately was it proposed unto the Synod, what
time was to be set for to begin. The time prefixt was the morrow after.
<hi>Jo. Polyander</hi> took hold of those words, <hi>ad collationem,</hi> and told the
Synod, that it was fit the Remonstrants were told the end of their
coming, and the manner of proceeding which should be taken with
them,that they might know what they were to look for, and so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide.
They were to be inform'd, that they came not to conference;
neither did the Synod profess it self an adverse party against them.
Conferences had been heretofore held to no purpose. They ought to
have heeded the words of the Letters by which they were <hi>cited.</hi> They
were called, not to conference, but to propose their Opinions with their
Reasons, and leave it to the Synod to judge of them. The Synod
would be a Judge, and not a party. Then were they call'd in again,
and all this was told them. <hi>Episcopius</hi> answered, that for the word <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latio</hi>
he stood not on it, and how they would carry themselves it should
appear the day following. Mean while one thing they would request of
the Synod: that is, that <hi>Grevinchovius</hi> and <hi>Goulartius</hi> should be sent
for to the Synod as Patrons of this cause. That they had this last week
exhibited a Supplication to the States General to this purpose, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceav'd
this answer, that they should put this matter to the Synod, and
if the Synod thought it fit to be granted, they would not be against it.
Neither did they propose this to seek delayes. For they were ready,
whilst these men should be sent for to proceed to the action. Only they
thought fit, that to maintain their cause they should be sent for, who
could best do it. Then were they again dismist: and one was sent to
them, to call for their Supplication to the Lords, and the Lords Answer.
To this they return'd, that the Lords gave this answer, not in writing,
but by word of mouth: and for the copy of their Supplication, they
called not for it any more. Then was the thing proposed unto the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
and the Secular Deputies replyed, that they would return their
answer on the morrow: and the same was the answer of the Synod.
Mr. <hi>Praeses</hi> thought that <hi>Grevinchovius</hi> might be admitted, <hi>salvis censuris
Ecclesiasticis:</hi> yet notwithstanding he thought good to acquaint the
Synod with the quality of this man, and thereupon he produced the
Act of the Provincial Synod of <hi>South Holland,</hi> wherein it was witnessed,
that the Synod, because he did refuse to appear when they <hi>cited</hi> him,
and because of many blasphemies in his Book, and of many reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
speeches against the Magistrates and against the Ministers, had
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114807:138"/>
suspended him <hi>ab omni munere Ecclesiastico.</hi> From this <hi>Grevinchovius</hi> had
not appealed to the National Synod, and therefore it was in the power
of the Synod to do what they thought fit. Then were the Remonstrants
again call'd in, and it was signifyed unto them, that on the morrow
they should understand the will of the Synod concerning their motion
made, and so were they again dismist; and the Session ended, the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
having first premised, that all other things yet depending, as the
Decree concerning the <hi>Proponentes,</hi> together with the Remedies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the abuses in Printing, and what else soever, must be deferr'd,
and the business in hand alone attended.</p>
                     <p>My Lord Bishop was desirous that Mr. <hi>Carleton</hi> should stay this day,
to see the coming of the Remonstrants. I would have had him stay to
morrow likewise, that he might have seen the manner of proceeding
with them; but he would not. Here is speech that <hi>Scultetus</hi> is to make
the next Latin Sermon; but when we know not. There is a rumour

                     </opener>
                     <p>IN my last Letters to your Honour, I related a doubt concerning the
Deputies for the Remonstrants of <hi>Utrecht;</hi> whether they were to
be a part of the Synod, or in the number of the Remonstrants, who
were <hi>cited</hi> to appear before the Synod. The reasons of that doubt,
which then I understood not were these. First, because in their Creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
Letters they were charged to defend the cause of the Remonstrants.
Now it could not be that they should be both Defendants and Judges in
the same cause. Secondly, it was objected that their case was the same
<hi>per omnia</hi> with <hi>Episcopius,</hi> who was to have been of the Synod, if he
would have brought his Credential Letters, as the rest of the Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors
were. But he refused it, because in the Remonstrants cause he was
to be a party, except he would have laid by the Defence of that cause.
Thirdly, when the question was of <hi>citing</hi> the Remonstrants out of each
Province, it was then concluded in the Synod, that out of the Province
of <hi>Utrecht</hi> none should be <hi>cited</hi> to appear, because of that Province
there were some already, and therefore it was superfluous to <hi>cite</hi> any
more. In the judgment of the Synod therefore they were <hi>in numero
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114807:138"/>
citatorum,</hi> as far as concern'd that cause, and not in the number of the
Members of the Synod. Unto these Reasons were they cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ged to give
their answer upon Saterday, and then to resolve whether they would
forsake the words of their Credential Letters, and so remain Judges, or
else stand unto them, and become in the number of the <hi>citati.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
upon Saterday, the 8. of <hi>December, stylo novo,</hi> The Synod being
met in the morning, the Deputies for the Remonstrants gave up their
Answer <hi>in scripto</hi> to these Reasons. And to the first concerning the
Clause in their Credential Letters, they answered, that they were not so
limited, but that in their private instructions they had leave to do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
if they thought good. To the second, concerning the Parity of
their case with <hi>Episcopius,</hi> they answered, that their case was quite an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
for they were sent from their Provinces as Members of the
Synod, which plea <hi>Episcopius</hi> could not make. To the third, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the intent of the Synod at the <hi>Citation</hi> they answerd, that they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
so understood the words of the Synod, neither did they know but
that they might shew themselves for the cause of the Remonstrants, and
yet sit as Judges, since they were there to defend their opinion no
otherwise then the Contra-Remonstrants were to defend theirs: and
therefore they were purposed to take the oath, and to keep their places.
The <hi>Praeses</hi> then requir'd them to shew that clause in their private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions,
wherein that reservation was which they pretended. They
stuck a little at first to bring forth their instructions, but at length see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
there was no other remedy they consented to do it, provided that
no more should be read then what they would suffer: which was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them. In the mean time whilst they were providing to produce
their instructions, there were read in the Synod the letters of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall
Synod of <hi>South Holland,</hi> directed to the Nationall, to this
purpose: that whereas <hi>Theophilus Ryckwaerdius,</hi> one of those who was
<hi>cited</hi> among the Remonstrants, had lately been by them convented for
certain misdemeanors the Synod would be pleased to give him leave to
returne and make his answer to such objections as they had to charge
him with. The thing was put to the determination of the Synod. The
Deputies of the States thought fit it should be left to his own discretion
to do as he thought good. Others thought it not fit he should be sent
from the greater Synod to a lesser. Others thought it was necessary
he should immediately be sent away to make his answer, since it was
question of behaviour and manners only, and not of doctrine. In the
end it was concluded it should be left to his own discretion, to do as he
thought good. By this time were the Remonstrants of <hi>Utrecht</hi> ready
to shew their instructions, which they there openly produced, but to
no purpose at all. For all they could shew was this, that they had
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:114807:139"/>
commission to defend their cause, or to labour, at least for an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
or tolleration of it: but that they had power to pronounce deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sively
<hi>de veritate aut falsitate sententiae,</hi> that did not as yet appear.
The thing was acted with much altercation on both sides. At length it
was agreed, with some reluctancy on the Remonstrants party, that it
should be put to the determination of the Synod, whether they were to
be accounted as <hi>Judges,</hi> or only as <hi>citati.</hi> Some favourably thought
that their private instructions were not too narrowly to be sifted, but
if they would <hi>suo periculo</hi> take the oath, it should be sufficient. Others
thought that an oath was a greater matter then should so easily be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
although men did offer to take it, there being so good cause
of doubt, as now there was. Others examining there Credentiall let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
and the words of their private Commission, and finding no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
given them to define <hi>de falsitate sententiae,</hi> if it should appear to be false;
and that the lowest point they could descend unto, was a <hi>Tolleration,</hi>
concluded they could be no other then <hi>citati.</hi> As for their plea, that they
came to defend their opinion no otherwise then the Contra-Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants
did for theirs, it was replyed, first that they did the Synod wrong
to make this distinction of Contra-Remonstrants and Remonstrants: for
in the Synod there was no Contra-Remonstrant, and no man was call'd
thither under that name, whereas they in their letters came under the
name of Remonstrants. Again, No man came with charge to defend any
opinion, but were free to pronounce according to truth wheresoever it
should be, which was not their case. In the end the judgement of the
Synod was given up, that they could not be of the members of the
Synod in this cause (for in any other they might) but only as <hi>citati.</hi>
Yet notwithstanding that they might see the equity of the Synod to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them, it was permitted them to keep their places upon these
conditions: first if they would quit their defence of the cause; Secondly
if they would give no advise or counsel directly or indirectly to the <hi>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tati,</hi>
and by no means meddle with them in their cause: thirdly, that
they did not divulge any of the <hi>Acts</hi> and <hi>Secrets</hi> of the Synod (which
Clause was a meer Formality. For who can expect that that should not
be divulged, which is done in the sight of so many Spectators? Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
that they should not be troublesome to the Synod, by any intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stive
interpellations. This if they would promise, they should take the
Oath, and sit as Judges; otherwise, no. Unto this were they charged
immediately to give their answer. They again required respite. It was
answered, that this request was needless, the case being so plain, and
injurious to the Synod in detaining them from their business by fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous
delayes. They persisting still in their Suit, the thing again was
devolv'd unto the Synod, whether they should give their Answer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114807:139"/>
or have farther respite. It was concluded that they should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair
to Mr. <hi>Praeses</hi> the same day at five of the clock in the Evening,
there without farther delay, roundly to deliver their resolution.
Which thing yet they did not. They came indeed at the time appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but gave no Resolution, neither yet have done, for any thing I can
hear. And this was all was done that Session. I mervail much that the
Province of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> being the strength of the Remonstrants, could
finde no wiser men to handle their Cause. For as they did very fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishly
in bewraying their private instructions, so in this whole alterca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
did they not speak one wise word. This Session the Remonstrants
that were cited appeared not all.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Episcopius</hi> is reported to have put a trick upon the Seculars. For
whereas in his speech he had said some things concerning them, in that
Copie which was exhibited, sign'd with all their hands, there is no such
thing appears. He had committed it only to his Memory, as foreseeing
the Copie might be called for.</p>
                     <p>Mr. <hi>Praeses</hi> remembers his love and service to your Lordship, and hath
sent you a Copie of the Book which <hi>Adrian Smoutius</hi> dedicated to the
Synod. The greatest Newes, for ought I perceive, is, that it is dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
to the Synod; for else there is little that concerns them. I have
troubled your Lordship with very long repetition of a petit matter:
but it was all the argument of the <hi>Session.</hi> I trow, to morrow we shall
have other manner of stuff. And so ceasing to trouble your Lordship,
I humbly take my leave.</p>

                     <p>ON Munday the 10. of <hi>December, stylo novo,</hi> the Deputies met in the
morning, where the first thing determined, was the question as yet
depending concerning the Remonstrants of <hi>Utrecht.</hi> They had accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their appointment come to the <hi>Praeses</hi> and <hi>Assessors</hi> to give their
Answer, which was meerly dilatory, containing their answers to such
reasons as the Synod on the Saterday Session had brought to prove them
in the number of the <hi>Citati.</hi> But having better bethought themselves,
upon the Munday a little before the Morning Session, they delivered
their Resolution to the <hi>Praeses,</hi> to this effect, that since nothing else
would content the Synod, they had resolv'd to leave their place of
Judges, and to adjoyn themselves to the other Remonstrants which
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114807:140"/>
were cited: and so they did. After this fell in some speech concerning
a supplication lately exhibited by the Remonstrants unto the <hi>Exteri:</hi>
and because it seem'd to contein some aspersions against the Synod,
there was question made whether or no it should be publickly read and
stand: but this motion died, and there was nothing done in it. A Copie
of this Supplication, I think, my Lord Bishop lately sent your Honour.
Then Mr. <hi>Praeses</hi> signified unto the Synod, that without farther delay
he thought it fit, the Remonstrants should be put in minde of the end
of their coming, and that they should put up their mindes in writing,
concerning the five points in question, and that forthwith. For he
doubted it not, but they came very well provided to do it: and more,
that some years past, they had provided certain considerations to be at
hand, whensoever they should be called for, with which the World
was not yet acquainted. This thing he remembred <hi>Monsieur Barnevelt</hi>
sometime told him in private conference, and the Remonstrants them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
have told the World as much in their <hi>pressior declaratio,</hi> which
they joyn'd to their Edition of the Conference at the <hi>Hague.</hi> Then
were the Remonstrants call'd in, and told, First of their indirect dealing,
in pretending themselves to have but one Copie of their Oration,
whereas it was known they had another, and in delivering up a broken
Copie: then of the end of their being convented by the Synod. But
by the way one thing was urged somewhat unnecessarily. The Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants
had given up, (as I told your Honour) their speech signed
with all their hands. When those of <hi>Utrecht</hi> had joyn'd themselves unto
them, they were urged to put to their hands also: to which they reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they had not as yet read it. Here <hi>Episcopius</hi> took occasion to clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of that impuration lately fastned upon him, that he had abused the
Delegates, in giving them a counterfeit copy of his speech: protesting
he was not so ill qualitied, as that in so great a matter, and that before
God and so grave a Congregation he would deal doubly, and dishonest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
that he never affirmed that he had one only Copie, but that he had
none fairly written; for he confest he had another, and that the reason
why he requested either the same Copie again, or at least a Transcript of
it, was, because there was some difference betwixt the two Copies, and
they had not yet perfectly compar'd them together. The <hi>Praeses</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered,
that what was laid to their Charge, was nothing else but that
which the Synod verily understood to have been done, and he thinks,
that if the Memories of those in the Synod were consulted with, they
would all confirm it. About this was there likely to have been some al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercation
farther, but the Secular <hi>Praeses</hi> will'd them to leave that and
pass to their business. Here <hi>Episcopius</hi> besought the Synod that he might
have leave to speak some things by way of Proeme ere they came to the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114807:140"/>
Action. It was at first denied him, but he did so earnestly intreat, that
at length he had leave to speak his minde: and so forthwith there was
recited <hi>è Scripto</hi> a long and tedious speech of two hours, at the least:
consisting of two general heads: First of Exceptions they had against
the Synod <hi>tanquam in judicem incompetentem:</hi> Secondly of a conceit
of their own, what manner of Synod they thought fit it should be,
which was to compose these controversies in hand. Their reasons of
Exceptions were many, and manifoldly amplified and confirmed: but
amongst them all there were two especially insisted upon. First, it was
against all equity and nature that the adverse party should be Judge:
the Synod was here the adverse party, and therefore they could not be
Judges. Secondly, those who had made an open Schism and Faction
in the Church, and had separated themselves from their brethren,
could not be their Judges: but of this Synod a great part were
Authors of Schism, and the rest Favourers and Abettors of it:
they could not therefore be their Judges. In the prosecution of which
Reason they did not spare very liberally to bestow on the Synod
the name of <hi>Schismatici &amp; Novatores,</hi> and <hi>schismatum Fautores,</hi> and
other goodly titles of the same nature. The second part of their Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was a meere <hi>Chimaera saltans in vacuo;</hi> a strange phancy of such a
Synod as never was, nor can be. I had thought to have taken an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract
of it, but the tediousness of it deterr'd me. I will give your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
a taste or two of it. There were but two wayes of instituting a
Synod for the ending of these quarrels. The first was, by seeking out
every where certain select men, who all this time of contention had
taken part with neither side; but kept themselves unpartial. Secondly,
if a Synod of such could not be found (as I think it could scarcely
be found in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> though the Sun it self should seek it)
then such a Synod should be framed, as in which should be an equal
number of both parties, each with their several <hi>Praeses</hi> and <hi>Assessors;</hi>
and they should debate the matter betwixt themselves: and if they
could not agree, (as it is likely they would not) what then, thought
I? shall they part as they came? No forsooth. The Civil Magistrate,
<hi>tanquam Deus è machina,</hi> he must come in, and prescribe the <hi>Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
from which neither party must appeal. Provided alwayes,
that he laboured onely for Accomodation, and not to determine
decisively for on part. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>. <hi>And so I awoke.</hi> Of the same
threed was the whole piece of their speech. When they had well and
throughly wearied their Auditory, they did that which we much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired;
they made an end. The <hi>Praeses</hi> made a brief answer to this effect.
For the point of Schism saith he, it is not yet fit time to discusse. But
when it should in the Synod be made plain what had been the receiv'd
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114807:141"/>
Doctrine of the Church, then it would appear who they were that had
made secession from it, and so were guilty of Schism. If you refuse us
because we are your Adversaries, whom would you have deputed as
Judges? your selves, or the Papists, or the Anabaptists, or the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines,
or some other faction in these Countries? Let us be Sscismaticks,
let us be Scribes and Pharisees, and worse; yet you may not deny this
Synod to be a lawful Synod. For first it was done by the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate
who had authority to do it. Secondly, such as were there were
deputed by the consent of the Provinces. Thirdly, they had all taken
their oaths to judge uprightly. This is enough to make us your Judges,
and common Charity should make you to hope we would judge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly:
at least it should make you resolve thus far, if we should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
truly, you would subscribe unto it, if otherwise you would pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
bear it. If you were in our places, so <hi>deputed,</hi> so <hi>sworn,</hi> and we
were to be judged by you, we were to do the like. Here followed some
wrangling to no great purpose, and so the Session ended.</p>
                     <p>The same day after dinner the Deputies met again; where first the
<hi>Praeses</hi> commended to the Synod the consideration of that reproachful
Name of <hi>Schism,</hi> which the Remonstrants did so openly and so often
brand them with. For it was <hi>Episcopius</hi> his <hi>palmarium argumentum,</hi> the
Synod was all either Schismaticks or favourers of them, and therefore
could not be their Judges. It was much that they should grow to that
boldness, as that openly they should call the Synod, the Seculars, the
chief Magistrate, yea the Prince of <hi>Orange</hi> himself, Schismaticks. For
what had formerly been done in the matter of Secession and Division of
Churches was done by their consent and approbation. He requir'd
therefore the Synod to deliver themselves what was to be done. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
spake diversly. <hi>Lydius</hi> of <hi>South Holland</hi> relating the story of what
had been done in the time of separation, clear'd them of Schism;
and shewed first, that the name of Schism was used craftily by them,
as for a reproach, so likewise for a farther end they had for themselves.
For a Schism is only a breach of Charity and peace of the Church,
the Doctrine remaining intire. If there were a separation by reason of
Doctrine Heretical (as here he thought there was) it was not to be call'd
a Scism. Now the Remonstrants did therefore use the name of Schism,
that they might perswade the world, that the difference was only in
certain points indifferent, in which it matter'd not which end went
forward, by this means to make their way open to a tolleration. Again,
the separation which was made, was made upon good reason. For they
were forced unto it by the Remonstrants violence, as in particular he
did shew. At length he and the rest of the Synod concluded, that they
should roundly be put in minde of their duty, and to speak more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectively
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:114807:141"/>
to the Synod. Upon this the Remonstrants being called in, the
<hi>Praeses</hi> signifyed what the Synod disliked in them, and what behaviour
it expected at their hands: and withall will'd them to attend the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
of the States. <hi>Episcopius</hi> would have answer'd, but he was
prohibited. Then immediately followed a decree of the States to this
purpose; that whereas the Remonstrants had hitherto made many
dilatory answers, to the injury both of the Eclesiasticks and Seculars,
it was decreed by them, that they should lay by all frivolous Excep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and dilatory answers, and forthwith proceed to set down their
minde concerning the <hi>Five Articles,</hi> for which end they were come to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
Then began <hi>Episcopius</hi> to purge himself, and declare, that in
the imputation of Schism they included not the Seculars, they only
charged the Eclesiasticks: and if the Seculars had a hand in it, they
medled not with that. The <hi>Praeses</hi> urged them to give their answer,
whether or no they would set down their mindes concerning the points
in controversy: they still excepted, that the Synod were not their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
Judges. The <hi>Praeses</hi> asked by whom they would be judged? they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed,
they would not answer this, it was sufficient that the Synod could
not be their Judges. They were will'd to remember they were <hi>Citati:</hi> they
replyed, <hi>Citatorum est excipere de competentia judicis.</hi> The <hi>Praeses</hi> of the
Seculars will'd them remember that they were Subjects; they replyed,
the Magistrate could not command their Consciences: being again
will'd to give their answer, whether or no they would exhibit their
mindes concerning the five Articles, they requir'd first to have their
exceptions answer'd; when no other answer would be given, they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist
them, and appointed that of the Synod two should be chosen De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates,
who should immediately go to them, and in the name of the
Synod warn them to lay by all other answers, and at the next Session
Categorically answer, whether they would exhibit their mindes
concerning the points in Controversy, or no: that so the Synod
might know what they had to do: and so they brake up: this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
therefore we look what will be done. And so for this time I humbly
take my leave, commending your Honour to Gods good Protection.</p>

                     <p>ON Thursday the 4/14. of Decemb. the Synod being sate, and repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
made, according to the custom, of what had past in the former
Session, the Remonstrants being called in were askt whether or no they
had set down in writing their opinion concerning the first Article.
Forthwith they exhibited to the Synod their opinion subscribed with
all their hands. The copie of this your Lordship shall receive here
with these letters. The paper being read, the <hi>Praeses</hi> askt them all one
by one whether this were their opinion, to which each man answered
affi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>atively. The Remonstrants being dismist the <hi>Praeses</hi> proposed to the
Synod, whether it were not fit that they should be sent for one by one
and examined singly as concerning their tenent. His reason was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
he understood that they made themselves an Antisynod, and
had among themselves ordained a <hi>Praeses,</hi> two Assessours, and two
Scribes according to the form of the Synod: and so they did all things
<hi>communi consensu</hi> like a little Synod: to this some answered that they
thought it fit: some that those only should be singled out who were
carried away with respect to their company, and if they were alone
would think and do otherwise: others thought it utterly unfit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
it might seem <hi>olere artificium aliquod,</hi> to savour of a trick, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
it best became the Synod to do all things <hi>candide &amp; syncere:</hi> others
would have no man examined alone but when all the rest were by: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
left it to the judgement of the <hi>Praeses</hi> to do as he thought good
when occasion served: which last sentence as it seemed stood good.
After this was there a generall exception against the manner in which
they had proposed their sentence: that they had done it <hi>confuse,
di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>tracte, &amp; obscure:</hi> that they had intermingled things impertinent and
belonging to other questions: that the most of their proposalls were
negatives what they did not hold, and not affirmatives what they did;
whereas their appearance there was to shew what they did hold, not
what they did not hold. And it was discovered that this their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
by negatives was, that they might take occasions to refute o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
opinions, and not to confirm their own; whereas by the decree of
the States they were call'd thither <hi>ut sententiam SUAM dilucidè, perspicuè
&amp;c. exponerent &amp; defenderent</hi> not that they should oppugne others. That
it had been their custom very liberally to examine other mens opinions
and to be sparing in confirming their own. That if they did refuse to deal
more plainly in expounding their mind, the Synod should take order
that the state of the question should be taken out of their books, especially
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:114807:142"/>
our of the <hi>Hague</hi> conference, and so they should be questioned whether
they would stand to it or no: that they did maintain amongst them an
implicite faith, and it was usuall with some of them, when they were
prest with any reason they could not put by, to answer that though
themselves could say little to it, yet such and such could say much,
which was enough for them. When all had spoken their pleasure, the
conclusion of the Synod was, that they must reform the manner of
propounding their mind: that they must give up their answer in affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matives,
as much as was possible: that this form of answer was not
according to the Decree of the States: and this was the effect of that
Session.</p>
                     <p>On Friday the 5/15 of Decemb. there was a short Session in the morning.
The matter propounded was, whether it were not fit that the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants should be required to give up their minds concerning all the five
points before the Synod proceeded to examine or determine any thing.
The reason was, the connexion of the points mutually one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
for which cause it was hard to determine of one, except their
mind in the rest were known. The Secular Lords and the Synod liked
well of the proposall. Those of <hi>Geneva</hi> thought it best to take their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
out of their books: to which the <hi>Praeses</hi> answer'd, that it could
not be, because they were call'd thither by their citatory. Letters to
propose and defend their own opinions. That they could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
of the Synod for calling on them thus at once to deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
For the Synod doubts not that they were provided, since them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
had long since given it out in their books and private speeches
that they were provided. The Remonstrants then being called in, were
told that it was the determination of the Synod that they should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
their opinions at once concerning the five points; and for this
they had given them time till Munday. For this would prove better
for the Synod and for themselves. Then that they should deliver
themselves in affirmatives as much as possibly might be. For by their
negatives they delivered not their own opinions, but diverted upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
The Confessions and Creeds had always been framed by affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;
thus or thus wee do believe; not by negatives. To this they
replied, <hi>Attendemus ad ea quae a Domino Praeside dicta sunt &amp; considerabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>
Then did the <hi>Praeses</hi> signifie that on the morrow there should be a
Latin sermon in the Synod house. <hi>Scultetus</hi> is the man that makes
it. And this is the effect of what was done at that time and so ceasing to
trouble your Lordship any farther at this time, I humbly take my leave, resting.</p>

                     <p>THe seventh of <hi>December, stylo novo,</hi> being Friday, in the morning the
Synod met; the first thing that was done, was the pronouncing the
Decree of the States concerning <hi>Grevinchovius</hi> and <hi>Goulartius</hi> to this
effect, That whereas the Remonstrants had petitioned to the States,
that <hi>Grevinchovius</hi> and <hi>Goulartius</hi> might be admitted into the Synod,
there to defend the Remonstrants Cause, the Lords for good causes
thought they neither ought, nor could grant it; yet thus much did
they graciously permit, that they might freely come in private, and
do them what help they could; and if they thought, that in any thing
they saw further into the Cause then their Brethren, they might have
leave to exhibit their minde in writing to the Synod. Provided, First,
that they had leave of the Synod so to do. Secondly, that they did
not seek any frivolous delayes: Thirdly, that they promis'd to submit
themselves to the Decree of the Synod: and last of all, that the Church
Censures respectively pass'd on <hi>Grevinchovius</hi> and <hi>Goulartius</hi> be not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced;
but stand still in their full force and vertue. This Decree was
consented unto by the whole Synod. Here the <hi>Praeses</hi> admonisht those of
<hi>Utrecht</hi> to provide themselves, and resolve what they would do; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they would profess themselves parties for the Remonstrants, or
keep their places, and sit as Judges; if they would express as parties,
then must they cease to be accounted part of the Synod, and be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
as <hi>Episcopius</hi> and the rest that were <hi>cited.</hi> They requir'd that
time might be given them to deliberate. The <hi>Praeses</hi> eagerly urged them
to give their resolute answer. They replyed it was a greater matter
then might so soon be dispatch't. So far they went, that at length they
fell on some warm words. For when two of the Remonstrants Deputies
by chance spake both at once, the <hi>Praeses</hi> admonisht them to speak <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destiùs
&amp; ornatiùs.</hi> For men here speak one by one, and not by pairs.
But here the Secular Deputies strook in, and thought fit they should
have time of respite till the morrow: yet so that in the mean time the
Synod should proceed: Then were the Remonstrants call'd in, and
the Decree of the States concerning <hi>Grevinchovius</hi> and <hi>Goulartius</hi> read
unto them: <hi>Episcopius</hi> standing up requir'd that a little time might be
granted to them to speak, and forthwith uttered an Oration, <hi>acrem sanè
&amp; animosam,</hi> and about which, by reason of some particulars in it,
there will grow some stirre. The effect of the Oration was this.</p>

                        <pb n="37" facs="tcp:114807:143"/>THat Religion was the chiefest note of a man; and we were more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished
by it from other Creatures, then by our Reason. That
their apparence before the Synod was, <hi>ut illam etiam Spartam ornarent,</hi>
that they might endeavour something for the preservation of the Purity of
Religion: That Religion was nothing else but a right Conceit and Worship
of God: That the Conceits concerning God are of two sorts; some abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
necessary, which were the grounds of all true Worship; in these to
erre might finally endanger a man; Some not absolutely necessary; and in
these sometimes without great danger men might mistake; That they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fcryed
many conceits passing in our Churches which could not stand with
the Goodness and Justice of God, with the use of the Sacramen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>s, with the
Duties of Christian men; These had given occasion to the Adversaries
abroad to accuse our Churches, and lay upon them many strange imputations,
That therefore their endeavour had been none other but to remove these
imputations, and to provide, as much as in them lay, that the Conceits of
some few might not pass for the general Doctrine of our Churches; But this
their endeavour had hitherunto had but ill success: And as in a diseased
body many times when Physick is administred, the humours which before
were quiet are now stirred, and hence the body proves more distempered:
so their endeavours to cure the Church had caused greater disorder, yet
in this had they not offended. For they labour'd to none other end, but that
the Church might not be traduced by reason of the private conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>s of some
of her Ministers. That in this behalf the world had been exceedingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed
against them: but this Envy they esteemed their <hi>Gloriam &amp; Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marium;</hi>
That for this they did not mean to forsake their Cause, and
were it so that they should lose the day, yet would they joy in it, and think
it glory enough, <hi>magnis ausis excedisse.</hi> That this their stirring was not

of Wit, as many of the common sort were perswaded, that out of this
conceit it was that they had been so exceedingly roughly dealt withall, yea
they might say <hi>soevitum fuisse</hi> against them, as against unnecessary Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vators

                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and by stealth, after this they brake out into open but false accusations,
and after this into wrath, into scoffing and bitterness, till at length <hi>effractis
moderationis repagulis,</hi> every one came with open mouth against them,
<hi>tanquam in publici odii victimas. [Here followed a grave and serious
invocation of Christ as a witness to the truth of what they said]</hi> True
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114807:144"/>
indeed it was, that in their Books many things were to be found amisse. For
a very hard matter they thought it for mindes exasperated <hi>semper rectum
clavem tenere.</hi> That for the setling of these things, there could but
three courses be thought of; either a National Synod, or a mutual Tollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of each others Opinions, or the Cession and Resignation of their Calling
and place in the Church. To quit them of their calling and to fly, this were
a note of the Hireling: as for a Synod, which they much desired, <hi>remora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bantur
qui minime debebant,</hi> and it was pretended that the condition of
the Times would not suffer it. There remains only a mutual Tolleration, of
the possibility of which alone they had hope. And for this end they did exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
approve of the Decreeof the States of <hi>Holland,</hi> and <hi>West-fryzeland,</hi>
which they thought confirmed by the examples of <hi>Beza</hi>'s dealing with some, of
their own dealing with the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> of the Advice of the King of <hi>Great
Brittain:</hi> But all this was labour lost; for there was a buzze and jealousie
spread in the heads of men, that under this larve, this whifling Suit of Tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration
there lay personated more dangerous designes: that behinde this,
<hi>tanquam post siparium,</hi> there lay intents of opening a way to the Profession
of all the ancient Heresies: and that the Remonstrants could <hi>pro tempore,
Conscientiaesuae imperare quod volunt,</hi> upon this began mens minds to be
alienated from them: which thing at length brake forth into Schism and open
Separation. Now began their books to be more narrowly inquir'd into, every
line, every phrase, every word and tittle to be stretcht to the uttermost, to prove
them Hereticks. Witness that late work, intituled <hi>Specimen Controversia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum
Belgicarum,</hi> whose Authors credit and good dealing had already in part
appeared, and hereafter farther would appear. That all Fundamental points
of Divinity they had preserved untouched. For they knew that there were
many things of which it is not lawful to dispute, and they abhorr'd from
that conceit of many men, who would believe nothing but what they were able
to give a Reason of. That what they questioned was only such a matter, which
for a long time had been, without danger, both <hi>pro</hi> and <hi>contra</hi> disputed of.
They thought it sufficient if the chief points of Religion remain unshaken.
That there had been always sundry Opinions even amongst the Fathers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
which yet had not broken out into separation of mindes, and breach
of Charity. That it was impossible for all wits to jump in one point. It was the
Judgement of <hi>Paraeus</hi> a great Divine, that the greatest cause of Contentions in
the Church was this, that the Schoolmens Conclusions, and Cathedral Decisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
had been receiv'd as Oracles, and Articles of Faith. That they were
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114807:144"/>
therefore unjustly charged with the bringing in of a Sceptick Theologie: They
sought for nothing else but for that liberty which is the mean betwixt servitude
and License. That now they appear'd before the Synod, whether as <hi>cited,</hi> or
otherwise, they were not careful. They had been present howsoever had it been
lawful. They requir'd the Forreigners not to judge of them as they had heard
abroad, but as they now should finde them. That they profess they oppose them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
first against those Conclusions concerning Predestination, which the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors

for the Five Articles so call'd have made a Separation, never expecting any
Synodical Sentence: Thirdly, against those who cast from them all those who in
some things dissent from them. And yet to raise the controversy greater, is the

the points for which we have contended. Give unto us that respect which your

part carry the right, what think you then of the Province of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> where
the greater parts are Remonstrants: From you doth the Schisme proceed,
First here in this Synod, by making so an unequal a choice of Deputies with
so small a number of Remonstrants. Secondly by proceeding against us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
not expecting a Synodal Decree, by cashiering and subjecting unto
Censures the chief Patrons of our Cause, <hi>eos apud quos sunt aquilae nostrae:</hi>
and peradventure, even at this very hour you proceed against some of ours
by suspending, discommuning, by expelling them from their Churches, &amp;c.

and broken notes could supply me; I suppose what Errors I have
committed by leaving out, misplacing, misrelating, Mr. <hi>Ames,</hi> when he
comes to your Honour will rectify, this and much more for an <hi>hours
space, he delivered with great grace of speech, and Oratorial gesture:</hi> The
<hi>Praeses</hi> signified unto him, that because there were in his speech many
things considerable, he was therefore to deliver the Copy of it: <hi>Episcopius</hi>
replyed, that he had none handsomely written, if the Synod would
have patience, he would cause a fair Transcript to be drawen for them;
But this excuse would not serve. Fair or foul deliver it up he must, and
so he did: The Deputies for the Politicks signified, that since there
were many things in it, which did as well concern the Seculars, as E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticks,
they were to give it up subscribed with all their hands:
which forthwith was done. Then did the <hi>Praeses</hi> tell them how much
they were beholding to the Synod, that had so patiently heard them,
notwithstanding that they had no leave granted them to speak, and that
they ought to have expected the Mandate of the Synod. To this <hi>Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius</hi>
replyes, that he had required leave before he began to speak; True,
said the <hi>Praeses,</hi> but you stayed not till leave was granted you; besides,
saith he, you are to know that no man may, no not of those that are the
members of the Synod, offer to declaim without leave first had, and
without manifesting the Argument and drift of his speech. After this
followed a <hi>Form of Oath</hi> prescribed by the States, which all the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Synod were to take, the Articles of it were these two, <q>
                           <hi>That
only the Word of God should be taken for their rule to end their questions,
and that they had no other purpose but the peace of the Church.</hi>
                        </q> First the
<hi>Praeses</hi> took his oath in this order, standing up in his place, he said, <hi>Ego
promitto coram Deo,</hi> (thus, and thus) <hi>ita propitius mihi sit Servator Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus.</hi>
Then the Provincials took every one in his order, standing in his
place, and pronouncing these words, <hi>Idem promitto coram Deo &amp; sancto
Servatore,</hi> only the Remonstrants Deputies of <hi>Utrecht</hi> took not the
Oath, because as yet they had not determined, whether they would
make themselves parties or Judges; After the Provincials did the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners
in order do the like, and so the Session ended. And with it I
think is time for me to end, and commend your Lordship to Gods good
Protection.</p>

                        </gap> of this present, the Synod being sate in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<hi>Scultetus</hi> made unto them a pious, and pathetical Sermon. In
the beginning he signified, first how it joyed him to speak unto them
<hi>Post eruditissimum virum Josephum Hallum, Decanum Wigorniae meritissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum.</hi>
Secondly, that he saw that day, that which his Majesty of <hi>Great
Brittain,</hi> and the Prince <hi>Elector</hi> his Master had so long desired to see,
namely a Synod gathered for the setling of the Churches peace in
these Countries. He took for his Theme the 122. <hi>Psalm. I rejoyced when
they said unto me, Let us go up unto the house of the Lord,</hi> and so forth unto
the end of the <hi>Psalm.</hi> Where first having shewed the occasion of this
Psalm, that it was the Removal and bringing of the Ark unto <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
he considered in the whole Psalm three things. First, that it was
<hi>Summum hominis gaudium,</hi> to see the Peace and flourishing of the Church;
which he shewed by many Reasons, and confirmed by the examples of
the Duke of <hi>Wittemberg,</hi> who at the Council held at <hi>Worms</hi> a hundred
and twenty years since, when others discoursed of many Priviledges
and conveniences of their Lordships and Territories, openly protested
it to be his greatest felicity, that he could <hi>in aperto campo, &amp; in sinu Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditorum
suorum dormire:</hi> and of <hi>Theodosius</hi> the Emperour, who at his
death did more comfort himself that he had been a Son of the Church,
then the Emperour of the World. Secondly, that it was <hi>Summum hominis
Votum</hi> to pray for the peace and flourishing of the Church: which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
by the examples of the Apostles and of Christ himself. Thirdly,
that it was <hi>Summum hominis studium</hi> to procure the peace of the Church<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>
where speaking of the present occasion, I am no Prophet (saith he) yet I
think I foresee, that the peace of the <hi>Belgick Churches</hi> would be a means
to settle the peace of other Churches. He therefore wisht that the States,
the Prince, the Delegates, would all propose unto themselves as their
end, the peace and flourishing of the Churches amongst them, as he
doubted not they did in calling this Synod. There was not in this Sermon
any Doctrinal point discust, nor any particular toucht, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ght mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister
Newes. It was only a Pathetical exhortation to all sorts, as much
as in them lay to procure the Churches peace. When he had done, the
<hi>Praeses</hi> publikely in the name of the Synod gave him thanks, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
himself to have been very much moved with his speeches. Besides
this there was nothing done that Session.</p>
                     <p>Upon Munday 7/17 of this present, the Synod coming together in the
Forenoon, there were two out of <hi>Wetteraw</hi> from the Counties of <hi>Nassau,
Bisterfeldius</hi> a Preacher, and <hi>Jo. Henricus Al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

in <hi>Herborne</hi> came as Deputies from the Churches in those parts,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:114807:146"/>
to be admitted as parts of the Synod. The Letters from the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
and then their Credential Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ters from their Churches first being
read, the Oath was read unto them, and they took it. Then did the
<hi>Praeses</hi> in the Name of the Synod welcom them, and told them the end
of their coming, and what these Churches expected at their hands
Then were the Remonstrants call'd in, and willed to declare their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
concerning the rest of the Articles: which they did at large, and
added some Apologies for their proceeding by Negatives (which I could
your Lordship formerly had been the Exception of the Synod against
the manner held by them in the first Article.) I will not give a brief of
what they then delivered, because I resolve to send your Lordship
the perfect Copy of it, as soon as I can come to copie it out. When they
had done the <hi>Praeses</hi> asked them, whether they were provided to deliver
up their Considerations concerning the Confession and Catechisme, for
the Synod expected it. They answered that they expected not the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
should call for them. The <hi>Praeses</hi> replyed, this could not excuse
them, for they had often told the world in their Books, that they had
<hi>paratam sylvam considerationum</hi> in that kinde: and that the Synod should
better judge of each part, when it had learned their opinion of the
whole. They requir'd leave to withdraw a little, and think of an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer.
In the mean time the <hi>Praeses</hi> proposed to the Synod, to consider
how well the Remonstrants had stood to the Decree of the Synod, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the proposal of their Tenents in Affirmatives, he thought
that they had offended more against it, and that purposely in bringing
their Apologie for so doing: in censuring the opinions of other
Churches for blasphemous, &amp;c. Howsoever it was their judgement that
they should propose their sentence in Negatives, yet they ought not
to have proposed, but to have submitted their judgement to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Synod. The Remonstrants returning, gave answer to this
effect: that though they might require time to give up their Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
yet they thought they were not bound to give them up, till the
five Articles were discust; since their Citatory Letters so ran, that first
the Articles, then their Consideration should come in place: that they
thought it some wrong done them to have this order now perverted.
The <hi>Praeses</hi> answered that no wrong was done them; for their Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
should not yet be sifted, till the five Articles were concluded.
And so the order in their Citatory Letters should be kept. That long
since in a Synod at <hi>Delpht</hi> they had promis'd to deliver them up in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial
Synod there, and therefore now after so many years they could
not be unprovided. Here the <hi>Praeses Politicus</hi> charged them to obey
their Decree, and to do as the <hi>Praeses</hi> and the Synod requir'd. The
<hi>Praeses Eclesiasticus</hi> then admonisht them, that they were not to accompt
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114807:146"/>
of themselves as a Colledg, and so still to give answers <hi>in commune,</hi> but
they must answer particularly every one for himself, and thereupon
he asked every of them in order, whether they had any such Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
or no: some answered they had, some that they had some few
of no great moment, some that their Considerations were not written
down, some that they had none at all. When the <hi>Praeses</hi> had said, <hi>jacta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
fuisse</hi> by them long since, that they had sundry Considerations
ready; <hi>Corvinus</hi> excepted against the word <hi>jactatum;</hi> the <hi>Praeses</hi> reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
He used not the word to disgrace them, but only as a Frequentative,
to signifie that they had often boasted of it. When some Litigation was
here fallen, <hi>Martinus Gregorii</hi> (one that sits close upon the Remonstrants
skirts) cut it off, and commanded them to be quiet. The Remonstrants
here signified, that such Considerations as they had were only in the
<hi>Dutch</hi> tongue. The <hi>Praeses</hi> replyed, they should have leasure to translate
them. Then did the Seculars pronounce a Decree charging them to
provide themselves singly one by one, he that had many to give up ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
he that had few to give up few, he that had none to give up none,
and that whether it were in Dutch or Latine. The Remonstrants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
some time; for, saith <hi>Episcopius,</hi> we came <hi>imparatissimi ad hanc
rem.</hi> First there were given them to two dayes, then three, then four:
within which space every man alone by himself, was to give up his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations:
and this was the effect of the Session.</p>

the Post came to <hi>Dort</hi> on Sunday about three of the clock, and went

<hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Worcester</hi> is very crazy and sickly of late, and keeps his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
neither hath he been in the Synod some of these last Sessions. I
hear he purposes to come to the <hi>Hague,</hi> to see if he shall have his health
better there. Here is a Rumour that the Remonstrants are a little di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
amongst themselves; and that <hi>Corvinus</hi> complains that what he
hath done, was because he suffered himself to be drawn on by others,
how true this is I know not; I heard <hi>Scultetus</hi> tell my Lord Bishop so
much, and that <hi>Meierus</hi> of <hi>Basil,</hi> should say that <hi>Corvinus</hi> had signified so
much to him. My Lord Bishop is a little displeased with Mr. <hi>Amyes</hi> for
putting into his hand <hi>Grevinchovius</hi> his Book, in the Preface of which
there are cited out of a Writing of Mr. <hi>Amyes</hi> certain words very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful

                     <p>ON Thursday 10/20 of this present, in the morning the Synod being
met, the first thing done was the Admission of the <hi>Scotish</hi> Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in this manner. He was brought to the Synod House by the two
Scribes, and met at the door by two of the Deputies for the States,
and by them conducted to his Seat, which is a little seat made under
the <hi>English</hi> Seats, where he sits alone; when he was sate the <hi>Praeses</hi> wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>com'd
him in the Name of the Synod. Then were the Letters from the
States read, which were to stand instead of Synodical Letters; for
otherwise the custom is here, that he that comes to be a Member of the
Synod brings Letters of Credence from the Church that deputes him.
After this he delivered himself in a short speech to this effect. <q>That
the reason of his coming he had delivered unto the States at the
<hi>Hague,</hi> namely the Kings pleasure: that he therefore once minded
to have said nothing, but he could not obtain so much of himself,
especially when he heard what gentle Welcome the <hi>Praeses</hi> gave
him, and he was desirous to shew himself thankful for such great
Courtesie; That the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation had evermore so linkt it self to
this people, that it hath alwayes laboured to endeavour the peace of
this State, and now it was ready to do as much for the peace of
the Churches amongst them. That they had very straightly bound
unto them the <hi>Scotish</hi> Church (<hi>demeruistis Eclesiam Scoticanam</hi>) by
this so kindly welcoming him. That his years were not many, but he
hoped ere he departed to make amends for that; That the King at his
coming away did charge him, <hi>verbis sublimibus, above all sphere of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
and apprehension</hi> to exhort them unto peace, and with a short
passage to that purpose he ended.</q> The <hi>Praeses</hi> thanking him for his
good Counsel gave him his Oath. And so they past away to other
business.</p>
                     <p>Tomorrow I trowe we shall have more matter, for then the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants
are to give in their Exceptions, against the Catechisme and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,
and so at length we shall come to the Question. For this time
therefore I humbly take my leave of your Honour, resting</p>

                     <p>UPon Thursday the 17/27 of this present, the Deputies being met in the
morning, the Remonstrants were called in, and willed to give up
their Considerations upon the Catechism, according to the injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
laid on them on Friday last. <hi>Episcopius, Corvinus, Duinghonius, Poppius,
Pinakerus</hi> and <hi>Sapma</hi> gave up altogether in common, and excused them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
for not giving up one by one, as was enjoind them, because their
Considerations being altogether the same, they thought they might
exhibit them altogether; <hi>Niellius, Goswinus, Matthisius,</hi> and <hi>Isaacus
Frederici,</hi> gave up singly, every one by himself, the rest gave up none
at all. What these Considerations were I know not; for they were
not publisht. Then did the <hi>Praeses</hi> require them <hi>coram Deo</hi> to answer di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
and truly, First whether or no these were the Observations which
they gave up to the States of <hi>Holland;</hi> to which was answer'd, that as
far as they could remember they were, and some others besides. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
whether they had any more Considerations besides these; to which
they all answered, No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> Here <hi>Scultetus</hi> stood up, and in the name of the
<hi>Palatine</hi> Churches, required a Copie of these Considerations upon the
Catechism. We have saith he a command from our Prince to see that
nothing be done in prejudice of our Churches. The Catechism is ours
known by the name of the <hi>Palatine Catechism,</hi> and from us you receiv'd
it. The Observations therefore upon it concern us, we require there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
a draught of them, with purpose to answer them, and submit our
answer to the judgement of the Synod. This request of the <hi>Palatines</hi>
was thought very reasonable. These Considerations (I speak of those
on the Confession; for those others I saw not) are nothing else but
<hi>Queries</hi> upon some passages of the Confession, of little or no moment:
so that it seems a wonder unto many, how these men, which for so many
years past, in so many of their Books, have threatned the Churches
with such wonderful discoveries of falshood and error in their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
and Catechism, should at last produce such poor impertinent stuff.
There is not, I perswade my self, any writing in the world, against which
wits disposed to wrangle cannot take abundance of such exceptions.
After this did the <hi>Praeses</hi> put the Remonstrants in minde of the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Synod past upon the manner of propounding their
<hi>Theses</hi> on the Articles. Two things there were misliked. First their
propounding so many Negatives. Secondly, their urging so much to
handle the point of Reprobation, and that in the first place; whereas
the Synod requir'd they should deliver themselves, as much as was
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114807:148"/>
possible in Affirmatives, and begin first from Election, and from thence
come to the point of Reprobation in its due place. He required them
therefore to signifie whether they would follow the Judgement of the
Synod, or their own. They answered, that they had given up their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
to justifie their proceeding, and otherwise to proceed their <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi>
would not permit them. For, saith <hi>Episcopius,</hi> the point of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
is that <hi>quod maximè nos aegrè habet:</hi> that he could not endure
that Doctrine concerning the absolute Decree of God; <hi>that God should
peremptorily decree to cast the greatest part of mankinde away, only because
be would. Corvinus</hi> answer'd, that he could not <hi>salvâ Conscientiâ versari
in Ministerio,</hi> till that point were clear'd. <hi>Isaacus Frederici,</hi> that <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>m
momentum</hi> was in that question: others, that in the question of
Election they had no seruple; all their doubt was in the point of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation:
and therefore their Conscience would not suffer them
to proceed farther in disputation, till that matter were discust. To
this answer was made, that the Synod did not refuse to handle the
matter of Reprobation, but thought it not fit to have it done in the
first place. But when this would not content them, the <hi>Praeses</hi> proposed
unto them, whether they were resolv'd so to proceed, or else to relinquish
all farther disputation. They replied, they resolved to break of all
farther Treaty, if that matter might not be handled. It was told them,
that it should be treated of in its due place, but the question was only
<hi>de modo procedendi,</hi> whether they should handle that first or no. <hi>Episcopius</hi>
and some others of them gave answer, that for the order they did not
precisely stand upon, <hi>mode de tota re agatur:</hi> but this answer they stood
not unto. For when the <hi>Praeses</hi> told them again, that it was the pleasure
of the Synod, first to handle of Election, and then of Reprobation as
much as should seem necessary, and for the Churches good, and withall
charged them to answer roundly and Categorically whether they
would proceed according to this order: they answered, No. Then did
the <hi>Praeses</hi> require them to withdraw, and give the Synod leave to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise
of this: The sum of that which past in the mean time was this:
That their pretence of Conscience was vain, since it was not of any
thing which concern'd Faith or good manners, but only of order and
method in disputing, which could not at all concern the Conscience; that
the Disputation must begin from Election. First because the order of
Nature so requir'd, to deal of the Affirmative before the Negative; and
again, because that all Divines, who ever handled this Question, did
hold the same order; and the Holy Ghost in Scripture had taken the
same course. That they should be assured in the name of the Synod,
that they should have Liberty to diseusse the question of Predestination
throughout. That whatsoever they pretended, yet the true end of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:114807:148"/>
their so hotly urging the question of Reprobation, was only to exagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the Contra-Remonstrants Doctrine, and to make way for their own
Doctrine in point of Election: <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>dius</hi> observed, that it had been the
Custome of all those who favour'd <hi>Pelagianism,</hi> to trouble the Church,
with the question of Reprobation. <q>
                           <hi>D. Gomarus</hi> that saw that his Iron
was in the fire, (for I perswade my self that the Remonstrants spleen is
chiefly against him) began to tell us, that <hi>Episcopius</hi> had falsified the
Tenent of Reprobation: that no man taught that God absolutely
decreed to cast man away without sin: but as he did decree the end,
so he did decree the means: that is, as he predestinated man to death,
so he predestinated him to sin, the only way to death: and so he
mended the question, as <hi>Tinkers mend Kettles,</hi> and made it worse then
it was before.</q> In summe the Synod caused a Decree to be penn'd to
this purpose. <hi>That it should be lawful for the Remonstrants to propose their
Doubts, both in the Question of Election, and of Reprobation: but for the
order in disputation, which of the two should come first, they should leave that
to the Synod, who thought it fitter to give, then to receive Laws; and that
whereas they pretended Conscience, it was but vain, since there was nothing
in Scripture against this Command of the Synod; nay that it was more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
with Conscience to obey then to withstand.</hi> Then were the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants
called in, and after a short admonission better to advise them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
the Decree of the Synod was read unto them. And when they
began to urge their Conscience, the <hi>Praeses Poliricus</hi> spake to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose:
that there had heretofore been many Decrees made by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates,
but they had been all neglected, he therefore strictly warn'd
them, that no man should dare to withstand any Decree either of the
Magistrate, or of the Synod, either by open opposing against it, or by
sullen silence, under pain of penalty according to the will of the Lords.
When <hi>Episcopius</hi> had said <hi>aegerimè ferimus,</hi> and would have said some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more, he was enjoyn'd silence, and so the Session ended, Mr. <hi>Praeses</hi>
telling us, that the next Session we should come to the question, <hi>si per

                        </gap> of <hi>Decemb.</hi> in the morning it was long ere the Synod
met. At length being come together, there were read the two De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees;
one of the States, another of the Synod, made the former Session:
the reason of the repeating was the absence of some the day before. Then
did the <hi>Praeses</hi> signify, that that very morning, immediately before the
time of the Synod, he had received from the Remonstrants Letters <hi>satis
prolix<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>s,</hi> which concern'd himself and the whole Synod; the perusal
of which Letters was the cause of his long stay. The Letters were sent to
the Secular Delegates to know whether or no they would have them
read. Whilst the Seculars were advising of this point, there were
brought in a great heap of the Remonstrants Books, and laid upon the
Table before the <hi>Praeses:</hi> for what end it will appear by and by. The
Secular Delegates signifie, that they think not fit that the Letters should
be publickly read, and that the Remonstrants should immediately be
call'd in. They being entred, the <hi>Praeses</hi> askt them whether they were
ready to obey the Orders set down by the States and the Synod: They
require to have their Letters read: but the Seculars willed them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of reading their Letters, to hearken to a Decree of the States, and
forthwith was read a Decree sounding to this purpose: that the States
strictly commanded, that nothing should be read or spoken in the Synod
in prejudice of the Decree made yesterday; but that they should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any further delay come to the business in hand. The Remonstrants
reply, that except they may most freely propose their mindes in both
the parts of Predestination, both Election and Reprobation they refused
to go further in Conference, for that their <hi>Conscience</hi> would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them. The <hi>Praeses</hi> replyed, that for Liberty of proposal of their
opinions they could not complain; for the Synod had given them <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertatem
Christianam, aequam, justam:</hi> but such an absolute Liberty as
they seemed to require, of going as far as they list, of oppugning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Synod what opinions they pleased of learned men, this they
thought unfit. And as for Conscience, they knew that the Word of
God was the rule of it. Now what part of Scripture had they that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
them in this behalf, or that did take any order and prescribe a
Method in Disputation. By thus stiffely urging their Conscience they
did exceedingly wrong the Decrees of the States and Synod, as if by
them something against the Word of God, some impiety were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.
When the <hi>Praeses</hi> had thus said, he began to propose unto them
certain Interrogatories concerning the Five Articles. Your Honour
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:114807:149"/>
may be pleased to call to minde, that in one of my former Letters I
shewed, that because the Remonstrants had given up their opinions very
perplexedly and imperfectly, the Synod had thought good that the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi>
should propose them certain questions out of their own Writings, so
the better to wrest their meaning from them. This was the <hi>Praeses</hi> now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
to do; and this was the cause of the bringing in of the Books.
The Interrogatory proposed was this, Whether or no they did acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that the Articles exhibited in the <hi>Hague Conference</hi> did contein
their opinions? <hi>Episcopius</hi> stept up, and required that it might be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
for them to set down their own Tenents, and not be forced to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
thus to other mens Writings. <hi>H. Leo</hi> in choler told the <hi>Praeses,</hi> that
he did evidently see, that it was the drift of the Synod, to discredit
them with the Magistrate, and that for his own part he would rather
leave his Ministry, then make any answer to these Interrogatories. The
<hi>Praeses</hi> here advised him to bethink himself seriously, whether his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
could assure him that this was a good cause of leaving his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry;
because he might not proceed in Disputation according as he
thought fit. <hi>Wezekius</hi> answer'd, that he would not submit himself to
this <hi>examen,</hi> and, <hi>nisi posset liberrimè agi,</hi> he would not answer at all.
The same was the sence of <hi>Hollingerus</hi> his answer. <hi>Episcopius</hi> plainly
told them, <hi>nisi in omnibus liberum esset</hi> to do as they thought good, they
would go no farther. For we are resolv'd, saith he, <hi>agere pre judicio no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stro,
non pro judicio Synodi:</hi> then one of the Seculars stept up, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
those words should be noted. The <hi>Praeses</hi> then told them, that the true
cause of all this their indisposition was, that they forgot themselves to
be <hi>Citati,</hi> and that they were not acquainted with being commanded.
They were to remember, that they stood before God, before their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate,
and that their cause was the cause of the Church, whose peace
would not be procured by this behaviour. They might remember what
they told the Forreign Divines in their Letters to them, that there was
of late a great <hi>Metamorphosis</hi> in the State. <hi>Non estis nunc judices &amp; Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini
rerum, sed Citati:</hi> but as it seem'd, they were resolv'd to suffer,
<hi>omnino nullum judicium de iis fieri. Episcopius</hi> here urged his Conscience.
<hi>Adde Verbum Dei</hi> then saith the <hi>Praeses,</hi> shew us upon what Text of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
you ground your Conscience, otherwise you wrong both the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate
and the Synod. <hi>Corvinus</hi> answered, that that scantling of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty,
which the Synod gave them, did not suffice their Consciences.
<hi>Poppius</hi> likewise required larger Liberty, and that he might not be
dealt withall by Authority, but by Reason. The <hi>Praeses</hi> answered, that
in Conscience he could not give them greater Liberty, then they had
already given them, and therefore askt him if he would answer to the
Interrogatories. He stoutly replyed, <hi>Malo quidvis pati. Sapma</hi> replyed
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:114807:150"/>
to the same purpose, and over and above added, <hi>Ut nostrum judicium
non satisfacit Synodo, ita nec Synodi Judicium nostro. Rickwardius</hi> told
the Synod, that they dealt not charitably with them, and openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested,
as <hi>Episcopius</hi> had before done, <hi>non agemus pro judicio Synodi, sed pro
judicio nostro.</hi> The <hi>Praeses</hi> replyed, <hi>vocem hanc esse intollerandam. Niellius</hi>
excepted against this proceeding with them <hi>capitatim,</hi> and requir'd that
they might consult in common what answer to give. For my self, saith
he, I am a man of no ready speech, and unfit for sudden disputation.
Too great advantage is taken against men, by this kinde of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
Many members of the Synod, were they thus singled out to give
a sudden answer, might easily peradventure be put to some distress.
<hi>Nullam esse causam tam justam, de qua non facile possit triumphari, si de ea
agatur tantum pro arbitrio adversarii.</hi> The <hi>Praeses</hi> told them that here
was nothing requir'd, but that they would give a reason of their Faith,
which they had for this many years taught in their Pulpits, &amp; in their
Writings, &amp; therefore they could not be unprovided to give an answer;
and for that they mentioned the Synod as an Adversary, they had been
already taught sufficiently by the Forreign Divines that the Synod
could not be counted <hi>pars adversa:</hi> they answer'd, that they requir'd
a copie of the reasons given by the Forreign Divines, that they might
consider of them; but they were denyed it. Here was by one of them,
I know not whom, a reply made, that the Remonstrants in refusing to
proceed except they might freely handle the point of Reprobation,
did no other then the Contra-Remonstrants had formerly done in the
<hi>Hague Cenference,</hi> who there openly refused to proceed, if they were
urged to have the same point handled; notwithstanding the command
of the Magistrate. <hi>Festus Hommius</hi> replyed, that the narration was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sified;
for the Contra-Remonstrants did not simply refuse to deal in the
point of Reprobation; neither did the Magistrate command them to
do it, as now he had commanded them. And thus much did some of the
Secular Deputies stand up and give witness unto. <hi>Episcopius</hi> here urged
some words out of the Conference, to prove what was said; but what
these words were I could not take. The <hi>Praeses</hi> went forward to propose
the Interrogatories: <hi>Goswinus</hi> and <hi>Neranus</hi> answer'd as their fellows
had formerly done. <hi>Isaacus Frederici</hi> urged for himself, that when he
was removed from being a Member of the Synod, he was commanded
<hi>conjungere se Citatis:</hi> this he could not do, if thus he was enforced to
answer for himself alone. The <hi>Praeses</hi> answered, that by the Decree of
the States they were accounted no Colledg; but only as they were
cited, so were they to answer <hi>Capitatim</hi> and by Poll. And as for <hi>Isaacus,</hi>
since he knew that the Synod accounted of him as of one of the <hi>Citati,</hi>
he could not be ignorant that his quality was the same with theirs.
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:114807:150"/>
                        <hi>Isaacus</hi> answer'd that he had evermore been averse from sudden dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
and therefore he meant not to answer. Here it was denyed by
some of the Remonstrants, that the States had made any Decree that
they should thus give answer <hi>capitatim.</hi> The Delegates for the Seculars
stood up, and signified <hi>viva voce,</hi> that they had decreed it. <hi>Episcopius</hi>
answer'd, that the Scribe (<hi>Heinsius</hi>) used some such words, but he took
it to have been only some phrase of <hi>Heinsius,</hi> not any Decree of the
Lords. <hi>Heinsius</hi> replyed that he did nothing but what he was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<hi>Episcopius</hi> protested, that till that hour he never heard that by any
Decree of the States they were enjoyn'd to answer thus singly, and by
Poll. <hi>Poppius</hi> signifyed that he thought it a thing very unbefitting both
his age and his Ministry, to submit himself to such a <hi>Pedagogica collatio,</hi>
as sometimes by <hi>Martinus Gregorii</hi> it had been styled. The <hi>Praeses</hi> then
askt them all in general, whether they did persist in this their Answer.
They all replyed, <hi>Yea.</hi> The Remonstrants therefore being dismist, the
<hi>Praeses</hi> required the Synod to think what course they would take to
proceed, protesting that he thought that all Liberty befitting was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
them: and calling in the Remonstrants again, and advising them
to consider what they did: they all replyed, that they were resolv'd,
<hi>non capitatim, sed conjunctim respondere.</hi> The President of the Politicks
commanded them, that without peculiar leave granted, none of them
should go out of the Town. The <hi>Praeses Eclesiasticus</hi> advising the Synod
to think of some course of gathering the Remonstrants opinions out of
their Books, since they could not get them from themselves, dismist the
Company.</p>
                     <p>The same day after dinner was there a Session, but very private, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was any stranger permitted to be there. Wherefore a Relation of
that Session I must give only upon hearsay. Which I would now have
done, but that I hasten to the Session this morning. And I understand
that the Synod will dispatch some of their Company to the States Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,
to signify how matters stand, and to know their further plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure.
I will here therefore shut up my Letters, reserving the rest of the
News till the next occasion, and commending your Honour to Gods
good Protection I humbly take my leave.</p>

                     <p>THe State of our Synod now suffers a great <hi>crisis,</hi> and one way or
other there must be an alteration. For either the Remonstrant
must yeeld, and submit himself to the Synod, of which I see no great
probability: or else, the Synod must vail to them, which to do, far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then it hath already done, I see not how it can stand with their Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
How the case stood at the last Friday Session, your Honor may
perceive by my letters written upon Saterday. Three things there
were mainly urged by the Synod, and as mainly withstood by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants.
The first was the point of order to be held in discussing
the articles: whether the question of Reprobation were to be handled
after the five articles, as the Synod would have had it, because it is
none of the five points, and by order from the States nothing ought to
be determined of till the five be discust: or whether it should be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in the first place, as the Remonstrants would have it, because, as
they pretended, their doubts lay especially there, and that being clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
they thought they should shew good conformity in the rest. The
second thing, was the putting of interrogatories, which thing they
much disdain'd as Predagogicall. Third was the Liberty of disputation
which was to be given the Remonstrant, whether it were to be limited
and circumscribed by the discretion of the Synod, or large and unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
accordingly as it pleas'd the Remonstrants. So strongly in these
points did the Remonstrants withstand the Synod, that on Friday last
it was verily thought they would have gone their way, and left the
Commissioners to determine without them. But the Synod bearing
an inclination to peace, and wisely considering the nature of their Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, resolved yet further, though they had yielded sufficiently unto
them already, yet to trie a little more, the rather to stay the clamour of
the Country, and cut off all suspicion of Partiall dealing. And for this
purpose call'd a private Session on Friday in the Evening, to mollify
some things in thein Decrees and Proceedings. From that Session all
Strangers were excluded, and what I write, I do only upon Relation.
The summ of it was this. The <hi>Praeses</hi> much complain'd him of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity
he was in, by reason of the Pertinacy of the Remonstrants.
For, saith he, if we labor to keep them here, they will be but a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance
to us, as hitherto they have been, if we dismiss them, we shall
hazard our credit among the People, as if we purposed only to do what
we please. Whatsoever it is that here we do, is by some that come hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
and write all they hear, presently eliminated, and carryed to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:114807:151"/>
them which hath caused many hard, reports to pass of us, both with
them and otherwhere. He therefore commended to the Synod to
consider whether there might not be found some means of accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which might somewhat mollify the Remonstrant, and yet stand
well with the Honour of the Synod. And first, to make way, they read
the Letters which in the morning by publick Decree, of the States
were forbidden to be read (<hi>a pretty matter in so grave a place, to break those
edicts in the Evening, which but in the Morning had been so solemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed</hi>)
and to speak truth, their Decrees, have hitherto been mere mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of formality to affright them a little, for none of them have been
kept; as being found to be Pouder without Shot, and give a clap, but do
no harme.) The Letters being read they began to deliver their minds.
Some thought the Synod had been too favourable to the Remonstrants
already, and that it were best now not to hold them if they would be
going, since hitherto they had been, and for any thing appeared to
the contrary, meant hereafter to be a hindrance to all Peacable and
orderly proceedings. Others on the contrary thought fit that all should
be granted them which they required, to su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>cease the Interrogatories,
to let them speak of Reprobation in what place, in what manner, and
how much they pleased, since this took from them all pretence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
and Prejudiced not the Synods power of determining what
they pleased. A third sort thought it better to hold a middle course
and under colour of Explanation, to mollifie some of their Decrees.
This sort prevailed, and accordingly it was concluded that the Decree
of the Synod (of this decree I gave your Honor the summ in my Satter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
Letters) made in the Morrning, should be more largely and Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficantly
drawne, and withall in it should be exprest how far it pleased
the Synod to be indulgent unto the Remonstrants in the points in
Question. The Forraign Divines were requested, that they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
some Reasons by way of Answer to these late Exceptions of the
Remonstrants, and give them up in writing the next Session, to try
whether by these means they might make them a little to relent. This
is all was done that Session, which though it seem but little, yet being
handled with much and long Speaking among so many, took up a long
time,</p>
                     <p>On Munday the 21/31 of Decemb. in the Morning the Synod being set
<hi>Johannes Polyander</hi> made a Latin Sermon. His Theme was the seventh
verse of the two and fiftieth of Isaiah. <hi>O quam specioc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

he spake much of the greatness of Eclesiasticall Function; First in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
of their dignity in the word <hi>Speciosi,</hi> Secondly of their industry,
in the word <hi>Montibus,</hi> which argues them either to be <hi>Pastores</hi> or <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatores;</hi>
Thirdly of the suavity of their Doctrine in the word <hi>Peace</hi>
                        <pb n="54" facs="tcp:114807:152"/>
and <hi>Good things;</hi> After this he fell Pathetically to bewail the torne
State of the <hi>Belgick</hi> Churches: and to commend the diligence of the
Synod in endeavouring to establish their Churches Peace. This was
the sum of his Sermon, it being only a passionate strain, and contein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing much Remarkable either for Doctrine or News. The
<hi>Praeses</hi> in the Name of the Synod gave him great thanks: and signified

                     <p>Concerning <hi>Monsieur Moulins</hi> proposition of which your Honor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired my opinion, thus I think, His project consists of two heads, of
a Generall Confession, and of a peaceable treaty for Union with the
<hi>Lutheran</hi> Churches. I imagine that the Generallity of the Confessions
must not include the <hi>Lutheran.</hi> For if it doth, then are both parts of
his proposition the same: it being the same thing to procure one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Confession of Faith and a Union. Supposing then that this Confessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
stretches not to them, I will do as <hi>Jupiter</hi> doth in <hi>Homer,</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.
I will grant him one part, and deny
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>him the other. For a generall Confession of Faith, at least so farr as
those Churches stretch who have Delegates here in the Synod, I think
his project very possible, there being no point of Faith in which they
differ. If therefore the Churches shall give power to their Delegates,
to propose it to the Synod, I see no reason but it should pass. But I did
not like the intimation concerning Church-Goverment. It had I think
been better not mentioned: not that I think it possible that all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
can be Govern'd alike (for the <hi>French</hi> Church being <hi>sub cruce</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
well set up Episcopall jurisdiction) but because it may seem to his
Majesty of Great <hi>Brittain,</hi> that his excepting the point of Government
might not proceed so much from the Consideration of the Impossibility
of the thing, as from want of love and liking of it in the Person. Now
for that part of the proposition which concerns the <hi>Lutheran,</hi> either it
aimes at a Union in Opinion or a mutuall tolleration. The first is
without all question impossible. For in the point of the Sacrament and
the dependences from it, as the ubiquity of <hi>Christs</hi> manhood, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
of <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>communicatio idiomatum, &amp;c.</hi> Either they must yield
to us, or we to them, neither of which probable. Their opinions have
now obtein'd for a Hundred years, ever since the beginning of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
and are derived from the chief Author of the Reformation.
It is not likely therefore that they will easily fall, that have such Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and so many years to uphold them. But I suppose, <hi>Monsieur
Moulins</hi> intended only a mutuall tolleration; and be it no more, yet if
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:114807:152"/>
we consider the indisposition of the persons with whom we are to deal,
I take this likewise to be impossible. The <hi>Lutherans</hi> are divided into
two sorts, either they are <hi>Molliores,</hi> as they call them, or <hi>Rigidi</hi>
What hope there may be of moderation in the first I know not, but in
the second we may well despair of. For they so bear themselves, as
that it is evident they would rather agree with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> then
with the <hi>Calvinist.</hi> He that is conversant in the writings of <hi>Hunnius</hi>
and <hi>Grawer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>s,</hi> will quickly think as I do. The first of which hath so
bitterly written against <hi>Calvin,</hi> that <hi>Parsons</hi> the Jesuit furnisht himself
by compiling <hi>Hunnius</hi> his Books. If the whole lump be Leaven'd,
as those two pieces, which I but now named, they are certainly too
sower for moderate men to deal with. The French wits are naturally
active and projecting; and withall carry evermore a favourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit
to the possibility of their projects. Out of this French conceit I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
proceeded this of M. <hi>Moulins.</hi>

                     <p>WHat hath lately been done at the <hi>Hague</hi> in the business concerning
our Synod, and what Decree the States have made to restrain
the exorbitancy of the Remonstrants, I suppose is sufficiently known
unto your Lordship, as a thing done in your presence. So much thereof it
as shall serve the present purpose I will take, and leave the rest to your,
Honors better knowledg. Upon Thursday the third of <hi>January, stylo
novo,</hi> the Commissioners being met, and the Delegates ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
the pleasure of the States, the Remonstrants being call'd in, two
of them were found wanting, <hi>Isaacus Friderici,</hi> and <hi>Henricus Leo:</hi> for
<hi>Isaacus</hi> it was answered, that he had leave on Friday last, of the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi>
of the Town to go abroad: for <hi>Leo</hi> it was answered, that they
knew not where he was. Having sent for <hi>Leo,</hi> and awhile in vain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
him, the Delegates proceeded to declare the will of the Lords,
and signified that the States allowed the Proceedings of the Synod, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114807:153"/>
commanded the Remonstrants to obey for the present, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
Decrees hereafter the Delegates and Synod should enact; and if
they refused to obey, they should expect both Civill and Eclesiasticall
censure. If this served not, yet the Synod should go forward, and
gather their opinions out of their books and writings; That the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants
should be commanded to remain in the Town, and be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to appear whensoever the Synod should summon them, and answer
plainly and directly to such Interrogatoryes as it should please the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
to propose them. This first was read in Dutch, and afterwards
for the information of the Forreigners it was put into Latin. The
<hi>Praeses</hi> then put to them that Question, which in one of the former Sessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
he had proposed, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether or no they did acknowledg the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
set down in the <hi>Hague</hi> Conference to contein their opinions, and
amongst the rest, that first concerning Election, which by the Scribe was
read unto them out of the Book. <hi>Episcopius</hi> beginning to make answer,
<hi>Martinus Gregorii</hi> commanded that their answers should be taken and
set down in their own words. <hi>Episcopius</hi> his answer was this. <hi>Omnibus in
timore Domini expensis, &amp; adjunctis etiam ad Deum precibus, non possum
impetrare ab anima mea, ut aliam agendi rationem sequar, quam eam quae
ultimo responso meo exhibita est.</hi> This their answer, of which he speaks, was
given on Saturday last, as I have inform'd your Honor, and it was this,
that except the Synod <hi>in antecessum,</hi> as they spake, would beforehand
promise them, that they should have free Liberty to propose their own
opinion of Reprobation, and refute the Contra-Remonstrants Doctrine
in that point together with the Doctrine if all those whom the Contra-remonstrants
held for Orthodox, and that as far as they pleas'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
receiving any check from the Synod, they were resolved to go no
further. The same was the answer of the rest, with some alteration of
words, for they were questioned one by one, every one by himself.
<hi>Hollingerius</hi> answered, that he could not <hi>eam recipere legem, eamque
ingredi viam,</hi> which tended openly to the ruin and oppression of the
better cause. For by so doing he should greivously wound his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
before God, and cast <hi>irreparabile scandalum</hi> before the true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers
of God. <hi>Imitabor itaque exemplum Christi: Silebo, et omnem
eventum commendabo illi qui venturus est adjudicandum vivos &amp; mortuos.
Neranus</hi> spake after the same manner, and added, that the Reasons why
they thus thought themselves bound to answer, they had exhibited
this Morning to the Secular Delegates. <hi>Poppius</hi> gave answer thus,
<hi>Respondeo, cum debita erga summas Potestates reverentia, me invocato sanctis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>simo
Dei nomine, &amp; retota etiam atque etiam expensa apud animum meum,
non posse des<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:114807:153"/>
Optimo maximo &amp; Christo Jesu probatum iri. Martinus Gregiiro</hi> advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
him here to bethink himself a little whether or no he spake not these
words in Passion (for he seem'd to be somewhat Cholerick.) He replied,
that he spake them with his best advice. The <hi>Praeses</hi> perceiving that they
were resolved not to Answer, concluding the questions which he had
proposed, thought that the Synod might without scruple accept of the
first Article in their Remonstrance at the <hi>Hague,</hi> for their proper te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent.
He proceeded therefore to propose unto them another Interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory:
Whether or no, that Decree which they spake of in that first
Article, did contein the whole Decree of Election, and so were the
main ground of Christianity; or whether there were not some Decree
besides this. The behavio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>r and answers of the Remonstrants carryed
the same Copie of Countenance with the former, and <hi>Poppius</hi> plainly
answered, <hi>Quia conscientiae meae à Synodo non habetur ratio, non expecto
ab ea instructionem in veritate: ideóque consul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>um non est respondere.</hi> The
<hi>Praeses</hi> then citing some Texts out of <hi>Johannes Arnoldi,</hi> and <hi>Arminius,</hi>
and the <hi>Hague</hi> Conference, concluded that it was their opinion, that
besides that Decree mention'd in the Conference, they acknowledged
no farther Decree of Election. In the third place this question was put
the Remonstrants: whether when they taught, that God chose Man
<hi>propter fidem praevisam,</hi> this were not rather to be called an Election of
(<hi>Faith</hi>) then of the person; since the person was chosen for the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
sake. But they were still the same. <hi>Neranus</hi> was the man that
gave it, but it was the common answer of them all: <hi>Si liceat nobis de
Reprobatione, &amp; Contra-Remonstrantium sententia super ea agere quantum
nobis conscientia nostra &amp; Eclesiarum nostrarum aedificatio persuadebit su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                           <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficere,
&amp; boc nobis in antecessum promittatur, libentur ad quaesita responde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimus:
si minus, silere malumus.</hi> Now because they had often appeal'd
to their Reasons exhibited in <hi>Scripto</hi> to the Secular Delegates that
Morning, the Delegates thought good to read the writing in the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Synod. It contein'd almost no new thing, but was a repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of their old exceptions, that their Liberty was prejudiced, that
the Synod was <hi>pars adversa</hi> (and for farther illustration of this, they
reckoned up all the sharp speeches that either <hi>Scultetus</hi> or the Divines
of <hi>Geneva,</hi> or any other had used against them) that their Consciences
would not allow of this manner of proceeding, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>This last Night was there a private meeting, not by way of Session,
but only it was a Conference to which some of the Graver &amp; Discreet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the Synod were call'd. The end was only to advise what course
is best to be holden in the following disputations. It was thought fit
that the Remonstrants should alwayes be present at their meetings, and
questions should be proposed them: but the Synod should proc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:114807:154"/>
they answer'd or no: and so they concluded of a course to gather
their opinions out of their Books. Mr. <hi>Amyes</hi> will inform your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
more largely peradventure in some farther circumstances, his sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

                     <p>UPon Wednesday the ninth of <hi>January, stylo novo,</hi> the Synod met not
at all. Time was given the Deputies to advise of the <hi>Theses</hi> which
were to be handled: only at Night the English went in private to the
<hi>Praeses</hi> to consult what manner of proceeding were fittest to be used.
What counsel they gave him I know not: but this I see, that the course
he taketh is not altogether so well approved by them. Upon Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
the tenth of <hi>January</hi> the Commissioners met in the Morning in
private, where Mr. <hi>Praeses</hi> proposed unto them four things to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of. First, whether or no the <hi>Theses</hi> proposed by him formerly did
not perfectly contein the opinion of the Remonstrants. Secondly,
<hi>An electio sit una an multiplex,</hi> that so he might exclude the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants
Division of Election in <hi>Revocabilem &amp; irrevocabilem; completam
&amp; incompletam, &amp;c.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>An electio sit ex fide &amp; obedientia, an potius
ad fidem &amp; obedientiam.</hi> For this is one main point of difference: the
<hi>Remonstrant</hi> teaches, <hi>that God foresaw only who would believe, and so ordein'd
and Elected only to Glory:</hi> the <hi>Contra-Remonstrant</hi> teacheth, <hi>that God ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dein'd
who should believe, and so predestinated and Elected both to Grace
and Glory.</hi> The fourth thing proposed was concerning the means how
true believers become sure of their Salvation. After this the Synod was
requested to deliver themselves concerning a Method of proposing and
examining the <hi>Theses</hi> proposed. The greatest part of them liked well
of that form which the <hi>Praeses</hi> proposed. The <hi>English,</hi> the <hi>South-Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
and <hi>Festus Hommius</hi> conceived severally a form of <hi>Theses,</hi> every
man according to his discretion, and exhibited them to the Judgement
of the Synod, and had them publikely read: this was the sum of that
meeting. A Copie of the <hi>Theses</hi> drawn by our <hi>Englishmen</hi> I will send
your Honor, as soon as I can procure the sight of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="58" facs="tcp:114807:154"/>The same day at Evening the Deputies met in private as before. They
continued yet their consultation upon the point of manner of proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
The <hi>Praeses</hi> invented certain new Interrogatories and propounded
them to the Synod, to know their mindes whether it were not fit to
propose them to the Remonstrants. There was great doubt whither
this were a thing fit to be done, since it is not likely that the Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants
behaviour in this behalf will be any other then hitherto it
had been. This question, as it seems, was the greatest part of their
consultation. It was at length Concluded that the Remonstrants should
be call'd in, and the Interrogatories put to them, the next Session.
This Morning therefore we look for an open Session, where we shall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the last nights Interrogatories, and the whole business of that
Session. For I must Confess, I do not well conceive what was then
done, or to what purpose. I perceive there is some variance about their
form of proceeding: Mr. <hi>Praeses</hi> is desirous that the course he hath
thought of may take place; the <hi>English</hi> and others, that some more
ready and compendious way may be taken. What will be the Issue of
it, I cannot yet conjecture as soon as I can understand any thing, I will
acquaint your Honor, till when I humbly take my leave.</p>

The confusion here in handling of business is very great; they
do not know how to put any thing to Committees to agree of business,
and then afterward to propound it to the Synod to be approved or dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved;
which hath been the custom observed in all Councils and
Synods: but nothing is known till it be propounded in the Synod, and
then there are almost as many several voices as heads; if your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
would give your advice to some of the Estates in this kinde, it may
be they would apprehend it, and we should bring business to some issue.
The <hi>Palatine</hi> Divines and we have met now three times, and we have
agreed on the same Propositions, and have resolved to call one of every
Colledge of the Forreign Divines, and communicate the same with
them; that so, if it be possible, all we strangers may set up, and throw
down the same Conclusions. For the Provincials, for any thing I can
see, they are so far set against the Remonstrants, I wish not their persons
as well as their opinions, that I am afraid they will not like well of our
moderation. For the <hi>Dismission</hi> of the Remonstrants, since your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
is pleased to take notice of it, I hope I may without offence say
that it was such, as certainly did the Synod much wrong On Friday
when they seemed to yield, then the <hi>Exteri Theologi</hi> could not be heard
for the continuing of them in the Synod. Nay the trick which was put
upon them was a little too palpable; <hi>For the Delegates had their Decree
of Dismission written before they came into the Synod,</hi> yet our voices were
asked, hoping it should have been answerable to their Decree: but
finding it was otherwise, without so much as laying their heads toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for consultation, <hi>they published a Decree which they brought written
with them into the Synod.</hi> On Munday the late Acts of the Remonstrants
incredible obstinacy being read; the <hi>Theologi exteri</hi> gave suffrages for
their dismission; onely one to wit <hi>Steinius</hi> gave a bitter sentence; their
voices being asked only, who are not above a <hi>third part of the Synod,</hi>
                        <pb n="61" facs="tcp:114807:155"/>
they were call'd in and dismist with such a powdering spe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>ch as I doubt
not but your Lordship hath heard with grief enough, I protest I am much
afflicted when I think of it. For if the Remonstrants should write, that
the President pronounced a sentence, which was not the sentence of the
Synod, they should not lie. The Civil Lawyers and Cannon of <hi>France,</hi>
who write much about the formalities omitted in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi>
urge Exceptions of lesse moment then these; so neither was there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
a <hi>third part of the voices asked, ex quibus sententia ferri <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>quit:</hi>
neither was the sentence conceived in writt, and approved by the Synod,
and the bitter words in the Sentence were not the words of any of the
suffrages, unless that some of them were spoken by one man only.
Your Lordships Censure of that Sentence is just and honourable.
Mr. Dean of <hi>Worcester</hi> at his going from hence, with the Remembrance
of his service to your Lordship, desired me to signifie to your Lordship,
that he could not possibly meet with <hi>Deodatus.</hi> The Remonstrants, (as
<hi>Heinsius</hi> but now told me) have sent a very virulent and bitter writing
to Mr. <hi>Bogarmanne,</hi> it may be now we shall hear of it at the Synod, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we are going: so with the remembrance of my humblest Ducie
and service to your Lordship and your worthy Lady, I must conclude a

                     <p>IT hath pleased the Synod at length finally to discharge themselves of
the Remonstrants, and to proceed according as they had projected
by gathering their opinions out of their Books. The manner of their
dissmission was this. Upon Munday the 4/14 of <hi>January</hi> the Commissioners
being set, the <hi>Praeses Polyticus</hi> made a short speech to this purpose. That
they had hitherto labou'rd as much as in them lay to have the Decree of
the Estates to be kept, and to bring the Remonstrants to some reasonable
resolution. And for this purpose had upon Saturday last in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon,
covented them and advised them to give up their opinions, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly,
orderly, freely, and to refute the contrary as much as they thought
fit, reserving alwayes to the Synod Authority to judge of what was
convenien<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>, what was sufficient, without which it could be no Synod.
That they had undertaken in their behalf, that the Synod should so
manage the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>siness, that they should have no just cause to complain.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:114807:156"/>
But all this labor was lost, neither would they be brought to relinquish
their former plea; for in a writing exhibited unto them they signified
so much in effect, in which writing they refer'd themselves to such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
as had been by them partly <hi>scripto,</hi> partly <hi>viva voce</hi> formerly
required. Wherefore they thought fit that it should be proposed to
the Synod to judge whether or no there had not been sufficient order
taken to give contentment to the Remonstrants, if at least any thing
could content them. Yet they thought it convenient once more to
call the Remonstrants before them, to see whether they would leave
their holdfast and submit to the Synod. If no, then they should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any farther delay proceed to judge of their opinions by collecting
them out of their Writings, This was the sum of that speech. The
wrighting mentioned by the <hi>Praeses Politicus</hi> in his speech was then read
first in <hi>Dut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>h,</hi> then in <hi>Latine,</hi> in which the Remonstrants declared that
they would submit themselves unto the Synod upon such conditions as
had formerly been required, otherwise no. After this was the Synod
requested to deliver their opinions, whether order sufficient to content
the Remonstrants had not been taken. It was judged generally that
more could not be granted them then had already been, which was
they thought abundantly sufficient. <hi>Scultetus</hi> did in brief give as it were
a history or rather an inventory of the Remonstrants behaviour since
their first appearance before the Synod, and shewed how contumeliously
they had handled it, how they had contemned the Decrees of the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
and of the Synod, that they had abused them with lyes, deceitfull
speeches, &amp;c. And concluded that it was unfit the Synod should farther
condescend unto them. When the Forreigners had spoken, it was
thought sufficient, nei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>her did the <hi>Praeses</hi> proceed to ask the judgment of
the Provincialls, knowing belike before what it was The Remonstrants
then being called in the <hi>Praeses</hi> signified to them that upon Friday
Morning they had given good hope of peacable dealing, and at
least in shew seemed to forgoe such conditions as they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
claimed, he was now in the name of the Synod to requre
them to answer Categorically, yea or no, <hi>an veluit simpliciter &amp; sine
conditione parere Decreto Ordinum &amp; Synodi &amp; ita simplicitur venire in
rem praesentem.</hi> The Remonstrants for answer require that they may
be permitted to read a short writing which they had conceived. It was
answered that it needed not, there was no more required, but their
yea or no, but they persisted in their proposall, the Writing was taken
and delivered to the Seculars to be perused, and they commanded to
withdraw. There writing was read, wherein having signified; how
welcome the moderation held by the Forreigners lately was unto them;
whereas they were injoyned to obey the Synodicall Decree, or look
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:114807:156"/>
for punishment, their answer was that it could not stand with their
Conscience to promise Obedience to all Synodicall Decrees, since ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of them stood not with Common AEquity, and as for Mulct and Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment,
they left it to the Discretion of those to whose Government
they were subject; they would provide their patience. That they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
not to contest with the Synod concerning order: that they promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to submit: but with such conditions as they had heretofore menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd.
Thus as the <hi>Praeses</hi> said what they gave with the one hand, with
the other they took away again. The Remonstrants being again called
in, they were asked every man whether they acknowledged this answer,
they all replyed, they did, and so were commanded to subscribe their
Names to it, which forthwith was done. The <hi>Praeses</hi> then Bespake
them on this manner. <q>The moderation of the Foreigners which you
so much extolled, proceeded out of their Errour which to day having
understood, they have pronounced concerning you another sentence.</q>

                        <q>Upon Friday last when you seemed to disclaim all illimitted Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and gave hope of some Conformity, they dealt with the Synod

take the Synod for the Adverse part, and account your selves in
Equall place with them, this conceit hath manifested it self in all
your actions. <hi>Theses</hi> upon the question in controversy you gave up, but

that ever you protested your selves provided to give answer on the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:114807:157"/>
Articles, or to have had any such writing ready, which all the
Synod knows to be false. Your actions all have been full of fraud ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocations
and deceit. That therefore the Synod may at length
piously and peacably proceed to the perfecting of that business for
which it is come together, you are dismist. But assure you the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
shall make known your pertinacy, to all the Christian World,
and know that the <hi>Belgick Churches</hi> want not <hi>arma Spiritualia,</hi> with

and so the Synod brake up.</p>
                     <p>The same day at night there was a privat Session; what was done in

                     <p>SInce the Dismission of the Remonstrants there hath not been any
publick Session, and as I Conjecture for a while will not be. They
are altogether in Consultation concerning their order of proceeding,
and in gathering materialls out of the Remonstrants Books, whence
they may Frame their <hi>Theses</hi> and propositions which must be the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of their disputation. This they purpose, as I conceive, to do
through out all the Five Articles, before they come to the open discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of any one, for they are past from the first, and gone one to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.
So that till this Consultation be ended there will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
great occasion of news.</p>
                     <p>Against Mr. <hi>Praeses</hi> so rough handling the Remonstrants at their Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
there are some exceptions taken by the Deputies themselves.
The Forreigners think themselves a little indirectly dealt withall, in
that it being proposed to the whole Synod to pass their judgement
concerning the behaviour of the Remonstrants, the <hi>Provincials were not
not at all required to speak,</hi> and by these meanes the envy of the whole
business was derived upon the Forreigners. Whereas on the contrary
when the like question was proposed formerly, and the Forreigners had
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:114807:157"/>
spoken very favourable in ihe Remonstrants behalf, the Provincials
stroke in, and establisht a rigid sentence, against the Forreigners liking,
<hi>So that there is little regard given to the judgement of the Forreigners, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they speak as the Provincials would have them.</hi> Again upon the Tues<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
Session in the morning, there being a repetition made, according to
the custom, of the late Synodical acts, when they came to the act of
the Remonstrants Dismission, <hi>Lud. Crosius</hi> of <hi>Breme</hi> signified that he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that Mr <hi>Praeses</hi> in that business had been <hi>paulo commotior,</hi> and had
let slip, <hi>verba quaedam acerba,</hi> which might well have been spared; that in
so great an act, as that was, a little more advice and consideration might
have been used. The Synod ought to have been consulted with, and
a form of Dismission conceived and approved of by all, which should in
the name of the Synod have bin pronounced, and registred; whereas now
the Synod stands indicted of all that unnecessary roughness which then
was practised. It had stood better whith the Honor of the Synod to
have held a more peaceable and passionless order. The <hi>Preses</hi> replied,
that for Dismissing the Remonstrants without a Synodical form, it was
from the Secular Lords, who willed him immediately to proceed, What
his apologie was for his passionate speeches I know not. The Session was
in private, and I have nothing but by relation. I hear nothing yet
from Mr. <hi>Preses</hi> concerning the <hi>French</hi> project: as soon as I shall hear
ought, I will not fail to acquaint your Honor till when I humbly take my leave.</p>

                     <p>YOur Honour shall here receive the Decree of the Synod mentioned
in my last Letters, conteining the form of proceeding which they
will hold in discussing the Articles. The morning they mean the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
shall spend in private, after dinner in open Synod the chief places of
Scripture upon which the Remonstrant grounds himself shall be opened,
and answers fram'd to the Arguments drawn from thence. According to
which resolution they began to proceed upon Thursday the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>/17 of <hi>Janu.</hi>
in the Evening. The question proposed then was, <hi>An praeter Decretum de
salvandis fidelibus, nullum sit aliud Decretum Electionis.</hi> The Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strant
affirms there is none, and for this produces certain places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture.
The Contra-Remonstrant grants that there is such a Decree,
but withall contends that this is but a Secondary Decree. For <hi>God</hi>
                        <pb n="66" facs="tcp:114807:158"/>
(saith he) <hi>first resolved upon the Salvation of some certain singular persons,
and in the second place decreed to give them Faith as a means to bring the
former Decree to pass.</hi> But before this question came on the stage, other
things were done at that time. The Synod therefore being met, at the
time mentioned, First the Letters from the States concerning <hi>D. Goads</hi>
Admission were read, and after that, some were sent to his Lodging to
conduct him to the Synod. In the mean time were there Letters from
Mr. Dean to the Synod produced and read, together with a form of
Valediction and farewell, by him conceived. I suppose Mr. Dean ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
your Honor with the thing whilst hee was with you, which is
the cause I have not sent a transcript of it: as soon as I understand your
Lordship hath not seen it, I will cause a Copy of it to be taken. It was
then concluded by the Synod that the <hi>Praeses,</hi> and Assessors, together
with the Seculars Scribe, should, after the Synod was ended, repair to
Mr. Dean, and take their leave of him in the name of all the rest, and
by him commend their love and service unto his Majestie, and render
him humble thanks for his princely care, All which the same night
was done. Now was <hi>Dr. Goade</hi> come to the Synod, and according to
the manner, conducted to his seat, where being sate, he made a short
speech, which being ended, the Synod proceeded to dicusse the question
above metion'd. The Decree is, that the Professors shall expound those
places of Scripture, on which the Remonstrant builds. Wherefore <hi>Jo.
Polyander</hi> who is the Senior Professor, being absent, <hi>Sibrandus Lubber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>
who is the next in order, tooke the question, and answer'd such Texts
as were urged by the Adversary, one out of the 3. of John, 36. <hi>Qui cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit
in filium habet vitam aeternam: qui non credit non videbit vitam, sed
ira Dei manet super eo.</hi> Another out of the 1. to the Ephes. 4. <hi>Elegit
nos in Christo ante jacta mundi fundamenta:</hi> A third out of 11. to the
Hebrews <hi>Impossibile est sine fide placere Deo.</hi> The summe of <hi>Sibrandus</hi>
his answer at that, time I can not give. For being misinform'd that it
would be but a private Session, I was not at it. Besides <hi>Sibrandus</hi> no man
spake any thing that night. As soon as he had done, it was signified
by the <hi>Praeses</hi> that the <hi>Campenses,</hi> who were lately cited, were now
ready to make their appearance. It was concluded, that because the
business of the Synod should not be interrupted, certain out of the
company should be appointed to hear the cause and make relation of it
to the Synod: so the <hi>Praeses</hi> concluded the Session with a prayer, in
which he prayed for Mr. <hi>Deans</hi> Health, and for the good success of his
journey. This was the summe of what was then done, and so I end, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
your Honor to Gods good protection,</p>

                     <p>UPon wednesday the 6/16 of <hi>January</hi> there was no Session at all in the
morning, in the evening there was one, but in private. In this
they have concluded the question about their manner of proceeding.
There was a forme conceived and concluded upon, and transcribed by
all the Deputies. They concluded likewise their <hi>Theses</hi> upon the first
Article, which they purpose publickly to discusse. It was late in the
evening ere this Session was done, so that I could not get the Copies
of either of these, but in my morrow. Letters I will not fail by Gods
grace to send your Honor the transcripts of them. Besides, there were
some things of smaller weight advised of. First, whether in delivering
of their judgements upon the Articles in Controversie, the Forreigners
should begin, as hitherto they had done. The Provincials at first
strain'd courtesie, and thought it no point of good manners, to take
Precedency of the Forreigners: but it is concluded, they must, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
better tried in these Controversies then the Forreigners are, and
therefore meete it was they should give them more time to advise. The
second thing proposed was concerning their Auditory. For they questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd
whether they should admit of hearers, or do all in private. Old
<hi>Sibrandus</hi> was very hot against the Auditory, and thought it not fit that
any care should be had of them, as being only <hi>Mulierculae, &amp; pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

juvenes incauti.</hi>
There is some reason of this complaint of his, for
many youthes, yea and Artificers, and I know not what rabble besides
thrust in, and trouble the place. As for women whole troopes of them
have been seen there, and the best places for spectators reserved for
them. Which thing must needes expose the Synod to the scorne of
those, who ly in wait to take exception against it. But the Synod hath
determined in favour of their Auditory, that Sessions consultatory and
Provisionall shall be private, but Sessions wherein they discusse and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
shall be publick. Meetings heerafter will not be so frequent, for
men will take more time to advise. This is the summ, as farr as I can
learn, of what was done at that time. To morrow your Lordship
shall receive farther information, till which time I humbly take my
leave.</p>

                     <p>UPon Friday the 8/18 of January in the Evening, the Synod being met,
Doctor <hi>Gomarus</hi> answered some parts of Scipture, laid hold of by
the Remonstrants, after the same manner as <hi>D. Sibrandus</hi> had done the
night before, the places by him discust were for the more part the same
which in the former Session had been handled. The order of discussing
these arguments is by continued discouse after the manner of La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>in
Sermons, or rather of Divinity Lectures, such as are read in our Schools.
In one thing the Discretion of both these Doctors was much approved.
For both of them holding that extream and rigid tenent, which <hi>Beza</hi>
and <hi>Perkins</hi> first of all acquainted the World with, yet notwithstanding
they held an unpartiall and even course, and never stroke upon it.
When <hi>Gomarus</hi> had spoken towards an hour and half, my Lord Bishop
deliver'd himself concerning the meaning of the same places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and after him certain other of the forraign Divines. After this
same Copy will all the news be yet this ten days or more, &amp; these even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sessions are only to entertain the Auditory, not to determine any
thing at all. Each company must in private conceive and set down in
writing their opinion concerning the Articles; and when they have so
done the Writings must be exhibited to the Synod, and out of them
must be gathered the Conclusion which must stand for good. This is a
thing which will require some good time, and in the mean while be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
these Theologicall Lectures, there shall be nothing done publickly
in the Synod. The same day at night <hi>Bisterfieldius,</hi> one of the Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
lately come out of <hi>Nassau</hi> died. When his Funerall will be I know
not. Upon Friday Morning Mr. <hi>Dean</hi> took his journey toward <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourgh.</hi>
Upon Saturday their was no Session at all Mr. <hi>Balcangual</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends
his Service unto your Honor, and required me to signify to you
thus much, that he had lately spoken with <hi>Musius,</hi> but understood no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
by him concerning the matter which your Lordship is privy too.
He willed me moreover to inform your Honor, That whereas you late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
spake to Mr. <hi>Dean</hi> to deal with <hi>Deodati,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dean</hi> by reason of his
indisposition of Body, and sudden departure; found no means to talk
with him. Thus with humble recommendation of my Service to your
Honor, I take my leave.</p>

                        <q>THe Errours of publike actions (if they be not very gross) are
with less inconvenience tollerated then amended. For the
danger of alteration, of disgracing and disabling Authority, makes
that the Fortune of such proceedings admits no regress, but being once
howsoever well or ill done, they must for ever after be upheld. The
most partialls spectator of our Synodal acts can not but confess, that in
the late dismission of the Remonstrants, with so much choler and heat,
there was a great oversight committed, and that whether we respect
our common profession of Christianity, <hi>Quae nil nisi justum s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>
                              </gap>adet &amp; lene;</hi>
or the quality of this people apt to mutine by Reason of long Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and not having learnt to be imperiously commanded, in which
argument the Clergy above all men ought not to have read their first
Lesson. The Synod therefore to whom it is not now <hi>in integro</hi> to
look back, and Rectify what is amiss without disparagement, must now
go forward and leave events to God, and for the Countenance of their
action do the best they may.</q> For this purpose have they lately by
Deputies appointed for that end, made a Declaration of all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
unto the States Generall, from whom they have procured a
Decree for Confirmation of them, which Decree upon Munday the
11/21 of <hi>Jannary</hi> was publickly, first in Dutch then in Latin, read at the
Synod in the Evening. The particulars of it I shall not need relate as
being sufficiently known to your Honor. The Decree being pronounced,
<hi>Heinsius</hi> first signified that it had been before in private made known to
the Remonstrants, and then in the name of the Delegates warn'd the
Commissioners of the Synod, <hi>Ut quam mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

controversiis statuant, ut possint tandem afflictis eclesiis Belgicis subvenire.</hi>
I was very glad to hear that admonition, and it gives me hope that
our Synod shall have end not long after Easter at the Farthest. After
this did <hi>Tysius,</hi> another of the Professors discusse three other of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrants
arguments taken out of the <hi>Hague</hi> Conference, according
to the same forme as <hi>Sibrandus</hi> and <hi>Gomarus</hi> had done before. This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
done the <hi>Praeses</hi> required <hi>Jo. Polyander</hi> and <hi>Wallaeus</hi> to provide to do
the like upon Thursday next in the Evening (for before that time
there is to be no publick Session) and requesting the Company the next
Day to accompany <hi>Bisterfieldius</hi> to his Grave (which accordingly was
done at the time appointed) he dismist the meeting. So that till Thurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
next we are likely to understand no more news of the Synod.</p>
                     <p>I spake upon Tuesday with Mr. <hi>Praeses</hi> concerning <hi>Moulius</hi> project.

                        </gap>wer to me was this, that he communicated the thing with some
of the discreeter of the Synod, and that he had required my Lord Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
and <hi>Scultetus</hi> to conceive a forme of publick Confession. Which
as soon as it should be concieved and allowed of by those, who should in
that behalf be consulted withall, he would send a Copy of it to your
Honor, to be sent to his Majesty, by him to be revised and altered ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his pleasure, and so from him to be commended unto the
Synod publickly. Which course he thinks will take good success. As
touching the point concerning the <hi>Lutherans</hi> he thinks it not fit that
any word at all be made. I dealt with Mr. <hi>Praeses</hi> concerning a Copy of
M. <hi>Deans</hi> Valediction to the Synod; he answered me that he had delivered
it to <hi>Dammannus</hi> the Scribe to be copied out, and as soon as it was done, I
should have it to transcribe, so soon therefore as I can procure the
Copie of it, I will not fail to send it your Lordship. Mr. <hi>Dean</hi> at his
departure had an <hi>Honorarium</hi> bestowed on him by the States. <hi>Heinsius</hi>
the Scribe came to his lodging to him, and making a short speech un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
him, presented him in the Name of the States with <hi>munusculum</hi> as he
call'd it. What or how much it was no man knowes. Thus commending
your Honor to Gods good protection, I humbly take my leave.</p>

                     <p>UPon Tuesday she 12/22 of this present in the Evening, for, for the
debating of certain particular points in controversy belonging to
the first Article, the Synod came together in private. It hath been lately
questioned, how Christ is said to be <hi>Fundamentum Electionis.</hi> The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
generally received by the Contra-Remonstrant in this point is,
That God first of all resolved upon the Salvation of some singular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
and in the second place upon Christ as a mean to bring this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree
to pass. So that with them God the Father alone is the Author of
our Election, and Christ only the Executioner. Others on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
teach, that Christ is so to be held <hi>Fundamentum Electionis,</hi> as that he is
not only the Executioner of Election, but the Author and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer
of it: for proof of which they bring the words of the Apostle
to the <hi>Ephesians,</hi> the first Chapter, <hi>elegit nos in Christo ante jacta mundi
fundamenta.</hi> The Exposition of this Text was the especial thing discust
at this meeting,: and some taught, that Christ was <hi>Fundamentum Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionis,</hi>
                        <pb n="72" facs="tcp:114807:161"/>
because he was <hi>primus Electorum,</hi> or because he is <hi>Fundamentum
Electorum,</hi> but not <hi>Electionis,</hi> or because he is <hi>Fundamentum beneficiorum,</hi>
which descend upon us; others brookt none of those Restraints. D. <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marus</hi>
stands for the former sentence, and in defence of it had said many
things on Friday. This night <hi>Martinius</hi> of <hi>Breme</hi> being required to
speak his minde, signified to the Synod, that he made some scruple con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Doctrine passant about the manner of Christs being <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentum
Electionis,</hi> and that he thought Christ not only the Effector
of our Election, but also the Author and Procurer thereof. <hi>Goma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
who owes the Synod a shrewd turn, and then I fear me began to
come out of debt; presently, assoon as <hi>Martinius</hi> had spoken, starts
up, and tells the Synod, <hi>ego hanc rem in me recipio,</hi> and therewithall
casts his Glove, and challenges <hi>Martinius</hi> with this Proverb, <hi>Ecce Rho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,
e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>ce saltum,</hi> and requires the Synod to grant them a Duel, adding
that he knew <hi>Martinius</hi> could say nothing in refutation of that Doctrine.
<hi>Martinius</hi> who goes in a quipace with <hi>Gomarus</hi> in Learning, and a little
before him for his Discretion, easily digested this affront, and after
some few words of course, by the wisdom of the <hi>Praeses</hi> matters seemed
to be a little pacified, and so according to the custom, the Synod with
Prayer concluded. Zeal and Devotion had not so well allayed <hi>Goma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>
his choler, but immediately after Prayers he renewed his Challenge
and required Combat with <hi>Martinius</hi> again; but they parted for that
night without blowes. <hi>Martinius,</hi> as it seems, is somewhat favourable
to some Tenents of the Remonstrants concerning Reprobation, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
of Christs merit, the Salvation of Infants, &amp;c. and to bring him
to some conformity was there a private meeting of the Forreign Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
upon Wednesday morning in my Lord Bishops Lodging, in which
thus much was obtain'd, that though he would not leave his Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
yet he promised moderation and temper in such manner, that there
should be no dissention in the Synod by reason of any opinion of his.</p>
                     <p>Upon Thursday the 14/24 of this present, the Synod being met in the
Evening, <hi>Jo. Polyander</hi> and <hi>Wallaeus</hi> undertools the defence of some
places of Scripture brought by the Contra-Remonstrants against the
exceptions of the Remonstrants: the places of Scripture were, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.
20. <hi>Gaudete quia nomina vestra scripta sunt in Coelis. Apocal. 21. 27. inscripti
in libro vitae. Rom. 9. 11. Ut propositum Dei secundum Electionem maneret,</hi>
and 11. 5. <hi>Reservatio secundum Electionem:</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 13. <hi>Quos praede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinavit
ut conformes fiant imagini Filii sui, eos eriam vocavit. Act.</hi> 13. 48.
<hi>Crediderunt quot quot erant ordinati ad vitam aeternam.</hi> Upon these places
these two spake almost three hours.</p>
                     <p>It was expected that as the rest of the Professors hitherto have done,
so Doctour <hi>Davenant</hi> the next Professour should speak in publike: It is

                     <p>UPon Tuesday the 19/29 of <hi>January,</hi> at the Evening Session, the point of
Reprobation was Scholastically and learnedly discust by <hi>Altingius,</hi>
one of the <hi>Palatine</hi> Professors. His discourse was the most sufficient of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
that yet I heard. He began from the Definition, and proceded to how
far God had a hand in it, and how far man is the Author of his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction,
&amp; lastly answered the Remonstrants arguments. He spake about
an hour and half. I would willingly have given your Honour an account
of his speech, but it was in the Evening, and the Auditory are allowed
no candles, so that I could not use my tables. And thus have they discust
the first Article; though I could have wished that the question of Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
had been yet farther opened and stood upon, it being a point of
large extent, and especially insisted on by the Remonstrant. As for Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
Resolution in this first Article, that we must yet expect, till all the
rest be examined as this hath been. There is no open Session till Friday
next after dinner; and then is it their purpose to enter upon the Second
Article, of <hi>Universal Grace:</hi> at which time Mr. <hi>Balcanqual,</hi> and <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciger</hi>
of <hi>Hassia</hi> are appointed to speak, according as the rest have done
before, to this question, <hi>Whether the death of Christ were intended indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently
for all, or only for the Elect?</hi> Upon Wednesday the 20/30 of <hi>January,</hi>
in the evening was there a private Session, wherein, belike for the make<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of better speed, they consulted whether they should go on to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the rest of the Articles after the same manner they had done the
first, or else bethink them of some more speedy order. After a long
disceptation, even so long that <hi>Jo. Polyander</hi> put the <hi>Praeses</hi> in minde of
the exceeding sharpness of the Weather, they at length concluded, that
they would go on in the same course they had begun. And this as yet
is all the Newes that is passant, wherefore ceasing farther to trouble
your Honour, I humbly take my leave.</p>

                     <p>UPon Friday the 15/25 of January, there was a meeting of the Synod
partly publick, partly private. As the Provinciall Professors had
done, so was D. <hi>Davenant,</hi> who is the first Professor of the Forraigners,
enjoined by the <hi>Praeses</hi> to do. The intent of his discourse at that time,
was to overthrow certain distinctions framed by the Remonstrants for
the maintenance of their positions, and evasion from the Contraremon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strants
Arguments. The Remonstrants usually distinguish upon <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,</hi>
and divide it, into <hi>definitam &amp; indefinitam, revocabilem &amp;
irrevocabilem; peremptoriam &amp; non peremptoriam; mutabilem &amp; immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                           <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>abilem,</hi>
and the like. For the refutation of which distinctions he first
set down the definition of <hi>election</hi> brought by the Contraremonstrant,
and at large confirmed it: secondly he brought the definition of <hi>electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
agreed on by the Remonstrant, and Argued against it: and thirdly
he directly oppugned these forecited distinctions; all which he did
learnedly and fully. When Dr. <hi>Davenant</hi> had spoken: the Auditory
was commanded to <hi>depart.</hi> For having a purpose that others
should speake at the same time, and fearing that some <hi>diversity</hi> of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion
might rise, and occasion some dissention, it was thought fit that
things should be transacted as privately as might be. Many more of
the Forreigners deliver'd themselves that night, and amongst the rest
<hi>Martinius</hi> of <hi>Breme</hi> proposed again his former doubts unto the Synod,
concerning the <hi>sense in which Christ is,</hi> said to be <hi>fundamentum electionis,</hi>
&amp; requested to be resolved. But D. <hi>Gomarus</hi> at this time, was somewhat
better advised, &amp; thought it best to hold his peace. This day will there be
a private meeting wherein every company will give up their judgments
in writing upon the first Article: and to morrow I understand they will
go on unto the second, and proceed in it, accordingly as they have
done in the former. As for any <hi>Decisive Sentence</hi> they will give none,
till they have thus gone through all the five. In this I suppose they
do very discreetly. For since the Articles are mutually linked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
it is most convenient they should first go through them all, since
a predetermination in the former, might bind them to some inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
in the later, there being no place left to look back, but
stand they must to what they have once concluded. For avoiding of
this it is thought best to determine of all at once. And this is all the news
that here is currant: wherefore Commending Your Honour to Gods
good protection, I humbly take my leave.</p>

                     <p>UPon Munday the 18/28 of January in the Evening, the Synod being
met, <hi>Scultetus</hi> spake at large <hi>de Certitudine gratiae &amp; salvtis,</hi>
that it was necessary for every man to be assured of his Salvation. The
manner of his discourse was oratoriall, the same that he uses in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
not scholasticall and according to the fashion of disputation and
Schools. For this cause the question was neither deeply searcht into,
nor strongly proved. And this is all was done that night.</p>
                     <p>I spake with Mr. Dr. <hi>Goad</hi> concerning Mr. <hi>Brent,</hi> who answer'd me
that he heard nothing at all of him, and that he will shortly write unto
My Lord Archbishops Secretary to be informed farther concerning him.
My Lord Bishop of late hath taken some pains with <hi>Martinius</hi> of <hi>Brente,</hi>
to bring him from his opinion of <hi>Vniversall Grace.</hi> By chance I came to
see his Letter writen to <hi>Martinius</hi> in which he expounded that place in

                     <p>UPon Thursday the 24/31 of January in the Evening the Synod met
privately, and as they had done in the first, so did they in the
second Article. For the speedier Direction to finde the places in the
Remonstrants Books, where the particulars concerning Vniversall
Grace are discust, there was a kinde of <hi>Index</hi> or Concordance drawn
of the severall passages in their writings touching that subject. The

Remonstrants would have it. This hast chat is made in this suddain
passing from one Article to another is much mervail'd at by our English
Divines: for the Colledges yet have not all given up their opinion upon
the first, and besides that the Remonstrants upon Wednesday last were
willed to give in their Arguments upon the first Article. For notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
they be excluded from personall appearance in the Synod, yet
are they Commanded to Exhibit to the Synod whatsoever they shall
please to command. Now some time will be required for the Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
of those reasons, if they be of late invention, and such as yet have
had nothing said to them. But what the reason of this hast is, will
appear hereafter.</p>
                     <p>I lately writ unto Mr. <hi>Collwall</hi> to know what Order was to be taken
for the discharge of my lodging, whether your Honor were to answer

and then because I have sundry private occasions that call upon me to
return. For notwithstanding this hast, of which I but now spake, it will
be long ere the Synod will come to determine any thing, and about

the Deputies met privately in the Evening, where the first thing that
came upon the Stage was that old impertinent business concerning the
<hi>Campenses,</hi> at what time <hi>Scotlerus</hi> a Remonstrant Minister who had
been formerly cited to appear before the Synod, having not appeared
at time appointed, pretended sickness and for that cause he required
the Synods patient forbearance. After this they entred into consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
concerning certain Books and Writings to be conceiv'd partly for
declaracion of the Synods meaning in the Doctrine of the five Articles,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:114807:164"/>
partly in Apology for it. And first it was proposed that there should
be <hi>scriptum didacticum</hi> a plain and familiar writing drawn, wherein the
Doctrine of the five Articles according to the intent and meaning of the
Synod should be perspicuously exprest for the Capacity of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
sort, and that in Dutch and Latin. The Apologicall Writings
were of two sorts, first <hi>Scriptum Elenchicum</hi> wherein there were to be
refuted such Errours as had been lately broached in prejudice of the
received Doctrine: secondly <hi>scriptum Historicum,</hi> which was to consist of
two parts, first a narration of the Synods proceedings with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrant,
from the day of his first appearance till the time of his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection:
for the refutation of many bitter invectives which lately had
been written against the Synod in that behalf. Secondly a Relation <hi>de
causis turbarum,</hi> who were the Authors of the late Stirs in time of the
separation; for answer of <hi>Episcopius</hi> his Oration, and other Writings of
the Remonstrants, in which the whole misorder is turn'd upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra-Remonstrant.
For the <hi>Scriptum didacticum</hi> the <hi>English</hi> were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
against it: and so was <hi>Vosbergius.</hi> Their Reason was, because it
seem'd incongruous that any writing concerning the Doctrine of the
Articles should be set forth before the Synod had given Sentence. And
indeed I must confess I see no great congruity in the proposall, whilst
matters are in controversy: Judges walk suspensly, and are indifferent
for either party, and whatsoever their intent be, yet they make no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verture
of it till time of sentence come. All this business of <hi>citing, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring,
examining</hi> must needs seem only as acted on a stage, if the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod
intempestively before hand bewray a resolution. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
any reason alleadgable against it, the thing is concluded, and
<hi>Wallaeus, Udemannus,</hi> and <hi>Triglandius</hi> are deputed to write a discourse
to that purpose, with the inspection and supervision of my Lord Bishop,
<hi>Scultetus, Brittingerus,</hi> and <hi>Deodatus.</hi> For the <hi>scriptum historicum</hi> in the
first part concerning the proceeding of the Synod with the Remonstrant,
there is required the pains of <hi>Scultetus</hi> and <hi>Triglandius</hi> in the second
part <hi>de causis turbarum, Latius</hi> must bestow his labour, with the help of
<hi>Festus Hommius,</hi> of the <hi>South-Holanders</hi> and <hi>North-Hollanders,</hi> who best
of any know the whole carriage of that matter. To the composing of the
<hi>scriptum elenchicum</hi> there are deputed four of the Provincials Professors,
<hi>Jo. Polyander, Lubbertus, Gomarus</hi> and <hi>Thysius,</hi> to whom are adjoyned as
helpers and Supervisors D. <hi>Davenant, Altingius</hi> and <hi>Martinius.</hi> But the
business of this writing past not without some opposition, <hi>Deodat.</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
misliked it, <hi>Polyander</hi> requested that his pains might be spared:
<hi>Novi,</hi> saith he, <hi>quam sit mihi curta supellex.</hi> But above all D. <hi>Gomarus</hi>
was most offended at the Proposall. <hi>Bella mihi video, bella parantur ai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>.</hi>
And therefore quite refusing to consent to any Polemicall writing, he
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:114807:164"/>
advised that the <hi>scriptum didacticum</hi> should abstain, <hi>a non necessariis &amp;
privatis,</hi> and contein only necessary points such as pass by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent.
That they should expect till the Remonstrant had set forth some
adversary writing, and then would be a fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>er time to think of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
in this kind. I blame not D. <hi>Gomarus</hi> if he a little recoil. For
being of the <hi>Supralapsarii,</hi> as they terme them, of those who bring the
Decree of Gods Election from before the fall, and seeing the Synod
not willing to move that way, but to subside in a lower sphere, he is
to be pardon'd, if he deny his hand to that writing, which he supposes
cannot be so warily indicted, but he must be forced with his own pen
to let fall somewhat Prejudiciall to his own opinion. The <hi>Praeses</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
that it was not his drift to force the Synod against their mindes
to set out such a Book; but only to take hold of the present occasion
whilst the Forreign Divines were here, and have such a Book in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
for use hereafter, though it were not now set forth. He farther
advised that those who were to undertake this, should have an eye to
the inclination of the Synod, and beware as much as might be, that
they toucht not there where any man was sore. Whatsoever the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
is, the mentioning of these Books, before the Determination of
the Synod be formally set down, must needs be very unseasonable.
It <hi>will make the World to think they came resolved what to do, which though
perchance they did, yet it is no wisdome to confess it.</hi> After this did they
advise concerning the Exceptions against the Confession &amp; Catechisme,
and of such as should answer them. For the Catechisme, the <hi>Palatine</hi>
Divines undertook it: for the Confession some of the Provincialls were
appointed, whose names I have not learnt. The <hi>Praeses</hi> then by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Secular Delegates, advised the Synod to think of gathering
a Synopsis and brief of all the Synodicall Proceedings, to be sent to the
King of <hi>England,</hi> and other Foreigne <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> who had sent
Deputies to the Synod, that so they may understand what hath been
done. For this were there appointed <hi>Altingius Steinius,</hi> the Assessors
and Scribes; and for Supervisors were named <hi>D. Davenant, Praeses.</hi> This
is the summe of that Session.</p>
                     <p>On Tuesday at Even they met again in private, where every one
spake in order what they had further to say concerning the second Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.
Upon some occasion, I know not what, the <hi>Praeses</hi> mentioned <hi>Negotium
Vorstianum, Bertianum, &amp; Venatorianum,</hi> which I note because this is the first
time that <hi>Vorstius</hi> his cause was named in the Synod. There hath not
been any stay made amongst the Forraign Divines but only in this <hi>second</hi>
Article, out of which if they can wel &amp; clearly wrest themselves, their pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
out of the rest will be more smooth. I lately told your Honor that
<hi>Martinius</hi> of <hi>Breme</hi> made some doubts amongst the rest concerning <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:114807:165"/>
Grace.</hi> Not <hi>Martinius</hi> only but Dr. <hi>Ward in this point.</hi>

Evening, at what time <hi>Steinius</hi> of <hi>Hassia</hi> spake to the fourth Article
concerning the <hi>resistibility of Grace,</hi> in the same manner as others had
