            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

once reſolved with himſelf, to throw down head-long from the High Tower of
<hi>Cremona,</hi> the Emperor <hi>Sigiſmond,</hi> who was gone up thither, to ſee the City and
Country thereabouts. But at the very Juncture and Moment, his Conſcience was
affrighted: (<hi>Hiſtoria Italica.</hi>) All Hiſtorians ſay, He was a moſt excellent Prince:
He it was, that to cure the great Schiſm in the <hi>Papacy,</hi> procured the <hi>General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The Famous Emperour, <hi>Charles the Fifth,</hi> (born for Great Actions) eſcaped
juſt ſuch a Deſigne of being thrown from the Top of the Temple of <hi>Pantheon</hi> in
<hi>Rome,</hi> by a certain malevolent <hi>Italian;</hi> but his Heart failed him in the Nick of
Time. (<hi>Camerarius.</hi>)</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry the Third,</hi> Emperour, (a Famous Prince, and a Manager of great Wars)
was Entertained and Lodged very ſumptuouſly by the Counteſs <hi>Richilda;</hi> and as
ſhe was making a Requeſt to the Emperour, and he reaching his Hand to her, in
token of Appeal, the Chamber-Floor ſuddenly brake under them; the Emperour
fell into a Bathing-Veſſel, that was in the Room underneath, and had no Harm:

But <hi>Bruno,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Virtſbourgh, Alemannus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Everſbourgh,</hi> and the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs,</hi>

                  <hi>Frederick the Firſt,</hi> Emperour, being in St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Cloyſter in <hi>Erford,</hi> had Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to go the Privy, (ſome of Quality accompanying) ſuddenly the Floor ſunk,
and the Emperour had miſcarry'd, if he had not ſuddenly taken hold of the Grates
of a Window, where he hung till ſome came, and relieved him. Some Gentlemen
fell to the Bottom, and periſhed; among others, <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Swartzenbourgh,</hi>
who carryed the Preſage of his Death in a common Imprecation; which was this, <hi>If
I do it not, let me die in a Privy.</hi> [This was that Famous Emperour, ſtiled <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſſa,</hi>
(recommended to the States by his Predeceſſor <hi>Conrade</hi>) famous for his Wars
in <hi>Italy, Sicily,</hi> and <hi>Armenia;</hi> and who alſo 'ſcaped a great Danger, accompanied
only with one Servant; for a deſperate Fellow of a ſudden ruſhing upon him,
(out of an Ambuſcado) cloſe by a River, endeavoured to caſt him in: but not
prevailing, leapt himſelf into the River, and ſwam away. <hi>Albertus Crantzius.</hi>]</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry the Fourth,</hi> Emperour; This famous Prince was fain to put his Hand to the
Sword at Fourteen years of Age, and fought Sixty-two Battels, ere he laid down.
<hi>Aventine</hi> writes of him, he eſcaped a great Danger, near to <hi>Spire;</hi> for having
been by the Plotting of <hi>Hanno,</hi> (Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Collen</hi>) brought into a ſumptuous
Boat, trimmed and provided to carry him away Priſoner; miſdoubting that ſome
ill Turn was meant him, he caſt himſelf into the <hi>Rhine;</hi> where he had been drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but for the kind Endeavour of his Kinſman <hi>Egbert,</hi> who got him a Shoar.</p>
               <p>This ſame Emperour uſed to go often to Prayers in St. <hi>Maries</hi> Church, in Mount
<hi>Aventine. Pope Gregory</hi> the Seventh, (who carried a watchful Eye over this great
Princes Actions) commanded one to take notice of the Place where he was wont
to pray, and got a certain Fellow to go up upon the Top of the Church, and there
upon the Beams, to place certain great Stones, which ſhould be ſo fitly laid, that
with the leaſt touch they ſhould fall down upon the Emperour's Head, and brain
him at their Fall. The Villain went ſo haſtily to work, that as he thought to have
rowled down a very great Stone, the ſaid Stone (with his weight) drew him too:
So that Man and Stone came down together upon the Temple-floor; where the
Man was killed with the Stone that fell upon him, and the Emperour eſcaped.
The good Emperour notwithſtanding, would have the Wretch to be buried.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Bodin</hi> tells of a certain Gentleman of <hi>Normandy,</hi> who once reſolved to have
killed King <hi>Francis;</hi> but the Divine Power operating, he repented him of his
wicked Purpoſe. This was that Famous <hi>Francis,</hi> the great Emulator of <hi>Charles the
Fifth,</hi> and oppoſing him in all his Ambitious Undertakings.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Juſtin</hi> tells us, <hi>Aſtyages,</hi> upon a Dream, cauſed his Grand-Son to be delivered
to <hi>Harpagus,</hi> to be made away; which he unwilling to do himſelf, delivers him
to the King's Shepherd; he alſo unwilling to kill the Infant, expoſes him in the
Woods, and afterwards finds a Bitch ſuckling of him, and defending him from
Beaſts and Birds. His Wife perſwades him to expoſe her own Son, and bring up
the other; which is conſented to. Thus was that great Conquerour of <hi>Aſia (Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>)
preſerved, whoſe Birth was foretold by <hi>Iſaiah</hi> Three Hundred years before
it happened. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Juſtin</hi> telleth us alſo, <hi>Gargoris</hi> (King of the <hi>Curetes</hi>) his Daughter was got with
with Child; he commands the Innocent to be made away: Firſt, It was expoſed
in Solitary Places; and the Wild Beaſts they ſuckle it, inſtead of devouring it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
It is laid in a narrow Way, where droves of Beaſts went to, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

Mr. <hi>Guillim</hi> (but indeed Dr. <hi>Barkham,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> avers in his <hi>Worthies</hi>) ſays,
He is a Bird of great Beauty, and Strength alſo; and this is reported of him,
That he uſes not his ſtrength to prey or tyrannize over any other Fowl, but only

               <p>Certainly he was an Admirable Prince, by that wiſe and honeſt Advice he gave
his Son upon his Death-bed, (as <hi>R. Brook,</hi> p. 27) <hi>viz.</hi> To Miniſter the Laws in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently,

took the Name) giving them this Bird for an <hi>Hieroglyphick</hi> of the Love and Concord
he would have among 'em; <hi>Amoris &amp; unionis Symbolum,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I need make but little Comment upon what hath been ſaid. I have hinted before, the
generous Nature of the <hi>Swan,</hi> being like that of the <hi>Heroick Lyon;</hi> and he cannot but be
the <hi>Duke</hi>'s Bird. My Advice is:
