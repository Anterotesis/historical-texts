            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I am so much straitned, how to give my shallow and confused thoughts a vent, while I essay to contribute my poor mite, for alleying the bitternesse of your cup, and mitigating the greatnesse of your griefe (knowing well how little proportion what ever I am able to say keeps to the anguish of your soul, because of what you are put to suffer) as the sight of this indignation, wherewith you are filled, puts me to struggle with my inclination, and stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers me in my resolution to speake, as seeming rather to perswade me, because of the heavie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his hand upon you, to sit alone and keep silence, then to open my mouth, since the moving of my lips cannot asswage your griefe; yet affection (which easily procures a pardon, when it misseth the marke it aimed to hit) hath in the present clamant emergent emboldened me, out of my poverty and penury, to offer such as I have; and besides, I hope, both from the conviction of duety and knowledge, how much the depth of your distresse is beyond the supplies I can contribute for your ease, and the supportings of my feeble &amp; feek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse pen, to acconnt it m mercy, while you are in that <hi>Paroxisme</hi> &amp; agony of misery, through

                  </gap> soul into the hand of such an enemy, whose way thy soul hateth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have often heard, <hi>my deare and distressed friends,</hi> and you have professed also to be in the faith of this, <hi>That men may be more then conquerours, when killed all the day long,</hi> and that <hi>there is an hundred fold to be reaped in this life, even with persecution</hi>: Now set your selves, when killed and crushed, to put the crown upon your Profession; now adorne that Doctrine of God the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, which you Professe, by such a carriage, as will witnesse, you know, in the midst of what flesh can do unto you, how to be conforted in God, &amp; how to endure the worlds hatred and harme, as those whom no affliction can make miserable? O that he may put you in case to seale from your own experience the sweetnesse of suffering for Christ; And to say, now we know <hi>there is a river that refresheth the whole City of God,</hi> because he hath made us drink of this river of his pleasure, whereof since we drank, we have forgotten our Poverty, &amp; remember our Misery no more: now we can affirme from what we finde, (whereby our souls are forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied) that <hi>as the sufferings of Christ have abounded in us, so our consolation also hath abounded by Christ,</hi> for whom we have suffered the loss of these things, and in that loss are so great gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as now we know what we have lost is but dung; but what is left us, or rather what we have found in these begun fruitions of Jesus Christ, hath begun our heaven amidst all we suffer. Yea, I am hopeful, it shall be with you in your huntings, harassings, and hideings, as it was with <hi>Moses</hi> in the mount, never so neer God, as when at the remotest distance from all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-converse and comfort; And that even while you lye as among the pots, and are black with the smoak of that fiery furnace, heated seven times beyond what you or your Fathers have found, or could have feared, if Satan, whose element is fire, had not set the Instruments of your calamity on fire of hell, and transported them so far beyond the limits and latitude of all reason. As if the question were asked, <hi>Why doe these heathen rage?</hi> the answer behoved to be given, nay, aske them not a reason, for <hi>they are in rage against the Lord, and against his anointod</hi>: I say, while you are smothered with this smoak, &amp; made black, yet your face shall be made to shine, and you put in case to say, though we be black because this sun with its scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat hath looked upon us; yet are we comely, because the sun of righteousnesse with healing under his wings hath arisen upon our soul, and under the shadow of his wings we shine and sing, and are comforted.</p>
            <p>But to come more closely to what I intend in these lines. Let me tell you, <hi>deare Friends,</hi> that nothing can be more effectual for working up the heart to a right temper at all times, and more particularly in your present case, and for frameing a right the wayes of a Christian, when he must either go with the drove of those, who depart from the living God, or expose him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self for his adhesion to him, and relinguishing these workers of iniquity, yea opposing of their Christ-opposing courses, to all the effects of their fury, than well to know, and often to consider, what is the nature of that State and Condition, whereunto he is called as a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian; to know what is his relation to Jesus Christ, who hath chosen him; and to the world out of which he is chosen: this, if seriously and sutably pondered, would certainly cool his feverish heats, and quench his thirstings after the world, and would quicken his soul, and kindle in his heart much heat and warmth of love to Jesus Christ; it would stablish his heart, strenghten his hands, fortify against feare, and fournish him with what is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for the patient suffering of the worlds hatred and malice at him; How would a solid reflection of his being chosen out of the world, sweetly disengage him from the entangle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this world; and as one made partaker of the divine nature, make him so mind and so move, as his mindings and movings would make it manifest whatsoever is below God is below the designings, the desirings and endeavourings of his soul. And the true reason why there is so little of real Christianity to be found amongst Christians, is, we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider not that Christianity is the soul cast in that blessed mould of disconformity to the world,
<pb facs="tcp:42157:3"/>
and conformity to Christ, our having his blessed name called upon us; as it supposeth an association with him, so it obligeth to an assimilation to him, in order to the fruition of him, without which we can never make it appeare, that we are sharers of that unction, which is the import of that blessed name called upon us. There are few, Alas! amongst the many Professors of Religion, and pretenders to Christianity, who study to know the excellency of that state, the special comforts and the proper duties thereof, and the closenesse of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion which is amongst these. O! it must be an excellent state, which imports union with Jesus Christ. <hi>He that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit,</hi> saith the holy Ghost. And what must the privileges and the comforts be which follow upon and flow from this? For Religion, as it relates to these, is the very religation of the soul to God, as a portion, and that good part which cannot be taken from him; and then all the special duties thereof are but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of that begun conformity to Jesus Christ, till it be carried on, and consummat in a perfect likenesse to him. Now he, whose soul hath received just impressions of these things, is in case to carry amidst all surrounding miseries, as one who is happy without the world, and in despight of the world; for he hath a happinesse laid up in God, and to be laid out for him according to his need, which the world knoweth not of, and cannot take from him: hence it is, that <hi>he rejoyceth in hope, &amp; is patient in tribulation</hi>: And as for the duties of Religion he is not found of these as of an enemy, even when he is sure he cannot follow them, but his enemies will finde him and fall on him: he knowes no other question, but <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to doe</hi>? And when that is clear, sets himself to <hi>doe all things without disputings and murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>Therefore, <hi>deare Brethren,</hi> since you are not of the world, and since there is so great a change made in your state, and some blessed begun chance made betwixt you and the world in your manners, think it not strange concerning these fiery trials, which you meet with from the world, and must go thorow, till you get thorow the work: he hath not rightly received Christ Jesus, who looks not on suffering as his daily work: he who hath closed with Christ, and is resolved to keep him company to the end, that he may be with him without end, must be at a point in this that be where he will bonds and afflictions will abide him, in every place, yea he must resolve with it, and be in readiness for it, <hi>not only to be bound, but also to die for the name of the Lord Iesus</hi>; And that not amongst heathens, but in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where also <hi>his Lord was crucified</hi>; not only at <hi>Rome</hi> and amongst professed enemis, but in <hi>Scotland,</hi> but at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> where Christ Jesus our Lord is now crucified again, and put to open shame? not by a forraigne enemie, but by those who are <hi>Rulers</hi> (if it be not abuse of language to call them so, whose Government is pure Tyranny) and not only by <hi>Rulers,</hi> but by such Rulers as have bound their souls by the bond of a <hi>sacred and solemne Covenant,</hi> and stand eternally obliged, under the penalty of everlasting seclusion from the presence of God and from the glory of his power, to maintain that Reformation, the ruine whereof they drive with so much rigour and rage, and the razing of the foundations whereof they endeavour with the utmost of professed enmitie; to preserve that precious treasure for, and to propagat Religion in its purity to posterity; to protect these very persons, whom they persecute, and persecute for persist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in those wayes, wherein they themselves have give it under their hand to God they would walk. Now, we are not to think strange, concerning this fiery trial; for whosoever would be the

This fore-sight &amp; providence will be our wisdom; for when we have done so, we will not be amazed, when that comes to passe, we had resolved before hand to meet with; or put out of our postour, when these things do emerge, with which we had laid our reckoning.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>deare Friends,</hi> for fixing yourselves into a firmenesse of resolution to hold out and hold on, though it should come to a resisting unto blood, after you are robbed and spoiled of your goods; Consider that there is nothing in all these fires and waters, you have to passe tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; in all these dangers and deaths, which are before you; in all these trials, in all these hazards, nay in all these hells that are betwixt you and heaven, whch can prevail with a soul, that knowes in whom he hath beleeved, or perswade him to cast the blessed bargan, or go back from his Master, and walke no more with him. <hi>Whither shall we go from thee, for thou hast the words of eternal life?</hi> was the disciples deliberat and warme answer to that heart-moving question, <hi>will you also leave me?</hi> Leave thee Lord? Leave thee who will, we are for ever tied to an attendance upon thee, and continuance with thee, both by choice and by the chaine of our own advantage; that eternal life, which is in thee, and is to be had by abiding with thee, arrests us with a pleasant violence to wait upon thee, while we must foresake all in following <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And as it serves for dissolving that union between the Saints and the world,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42157:5"/>
so <hi>secondly</hi> it knits them the more closely to him, who hath chosen them out of the world; for when they finde themselves dealt with as strangers and pilgrims in the earth, exposed to all manner of hurt and hardship, they then are in earnest in seeking that satisfaction in God, which they misse in this howling wildernesse of sorrow; and as they never seek it so earnestly and ardently, as at such a time; so they never so readily finde it, that they may have a proof that their own portion is fat enough, and can still afford them royal dainties; and so sit down satis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ied with the enjoyment of God, even their own God, and sing amidst all wants and miseries, <hi>the lines are fallen to us in pleasant places.</hi> The reason then why the people of God are often in so much heavinesse, and frequently hunted &amp; harrassed with trouble &amp; tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is, that they may be hunted by the worlds hatred and evil handling of them, out of the world, home to heaven; that since they see what they have to expect here, they may gird up the loins of their mind, &amp; set their affections on things that are above, where Christ is &amp; there treasure: &amp; hence it is said, <hi>when the scourge slaieth suddenly, he laugheth at the trial of the innocent</hi>; which is not for want of affection, being a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

All men of reason have judged the mustering and marching of this host against you, a high trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of malice and madnesse; in the mean time you mourne, and the enemies laugh amongst themselves, and the Lord, notwithstanding he takes pleasure in the prosperity of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he rejoyceth also: But why is it so? It is so not only in regaird of your Adversaries, at whom he laughs, because he sees their day is coming, but because he hath such a compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in the soul prosperity of his people, that Court and Councel and all the Nation must be set a work to scoure the Saints, the vessels of honour, that they may shine in the beauty of holinesse, and sing in the begun fruitions of God: And thus by the effects of this fury, this malice and madnesse of persecuters, a company of his poor people, whom they intended to eat up as bread and to destroy, are made meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light; the place to which neither they who gave the orders, nor they who obeyed and put them in execution, shall ever be admitted, except they mourne and amend their manners too; for heaven is not a place for impure and polluted persons, there is nothing that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fileth or worketh abomination that can enter-in into that City, there is neither swine nor puddle there.</p>
            <p>But to come more particularly to the purpose, &amp; to show and set before you what grounds of strong consolation you may have, while handled as you are, by the persecuting enemy; Consider <hi>first,</hi> That it ought not onely to remove the strangenesse, &amp; to alley the bitternesse of your present sad lot; but also comfort you over it, and while under it, that your sweet <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Mast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

but in lowlinesse of mind, let each esteem other, better than themselves</hi>: Now what can be said after this? Here you have union nobly qualified, and arguments powerfully quickening to pursue after it; O fall a striving therefore, while put to strive against enemies, who shall love God and his precious interests most, and one another best: who shall be most ready to forbeare, and to beare one anothers burdens; that so, in fulfilling this law of Christ, all may the more cheerfully beare the Crosse of Christ: have there been amongst you animosities, conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, jealousies, whisperings, evil surmiseings, &amp;c.

Let therefore all unsuteable and unseasonable striving and unbrotherly and unchristian contending be prevented, or exstinguished, ere they come to a flame: for that is fatal. It is well known, how small a wedge of the same timber, driven by the policy of an enemy, especially when in power, hath made great and grievous breaches, amongst such, who once took sweet counsel together, and walked to the house of God in company: how frequently, in all ages of the Church, have they carrried away many, first to a connivance, then to a compliance (for he who is once cheated into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivanee, is easily charmed into a compliance) with their designes, and so rendered the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of the rest, who stood and withstood, lesse significant. Let us therefore be wise: Let us take notice of the Adversaries stratagems, whose maxime is <hi>Devide &amp; impera</hi>: And in this they are so cunning, and closs; as sometime they can personat a division amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, that they may the more certainly effectuat it, amongst us; which, when it comes to passe, it hath ever deplorable and dismal effects: For, there is ever a sad and certain connexion obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, betwixt a dividing time in the Church, and a further departure from the truth, and a hotter persecution of those, who cleave to God and his truth, with purpose of heart, But becaufe I know, the greatest pretenders to what is now pleaded for, and persuaded unto, are really the greatest enemies to that union and concord, intended by the Spirit of God; And, to the end they themselves may be applauded, in their not strivings, as becomes, for the truth; they, of all men, are most ready to represent such as doe, as fire brands and Church renders. And therefore, let none mistake what love to union, amongst all the serious servants of Jesus Christ, in such a day, hath caused me to drop; as if thereby, I did intend to plead for, or perswade unto, an union, with a disadvantage to the precious truth of God, and the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest
