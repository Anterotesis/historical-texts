            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MAny and great have been the Expectations of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple about the Event of the Commitment of the late Lord Chancellour to the <hi>Tower,</hi> and their Wiſhes have been as various, as they have been affected to him: Many (who had entertain'd a juſt Indignation againſt him for his late ill Conduct of Affairs) longed for his being brought to his Tryal, that he might receive that Juſtice that his Irregularities that he was committed for were thought to have deſerved. But Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence has diſappointed them herein, by calling him to a higher Bar, where he muſt give a juſt Account of all his Actions, and receive that juſt Reward that is due to him for the ſame, unleſs he has prevented it by his Repentance, and God's Infinite Mercy. As to the Manner of his Death, it was as followeth:</p>
            <p>He has been very much tormented with his old Diſtemper, the Stone and Rheumatiſm, almoſt ever ſince he has been in the <hi>Tower</hi>; and there has not been any help wanting, that Skill or Art could invent, for the continuation of his Life; but it has been all as ineffectual and vain, as the Supplications of the Diſtreſſed were ſometimes to him, in the time of his Power: For about this Month laſt paſt he has been in a very languiſhing condition, ſtill waſting away more and more, in which time he has hardly been in a capacity to take any thing to ſuſtain Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, unleſs a little Sack to revive it when it has been almoſt ſpent; about three Weeks ſince, he had a mind to a bit of <hi>Salmon,</hi> which he had, but could not digeſt it, nor ſcarce any thing elſe, unleſs a poach'd Egg: So he continued decaying till the Eighteenth of this Inſtant <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril</hi> 1689, when about half an hour after Three a Clock in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning he dyed, in the forty firſt Year of his Age; after having lived to ſee many ambitious Deſigns diſappointed, and their Moſt Gracious Majeſties King <hi>WILLIAM</hi> and Queen <hi>MART</hi> Seated on the Throne. <hi>Whom God long preſerve.</hi>
