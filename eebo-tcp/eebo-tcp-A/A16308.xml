            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="4">
               <hi>4.</hi> That in the deliuery of Elementarie matter I haue, for thy cause, rather vsed interlocution, then set, or continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous speech, as more apt to enter a Learner, for whose cause also at the end of the Booke are annexed sundry Tables.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5.</hi> That at the first reading to lay them downe, or away, either as too hard, or as now too stale, doth argue alike vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, the one of too much abiection, the other of too little stedfastnesse.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>6.</hi> That if thou wilt vse the pleasant obiects, and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall parts thereof to relish, and draw-on the rest the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thou holdest the right Rule of profiting thy selfe.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <hi>7.</hi> That all is properly meant, and written herein to them that are <hi>filij Artis,</hi> and willing to coöperate with the fauour of the Armoriall Muse.</p>
            <p>How thou (my <hi>READER</hi>) doo'st in present thinke of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, and what minde thou bringest with thee, as I know not, so (howsoeuer) I may yet say a little in this place, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that which is spoken throughout my whole Booke,
<pb facs="tcp:14737:8"/>
to the same purpose, considering the generall state of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons touching them, that thou mai'st the rather be induced to thinke thy diligence in perusall of the whole, not ill-emploid; or I, in thy riper, and sounder iudgment stand the more iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, or at leastwise the lesse condemned for hauing taken so much paine to pleasure thee.</p>

            <p>For in them (I may without racking the value affirme) are all the <hi>Thems,</hi> and <hi>Theorems</hi> of generous knowledges, from whence doth breath so sweet an aër of humanity as thy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners cannot but take, and mix thereby with true gentility, and noblesse.</p>
            <p>The outward parts of her palace are beautifide with infinit obiects full of all variety &amp; comlinesse: the walks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; mazes which she vseth are those enwrapped circles of ingenuous sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which the learned do entitle <hi>CYCLOPAEDIE</hi>: her Presence, and most inward retirements haue all the most <hi>CHRISTIAN,</hi> Haeroick, and Cardinall virtues, &amp; for Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maides excellent affections, without which the arguments, &amp; externall testimonies of noblesse are nothing worth.</p>
            <p>Hee that in the trust of any auditories ignorance, or base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse shall say, <hi>All this is vaine,</hi> must be answered, that this is no otherwise <hi>vaine</hi> then as <hi>Omnia vanitas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In any other good or honorable sense thou canst not (<hi>I</hi> thinke) but confesse <hi>that Armorie is a Maiesty worthy thy seruice:</hi> wherevnto if <hi>names of men,</hi> rather then <hi>things themselues</hi> can perswade, thou canst not bee vnknowing how many of our late, and presently both greatest, and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest haue heretofore, and now in present doe honor it.

if the other do not descend, it is only through a faile, or fault in the bearer: But, how-soeuer, if they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer not the rules of Armory (a word of large con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and comprehension) and that also with such Analogie as the qualities of circumstances do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire (in which the reason of bearing liues, and whereof the skill is properly an appurtenance of symbolicall phylosophy, which handleth the causes and misteries of Armes) all the rest are nothing.</p>

                  <p>Certainly, the GREEKES, with whom hath bin the vniuersall Staple of antiquities (for, as for the LATINS (who but as it were a while since came to be learned) they haue not much, and the SYRIAN, CALDEAN, and more profoundly learned AEGYP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIAN (as the people, among whom the HEBREVVS, Gods owne Scholers, dwelt) haue little obuious) do heere, and there, make famous commemoration of Shields, and Crests.</p>

                  <p>They do. But those deuises were, for the more part, arbitrary, not armorially formall. For, neither had ACHILLES shield in HOMER, nor that more artificiall one (if it bee lawfull to commit two such Poets together) of AENEAS in VIRGIL, any thing, almost, of that which Armorists call a coate, and whereof we entreate, but were rather, certain places of Art, for disposition, &amp; conueiance, where the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets tooke occasion to vtter some maiesticall inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by way, either of abridgment, induction, recapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:14737:14"/>
or the like. Nor let any one imagin, that AGAMEMNONS deuise (or other described by HOMER) was precisely a faire coat of armes, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse you would take some one, or two principall things of many; and the like is to bee said of those in VIRGIL.

                  <p>Perhaps so; for there are not wanting, who do say that almost before the flowd, such a Prince, commonweale, or Kingdome bare such, and such a Shield, or painted Symboll.

                     <hi>The vniuersality of the vse of Ensignements, or of ennoblishing by outward notes,</hi> is not hardly proued. Let the ciuil worlds, and people passe, as in the which it may truly be obiected, that there (like other ornaments) they might be perhaps excogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and reflect wee but vppon <hi>Tramountain</hi> anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, or the state of people, and things such as they were in their first rudenesse, as the surest Test, and Touch to trye this proposition by, nothing then will wee bee more demonstrable. For, from pole to pole, and ouer the whole globe ordaind for the dwellings of men, no people is so forlorne, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords not proofe to this point, nor that as it were by a contagion, or taking from one and other, but meerely out of <hi>Common notion,</hi> which concluding the necessity of outward distinctions (for how o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise shall the Soueraigne bee knowne from the subiect, or one worthy subiect from another? &amp; my hope is that no man will be so super-paradoxall, as to deny a subordination in nature among men, and differences of degrees, and states, as there are of vse, and merit) by that <hi>Naturall light</hi> disposeth of those shapes which imagination tendreth for vsefull, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:14737:17"/>
that also with some Analogy betweene the quality of the person bearing, and the ensigne borne. For when wee talke of Barbarous nations, no man of any iudgement depriues them of their resonable part, though they want elegancie, and ciuill formes, or knowledges. This therefore being a matter fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling necessarily into common sense, and vse, hee were very vnmindefull of the honour of our crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who shold imagine that any people (how bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish soeuer) could be without <hi>ensignement, &amp; seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall externall notes,</hi> and those also (out of the same naturall ground) not wanting the Analogy, and proportion whereof wee formerly spake. Which wee may gather by the names among the sauage INDIANS, those of their Princes, and peers being found to beare lofty significations, but the vulgar not so. And so farre forth doth nature instruct men to be obseruant hereof, that the very CANIBALS (An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropophages, or Men-eaters of AMERICA) are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues by the names of cruel beastes. Hence it is that you shall not truely read, or heare, that among any barbarous, the Lions skin, or like spoiles of the nobler creatures, are the indument of an ordinary groome; or that euery common soldier doth weare such feather, colour, or other distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with those of prime quality. So, HOLATA OV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINA (interpreted (I thinke) King of Kings) in FLORIDA was painted red, and none but he were so coloured, saue onely some such choyse young soldiers as were of principall agility. Common sense tells the rudest nations, that names of high
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:14737:18"/>
signification (such as glorious starre, light of the world, lamp of glorie, or as of ther Gods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, as was vsed in MEXICO, where all the noble had denomination of some one, or other of their Idols) do no way sort with a worthlesse groundling, or ignoble companion. But of this (as a secret foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of true Armories, and not the least mystery in the wisdome of nature, taught vs in <hi>Symbolicall Philosophie,</hi> in which the matter of armes is truely comprehended) elsewhere. Hereby it is (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture) cleared, <hi>that the notion is vniuersall,</hi> and therefore <hi>natural,</hi> and againe (turning but as it were the tables) <hi>we may say naturall and therefore vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall.</hi> Many fest examples whereof it were not hard to depourtray vnto you out of the Barbarous worlds; the same being no lesse verifiable in the ciuill. And from this <hi>common notion; imprest in nature, Armes, or Armories</hi> (the present matter of our conference) claime their parentage.</p>

                  <p>Indeed they cannot giue much, for they are notes of vassallage, not of honor, therefore Armes (I hope) haue no such originall.</p>

                  <p>As they are such notes I giue them not to you for an originall of Armes. But, if from hence you graunt, that in nature there are notes of disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, it followes indiuisibly, that in nature there are notes of honor, &amp; then the game, and set is vp. For (as I said not long since before in this very case of Ennoblishments, and Brandings, or Embasures) <hi>Of contraries the reason is the same.</hi> Neuerthelesse, that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:14737:20"/>
you may not suspect the cause bare, or barren by the thrift of my dealing vpon so spare, and thinne proofes, I will for honor thereof breifly see what the dusty priuat cabanet of my former Muses keepes in store of their Vniuersity-gleanings, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to late promise, beginning with EVROP, and at home. In our BRITAIN the nation of the BRIGANTS (beside whatsoeuer their Ensigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments else) had shields painted blew, according to the knowne <note place="margin">— <hi>Caeruleos Scuta Briga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </hi>
                     </note> verse in SENECA his deification of CLAVDIVS NERO, as the GERMAN ARII (saith CORNELIVS TACITVS) had shields pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted blacke. And by all antiquity it is apparent, that blew was not the colour of the BRIGANTS only, but of all the BRITANS: perhaps for that (as Ilanders) they were inuironed with the like colour'd OCEAN, so (when place shall be for such coniectures) it were not vaine to pretend that they also bare shields dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished with markes of honor, as the TROIANS, and at TROY they did. If at least-wise it be true (as DIODORVS SICVLVS to the great glory of the BRITANS doth write) that they liued after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the old heroes at TROY, giuing for instance thereof their fighting out of chariots, as those De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migods, and ILIAN worthyes did. Which gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Chariot-fights of the BRITANS, CESAR himselfe doth set forth as a forme of a battle very dreadfull, braue, and ieopardous. Blew therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Symbolicall to the BRITANS, and granting to them (to whom the renowned DRVIDS were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptors, and Priests, as BARDS their Poets) which cannot bee denied to the meerest Sauages,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:14737:21"/>
that is, but the power of that naturall, and infused Analogie which was spoken-of not long before, what can be more probable then that they had se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall figures, or tricks of painting? The naked IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIANS (though but in one colour, and vpon their bodies) had so of late, and the AGATHYRSIANS of old. Of whom though VIRGIL saith only they were painted, yet AMMIANVS MARCELLINVS showes the manner how. Poore, and silly was the deuise indeed. For their noble (saith he) had broad, and thick spotts painted on their bodies, their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble, small, and thin. How else could blew from blew (as among the BRITANS) distinguish one from another in a multitude? or black from black? as among the ARII of GERMANIE. To auoide all this, you will perhaps deny they could drawe, or trick, how rudely soeuer. GILDAS, the graue BRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAN writes, that some of the old BRITISH Idols drawne vpon walls, which hee names
<q>Patriae portenta,—lineamentis deformibus.</q>
were in his time (being aboue one thousand yeares since) seene remaining. Therefore they had draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (such as it was) before their birth in CHRIST, which was with the soonest. Spelling all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now, it seemes some-what hard to deny, that they vsed figures as well vpon their sheilds, as su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies, of their bodies (and that it may bee was onely among the vulgar) to ennoble, or distinguish them-selues with, as vpon their walls to honour their Gods. Certainly, if the GERMANS, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:14737:21"/>
GALLES did (which wee shall see afterward) it were then curst heart to barre the BRITANNS. <hi>Theodore de Brye,</hi> in his Prints of VIRGINIA, giues vs two antique figured PICTS (old inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of BRITTAIN) a man, and a woman. Of what credit they are I know not, if they be of none, yet should a Poet stumble at <hi>Decorum</hi> to present them otherwise, for so much as gastly, and affrighting formes correspond to the male, roses, and pleasant vinets to the female. So in AMERICA the cruell Sauages (as is said) tooke appellations to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues by naturall instinct from beasts of prey, their women from pleasant birds, fruites, blossomes, and like Sommer-workes. It now appeares to me that wee can suppose no otherwise of the BRITTAINS paintings. But I rather seeme to dispute then teach. This verse of OVID,
<q>Sed loca, vel gentes formatae mille figuris,</q>
though written by him, from among the TOME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TANS, or GETES, in his banishment, seemes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne all the barbarous, and confirmes mee in my coniecture, that the BRIGANTS, and other BRITANNS, nay all other like nations, though but vsing one colour onely (if any did) were yet in that one,
<q>—Formatae mille figuris.</q>
Neyther is there cause of wonder why the BRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GANTS
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:14737:22"/>
were famous for their blew, it being no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>familiar matter to haue a nation noted more for one thing then another. That IVLIVS CaeSAR, describing the BRITANS in generall, should say they did dye, or staine them-selues (for he graceth them not with the more artificiall tearme of painting) with woad, and not set downe the manner how the Noble among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> were distinguisht in that smea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or otherwise, who can maruaile? seeing he speakes not a word of the forme of their weapons, nor whether they had sheildes, or no, as commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to posterity such thinges onely, as were rare and singular in them from other nations, as this, which they vsed to appeare more terrible in battle, who were otherwise generally faire, &amp; come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with yellow locks (for so I thinke you will vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d LVCANS <hi>epithete</hi> of the BRITANS, where he saith,

They as yet doe boast a TROIAN originall, which could not but afford them some-what of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors forms, neyther are they new in that claime, or singular; for-somuch as the ARVERNOIS in NE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RO'S time made the like challenge of a descent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a rude people vpon the Maine of GALLIA, and of a far obscurer note then the BRITANS, of whome the same Poet sung
<q>
                        <l>

                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:14737:22"/>
CESAR himself grants, that the BRITANS had coin, or money of brasse, and if engrauen stamps, why not figures vppon their bodies, or bucklers? Certainly som ensignments, or other must be assigned. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the famous CASSIVELLAVNVS, chief Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in those BRITISH warrs, should with other his associate Kings be shuffled out of the coat-cards of an Armie, all being medled together, and put as it were in rout. As if it might be thought that such, &amp; so tall resistance, as was then made when CESAR lost LAIERIVS could bee without militarie order, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal variations, and ensignes. The honor of the BRITANS (our predecessors in ALBION) hath made mee almost a litle eager; but not so far yet, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse great CESAR of an ambition to deliuer vs the most grizly, &amp; coursest shapes only; though glory, wee all know, was with him no ordinary Goddesse, and such would best serue his turne with the people of ROME, for the honor of his attempt, &amp; triumph, which I will not like a POMPEIAN extenuate with

Yet some signe else, declaring his Nobility, would haue appeared which CEASAR minded not.

Concerning the ancient GERMANS (in whome we also speake of our renow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned SAXON ancestors, their most certaine proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, for which cause we likewise marshal them next, rather then the GALLS) most manifest is that place in the booke which CORNELIVS TACITVS left vnto

vs of their Manners, where, in their generall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription, as a matter common to the whole DVTCH name is written of them
<q>Souta lectissimis coloribus distinguunt.</q>
The sence wherof appeares to be this, that their sheildes had Arguments; which whether consisting of plain lineary ductures, &amp; diuisions (as now also is in vse vpon some Armories) or representations of creatures, or of whatsoeuer else, were (such as they were) peculiarly diuersifide with the light, and lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of most fresh, or choycest colours. For which cause I can beleeue, that HENGIST (our Founder, &amp; a Prince of GERMAN race) bare for ensigne an Horse both as his name did signifie, and as tradition tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth. And my opinion of the ancient GERMAN sheildes, grounding vpon TACITVS, is such, as right-wel agrees with their natural industry, &amp; felicity in mechanical studies. Wheras, not long after, the same great author shewes, that among this martial people none were licensed,
<q>Arma sumere,</q>
till in their Folkmote, Diet, or Councell, some of the Princes, or the parties father, or kinsman had adorned him with sheild, &amp; speare, a forward Diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour would not sticke perhaps from thence to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, that (beside the order of Knighthood) the whole present vse of Armes or Armories, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared thereby; and to solder, or tacke the coniect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure together, would adde, that

Which TACITVS in the same passage setteth downe as a cause (the other being only for his admission to bearing of Armes) for the Prince to bestow some honorable office, or command. As if the <hi>epitheton</hi>

<q>Insignis <hi>beene</hi> insignita</q>

Surely those sheildes of the GERMANS (whither painted before they were deliuered to their bearers, or afterward vpon occasion of some merit) beeing not assumed but solemnely, &amp; then, eyther at the Princes own hand (as when perhaps the party had no Armories, but was to receiue them of his gift) or at the hand of a father, or a kinseman (as where perhaps the right of bearing signes of honor was hereditary) it were very strange not to grant, that those sheildes, distinguisht with choisest colours (as is said al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready) had not some peculiar, and set deuises; as wel as, or rather then in general

<q>—Scutis protecti corpora longis.</q>
That the barbarous (so reputed by the GREEKS, and ROMANS) wore painted armours is very ordinarily found among the old Poets, so the PHARSALIAN writer mentioneth of the LINGONS
<q>—Pictis <hi>LINGONES</hi> armis,</q>
but VIRGIL the most learned, happy, and iudicious of all ROMAN Poets in his

If you suspect that it was for defence, not distinction, doubt you not but that the noblest La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies among them had the most dreadfull helmets. The AMAZONS had also a peculiar kind of round sheild called <hi>Pelta,</hi> and, we should be very strict, if allowing to them of LIBYA the like, we should deny
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:14737:27"/>
them distinctiue notes. CLAVDIANVS (most neat, and courtly Poet) reports in general of the AFRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CANS, that their caskes or helmes were of such stuffe,
<q>Serpentum gestant patulos pro casside rictus.</q>
The wordes in him sound thus much; that they arm'd their heades with the heades of those hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous monsters. But I could rather suppose that they were the crests of their Nobles, &amp; that the shutting-vp of the wearers heads in the sloughs, spoiles or cases of serpents, is but a Poeticall finenesse. STA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIVS (most neare imitator of incomparable VIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIL) saith of the PARTHIANS
<q>
                        <l>Ore ferarum,</l>
                        <l>Et rictu horrificant galeas —</l>
                     </q>
which beeing rightly mark't confirmes my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture, for it seemes they drew the skinnes flead from the heads of sauage beasts, ouer their hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets, to make them appeare more terrible: For otherwise I should suppose that the scalp of a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping beast, would proue both a brittle, and vneasie head-peece, and their hides a worse. In this part of the world stood the dangerous great riuall Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to ROME, CARTHAGE, whose Cittizens, and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects were so magnificent, and sumptuous in the matter of ensignments, as that in ASDRVBALS Campe, when hee was slaine, and the Campe was

The ancient AEGYPTIANS (sharers in AFRICAN foyle) afford so great proofe for our purpose, as some learned (PIERIVS for one) haue held that wee deduce our armories from their Hieraticall figures, or sacred sculptures, though it be farre otherwise: Yet is it not to be denied that some Armories haue beene euen copyed by Hierogrammes, or coyned out of them, &amp; armories indeed, as wel as, or rather then Impreses ought to taste of them, for that they are mute bodies only without any Mott, or Word to enspirit them. The famous transfigurations of PROTEVS King of AEGIPT, were not fained vppon other ground (witnesse all Mythologers) then his frequent shifting of crestes, and ensignes of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty. Nor was it singular in him, if (as SVIDAS writes) GERYON was fabled to haue three heads, for that hee wore three crestes. But the AFRICANS in generall had painted sheilds, and by a proper name called <hi>cetrae,</hi> as the AMAZONIAN were named <hi>pettae.</hi> Of these AFRICAN discoloured sheilds, the noble-borne, and thrice-honorable SILIVS sung,
<q>Versicolor contrà cetra—</q>
which sheilds, onely a litle chang'd, they at this day retaine, and engraue, or paint with sundry formes. To bee short, examine the first state, &amp; face of

True it seemes to bee that the MEXICAINS were a later nation, comming from Countries very Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly (Seminary indeed of new plantations, but not of ciuil inuentions) as true also that the OTTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIES, &amp; CHICHEMECAS dwelt-there before, and by the NAVATALCAS (now MEXICAINS, whome a man by their ciuill fashions would iudge to haue beene a Colony long since out of CHINA) were displan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.

To this purpose the names of the barbarous answring the Analogie of nature in their significations, and the brands of the VIRGINIANS pointed vnto by you, suting the practise of the ROMANS, are very pertinent. In EVROP I see the azure targats of the BRITANS, and allow your well-grounded diuinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that they had other, and those lineamentall, or figured distinctions. Much the rather, for that you haue inuincibly confirm'd vnto me, that the GALLS, and GERMANS had.

The famous CAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THAGENIANS rise with honour, and allowance there-vnto. Nor are the most ancient MIZRAIM, or AEGYPTIANS, second to any, and PROTEVS cannot there so disguise, and transfigure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe as to escape the vse you put him to; all AFRICANS subscribing.

But Epicures (O good Sir EVSTACE) are not the onely renegados to the dignities of their creation, by eschewing the naturall splendor of testified vertue, and the shine which the studies of honor do illumine the soule of man with. There
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:14737:36"/>
are many factions besides. Some of which might deserue to bee recall'd, but that in the compasse of life they constitute a false center, as if wisedome were alwaies to grouell with them in immoderate cares for things of present vse, &amp; they neuer to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire to her high throne with the humble seruice of all they haue; and finally, for that they maske their neglect of Armes, &amp; of heroicke vertue it selfe (the only competent weilder of armes) vnder the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly visours of accidentall debasements, such as vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garization, disproportion, and like mosse growne vpon them in tract of time, by a fortune not more fatally theirs, then other noble knowledges. By which preiudice they mingle sacred, &amp; prophane, and proclaime new tables as it were, to all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and glory. Admit that pretious metall were dropt in into the cynders; who throws away gold for the drosse it is wrapt in? If the misteries of honor lie contemn'd in the huske, and bran of vulgarity, or of other casuall debasement, which setts foote on the necke of glory: must they to whome the protection, and profession there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of belongs runne madd with the multitude? The holy, and most maiesticall name of GOD almighty hath falne in our daies, by manifould deuolutions of impiety, into such blasphemous abuses, as wee all of vs haue lately seene it faine to bee rescued from those indignities (or sacriledges rather) by mayne act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Should that rule then bee the mesure of worth, in an age so blancke, and famously bare

of all heroick qualities, as, ours where should any beame, or smallest timber of the whole frame of virtue be seene to stand? should not Angels, Men, &amp; Things detorted, or degenerated from their first institution, be so cast of? And should not so an vtter voydnesse be brought vpon humanity? Therefore the rise, or fal of mens opinions concerning things which borrow not their value by estimation, as Pearle, and Stone, but containe it in themselues, as Wisdome, &amp; Virtue, are but a very Carpenters beuill, a false, leaden, and LESBIAN rule to mesure by, and the redy way (in constituting multitudes our iudges) to assubiect our selues to the worst tribunal of the world, <hi>meere popularity.</hi> As for the rust, or fog of contempt which sitts thick vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, &amp; all other generous science, Honor hath long supplicated Maiesty for an hand to mount by, and cannot bee euer without it. Meane while, no iniquity of men, or times can giue from vs, to enioy the secret nourishment of noble thoughts, without imprudently slightng the present sway (though of most corrupted iudgements) or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out frailty contemning our selues. For we are such, and so taught, as must not like chap-men aske how the market goes, thereby to lay out our time vpon a parcell of vertue, or honor, so, as wee may in a <hi>mount-banke</hi> fashion gaine an opinion by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile thereof aboue our value, but really embrace it for it selfe, and earnestly fauour, and foster it in others, that (if cause require) we may afford to our country, and to other our obligers, true offices,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:14737:37"/>
and not deceiuable. As for one ordinary cauill vsed by many, concerning the vulgarization of notes of honour, that certainly doth not trouble mee, for Good (simply such) is bettered in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the community thereof, and how happy were the nation which had as many noble in partes, as in markes? But it is farre otherwise, God knowes, whose, and the worke of soueraigne Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the reformation is, and not of a Satyr, wherein I haue no kind of skill, and much lesse, wil.

Mary, if you as yet be entangled, or vnsatisfied in any of the dilated praemises, let me know, for I mean not to take you into the Armorists ARGO till you see the weather vnlike to ouer-cast, at least-wise in that coast which we leaue behind.</p>

                  <p>There is no clowd in that particular horizon which you haue not clear'd my prospect fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse I hold, that my scruple concerning <hi>the naturalitie, and vniuersal practise of Ensignements</hi>
                     <pb n="60" facs="tcp:14737:39"/>
was at first iust in mee, for they (as I my selfe did) who at a glympse, or inconsiderately view the present multitudes of Armories, their formal elegancies, and setled order, which all speake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Art, would verely thinke that they were euen at the first but the worke of witte, without any spring-head to bee found for them vppon so high an ALP, as God him-selfe.</p>

                  <p>I grant, and thinke you iustifie your selfe, very seasonably. But let no man be troubled (good Syr EVSTACE) when hee beholdes the wondrous worke of Armes, (so DAEDALEAN, and so various) raised out of that one true natural ground, as if it were not the ground, for all the lights thereof are kindled (as you see) at that one ray of <hi>vniuersal no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Which neuerthelesse to weake eyes seemes wrapt vp, or rather lost in the many foldes of Art, but will most readily appeare if thus sought. For as <hi>to imitate</hi> is generally imprest in the nature of man, so picture (deriued from that property) was yet at first (notwithstanding the naturality, and vniuersality thereof) but of that kinde onely which the GRECIANS call <hi>Monogrammos,</hi> or lineary, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward from <hi>Monogrammos</hi> spread it selfe into that which PLINIE calleth <hi>Monochroma,</hi> that is to say, from consisting of one line, to consisting of one colour, and from <hi>Monochroma</hi> did by degrees ascend to such excellence, as rather more then moulding, or imagery contended with spirit, or life it selfe, and is productiue of as many seuerall formes, as the eye, or imagination hath obiects.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:14737:39"/>
Hee therefore, that by example of Picture, or of any other like flourishing inuention, which hath complement from Art, but originall from Nature, shall lift his sight ouer to the first state of things, must confesse, that the present glory, and method of Armories, no more then of those other can take away the grant of a ground, fountaine of the one and of the other. But in Armes we owe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more truly to nature then the very light of differencing worths by outward notes. The inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, application, and disposition notwithstanding of those notes are meerly with Art, and Vse; which two mighty Powers after a very long space of time (for excellent things are of <hi>Elephantine birth</hi>) did at last with infinite labour, and like felicitie, first gather the scattred-materials, such as <hi>that vniuersall notion of ensignement</hi> had rudely in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall ages afforded, and afterward so admirablie wrought-out perfect Symbols, and absolute Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories as wee now behold.

                  <p>BLAZON is the description of Armes, and their appurtenances, by the receiued termes, or other apt expression of things by words.</p>

                     <figure/>
is become most vsuall, and in a sort the proper, for that the shield in generall, beeing inuented for defence of the body of man, and applied there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto, carries a three-cornerd, or triquet-figure, the body of man decreasing as it were in latitude from the shoulders downeward. And as the chiefe of ROMANE historians (SALLVST) writes, that his nation borrowed their armes, and militarie wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons from the SAMNITES, so was this the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar figure of the SAMNITE sheild, as the noble Author TITVS LIVIVS PATAVINVS de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes it, and giues the reason of that shaping, to bee
<q>Mobilitatis causâ.</q>
The ROMANS digrest notwithstanding from this paterne, rather vsing Oual, Imbricate, and other figures. Heere I could create a new Worke, did I
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:14737:42"/>
take occasion to dilate of the figures of Sheilds, which were scarse the same in any two nations. POLYBIVS, and other famous writers make it cleare, that the hides of beasts were the common couerings of sheilds, the ordinarie stuffe vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath beeing some tough wood, or other, as Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and some-time for the more lightnesse, twiggs wouen, for so I vnderstand that of LVCAN.

Our SAXON ancestors vsed shields of skin, among whom for that the Artificer put sheep-fells to that purpose, the great ATHELSTANE King of ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND, vtterly forbad by a lawe such deceit, as in the printed booke of SAXON lawes is extant to bee seene.

                     </gap>, a skinne. The Triangular (or SAMNIT) was vniuersallie among vs the antient fashion of shields for men of Armes, but not the onely. For assurance where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I will delight you with two diuerse proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the one of an honorary belonging to the most renowned EDVVARD, Prince of WALES, the other (an honorarie also) appertaining to his third brother, King of CASTILE, and LeON, Duke of LANCASTER. The sayd victorious Princes toombe, is in the goodly Cathedral Church erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the honor of CHRIST in CANTERBVRIE: There (beside his quilted coat-armour with halfe-sleeues,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:14737:42"/>
Taberd-fashion, and his Triangular sheild, both of them painted with the royall Armories of our Kings, and differenced with siluer labels) hangs this kinde of Pauis, or Targat, curiously (for those
<figure/>
times) embost, and painted, the Scucheon in the bosse beeing worne out, and the Armes (which it seemes were the same with his coate-armour, and not any peculiar deuise) defaced, and is altogether of the same kinde with that, vpon which (FROISARD reports) the dead body of the Lord ROBERT of DVRAS, and nephew to the Cardinall of PIER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>REGOVRT was laid, and sent vnto that Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinall, from the battell of POICTIERS, where the Blacke Prince obtained a victorie, the
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:14737:43"/>
renowne whereof is immortall. I can hardly here containe my selfe from offring vp a duty of praise to the remembrance of this matchlesse Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Lambe in peace, Lion in warre, and of all the world in his time the most martiall Worthy, and most fortunate Generall. Aspire right excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent HENRIE (ô let it need no expiation, that thy great Fathers most lowely subiect should thus presume) by his example (to whose Title, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalitie thou art lineall successor) to things grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the example. That as thou art the proper blossome of all the royall HENRIES, and ED<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VVARDS of this thy Fathers inheritance, so wee may in thee acknowledge the summe of all their CHRISTIAN vertues, proouing thy selfe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a greater Thing then to bee the Monarch, not onely of all great BRITAINE, but of all the World.</p>
                  <p>The other honorarie shield is in the most mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Temple dedicated to the memorie of the glorious Apostle Saint PAVL in LONDON, where it hangs at the sayd Dukes Moniment, and is farre different from the first. In the curious neere view, and handling whereof, as I tooke sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular delight, so was it worthy no lesse diligence, and therefore I will heere showe you both the Figure, and Fabrick.

                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:14737:45"/>
the colour of which Crosse though NICETAS name not, yet was it in likelyhood of none other then of the same which is now in the flag of ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND (red in white) where (when it was old BRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TAIN) him-selfe a BRITAN was borne.</p>

                  <p>It may be thence it is that ENGLAND beares it in honor of him, casting the title erroniously vpon S. GEORG.</p>

                  <p>I say not absolutely so, though it is euident (according to EVSEBIVS one of CONSTANTINE'S Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops) that it appeared to him very miraculously when it was now a litle past noone, and aboue the sunne, consisting wholy of shining light, with a GREEK sentence importing victory against MAXEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIVS, and his other enimies, and that in religious, and gratefull memory therof, he bare it in his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial Standard, or LABARVM, as also in like me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of CHRISTE'S appearing to him in a vision the same night, he caused his monies to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored with symbolicall characters,

                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:14737:46"/>
as by his coyne yet extant may bee collected, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as here you see) a stamp compounded of the two first GREEK capitals in CHRISTES name.</p>
                  <p>With more vehemency of likely-hood we may affirme, that the Armories of the Ile of MANN were deriued from the semblable figure which the

                  <p>The cause in them was elegant, but nothing agreeable to the Kingdome, or Ile of MANN, though som-what to the three Realms (ENGLAND, SCOTLAND, and IRELAND) which it respects.</p>

                  <p>The three Legs meeting so in the center did
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:14737:46"/>
symbolize, or signifie the three corners, capes, or promontories of that Iland, which was therefore called TRINACRIA.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>E.</speaker>
                  <p>The cause was apt indeed, and would well correspond to our Penile of ENGLAND, which is triquet or triangular.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>It would. But surely in those monyes this was also strange, that in the very iuncture of the Legs, you should sometime see a MERCVRIES head, betokening (as it seemes) the witty arts of the Ilan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, somtime the head of CERES to signifie the fertility, or rape of PROSERPINE,
<figure/>
and some-time other things. Yea, the imitation of the like in Armories to that publike deuise of legs hath crept into priuate families, for the TREMAINS (a CORNISH, or westerne house of Gentlemen) beare three armes so disposed, the hands directed toward the angles of the Sheild. But wee haue once againe almost lost our selues.</p>

                     <hi>The Continent</hi> is left to imagination, being only so much as the <hi>Content</hi> couers, which is here the matter of the Armories, to weet, the Field, and the Lion.

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>E.</speaker>
                  <p>You taught mee before, that the <hi>Continent</hi>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:14737:48"/>
was the sheild, or thing containing, and now you say that the Field, and the Lion are the <hi>Content,</hi> which being so, then are <hi>the Content, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent</hi> (because the Field containes the Lion) either confounded, or there are two <hi>Continents,</hi> one which comprehends the whole Armories, and the other which containes a part.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>My assertion is true. For the field (that is the superficies) is no part of <hi>the Continent</hi> in my meaning, but is it selfe contained, as the Lion is: And yet your auerment is not absurd, for, seuering the Charge from the Field (which here is red) you may, and that not altogether the most improper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hold, that the Field is <hi>the Continent</hi> of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained body, be it Lion, or whatsoeuer else.</p>

                  <p>Reflect but vpon the description which I gaue you of the <hi>Continent,</hi> and there you shall learne to bring with you an abstractiue, or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicall consideration, for although a Shield, beeing a solid, and Geometricall body, hath in it three dimensions, yet know with-all that it hath a superficies as of it selfe, which is nothing to the making vp of Armories, because there-vpon may bee painted any thing else, and a shield of any matter what-so-euer, timber, mettal, horne, shell, hath nothing of a coate but onely potentially, and in power.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>E.</speaker>

                  <speaker>E.</speaker>
                  <p>We must (Sir) by imagination seuer <hi>the Content</hi>
                     <pb n="80" facs="tcp:14737:49"/>
of Armories from the matter, or thing wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they are, yet so, as by the beeing of Armories vpon it, the shield immediatly becomes the contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning part of the whole armes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>True, as I suppose. For let an Armes painted on a Surcoat, Tabard, or Shield be blotted out, the priuation of the Armories, makes no priuation of the <hi>Continent,</hi> though not as the <hi>Continent of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories,</hi> but as a substance of it selfe, and if the bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon of the coat be knowne, though by reason of that priuation it appeare not to the eye, yet to the intelligent it abideth, and preserues the notice both of the mater, and forme in the mind, though so I doe no more take it to bee an actuall Armes, then the dreame, or <hi>Idaea</hi> of a building is an house.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>E.</speaker>
                  <p>It is cleare then that <hi>the Content</hi> of a painted armes is all that whereof the eye takes view with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>the bounding line,</hi> whereof that line is a part.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>I say not so. For whither you thereby vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the <hi>purfle,</hi> or <hi>visible line,</hi> which circumscribes the whole, as a <hi>perimeter,</hi> and is drawne with Pen, Penicil, or howsoeuer: or whether you only meane that inuisible, imaginarie ducture, hauing neither bredth, nor depth, nor is separable from the thing in which it is imagined, I cannot directly affirme, that it is any more a part of an Armes, then a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munis terminus</hi> is of that which went before, or of that which came after; or then the vnexpressable point of time which diuides the new yeare from the old, is a portion of the new, or of the old: The <hi>bounding line</hi> (in my conceit) being common
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:14737:49"/>
as well to the <hi>Continent,</hi> as to the <hi>Content.</hi>

                  <p>Where the errour breeds no danger, it is best there to follow common opinion, and seeing these things are not wont to be so narrowly sifted, it is enough to take it, as it is most vsually taken.</p>

                     <hi>Armorial Lines</hi> are in their first diuision <hi>Straight,</hi> or <hi>Crooked.</hi>
                     <figure/>

                     <figure/>
More-ouer the <hi>Oblique</hi> are either <hi>straight,</hi> or <hi>croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.</hi> The <hi>Crooked</hi> are sub-diuided infinitely, but the more vsual, and vniuersall may bee reduced to these heads, that is, <hi>circular, angular, wauing,</hi> and <hi>mixt,</hi> and briefly are all such as are not <hi>straight.</hi> But before you proceed any farther, my charity cannot forbeare to giue you here a cautel for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uention of straying from my sense, and one error not met-with in the beginning, multiplies it selfe into innumerable. Therefore when we speake of <hi>Armorial Lines</hi> eyther here, or any where, I do not meane of them otherwise then as of terminations, or common limits of Armorial bodies; and when we say lines are <hi>straight</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or <hi>crooked,</hi> of this, or that forme, I pray vnderstand that I meane the Armori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al bodies which they terminate are such. For though Lines are the inseperable circumscriptions
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:14737:53"/>
of formes, or figures in sheilds, as of sheilds them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, giuing them (at least-wise to our sight) <hi>to Bee,</hi> yet it is the body, or space comprehended which casts them out into the extremities, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they become their visible limits, which albeit we are enforced in flat pictures, and plaine tables to expresse by lines, yet in carued, or embossed ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects of armes, no other lines are drawne then such, as the body it selfe so cut, embost, or carued, terminates our sight with, which lines shift with our station. Doubtlesse, in the <hi>Idaea,</hi> or mentall shape before it come as it were into act, by beeing painted, cut, or carued, those terminating, and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Mathematical</hi> lines, abstractedly considered, are manifest, adhering (or inhering rather) without any possibility of separation from the conceaued Image. Whereas also the lines drawne in the former coats (for they are coats of Armes, very faire, and good, as well as examples of <hi>Lines</hi>) seem to apportion the said coats, yet are they (I meane the parted, and diuers-colour'd moities of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall sheilds) but seuerall solid peeces, or faces of differently colour'd bodies, meeting in such a seam of separation (in my conceit of them) as necessarily produce, and present vnto vs such, or such a line. Neuerthelesse for more familiar perspicuity in teaching, I am to retain to speake as the vulgar, without daring to vse the more penetrating point of spirit, it being also not in the skil of man to draw a line (how admirably smal soeuer) without any la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, such as the subtility of the <hi>Mathematicks</hi>

expected habits of Noblesse?</p>
                  <p>So much the rather, for that the pleasing aspect of Armories, and signes of honor in them repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting some meaning or other, the spectators rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily know not what, procures a delight, and so prepares the mind with a willingnesse to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed.

                  <p>All colours vpon occasion bee vsed in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mories, as the thing which is to bee painted doth require. Therfore all <hi>colours</hi> are <hi>armoriall</hi> in the largest sense, which you may easily perceiue in those sheildes, where the <hi>Charge</hi> being of seuerall colours (as a <hi>Peacock,</hi> a <hi>Culuer,</hi> a <hi>Cameleon,</hi> a <hi>Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow,</hi>

or the like) is set forth according to life, which as seldome, so it is of little grace in Armory, whose liking is chiefly of those which beeing principall, and <hi>Colours</hi> as it were of them-selues are withall most different one from the other. Of them (as the humors of this artificiall bodie) it is enough if we deale onely with such as are most noble, and vsuall, which are <hi>seauen.</hi> For that the bearing of things in their proper colours should be best, as it is I confesse somewhat commonly held, so is it a common errour, and but among the Commons, because those of the Vpper-house of skill know it is far otherwise, the reasons of Armes, and Nature being so different. A blew, or greene Lyon (which are as improper colours for that beast as can bee) are of better bearing then a naturall: How-beit if that vulgar conceit haue any ground, it is in the vse of the praedominant colour of a creature whose image is borne in Armories; as a golden Lyon ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then any other, because <hi>Yellow</hi> is praedomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant in him.</p>
                  <p>So that at most it can be said, That creature is best borne, or borne in his most dignity, which is aduanced in the praedominant colour thereof, which also I must demurre vppon, for I beleeue it not yet, and the reason will appeare elsewhere, for this is but by the way,</p>

them is so diuerse, and in the march of Armes to rrespasse against true Marshalling is an errour which I am not willing to committe. To make Antiquity arbitresse of this difference will perhaps not serue, because custome (which hath domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ouer matters of this kind) hath preuayled to the contrary, our whole speech being but of the chief armoriall colours. PLATO (laying <hi>White</hi> aside, as a sacred colour, and symbolicallie reserued to the seruice of powers diuine) leaues all the rest vnto vs for militarie Ensignes. Among the ROMANS it had signification of soueraignty it selfe, for (as it is in SVETONIVS) a crowne of laurel bound-vp with a label, or riband of white, and set vpon a statue of the first perpetuall Dictator IVLIVS CEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAR, the Tribunes commanded the said lace, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel to be taken away, and the fellow to bee put in prison, as one who had therein gone about to erect a King, and so far as was in him proclaymed CEASAR; a matter as then high treason against the State. DOMITIAN in like sort for that his brothers sonne in law had
<q>Albatos ministros.</q>

                  <p>Of these and the like were no end, and yet the present controuersie of praecedence in colours should rest vndecided.Which if any man shall despise, hee doth not know that nothing is of so smal moment (which I speake not as a matter for men to bee proud of, or wherein they haue cause to glory) which is fit for vs Mortals to contemne, whose most weighty enterprizes by a colour,

                  <p>Very lately in BARBARY a white skarcrow was ynough to start an Emperour from his imperiall seat, and make him to flye. Thus it hapned. In the late famous furies of that country betweene the three brethren, HAMET BOSONNE their cousin made head for him-selfe, and drew toward MAROCCO or MORVECOS the principal citty, not far from from which, ABDELA lay in camp, from whence a fellow being seen vppon an hil with a spear in his hand,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:14737:74"/>
and a <hi>white linnen</hi> vpon it as a flag, the Emperour ABDELA thought HAMET BOSONNE to bee at hand with his whole force, where-vpon in al hast taking vp som of his Tents, but the greater part left stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, he fearefully ranne away: And what was this terrible apparition do you imagine? a poore MORE washing his napery, and for the speedier drying thereof vsing his speare to hang it in the sunne. Let examples passe: who sees not the naturall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of colours? At the approach of light whose senses are not cheared? In darknesse who feeles not a kinde of horror? Haue the <hi>White</hi> of a delicate face, and the <hi>blacknesse</hi> of a NEGRO alike admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to our eye? or allowance in the minde? What innumerable affections are raised in the soule by colours, all admirers of beauty can tell, and I see not what the pride of life is more ambitious in, or studious for, witnesse the maruaylous valuations of pearle, and stone (chiefly for the various shine of their colors, their luster, or water as they cal it) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pompe of cloathes, the ornament of building, and innumerable other: All which are vnto the blind worth nothing indeed, but to those who haue the vse of sight, a maine cause why they desire to liue and bee.</p>

                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:14737:75"/>In the marshalling of <hi>armorial colours</hi> two consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations therfore I recommend vnto you: The first is as they are colours naturally, the second as they be of estimation in respect of things represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. In the first consideration <hi>white,</hi> and <hi>black</hi> are by all the more learned, agreed vppon as chiefe: So PLATO, so ARISTOTLE, so to conclude, all Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siologers teach; But I teach not you with IVLIVS SCALIGER to taxe great ARISTOTLE, for saying that <hi>blacke was the priuation of white.</hi> These two colours, as they are most different, so haue they their seueral excellencies awarded, as the heads, or common parents from which all the rest are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in greater, or lesse proportion, answerable to their participation with eyther. In the second consideration, colours are to be respected as they represent other things, in which regard <hi>white</hi> hath not praecedence. This distinction is insisted vpon by the most renowned <hi>Ciuilian,</hi> BARTOLVS, in that little treatise which he lest vnto vs of Armes, and Ensignes, occasioned perhaps for that him-selfe had this coat-armour
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:14737:75"/>
                     <figure/>
giuen to him by the Emperour <hi>Carolus Quartus</hi> of whose priuie Councell hee was, and is the first of Gown-men whom we shall readily finde (as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue) that had honor done vnto him in that kind, which was but in the yeare of our Lord God, MCCCXLVII. To swearue from his authority vpon greater reason, or authoritie, can carry with it the lesse note, for that hee was a Lawyer, not an Armorist, and for that him-selfe suruiued not the publication thereof, which was done by his sonne-in-law after his death, and therefore may seeme to haue wanted the last perusal. And this (for honor of the man) I thought to fore-warne, least (as may fall out) wee should in some things decline his iudgment, as not onely in marshalling the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen chiefe Armoriall colours, but in other things likewise, wherein (wee presume) his speculations were not beyond all others.

About the place of metals there is no altercation, for all giue praecedence to gold, as to the more worthy mettall, but about the colours they varie: For VPTON assignes the third place to <hi>Azure,</hi> which LEIGH, and SCOHIER doe poste into the fourth: VPTON enstalleth <hi>gules</hi> in the fourth; LEIGH, and SCOHIER in the third: <hi>Purple,</hi> according to VPTON is fifth, but according to LEIGH and SCOHIER, seauenth.

                     <hi>White</hi> certainly is in his proper nature most excellent, as being most pure and splendent.

                  <p>There is no doubt but that VPTON with good iudgment did marshall it so, considering his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of their order in nature. For <hi>redde</hi> bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him the meane, and equidistant colour

in the said order, betweene the two extreames of <hi>white,</hi> and <hi>black,</hi> what can bee more aptly placed then <hi>purple</hi> next to <hi>red</hi>? for somuch as <hi>purple</hi> hath in it a kind of deepnesse, which makes it incline to a degree of <hi>black.</hi>

                  <p>Then you preferre his iudgment before LEIGHS in the first consideration, though it should seeme that euen his <hi>Scale</hi> also doth not meerly, and purely answer the said consideration, forsomuch as <hi>white,</hi> being according to nature, the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent of <hi>colours,</hi> hath not priority of <hi>yellow,</hi> which it ought to haue, being of it selfe pondred, VPTON respecting the honour of the metall which <hi>yellow</hi> representeth, or in which it is represented, and therefore his marshalling is not simply naturall.</p>

                  <p>Your obseruation is true, and by the leaue of <hi>Ciuilians</hi> (an order of men which rightly institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is able and worthy to gouerne the world) I will adde somewhat farther concerning BARTO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LVS: who making his distinction of <hi>colours</hi> as we haue done, and first (which also factious me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodists would carpe as preposterous) declaring which colours are in his opinion most noble in respect of things which they represent, insteed of prosecuting the other member of his diuision, that is to say, insteed of showing which colours
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:14737:78"/>
are most noble in respect of themselues, makes some of vs doubt whether hee hath therein per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed any thing at all, or not confounded the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond member with the formost. For comming to that point thus hee disputes, <hi>as light is most noble</hi> (saith hee) <hi>so her contrary, which is darkenesse, is most base,</hi> then in colours as they are to bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as of them-selues, (for that is the point)
<q>Color albus est nobilior quia magis appropinquat luci.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>If therefore (ô renowned BARTOLVS) <hi>white</hi> is more noble, (as you affirme) for the more nearenesse which it hath to light, then it is not in respect of it selfe more noble, but in respect of that more neerenesse (that is, in respect of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) and so wee seeme to bee forsaken by you in this second point: For neither is light, nor dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse a <hi>colour,</hi> nor measuring causes of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of <hi>colours,</hi> nor was it the question which of them two was most noble, but whether this, or that colour. Yea, a curious sister might hazard all the first diuision by this, or make a fight betweene them, I meane betweene the first, and this: For if there bee but one rule of praecedence in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, as they are considerable in respect of things which they resemble, or allude vnto ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the first diuision, then eyther <hi>white</hi> is chiefe euen in that respect, and to bee preferred before <hi>golden, purple,</hi> and <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zure,</hi> contrary to the collection which hee makes,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:14737:79"/>
or this is no apt resemblance which is brought by him of <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>darkenesse.</hi> But if there are two rules of such praecedencie, then certainly, colours as they are considerable in respect of others, are to bee considered after a double manner, euen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the first diuision, the one manner superior, the other inferior, and the second consideration which is of colours as they are of themselues is to bee sought out in naturall Philosophie, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance, nor allusions.

                  <p>You may wel say it was peculiar indeed, when in the phrase of IVSTINIANS CODE, the shel-fish wherein it grew is called <hi>sacer murex,</hi> and the crime of vsing it in cloak, or other garment by an imperiall edict dated at CONSTANTINOPLE equalled to treason, and the appropriation thereof to them of the bloud only, is honored therin with no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, nor lesse holy a word the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Dedication,</hi> which yet is but according to the Analogie of the whole vse, if the colour were sacred, nay; if I forget not great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the State therein grew so precise, that to vse but guards, laces, or strings dipt with that die was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall, though the great and glorious Emperour IVSTINIAN remitted the rigour of those Edicts made by his praedecessors.</p>
                  <p>The reason why it hath lost praecedence is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause we haue lost the colour it-selfe, since (as som thinke) the TVRKS haue come into possession of the fishings at TYRE, and other places where the <hi>Welks</hi> or <hi>Shel-fish</hi> grew in which <hi>purple</hi> was found, or
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:14737:80"/>
because though the fish bee not extinguished, yet the Art it selfe of drawing, and keeping it is vtterly perisht: For it is not (GOD knowes) that bastard die which is in <hi>Grocers turnsol,</hi> a mixture of <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>million,</hi> and <hi>blew-bysse,</hi> or <hi>cynaber,</hi> or the colour in violets, but a most pretious, bright and admirable; which (saith PANCEROLLVS) is now to bee onely ghest at in the ITALIAN ielliflowre, &amp; seemes not in some iudgements to bee that of the <hi>Amethist,</hi> but that of the <hi>Rubie, Pyropus</hi> or <hi>Carbuncle,</hi> or (as saith BARTOLVS) of Elementall fire, or rather of the Empyraean heauen it selfe.</p>
                  <p>If the true, and TYRIAN purple were not lost, I perceiue you would not feare to aduance it in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie aboue <hi>white</hi> and <hi>yellow,</hi> that is aboue the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals in Armories, <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>siluer.</hi>

                  <p>I will tell you. Nothing is more plaine (as I suppose) then that <hi>blacke</hi> is, as it were, the <hi>basis</hi> or <hi>pedestal</hi> of colours, and <hi>white</hi> the crown-point, or toppe, there being a kinde of leuitie, beside pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the one, and an heauinesse, or obscurity in the other, <hi>white</hi> (according to books, and reason) being capable of all colours, and <hi>black</hi> contayning all. And if in this speculation we may faine a <hi>sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum,</hi> and <hi>deorsum,</hi> an ascence, and descence, an as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring, and rest, a center and a summitie, the same must needs hold very well in <hi>black,</hi> and <hi>white,</hi> and in the relations which intermedious colours haue in their distances, and mixtures with eyther. VPTONS scale therefore (sauing in the praecedence of <hi>yellow</hi> before <hi>white</hi> for the cause before sayd) is best fitted to the order of Nature. You might aske now why the order of Nature should not also be the order of Honor, and Dignity.</p>
                  <p>But if that were so then among al other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruities, <hi>sable</hi> as it is the <hi>basis,</hi> or foote of colours, so should it also bee the basest in Armories, which BARTOLVS (ignorant of Armorial speculations, for now I am compelled to go so farre) doth not stick to affirme.</p>

                  <p>Then, as in nature there is no excellencie but in extremes, and as the final cause of Armes is one principall rule of excellence in <hi>Armorie, white</hi> beeing the one extreme, <hi>black</hi> the other; More-ouer the finall cause of <hi>Armes</hi> borne open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the field, or else-where, beeing manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where <hi>black</hi> for the solemne deepnesse there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is a colour altogether as far to bee seene, if not farther then <hi>white,</hi> for which cause also <hi>black,</hi> and

                  <p>I could with a very good will step aside heere into a question, or two if you would allow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, vpon occasion of this double-headed Bird, for that though you hold it so excellent, yet to mee (in the rudenesse of my nouiceship) it seemes monstrous and vnnaturall.</p>

                  <p>I maruaile not if it doe: But this example
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:14737:82"/>
may confirme vnto you that saying which I but lately vsed, to weet, <hi>that the reasons of Armorie, and Nature are seuerall,</hi> in the one signification is lookt for, proprietie in the other. You cannot but haue heard the cause of this Bearing. The Eagle was the Ensigne of a Legion, and as you may say the Standard, vnder which many <hi>signa,</hi> or inferior (Banners wee cannot call them) but Ensignes did march, as belonging to the seuerall bands, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of Soldiers comprehended in that Legion. The Eagle was also the Symbol, and receiued Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roglyphick (so to say) or Armes of the Empire, which being diuided by the Emperour CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTINE (vpon the translation of the Imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all seate from ROME to CONSTANTINOPLE) into the East, and West Empire, gaue cause (as it is in tradition) of bearing this IOVIAL bird thus augmented with the addition of a neck, and head, as looking to the two opposite coasts of the RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANE world. Howbeit I do not wonder if to you it seeme vnkindly, and prodigious, hauing read in an Epistle of BEATVS RHENANVS, that some did heretofore labour the Emperour MAXIMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAN, to abolish the bearing of the double-headed Eagle for euer, as a monster, but that (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe is) some were found wiser then some, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the sacred ROMANE Empire was preserued from being spoild by the ignorance of a few, of an Ensigne, or Symbol so renowned. I could rather wonder at this Shield,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:14737:83"/>
                     <figure/>
wherein also is an Eagle like to the former, and found engrauen in the column of ANTONINVS at ROME, which column was raised long before CONSTANTINE was borne, or any such diuision of the Empire thought vppon, or thought more tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable then it was in the old common-weal to leaue old ROME for ALBA.</p>
                  <p>IVSTVS LIPSIVS thinks that the soldier (for it was a priuate deuise) who bare this sheild, was of a Legion made out of two, for that two Eagles seem mixt as it were in one, nor haue I in present any better coniecture to bring, though I would hee had deliuered his conceipt what the Crowne ouer it might meane.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:14737:83"/>Neuerthelesse it should appeare, that the motion which RHENANVS speakes of, was not then first made, for the Armories of FRIDERICK the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, reuiued among the rest at WESTMINSTER and there written Emperour, haue it but with one head, and the same seemes alike antiently painted, or stained in the glasse window ouer it, and this was in the reigne of HENRY the third King of ENGLAND, about foure hundrerh yeeres past: Other take it to proceed out of the engrauers er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, or that hee was onely King of ROMANS at the time of the Armories there cut, or painted, and consequently in right thereof had onely the Eagle with the single head, but afterward (the writing being more easily changed then the sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) the Armories remaining still the same, hee had the title of Emperour added, as that which had accrewed to him after their affixation, or setting there. But I may not tolerate these or the like di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions: You see therefore (contrary to Doctor BARTOLVS) the cause why <hi>Black,</hi> though the <hi>basis</hi> of colours, is not yet the basest colour, but shares with <hi>white,</hi> or hath the next roome there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto.</p>

                  <p>They haue their Turnes, and I forget them not.

As for <hi>vert</hi> (in which word (as in the other of <hi>sable, azure, gules,</hi> are onely, and properly vnderstood the <hi>black, blew,</hi> and <hi>redde</hi> peculiar to Armories onely) is meant the <hi>greene</hi> vsed in armes-painting, or which ought to bee vsed, and is the very best) that is as rarely found in Coat-armours, as <hi>gules</hi> is often found: and yet <hi>Purple,</hi> aswell for the reasons beforesaid, as because (for so it seemes) the whole honor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was transferred to <hi>gules,</hi> more rarely in our ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LISH bearings, hachments, or notes of honor: Which is notwithstanding no disreputation to either. <hi>Vert</hi> in Armories hath alwayes had the betokning of a ioyous, youthly, fresh, &amp; flourishing

state of bearing, and is therefore in that respect aduanced to the honour of a <hi>superlatiue, uert</hi> in <hi>or,</hi> being entituled most ioyous.

<q>His shield it was of gold so red,</q>
And this common conceit made MANVVOOD Lord chiefe Baron, call golden coyne (as I haue heard reported) by an alluding by-name <hi>Ruddocks</hi>; and finally, <hi>gules</hi> therefore is suffered to praecede, for that most properly it resembleth MARS, and is most aptly appliable to martiall behoofes: That it is a childe, or neere cozen to <hi>yellow</hi> (as <hi>azure</hi> is of <hi>white</hi>) may bee manifested thus, forsomuch as to abate, and allay the fulnesse of <hi>red,</hi> we doe not see <hi>white</hi> vsed (as a colour too remote) but rather <hi>yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> and that so farre-forth as some doe grinde a Chiue of Saffron with Vermillion, to make it the more pleasant, whereas <hi>white</hi> in like proportion

And so, admitting <hi>yellow</hi> to bee the chiefe of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall colours for the metalls sake which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth it, rightly is <hi>gules</hi> preferred before <hi>azure,</hi> in that it partakes so much of <hi>yellow.</hi> Lastly, I haue put <hi>vert</hi> before <hi>vulgar purple,</hi> for that <hi>vert</hi> is sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and indeed, a colour reputed as it were of it it selfe, and comming such to vs out of his mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls, or materialls, whereas <hi>vulgar purple</hi> is not (I presume) found in any one single substance, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther minerall, or other materiall, but is made by mixture, in like sort as <hi>Orenge-tawnie</hi> is of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine quantities of <hi>yellow</hi> and <hi>redde</hi> mixt together.

                  <p>For innumerable causes. First to maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the matter of the Elements now in hand, for if we admit such an absurdity as the subsistence of a coate, being barely a sheild of one colour (which kinde of bearing the antient Armorists called <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie,</hi> as I thinke of the clearnesse) without any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther distinction, wee vtterly make voyde the whole doctrine of Armoriall Elements, at leastwise two of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (that is to say <hi>number, &amp; position</hi>) are decar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Then, for that a coate of Armes is an artificial distinct, &amp; compounded body &amp; can no more co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist, or be of one color, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a man of one Element.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:14737:89"/>
And to be breife, for that a coate of one coulour is no coate at all, but a colour onely, or such as SCOHIER saith are <hi>Tables d' attentes,</hi> for the colour thereof beeing mettall, it is nothing but, as it were, all light, without shadow, or life without body, and beeing not metall but colour onely, it is all nothing but as it were shadow onely, and a soule-lesse body.</p>

                  <p>Examples are not prooues, and I can call to minde some particulars, wherein this rule seemes to bee infringed after seuerall manners. In the Prophesie of NAHVM, among the bookes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly scripture it is said, <hi>that the sheildes of the mighty were become redde,</hi> as some translate. In prophane authors, that of the ROMANE Poet (whom by IVS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TINIANS imperiall rule, when no name is added to signifie which of the <hi>Latin</hi> Poets wee meane, can be none but incomparable VIRGIL) is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily most memorable, where HELENOR sonne to the King of MEONIA, stolne from his friends by the seruile LICYMNIA, and sent to the warres of TROY, was
<q>—parmâ inglorius albâ.</q>
ALEXANDER <hi>Magnus</hi> also (as it is in IVSTIN) in a certaine triumphant iourney of his, bestowed Shields of white-plate (Siluer-shields) vpon his Soldiers, whom he therefore called

                     <pb n="161" facs="tcp:14737:89"/>It is farthermore in learning that AVGVSTVS CAESAR, after a victory by him obtained in the SICILIAN Sea, honoured MARCVS AGRIPPA with an <hi>azure</hi> Banner,
<q>— vexillo caeruleo.</q>
TAMORLAN the SCYTHIAN (if that bee any thing to the purpose) hung out (as some report) vpon seuerall dayes flagges of seuerall colours, Symbolicall to his designes. Wee may not in this number forget what ANDREAS RESCENDIVS is said to write, that is, that the Armes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of PORTVGALL, were nothing at first but a white flagge, till by occasion of a victory obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by King ALPHONSO, against fiue <hi>Moriseo</hi> Kings, the fiue Escucheons <hi>azure</hi> were added. The celestiall <hi>auriflamb</hi> so by the FRENCH admired, was also but of one colour, a square redde Syndon Banner. What can wee doe lesse then report the Armes of ARAGON, as they were said long since to haue beene? to wit, onely, <hi>or,</hi> that is, a <hi>field,</hi> or rather a superficies <hi>or,</hi> not charged with <hi>pallets,</hi> as they now are Blazed, which hapned at such time as one of the Kings thereof dipping his fingers in the bloud of new slaine SARACENS, or (as others say) LEVVIS Emperour in the wounds of <hi>il Conde de</hi> BARCELONA, fighting on his side against the NORMANS, ennobled that <hi>yellow</hi> standard, by drawing vpon it those bloudy markes which now it hath.

In the rere-gard, &amp; as it were last hope of the battel, appears the Example of EVMENIONS <hi>de la</hi> BRECTE, which what-soeuer it meanes, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly I deny not but that a Gentleman in exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of Armes may vpon a priuate conceit (as <hi>de la</hi> BRECTE) not only paint his Banner &amp; Sheild, but his whole Armor with <hi>Vermilion,</hi> or any other co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, leauing off his own Coate of Armes for the time, either vpon vow, singularitie, or otherwise: And of such disguizes wee haue heard, and from thence perhaps at first descended to MAC GIBBON the title, who lately was <hi>white Knight</hi> in IRELAND, &amp; is an hereditary by-name to that house of the GERALDINES, but could hee show no other, nor more significatiue note of honor, he would neuer among the learned bee registred a Gentleman of Armes.

Banner of NAVARRE all <hi>Gules,</hi> &amp; (as is written) continued such till SANCHEZ <hi>le fort,</hi> King there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, added those golden ornaments which now doe shine therein: But I can no more call the one, or the other a Coate of Armes, without extreame impropriety, and abuse of speech, then a plaine peece of Virgin-wax a seale, or a sheet of vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten paper a letter, or a maid a wife.</p>

                  <p>They are commonly called <hi>polwdred Ermin,</hi> and both the <hi>white,</hi> and <hi>black</hi> in them are skin with the haires on, for I haue seene a royall satten man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, the furre wherof was the whole cases of <hi>Ermin,</hi> their tail-tips (all that was black in them) not stitcht

in, but Pendent, and Dangling, and the Dukes of BRITAINE <hi>Armorick</hi> did giue (as I heare) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing else for their Armes: And (to vtter all my little commodities of learning, or obseruation in this kinde at once) I must tell you also that I haue heard <hi>Pellions</hi> say that there is a counterfet sort, which notwithstanding is very rich, made of the soft white bellies of Squirrel, Mineuer, and the like, drawn-in, and powldred with little specks of black ITALIAN budge. The forme of true <hi>Ermine</hi> I haue often obserued in old cloaths of ARRAS, and the like Court-hangings, and were such as these:

                  <p>The Coate of BRITAINE in FRANCE is as you say, and (as VPTON writes) taken for Armes, because (saith hee) <hi>Ermine</hi> were much found there, commending the Coate it selfe for one of the best,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:14737:95"/>
                     <figure/>
aswell for that it is of shortest Blazon (for in the word <hi>Ermin</hi> is all) is soonest made at neede, and beeing made is farthest decern'd. As cleare not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding as wee make it, all do not agree in the qualitie of the stuffe, or in this furre. For Sir IOHN FERNE (out of CASSANAEVS) saith, that they are called <hi>Hermines</hi> (aspirating the word) of <hi>Hermae,</hi> which worthily admired PLATO in his HIPPARCHVS doth say, were erected, by PISIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRATVS the sonne of PHILEDONICVS, in euery three-way-leet, and Tribe of ATHENS, and engrauen with morall verses of most excellent sense: MARSILIVS FICINVS vpon this place saith, that these <hi>Hermae</hi> were certain squared stones in manner of a statue without an head, set in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick wayes, and dedicated to MERCVRIE: But they (as some more probably report) did resemble
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:14737:96"/>
MERCVRIES head, and were of HERMES (another name of his) called <hi>Hermae,</hi> as <hi>Hermathenae</hi> had their names from the heads of MERCVRIE, and MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NERVA ioyned, as their names are ioyned in the word; ATHENE signifying the same that MINERVA, as HERMES doth MERCVRIE; and these <hi>Hermae</hi> were vsed as well in the adorning of libraries, as sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. So as in this hardy deriuation, euery spotte of <hi>Ermin</hi> in an Armes, should stand for a seuerall <hi>Herm,</hi> or shadow therof, turning thereby a painted Targat into a ROMAN <hi>Atrium,</hi> which containd the Images of Ancestors: Very pretty was that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, which my friend Maister SEGAR, GARTER, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall King of Armes, related to mee as Doctor RED-SMITHS, concerning <hi>Ermin</hi>: For (said he) see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing colours are resembled to planets, <hi>Ermin</hi> ought to bee <hi>Hermoys,</hi> of HERMES; for Quick-siluer (being so appropriated to MERCVRIE as it beares his very name) breakes into droppes, resembling <hi>Hermin</hi> in Armories: But wee that are no schollers must not (least wee should <hi>cum ratione insanire</hi>) sore so high into learning for a thing before our eyes, and palpable. GERARD LEIGH holds that the <hi>Ermin</hi> is a ltttle beast in the land of ARMONIE (so he soundes it) &amp; is from thence denominated, so <hi>Ermin</hi> should according to him be <hi>Armin</hi> of ARMENIA; certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as I cannot controule this <hi>Etymologie,</hi> so among the RVSSES, it is not the word as it seemes, for they (If I mis-vnderstand not the booke of the RVSSE common-weal) cal them <hi>Gurnstais,</hi> so <note n="*" place="margin">In our old <hi>English, Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min,</hi> signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>poor,</hi> but aske <hi>Verste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ga<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <p>You must not (Sir EVSTACE) play the Censor so soon: PYTHAGORAS would haue set a fine on your head, and made you expiate for it to his goddesse Silence. <hi>The conicctures of Maisters are to be reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced of beginners</hi>: And yet I hold your conceit not the most absurd: the word now vsed in Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is <hi>Ermin,</hi> and as I thinke of the beast it selfe so called.

                  <p>The reason belonges to the mysticall part, but I will shew it is not so capable, and giue you my rule thus: <hi>No euen number in thinges of one kind, possessing the whole field only, and alone, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:14737:101"/>
keeping all of them one state, or way, with requisite distance, can be capable of such diuersitie of formes in position, as the</hi> odde <hi>be.</hi> An euen number there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be disposed into a Crosse, or Saltoir, as the <hi>odde</hi> can, and is.
<figure/>
But if the same state, or way of placing bee not maintained, then I can demonstrate in an example or two, that the number <hi>foure,</hi> being the first, &amp; so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne of <hi>square,</hi> or <hi>cubick</hi> numbers, may be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of like formes as the <hi>Odde,</hi> as in the coat which NICHOLAS VPTON doth say was put vnto him at LONDON by an Herald of BRITAIN ARMORICK, or little BRITAIN, and which hath since I perceiue bin giuen to a familie in CHESHIRE, for borne it is as both by the painted tree of that County in THE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OBALDS, as otherwise is apparent: The Coat is very rare, and of a strange inuention, to the which wee will adde for varieties sake another called TRVB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHAVVES

                  <speaker>A.</speaker>
                  <p>It could draw small forces after, did it enter, and no barre is commonly so general, which some particular, or other will not transcend: Yet this doth not, for when you suppose it is gotten in, it is kept off with the end of the former rule, for want of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite distance.</hi> And though in the last Armes there are indeed foure of one kind, wherein the number, and quality are great, yet beeing not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierst into the Sheild, they are but in the nature of a single <hi>Lorange,</hi> or <hi>Rhombus,</hi> which figure they produce, though placed in <hi>Crosse.</hi>

                  <speaker>E.</speaker>
                  <p>I must therfore yet once againe entreat to know some litle cause of this effect, that is to say, why <hi>euen numbers are not so fairly capable of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent situations as the</hi> odde?</p>

                  <p>The reason is plain: For the midds of the Sheild must not be empty, nor yawning, and in that respect, place things of one kind in <hi>Crosse,</hi> in <hi>Saltoir,</hi> in <hi>Fesse,</hi> or after any forme, or other of the honorable ordinaries, as in <hi>Bend,</hi> in <hi>Pale,</hi> and so forth (so as you place them armorially) and assure your selfe the <hi>euen number</hi> is excluded. If you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand why the middle may not be empty, destitute or yawning? I answer, because that part being pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest, all the rest may be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rather vaca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: For the <hi>fesse-point,</hi> or <hi>millieu</hi> of the Sheild (as HIEROME BARA calls it) is the glory thereof, and dispierceth beams into euery part about, as the center, hart, or axell of all Armoriall beauties.</p>
