            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>First, The Condition upon which the promise is suspended, is faith, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that fulnesse of our hopes, that <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that solace of our lives, as <hi>Philo</hi> calleth it, nay that our life it selfe, or at least that upon which our life lies; for by it the just shall live, or by nothing, <hi>He that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in me, and he onely that beleeveth, he shall live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:17395:4"/>
And here seeing this Action is so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly specified, by its object; we may observe, That the principall obiect of our faith, is God, considered in the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of his essence and a Trinity of persons, and therefore in the Symboll of our beleife, the Creede, is there a particular <hi>Credo,</hi> or at least the particle <hi>(in)</hi> premitted apart before every one of the three persons, importing, that upon them we fixe, and build, our first assent, and assurance.</p>
            <p>As for those other subordinate prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our faith, such as concerne the Catholique Church, the Communion of Saints, these being but Creatures, are not assented unto for themselves, but for God, the uncreate, and first truth, and therefore have no such <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> nor particle set apart before them, but onely prefixed before one of the three persons.</p>
            <p>Now, this obiect of our faith is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered diversly; either, as the Act of beliefe and assent hath respect unto
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17395:4"/>
the understanding, and in that consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, the obiect of faith is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, either formall, in which respect the Act of Faith is <hi>credere Deo,</hi> we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving God as the first truth, and for him fixing a setled assent upon all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and subordinate truthes, they be the maine Characters of divinity Power, and wisdome imprinted on them, apparently manifesting, the hand, the finger of the Lord to have written them.</p>
            <p>Or else it is materiall, and so the Act of faith is <hi>credere Deum;</hi> we that beleeve beleeve that God is, and that he is a rewarder of those that seeke him.</p>
            <p>Or secondly, the obiect of faith is considered, as the Act of beleefe and assent hath respect unto the will move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the understanding to render its as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and in this respect the Act of faith is <hi>Credere in Deum,</hi> as it is here delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; for the will having pitched the end of all its hopes, in the goodnesse of this exceeding rich and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17395:5"/>
uncessantly plyeth the understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to give its assent to the truth of that which so much imports and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes its peace and satisfaction.</p>
            <p>And these different considerations, doe not importe any such various dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the Acts of faith, but rather signifie the divers respects of one and the same Act unto the obiect of faith.</p>
            <p>The summe of all may be collected thus. First, we beleeve that God is, and a rewarder of all those that seeke him: 2. We beleeve his counsells and Covenants manifested, and dispensed unto us. 3. We beleeve in him, adhaere unto him, relie on him; our Soule be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with absolute Complacencie satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in him, cryeth out, <hi>Pars mea Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> It is enough the Lord is my porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how then can I lacke any thing? we give our assent unto his counsells, and Covenants, because we are assured that in what he delivereth, or promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, he is wise and cannot be deceived himselfe, he is faithfull and will not
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17395:5"/>
deceive us; Though we discerne a propension, and flexiblenesse in our selves to waver with every contrarie Ayre, <hi>yet let God be true, though all men</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> 
               <hi>be lyars.</hi> The <hi>Aegyptians</hi> as <hi>Aquinas</hi> notes adventured to make the promise alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; I know not what feates they had, like unto those of their moderne counterfeits, to play fast, and loose with such a firme, and sealed knot as this. But whatsoever they! we, saith the Apostle, beleeve what we know, and we know whom we have belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and if we be deceived, certainely as the Prophet saith, <hi>Thou Lord hast de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ier. 20.</note> 
               <hi>us;</hi> But God for bid saith <hi>Abraham</hi> the father of all beleevers, that the Iudge of all the world, should not do righteously; And unto this well-grounded <note place="margin">Gen: 17.</note> assent, succeedes our firme adhaerence unto the covenants of promise, by which we cleave unto, and close with our Redeemer in this manner.</p>
            <p>The proposition of the promise is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17395:6"/>
furnished by the Gospell; The Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer died for those that are dead unto sin &amp; rose againe for the justification of them which are planted into the similitude of his resurrection. Now an assumption must be fitted unto the proposition by that assent which our understandings give unto the truth, and that adherence which our wills fasten upon the goodnesse of these exceeding rich and precious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. If we be able thus to limit the generall proposition, I am dead unto the world by the Crosse of Christ, or I was dead, but now I am alive in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, the conclusion will follow inevitably.</p>

            <p>It is not strange that in the first 300. years after Christ, divers even in Christ should gainesay this hope of all the world being spoyled through the same vaine Philosophy.

            <p>Our contemplation of matters of this straine which are above the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension of reason, and beyond the bounds of experience doth not arrive at knowledge but at wonder: which is nothing els but Contemplation bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, or loosing it selfe; It was aptly said by one of <hi>Platoes</hi> schoole, the sense of man resembleth the Sunne, which openeth and reveileth the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restiall Globe, but obscureth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealeth

The whole Creation which grones for the generall resurrection, practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth a yeerely, a monthly, yea a dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Resurrection in its severall parts. And all this for Man! And shall man onely not rise, for whom all these things rise in their periods and seasons? what should with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him from being restored? The powers of the grave are shaken, and disabled, Christ himselfe hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken open the Gates thereof, and loosed his Prisoners from the brinkes of the pit: death it selfe hath by his last con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict received its deaths wound: he had foiled it before, by the ministry of his servants, by <hi>Eliah</hi> recalling the <hi>Sareph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> son, by <hi>Elisha</hi> recovering the <hi>Shu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namits</hi> son. So <hi>David</hi> foiled his enemies of <hi>Ammon</hi> by the valour of his servants <hi>Ioab,</hi> and <hi>Abisha,</hi> but himselfe was faine <note place="margin">2 Sam 12.</note> to appeare before <hi>Rabbah</hi> for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of the victory and conclusion of the warre; so the Sonne of <hi>David</hi> appeared personally to give his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:17395:12"/>
Enemie the last stroke to swallow up death in an utter victory. The victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is thus atcheived. Death it selfe though he be the King of feare, and have as many Provinces of his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as there be paines, perills and snares of death, yet hath no more do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over us, then what our sinne betrayeth us unto. The arrowes of death are fledged with the feathers which grow upon our owne wings. Now therefore if we conceive man to be without sinne, death hath no more dominion over him: Death then have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing seized upon our Saviour, who was without staine or guilt, it was found equall in the Iudgement of God, that it should loose all power over us that were sinfull, because it exercised a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer which it had not over him that was innocent. For in regard of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iury offered unto him and patiently susteined by him, God adjudged him all power over him that had the power of death, giveing him liberty
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17395:12"/>
to restore unto liberty the Prisoners of the Grave.</p>
            <p>And indeed he hath reason thus to restore them, for according to that of <hi>Bernard, Christus solus resurrexit, sed non totus;</hi> Christ alone is risen, but all Christ is not risen, till all that are of, and in Christ be risen likewise. Thus though other Graves be the houses of death, this of Christ is unto us, (now the stone is removed from it) the Gate of everlasting life; Although death be the king of feare yet we see of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome there is an end, he raigned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed under the law, but now the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of righteousnesse is transferred unto one, of whose kingdome there is no end. And observe the procession and Pompe of his Triumph over his van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished foe: Death, saith the Prophet, shall goe before his face pale and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling as a Prisoner before his Trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phall chariot. He saith no longer now as he did once, <hi>O Death, I will be thy Death,</hi> It is not seasonable to threaten
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:17395:13"/>
now, death hath already felt his van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quishing armes, he spareth not now therefore to reproch him with this glorious insultation, <hi>O death where is thy Sting? O grave, where is thy victorie?</hi> Since thou didst once loose thy sting upon mine innocency, I have taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the sinnes of the world, so that now thou canst not fit thy selfe with any new sting, to wound either mee, or mine. Thus death it selfe is dead, and the dead live againe; death is swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up, and the dead are rendered up: this is the hope of humaneflesh: but he must be more then flesh, whosoever attaineth to the end of this hope, for flesh and bloud shall never inherit the <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> kingdome of heaven.</p>

Resurrection to loose you, as <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> was, from the bondes of the Grave, or to say with the father of the prodigall, loe these my sonnes were dead, but now they live: we were dead saith the Apostle, but now we are alive in Iesus Christ, now we feele the pulse of spirituall life beate in the Arteries of our faith, which assureth us that our life is prepared for us; of our hope which is resolute that it is preserved for us; of our love, which upon these well-grounded perswasions, is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually running in a cheerefull prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and chase thereof. My beloved though we have <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> dust-creeping soules: surely our hope is higher then the dust, let our conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then be as high as our hope is. Though we be made of the earth, yet we are not made for the Earth. We may observe, that he that requires the erection of our affections, doth
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17395:17"/>
with great iealousie withdraw from us all those ensnarements upon which they may fasten here below. He is such a Bridegrome, as will not that we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre the king before himselfe; this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle the world, before the compasse of his Armes. All these counterfeit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, which this empty dust is able to yeeld us, they are as of purpose, made either not to rellish at all with us, by reason of their shortnesse and flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingnesse, or to distate us by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of some calamitie and Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: for if we will be children in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding insteed of being children in Innocency, if we will still be suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king here, we must be used as <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> great babes, we must have the breast be smeared and sowred, to weane out childish longing from it.</p>
            <p>But the withdrawing of any of these earthly things from us, doth not so much withdraw us from the Earth as the calling away of those deare-ones in whose bloud, or love we have any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17395:17"/>
the wives of our youthes, the children of our delight. These are they with whom we reioyced and they being gone, the remainder of our life seemes bitter unto us, and we thinke with our selves, what further use is there of us? or what portion have we left upon the Earth? we crie like chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that have their delights and rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles taken from them. And at last as when the nurse makes the child beleev she hath layed them in the Cradle to sleepe, the childe cries to sleepe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that he may be neere them: so we when our deare ones are layed downe and composed in their beds of dust, we are weary of waking any longer, our eyes grow as heavy as our hearts, we see nothing to reioyce in, or take comfort in; we desire as <hi>Iacob,</hi> to goe downe to the grave to our sonnes, we desire to sleepe by the sides of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ones, that with them we may awake againe, after the likenesse of him who layeth us and them unto our rest,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:17395:18"/>
and shall raise us againe unto our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing.</p>
            <p>Thus should ye <hi>(Right Honorable)</hi> looke after this renowned Ladie, who is now composed unto her rest in the Bed of Earth; suspiring and longing after the same refreshing, the same hope that hope which is now no lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger hope with her but sight and sense, &amp; posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion it selfe. But if you would have your soule find the same rest with hers, let your soule seek it as she did. If with her you would find the kingdome of God seek with her the Righteousnes therof.</p>
            <p>Let us awhile looke into the Grave with which these deare ashes are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusted, for in that house <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> as the Septuagint reades that of <hi>Eccles:</hi> 13. Though the Grave be the house of death, yet we <note place="margin">Septuag.</note> shall derive from hence, an example of a gracious life, and of such a death as undoubtedly ushers in a glorious life.</p>
            <p>Anciently there were great treasures hid in the Sepulchres of great ones, &amp;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17395:18"/>
if we looke into this we shall finde a treasure too, a treasure of rich exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to us all.</p>
            <p>As she was derived of a very noble princely extraction, so she ennobled her selfe much more by endevouring to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure her selfe of her regeneration and adoption, than by her birth. That was the honor by which she va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued her selfe, and indeede the true and genuine Honor of you all, <hi>Right Honorable.</hi> He that called <hi>Abraham</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was everlastingly accursed because <note place="margin">Luke. 16.</note> God was not his father. It is a good ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation of <hi>Philo,</hi> upon that of Gen: 6. <hi>These are the Generations of</hi> Noah, Noah <hi>was a iust man and walked with God. &amp;c. Moses,</hi> saith he, setting downe <hi>Noahs</hi> Genealogie insteed of recounting his Ancestors, reckoneth his vertues. It were easie for me to name many noble names like unto these, to prove that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility by which she esteemed her selfe principally honored. She had a mind of a most excellent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>posure, of a noble &amp;
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17395:19"/>
generous height, but attempered with an admirable sweetnesse, and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, so that I may affirme, that she made use of the greatnesse of her Spirit in nothing so much, as either in the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous contempt of unworthy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries, (for some such were aymed at her though none could fasten, her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue had so Oyled her name, that no Inke would sticke upon it) or else in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient tollerating of worldly occurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and afflictions, and of them she made this happy advantage that as a thred besmeared with any filth, must be drawne through some narrow hole for the cleering of it, so the pressure of some afflictions seemed to cleere her from many corruptions, through which nature, &amp; custome, and fashion and greatnesse, do yet draw the lines of others lives.</p>
            <p>Her understanding was of great perspicacity, and as she fayled not to imploy the same for the comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of such occasions and affaires, as
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17395:19"/>
might advantage &amp; susteine the estate of her house, and procure and reinforce the content and comfort of her noble Lord: So principally she directed the strength thereof for the enabling her selfe with the knowledg of the misteries of Redemption, her delight was in the law of God, she was an unwearied reader of the Oracles of Gods sacred word, she that aimed at a living againe though she must die, sought not the tree of the knowledge of good and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, which made us all obnoxious to die, but the Tree of the knowledge of God, which is <gap reason="foreign">

I make no doubt but the State thereof hath beene much advanced, by her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and incouragement in this house, which hath beene long honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, for honouring of God. It hath

From him, and her selfe, she made a diffusion of her goodnesse to all hers, educating them in such pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, and inocency, as is admirable, in those, who (I know not how) are lya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be betraved by their Birthes and fortunes unto great depravations, and exorbitancies, so that we may say of her as <hi>Greg: Naz:</hi> said of his Sister <hi>Gorgonia,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>She made the fruite of her Bodie, to become the fruite of the spirit. And of the same goodnesse there was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable diffusion amongst those
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:17395:20"/>
that depended on her. How many that lived neere her, hath the Elixar of the same goodnesse, rendered of the same qualitie, and propertie? her charitie and Courtesie was large and open unto all. I name these as strictures of that fire of zeale, which she had to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. She was not like those which esteeme themselves onely members, and others but <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:17395:21"/>
brought death, after death it selfe. But the greatest part of her life was a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sceue, a preparation to her dissolution, as if she had beene sensible, that as Christ dyed upon the parasceue, the day of preparation; so none have any advantage by the death of Christ, but those which premit such a preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before their owne death, and disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. Is it not admirable that she who had runne through some hard les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, in the Schoole of affliction, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the rod so, for the healing, and sanctifying benefit, which she found in it, that it was her frequent prayer, that God would be pleased when he called her hence, he would be pleased to call her by a consumption, rather then by any other way. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly it was so: she conceived, that many had been shaken with the whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde of a convulsion, and perhaps the Lord God was not in that winde: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny consumed with the fire of adustion and choller, &amp; perhaps the Lord God
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17395:21"/>
was not in that fire: but whereas many have beene summoned away by the still soft voice of consumption, the Lord God is frequently in that voyce. And certainly the Lord supported her, the Lord perfected his strength in her weaknes, for she susteined that afflictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with such admirable moderation, with such strength and vigour of spirit that if any man had entred her Chamber, if he had not read the truth of her suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings in the decayes and weaknesse of her person, hee would have thought there had been none sicke there; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever she suffered, there was nothing in her mouth, but thanks to that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious hand which lay so light vpon her, and made her suffer no more.</p>
            <p>As before, so in her sicknesse especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, it was her uncessant practise, to commend her selfe continually unto God, and that in the most conceived, and feeling formes in <gap reason="foreign">

But her wordes were winged so, as to carry her spirit there where her hope was, farre above the reach of Satan, though he be plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted high too, as high as a Prince of the aire So that no marvell if her spirit du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring her last affliction, were in such a composed settlednesse, it was out of the enemies reach.
