            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Preſidentſhip of St. <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> Colledge, in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxon,</hi> being void by the death of Dr. <hi>Henry Clerk,</hi> late Preſident of the ſame, the Vice-Preſident gave notice to all the Fellows preſent in the Chappel, on <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 31 of <hi>March,</hi> 1687; where it was unanimouſly agreed, to proceed to the Election of a Preſident, on <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 13 of <hi>April</hi> following, at Nine of the Clock in the Morning, in the Chappel: And in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereto, the Vice-Preſident cauſed a Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be fix'd on the Chappel-Door of the ſaid Colledge, ſignifying the Vacancy, Time, and Place of the Election; according to the direction of the Statutes. But before the day of Election, being credibly informed, that his Majeſty had been pleaſed to grant his Letters Mandatory, in behalf of Mr. <hi>Anthony Farmer,</hi> they moſt humbly repreſented to his Sacred Majeſty, in their Petition bearing Date <hi>April</hi> 9th, That the ſaid Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi> was uncapable, by their Statutes, of being Preſident; and therefore did moſt humbly pray his Majeſty to leave them to a Free Election, or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend ſuch a Perſon to them, as was capable by their Statutes. <hi>Monday, April</hi> 11th, his Majeſty's Letters Mandatory, were delivered by the hands of Mr. <hi>Robert Chernock,</hi> Maſter of Arts, and Fellow of the ſaid Colledge, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Vice-Preſident and Fellows of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge, in <hi>Oxon,</hi> requiring them forthwith to Elect the ſaid Mr. <hi>Farmer,</hi> and admit him Preſident: Which Letter the Vice-Preſident read in the Chappel of the ſaid Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, between the hours of four and five of the Clock in the ſame day, after Evening-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, before the Fellows of the Colledge, there preſent, and asked them, Whether they in Obedience to his Majeſty's Letters, would forthwith Elect and Admit Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi> Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent? Who all agreed, in conſideration to Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi>'s not being Qualified, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Expulſion to any of the Fellows that ſhould be abſent from the Election, and that the time of Election, according to the Citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was ſo near, to defer their Anſwer till <hi>Wedneſday</hi> following: Whereupon the Vice-Preſident required all the Fellows to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the Chappel the ſaid <hi>Wedneſday</hi> Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at nine of the Clock. All the Fellows being then met, the Vice-Preſident read the Statute <hi>De Electione Preſidentis</hi>; and the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> againſt corrupt Elections, was read alſo; after which the Vice-Preſident read the King's Letter in behalf of Mr. <hi>Farmer,</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94066:5"/>
the ſecond time demanded an Anſwer of the Fellows thereto. Their Anſwer was to this effect: That having a Petition now lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Majeſty, they ought not to proceed to Election, till they had received his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Anſwer to the ſame: And thereupon they all agreed, (except Mr. <hi>Charnock)</hi> that the Election ſhould be deferred: which was accordingly done, until the next Morning nine of the Clock.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday, April</hi> 14th, at nine a Clock in the Morning, all the Fellows being met, the Vice-Preſident told them, That the Election of a Preſident had been deferred upon account of their Petition to his Majeſty, in Anſwer to which, they had not then received his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Pleaſure; that the next day was the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt time they could defer the Election by the Statutes, and therefore it was neceſſary they ſhould come to ſome Reſolution: he told them farther, That the King had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to Elect Mr. <hi>Farmer,</hi> and asked their Senſe therein: Which was unanimous (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Mr. <hi>Charnock)</hi> that the Election ſhould be deferred till the next morning eight of the Clock; and in order thereunto, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to be adminiſtred firſt; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly it was Adjourned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday, April</hi> 15th, at eight a Clock in the Morning the Vice-Preſident and Fellows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing met, Dr. <hi>Tho. Smith</hi> and Capt. <hi>Bagſhaw,</hi> two of the Fellows, acquainted the reſt, from my Lord Preſident of the Counſel, That in Anſwer to their Petition, his Majeſty having ſent his Letter to the Colledge, expected to be Obeyed. After which, the Vice-Preſident read again the King's Letter to them, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Whether in Obedience thereunto, they would Elect and Admit Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi> Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent? They anſwered, That they deſired they might proceed to an Election. Then the Vice-Preſident having propoſed, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, having received his Majeſty's Pleaſure in Anſwer to their Petition, they would make any further Addreſs? The Vice-Preſident, Dr. <hi>Fairfax,</hi> Dr. <hi>Pudſey,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Tho. Smith,</hi> were for a ſecond Addreſs; but all the reſt declared immediately for proceeding to the Election.</p>
            <p>Then the Vice-Preſident propoſed, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would go to an Election <hi>Viva voce,</hi> or by Scrutiny? The Vice-Preſident, Mr. <hi>Thompſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> were for proceeding to an Election <hi>Viva voce</hi>; all the reſt were for going to an Election by Scrutiny, except Dr. <hi>Tho. Smith,</hi> who was not for going to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, until the King ſhould again be Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
            <p>This therefore being their Senſe, That they ought to proceed to the Election of a Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent according to the Statutes, and this the laſt day limited for Election: In order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, the holy Sacrament was ſolemnly taken by all, except Mr. <hi>Charnock.</hi> Then the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute <hi>De Electione Praeſidentis,</hi> and 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt corrupt-Elections was read by the Vice-Preſident. Every one took the Oath preſcribed in the Statutes to be taken, in order to the Nomination of a Preſident, (except Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> who refuſed it): And the 2 Senior Fellows were ſworn Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators in the Scrutiny of the whole Society: For the Nomination of a Preſident, Mr. <hi>Hough</hi> and Mr. <hi>Maymard</hi> had each of them the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of all the Voices; and were accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly pronounced by the Seniour Scrutatour, <hi>Nominati in Ordine ad Electionem Praeſidentis:</hi> Then the thirteen Seniour Fellows being met to Elect one of theſe two Preſident; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them ſworn according to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; eleven of them Elected Mr. <hi>Hough,</hi> who was accordingly pronounc'd Preſident of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> Colledge, in <hi>Oxon.</hi> by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niour Scrutatour, in the preſence of all the Fellows: and Mr. <hi>Maynard</hi> was appointed by the thirteen Seniour Fellows, to preſent the ſaid Preſident Elect, to the Viſitour, in order to his Admiſſion. After this, Mr. <hi>Thompſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> declared, <hi>Viva voce</hi> for Mr. <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>; according to his Majeſty's Letter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday, April</hi> 16th, Mr. <hi>Hough,</hi> Preſident Elect, was preſented to the Viſitour by Mr. <hi>Maynard,</hi> who at the ſame time delivered to his Lordſhip an Inſtrument under the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Seal, containing the Proceedings of the Election; after a ſight whereof, Mr. <hi>Hough</hi> was Sworn and Admitted Preſident by his Lordſhip, according to the Statutes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday, April</hi> 17th, Mr. <hi>Hough</hi> at his return to the Colledge, took the ſame Oath again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Society, and afterwards, as Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, took his Seat in the Chappel, at four a Clock Prayers in the Afternoon.</p>

            <p>UPon the Notice of the Death of Dr. <hi>Henry Clark,</hi> Late Preſident of St. <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxon</hi>; the Vice-Preſident called a Meeting of the Fellows, in order to appoint a day for the Election of a new Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. The 13th of <hi>April</hi> was the day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd; with power to prorogue the Election to the 15th, as they ſhould ſee cauſe, beyond which time it was not in their power to defer the ſame. This being agreed, a Citation, or Praemonition was fix'd upon the Chappel-door of the Colledge, ſignifying the ſame; and ſummoning all the abſent Fellows to repair home to the enſuing Election, as the Statute in that caſe directs. After this, upon the 11th of <hi>April,</hi> they receiv'd His Majeſty's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in behalf of Mr. <hi>Farmer,</hi> requiring them to elect and admit him Preſident: But he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never been Fellow of that Colledge, nor <hi>New</hi>-Colledge, in which are the only Perſons capable of being choſen by the Statutes; and wanting likewiſe ſuch perſonal Qualifications as are required in the Character of a Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, they did not imagine it was, or could be His Majeſty's Pleaſure, that they ſhould act ſo directly contrary to the expreſs Words of their Statutes, to which they are ſtrictly and poſitively ſworn: But did humbly conceive they were bound in Duty to believe, that His Majeſty had been miſ-informed in the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter and Capacity of Mr. <hi>Farmer.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on the 15th of <hi>April,</hi> the laſt of thoſe days within which they were confin'd to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Election, they proceeded to a choice, and having firſt received the Bleſſed Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, and taken an Oath as the Founder en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns, to chooſe a Perſon ſo qualified, as is there ſpecified; they did elect the Reverend Mr. <hi>John Hough,</hi> Batchellor in Divinity, who is a Perſon every way qualified by the Satutes of the ſaid Colledge: And if it ſhall be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that His Majeſty did in His Letter for Mr. <hi>Farmer,</hi> graciouſly diſpenſe with all the Statutes that rendered him uncapable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elected; and that therefore they might have obeyed without breach of their Oaths: They humbly beg leave to repreſent, that there is an expreſs Clauſe in that Oath, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man takes when he is admitted Fellow of the Colledge; wherein he ſwears not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, accept, or make uſe of any Diſpenſation from his Oath, or any part thereof, by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever

procured, or by what Authority ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver granted. As to their former practice when they have elected in obedience to the King's Letter heretofore; it has been always in ſuch caſes where the perſons recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have been every way qualified for the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by their Statutes; in which caſes they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have been; and ever will be, ready to comply with His Majeſty's pleaſure; it not being without unſpeakable regret, that they diſobey the leaſt of His Commands. They know how intirely their welfare depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Countenance of their Prince; nor doth any thing more deeply affect and grieve their Souls, then when they find themſelves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to this unfortunate neceſſity, of either diſobeying his Will, or violating their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences by notorious Perjuries.</p>

And at the time of Election of a Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the ſaid Fellows are bound by the ſaid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, to take an Oath that they ſhall nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate none to that Office, but ſuch as are, or have been Fellows of the ſaid Colledge, or of <hi>New-Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxon:</hi> or if they are not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94066:7"/>
Fellows at that time of Election; that they be ſuch as have left their Fellowſhips in their reſpective Colledges upon credible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. And when two qualified perſons ſhall be nominated at the time of Election, by the greater number of all the Fellows, to the ſaid Office of Preſident; the thirteen Seniors alſo ſwear that they will Elect one of them, whom in their Conſciences they think moſt proper and ſufficient, moſt diſcreet, moſt uſeful, and beſt qualified for the Place; without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to love, hatred, favour, or fear. And every Fellow when he is firſt admitted into his Fellowſhip in the ſaid Colledge, ſwears that he will inviolably keep and obſerve all the Statutes and Ordinances of the Colledge, and every thing therein contained, ſo far as does or may concern him, according to the plain, literal, and grammatical ſenſe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, and as much as in him lies will cauſe the ſame to be kept and obſerved by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and that he will not procure any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation contrary to his aforeſaid Oath, or any part thereof, nor contrary to the Statutes and Ordinances to which it relates, or any of them; nor will he endeavour that ſuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation ſhall be procured by any other, or others, publickly or privately, directly or indirectly. And if it ſhall happen that any Diſpenſation of this ſort, of whatſoever Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority it ſhall be, whether in general or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, or under what form of Words ſoever it be granted, that he will neither make uſe of it, nor in any ſort conſent thereunto. That upon Notice of the Death of Dr. <hi>Clark</hi> Late Preſident of the ſaid Colledge, the Vice-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident called a Meeting of the ſaid Fellows, in order to the appointing a day for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of a new Preſident, and the 13th of <hi>April</hi> was the time prefix'd, with power to prorogue the ſame as they ſhould ſee cauſe, till the 15th, beyond which time they could not ſtatutably defer their Election, and in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof a Citation, or Premonition, was fix'd upon the Chappel-door of the ſaid Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſignifying the ſame, and by which the abſent Fellows were Summoned to repair home, as the Statute in the Caſe requires. And the ſaid Vice-Preſident, and other deputed Fellows farther ſay, that on the 11th of <hi>April</hi> aforeſaid, they received His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Letters Mandatory, to Elect and Admit the ſaid Mr. <hi>Anthony Farmer</hi> Preſident of the ſaid Colledge: But foraſmuch as the ſaid Vice-Preſident, and Fellows, apprehended the right of Election to be in them, and believed His Majeſty never intended to diſpoſſeſs them of their Rights: And foraſmuch as the ſaid Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi> had never been Fellow either of <hi>Magdalen,</hi> or <hi>New</hi>-Colledge in <hi>Oxon,</hi> and had not thoſe Qualifications which in, and by, the ſaid Statutes of the Colledge are required in the Character of a Preſident, as they in their Conſciences did, or do verily believe; and in regard that they could not comply with His Majeſty's Letter, without the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of their Oaths, and hazard of their le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Intereſt and Property, wherewith they are by their Statutes poſſeſſed, and which by their Oaths they are bound to maintain, they repreſented the ſame by their humble Petition to His Majeſty. And having deferred their Election of a Preſident to the laſt day limited by their Statutes, then they proceeded to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and having firſt received the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, and taken the ſaid Oaths, as the Statutes enjoyn, to chooſe a Perſon ſo qualified as is before expreſſed, they did Elect the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Mr. <hi>John Hough</hi> B. D. and one of the Fellows of their Colledge, a Perſon every way qualified to be Preſident, who has been ſince confirmed by the Biſhop of <hi>Winton</hi> their Viſitor, as the Statutes of the ſaid Colledge direct.</p>
            <p>And that they might not lye under His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Diſpleaſure by their Proceedings, they did on the 19th of <hi>April</hi> make an humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation thereof to His Majeſty, by his Grace the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Chancellor of the Univerſity of <hi>Oxon,</hi> ſetting forth their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable obligations to obſerve their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Statutes.</p>
            <p>All which Matters the Vice-Preſident, and other deputed Fellows, do humbly offer to your Lordſhips, and pray to be diſmiſſed with your Lordſhips favour.</p>

            <p>That having left <hi>Cambridge,</hi> he taught School at <hi>Chippenham</hi> in <hi>Wiltſhire,</hi> under a Nonconformiſt Miniſter, without Licenſe.</p>
            <p>That in <hi>September</hi> 1683. the ſaid Mr. <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> was entred in St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> Hall in <hi>Oxon.</hi> where ſuch frequent Complaints were brought againſt him to the Principal, for his troubleſome humour and unquiet temper, that to preſerve the Peace of the Society, he was deſired to leave the ſaid Hall.</p>
            <p>That after his leaving <hi>Magdalen</hi> Hall, he was admitted into <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge, where diſcourſing about Religion, he declared, That there was no Proteſtant but would cut the Kings Throat: notwithſtanding which, at other times he declared to ſome of the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of the ſaid Colledge, That whatſoever he pretended, he was really a Member of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; and that he made an Intereſt with ſome Roman Catholicks, only to get Preferment by their means, and for that reaſon was willing to be thought of their Religion.</p>
            <p>That at the very time when his Majeſty's Letter came to the Colledge in his behalf, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi> was at <hi>Abbington</hi> in very ill Company, where he continued drinking to exceſs two or three days and nights together; and amongſt other Diſorders, was one of thoſe that then in the night time threw the Town-Stocks into the River: and that in general the ſaid Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi> hath had the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs to lie under an ill Fame, as to his Life and Converſation, as by ſeveral Letters and Certificates, ready to be produced, will more largely appear.</p>

It is an unexpreſſible Affliction to us, to find our ſelves reduced to ſuch an extremity, that either we muſt diſobey Your Majeſty's Royal Command, contrary to our own Inclinations, and that conſtant courſe of Loyalty which we have ſhew'd in all inſtances hitherto upon all occaſions whatſoever; or elſe break our Founder's Statutes, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately perjure our ſelves.</p>
            <p>For our Founder hath obliged us under Oath, when we came in Fellows, inviolably to obſerve his Statutes, and one Clauſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in injoyns us never to admit, or make uſe of Diſpenſation granted by any Authority what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, whereby we may be abſolved from the ſame. In this Statute for the Election of a Preſident, he commands us upon Oath to Elect ſuch a Perſon into the place of Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, within 15 days after the vacancy, who either is, or has been Fellow of our own, or <hi>New</hi>-Colledge: Which we repreſented to Your Majeſty in our humble Petition, ſign'd <hi>April</hi> 9th, wherein we offered our ſelves rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to Elect any Perſon capable of the ſame, who Your Majeſty ſhould be pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend, and having waited the utmoſt time limited by our Statutes, and receiv'd no Anſwer to that effect, we did then accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the exigence of our Statutes (having firſt taken the Holy Euchariſt, and our ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Oaths to that purpoſe) nominate and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ſuch a Perſon, as we in our Conſciences did believe to be every way qualified for that Place: By which Act of ours, we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed all that right to him, which our Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hath intruſted us with; and it does not lie in our power to admit any other. Our Founder in another Statute obligeth us under the pain of Perjury, a dreadful Anathema, and eternal Damnation, not to ſuffer any of his Statutes to be altered, infringed, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſed with, and commands us under the ſame Sacred Obligations, not to execute any Orders or Decree whatſoever, contrary or repugnant to the ſaid Statutes; by which ſaid Statutes, and Oaths, we are utterly incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to admit the ſaid Reverend Father in God to be our Preſident.</p>
            <p>May it pleaſe Your Sacred Majeſty, to give us leave to lay this our Caſe, and our ſelves, withal ſubmiſſion, at Your Royal Feet, moſt earneſtly beſeeching Your Sacred Majeſty, to extend to us Your humble Petitioners, that

            <p>UPon an inquiry made of your preſent Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd that you are a perſon eminent in that Learned Body, for your Temper, Prudence, and good Conduct in Affairs; and therefore very fit to be addreſs'd to by me, who do not ſend you this to trapan you, and your Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; but out of a paſſionate concern for your intereſt, to perſwade you, either to a compliance with His Majeſty's Letters Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; or to think among your ſelves of ſome expedient to prevent the ruin of your Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and your ſelves: And to offer it to His Majeſty's Royal Conſideration, that the Order for the <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> againſt the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge may be recall'd, before it be too late; for you cannot be ſenſible how highly His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty is incens'd againſt you, neither can you give one inſtance whether ever that ſort of proceeding was judged againſt the Crown. Your Cauſe moſt think it very hard; but you are not in Prudence to relye on the goodneſs of your Cauſe; but to do what the preſent inſtant of Affairs will permit, and in patience to expect a Seaſon that will be more auſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to Perſons of your Character.

            <p>Where there are ſo many Statutes to be obſerved, 'tis impoſſible but ſome muſt be broken at one time or another; and I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Learned of the Law, that a failure in any one point, forfeits your Grant, and lays your Colledge open to the Royal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſal.</p>
            <p>I could give many other prudent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that might poſſibly incline you to a ſpeedy endeavour of putting an end to your Troubles, almoſt, at any rate; but I ſhall ſuggeſt this one thing to you, that your fatal overthrow would be a fair beginning of ſo much aimed at Reformation, firſt of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, then of the Church, and adminiſter ſuch an opportunity to the Enemy, as may not perhaps occur in His Majeſty's Reign.

            <head>The Anſwer to the aforementioned written Letter, Dated <hi>Oct. 3</hi>d. <hi>1687.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE incloſed Paper is a Copy of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which by the charitable purpoſe of it, ſeems to be writ by you, who have been already ſo kind as to appear on our behalf, and are reported by all that know you, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy much of your time in doing good to Mankind, and uſing your Credit with His Majeſty, to undeceive him in any wrong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions given him of his conſcientious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and where his Juſtice and Goodneſs have been thereby abuſed, to reconcile the Perſons injur'd to His Majeſty's Favour, and ſecure them by it from Oppreſſion and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. In this confidence, I preſume to make this application to you, deſiring your excuſe for not ſubſcribing it: For if you did write the Letter, you know to whom it was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and if you did not, I hope your Charity will induce you to make ſuch uſe of your light you have by it, into the Affairs of our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as to mediate for us with His Majeſty, to be reſtored to his good opinion, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing which is deſired by us, who are zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, above all earthly things, for his Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Glory.</p>
            <p>We are not conſcious of ever giving His Majeſty any juſt Offence, as it will appear with you, when you ſhall have peruſed the encloſed Papers; and have therefore no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fear the iſſuing out of a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> againſt us. And though you are pleaſed to apprehend it, no inſtance can be given of a Judgment againſt the Crown, upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of that Writ: The Learned in the Law tell me, there is nothing more common, and whereof many Caſes are reported by <hi>Kellaway,</hi> from Page 128, to Page 152, of his Book of Reports: And I think I have heard of a Caſe in <hi>Coke</hi>'s ninth Report of the Abbeſs of <hi>Prata Marcella,</hi> which evinces the ſame; wherein alſo there is a recital of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given againſt <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> for the King, upon a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> in Court of <hi>Eyre,</hi> revers'd for Errour in the King's-Bench. We hope though we have many Statutes, it will be found that we have not wilfully tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs'd any of them, for all our preſent Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are derived to us from our adherence to them, and our fear to offend God, and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh our Conſciences, by departing from them.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty is intentionally righteous and juſt in all his Proceedings, He will never knowingly invade any Man's Property, as He was ſolemnly pleaſed to declare in his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Speech made in Council, on the 6th of <hi>February,</hi> 1684, at his Acceſſion to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; which is again repeated in His gracious Declaration for Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, of the 4th of <hi>April</hi> laſt paſt. It is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on His Sacred inviolable, and Royal Word and Promiſe, we muſt depend; not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but when His Majeſty ſhall be rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of our Caſe, in reference to both His Mandatory Letters to our Colledge, His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger towards us will be totally extinguiſhed.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94066:14"/>
Our compliance to the firſt (which was Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi>'s Election) would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd us in the guilt of manifeſt Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the wilful violation of our Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes: And we are confident his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty would never have granted the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond on the behalf of my Lord Biſhop of <hi>Oxon,</hi> if he had known we were then poſſeſs'd of a Preſident duly Elected ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Statutes, and confirmed by the Biſhop of <hi>Winton,</hi> our Viſitor (as the Statutes require); and if he is thereby inveſted with a Lay-Freehold under the protection of his Majeſties Laws, which we cannot undo or attempt to invade, without ſubjecting our ſelves to Suits at Law, and doing an apparent injury to the Preſident, who doth not conceive himſelf to be affected with the Sentence of the Lords Commiſſionets, (to which he was no Party) whereby his Place is declared void, without any Citations, Summons, or hearing of him.</p>
            <p>I believe no inſtance can be given of a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> brought againſt a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or Hall in the Univerſities, from the firſt foundation of them to this day, or any other Eccleſiaſtical Corporation: for the Abuſes of ſome Conſtitutions or Franchiſes in them, and the Miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of particular Perſons, will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy a Colledge: And if the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Colledge ſhould be diſſolv'd, the Revenues thereof will return to the Founders Heirs, and not divolve to the Crown. And if our Colledge muſt be the firſt Example of that kind, we ſhall be better juſtified by the ſtrict Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our Statutes, (at leaſt to God and our own Conſciences) than we could have been by a voluntary and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate Breach of them.</p>
            <p>It was Loyalty and Conſcience, that in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, made thirty four of our forty Fellows, and moſt of the Scholars of our Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rather quit their Places, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Miſery and Ruine, than to ſubmit to the Government of the Uſurpers of the Crown. And in <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, the ſame Inducements prevailed on us to raiſe a Company at our own charges, under the command of one of our Fellows, to engage againſt him. And we hope that theſe and many other the like inſtances, which may be given of the Loyalty and Zeal of our Society to the Royal Family, will be received as Evidences thereof, and that our good and gracious Soveraign will not exclude us from that Liberty of Conſcience, which he was pleas'd to extend to all his Subjects.</p>

            <head>Some <hi>QUERIES</hi> ſent to the Fellows of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge from <hi>Windſor, September 15. 1687.</hi>

               <hi>Firſt,</hi> WHether, waving your Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>of the Biſhop of Oxon,</hi> you cannot, without violence to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, ſignifie to his Majeſty, or the above Reverend Biſhop, your willingneſs to admit the Lord Biſhop Preſident of your Colledge?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether it be not more Intereſt to the Proteſtant Religion, to have a ſuſpected Popiſh Preſident, than to have all the places of the Colledge refilled by the Kings ſole Authority with Popiſh Novices and Prieſts?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Whether you are not under a miſtake, in thinking you ſhould ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your ſelves more acceptable to the Proteſtant Nobility and Gentry, by your being turned out of your Fellowſhips by Injuſtice and Violence, as you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; or rather will not they be very cautious how they receive you into their Families, for fear of giving of Offence?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Whether his Majeſty, as Supream Viſitor of the Univerſity, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not place or diſplace there <hi>ad libitum</hi>; or whether you have a right notion of the Proceedings which have been pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed againſt you? Whether you ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the Lords Commiſſioners pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded againſt you as Lords Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or Viſitors? Which Notion, I am ſure, will overthrow ſome bodies Plea and Exception againſt their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Whether you acted like men skilled in buſineſs, when you refuſed Mr. <hi>Pen</hi>'s Mediation, who you may be ſure had good Authority for what he did? You could not but know that man, and therefore muſt needs be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed againſt any Wiles that could be offered to you. Whether an unanimous Subſcription for an Expedient, (which indeed I think you ought not to refuſe in good manners, ſince the King was pleaſed to propoſe it) preſented to his Majeſty by Mr. <hi>Pen,</hi> or another Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, would prevent the deſtruction of the beſt Foundation in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

            <head>An Anſwer to ſeveral Queries to the Vice Preſident and Fellows of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxon,</hi> ſent from <hi>Windſor,</hi> dated the <hi>25</hi>th of September, <hi>1687.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>To the Firſt.</hi> WE cannot, without vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence to our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and deliberate Perjury, admit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſon to be Preſident of our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that is not elected thereunto, and qualified according to our Statutes; whereby the Biſhop of <hi>Oxon</hi> is in no ſort capable; nor is there any Memorial in all our Regiſter of any admiſſion of a Preſident without Election, but of one Dr. <hi>Nicholas Bond,</hi> whoſe caſe was as followeth, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Upon the death of Dr. <hi>Lawrence Humphreys,</hi> about the 30th or 32th of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, the Queen recommended Dr. <hi>Bond</hi> (being a Fellow of our Colledge) to be Elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94066:15"/>
Preſident. Many of the Fellows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd in their judgment to Elect one <hi>Smith</hi> (another of the Fellows) and at their meeting for Election, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was ſo great, that they roſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Electing, and the Obſtinacy conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till the place became laps'd: And there being no proviſion in our Statutes to direct us what to do in ſuch a Caſe, the Queen, by her Letters Patents, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the ſaid Dr. <hi>Bond</hi> to be Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent; and therein declared, That her Majeſty being inform'd that the Fellows had neglected to make Election of a Preſident in due time, (as their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes required) and thoſe Statutes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving made no proviſion for ſuch an O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, She, out of her Princely care for the place, and indulgence for thoſe perſons who had been guilty of that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, did by advice of the Biſhop of <hi>Winton,</hi> their Viſitor, Conſtitute Dr. <hi>Bond</hi> their Preſident; with proteſtation nevertheleſs, that She did not thereby pretend to ſuperſede their Statutes, or invade their Right of Election, which was thereby inveſted in them, but took this courſe as the only means left to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their Defect of Election.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the Second.</hi> We muſt not make our ſelves guilty of deliberate Perjury, for any conſiderations whatſoever, both in reſpect to our Conſciences, and that we may not by ſuch a Breach upon our Statutes, expoſe our Conſtitution to a Forfeiture, nor do Evil that Good may come on it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the Third.</hi> We conceive we ſhall be more acceptable to all good men, for acting honeſtly according to our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, than for voluntarily and unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly departing from our Right.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the Fourth.</hi> We pretend not to make it a Queſtion, whether his Majeſty, by his Authority Royal as Supream Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitor, can grant a Commiſſion for Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of any Colledge that has a Local Viſitor by their Statutes, and are not Royal Foundations: But we are adviſed, that no Commiſſion can be granted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Great Seal to Viſitors, to place and diſ-place Members of Colledges (whoſe places are Freeholds) <hi>ad libi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> or <hi>diſcretum</hi>; but they muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to legal diſcretion, that is, by the Laws and Statutes of the Land, and the Local Statutes of the Colledge. And places concern'd for the Headſhips and Fellowſhips of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, are Temporal Poſſeſſions, and cannot be impeach'd by Summary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. One Dr. <hi>Thomas Loveney</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of our Colledge, was deprived in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, by the Biſhop of <hi>Winton,</hi> the Legal Viſitor thereof Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd by Royal Authority, and he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd to the Queen; but by the advice of all the Judges, it was held, that the Queen by her Authority, as Supream Viſitor, could not meddle in it, but he muſt bring <gap reason="blank" extent="1 span">

The King has a great Authority Spiritual as well as Temporal; but no Commiſſioners can be authorized by the Crown to proceed in any Commiſſion under the Great Seal or otherwiſe, but according to Law; in Spiritual Cauſes by the Canon Law, in Temporal by the other Laws and Statutes of the Land.

            <head>AN Account of the VISITATION OF St <hi>Mary Magdalen Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxon.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ON <hi>Oct.</hi> 19th, Mr. <hi>Atterbury</hi> the King's Meſſenger, fix'd a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on the Colledge and Chappel-Doors, requiring the Pretended Preſident and Fellows, and other Members of the Colledge to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Lords Commiſſioners, Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Wright,</hi> and Mr. Barron <hi>Jenner,</hi> in the Chappel, at Nine of the Clock on <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>-morning, <hi>November</hi> 21ſt.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> the Lords Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners came to <hi>Oxon,</hi> attended with three Troops of Horſe which Quarter there.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Friday</hi>- Morning at Nine they went into the Chappel; the Preſident and Fellows thinking they had deſign'd to fit in the Quire, made no preparation of Seats in the outward Chappel; upon which their Lordſhips adjourned to the Hall, where their Commiſſion was then read, which in general was the ſame with the former: Theſe three being added to the other Lords Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and particularly impowred to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge only.</p>
            <p>This done, the Names of the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Fellows were called over, Dr. <hi>Hough</hi> being firſt called. All in Town appeared, (except Dr. <hi>Fairfax</hi>) and excuſes were made for the abſent.</p>
            <p>Then a Speech was made by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> and in it his Lordſhip was Severe againſt Diſloyalty and Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. He urg'd that the Church of <hi>England</hi> taught an unconditionate and unlimited Obedience; He ſpake of the Kings Gracious Promiſes to Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which had deſerved thanks on bended Knees, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Oxon</hi> Reaſons to the contrary which they knew beſt who was the Authour thereof. He told them that it could not be expected, but that the King would give all incouragement to thoſe of his own Religion, which could be done without ſeverity and cruelty which His Majeſty abhorr'd, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injuring the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which was at preſent eſtabliſh'd by Law: He told them that this Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as well as others were the Creatures of the Crown; and that it was inſolence in their Local Statutes to ſpurn againſt their Maker.</p>
            <p>That their Diſtempers had brought this Viſitation upon them, the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of which might be ill to the Church and Univerſities: That however they might eſcape in this World, theſe Sins were to be accounted for above their other Sins in the next. He Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them by the Bowels of Chriſt to conſider theſe things: He told them, that the Eyes of the World were upon them, and they ought to take care that their Practices might not influence their deluded admirers. In ſhort, the whole deſign of the Speech ſeem'd to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and threats, to aime at the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them to a complyance.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, I do declare here in the name of my ſelf, and the greater part of the Fellows; that we ſubmit to the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as far as it is conſiſtent with the Laws of the Land, and the Statutes of the Colledge, and no further. I deſire your Lordſhips that it may be Recorded.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>
                  <hi>This was twice Repeated.</hi>

                  <p>You cannot imagine that we Act contrary to the Laws of the Land, and as to the Statutes the King has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with them: Do you think we come here to act againſt Laws.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                  <p>It does not become me (my Lords) to ſay ſo, but I'le be plain with your Lordſhips; I find that your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion gives you Authority to change and alter the Statutes, and make new ones as you think fit: Now my Lords we have an Oath, not only to obſerve theſe Statutes (laying his hand on the Book) but to admit of no new ones, or alterations in theſe; This muſt be my behaviour here, I muſt admit of no alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from it, and by the Grace of God never will.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, the matter of this Oath is unlawful; and in ſuch a caſe, no man is oblig'd to obſerve an Oath: Beſides, the Statute is taken away by the Laws of the Land.</p>

                  <p>I do not ſay, but that his Majeſty may alter our Statutes, nor do I know but a Parliament may do the ſame; I diſpute not their Power: onely this, my Lord, I ſay, that I who already have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken an Oath to obſerve theſe Statutes as they now ſtand, and am ſworn not to admit of any change or alteration by any Authority whatſoever, [<hi>And then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Oath where they were to obſerve theſe Statutes and no other, according to the Literal and Grammatical ſence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and reading it to their Lordſhips.</hi>] can

obey none: But then thoſe who come after ſuch Limitations and Reſtrictions are made, are not oblig'd to obſerve 'em; and that, my Lords, is our Caſe, as to the Statutes of the Maſs.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Then the Decree of the 22d of <hi>June</hi> was read, declaring the Preſident's Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction Null and Void.</p>

                  <p>Yes, my Lord, I have heard of it.</p>

                  <p>I was never Cited before their Lordſhips, nor was either heard by them in Perſon or Proxy; and I think I am the onely inſtance that is extant, of any man that was ever depriv'd of a Free-hold, wherein he was legally inveſted, and of which he was quietly poſſeſs'd, without being Summon'd or Heard.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, He is abſent, and if your Lordſhips give me leave, I have ſomewhat to ſay on his account; your Lordſhips may pleaſe to obſerve in that Decree, that the reaſon given, why Dr. <hi>Fairfax</hi> was Suſpended from his Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, was, becauſe he had not obeyed his Majeſty's Command, in not Electing Mr. <hi>Anthony Farmer</hi> Preſident of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: Now the Charge of Immorality given in againſt Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi> by the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; Delegates was made out, and their Lordſhips fully ſatisfied in it, on the 29th of <hi>July</hi>

                  <p>My Lord, the Statutes onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that he ſhould be Doctor of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Phyſick, Law, or Maſter of Arts: There is indeed one Statute which ſays, The Preſident or Seniour Fellow ſhould Read Prayers upon ſuch certain Days; from whence we conclude, that the Founder ſuppos'd we might have a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident that might not be in Orders; and in ſuch a caſe he takes care that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niour Fellow ſhould do his Duty.</p>

               <p>Then a Petition was read from the Society to his Majeſty, ſigned the 9th of <hi>April,</hi> and preſented the 10th to the Earl of <hi>Sunderland,</hi> by the hands of Dr. <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> and Captain <hi>Bagſhaw,</hi> wherein 'twas ſet forth, that having heard that his Majeſty would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend

Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi> to them a perſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable; they did humbly beſeech him either to leave them to a free Election, or to recommend a qualified perſon.</p>

                  <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lord, We did till the very laſt day wherein we are limited to finiſh the Election; and my Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi> returned, in the King's name, this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That his Majeſty expected to be obeyed. Now, my Lord, we did no longer defer the Election, becauſe our Statutes enjoyn us within ſuch a time, and we ſtaid to the utmoſt. Nor could we chuſe the perſon his Majeſty did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend, knowing him to be ſo unfit, as we afterward made him appear to be. The Society was therefore to proceed to the Election of another perſon, and did agree on ſuch as you ſee.</p>

                  <p>My Lord, Whilſt the perſon his Majeſty recommends appears duly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the place, it ſeems indeed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that we ſhould not proceed to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of another; but when he is known to be utterly uncapable, it ſeems to be the ſame as if there were no Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at all.</p>

                  <p>There neither is nor can be a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident ſo long as I live, and obey the Statutes of the Colledge; and therefore I do not think fit to give up my Right, the Keys and Lodgings.</p>

                  <p>My Lords, we never deliver up the Keys to the Biſhop of <hi>Winton</hi>; and we own no greater Viſitatorial Power than his, he hath the King's Authority. 'Tis by Verttue of a Royal Charter that we live together, and enjoy the benefit of this Place, that impower'd our Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to give us a Rule, and obliged us by Oath to act ſuitable unto it: and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Winton</hi> is hereby conſtituted to be our Viſitor; and all this we own from the King's Authority. The Biſhop of <hi>Winton</hi> is our ordinary Viſitor; the King (I preſume) our extraordinary. But your Lordſhips know it hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſed, Whether the King can viſit a private Colledge or not? The Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Preſident is made by delivering up the Statute-Book, and Keys; and therefore I look upon them as an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Badge of my Office.</p>
                  <p>But I humbly beg that I may ask your Lordſhips one Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>Your Lordſhip is pleaſed to demand of me to give up theſe things: Does your Lordſhip own my Right? For if not, which is it your Lordſhips would have me give up?</p>

                  <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                  <p>If I am an Intruder, the Biſhop of <hi>Winton</hi> made me one, and I thank God for it. My Lords, the time we have been allowed for this appearance, has been very ſhort, but one day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt it and the Citation: We are men ignorant in the Laws, and I muſt confeſs it of my ſelf in particular, that I have endeavoured to give your Lordſhips a plain and ſatisfactory Reply to ſuch Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions as your Lordſhips have been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to put to me. It is very probable that through ignorance and inadverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy I may expreſs my ſelf unwarily: If ſo I beſeech your Lordſhip let no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage be taken of it, my intention has been always to expreſs my ſelf with all imaginable Duty to the King, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to your Lordſhips. If I have done otherwiſe, I beſeech your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips Candor in a favourable Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what I ſaid, that nothing may be taken amiſs, where all was dutifully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. And now my Lords, thus far have I appear'd before you as Judges; I now addreſs to you as Men of Honour, and Gentlemen, I beſeech you to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent me as dutiful to His Majeſty to the laſt Degree, as I always will be, ſo far as my Conſcience permits me, to the laſt moment of my Life; and when I am diſpoſſeſt here, I hope your Lordſhips will interceed, that I may no longer lie under His Majeſty's Diſpleaſure, or be frown'd upon by my Prince, which is the greateſt Affliction can befall me.</p>

               </p>

                  <p>ON <hi>Friday</hi> laſt, in the afternoon, you ſeem'd to inſiſt very much on this, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That his Majeſty in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Fellows of the ſaid Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to Elect Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi> Preſident, did thereby inhibit them to Elect any other Perſon whatſoever; which has not yet been made appear to be Law, either out of the Books of Civil, Canon, or Common Law. Neither is it agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Reaſon, that a Command to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect a Perſon uncapable, ſhould include in it an Obligation not to Elect a Perſon capable, that being a kind of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction <hi>in ternimis.</hi> Yet this being granted, it cannot in the leaſt affect the ſaid Fellows, or invalidate their Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Dr. <hi>Hough,</hi> notwithſtanding his Majeſties <hi>Mandate</hi> in behalf of Mr. <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> who being incapable of the place, the Fellows cannot be ſaid to be guilty of any Diſobedience or Diſloyalty, in proceeding to the Election of another Perſon who was quallified according to Statute, being forced to make an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For they are oblig'd by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of their Colledge, (when call'd together) to Elect a Preſident, or any Officer under pain of perpetual Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Colledge, to meet and make an Election; which puniſhment they incur <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> who either refuſe to meet when ſo call'd, or being met, to nominate or elect a perſon into the Office void, as appears by the Statutes of the ſaid Colledge: <hi>Titulo de nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro Scholdrium &amp; electione Praeſidentis.</hi> Now, according to the Founders dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the ſaid Statute, on the 15th of <hi>April</hi> laſt, the Fellows were call'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the Vice-Preſident to Elect a Preſident in the place of Dr. <hi>Clark</hi> deceas'd, and the Oath deſired to be taken before the Election was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred by the Vice-Preſident to them, whereby they are oblig'd to nominate and elect a perſon that either is or has been Fellow of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge or <hi>New</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxon</hi>; which Oath when the Fellows had taken, it was not in their power to elect Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi>; and yet they were then oblig'd to make an Election under pain of perpetual a motion from the Colledge, as appears by the forecited Statute. And it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imagin'd that his moſt Sacred Majeſty did expect that the Fellows ſhould be either perjur'd, or forfeit their Right to their Fellowſhips, rather than diſobey his Command; his Majeſty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving moſt graciouſly declar'd, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience ought not to be forced, and that none of his Subjects ſhould be moleſted in the enjoyment of their Rights and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:94066:20"/>
Priviledges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now that our Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings at the Election cannot lay any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of our Diſobedience or Diſloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty upon us, will thus be made appear: Either we had the power to Elect a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, or we had not; if we had not, to what end or purpoſe did his Majeſty command us to elect one? if we had, our power was either reſtrain'd to Perſons ſo and ſo quallified, or we were at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to chuſe whom we pleas'd; but we could not do the latter, as appears by our Statutes: and therefore we could not elect Mr. <hi>Farmer,</hi> being not inveſted with any power to elect a Perſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quallified. And if we had ſo done, our Election would have been null and void in it ſelf, and the Perſon elected liable to be turn'd out by our Viſitor.</p>
                  <p>As for the Decree of his Majeſty's Commiſſioners (in purſuance of which your Lordſhips have admoniſh'd Doctor <hi>Hough</hi> to receed from the place of Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and quietly to reſign the Keys of his Office, and have ſtruck his Name out of the Colledge-Book) we humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to be null and void in it ſelf, to all intents and purpoſes, Dr. <hi>Hough</hi> being thereby depriv'd of Freehold for life, (of which he was duly and legally poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt) without ever being call'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Right, or any Miſdemeanour ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt him. Wherefore we humbly beg leave of your Lordſhips, that Dr. <hi>Hough</hi> may be permitted to defend his Right and Title to the Preſidentſhip at Common Law, before any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is put in poſſeſſion of the place.</p>

            <p>After this Mr. <hi>Wiggins,</hi> Chaplain to the Biſhop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> was called in, who delivered a Paper impowering him as Proxy, to be Inſtalled Preſident for his Lord; which being read, together with the King's Mandate for the Biſhop of <hi>Oxon</hi>; which Letters is as follows. The queſtion was put to two or three of the Seniours, Whether they would aſſiſt at this Inſtalment? which they refuſing, the Court Adjourned to the Chappel, where the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi> put Mr. <hi>Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins</hi> into the Preſident's Stall, where he took the Oath which the Statutes enjoyn the Preſident at his Admiſſion, and the Oaths of Alegiance and Supremacy; the latter of which he was ordered to take upon his Knees, which he accordingly did. Then their Lordſhips conducted him to the Door of the Preſident's Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, where knocking three times, and the Door not being opened, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Common Room, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion'd <hi>Atterbury</hi> and a Tipſtaff, to fetch a Smith to force it open, which was done, their Lordſhips being preſent all this while. None of the Fellows, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Mr. <hi>Chernock,</hi> aſſiſting, or being ſo much as preſent at either of theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances. Then the Commiſſioners being returned to the Common Room, Dr. <hi>Fairfax</hi> deſired leave, at their lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, to ſpeak; which was granted.</p>

               <p>You are big to be delivered of your own deſtruction. Will you ſubmit to the Biſhop of <hi>Oxon,</hi> as now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled, Preſident, by vertue of the King's Mandate?</p>

            </sp>
            <p>Then the ſame Queſtion was put to the Society, which being a buſineſs of moment, they deſired time till the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon to conſider it.</p>
            <p>Then the Court Adjourned till Three a Clock; at which time the Anſwer was given in by the Society, (except Dr. <hi>Fairfax,</hi> who had given his in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) <q>That whereas His Majeſty hath been pleaſed by his Royal Authority to cauſe the Right Reverend Father in God, <hi>Samuel</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Oxon,</hi> to be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled Preſident; we whoſe Names are hereunto Subſcribed, do ſubmit, as far
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94066:20"/>
as is lawful and agreeable to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Colledge, and no way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the Right and Title of Dr. <hi>Hough.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This Anſwer was accepted, except the laſt Clauſe; which the Lord Chief Juſtice, and Barron <hi>Jenner,</hi> declared, as Judges, to be inſignificant, ſince nothing they could do, could any way invallidate Dr. <hi>Hough</hi>'s Title, but left them ſtill at liberty to be Witneſſes for him, or any other way be ſerviceable to him in the recovery of his Right. Upon this aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lrance, the Society was prevailed with to cave out the laſt Clauſe.</p>
            <p>Then all were commanded to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw: And Dr. <hi>Fairfax</hi> being called in, the <hi>Biſhop</hi> asked him what he meant by his Paper abovementioned, Date <hi>October</hi> the 22d; and whether he did ſubmit to the Authority of the Court?</p>

               <p>As I have denied it above, ſo I do here.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>Then the Court was opened; and the Doctor complained before them all, that he was twice Cloſſeted, and being ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Whether he would obey the Court and Biſhop of <hi>Oxon?</hi> he plainly denied both. Upon which the <hi>Buttery-Book</hi> was called for, and the Biſhop of <hi>Cheſter</hi> commanded his Name to bo ſtruck out: And this Sentance paſſed, <hi>Viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Foraſmuch as you have denied the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Court, and refuſed to obey the Biſhop of</hi> Oxon, <hi>whom the King hath made your Preſident; and taken Commons after your Suſpenſion: We declare your place void, and command you quietly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the Colledge within fourteen days.</hi>

               </speaker>
               <p>My Lords, all the huge Calamities that have befallen me, are of the ſole account of a Religious and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciencious Obſervation of our Pious Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Statutes; whoſe Bread I have eaten almoſt this Thirty Years.</p>

            <p>This Proteſtation was over-ruled, and a Copy of the Sentence denyed, though moſt earneſtly deſired at the inſtance of Dr. <hi>Hedges,</hi> and Mr. Vice-Chancellor, two days after.</p>
            <p>At the cloſe of the Seſſions, their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips declared, that they were very well ſatisfied with the Anſwer the Soiety had given them; and though before they had laid a Libel to their charge, yet, that Night, they declared, they had met with nothing from them but Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and that they ſhould receive the ſame from them; that they had ſhewn themſelves men of excellent tempers this day and before; and that they would repreſent it faithfully above to their advantage, and that if it any way lay in their power to ſerve them, they ſhould be very ready to do it.</p>

            <p>IN the Morning they made it apper to their Lordſhips very ſatisfactorily, that they were obliged to give in Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-money, 2 <hi>l.</hi> 3 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, they gave <hi>communibs annis,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt 100 <hi>l.</hi> as appeared by a Paper they then delivered in.

               <p>Dr. <hi>Hough</hi> being duely Elected and admitted Preſident doth thereby obtain a right, which I am not ſatisfied he hath any way forfeited, and therefore can obey no perſon as Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Gentlemen, Your many Contempts, and wilful Diſobedience, have occaſioned this Viſitation, which will end at last in your ruin. This Society of yours has been long exerciſed in the Methods of Quarrelling; has always been troubled with Factious Spirits, and teſty Mutineers, ever ſince the Reſtoration of the late King: You have encourag'd Quarrels among your ſelves; Quarrels between your ſelves and Preſident; Quarrels, at length, between your ſelves and Viſitor. For I have often heard your late Viſitor complain, that this Society was ever ſtocked with an unquiet and turbulent Generation. By theſe ſteps from quarelling with the Preſident, and Viſitor, you have at last advanced to the highest pitch of Inſolence, to quarrel with your Prince, and affront His Sacred Majeſty. I endeavour'd before, at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening Our Commiſſion, to make you ſenſible of the Scandal that your Diſobedience will bring upon your Religion; how much you ſtain and diſhonour your liberal and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Education, in this Society.</p>
            <p>You cannot but know His Majeſty is your Supream Ordinary. You cannot but have read in <hi>Bracton,</hi> who was twenty years Lord Chief Juſtice under King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the third: <hi>Nemo Preſumat de factis ejus diſquirere ne dum contra factum e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus venire:</hi> All Diſobedience imploys Pride: For no man can diſobey his Governor, but he who thinks himſelf wiſer. The Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Honour of a Prince at home, and His Reſpect abroad, are chief Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of a Government. But theſe Pillars as much as in you lies, you have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to ſhake. And unleſs His Majeſty's Honour and Right be vindicated by us, He can neither be feared at home, nor obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved abroad. Your Puniſhment must be as publick as your Crime. It cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived but His Majeſty in Juſtice, in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, in Clemency, and in His Royal Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, could have proceeded otherways than he has done. On the first of <hi>April</hi> it
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94066:22"/>
was publiſhed that Dr. <hi>Clark</hi> was dead: On the eleventh a <hi>Mandamus</hi> was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you, for chuſing <hi>Mr. Farmer.</hi> On the ninth you preſented a Petition to the Lord Preſident: wherein you laid yourſelves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate at His Majeſties Feet, repreſenting to him the Incapacitie of Mr. <hi>Farmer,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring the benefits of His Gracious Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for preſerving your Rights and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and beſeeching him to Nominate another perſon qualified according to your Statutes, in the Election of whom you would ſhew your ready obedience. So ſaid and ſo done, Gentlemen, had been very well.</p>
            <p>But immediately after the delivery of the Petition, you not waiting His Majeſties Anſwer, proceeded on <hi>April</hi> the <hi>15</hi>th to an Election of <hi>Dr. Hough;</hi> So that by this Act, which was plainly contrary to His Majeſties Authority, whoſe Mandate did certainly imply an Inhibition; you direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confronted your former promiſes of ready obedience, and were reſolved to give the <hi>King</hi> nothing but good words; when you had done this, as men of ill deſigns, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in haſt, for a confirmation of it, you immediately went and ſurprized your Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and by that means perſwaded him to confirm <hi>Dr. Hough,</hi> that very day he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an order from the Lord Preſident to the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this News the <hi>King</hi> was much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, and required an account of your Proceedings; therefore the Lords Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners iſſued out a Citation, and after hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Plea: <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon mature Conſultation with the Learned of both Laws, judged the pretended Election of <hi>Dr. Hough</hi> to be void and null, and him to be removed, by an Inſtrument dated the <gap reason="blank" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈1 span left blank〉</desc>
               </gap> which was affixed on the Gate. After this a Mandate was ſent on the <gap reason="blank" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈1 span left blank〉</desc>
               </gap> to you to Elect the Biſhop of <hi>Oxon;</hi> upon which terms His Majeſty was graciouſly pleaſed to dispence with your diſobedience thitherto. But this being diſobeyed, His Majeſty in Perſon on the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> ſent for you to <hi>Chriſt-Church,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired you immediately to Elect the Biſhop of <hi>Oxon</hi> Preſident. You went ſtrait to the Chappel, a place one would think ſhould have inspired more Devotion and Awe of his Sacred Majeſty in you; and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly Subſcribed and Signed a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, directly thwarting his Majeſties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. The ground of your diſobedience you pretend that you could not Elect him, whereas you could not but know by a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Mandate that lay by you, that admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion would have ſatisfied His Majeſty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience the ſtale Topick of Rebellion was here brought to vindicate your petulant and contumacious behaviour. You preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that you were obliged by Oaths, and I am ſorry that at the ſame time you forgot that of Allegiance. And indeed there is not a greater ſign of Hypocriſie, than par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial obedience. Had you any reſpect to the Father of your Country, and your Mother the Church, you would have Sacrificed your pretended Scruples, as a peace-offering to to the <hi>King.</hi> The beſt of us I am ſure, have reaſon to beg God and the Kings pardon. But you, as if His Majeſty Reigned by courteſie, would have a <hi>King</hi> under you, but none over you. You urged the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of your Statutes, of which as it hath appeared, you have not been ſo conſtant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervers, when your own humour prompts you to a diſpenſation, then you can readily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it; witneſs but that of being ſerved <hi>per Maſculos,</hi> by which great Scandals have come to this Society by reaſon of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards.</p>
            <p>But when the King interpoſed, in whoſe power alone it is to diſpence with them, then you preſently act according to ſuch methods as theſe. None of theſe pretences will eaſe you with wiſe and ſober men.</p>
            <p>This was the onely oppoſition His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty in his Progreſs received: Where-ever his Sacred Majeſty came, he worked a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Converſion, except in <hi>Oxford;</hi> and ſo far ſatisfied every one with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of his Proceedings, that none went away diſcontented from his Preſence, unleſs it was for this reaſon, that they could not enjoy it any longer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> the <hi>20th,</hi> We came down, and upon opening our Commiſſion, I took care to repreſent to you the heighnouſneſs of your Offence, and to perſwade you to a ſerious Repentance; but all in vain.</p>
            <p>For on <hi>Saturday</hi>-morning we required you to Admit and Inſtal the Biſhop of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> which all, except three, refuſed: In
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94066:23"/>
the Afternoon Dr. <hi>Hough</hi> having been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived, and by us commanded to depart the Colledge, came unto us without any leave, but not without great Attendance; Circumſtances, I think, much unbeſitting a man pronounc'd Expelled; and there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a PROTESTATION a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all that we had done, or hereafter ſhould do, as Illegal, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njust, and Null; which he delivered not in Writing, but by Word of Mouth: a thing repugnant to the nature of all Appeals: and which was worſe, without the uſual Salvo to His Majeſty's Supreme Power. When he had ſpoken it, there followed ſuch a Tumultuous, Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Inſolent <hi>HUM,</hi> which if you your ſelves had not applauded, or at least conſented to it, was impoſſible but that you would have diſcovered ſome of thoſe Mutineers. However, ſince his Carriage and Language gave occaſion to it, 'twas thought fit that he onely ſhould be obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and accordingly he was bound o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> we our ſelves cauſed the Biſhop of <hi>Oxon</hi> to be Inſtalled by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xy; after which we propoſed to you, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being now Inſtalled, you would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to him <hi>licitis &amp; honeſtis?</hi> To which you gave an Anſwer under your Hands in the Affirmative. You then alſo deſired of us to repreſent your Caſe favourably to His Majeſty, giving all aſſurance of your Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and Obedience. But this aſſurance of Submiſſion laſted not long; for on <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> being required of us to Subſcribe ſuch a Submiſſion to His Majeſty as we thought agreeable to your Duty, you required time to conſult of it; and after deliberation, Sign'd ſuch a Paper, which ſeem'd rather to be a Proteſtation against your former Submiſſion, than an Acknowledgment of your Crime. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this we might juſtly then have proceeded to an Expulſion: but we thought fit, in compaſſion to you, to take a Journey to <hi>London,</hi> and acquaint His Majeſty with your Diſobedience and ungrateful Behaviour. His Majeſty was extreamly amaz'd that His Clemency ſhould be deſpiſed; but yet, to your comforts be it ſpoken, His Patience and Goodneſs extends as far as your Provocations can: But if you ſtill perſist in your Obſtinacie, thoſe that are too Tall to Stand, and too Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born to Bend, deſerve to be Broken. And now, I think, I have ſaid enough to let you know, that the Figg-leaves you have ſo artificially ſtiched together, are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to cover your Nakedneſs. I wiſh to God you had the ſame tenderneſs for your Concern, as His Majeſty's Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have for you. But if you ſtill perſist to oppoſe the Royal Power of the King, we, who are come to vindicate the Right and Honour of His Majeſty, reſolved to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge our Conſciences and Duties to God and the King, without any reſpect of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity; that's but the Paradiſe of Fools, and Scorn of Wiſe Men: and therefore, as for us, we have no more regard to Peoples diſlike, than what they dream: By reaſon therefore of your late Hypocritical Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the Commiſſioners has thought fit, upon mature conſideration, to draw up an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ſhall be read to you, to which, if you ſhall immediately ſubſcribe, before you leave the Room, we ſhall leave you to His Majeſty's Pardon: And this we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from you all, except Mr. <hi>Tho. Smith</hi> and Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> with whoſe Behaviour the King is ſo well ſatisfied; that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects no more from them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Then all the Fellows being called in, their Lordſhips tendred a Form of Submiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to them to be Signed. Which take as followeth:</hi>

               <p>My Lords, I have been always obedient to His Majeſties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, I was not concerned in the Election of Dr. <hi>Hough</hi>; I voted for Mr. <hi>Farmer,</hi> and am ready to ſubmit to the Biſhop of <hi>Oxon.</hi>

               <p>Did you not put your hand to this Petition? Is not this your hand —Read the Petition—It was Read— In which the Fellows deſired His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, to nominate any qualified Perſon, and to retract His Mandate granted for Mr. <hi>Farmer.</hi>

               <p>My Lord, I conceive the Petition not to be diſobedient. We had not yet receiv'd the Mandate, as ſoon as it came, I humbled my ſelf.</p>

               <p>This Paper requires me to own my diſobedience to His Majeſty; I am not conſcious of any, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot Subſcribe.</p>
