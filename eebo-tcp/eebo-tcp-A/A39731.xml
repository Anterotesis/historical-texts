            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Pre≈øident≈øhip of St. <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> Colledge, in the Univer≈øity of <hi>Oxon,</hi> being void by the death of Dr. <hi>Henry Clerk,</hi> late Pre≈øident of the ≈øame, the Vice-Pre≈øident gave notice to all the Fellows pre≈øent in the Chappel, on <hi>Thur≈øday</hi> the 31 of <hi>March,</hi> 1687; where it was unanimou≈øly agreed, to proceed to the Election of a Pre≈øident, on <hi>Wedne≈øday</hi> the 13 of <hi>April</hi> following, at Nine of the Clock in the Morning, in the Chappel: And in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereto, the Vice-Pre≈øident cau≈øed a Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be fix'd on the Chappel-Door of the ≈øaid Colledge, ≈øignifying the Vacancy, Time, and Place of the Election; according to the direction of the Statutes. But before the day of Election, being credibly informed, that his Maje≈øty had been plea≈øed to grant his Letters Mandatory, in behalf of Mr. <hi>Anthony Farmer,</hi> they mo≈øt humbly repre≈øented to his Sacred Maje≈øty, in their Petition bearing Date <hi>April</hi> 9th, That the ≈øaid Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi> was uncapable, by their Statutes, of being Pre≈øident; and therefore did mo≈øt humbly pray his Maje≈øty to leave them to a Free Election, or recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend ≈øuch a Per≈øon to them, as was capable by their Statutes. <hi>Monday, April</hi> 11th, his Maje≈øty's Letters Mandatory, were delivered by the hands of Mr. <hi>Robert Chernock,</hi> Ma≈øter of Arts, and Fellow of the ≈øaid Colledge, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the Vice-Pre≈øident and Fellows of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge, in <hi>Oxon,</hi> requiring them forthwith to Elect the ≈øaid Mr. <hi>Farmer,</hi> and admit him Pre≈øident: Which Letter the Vice-Pre≈øident read in the Chappel of the ≈øaid Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, between the hours of four and five of the Clock in the ≈øame day, after Evening-Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, before the Fellows of the Colledge, there pre≈øent, and asked them, Whether they in Obedience to his Maje≈øty's Letters, would forthwith Elect and Admit Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi> Pre≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent? Who all agreed, in con≈øideration to Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi>'s not being Qualified, and the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Expul≈øion to any of the Fellows that ≈øhould be ab≈øent from the Election, and that the time of Election, according to the Citati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, was ≈øo near, to defer their An≈øwer till <hi>Wedne≈øday</hi> following: Whereupon the Vice-Pre≈øident required all the Fellows to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent in the Chappel the ≈øaid <hi>Wedne≈øday</hi> Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at nine of the Clock. All the Fellows being then met, the Vice-Pre≈øident read the Statute <hi>De Electione Pre≈øidentis</hi>; and the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> again≈øt corrupt Elections, was read al≈øo; after which the Vice-Pre≈øident read the King's Letter in behalf of Mr. <hi>Farmer,</hi> and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94066:5"/>
the ≈øecond time demanded an An≈øwer of the Fellows thereto. Their An≈øwer was to this effect: That having a Petition now lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Maje≈øty, they ought not to proceed to Election, till they had received his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øty's An≈øwer to the ≈øame: And thereupon they all agreed, (except Mr. <hi>Charnock)</hi> that the Election ≈øhould be deferred: which was accordingly done, until the next Morning nine of the Clock.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thur≈øday, April</hi> 14th, at nine a Clock in the Morning, all the Fellows being met, the Vice-Pre≈øident told them, That the Election of a Pre≈øident had been deferred upon account of their Petition to his Maje≈øty, in An≈øwer to which, they had not then received his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øty's Plea≈øure; that the next day was the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt time they could defer the Election by the Statutes, and therefore it was nece≈ø≈øary they ≈øhould come to ≈øome Re≈øolution: he told them farther, That the King had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to Elect Mr. <hi>Farmer,</hi> and asked their Sen≈øe therein: Which was unanimous (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Mr. <hi>Charnock)</hi> that the Election ≈øhould be deferred till the next morning eight of the Clock; and in order thereunto, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to be admini≈øtred fir≈øt; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly it was Adjourned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday, April</hi> 15th, at eight a Clock in the Morning the Vice-Pre≈øident and Fellows be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing met, Dr. <hi>Tho. Smith</hi> and Capt. <hi>Bag≈øhaw,</hi> two of the Fellows, acquainted the re≈øt, from my Lord Pre≈øident of the Coun≈øel, That in An≈øwer to their Petition, his Maje≈øty having ≈øent his Letter to the Colledge, expected to be Obeyed. After which, the Vice-Pre≈øident read again the King's Letter to them, and ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Whether in Obedience thereunto, they would Elect and Admit Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi> Pre≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent? They an≈øwered, That they de≈øired they might proceed to an Election. Then the Vice-Pre≈øident having propo≈øed, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, having received his Maje≈øty's Plea≈øure in An≈øwer to their Petition, they would make any further Addre≈øs? The Vice-Pre≈øident, Dr. <hi>Fairfax,</hi> Dr. <hi>Pud≈øey,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Tho. Smith,</hi> were for a ≈øecond Addre≈øs; but all the re≈øt declared immediately for proceeding to the Election.</p>
            <p>Then the Vice-Pre≈øident propo≈øed, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they would go to an Election <hi>Viva voce,</hi> or by Scrutiny? The Vice-Pre≈øident, Mr. <hi>Thomp≈øon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Charnock,</hi> were for proceeding to an Election <hi>Viva voce</hi>; all the re≈øt were for going to an Election by Scrutiny, except Dr. <hi>Tho. Smith,</hi> who was not for going to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, until the King ≈øhould again be Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned.</p>
            <p>This therefore being their Sen≈øe, That they ought to proceed to the Election of a Pre≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent according to the Statutes, and this the la≈øt day limited for Election: In order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, the holy Sacrament was ≈øolemnly taken by all, except Mr. <hi>Charnock.</hi> Then the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute <hi>De Electione Prae≈øidentis,</hi> and 5 <hi>Eliz.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt corrupt-Elections was read by the Vice-Pre≈øident. Every one took the Oath pre≈øcribed in the Statutes to be taken, in order to the Nomination of a Pre≈øident, (except Mr. <hi>Thomp≈øon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> who refu≈øed it): And the 2 Senior Fellows were ≈øworn Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators in the Scrutiny of the whole Society: For the Nomination of a Pre≈øident, Mr. <hi>Hough</hi> and Mr. <hi>Maymard</hi> had each of them the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor part of all the Voices; and were accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly pronounced by the Seniour Scrutatour, <hi>Nominati in Ordine ad Electionem Prae≈øidentis:</hi> Then the thirteen Seniour Fellows being met to Elect one of the≈øe two Pre≈øident; and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them ≈øworn according to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute; eleven of them Elected Mr. <hi>Hough,</hi> who was accordingly pronounc'd Pre≈øident of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> Colledge, in <hi>Oxon.</hi> by the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niour Scrutatour, in the pre≈øence of all the Fellows: and Mr. <hi>Maynard</hi> was appointed by the thirteen Seniour Fellows, to pre≈øent the ≈øaid Pre≈øident Elect, to the Vi≈øitour, in order to his Admi≈ø≈øion. After this, Mr. <hi>Thomp≈øon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Charnock</hi> declared, <hi>Viva voce</hi> for Mr. <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi>; according to his Maje≈øty's Letter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday, April</hi> 16th, Mr. <hi>Hough,</hi> Pre≈øident Elect, was pre≈øented to the Vi≈øitour by Mr. <hi>Maynard,</hi> who at the ≈øame time delivered to his Lord≈øhip an In≈øtrument under the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Seal, containing the Proceedings of the Election; after a ≈øight whereof, Mr. <hi>Hough</hi> was Sworn and Admitted Pre≈øident by his Lord≈øhip, according to the Statutes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday, April</hi> 17th, Mr. <hi>Hough</hi> at his return to the Colledge, took the ≈øame Oath again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Society, and afterwards, as Pre≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, took his Seat in the Chappel, at four a Clock Prayers in the Afternoon.</p>

            <p>UPon the Notice of the Death of Dr. <hi>Henry Clark,</hi> Late Pre≈øident of St. <hi>Mary Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalen</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxon</hi>; the Vice-Pre≈øident called a Meeting of the Fellows, in order to appoint a day for the Election of a new Pre≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. The 13th of <hi>April</hi> was the day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd; with power to prorogue the Election to the 15th, as they ≈øhould ≈øee cau≈øe, beyond which time it was not in their power to defer the ≈øame. This being agreed, a Citation, or Praemonition was fix'd upon the Chappel-door of the Colledge, ≈øignifying the ≈øame; and ≈øummoning all the ab≈øent Fellows to repair home to the en≈øuing Election, as the Statute in that ca≈øe directs. After this, upon the 11th of <hi>April,</hi> they receiv'd His Maje≈øty's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in behalf of Mr. <hi>Farmer,</hi> requiring them to elect and admit him Pre≈øident: But he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving never been Fellow of that Colledge, nor <hi>New</hi>-Colledge, in which are the only Per≈øons capable of being cho≈øen by the Statutes; and wanting likewi≈øe ≈øuch per≈øonal Qualifications as are required in the Character of a Pre≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, they did not imagine it was, or could be His Maje≈øty's Plea≈øure, that they ≈øhould act ≈øo directly contrary to the expre≈øs Words of their Statutes, to which they are ≈øtrictly and po≈øitively ≈øworn: But did humbly conceive they were bound in Duty to believe, that His Maje≈øty had been mi≈ø-informed in the Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter and Capacity of Mr. <hi>Farmer.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore on the 15th of <hi>April,</hi> the la≈øt of tho≈øe days within which they were confin'd to fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh the Election, they proceeded to a choice, and having fir≈øt received the Ble≈ø≈øed Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øt, and taken an Oath as the Founder en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns, to choo≈øe a Per≈øon ≈øo qualified, as is there ≈øpecified; they did elect the Reverend Mr. <hi>John Hough,</hi> Batchellor in Divinity, who is a Per≈øon every way qualified by the Satutes of the ≈øaid Colledge: And if it ≈øhall be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected that His Maje≈øty did in His Letter for Mr. <hi>Farmer,</hi> graciou≈øly di≈øpen≈øe with all the Statutes that rendered him uncapable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elected; and that therefore they might have obeyed without breach of their Oaths: They humbly beg leave to repre≈øent, that there is an expre≈øs Clau≈øe in that Oath, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man takes when he is admitted Fellow of the Colledge; wherein he ≈øwears not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, accept, or make u≈øe of any Di≈øpen≈øation from his Oath, or any part thereof, by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever

procured, or by what Authority ≈øoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver granted. As to their former practice when they have elected in obedience to the King's Letter heretofore; it has been always in ≈øuch ca≈øes where the per≈øons recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have been every way qualified for the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice by their Statutes; in which ca≈øes they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have been; and ever will be, ready to comply with His Maje≈øty's plea≈øure; it not being without un≈øpeakable regret, that they di≈øobey the lea≈øt of His Commands.

            <head type="sub">Why they did not obey His Maje≈øty's Letter, requiring them to Elect, and Admit Mr. <hi>Anthony Farmer</hi> Pre≈øident of the ≈øaid Colledge?</head>
            <p>THE ≈øaid Vice-Pre≈øident, and other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Fellows an≈øwered and ≈øaid, That the ≈øaid Colledge of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> in <hi>Oxon</hi> is a Body Corporate, governed by Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Statutes, granted and confirmed to them by His Maje≈øty's Royal Predece≈ø≈øor, King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the 6th, for Him and His Heirs and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øors, under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> which are al≈øo ≈øince confirmed by ≈øeveral other Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents of others of His Maje≈øty's Royal Predece≈ø≈øors, under the Great Seal of <hi>England</hi>‚Äî That by the ≈øaid Statutes of the Colledge (to the ob≈øervation of which, each Fellow is ≈øworn) it is ordered that the Per≈øon elected Pre≈øident thereof, ≈øhall be a Man of good Life and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, of approved Under≈øtanding, and good Temper, Di≈øcreet, Provident, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øpect, both in Spiritual and Temporal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. And at the time of Election of a Pre≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the ≈øaid Fellows are bound by the ≈øaid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, to take an Oath that they ≈øhall nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate none to that Office, but ≈øuch as are, or have been Fellows of the ≈øaid Colledge, or of <hi>New-Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxon:</hi> or if they are not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94066:7"/>
Fellows at that time of Election; that they be ≈øuch as have left their Fellow≈øhips in their re≈øpective Colledges upon credible ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. And when two qualified per≈øons ≈øhall be nominated at the time of Election, by the greater number of all the Fellows, to the ≈øaid Office of Pre≈øident; the thirteen Seniors al≈øo ≈øwear that they will Elect one of them, whom in their Con≈øciences they think mo≈øt proper and ≈øufficient, mo≈øt di≈øcreet, mo≈øt u≈øeful, and be≈øt qualified for the Place; without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to love, hatred, favour, or fear. And every Fellow when he is fir≈øt admitted into his Fellow≈øhip in the ≈øaid Colledge, ≈øwears that he will inviolably keep and ob≈øerve all the Statutes and Ordinances of the Colledge, and every thing therein contained, ≈øo far as does or may concern him, according to the plain, literal, and grammatical ≈øen≈øe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof, and as much as in him lies will cau≈øe the ≈øame to be kept and ob≈øerved by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and that he will not procure any Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpen≈øation contrary to his afore≈øaid Oath, or any part thereof, nor contrary to the Statutes and Ordinances to which it relates, or any of them; nor will he endeavour that ≈øuch Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpen≈øation ≈øhall be procured by any other, or others, publickly or privately, directly or indirectly. And if it ≈øhall happen that any Di≈øpen≈øation of this ≈øort, of what≈øoever Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority it ≈øhall be, whether in general or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, or under what form of Words ≈øoever it be granted, that he will neither make u≈øe of it, nor in any ≈øort con≈øent thereunto. That upon Notice of the Death of Dr. <hi>Clark</hi> Late Pre≈øident of the ≈øaid Colledge, the Vice-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øident called a Meeting of the ≈øaid Fellows, in order to the appointing a day for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of a new Pre≈øident, and the 13th of <hi>April</hi> was the time prefix'd, with power to prorogue the ≈øame as they ≈øhould ≈øee cau≈øe, till the 15th, beyond which time they could not ≈øtatutably defer their Election, and in pur≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance thereof a Citation, or Premonition, was fix'd upon the Chappel-door of the ≈øaid Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ≈øignifying the ≈øame, and by which the ab≈øent Fellows were Summoned to repair home, as the Statute in the Ca≈øe requires. And the ≈øaid Vice-Pre≈øident, and other deputed Fellows farther ≈øay, that on the 11th of <hi>April</hi> afore≈øaid, they received His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øty's Letters Mandatory, to Elect and Admit the ≈øaid Mr. <hi>Anthony Farmer</hi> Pre≈øident of the ≈øaid Colledge: But fora≈ømuch as the ≈øaid Vice-Pre≈øident, and Fellows, apprehended the right of Election to be in them, and believed His Maje≈øty never intended to di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈øs them of their Rights: And fora≈ømuch as the ≈øaid Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi> had never been Fellow either of <hi>Magdalen,</hi> or <hi>New</hi>-Colledge in <hi>Oxon,</hi> and had not tho≈øe Qualifications which in, and by, the ≈øaid Statutes of the Colledge are required in the Character of a Pre≈øident, as they in their Con≈øciences did, or do verily believe; and in regard that they could not comply with His Maje≈øty's Letter, without the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of their Oaths, and hazard of their le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Intere≈øt and Property, wherewith they are by their Statutes po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed, and which by their Oaths they are bound to maintain, they repre≈øented the ≈øame by their humble Petition to His Maje≈øty. And having deferred their Election of a Pre≈øident to the la≈øt day limited by their Statutes, then they proceeded to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, and having fir≈øt received the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øt, and taken the ≈øaid Oaths, as the Statutes enjoyn, to choo≈øe a Per≈øon ≈øo qualified as is before expre≈ø≈øed, they did Elect the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Mr. <hi>John Hough</hi> B. D. and one of the Fellows of their Colledge, a Per≈øon every way qualified to be Pre≈øident, who has been ≈øince confirmed by the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Winton</hi> their Vi≈øitor, as the Statutes of the ≈øaid Colledge direct.</p>
            <p>And that they might not lye under His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty's Di≈øplea≈øure by their Proceedings, they did on the 19th of <hi>April</hi> make an humble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øentation thereof to His Maje≈øty, by his Grace the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> Chancellor of the Univer≈øity of <hi>Oxon,</hi> ≈øetting forth their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di≈øpen≈øable obligations to ob≈øerve their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Statutes.</p>
            <p>All which Matters the Vice-Pre≈øident, and other deputed Fellows, do humbly offer to your Lord≈øhips, and pray to be di≈ømi≈ø≈øed with your Lord≈øhips favour.</p>

            <p>That in <hi>September</hi> 1683. the ≈øaid Mr. <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> was entred in St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> Hall in <hi>Oxon.</hi> where ≈øuch frequent Complaints were brought again≈øt him to the Principal, for his trouble≈øome humour and unquiet temper, that to pre≈øerve the Peace of the Society, he was de≈øired to leave the ≈øaid Hall.</p>
            <p>That after his leaving <hi>Magdalen</hi> Hall, he was admitted into <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge, where di≈øcour≈øing about Religion, he declared, That there was no Prote≈øtant but would cut the Kings Throat: notwith≈øtanding which, at other times he declared to ≈øome of the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows of the ≈øaid Colledge, That what≈øoever he pretended, he was really a Member of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; and that he made an Intere≈øt with ≈øome Roman Catholicks, only to get Preferment by their means, and for that rea≈øon was willing to be thought of their Religion.</p>
            <p>That at the very time when his Maje≈øty's Letter came to the Colledge in his behalf, the ≈øaid Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi> was at <hi>Abbington</hi> in very ill Company, where he continued drinking to exce≈øs two or three days and nights together; and among≈øt other Di≈øorders, was one of tho≈øe that then in the night time threw the Town-Stocks into the River: and that in general the ≈øaid Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi> hath had the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happine≈øs to lie under an ill Fame, as to his Life and Conver≈øation, as by ≈øeveral Letters and Certificates, ready to be produced, will more largely appear.</p>

            <p>For our Founder hath obliged us under Oath, when we came in Fellows, inviolably to ob≈øerve his Statutes, and one Clau≈øe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in injoyns us never to admit, or make u≈øe of Di≈øpen≈øation granted by any Authority what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever, whereby we may be ab≈øolved from the ≈øame. In this Statute for the Election of a Pre≈øident, he commands us upon Oath to Elect ≈øuch a Per≈øon into the place of Pre≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, within 15 days after the vacancy, who either is, or has been Fellow of our own, or <hi>New</hi>-Colledge: Which we repre≈øented to Your Maje≈øty in our humble Petition, ≈øign'd <hi>April</hi> 9th, wherein we offered our ≈øelves rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to Elect any Per≈øon capable of the ≈øame, who Your Maje≈øty ≈øhould be plea≈øed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend, and having waited the utmo≈øt time limited by our Statutes, and receiv'd no An≈øwer to that effect, we did then accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the exigence of our Statutes (having fir≈øt taken the Holy Euchari≈øt, and our ≈øeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Oaths to that purpo≈øe) nominate and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect ≈øuch a Per≈øon, as we in our Con≈øciences did believe to be every way qualified for that Place: By which Act of ours, we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed all that right to him, which our Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hath intru≈øted us with; and it does not lie in our power to admit any other. Our Founder in another Statute obligeth us under the pain of Perjury, a dreadful Anathema, and eternal Damnation, not to ≈øuffer any of his Statutes to be altered, infringed, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpen≈øed with, and commands us under the ≈øame Sacred Obligations, not to execute any Orders or Decree what≈øoever, contrary or repugnant to the ≈øaid Statutes; by which ≈øaid Statutes, and Oaths, we are utterly incapaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated to admit the ≈øaid Reverend Father in God to be our Pre≈øident.</p>
            <p>May it plea≈øe Your Sacred Maje≈øty, to give us leave to lay this our Ca≈øe, and our ≈øelves, withal ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion, at Your Royal Feet, mo≈øt earne≈øtly be≈øeeching Your Sacred Maje≈øty, to extend to us Your humble Petitioners, that

            <p>And Your humble Petitioners ≈øhall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways (as in Duty bound) pray to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, to ble≈øs Your Maje≈øty with a long and happy Reign over us, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to receive You to an immortal Crown of Glory.</p>

            <head>The An≈øwer to the aforementioned written Letter, Dated <hi>Oct. 3</hi>d. <hi>1687.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE inclo≈øed Paper is a Copy of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which by the charitable purpo≈øe of it, ≈øeems to be writ by you, who have been already ≈øo kind as to appear on our behalf, and are reported by all that know you, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy much of your time in doing good to Mankind, and u≈øing your Credit with His Maje≈øty, to undeceive him in any wrong im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions given him of his con≈øcientious Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and where his Ju≈øtice and Goodne≈øs have been thereby abu≈øed, to reconcile the Per≈øons injur'd to His Maje≈øty's Favour, and ≈øecure them by it from Oppre≈ø≈øion and Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. In this confidence, I pre≈øume to make this application to you, de≈øiring your excu≈øe for not ≈øub≈øcribing it: For if you did write the Letter, you know to whom it was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and if you did not, I hope your Charity will induce you to make ≈øuch u≈øe of your light you have by it, into the Affairs of our Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, as to mediate for us with His Maje≈øty, to be re≈øtored to his good opinion, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing which is de≈øired by us, who are zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, above all earthly things, for his Felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Glory.</p>
            <p>We are not con≈øcious of ever giving His Maje≈øty any ju≈øt Offence, as it will appear with you, when you ≈øhall have peru≈øed the enclo≈øed Papers; and have therefore no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon to fear the i≈ø≈øuing out of a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> again≈øt us. And though you are plea≈øed to apprehend it, no in≈øtance can be given of a Judgment again≈øt the Crown, upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs of that Writ: The Learned in the Law tell me, there is nothing more common, and whereof many Ca≈øes are reported by <hi>Kellaway,</hi> from Page 128, to Page 152, of his Book of Reports: And I think I have heard of a Ca≈øe in <hi>Coke</hi>'s ninth Report of the Abbe≈øs of <hi>Prata Marcella,</hi> which evinces the ≈øame; wherein al≈øo there is a recital of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given again≈øt <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> for the King, upon a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> in Court of <hi>Eyre,</hi> revers'd for Errour in the King's-Bench. We hope though we have many Statutes, it will be found that we have not wilfully tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre≈øs'd any of them, for all our pre≈øent Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles are derived to us from our adherence to them, and our fear to offend God, and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øh our Con≈øciences, by departing from them.</p>
            <p>His Maje≈øty is intentionally righteous and ju≈øt in all his Proceedings, He will never knowingly invade any Man's Property, as He was ≈øolemnly plea≈øed to declare in his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Speech made in Council, on the 6th of <hi>February,</hi> 1684, at his Acce≈ø≈øion to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; which is again repeated in His gracious Declaration for Liberty of Con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, of the 4th of <hi>April</hi> la≈øt pa≈øt. It is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on His Sacred inviolable, and Royal Word and Promi≈øe, we mu≈øt depend; not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but when His Maje≈øty ≈øhall be rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of our Ca≈øe, in reference to both His Mandatory Letters to our Colledge, His An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger towards us will be totally extingui≈øhed.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94066:14"/>
Our compliance to the fir≈øt (which was Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi>'s Election) would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd us in the guilt of manife≈øt Perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the wilful violation of our Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes: And we are confident his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øty would never have granted the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond on the behalf of my Lord Bi≈øhop of <hi>Oxon,</hi> if he had known we were then po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd of a Pre≈øident duly Elected ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our Statutes, and confirmed by the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Winton,</hi> our Vi≈øitor (as the Statutes require); and if he is thereby inve≈øted with a Lay-Freehold under the protection of his Maje≈øties Laws, which we cannot undo or attempt to invade, without ≈øubjecting our ≈øelves to Suits at Law, and doing an apparent injury to the Pre≈øident, who doth not conceive him≈øelf to be affected with the Sentence of the Lords Commi≈ø≈øionets, (to which he was no Party) whereby his Place is declared void, without any Citations, Summons, or hearing of him.</p>
            <p>I believe no in≈øtance can be given of a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> brought again≈øt a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or Hall in the Univer≈øities, from the fir≈øt foundation of them to this day, or any other Eccle≈øia≈øtical Corporation: for the Abu≈øes of ≈øome Con≈øtitutions or Franchi≈øes in them, and the Mi≈ødemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of particular Per≈øons, will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy a Colledge: And if the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Colledge ≈øhould be di≈ø≈øolv'd, the Revenues thereof will return to the Founders Heirs, and not divolve to the Crown. And if our Colledge mu≈øt be the fir≈øt Example of that kind, we ≈øhall be better ju≈øtified by the ≈øtrict Ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our Statutes, (at lea≈øt to God and our own Con≈øciences) than we could have been by a voluntary and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate Breach of them.</p>
            <p>It was Loyalty and Con≈øcience, that in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Fir≈øt, made thirty four of our forty Fellows, and mo≈øt of the Scholars of our Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rather quit their Places, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Mi≈øery and Ruine, than to ≈øubmit to the Government of the U≈øurpers of the Crown. And in <hi>Monmouth</hi>'s Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, the ≈øame Inducements prevailed on us to rai≈øe a Company at our own charges, under the command of one of our Fellows, to engage again≈øt him. And we hope that the≈øe and many other the like in≈øtances, which may be given of the Loyalty and Zeal of our Society to the Royal Family, will be received as Evidences thereof, and that our good and gracious Soveraign will not exclude us from that Liberty of Con≈øcience, which he was pleas'd to extend to all his Subjects.</p>

            <head>AN Account of the VISITATION OF St <hi>Mary Magdalen Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxon.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>ON <hi>Oct.</hi> 19th, Mr. <hi>Atterbury</hi> the King's Me≈ø≈øenger, fix'd a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on the Colledge and Chappel-Doors, requiring the Pretended Pre≈øident and Fellows, and other Members of the Colledge to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Lords Commi≈ø≈øioners, Bi≈øhop of <hi>Che≈øter,</hi> Lord Chief Ju≈øtice <hi>Wright,</hi> and Mr. Barron <hi>Jenner,</hi> in the Chappel, at Nine of the Clock on <hi>Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>-morning, <hi>November</hi> 21≈øt.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Thur≈øday</hi> the Lords Commi≈ø≈øio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners came to <hi>Oxon,</hi> attended with three Troops of Hor≈øe which Quarter there.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Friday</hi>- Morning at Nine they went into the Chappel; the Pre≈øident and Fellows thinking they had de≈øign'd to fit in the Quire, made no preparation of Seats in the outward Chappel; upon which their Lord≈øhips adjourned to the Hall, where their Commi≈ø≈øion was then read, which in general was the ≈øame with the former: The≈øe three being added to the other Lords Commi≈ø≈øio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and particularly impowred to vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øit <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge only.</p>
            <p>This done, the Names of the Pre≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Fellows were called over, Dr. <hi>Hough</hi> being fir≈øt called. All in Town appeared, (except Dr. <hi>Fairfax</hi>) and excu≈øes were made for the ab≈øent.</p>
            <p>Then a Speech was made by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhop of <hi>Che≈øter,</hi> and in it his Lord≈øhip was Severe again≈øt Di≈øloyalty and Di≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience. He urg'd that the Church of <hi>England</hi> taught an unconditionate and unlimited Obedience; He ≈øpake of the Kings Gracious Promi≈øes to Arch-Bi≈øhops and Bi≈øhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which had de≈øerved thanks on bended Knees, notwith≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Oxon</hi> Rea≈øons to the contrary which they knew be≈øt who was the Authour thereof. He told them that it could not be expected, but that the King would give all incouragement to tho≈øe of his own Religion, which could be done without ≈øeverity and cruelty which His Maje≈øty abhorr'd, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injuring the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which was at pre≈øent e≈øtabli≈øh'd by Law: He told them that this Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as well as others were the Creatures of the Crown; and that it was in≈øolence in their Local Statutes to ≈øpurn again≈øt their Maker.</p>
            <p>That their Di≈øtempers had brought this Vi≈øitation upon them, the Con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of which might be ill to the Church and Univer≈øities: That however they might e≈øcape in this World, the≈øe Sins were to be accounted for above their other Sins in the next. He Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them by the Bowels of Chri≈øt to con≈øider the≈øe things: He told them, that the Eyes of the World were upon them, and they ought to take care that their Practices might not influence their deluded admirers. In ≈øhort, the whole de≈øign of the Speech ≈øeem'd to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes and threats, to aime at the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing them to a complyance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Court was then Adjourned till Two in the Afternoon.</hi>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                  <p>My Lords, I do declare here in the name of my ≈øelf, and the greater part of the Fellows; that we ≈øubmit to the Vi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, as far as it is con≈øi≈øtent with the Laws of the Land, and the Statutes of the Colledge, and no further.

                  <p>You cannot imagine that we Act contrary to the Laws of the Land, and as to the Statutes the King has di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øed with them: Do you think we come here to act again≈øt Laws.</p>

                  <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                  <p>It does not become me (my Lords) to ≈øay ≈øo, but I'le be plain with your Lord≈øhips; I find that your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion gives you Authority to change and alter the Statutes, and make new ones as you think fit: Now my Lords we have an Oath, not only to ob≈øerve the≈øe Statutes (laying his hand on the Book) but to admit of no new ones, or alterations in the≈øe; This mu≈øt be my behaviour here, I mu≈øt admit of no alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from it, and by the Grace of God never will.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Pr.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not ≈øay, but that his Maje≈øty may alter our Statutes, nor do I know but a Parliament may do the ≈øame; I di≈øpute not their Power: onely this, my Lord, I ≈øay, that I who already have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken an Oath to ob≈øerve the≈øe Statutes as they now ≈øtand, and am ≈øworn not to admit of any change or alteration by any Authority what≈øoever, [<hi>And then turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Oath where they were to ob≈øerve the≈øe Statutes and no other, according to the Literal and Grammatical ≈øence,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and reading it to their Lord≈øhips.</hi>] can

               </sp>

                  <p>My Lord, We did till the very la≈øt day wherein we are limited to fini≈øh the Election; and my Lord <hi>Sunderland</hi> returned, in the King's name, this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer, That his Maje≈øty expected to be obeyed. Now, my Lord, we did no longer defer the Election, becau≈øe our Statutes enjoyn us within ≈øuch a time, and we ≈øtaid to the utmo≈øt.

                  <p>My Lords, we never deliver up the Keys to the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Winton</hi>; and we own no greater Vi≈øitatorial Power than his, he hath the King's Authority. 'Tis by Verttue of a Royal Charter that we live together, and enjoy the benefit of this Place, that impower'd our Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to give us a Rule, and obliged us by Oath to act ≈øuitable unto it: and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhop of <hi>Winton</hi> is hereby con≈øtituted to be our Vi≈øitor; and all this we own from the King's Authority. The Bi≈øhop of <hi>Winton</hi> is our ordinary Vi≈øitor; the King (I pre≈øume) our extraordinary. But your Lord≈øhips know it hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover≈øed, Whether the King can vi≈øit a private Colledge or not? The Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Pre≈øident is made by delivering up the Statute-Book, and Keys; and therefore I look upon them as an e≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Badge of my Office.</p>
                  <p>But I humbly beg that I may ask your Lord≈øhips one Que≈øtion.</p>
                  <p>Your Lord≈øhip is plea≈øed to demand of me to give up the≈øe things: Does your Lord≈øhip own my Right? For if not, which is it your Lord≈øhips would have me give up?</p>

It is very probable that through ignorance and inadverten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy I may expre≈øs my ≈øelf unwarily: If ≈øo I be≈øeech your Lord≈øhip let no advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage be taken of it, my intention has been always to expre≈øs my ≈øelf with all imaginable Duty to the King, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpects to your Lord≈øhips.

And now my Lords, thus far have I appear'd before you as Judges; I now addre≈øs to you as Men of Honour, and Gentlemen, I be≈øeech you to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent me as dutiful to His Maje≈øty to the la≈øt Degree, as I always will be, ≈øo far as my Con≈øcience permits me, to the la≈øt moment of my Life; and when I am di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈øt here, I hope your Lord≈øhips will interceed, that I may no longer lie under His Maje≈øty's Di≈øplea≈øure, or be frown'd upon by my Prince, which is the greate≈øt Affliction can befall me.</p>

               <p>The Pre≈øident being withdrawn, the Bi≈øhop put the Que≈øtion to all the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Whether they would a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt at the Admi≈ø≈øion of the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Oxford</hi> to be in≈øtalled Pre≈øident by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the King's <hi>Mandate?</hi> To which was an≈øwered by all the Fellows, to this effect: (except Dr. <hi>Pud≈øey,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Tho.

               <p>Then all were ordered to withdraw; and Dr. <hi>Pud≈øey</hi> being called in alone, they asked him concerning the Manner and Form of In≈øtalling a Pre≈øident; which he in≈øtructed them in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Court Adjourn'd till Two in the Afternoon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AS ≈øoon as they met, a Letter from the E. of <hi>Sunderland</hi> to Dr. <hi>Pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øey,</hi> was read, dated the 2d of <hi>Augu≈øt,</hi> ≈øignifying<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> That the Society, in an≈øwer to his Maje≈øty's Letter commanding them to admit the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed unanimou≈øly in this An≈øwer, That the place was full. Their Lord≈øhips were plea≈øed to ask the Fellows ≈øingly, Whether that was their An≈øwer? And as many as were there, owned that it was.</p>
               <p>During this Examination, the Pre≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent came into Court, and having wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed until it was ended, and their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhips at a Pau≈øe, he made his Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them: <q>My Lords, if your Lord≈øhips plea≈øe to give me leave, I would gladly ≈øpeak a few words.</q> They were all plea≈øed to put off their Hats, and ≈øay he might. Whereupon he ≈øaid, <q>My Lords, you were plea≈øed this Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in pur≈øuance to a Decree of the Lords Commi≈ø≈øioners at <hi>London,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of my place of Pre≈øident of this Colledge, and to ≈øtrike my Name out of the <hi>Buttery-book:</hi> I do hereby prote≈øt again≈øt all your Proceedings, and again≈øt all that you have done, or hereafter ≈øhall do in prejudice of me and my Right, as Illegal, Unju≈øt, and Null: and therefore I appeal to my Soveraign Lord the King in his Courts of Ju≈øtice.</q> Upon which the Strangers and young Scholars in the Room gave a <hi>H<g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>M</hi>; which ≈øo much incen≈øed their Lord≈øhips, that notwith≈øtanding all the Prote≈øtations the Pre≈øident and Fellows could make, the Pre≈øident in particular offering to purge him≈øelf by Oath, that he was no way acce≈ø≈øary to or abetting of it, and declared that he was heartily a≈øhamed and troubled at it; yet the L.C.J. was not to be pacified, but char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it upon the Pre≈øident, bound him in a Bond of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and Security to the like value, to make his Appearance at the <hi>Kings-Bench-Bar,</hi> the 12th of <hi>Nov.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this, was read the An≈øwer the Fellows returned to his Maje≈øty upon his Command to them upon the 4th of <hi>Sept.</hi> to elect the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Oxford:</hi> the An≈øwer was under the hand of a publick Notary, ≈øub≈øcribed by all the Fellows then pre≈øent, except Mr. <hi>Chernock.</hi> The Bi≈øhop of <hi>Che≈øter</hi> was plea≈øed to charge the Fellows of Unmannerline≈øs, for ≈øend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øuch an An≈øwer to their Prince after ≈øuch a manner.</p>

                  <p>ON <hi>Friday</hi> la≈øt, in the afternoon, you ≈øeem'd to in≈øi≈øt very much on this, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That his Maje≈øty in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the Fellows of the ≈øaid Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to Elect Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi> Pre≈øident, did thereby inhibit them to Elect any other Per≈øon what≈øoever; which has not yet been made appear to be Law, either out of the Books of Civil, Canon, or Common Law. Neither is it agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Rea≈øon, that a Command to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect a Per≈øon uncapable, ≈øhould include in it an Obligation not to Elect a Per≈øon capable, that being a kind of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction <hi>in ternimis.</hi> Yet this being granted, it cannot in the lea≈øt affect the ≈øaid Fellows, or invalidate their Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Dr. <hi>Hough,</hi> notwith≈øtanding his Maje≈øties <hi>Mandate</hi> in behalf of Mr. <hi>Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> who being incapable of the place, the Fellows cannot be ≈øaid to be guilty of any Di≈øobedience or Di≈øloyalty, in proceeding to the Election of another Per≈øon who was quallified according to Statute, being forced to make an Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. For they are oblig'd by the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of their Colledge, (when call'd together) to Elect a Pre≈øident, or any Officer under pain of perpetual Expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion from the Colledge, to meet and make an Election; which puni≈øhment they incur <hi>ip≈øo facto,</hi> who either refu≈øe to meet when ≈øo call'd, or being met, to nominate or elect a per≈øon into the Office void, as appears by the Statutes of the ≈øaid Colledge: <hi>Titulo de nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro Scholdrium &amp; electione Prae≈øidentis.</hi> Now, according to the Founders dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the ≈øaid Statute, on the 15th of <hi>April</hi> la≈øt, the Fellows were call'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the Vice-Pre≈øident to Elect a Pre≈øident in the place of Dr. <hi>Clark</hi> deceas'd, and the Oath de≈øired to be taken before the Election was admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øtred by the Vice-Pre≈øident to them, whereby they are oblig'd to nominate and elect a per≈øon that either is or has been Fellow of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge or <hi>New</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxon</hi>; which Oath when the Fellows had taken, it was not in their power to elect Mr. <hi>Farmer</hi>; and yet they were then oblig'd to make an Election under pain of perpetual a motion from the Colledge, as appears by the forecited Statute. And it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be imagin'd that his mo≈øt Sacred Maje≈øty did expect that the Fellows ≈øhould be either perjur'd, or forfeit their Right to their Fellow≈øhips, rather than di≈øobey his Command; his Maje≈øty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mo≈øt graciou≈øly declar'd, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience ought not to be forced, and that none of his Subjects ≈øhould be mole≈øted in the enjoyment of their Rights and

Priviledges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now that our Procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings at the Election cannot lay any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of our Di≈øobedience or Di≈øloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty upon us, will thus be made appear: Either we had the power to Elect a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øident, or we had not; if we had not, to what end or purpo≈øe did his Maje≈øty command us to elect one? if we had, our power was either re≈øtrain'd to Per≈øons ≈øo and ≈øo quallified, or we were at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to chu≈øe whom we pleas'd; but we could not do the latter, as appears by our Statutes: and therefore we could not elect Mr. <hi>Farmer,</hi> being not inve≈øted with any power to elect a Per≈øon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quallified. And if we had ≈øo done, our Election would have been null and void in it ≈øelf, and the Per≈øon elected liable to be turn'd out by our Vi≈øitor.</p>
                  <p>As for the Decree of his Maje≈øty's Commi≈ø≈øioners (in pur≈øuance of which your Lord≈øhips have admoni≈øh'd Doctor <hi>Hough</hi> to receed from the place of Pre≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and quietly to re≈øign the Keys of his Office, and have ≈øtruck his Name out of the Colledge-Book) we humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it to be null and void in it ≈øelf, to all intents and purpo≈øes, Dr. <hi>Hough</hi> being thereby depriv'd of Freehold for life, (of which he was duly and legally po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈øt) without ever being call'd to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his Right, or any Mi≈ødemeanour ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected again≈øt him.

            <p>After this Mr. <hi>Wiggins,</hi> Chaplain to the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Oxford,</hi> was called in, who delivered a Paper impowering him as Proxy, to be In≈øtalled Pre≈øident for his Lord; which being read, together with the King's Mandate for the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Oxon</hi>; which Letters is as follows. The que≈øtion was put to two or three of the Seniours, Whether they would a≈ø≈øi≈øt at this In≈øtalment? which they refu≈øing, the Court Adjourned to the Chappel, where the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Che≈øter</hi> put Mr. <hi>Wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins</hi> into the Pre≈øident's Stall, where he took the Oath which the Statutes enjoyn the Pre≈øident at his Admi≈ø≈øion, and the Oaths of Alegiance and Supremacy; the latter of which he was ordered to take upon his Knees, which he accordingly did. Then their Lord≈øhips conducted him to the Door of the Pre≈øident's Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, where knocking three times, and the Door not being opened, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the Common Room, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion'd <hi>Atterbury</hi> and a Tip≈øtaff, to fetch a Smith to force it open, which was done, their Lord≈øhips being pre≈øent all this while.

as is lawful and agreeable to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of the Colledge, and no way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the Right and Title of Dr. <hi>Hough.</hi>

            <p>This An≈øwer was accepted, except the la≈øt Clau≈øe; which the Lord Chief Ju≈øtice, and Barron <hi>Jenner,</hi> declared, as Judges, to be in≈øignificant, ≈øince nothing they could do, could any way invallidate Dr. <hi>Hough</hi>'s Title, but left them ≈øtill at liberty to be Witne≈ø≈øes for him, or any other way be ≈øerviceable to him in the recovery of his Right. Upon this a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lrance, the Society was prevailed with to cave out the la≈øt Clau≈øe.</p>
            <p>Then all were commanded to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw: And Dr. <hi>Fairfax</hi> being called in, the <hi>Bi≈øhop</hi> asked him what he meant by his Paper abovementioned, Date <hi>October</hi> the 22d; and whether he did ≈øubmit to the Authority of the Court?</p>

               <p>My Lords, all the huge Calamities that have befallen me, are of the ≈øole account of a Religious and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øciencious Ob≈øervation of our Pious Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Statutes; who≈øe Bread I have eaten almo≈øt this Thirty Years.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Gentlemen, Your many Contempts, and wilful Di≈øobedience, have occa≈øioned this Vi≈øitation, which will end at last in your ruin. This Society of yours has been long exerci≈øed in the Methods of Quarrelling; has always been troubled with Factious Spirits, and te≈øty Mutineers, ever ≈øince the Re≈øtoration of the late King: You have encourag'd Quarrels among your ≈øelves; Quarrels between your ≈øelves and Pre≈øident; Quarrels, at length, between your ≈øelves and Vi≈øitor. For I have often heard your late Vi≈øitor complain, that this Society was ever ≈øtocked with an unquiet and turbulent Generation. By the≈øe ≈øteps from quarelling with the Pre≈øident, and Vi≈øitor, you have at last advanced to the highest pitch of In≈øolence, to quarrel with your Prince, and affront His Sacred Maje≈øty. I endeavour'd before, at the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening Our Commi≈ø≈øion, to make you ≈øen≈øible of the Scandal that your Di≈øobedience will bring upon your Religion; how much you ≈øtain and di≈øhonour your liberal and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Education, in this Society.</p>
            <p>You cannot but know His Maje≈øty is your Supream Ordinary. You cannot but have read in <hi>Bracton,</hi> who was twenty years Lord Chief Ju≈øtice under King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the third: <hi>Nemo Pre≈øumat de factis ejus di≈øquirere ne dum contra factum e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus venire:</hi> All Di≈øobedience imploys Pride: For no man can di≈øobey his Governor, but he who thinks him≈øelf wi≈øer. The Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and Honour of a Prince at home, and His Re≈øpect abroad, are chief Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards of a Government. But the≈øe Pillars as much as in you lies, you have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to ≈øhake. And unle≈øs His Maje≈øty's Honour and Right be vindicated by us, He can neither be feared at home, nor ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved abroad. Your Puni≈øhment must be as publick as your Crime. It cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived but His Maje≈øty in Ju≈øtice, in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, in Clemency, and in His Royal Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derne≈øs, could have proceeded otherways than he has done. On the first of <hi>April</hi> it
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94066:22"/>
was publi≈øhed that Dr. <hi>Clark</hi> was dead: On the eleventh a <hi>Mandamus</hi> was direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you, for chu≈øing <hi>Mr. Farmer.</hi> On the ninth you pre≈øented a Petition to the Lord Pre≈øident: wherein you laid your≈øelves pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrate at His Maje≈øties Feet, repre≈øenting to him the Incapacitie of Mr. <hi>Farmer,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiring the benefits of His Gracious Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for pre≈øerving your Rights and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, and be≈øeeching him to Nominate another per≈øon qualified according to your Statutes, in the Election of whom you would ≈øhew your ready obedience. So ≈øaid and ≈øo done, Gentlemen, had been very well.</p>
            <p>But immediately after the delivery of the Petition, you not waiting His Maje≈øties An≈øwer, proceeded on <hi>April</hi> the <hi>15</hi>th to an Election of <hi>Dr. Hough;</hi> So that by this Act, which was plainly contrary to His Maje≈øties Authority, who≈øe Mandate did certainly imply an Inhibition; you direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confronted your former promi≈øes of ready obedience, and were re≈øolved to give the <hi>King</hi> nothing but good words; when you had done this, as men of ill de≈øigns, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in ha≈øt, for a confirmation of it, you immediately went and ≈øurprized your Vi≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and by that means per≈øwaded him to confirm <hi>Dr. Hough,</hi> that very day he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived an order from the Lord Pre≈øident to the contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>pon this News the <hi>King</hi> was much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed, and required an account of your Proceedings; therefore the Lords Commi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øioners i≈ø≈øued out a Citation, and after hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Plea: <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>pon mature Con≈øultation with the Learned of both Laws, judged the pretended Election of <hi>Dr. Hough</hi> to be void and null, and him to be removed, by an In≈øtrument dated the <gap reason="blank" extent="1 span">

But this being di≈øobeyed, His Maje≈øty in Per≈øon on the <hi>4th</hi> of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> ≈øent for you to <hi>Chri≈øt-Church,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired you immediately to Elect the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Oxon</hi> Pre≈øident. You went ≈øtrait to the Chappel, a place one would think ≈øhould have inspired more Devotion and Awe of his Sacred Maje≈øty in you; and there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuou≈øly Sub≈øcribed and Signed a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, directly thwarting his Maje≈øties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. The ground of your di≈øobedience you pretend that you could not Elect him, whereas you could not but know by a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Mandate that lay by you, that admi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion would have ≈øatisfied His Maje≈øty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience the ≈øtale Topick of Rebellion was here brought to vindicate your petulant and contumacious behaviour. You preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that you were obliged by Oaths, and I am ≈øorry that at the ≈øame time you forgot that of Allegiance. And indeed there is not a greater ≈øign of Hypocri≈øie, than par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial obedience. Had you any re≈øpect to the Father of your Country, and your Mother the Church, you would have Sacrificed your pretended Scruples, as a peace-offering to to the <hi>King.</hi> The be≈øt of us I am ≈øure, have rea≈øon to beg God and the Kings pardon. But you, as if His Maje≈øty Reigned by courte≈øie, would have a <hi>King</hi> under you, but none over you. You urged the ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of your Statutes, of which as it hath appeared, you have not been ≈øo con≈øtant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervers, when your own humour prompts you to a di≈øpen≈øation, then you can readily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it; witne≈øs but that of being ≈øerved <hi>per Ma≈øculos,</hi> by which great Scandals have come to this Society by rea≈øon of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtards.</p>
            <p>But when the King interpo≈øed, in who≈øe power alone it is to di≈øpence with them, then you pre≈øently act according to ≈øuch methods as the≈øe. None of the≈øe pretences will ea≈øe you with wi≈øe and ≈øober men.</p>
            <p>This was the onely oppo≈øition His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty in his Progre≈øs received: Where-ever his Sacred Maje≈øty came, he worked a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Conver≈øion, except in <hi>Oxford;</hi> and ≈øo far ≈øatisfied every one with the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of his Proceedings, that none went away di≈øcontented from his Pre≈øence, unle≈øs it was for this rea≈øon, that they could not enjoy it any longer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>October</hi> the <hi>20th,</hi> We came down, and upon opening our Commi≈ø≈øion, I took care to repre≈øent to you the heighnou≈øne≈øs of your Offence, and to per≈øwade you to a ≈øerious Repentance; but all in vain.</p>
            <p>For on <hi>Saturday</hi>-morning we required you to Admit and In≈øtal the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> which all, except three, refu≈øed: In
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:94066:23"/>
the Afternoon Dr. <hi>Hough</hi> having been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived, and by us commanded to depart the Colledge, came unto us without any leave, but not without great Attendance; Circum≈øtances, I think, much unbe≈øitting a man pronounc'd Expelled; and there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a PROTESTATION a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all that we had done, or hereafter ≈øhould do, as Illegal, <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>njust, and Null; which he delivered not in Writing, but by Word of Mouth: a thing repugnant to the nature of all Appeals: and which was wor≈øe, without the u≈øual Salvo to His Maje≈øty's Supreme Power. When he had ≈øpoken it, there followed ≈øuch a Tumultuous, Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and In≈øolent <hi>HUM,</hi> which if you your ≈øelves had not applauded, or at least con≈øented to it, was impo≈ø≈øible but that you would have di≈øcovered ≈øome of tho≈øe Mutineers. However, ≈øince his Carriage and Language gave occa≈øion to it, 'twas thought fit that he onely ≈øhould be obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and accordingly he was bound o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Tue≈øday</hi> we our ≈øelves cau≈øed the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Oxon</hi> to be In≈øtalled by his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xy; after which we propo≈øed to you, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, being now In≈øtalled, you would ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to him <hi>licitis &amp; hone≈øtis?</hi> To which you gave an An≈øwer under your Hands in the Affirmative. You then al≈øo de≈øired of us to repre≈øent your Ca≈øe favourably to His Maje≈øty, giving all a≈ø≈øurance of your Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and Obedience. But this a≈ø≈øurance of Submi≈ø≈øion la≈øted not long; for on <hi>Thur≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> being required of us to Sub≈øcribe ≈øuch a Submi≈ø≈øion to His Maje≈øty as we thought agreeable to your Duty, you required time to con≈øult of it; and after deliberation, Sign'd ≈øuch a Paper, which ≈øeem'd rather to be a Prote≈øtation against your former Submi≈ø≈øion, than an Acknowledgment of your Crime. <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>pon this we might ju≈øtly then have proceeded to an Expul≈øion: but we thought fit, in compa≈ø≈øion to you, to take a Journey to <hi>London,</hi> and acquaint His Maje≈øty with your Di≈øobedience and ungrateful Behaviour. His Maje≈øty was extreamly amaz'd that His Clemency ≈øhould be de≈øpi≈øed; but yet, to your comforts be it ≈øpoken, His Patience and Goodne≈øs extends as far as your Provocations can: But if you ≈øtill per≈øist in your Ob≈øtinacie, tho≈øe that are too Tall to Stand, and too Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born to Bend, de≈øerve to be Broken. And now, I think, I have ≈øaid enough to let you know, that the Figg-leaves you have ≈øo artificially ≈øtiched together, are not ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to cover your Nakedne≈øs. I wi≈øh to God you had the ≈øame tenderne≈øs for your Concern, as His Maje≈øty's Commi≈ø≈øio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have for you. But if you ≈øtill per≈øist to oppo≈øe the Royal Power of the King, we, who are come to vindicate the Right and Honour of His Maje≈øty, re≈øolved to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge our Con≈øciences and Duties to God and the King, without any re≈øpect of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity; that's but the Paradi≈øe of Fools, and Scorn of Wi≈øe Men: and therefore, as for us, we have no more regard to Peoples di≈ølike, than what they dream: By rea≈øon therefore of your late Hypocritical Submi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, the Commi≈ø≈øioners has thought fit, upon mature con≈øideration, to draw up an In≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ≈øhall be read to you, to which, if you ≈øhall immediately ≈øub≈øcribe, before you leave the Room, we ≈øhall leave you to His Maje≈øty's Pardon: And this we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from you all, except Mr. <hi>Tho.

               <p>My Lords, I am as ready to comply with the King's plea≈øure, as any man living; neither do I know, that we have ever in this place been di≈øobedient to the King, where it was in our power to obey His Commands: Our Founder in the fir≈øt clau≈øe of the Oath we take at this Election, has provided; that no one ≈øhall be Pre≈øident of His Colledge, but who was bred in it, or in the Colledge where he him≈øelf was bred.
