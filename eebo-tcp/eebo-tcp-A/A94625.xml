         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

encreaſing exceedingly both in numbers and ſtrength from meane and low beginnings (being then too much contemned)
and withall obſerving to what an height of villany and impiety they are growne through their diſſembled pretences and Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of mainetaining the true reformed Proteſtant Religion, the Liberty of the Subject and priviledges of Parliament: In the
meane time, without any touch of conſcience, and in defiance of God, raiſing an Army of Papiſts, Outlawes, and Traytors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
all incited and provoked to the robbing, burning, murthering and deſtroying of the Religious, honeſt, and well meaning peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
And that not by a foraigne enemy, but (to the aſtoniſhment of all good men) by him whom the people of this Nation
have highly honoured as their King, and uſed with abundance of love and indulgence, whereof he hath made no better uſe than
to bring them to ſlavery or deſtruction, as thouſands of our deare Brethren have found by moſt wofull experience: To effect which (open and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
violence being not ſufficient) the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebels are invited, and a moſt helliſh plot contrived, and countenanced by the Kings owne Hand, and the
Great Seale. Which (had it taken effect (as bleſſed be God it did not) it had made one of the moſt wofull bleeding ſpectacles that ever the world
beheld, ſufficient to witneſſe unto all men, that the Authours and approvers thereof have ſold themſelves to worke all manner of wickedneſſe;
which yet is made more evident by a late, moſt unjuſt, and ſcandalous Proclamation, therein defaming, and (as much as in them lay) diſſolving
the Parliament, againſt the fundamentall conſtitution of the Kingdome, and an expreſſe Act made this very Parliament, putting all wiſe and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
men out of doubt, that there remaineth no more hope of reducing ſuch wolviſh diſpoſitions by perſwaſions and right reaſon (which have
beene too long applyed in vaine,) but by powerfull force and conſtraint.</p>
            <p>Having alſo obſerved (with greateſt thankfulneſſe) the manifold endeavours of this Honourable Houſe, for ſuppreſſing theſe Outlawes and Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
being aided and aſſiſted therein with Men and Moneyes from all parts of the Kingdome, amounting to a great and numerous Army, and many
reſolved parties in diverſe Counties, and yet all of them not ſufficent to diſſolve their Forces, or not ſo ſuddenly as the neceſſities of the people doe
require, thouſands of them being liable to miſery through decay of Trade, and ready to periſh as much through poverty and want of neceſſaries, as
through violence. And notwithſtanding the confidence repoſed in the faithfulneſſe and courage of his <hi>Excellency</hi> our Noble Generall, and in the
undaunted ſpirits of thoſe under his Command, that have voluntarily devoted their lives and eſtates to the ſervice of the Commonwealth: yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the doubtfull hazzards of warre, the miſerable conſequences of prolonging thereof; the perilous relying of this ſo populous a Kingdome
upon one Army, the manifold miſeries and diſtreſſes of our Brethren in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and multitudes of our Brethren in moſt parts of this Kingdome, and
the inevitable ruine which is even ready to ſeize upon us all, if not very ſpeedily prevented; The cowardize wherewith we ſhall be branded to all
poſterity, if (when ſo many of our Brethren are hazarding their lives, and the reſt of the Kingdome would doe the like by our example) we ſhould
preferre our preſent eaſe and ſloth before the purchaſe of a ſound and laſting peace, and the quiet injoyment of that Religion, and thoſe Liberties that
God hath indowed us withall: We are pierced at our hearts, and our ſpirits even burne within us, that we can no longer remaine ſilent, but are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to addreſſe our ſelves in our uſuall and lawfull way, and to become moſt earneſt and humble ſuitors to this moſt High and Honourable
Houſe, that as in your Wiſdomes, you have thought meete by diverſe and ſundry Orders to invite all well-affected men in all parts, to appeare and
lay out themſelves for reſtraint of the common enemies, ſo you would be pleaſed to make uſe of ſome more powerfull meanes (then as yet hath been
applyed) to raiſe the whole people both in the City of <hi>London</hi> and all other parts of the Kingdome. And for the more ſpeedy effecting thereof.</p>
            <p>That you would be pleaſed to ordaine a Committee of ſuch worthy members of this Honourable Houſe as are here expreſſed, who we hope

and any other neceſſary Proviſion for ſtrength and maintenance of an Army: And to compell all ſorts of men that ſhall by them be thought fit,
(though unwilling) to contribute Monies, Horſes, Armes and other neceſſaries as ſhall to them ſeeme juſt and reaſonable: And to engage the
publique Faith for ſatisfaction of whatſoever they ſhall receive for the publique ſervice. To call unto them for their aſſiſtance, and to make
Sub-Committees of ſuch perſons as themſelves ſhall approve of, and to put in execution whatſoever ſhall be neceſſary for this Service. That

cheerefulneſſe and vigour to joyne themſelves with us for the ſpeedy ending this diſtructive Warre. We moſt earneſtly pray you according to
