         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the Bar, ſtands indicted for High Treaſon, and the Indictment
ſets forth, that the ſaid <hi>Edward Coleman,</hi> indeavouring to ſubvert
the Proteſtant Religion, and to change and alter the ſame;
And likewiſe to ſtir up Rebellion and Sedition amongſt the
Kings Liege people, and alſo to kill the King; did on the
29th. of <hi>September</hi> in the twenty ſeventh year of the Reign of
our Sovereign Lord the King, at the Pariſh of St. <hi>Margarets
VVestminſter</hi> in this County, compoſe and write two ſeveral
Letters to one Mounſieur <hi>Le Cheſe,</hi> that was then ſervant and
Confeſſor to the French King, and this was to procure the
French Kings aid and aſſiſtance to him and other Traitors, to
alter the Religion practiſed, and by Law eſtabliſhed here in
<hi>England,</hi> to the Romiſh Superſtition. The Indictment ſets
forth likewiſe, that on the ſame day, he did write and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
two other Letters to the ſame Gentleman, that was ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
and Confeſſor to the ſaid King, to prevail with him to
procure the French Kings aſſiſtance to alter the Religion in this
Kingdome eſtabliſhed to the Romiſh Religion. The Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſets further forth, that he cauſed theſe two Letters to be
ſent beyond the <hi>Seas.</hi> And it alſo ſets forth that on the tenth
of <hi>December,</hi> the ſame moneth he did receive a Letter from the
Gentleman, that was the Confeſſor, in anſwer to one of the
former Letters, and in that Letter aid and aſſiſtance from the
French King was promiſed; and that he did traiterouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
that Letter. My Lord, the Indictment ſets out further, that
on the tenth day of the ſame moneth, he did reveal his Treaſons
and traiterous Conſpiracies to one Mounſieur <hi>Revigni,</hi> who
was Envoy from the French king to his Majeſty of <hi>Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi>
And his Indictment declares, he afterwards did write three
Letters more to Sir <hi>VVilliam Throckmorton,</hi> then reſiding in <hi>France,</hi>
to procure the French Kings aſſiſtance to the alteration of the
Religion practiſed here in <hi>England.</hi> Of theſe ſeveral Offences he
ſtands hereindicted.</p>
               <p>To this he hath pleaded not guilty. If we prove theſe,
or either of them in the Indictment, you ought to find him
guilty.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
of the Jury; This is a Cauſe of great Concernment.
Gentlemen, the Priſoner at the Bar ſtands indicted for no leſs
than for an intention and endeavour to murther the King;
For an endeavour and attempt to change the Government of
the Nation, ſo well ſettled and inſtituted, and to bring us all
to ruin and ſlaughter of one another, and for an endeavour to
alter the Proteſtant Religion, and to introduce inſtead of it, the
Romiſh Superſtition, and Popery.</p>
               <p>This is the Charge (in general) of the Indictment. We
will proceed unto particulars, whereby it may appear, and
whereupon he indeavoureth to accompliſh his ends. One or
two Letters written to Mounſieur <hi>Le Cheſe</hi> (he is a Foreigner,
and we have nothing to ſay to him, being Confeſſor to the
French King) it was to excite and ſtir him up to procure aid
and aſſiſtance (and you know what aid and aſſiſtance means)
from a Foreign Prince, Arms, and other Levies. We charge
him with it, that he did receive this Letter, I and received an
anſwer with a promiſe, that he ſhould have aſſiſtance. He
writ other Letters to Sir <hi>William Throckmorton,</hi> who trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
conſpired with him, and had intelligence from time to
time from him. This is the Charge in the Indictment; To
which he hath pleaded, not guilty. We will go on in our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence:
I ſhall, but more generally, open our method, that
we intend to take. For it may ſeem ſtrange, and is not reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
to be imagined, that a private Gentleman, as the Priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
at the Bar is, ſhould have ſuch vaſt and great deſigns as
this, to alter Religion, deſtroy the Government, I, and deſtroy
the Subjects too in a great meaſure. But 'tis not himſelf alone,
but he imploys himſelf for Forreign aſſiſtance, great Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies
and Combinations with the Subjects of that King, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of whom he did pervert.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of the Evidence I ſhall not open the particulars,
(Mr. Attorney, I think, will do that by and by) thoſe that we
have occaſion to ſpeak of, and ſhall in proof mention to you,
will be theſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Le Cheſe,</hi> the French Kings preſent Confeſſor we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned:
before him there was one Father <hi>Ferryer,</hi> with whom
he held Correſpondence. That <hi>Ferryer</hi> being removed by death,
the Priſoner had an imployment here amongſt us, by which he
gave to <hi>Le Cheſe</hi> inſtructions how to proceed. This Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is the great Contriver and Plotter, which gives him inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58185:6"/>
how to proceed. He doth give him an account by way of
Narrative, how all things had ſtood upon former treaties and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiations,
how buſineſſes were contrived, and how far they
were gone; this he diligently and accurately gives an account
of. This (my Lord) doth diſcover and delineate what had been
done before until 1674. My Lord, there was likewiſe Sir <hi>William
Throckmorton</hi> and ſome others, that are Engliſhmen too, there are
none of them, but what were firſt Proteſtants, but when they
once renounced their Religion, no wonder they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
their Nation, and their Prince too. He was gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Seas, ſeveral Letters paſt between them, and all to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
and encourage, and accompliſh this deſign. My Lord,
there is likewiſe a conſult of Jeſuits uſed too, where, in expreſs
words they deſigned to murther the King, or contrived, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
upon it.</p>
               <p>My Lord, there were four Iriſh men (I open but the heads
of things) ſent to <hi>Windſor</hi> to murther the King, this Gentleman
received and disburſed money about this buſineſs, and one <hi>Aſhby</hi>
a Jeſuit here had inſtructions from him to proſecute the deſign,
and to treat with a Phyſitian to poyſon the King, This the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
approved of, and contributed to it. There were Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
(as I take it) delivered from <hi>Ferryer;</hi> or by his hand, that
came from Forreign powers. Sir <hi>Henry Titchburn</hi> was another
that received and delivered Commisſions. <hi>Pompone</hi> the French
Gentleman, he maintains intelligence with him about this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
the Titular Arch-biſhop of <hi>Dublin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There's Cardinal <hi>Norfolk,</hi> by him he had accesſion to the Pope.</p>
               <p>There was likewiſe the Popes <hi>Nuncio</hi> (I do not open the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
of theſe Iuſtructions) theſe particulars will be made out,
not only by Witneſs <hi>Viva Voce,</hi> and not ſingle only, but by Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of this Mr. <hi>Colemans</hi> own writing. But I offer that to the
conſideration of the Jury.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> was the firſt Man, that we hear of, that diſcovered this
Treaſon; he was the ſingle man that diſcovered ſo many active
Agents in ſo great a Treaſon, as this was, and it needed to be well
ſeconded, but, he being found to be but ſingle, the boldneſs
and courage of theſe Complotters in it grew great thereupon.
We know what followed; the damnable murther of that
Gentleman, in Execution of his Office, ſo Helliſhly contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and the endeavours that were uſed to hide it, every body
knows: How many Stories were told to hide that abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
Murther, how many lies there were about it, but it could
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58185:6"/>
not be ſuppreſt. The Nation is awaken'd out of ſleep, and it
concerns us now to look about us. But all this while, Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
thought himſelf ſafe, walked in the Fields, goes abroad,
Jealouſie increaſing, and he himſelf ſtill ſecure.</p>
               <p>The Letters that are produced go but to ſome part of the
year 75: from 75 unto 78 all lies in the dark, we have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Proof of it; but we apprehend he had Intelligence until
78; That there were the ſame perſons continuing here, and
his Company increaſing here: But this I ſpeak but as probable,
(but very exceeding probable) that there was other paſſages of
Intelligence between this Perſon and other Confederates.</p>
               <p>It ſeems (my Lord) that this <hi>Coleman</hi> was aware that he was
concerned; but God blinded and infatuated him, and took
away his reaſon. It's no queſtion but he carried away ſome
of thoſe Papers; thoſe that were left behind, and are produced,
he forgot and neglected; and by that (my Lord) thoſe which
are produced, are evidence againſt him at this time. Surely he
thought we were in ſuch a condition, that had eyes and could
not ſee, and ears that could not hear, and underſtandings with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
underſtanding: for he was bold, and walked abroad, and
that until this proſecution was made upon him, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to murther the King, change the Government, make
an alteration of Religion, and deſtruction of Proteſtants, as well
as the Proteſtant Religion; And it will be proved by ſome Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
when they were rejected by the Duke, that he ſent them in
the Dukes name. And by this no man will doubt but he is a
great Traitor.</p>

               <p>May it pleaſe your Lordſhip, and you Gentlemen
of the Jury, The Kings Serjeant hath opened the general parts
of our Evidence; and we have reaſon to foreſee that our Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
will be very long, and will take up much of your time;
and therefore I ſhall ſpend no more time in opening of it than
is juſt neceſſary. And indeed (my Lord) Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> himſelf
hath ſaved me much of the labour, which otherwiſe I ſhould
have beſtowed; for he hath left ſuch Elegant and copious Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives
of the whole Deſign under his own hand, that the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of them will be better than any new one I can make.</p>
               <p>But (my Lord) ſome ſhort account I ſhall give you, ſuch as
may ſhew you the courſe of our Evidence, and will make our
Evidence, when it comes to be given, to be more intelligible.</p>
               <p>My Lord, It will appear, that there hath been for many years
laſt paſt, a more than ordinary deſign and induſtry to bring in
the Popiſh, and extirpate the Proteſtant Religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:58185:7"/>
I doubt not but this Deſign, in ſome meaſure, hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving
ever ſince the Reformation, by the Jeſuits, or ſome of
their Emiſſaries, but hath often received interruption; ſo that
they have proceeded ſometimes more coldly, ſometimes more
hotly: And I do think, at no time ſince the Reformation, that
ever this Deſign was carried on with greater induſtry, nor with
fairer hopes of ſucceſs, than for theſe laſt years.</p>
               <p>My Lord, You will hear from our Witneſſes, that the firſt On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,
which was to be made upon us, was by whole Troops of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits
and Prieſts, who were ſent hither from the Seminaries
abroad, where they had been trained up in all the ſubtilty and
skill that was fit to work upon the People.</p>
               <p>My Lord, you will hear how active they have been, and what
inſinuations they uſed for the perverting of particular perſons. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſome time ſpent in ſuch attempts, they quickly grew weary of
that courſe; though they got ſome Proſelytes, they were but
few. Some Bodies, in whom there was a prediſpoſition of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors,
were infected, but their Numbers were not great. They
at laſt reſolve to take a more expeditious way; for in truth,
(my Lord) they could not far prevail by the former. And I wiſh
with all my heart, that the Bodies of Proteſtants may be as much
out of danger of the violence of their hands, as their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings
will be of the force of their Arguments. But (my
Lord) when this way would not take, they began then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
they muſt throw at all at once. No doubt but they would
have been glad, that the People of <hi>England</hi> had had but one
Neck; but they knew the People of <hi>England</hi> had but one
Head, and therefore they were reſolved to ſtrike at that.</p>
               <p>My Lord, you will find, that there was a Summons of the
principal Jeſuits, of the moſt able Head-pieces, who were to
meet in <hi>April</hi> or <hi>May</hi> laſt, to conſult of very great things, of a
moſt Diabolical Nature, no leſs than how to take away the life
of the King our Sovereign</p>
               <p>My Lord, you will find (as is uſually practiſed in ſuch horrid
Conſpiracies) to make all ſecure, that there was an Oath of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſie
taken, and that upon the Sacrament. You will find Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
made, that this moſt wicked and horrible Deſign ſhould
be attempted. You will find two Villains were found among
them, who undertook to do this execrable work; and you
will hear of the rewards they were to have: Money in caſe they
did ſucceed, and Maſſes good ſtore in caſe they periſhed; ſo that
their Bodies were provided for in caſe they ſurvived, and their
Souls if they died. My Lord, What was the reaſon they did not
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:58185:7"/>
effect their Deſign, but either that theſe Villains wanted op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
or their hearts failed them, when they came to put in
execution this wicked Deſign; or, perhaps (which is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable)
it was the Providence of God, which over-rul'd them, that
this bloody Deſign did not take its effect.</p>
               <p>But theſe Gentlemen were not content with one Eſſay, they
quickly thought of another; and there were four <hi>Iriſh-men</hi>
prepared (men of very mean Fortunes, and deſperate conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
and they were to make the attempt no longer ſince, than
when the King was laſt at <hi>Windſor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Lord, I perceive by the Proofs, that theſe laſt Aſſaſſinates
went down thither; but it came to paſs (for ſome of the Reaſons
aforeſaid) that that Attempt failed likewiſe.</p>
               <p>My Lord, Theſe Gentlemen, thoſe wiſe Heads, who had met
here in Conſultation, did then, and long before, conſider with
themſelves, that ſo great a Cauſe as this, was not to be put upon
the hazard of ſome few hands; they therefore prepared Forces,
Aids, and Aſſiſtances, both at home and abroad, to ſecond this
wicked Deſign; if it had ſucceeded as to the Perſon of the King,
and if that fail'd, then by their Foreign and Domeſtick Aids and
Aſſiſtances, to begin and accompliſh the whole Work of ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Government and Religion. And here we muſt needs
confeſs, as to the former part of this Plot, which we have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned,
I mean the attempt upon the Kings Perſon, <hi>Mr.Coleman</hi>
was not the Contriver, nor to be the Executioner; But yet your
Lordſhip knows, in all Treaſons there is no Acceſſory, but every
man is a Principal. And thus much we have againſt him, even
as to this part of the Deſign, which will involve him in the
whole guilt of it, that Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> conſented to it, though his
hand were not to do it. Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> encouraged a Meſſenger
to carry Money down as a Reward of theſe Murtherers, that
were at <hi>Windſor;</hi> of this we have proof againſt him, which is
ſufficient. My Lord, Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> as a man of greater abilities,
is reſerved for greater Employments, and ſuch wherein, I confeſs,
all his Abilities were little enough. There were Negotiations to
be made with Men abroad, Money to be procured, partly at
home from Friends here, and partly abroad from thoſe, that
wiſh'd them well: And in all theſe Negotiations Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> had
a mighty hand; and you will perceive by and by what a great
progreſs he made in them. This Conſpiracy went ſo far, as you
will hear it proved, That there were General Officers named and
appointed, that ſhould Command their new Catholick Army,
and many were Engaged, if not Liſted. There were not onely
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:58185:8"/>
in <hi>England,</hi> but in <hi>Ireland</hi> likewiſe, where Arms and all other
Neceſſaries were provided, and whither great Sums of Money
were returned to ſerve upon occaſion. But one thing there is, my
Lord, that comes neareſt Mr. <hi>Coleman;</hi> As there were Military
Officers named, ſo likewiſe the great Civil Places and Offices of
the Kingdom were to be diſpoſed of; I will not nameto whom
at this time, more than what is pertinent to the preſent buſineſs.</p>
               <p>This Gentleman, ſuch were his great Abilities, the truſt and
reliance that his Party had upon him, that no leſs an Office
would ſerve his turn than that of Principal Secretary of State;
and he had a Commiſſion, that came to him from the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
of the Jeſuits, to enable him to execute that great Office.
My Lord, it ſeems ſtrange, that ſo great an Office ſhould be
conferred by no greater a man than the Superior of the Jeſuits.
But if the Pope can depoſe Kings, and diſpoſe of Kingdoms, no
wonder if the Superior of the Jeſuits can, by a Power delegated
from him, make Secretaries. It is not certain what the Date of
this Commiſſion was, nor the very time when he received it:
but I believe he was ſo earneſt and forward in this Plot, that he
began to execute his Office long before he had his Commiſſion
for it; for I find by his Letters, which are of a more early Date,
that he had proceeded ſo far as to treat with Father <hi>Ferrier,</hi>
who was the <hi>French</hi> Kings Confeſſor, before he had actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
this Commiſſion. You will underſtand by the Letters,
which we ſhall produce, what he had to do with him, and what
with the other Confeſſor, that ſucceeded Father <hi>Le Cheſe.</hi> There
were two ſmall matters they treated of, no leſs than the Diſſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Parliament, and the Extirpation of the Proteſtant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.
Nay, you will find, and you will hear enough, when the
Letters come to be read, that Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> made many ſtrokes
at the Parliament, he had no good opinion of them. And we
cannot blame him; for without all peradventure they had made,
and I hope ever will, make ſtrong reſiſtance againſt ſuch Deſigns
as theſe. But a great mind he had to be rid of them; and he had
hopes of great Sums of Money from abroad, if it had been to
be done that way. And it is very remarkable (and ſhews the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of the Man) he had ſuch an opinion of the ſucceſs of theſe
Negotiations, that he had penn'd a Declaration prepared by
him, and writ with his own hand, to be publiſhed in Print, up
on the Diſſolution of the Parliament, to juſtifie that Action with
many ſpecious and plauſible Reaſons. As he did this without
any direction, ſo he takes upon him to write a Declaration, as in
the Name of the King, without the leaſt ſhadow of any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58185:8"/>
to do it, ſo he prepares a Letter alſo in the name of the
Duke; and I would not affirm, unleſs I could prove it, and that
from his own Confeſſion, (being examined before the Lords
upon Oath) that he had no manner of Authority from the
Duke to prepare ſuch a Letter; and when it was written, and
brought to the Duke, it was rejected, and the Writer juſtly bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
for his preſumption. By this you will perceive the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of this Man. And you muſt of neceſſity take notice, that in
his Letters he took upon himſelf to manage Affairs, as authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
by the greateſt Perſons in the Kingdom, yet without the leaſt
ſhadow of proof that he was by them impowered to do it.</p>
               <p>My Lord, you ſhall find, Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> thought himſelf above
all; and ſuch was his own over-weening opinion of his Wit and
Policy, that he thought himſelf the ſole and ſupreme Director
of all the Affairs of the Catholicks. You will likewiſe perceive
that he held Intelligence with Cardinal <hi>Norfolk,</hi> with Father <hi>Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi>
and the Popes Internuntio at <hi>Bruſſels.</hi> And I cannot but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
out of the Proofs, that as we ſhall find Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> very
ambitious and forward in all great Affairs, ſo he had a little too
much Eye to the Reward; he looked too much aſquint upon
the matter of Money: his great endeavours were not ſo much
out of Conſcience, or out of Zeal to his Religion, as out of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Intereſt; to him Gain was inſtead of Godlineſs. And by
his Letters to the <hi>French</hi> Confeſſor Monſieur <hi>Le Cheſe,</hi> it will be
proved, that he got much Money from the Catholicks here, and
ſome from abroad, but ſtill he wanted Money. What to do? (I
do not mean the greater ſum of two hundred thouſand pounds
to procure the Diſſolution of the Parliament, but ſome twenty
thouſand pounds onely) To be expended by him in ſecret Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
I do not know what account he would have given of it, if
he had been intruſted with it. But that he earneſtly thirſted after
Money, appeareth by moſt of his Letters.</p>
               <p>My Lord, you will obſerve, beſides his Intelligences, that he
had with Father <hi>Le Cheſe,</hi> and ſeveral others, one that deſerves
to be named, and that is his Negotiation with Sir <hi>William Frog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton,</hi>
who was ſent over into <hi>France,</hi> and there reſided a long
time to promote theſe Deſigns. He is dead; therefore I will not
ſay ſo much of him, as I would ſay againſt him, if he was here
to be tri'd. But, my Lord, I find in his Letters ſuch Treaſonable,
ſuch Impious expreſſions againſt the King, ſuch undutiful Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of him, that no good Subject would write, and no good
Subject would receive and conceal, as Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> hath done.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58185:9"/>
My Lord, it may paſs for a wonder, how we come to be Maſters
of all theſe Papers; it has in part been told you already.</p>
               <p>There was an information given of the general Deſign, nay of
ſome of the particulars againſt the Kings Life. And without all
peradventure, Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> knew of this Diſcovery; and he
knew that he had Papers, that could ſpeak too much, and he had
time and opportunity enough to have made them away, and I
make no queſtion, but he did make many away. We are not
able to prove the continuance of his correſpondence, ſo as to
make it clearly out; but we ſuppoſe that continued until the
day he was ſeized. And there is this to be proved, that Letters
came for him, though we cannot ſay any were delivered to him,
after he was in Priſon. But without all peradventure, the Man
had too much to do, too many Papers to conceal: Then, you'll
ſay, he might have burnt them all, (for many would burn as well
as a few:) But then he had loſt much of the Honour of a great
States-man; many a fine Sentence, and many a deep Intrigue
had been loſt to all Poſterity. I believe that we owe this Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to ſomething of Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Vanity; he would not loſe the
Glory of managing theſe important Negotiations about ſo great
a Deſign: He thought 'twas no ſmall Reputation to be intruſted
with the Secrets of Forreign Miniſters. If this was not his reaſon,
God (I believe) took away from him that clearneſs of Judgment,
and ſtrength of Memory, which he had upon other occaſions.</p>
               <p>My Lord, I ſhall no longer detain you from reading the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
themſelves. But I cannot but account this Kingdom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py,
that theſe Papers are preſerved. For (my Lord) We are to deal
with a ſort of men, that have that prodigious confidence, that
their words and deeds (though proved by never ſo unſuſpected
Teſtimony) they will ſtill deny. But (my Lord) no denial of
this Plot will prevail, for Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> himſelf hath, with his
own hand, recorded this Conſpiracy; and we can prove his
hand, not onely by his own Servants, and Relations, but by his
own Confeſſion. So that (my Lord) I doubt not, that if there be
any of their own Party that hear this Trial, they themſelves
will be ſatisfi'd with the truth of theſe things. And I believe we
have an advantage in this caſe, which they will not allow us, in
another matter; namely, that we ſhall be for this once permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to believe our own Senſes. Our Evidence conſiſteth of two
parts; one is, Witneſſes <hi>Viva voce,</hi> which we deſire (with the
favour of the Court) to begin with; and when that is done, we
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:58185:9"/>
ſhall read ſeveral Letters, or Negotiations, in writing, and ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the whole to your Lordſhips direction.</p>

               <p>I beg leave that a poor ignorant Man, that is ſo heavily

Priſoner, in ſuch a caſe as this is, is not allowed Counſel; but your
Lordſhip is ſuppoſed to be Counſel for him. But I think it very hard
I cannot be admitted Counſel; and I humbly hope your Lordſhip will
not ſuffer me to be loſt by things that my ſelf cannot anſwer. I deny
the Concluſion, but the Premiſſes are too ſtrong and artificial.</p>

prejudices that ſeem to be againſt every man in <hi>England,</hi> that is
confeſs'd to be a Roman Catholick. It is poſſible that a Roman
Catholick may be very innocent of theſe crimes. If one of thoſe
Innocent Roman Catholicks ſhould come to this Bar, he lies under ſuch
diſadvantages already, and his Prejudices ſo greatly byaſſeth humane
Nature, that unleſs your Lordſhip will lean extremely much on

gain credit in this matter: You ſay, that you told all things that
you knew, the Truth, and the whole Truth. Can Mankind be
perſuaded, that you, that had this Negotiation in 74. and 75. left
off juſt then, at that time when your Letters vvere found accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their Dates? Do you believe, there was no Negotiation
after 75. becauſe we have not found them? Have you ſpoke
one vvord to that? Have you confeſſed, or produced thoſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
and Weekly Intelligence? When you anſwer that, you
may have credit; vvithout that, it is impoſſible: For I cannot
give credit to one word you ſay, unleſs you give an account of
the ſubſequent Negotiation.</p>

               <p>After that time (as I ſaid to the Houſe of Commons) I did
give over Correſponding. I did offer to take all Oaths and Teſts in
the World, that I never had one Letter for at leaſt two years; yea,
(that I may keep my ſelf within compaſs) I think it was for three or
four. Now I have acknowledged to the Houſe of Commons, I have had
a curſory Correſpondence, which I never regarded or valued; but
as the Letters came, I burnt them, or made uſe of them as common
Paper. I ſay, that for the general Correſpondence I have had for two
or three years, they have had every one of them Letters, that I know of.</p>

that is done, he ſhall be heard, as long as he pleaſeth, vvithout

               <p>Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> we leave it to your ſelf to
take your own way, and your own method: only this
we ſay, here's a Gentleman ſtands at the Bar for his life;
And on the other ſide, the King is concerned for His
life: you are to ſpeak the truth and the whole truth;
for there is no reaſon in the world that you ſhould adde
any one thing that is falſe. I would not have a tittle added
for any advantage, or conſequences that may fall, when a
man's bloud and life lieth at ſtake: Let him be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by truth: you have taken an Oath, and you being a
Miniſter, know the great regard you ought to have of
the ſacredneſs of an Oath; and that to take a man's life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
by a falſe Oath is murther, I need not teach you
that. But that Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> may be ſatisfied in the Trial,
and all people elſe be ſatisfied, there is nothing required or
expected, but downright plain truth, and without any
arts either to conceal, or expatiate, to make things larger
then in truth they are; he muſt be condemned by plain
Evidence of Fact.</p>

of news which was called Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Letter, and at the

Pray Recommend me to my Kinſman <hi>Playford.</hi> In this
Letter of news there were expreſſions of the King, calling
him Tyrant, and that the Marriage between the Prince of

of the Catholick Religion, and that it ſhould be imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for no other intent and purpoſe but that for which it

thoſe words were not in that Letter, but <hi>Lechees</hi> Letter,
to which this was an Anſwer I ſaw and read: It was dated
the Month of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and as near as I remember there was
this inſtruction in it, That the Ten Thouſand Pound ſhould

In this Month of <hi>Auguſt</hi> there was a Letter writ from

the Pope's Right to the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi> In this
Letter (to mention in ſpecial) there were Four Jeſuits
had contrived to diſpatch the Duke of <hi>Ormond</hi> (theſe
were his words) To find the moſt expedient way for
his death, and <hi>Fogarthy</hi> was to be ſent to do it by Poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
if theſe Four good Fathers did not hit of their

               <p>It was in the Provincials Chamber, which <hi>Aſhby</hi>

               <p>The reaſon is plain, they were then a gathering a
Contribution about the Kingdom, and theſe Inſtructions were
ſent that they might be incouraged, becauſe they ſaw there was
incouragement from beyond Seas to aſſiſt them. And an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
Reaſon was, becauſe now they were aſſured by this their

               <p>Yes, I'le tell your Lordſhip how I was acquainted. I
was in <hi>Spain,</hi> he had there two Sons; to ſhew them ſpecial favour
and kindneſs (being meer ſtrangers at the Colledge) I did uſe to
tranſmit ſome Letters for them to the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> in my
Pacquet. When I came out of <hi>Spain,</hi> I did receive Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
from them to their Father, and in great civility he received
me. This was in <hi>November</hi> that I came to his houſe. He lived in
<hi>Shear-lane</hi> or thereabouts. I underſtood that his Wife was a zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Proteſtant; therefore he deſired me not to come any more to
his houſe, but for the future to come to his Chamber in the <hi>Temple.</hi>
               </p>

               <speaker>Mr. Oates,</speaker>
               <p>I never ſaw him till <hi>Nov.</hi> (77.) to my knowledge.
I was ſeveral times in his company at his chamber, and he brought
me there to ſhew me ſome kindneſs upon the account of his Sons.
It was at the <hi>Temple,</hi> for his Wife being a Proteſtant was not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
any Jeſuits ſhould come to the houſe. I was to carry him a
ſummary of all the reſults and particulars of the Conſult at the
<hi>White Horſe</hi> and <hi>Wild Houſe.</hi> The Provincial ordered me to do it, he
knowing me, being in that affair often imployed.</p>

the Councel, and this man that gives now in Evidence againſt me,
there told the King, he never ſaw me before; and he is extreamly well
acquainted with me now, and hath a World of Intimacy. <hi>Mr. Oates</hi>
at that time gave ſuch an Account of my Concern in this matter, that
I had orders to go to <hi>Newgate,</hi> I never ſaw <hi>Mr. Oates</hi> ſince I was

ſaw him before in my Life: I then ſaid I would not ſwear that I
had ſeen him before in my Life, becauſe my ſight was bad by Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle-light,
and Candle-light alters the ſight much, but when I heard

Evidence when they know it, and bring Perſons to ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,

give in more than a general Information againſt Mr. <hi>Coleman; Mr.
Coleman</hi> did deny he had Correſpondence with Father <hi>Le Cheſe</hi> at

And (my Lord) then was I ſo weak, being up two nights,

ſcarce ſtand upon my Legs.</p>

charge you with all theſe matters of poyſoning and killing
the King, and yet he mentioned you ſo ſlightly at
the Council-Table; but it is ſaid by Sir <hi>Robert Southwell</hi>
he did charge you with five thouſand pounds (for poiſoning
the King) to be added to the ten thouſand pounds, and he
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:58185:19"/>
charged you expreſly with it at the Council Table.</p>

               <p>The Charge was ſo ſlight againſt me by Mr. <hi>Oats,</hi> that
the Council were not of his Opinion: For the firſt order was
to go to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and Sir <hi>Robert Southwell</hi> came with directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to the Meſſenger not to execute the Order. I humbly ask
whether it was a reaſonable thing to conceive that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
ſhould extenuate the puniſhment, if Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> came with
ſuch an amazing account to the Council,</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sir Rob. South.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> gave ſo large and general an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
to the Council, that it could not eaſily be fixed.
Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> came voluntarily in upon Monday morning. The
Warrant was ſent out on Sunday night for Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> and
his Papers: His Papers were found and ſeized; but Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
was not found at that time, nor all Night, but came on
Monday morning voluntarily, and offered himſelf at Sir <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph
Williamſon</hi>'s Houſe, hearing there was a Warrant againſt
him: By reaſon of ſo many Priſoners that were then under
Examination, he was not heard till the Afternoon, and then
he did with great Indignation and Contempt hear theſe vile
things, as thinking himſelf innocent.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> then made ſo good a diſcourſe
for himſelf, that though the Lords had filled up a blank War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
to ſend him to <hi>Newgate,</hi> that was reſpited, and he was
only committed to a Meſſenger. I did ſay to the Meſſenger,
be very civil to Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> for things are under Examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but you muſt keep him ſafely. Saith the Meſſenger,
pray let me have a ſpecial Warrant, that doth diſpence with
the Warrant I had to carry him to <hi>Newgate,</hi> and ſuch a
Warrant he had. The King went away on Tueſday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to <hi>Newmarket,</hi> and appointed a particular Committee to
examine the Papers brought of Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> and others.</p>
               <p>His Papers were found in a Deal box, and ſeveral of theſe
Papers and Declarations ſounded ſo ſtrangely to the Lords,
that they were amazed; and preſently they ſigned a War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
for Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s going to <hi>Newgate.</hi>

in the Afternoon on Sunday when the King was preſent,
all he had ſaid to the Lords on Saturday.</p>
               <p>He did ſay of Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> that he had correſponded very
wickedly and baſely with the French King's Confeſſor, and
did believe if Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Papers were ſearched, there
would be found in them that which would coſt him his Neck.
And did declare that the fifteen thouſand pounds was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
for the murther of the King, and that five thouſand
pounds was actually paid by Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> to Sir <hi>George Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
But Mr. <hi>Oats</hi> at the ſame time did alſo declare that he
did not ſee the mony paid, he did not ſee this particular acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

               <p>It appears plainly by this Teſtimony, that he
did charge you Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> home, that fifteen thouſand

was generally ſaid among them (though he did not
ſee it paid) that it came by your hands, <hi>viz.</hi> five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand

had not charged you, when you ſee he did charge you home

               <p>Yes, and <hi>Harcourt</hi> delivered it to me to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <p>They told me how much reward I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
from the Pope and the Church, both here, and in
the world to come. <hi>I</hi> overtook three, and that night I
went to <hi>Paris</hi> with them; and upon the Conſultation
(1677) I believe they ſent the Biſhop of <hi>Tornes</hi> the
ſubſtance of thoſe Letters, and not having a final anſwer
what aſſiſtance the Catholick Party in <hi>England</hi> might expect
from them, they were reſolved to neglect their deſign no

in <hi>England.</hi>

               <p>That he would adventure any thing to bring in
the Popiſh Religion: After the Conſultation, I delivered the
Letters to <hi>le Faire,</hi> and he brought them to <hi>Harcourt,</hi> he
delivered the Packet of Letters to <hi>Harcourt,</hi> who was not
well, but yet went and delivered them to Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi>
and I went as far as Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi>'s Houſe, but did not go
in, but ſtayed over the way; but <hi>Harcourt</hi> went in, and
after he had ſpoke with Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> he gave me a beck to
come to him; and I heard Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> ſay, if he had a hundred
lives, and a Sea of Blood to carry on the Cauſe, he would
ſpend it all to further the Cauſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
and to eſtabliſh the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>England:</hi> and if

Said he, thoſe that are in the large ſpeckled cloath Bagg;

                  <p>SInce Father St. <hi>German</hi> has been ſo kind to me, as to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend

you to accept of my Correſpondency; I will own to
him, that he has done me a Favour without Conſulting me,
greater than I could have been capable of if he had adviſed with
me; becauſe I could not then have had the Confidence to have
permitted him to ask it on my behalf. And I am ſo ſenſible of
the Honour you are pleaſed to do me, that though I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it; yet to ſhew at leaſt the ſenſe I have of it, I will deal as
freely and openly with you this firſt time, as if I had had the
honour of your Acquaintance all my life; and ſhall make no
Apology for ſo doing, but only tell you that I know your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
perfectly well, though I am not ſo happy as to know your
Perſon; and that I have an Opportunity of putting this Letter
into the hands of Father St. <hi>German</hi>

                     </gap>s Nephew (for whoſe Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
and Prudence he has undertaken) without any ſort of
hazard.</p>
                  <p>In order then Sir to the plainneſs I profeſs, I will tell you
what has formerly paſſed between your Reverence's Predeceſſor,
Father <hi>Ferryer</hi> and my ſelf. About three years ago, when the
King my Maſter ſent a Troop of Horſe Guards into his moſt
Chriſtian Majeſties Service, under the Command of my Lord
<hi>Duraſs;</hi> he ſent with it an Officer called Sir <hi>William Throckmorton,</hi>
with whom I had a particular Intimacy, and who had then very
newly embrac'd the Catholick Religion: To him did I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
Write, and by him addreſs my ſelf to Father <hi>Ferryer.</hi> The
firſt thing of great Importance I preſumed to offer him (not to
trouble you with leſſer matters, or what paſſed here before, and
immediatly after the Fatal Revocation of the Kings Declaration
for Liberty of Conſcience, (to which we owe all our Miſeries
and hazards,) was in <hi>July, Auguſt,</hi> and <hi>September</hi> 1673. when
I conſtantly inculcated the great danger Catholick Religion, and
his moſt Chriſtian Majeſties Intereſt would be in at our next
Seſſions of Parliament, which was then to be in <hi>October</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
at which I plainly foreſaw that the King my Maſter would
be forced to ſomething in prejudice to his Allyance with <hi>France,</hi>
which I ſaw ſo evidently and particularly that we ſhould make
Peace with <hi>Holland,</hi> that I urg'd all the Arguments I could, which
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:58185:24"/>
to me were Demonſtrations, to convince your Court of that miſchief;
and preſs'd all I could to perſwade his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty to uſe
his utmoſt endeavour to prevent that seſſion of our Parliament, and
propoſed Expedients how to do it: But I was anſwered ſo often and
ſo poſitively, that his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty was ſo vvell aſſured by
his Embaſſador here, our Embaſſador there, the Lord <hi>Arlington,</hi>
and even the King himſelf; that he had no ſuch apprehenſions at all,
but vvas fully ſatisfied of the contrary, and lookt upon what I
offered as a very zealous miſtake, that I was forced to give over ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing,
though not believing as I did; but confidently appealed to
time and ſucceſs to prove who took their meaſures righteſt. When
it happened what I foreſaw came to paſs, the good Father was
a little ſurprized, to ſee all the great men miſtaken, and a little one
in the right; and was pleaſed by Sir <hi>William Throckmorton</hi> to deſire
the continuance of my correſpondence, which I was mighty willing
to comply with, knowing the Intereſt of our King, and in a more
particular manner of my more immediate Maſter the Duke, and his
moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, to be ſo inſeparably united, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
to divide them, without deſtroying them all: Upon this I
ſhewed that our Parliament in the circumſtances it was managed,
by the timerous Councels of our Miniſters, who then governed,
would never be uſeful either to <hi>England, France,</hi> or Catholick Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
but that we ſhould as certainly be forced from our Neutrality
at their next meeting, as we had been from our Active Alliance with
<hi>France</hi> the laſt year: That a Peace in the Circumſtances we were in,
was much more to be deſired then the continuance of the War; and
that the Diſſolution of our Parliament would certainly procure a
Peace; for that the Confederates did more depend upon the power
they had in our Parliament, then upon any thing elſe in the World;
and were more encouraged from them to the continuing of the War;
ſo that if they were Diſſolved, their meaſures would be all broken,
and they conſequently in a manner neceſſitated to a Peace.</p>
                  <p>The good Father minding this Diſcourſe ſomewhat more then the
Court of <hi>France</hi> thought fit to do my former; urg'd it ſo home to
the King, that his Majeſty was pleaſed to give him Orders to ſignify
to his R. H. my Maſter, that his Majeſty vvas fully ſatisfyed of his
R. H<hi rend="sup">s.</hi> good intention tovvards him, and that he eſteemed both their
intereſts but as one and the ſame; that my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> and the
Parliament were both to be lookt upon as very unuſeful to their inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt:
That if his R. H. would endeavour to diſſolve this Parliament, his
moſt Chriſtian Majeſty would aſſiſt him with his Povver and Purſe,
to have a nevv one as ſhould be for their purpoſe. This, and a
great many more expreſſions of kindneſs and confidence Father
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:58185:25"/>
                     <hi>Ferryer</hi> was pleaſed to communicate to Sir <hi>William Throckmorton,</hi> and
Commanded them to ſend them to his R. H. and withall to beg his
R. H. to propoſe to his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, what he thought
neceſſary for his own concern, and the advantage of Religion, and
his Majeſty would certainly do all he could to advance both or either
of them. This Sir <hi>William Throckmorton</hi> ſent to me by an Expreſs,
who left <hi>Paris</hi> the <hi>2d</hi> of <hi>June 1674 Stilo novo:</hi> I no ſooner had
it, but I communicated it to his R. H. To which his R. H. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
me to anſwer, as I did on the <hi>29th.</hi> of the ſame month:
That his R. H. was very ſenſible of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſties
friendſhip, and that he would labour to cultivate it with all the good
Offices he was capable of doing for his Majeſty; that he was fully
convinced that their Intereſts were both one that my Lord <hi>Arlington</hi>
and the Parliament vvere not only unuſeful, but very dangerous both
to <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France;</hi> That therefore it was neceſſary that they
ſhould do all they could to Diſſolve it. And that his R. H's. opinion
was, that if his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty would Write his thoughts
freely to the King of <hi>England</hi> upon this Subject, and make the ſame
proffer to his Majeſty of his Purſe to Diſſolve this Parliament, which
he had made to his R H. to call another, he did believe it very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
for him to ſucceed with the aſſiſtance we ſhould be able to give
him here; and that if this Parliament were Diſſolved, there would
be no great difficulty of getting a new one, which would be more
uſeful: The Conſtitutions of our Parliaments being ſuch, that a
new one can never hurt the Crown, nor an old one do it good.</p>
                  <p>His R. H. being pleaſed to own theſe Propoſitions, which were but
only general, I thought it reaſonable to be more particular, and
come cloſer to the point, we might go the faſter about the work,
and come to ſome iſſue before the time was too far ſpent.</p>
                  <p>I laid this for my Maxim: The Diſſolution of our Parliament
will certainly procure a Peace; which propoſition was granted by
every body I Converſed withall, even by Monſieur <hi>Rouvigny</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
with whom I took liberty of diſcourſing ſo far, but durſt not
ſay any thing of the Intelligence I had with Father <hi>Ferryer.</hi> Next;
that a Sum of Money certain, would certainly procure a Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
this ſome doubted, but I am ſure I never did; for I knew per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
well that the King had frequent Diſputes with himſelf at that
time, whether he ſhould diſſolve or continue them; and he ſeveral
times declared that the Arguments were ſo ſtrong on both ſides,
that he could not tell to which to incline, but was carried at laſt to
the continuance of them by this one Argument: If I try them once
more, they may poſſibly give me Money; if they do, I have gain'd
my point: if they do not, I can diſſolve them then, and be where
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:58185:25"/>
I am now; ſo that I have a poſſibility at leaſt of getting Money for
their Continuance, againſt nothing on the other ſide: But if we
could have turn'd this Argument, and ſaid; Sir, their Diſſolution will
certainly procure you Money, when you have only a bare poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of getting any by their Continuance, and have ſhewn how far
that bare poſſibility was from being a foundation to build any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
hope upon, which <hi>I</hi> am ſure his Majeſty was ſenſible of; and
how much <hi>300000l. ſterl.</hi> certain (which was the ſum we propos'd)
was better than a bare poſſibility (without any reaſon to hope that
that could ever be compaſſed) of having half ſo much more (which
was the moſt he deſign'd to ask) upon ſome vile diſhonourable terms;
and a thouſand other hazards, which he had great reaſon to be afraid
of: If I ſay we had had power to have argued this, I am moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently
aſſured we could have compaſſed it, for Logick in our
Court built upon Money, has more powerful Charms, then any
other ſort of reaſoning. But to ſecure his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty
from any hazard, as to that point I propos'd his Majeſty ſhould offer
that ſum upon that condition, and if the condition were not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
the Money ſhould never be due; if it were, and that a Peace
would certainly follow thereupon, (which no body doubted) his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
would gain his Ends, and ſave all the vaſt expences of the next

the <hi>15th.</hi> of <hi>September</hi> 1674. and ſent his Letter by Sir <hi>William
Throckmorton,</hi> who came expreſs upon that Errand; In theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
he gave his R. H. freſh aſſurance of his moſt Chriſtian Majeſties
friendſhip, and of his Zeal and Readineſs to comply with every
thing His R. H. had, or ſhould think fit to propoſe in favour of
<hi>Religion,</hi> or the buſineſs of <hi>Money;</hi> And that he had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Monſieur Rouvigny</hi> as to the latter, to Treat and deal with his
R. H. and to receive and obſerve his Orders and Directions, but
deſired that he might not at all be concerned as to the former, but
that his R. H. would cauſe what Propoſition he ſhould think fit to
be made about Religion, to be offered either to Father <hi>Ferryer,</hi> or
Monſieur <hi>Pompone.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Letters came to us about the middle of <hi>September,</hi> and his
R. H. expected daily when Monſieur <hi>Rouvigny</hi> ſhould ſpeak to him
about the Subject of that Letter; but he took no notice at all of any
thing till the <hi>29th.</hi> of <hi>September,</hi> the evening before the King and
Duke went to <hi>Newmarket</hi> for a fortnight, and then only ſaid, that he
had Commands from his Maſter to give his R. H. the moſt firm aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of his Friendſhip imaginable, or ſomething to that purpoſe,
making his R. H. a general Complement, but made no mention of
any particular Orders relating to Father <hi>Ferryer's</hi> Letter. The Duke
wondering at this proceeding, and being obliged to ſtay a good part
of <hi>October</hi> at <hi>Newmarket;</hi> and ſoon after his coming back-hearing
of the Death of Father <hi>Ferryer,</hi> he gave over all further proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of the former Project. But I believe I ſaw Monſieur <hi>Rouvigny</hi>'s
policy all along, who was vvilling to ſave his Maſters Money, upon
aſſurance that we would do all we could to ſtave off the Parliament
for our own ſakes, that we would ſtruggle as hard vvithout money
as with it; and vve having by that time, upon our ovvn Intereſt,
prevailed to get the Parliament Prorogued to the 13th. of <hi>April,</hi>
he thought that Prorogation being to a day ſo high in the Spring,
vvould put the Confederates ſo far beyond their Meaſures, as that
it might procure a Peace, and be as uſeful to <hi>France,</hi> as a Diſſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
upon theſe Reaſons <hi>I</hi> ſuppoſe he vvent. <hi>I</hi> had ſeveral diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
vvith him; and did open my ſelf ſo far to him as to ſay, <hi>I</hi>
could vviſh his Maſter vvould give us leave to offer to our Maſter
<hi>300000l.</hi> for the Diſſolution of the Parliament; and ſhewed him
that a Peace vvould moſt certainly follow a Diſſolution (which he
agreed with me in) and that vve deſir'd not the Mony from his
Maſter to excite our vvills, or to make us more induſtrious to uſe
our utmoſt povvers to procure a Diſſolution, but to ſtrengthen our
Povver and Credit vvith the King, and to render us more capable to
ſucceed vvith his Majeſty, as moſt certainly vve ſhould have done,
had vve been fortified vvith ſuch an Argument.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="49" facs="tcp:58185:26"/>
To this Purpoſe I preſs'd Mounſieur <hi>Pompone</hi> frequently by Sir
<hi>Will. Throckmorton,</hi> who returned hence again into <hi>France</hi> on the <hi>Tenth</hi>
of <hi>November,</hi> the day our Parliament ſhould have met, but was Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogued.
Mounſieur <hi>Pompone</hi> (as I was informed by Sir <hi>William</hi>) did
ſeem to approve the thing; but yet had Two Objections againſt it:
Firſt, That the Sum we propoſed, was Great; and could be very
ill ſpared in the circumſtances his <hi>Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty</hi> was in. To
which we Anſwer'd, That if by his Expending that Sum, he could
procure a Diſſolution of our Parliament, and thereby a Peace,
which every body agreed would neceſſarily follow; his <hi>Moſt Chriſtian
Majeſty</hi> would gain his Ends, and ſave Five or Ten Times a greater
Sum, and ſo be a good Husband by his Expence; and if we did
not procure a Diſſolution, he ſhould not be at that Expence at all;
for that we Deſired him only to promiſe upon that Condition, which
we were content to be Obliged to perform firſt. The Second Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
was, The Duke did not move, nor appear in it Himſelf.
To that we Anſwered, That he did not indeed to Mounſieur <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone,</hi>
becauſe he had found ſo ill an effect of the Negotiation with Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Ferryer,</hi> when it came into Mounſieur <hi>Rouvigny</hi>'s hands; but that
he had concerned himſelf in it to Father <hi>Ferryer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet I continued to proſecute and preſs the Diſſolution of the
Parliament, deteſting all Prorogations as only ſo much loſs of time,
and a means of ſtrengthning all thoſe who depend upon it in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
to the <hi>Crown,</hi> the Intereſt of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi>
in the Opinion they had taken, That our King durſt not part with
his Parliament; apprehending that another would be much Worſe.
Second, That he could not live long without a Parliament, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they muſt ſuddenly Meet; and the longer he kept them Off,
the greater his Neceſſity would grow; and conſequently their
power to make him do what they liſted, would increaſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly:
And therefore, if they could but maintain themſelves a
while, the day would certainly come in a ſhort time, in which they
ſhould be able to work their Wills. Such Diſcourſes as theſe kept
the <hi>Confederates</hi> and our <hi>Male-Contents</hi> in heart, and made them wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
on the War in ſpight of all our Prorogations: Therefore I
preſs'd (as I have ſaid) a Diſſolution until <hi>February</hi> laſt, when our
<hi>Circumſtances</hi> were ſo totally <hi>Changed,</hi> that we were forced to change
our <hi>Councels</hi> too, and be as much for the Parliaments Sitting, as we
were before againſt it.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Change</hi> was thus; Before that time, the Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> was
the only Miniſter in Credit, who thought himſelf out of all dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:58185:27"/>
of the Parliament; he having been Accuſed before them and
Juſtified, &amp; therefore was Zealous for their ſitting; and to increaſe
his Reputation with them, and to become a perfect Favourite,
he ſets himſelf all he could, to Perſecute the <hi>Catholick</hi> Religion, and
to oppoſe the <hi>French:</hi> To ſhew his Zeal againſt the firſt, he revived
ſome old dormant Orders for prohibiting <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
before the King, and put them in Execution at his firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into his Office of Lord <hi>Chamberlain:</hi> And to make ſure work
with the ſecond, as he thought; prevailed with the King to give
him and the Earl of <hi>Oſſory,</hi> (who married two Siſters of <hi>Myne Heere
Odyke</hi>'s) leave to go over into <hi>Holland</hi> with the ſaid <hi>Heere,</hi> to make
a Viſit, as they pretended, to their Relations; But indeed, and
in truth, to propoſe the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> (Eldeſt Daughter of his
<hi>R. H.</hi>) as a Match for the Prince of <hi>Orange;</hi> not only without
the conſent, but againſt the good likeing of his <hi>R. H.:</hi> in ſo
much, that the Lord <hi>Arlingtons</hi> Creatures were forced to excuſe
him, with a Diſtinction, that the ſaid Lady was not to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon as the Dukes Daughter, but as the Kings, and a
Child of the State was, and ſo the Duke's conſent not much to be
Conſidered in the diſpoſal of her, but only the Intereſt of State.
By this he intended to render himſelf the Darling of Parliament
and Proteſtants, who look'd upon themſelves as ſecured in their
Religion by ſuch an Alliance, and deſigned further to draw us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
a Cloſe Conjunction with <hi>Holland,</hi> and the Enemies of
<hi>France.</hi> The Lord <hi>Arlington</hi> ſet forth upon this Errand the <hi>Tenth</hi> of
<hi>November</hi> 1674. and returned not till the <hi>Sixth</hi> of <hi>January</hi> following;
During his abſence, the L. <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> L. <hi>Keeper,</hi> &amp; the Duke of <hi>Lauder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale,</hi>
who were the only <hi>Miniſters</hi> of any <hi>conſiderable Credit</hi> with the <hi>King,</hi>
and who all pretended to be entirely United to the Duke, declaimed
Loudly, &amp; with great Violence, againſt the ſaid Lord, &amp; his Actions
in <hi>Holland;</hi> and did hope, in his abſence, to have totally Supplanted
him, and to have routed him out of the Kings Favour; and after
that, thought they might eaſily enough have dealt with the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.
But none of them had Courage enough to ſpeak againſt
the Parliament, till they could get rid of him; for fear they ſhould not
ſucceed, and that the Parliament would Sit in ſpight of them, and
come to hear that they had uſed their endeavours againſt it; which
would have been ſo Unpardonable a Crime with our <hi>Omnipotent Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi>
that no Power could have been able to have Saved them from
<hi>Puniſhment:</hi> but they finding at his Return, that they could not prevail
againſt him, by ſuch Means and Arts as they had then tryed, reſolved
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:58185:27"/>
upon <hi>New Councels;</hi> which were to out-run him in his own Courſe;
which accordingly they undertook, &amp; became as fierce Apoſtles, and
as zealous for <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> &amp; againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> as ever my L. <hi>Arlington</hi>
had been before them; and in purſuance thereof, perſwaded the King
to iſſue out thoſe ſevere <hi>Orders</hi> &amp; <hi>Proclamations</hi> againſt <hi>Catholicks,</hi> which
came out in <hi>February</hi> laſt; by which, they did as much as in them lay,
to extirpate all <hi>Catholicks,</hi> and <hi>Catholick Religion,</hi> out of the Kingdom;
which Councels, were in my poor opinion ſo Deteſtable, being level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
(as they muſt needs be) ſo directly againſt the <hi>Duke,</hi> by People
which he had Advanced, and who had profeſſed ſo much Duty and
Service to him, that we were put upon new Thoughts how to ſave
his <hi>R. H.</hi> now from the Deceits and Snares of thoſe men, upon
whom we formerly depended. We ſaw well enough, that their deſign
was to make themſelves as grateful as they could to the Parliament,
if it muſt Sit; they thinking nothing ſo acceptable to them, as the
perſecution of <hi>Popery;</hi> and yet they were ſo obnoxious to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
diſpleaſure in general, that they would have been glad of any
Expedient to have kept it off; though they durſt not engage againſt
it openly themſelves, but thought this Device of theirs might ſerve for
their purpoſes, hoping the <hi>Duke</hi> would be ſo alarm'd at their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
and by his being left by every body, that he would be much more
afraid of the Parliament than ever, and would uſe his utmoſt power
to prevent its Sitting: which they doubted not but he would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour;
&amp; they were ready enough to work underhand too for him (for
their own ſakes, not his) in order thereunto, but durſt not appear o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly;
and to encourage the <hi>Duke</hi> the more to endeavour the <hi>Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of the Parliament, their Creatures uſed to ſay up and down, That
this Rigour againſt the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> was in favour of the <hi>Duke,</hi> and to
make a <hi>Diſſolution</hi> of the Parliament more eaſy, (which they knew he
coveted) by obviating one great <hi>Objection</hi> which was commonly made
againſt it, which was, That if the Parliament ſhould be <hi>Diſſolved,</hi>
it would be ſaid, That it was done in favour of <hi>Popery;</hi> which Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
they had prevented beforehand by the Severity they had uſed
againſt it.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as we ſaw theſe Tricks put upon us, we plainly ſaw
what men we had to deal withal, and what we had to truſt to,
if we were wholly at their mercy: but yet durſt not ſeem ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied
as we really were, but rather magnified the Contrivance,
as a Device of great Cunning and Skill: all this we did, purely
to hold them in a belief, that we would endeavour to Diſſolve the
Parliament, &amp; that they might rely upon his <hi>R. H.</hi> for that which we
knew they long'd for, and were afraid they might do ſome other
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:58185:28"/>
way, if they diſcovered that we were reſolved we would not: At
length, when we ſaw the Seſſions ſecured, we declared, that we
were for the Parliaments meeting; as indeed we were, from the
moment we ſaw our ſelves handled by all the Kings Miniſters at
ſuch a rate, that we had Reaſon to believe, they would Sacrifice
<hi>France, Religion,</hi> and his <hi>R. H.</hi> too, to their own Intereſt, if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
ſerved; and that they were lead to believe, that that was
the only way they had to ſave themſelves at that time: for we
ſaw no Expedient fit to ſtop them in their Carreir of perſecution,
and thoſe other deſtructive Counſels, but the Parliament; which
had ſet it ſelf a long time to diſlike every thing the Miniſters had
done, and had appeared violently againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> whileſt the Court
ſeemed to favor it; and therefore we were Confident, that the
Miniſters having turned their Faces, the Parliament would do ſo
too, and ſtill be againſt them; and be as little for Perſecution
then, as they had been for <hi>Popery</hi> before. This I undertook to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
for the Duke and the King of <hi>France</hi>'s Intereſt; and aſſured
Mounſieur <hi>Rouvigny</hi> (which I am ſure he will teſtify, if occaſion
ſerves) that that Seſſions ſhould do neither of them any hurt; for
that I was ſure I had power enough to prevent miſchief, though
I durſt not engage for any good they vvould do; becauſe I had but
very few aſſiſtances to carry on the vvork, and vvanted thoſe helps,
which others had of making friends: The <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Spaniard</hi> ſpared
no pains or expence of mony to animate as many as they could againſt
<hi>France;</hi> Our Lord <hi>Treaſurer,</hi> Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> all the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> &amp; ſuch as call'd
themſelves <hi>Old Cavaliers,</hi> (who vvere all then as one man) were not leſs
induſtrious againſt <hi>Popery,</hi> and had the Purſe at their Girdle too;
vvhich is an Excellent Inſtrument to gain Friends vvith; and all
United againſt the Duke, as Patron both of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Catholick</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
To deal with all this Force, vve had no Money, but vvhat
came from a few private hands; and thoſe ſo mean ones too, that I
dare venture to ſay, that I ſpent more my particular ſelf out of my
own Fortune, and upon my ſingle Credit, than all the whole Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of <hi>Catholicks</hi> in <hi>England</hi> beſides; which was ſo inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
in compariſon of what our Adverſaries commanded, and we
verily believe did beſtow in making their Party, that it is not worth
mentioning: Yet notwithſtanding all this, we ſaw that by the
help of the Nonconformiſts, as <hi>Presbyterians, Independents,</hi> and other
<hi>Sects,</hi> (who were as much afraid of Perſecution as our ſelves) and
of the Enemies of the Miniſters, and particularly of the <hi>Treaſurer;</hi>
who by that time had ſupplanted the Earl of <hi>Arlington,</hi> and was
grown ſole manager of all Affaires himſelf, we ſhould be very able to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:58185:28"/>
prevent vvhat they deſigned againſt us, and ſo render the Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
ineffectual to their Ends, though vve might not be able to
compaſs our own; which were, to make ſome brisk ſtep in Favour of
his <hi>R. H.</hi> to ſhew the King, that his Majeſties Affairs in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were not Obſtructed, by reaſon of any Averſion they had to
his <hi>R. H</hi>'s Perſon, or apprehenſions they had of him, or his Religion;
But from Faction and Ambition in ſome, and from a real diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction
in others, that we have not had ſuch fruits and good Effects
of thoſe great ſums of Money which have been formerly given as
was expected. If we could then have made but one ſuch ſtep, the
King would certainly have reſtored his <hi>R. H.</hi> to all his Comiſſions;
upon which he would have been much greater than ever yet he
was in his whole Life, or could probably ever have been by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Courſe in the World, than what he had taken of becoming <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique,</hi>
&amp;c. And we were ſo very near gaining this Point, that I did
humbly beg his <hi>R. H.</hi> to give me leave to put the Parliament upon
making an Addreſs to the King, that his Majeſty would be pleaſed
to put the Fleet into the hands of his <hi>R. H.</hi> as the only Perſon like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to give a good Accompt of ſo important a Charge as that was
to the Kingdom; And ſhewed his <hi>R. H.</hi> ſuch Reaſons to perſwade
him that we could carry it, that he agreed with me in it, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd
we could. Yet others telling him how great a Damage it
would be to him, if he ſhould miſs in ſuch an undertaking (which for
my part I could not then ſee, nor do I yet) he was prevailed upon not
to venture, though he was perſwaded he could carry it. I did Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate
this Deſigne of mine to Mounſieur <hi>Rouvigny,</hi> who agreed
with me, that it would be the greateſt advantage immaginable to his
Maſter, to have the <hi>Dukes</hi> Power and Credit ſo far Advanced as this
would certainly do, if we could compaſs it: I ſhewed him all the
Difficulty we were like to meet with, and what helps we ſhould
have; but that we ſhould want one very matterial one, <hi>Money,</hi> to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
on the Work as we ought; and therefore I do Confeſs, I did
ſhamefully beg his Maſters Help, and would willingly have been
in everlaſting Diſgrace with all the World, if I had not with that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of twenty Thouſand Pound <hi>Sterling,</hi> (which perhaps is not
the tenth part of what was ſpent on the other ſide) made it evident
to the <hi>Duke,</hi> that he could not have miſſed it. Mounſieur <hi>Rouvigny</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to tell me, That if he could be ſure of ſucceeding in that Deſign,
his Maſter would give a very much larger Sum; but that he was
not in a Condition to throw away money upon Uncertainties. I An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
That nothing of that nature could be ſo infallibly ſure, as
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:58185:29"/>
not to be ſubject to ſome poſſibilities of Failing; but that I durſt
venture to undertake to make it evident, that there was as great an
aſſurance of ſucceeding in it, as any Husbandman can have of
a Crop in Harveſt, vvho ſovvs his Ground in its due Seaſon;
and yet it vvould be counted a very imprudent peice of vvari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in any body, to ſcruple the venturing ſo much Seed in its
proper time, becauſe it is poſſible it may be totally loſt, and no
benefit of it found in Harveſt; He that mindes the Winds and the
Rains at that rate, ſhall neither Sovv nor Reap. I take our Caſe
to be much the ſame as it was the laſt Seſſions: If we can advance
the <hi>Duke's</hi> Intereſt one ſtep forward, we ſhall put him out of the
reach of Chance for ever; For he makes ſuch a Figure already, that
Cautious Men do not care to Act againſt him, nor always with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
him, becauſe they do not ſee that he is much out-powred by his
Enemies; Yet is he not at ſuch a Pitch, as to be quite out of danger,
or free from oppoſition: But if he could gain any conſiderable new
addition of Power, all would come over to him as to the only ſteddy
Center of our Government, and no body would contend with him
further. Then would <hi>Catholicks</hi> be at Reſt, and his <hi>Moſt Chriſtian Majeſtie</hi>'s
Intereſt ſecured with us in <hi>England,</hi> beyond all apprehenſions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
                  <p>In order to this, we have two great Deſignes to Attempt this
next Seſſions. Firſt, that which we were about before, <hi>viz.</hi> To
put the Parliament upon making it their humble Requeſt to the King,
that the Fleet may be put into his <hi>R. H</hi>'s Care. <hi>Secondly,</hi> to get an Act
for general liberty of Conſcience. If we carry theſe two, or either
of them, we ſhall in effect do what we liſt afterwards; and truly,
we think we do not undertake theſe great Points very unreaſonably,
but that we have good Cards for our Game; Not but that we expect
great Oppoſition, and have great Reaſon to beg all the Aſſiſtance
we can poſſibly get; and therefore, if his <hi>Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty</hi> would
ſtand by us a little in this <hi>Conjuncture,</hi> and help us with ſuch a ſum as
20000. l. <hi>ſterling</hi> (which is no very great matter to venture upon ſuch
an undertaking as this) I would be content to be Sacrificed to the
utmoſt Malice of my Enemies, if I did not Succeed. I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
This ſeveral times to Monſieur <hi>Rouvigny,</hi> who ſeemed always
of my Opinion; and has often told me, that he has writ into
<hi>France</hi> upon this Subject, and has deſired me to do the like: But I
know not whether he will be as Zealous in that point as a <hi>Catholick</hi>
would be; becauſe our prevailing in theſe things would give the
greateſt Blow to the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> here, that ever it received ſince
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:58185:29"/>
Birth; which perhaps he would not be very glad to ſee; eſpecially
when he believes there is another way of doing his Maſters
Buſineſs well enough without it; which is by a <hi>Diſſolution</hi> of the
Parliament; upon which I know he mightily depends, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes,
that if that comes to be <hi>Diſſolved,</hi> it will be aſmuch as
he needs care for; proceeding perhaps upon the ſame manner of
Diſcourſe which we had this time twelve months. But with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
to his better judgment, I do think that our Caſe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly
much altered to what it was, in Relation to a <hi>Diſſolution;</hi>
for then the Body of our Governing Miniſters (all but the Earl
of <hi>Arlington)</hi> were entirely United to the <hi>Duke;</hi> and would have
Governed his Way, if they had been free from all Fear and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul,
as they had been, if the Parliament had been Remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

Councells, and Embark't themſelves and Intereſts upon

To Diſſolve the Parliament ſimply, and without any other ſtep
made, will be to leave them to Govern what way they liſt,
which we have Reaſon to ſuſpect will be to the prejudice of
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Catholick Religion.</hi> And their late <hi>Declarations</hi> and <hi>Actions</hi> have
Demonſtrated to us, that they take that for the moſt Popular way
for themſelves, and likelieſt to keep them in abſolute Power;
whereas, if the <hi>Duke</hi> ſhould once get above them (after the Tricks
they have plaid with him) they are not ſure he will Totally forget
the Uſage he has had at their hands: Therefore it Imports us
now to Advance our Intereſt a little further, by ſome ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
as I have Named, before we <hi>Diſſolve</hi> the Parliament; Or
elſe perhaps, we ſhall but Change Maſters (a <hi>Parliament</hi> for Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters)
and continue ſtill in the ſame <hi>Slavery</hi> and <hi>Bondage</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
But one ſuch ſtep as I have propoſed, being well made;
we may ſafely ſee them <hi>Diſſolved,</hi> and not fear the Miniſters;
but ſhall be Eſtabliſhed, and ſtand Firm without any Oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;

                        <p>WE having taken into our Serious Conſideration the heats
and animoſities which have of late appeared among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of our very Loyal and Loving Subjects of this Kingdom, and
the many fears and jealouſies which ſome of them ſeem to lye
under, of having their Liberties and Properties invaded, or
their Religion altered; and withal, carefully reflecting upon
our own Government ſince our happy Reſtauration, and the end
and aim of it, which has always been the eaſe and ſecurity of
our People in all their Rights, and Advancement of the beauty
and ſplendour of the true Proteſtant Religion eſtabliſhed in
the Church of <hi>England;</hi> of both which we have given moſt ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Teſtimonies, even to the ſtripping our Self of many Royal
Prerogatives which our Predeceſſours enjoyed, and were our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
due; as the Court of Wards, Purveyances, and other
things of great value; and denying to our Self many advantages,
which we might reaſonably and legally have taken by the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures
made in the times of Rebellion, and the great Revenues
due to the Church at our Return, which no particular perſon
had any right to: inſtead of which, we conſented to an Act of
Oblivion of all thoſe Barbarous uſages which our Royal Father
and our Self had met withal, much more full and gracious than
almoſt any of our Subjects, who were generally become in ſome
meaſure or other obnoxious to the Laws, had confidence to ask;
and freely renounced all our Title to the Profit which we might
have made by the Church-Lands, in favour of our Biſhops and
other Eccleſiaſtical Miniſters, out of our zeal to the glory of our
Proteſtant Church; which Clemency to wards all, and ſome even
high Offenders, and zeal for Religion, we have to this day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
continued to exerciſe. Conſidering all this, we cannot
but be ſenſibly afflicted to ſee, that the frowardneſs of ſome few
Tumultuous heads ſhould be able to infect our Loyal and good
people with apprehenſions deſtructive of their own, and the
general quiet of our Kingdome; and more eſpecially, their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs
ſhould be powerful enough to diſtract our very Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſuch a Parliament, as has given as ſuch Teſtimonies
of its Loyalty, Wiſdom, and Bounty, and to which we
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:58185:31"/>
have given as many Marks of our affection and eſteem, ſo as to
make them miſ-conſter all our endeavours for to preſerve our
People in eaſe and proſperity, and againſt all reaſon and evidence
to repreſent them to our Subjects as Arguments of fear and
diſquiet; and under theſe ſpecious pretences of ſecuring Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Religion, to demand unreaſonable things, manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
of what they would be thought to aim at; and from our
frequent Condeſcentions, out of our meer grace, to grant them
what we conceived might give them ſatisfaction, though to the
actual prejudice of our Royal Prerogative, to make them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
to propoſe to advance ſuch extravagancies into Laws, as
they themſelves have formerly declared deteſtable; of which
we cannot forbear to give our truly Loyal Subjects ſome inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to undeceive our innocent and well-minded people, who
have many of them of late been too eaſily miſled, by the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
endeavours of ſome turbulent Spirits. For example, we
having judged it neceſſary to declare War againſt the States of
<hi>Holland,</hi> during a receſs of Parliament, which we could not
defer longer, without looſing an advantage which then preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it ſelf, nor have done ſooner, without expoſing our Honour
to a potent Enemy without due preparation, we thought it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
to unite all our Subjects at home, and did believe a general
Indulgence of tender Conſciences the moſt proper expedient to
effect it; and therefore did by our Authority in Eccleſiaſticks,
which we thought ſufficient to warrant what we did, ſuſpend
penal Laws againſt Diſſenters in Religion, upon Conditions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in our Declaration, out of Reaſon of State, as well as to
gratifie our own nature, which always we confeſs abhorr'd ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
eſpecially in Religion, when tenderneſs might be as uſeful.
After we had engaged in the War, we Prorogued our Parliament
from <hi>April</hi> to <hi>October,</hi> being confident we ſhould be able by that
time to ſhew our People ſuch ſucceſs of our Arms, as ſhould
make them cheerfully contribute to our charge. At <hi>October</hi>
we could have ſhewn them ſucceſs even beyond our own hopes, or
what they could poſſibly expect; our Enemies having loſt by that
time, near 100 ſtrong Towns and Forts taken in effect by us, we
holding them buſie at Sea, whilſt our Allies poſſeſſed themſelves
of their Lands, with little or no reſiſtance; and of which, the
great advantage would moſt viſibly have been ours, had not
the fewds we now complain of, which have been ſince unhappily
ſtarted, and factiouſly improved by ſome few, diſ-united our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:58185:32"/>
diſtracted our Counſels, and render'd our late endeavours
vain and fruitleſs; ſo that we had no reaſon to doubt of our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
ready and liberal concurrence to our Aſſiſtance in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture.
Yet our Enemies propoſing to us at that time a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
for Peace, which we were always ready to accept upon Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Terms; and conſidering with our ſelf that in caſe that
Treaty ſucceeded, a far leſs ſum of Money would ſerve our oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions,
than otherwiſe would be neceſſary: We out of our
tender regard to the eaſe of our People, Prorogued our Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
again to <hi>February,</hi> to attend the ſucceſs of our Treaty,
rather than to demand ſo much Money in <hi>October,</hi> as would be
fit to carry on the War. But we ſoon finding that our Enemies
did not intend us any juſt Satisfaction, ſaw a neceſſity of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting
the War, which we deſigned to do moſt vigourouſly;
and in order to it, reſolv'd to preſs our Parliament to ſupply us
as ſpeedily as may be, to enable us to put our Fleet to Sea early
in the Spring, which would after their Meeting grow on apace.
And being informed that many Members were dead during the
long Receſs, we Iſſued out our Writs for new Elections, that
our Houſe of Commons might be full at the firſt opening of the
Seſſions, to prevent any delay in our Publick Affairs, or diſlike
in our people, as might poſſibly have riſen from the want of ſo
great a number of their Repreſentatives, if any thing of moment
ſhould be concluded before it had been ſupplyed. Having go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd
our Actions all along with ſuch careful reſpect to the eaſe
of our Subjects, we at the Meeting of our Parliament in <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
1672. expected from them ſome ſuitable expreſſions of
their ſenſe of our Favours; but quite contrary, found our Self
alarm'd with Clamorous Complaints from ſeveral Cabals againſt
all our Proceedings, frighting many of our good Subjects into
ſtrange Conceits of what they muſt look for, by their Seditious
and falſe Conſtructions of what we had ſo Candidly and Sincerely
done for their good; and ſurpriſed with a Vote of our Houſe of
Commons, againſt our Writs of Elections, which we intended
for their ſatisfactions, againſt many Preſidents of ours, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any colour of Law of their ſide, denying our Power to
Iſſue out ſuch Writs, Addreſſing to us to Iſſue out others: which
we conſented to do at their Requeſt chooſing rather to yield
to our Subjects in that point, than to be forced to ſubmit to our
Enemies in others; hoping that our Parliament being ſenſibly
touched with that our extraordinary condeſcention, would go on
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:58185:32"/>
conſider the Publick concern of the Kingdom, without any
further to do: But We found another uſe made of Our ſo
eaſie compliance, which ſerv'd to encourage them to ask
more; ſo that ſoon after We found Our Declaration for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging
tender Conſciences Arraigned, Voted illegal; though
We cannot to this day underſtand the conſiſtences of that
Vote, with Our undoubted Supremacy in all Eccleſiaſticks,
Recognizing by ſo many Acts of Parliament, and required
to be Sworn to, by all Our Subjects, and Addreſſes made
to Us one after another to recal it, which We condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to alſo; from hence they proceeded to Us to weaken
Our Self in an Actual War, and to render many of Our
Subjects, of whoſe Loyalty and Ability We were well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,
incapable to ſerve Us, when We wanted Officers
and Soldiers, and had reaſon to invite as many Experienced
Men as We could to engage in Our Arms, rather than to
incapacitate or diſcourage any; yet this alſo We gratified
them in, to gain their Aſſiſtance againſt Our Enemies, who
grew high by theſe Our Differences, rather than expoſe
Our Countrey to their Power and Fury; hoping that in
time Our People would be confounded to ſee Our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions,
and be aſhamed of their Errors in making ſuch
Demands. But finding the unfortunate Effects of Our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions
the following Summer, We found Our Parliament
more extravagant at the next meeting than ever, addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to Us to hinder the Conſummation of Our Dear Brother's
Marriage, contrary to the Law of God, which forbiddeth
any to ſeparate any, whom he hath joyned, againſt Our Faith
and Honour engag'd in the Solemn Treaty, obſtinately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
in that Addreſs, after We had acquainted them, That
the Marriage was then actually ratifyed, and that We had
acted in it by Our Ambaſſador; ſo that We were forced to
ſeparate them for a while, hoping they would bethink them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
better at their meeting in <hi>January.</hi> Inſtead of being
more moderate or ready to conſider Our wants towards the
War; they Voted as they had done before, not to aſſiſt
Us ſtill, till their Religion were effectually ſecur'd againſt
Popery, Aggrievances redreſſed, and all obnoxious Men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
from Us; which We had reaſon to take for an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
denyal of all Aid; conſidering the indefiniteneſs of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:58185:33"/>
what was to proceed, and the Moral impoſſibility of effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
it in their ſences: for when will they ſay their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
is effectually ſecured from Popery, if it were in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
then, by reaſon of the inſolency of Papiſts. When Our
Houſe of Commons, which is made up of Members from
every Corner of Our Kingdom, with Invitations publickly
Poſted up to all Men to accuſe them, has not yet in ſo many
years as they have complained of them, been able to charge
one ſingle Member of that Communion, with ſo much as a
Miſdemeanour. Or what Security could they poſſibly expect
againſt that Body of Men, or their Religion, more than We
had given them? or how can we hope to live ſo perfectly,
that ſtudy and pains may not make a Collection of Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances,
as conſiderable as that which was lately preſented
to Us, than which VVe could not have wiſh'd for a better
Vindication of Our Government? or when ſhall VVe be ſure
that all obnoxious Men are removed from Us, when Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſame thinks fit to call them ſo; which is to every body,
without any proof, ſufficient to render any man obnoxious,
who is Popiſhly affected, or any thing elſe that is ill, though
they have never ſo often or lately complyed with their own
Teſts and Marks of Diſtinction and Diſcriminations. Finding
Our People thus unhappily diſordered, We ſaw it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to proſecute the War any longer; and therefore did by
their Advice make a Peace upon ſuch Conditions as we could
get; hoping that being gratified in that Darling Point,
they would at leaſt have paid Our Debts, and enabled Us
to have Built ſome Ships for the future Security of Our Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
and their own Properties; but they being tran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>
                           </gap>orted
with their ſucceſs in asking, were reſolved to go on ſtill
that way, and would needs have Us put upon the removing
of Our Judges from thoſe Charges, which they have always
hitherto held at the VVill and Pleaſure of the Crown, out
of Our Power to alter the ancient Laws of trying of Peers,
and to make it a Premunire in Our Subjects (in a caſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed)
not to fight againſt Our Self; nay, ſome had the
heart to ask, that the Hereditary Succeſſion of Our Crown
(which is the Foundation of all Our Laws) ſhould be
changed into a ſort of Election, they requiring the Heir
to be qualified with certain Conditions, to make him ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of Succeeding, and Out-doing that Popiſh Doctrine,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:58185:33"/>
which We have ſo long, and ſo loudly with good reaſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryed,
That Hereſie incapacitates Kings to Reign. They
would have had, That the Heir of the Crown, marrying a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt,
though he continued never ſo Orthodox himſelf, ſhould
forfeit his right of Inheritance; not underſtanding this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radoxical
way of ſecuring Religion by deſtroying it, as
this would have done that of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which
always taught Obedience to their Natural Kings, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſable
Duty in all good Chriſtians, let the Religion
or Deportment of their Prince be what it will; and not
knowing how ſoon that Impediment, which was ſuppoſed
as ſufficient to keep out an Heir, might be thought as fit
to remove a Poſſeſſor: And comparing that Bill which
would have it a Premunire in a Sheriff not to raiſe the
<hi>Poſſe Comitatus,</hi> againſt Our Commiſſion in a Caſe there
ſuppoſed, though We Our Self ſhould aſſiſt that Our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
in Our Perſon: for not being excepted, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
with the other made by this very Parliament in
the 14th year of Our Reign, which all Our Subjects,
or at leaſt many of them, were obliged to Swear (<hi>viz.</hi>)
That the Doctrine of taking up Arms by the King's
Authority againſt His Perſon, was deteſtable; and We
ſoon found that the Deſign was levelled againſt the
good Proteſtant Religion of Our good Church, which
its Enemies had a mind to Blemiſh, by ſliding in ſlily
thoſe damnable Doctrines, by ſuch an Authority as that
of Our Parliament, into the Profeſſion of Our Faith or
Practices, and ſo expoſe Our whole Religion to the
Scorn and Reproach of themſelves, and all the World: We
therefore thought it Our duty to be ſo watchful as to
prevent the Enemies ſowing ſuch miſchievous Tares as
theſe, in the wholſom Field of Our Church of <hi>England,</hi> and
to guard the unſpotted Spouſe of Our Bleſſed Lord, from
that foul Accuſation, with which ſhe juſtly charges other
Churches, of teaching their Children Loyalty, with ſo many
Reſerves and Conditions, that they ſhall never want a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to juſtifie Rebellion, nor a Text of Scripture, as good
as Curſe ye <hi>Meroz,</hi> to encourage them to be Traitors: whereas
Our truly Reformed Church knows no ſuch Subtilties; but
teaches according to the ſimplicity of Chriſtianity, To ſubmit
to every Ordinance of Man for God's ſake, according to the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:58185:34"/>
natural ſignification of the words, without equivocation or Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
turns. In order to which, having thought to diſſolve that
Body, which We have theſe many years ſo tenderly Cheriſhed,
and which We are ſure conſiſts generally of moſt Dutiful and
Loyal Members, We were forc'd to Prorogue Our Parliament
till <hi>November</hi> next, hoping thereby to cure thoſe Diſorders,
which have been ſown amongſt the Beſt and Loyalleſt Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
by a few malicious Incendiaries. But underſtanding ſince,
that ſuch who have ſowed that Seditious ſeed, are as induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
careful to water it by their Cabals, and Emiſſaries, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
on purpoſe to poiſon Our People with diſcourſes in
publick places, in hopes of a great Crop of Confuſion, their
beloved fruit, the next Seſſions; We have found it abſolutely
neceſſary to Diſſolve Our Parliament, though with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctancy
and violence to Our inclination: But remembring
the dayes of Our Royal Father, and the progreſs of Affairs then,
how from a Cry againſt Popery, the people went on to
complain of Grievances, and againſt Evil Councellors,
and His Majeſties Prerogative; untill they advanc'd into a
formal Rebellion; which brought forth the moſt dire and
fatal Effects, that ever were yet heard of amongſt any men,
Chriſtians or others; and withal, finding ſo great a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
between the Procedings then and now, that they
ſeem both Broth of the ſame brains: and being Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd
in that Conceit, by obſerving the Actions of many
now, who had a great ſhare in the management of the former
Rebellion, and their zeal for Religion, who by their lives give
us too much reaſon to ſuſpect they have none at all; VVe
thought it not ſafe to dally too long, as Our Royal Father did,
with ſubmiſſions and condeſcentions, endeavouring to cure
men infected, without removing them from the Air where
they got the diſeaſe, and in which it ſtill rages and increaſes
daily. For fear of meeting with no better ſucceſs than He
found, in ſuffering his Parliament to Challenge Power they
had nothing to do with, till they had bewitch'd the people
into fond deſires of ſuch things as quickly deſtroyed both King
and Country, which in Us would be an intollerable Error,
having been warn'd ſo lately by the moſt Execrable Murther
of Our Royal Father, and the inhumane Uſage, which We Our
Self in Our Royal Perſon and Family have ſuffered, and Our
Loyal Subjects have endured by ſuch practices; And leaſt this

Our great Care of this Our Kingdomes Quiet, and Our own
Honour and Safety ſhould, as Our beſt Actions have hitherto
been; be wreſted to ſome ſiniſter Sence, and Arguments be
made from it to ſcare Our Good People into any apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of an Arbitrary Government, either in Church or State;
We do hereby ſolemnly declare and faithfully engage Our
Royal Word; That VVe will in no caſe either Eccleſiaſtical
or Civil, violate or alter the known Lawes of Our Kingdom;
or invade any man's Property or Liberty, without due courſe
of Law. But that We will with Our utmoſt Indeavours, preſerve
the true Proteſtant Religion, and Redreſs all ſuch things as ſhall
indifferently, and without paſſion, be judg'd Grievances by Our
next Parliament; which We do by God's bleſſing intend to
Call before the end of <hi>February</hi> next. In the mean time, We
do ſtrictly Charge and Command all manner of perſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever,
to forbear to talk ſeditiouſly, ſlightly or irreverently
of Our Diſſolving of the Parliament, of this Our Declaration,
or of Our Perſon or Government, as they will anſwer it at
their perils; VVe being reſolv'd to proſecute all Offenders in
that kind with the utmoſt rigour and ſeverity of the Law.
And to the end that ſuch Licentious perſons, if any ſhall be ſo
impudent and obſtinate as to diſobey this Our Royal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
may be detected, and brought to due Puniſhment,
We have Ordered Our Lord Treaſurer to make ſpeedy pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Twenty pounds to any perſon or perſons, who
ſhall diſcover or bring any ſuch ſeditious, ſlight or irreverent
Talker before any of Our Principal Secretaries of State.</p>

                  <p>I Sent your Reverence a tedious long Letter on our 29<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of

2. or 3. laſt years; I having now again the opportunity of a

becauſe our Parliament now drawing on, I may poſſibly have
occaſion to ſend you ſomething which you may be willing
enough to know, and may be neceſſary for us that you ſhould,
when we may want the conveniency of a Meſſenger. When any
thing occurs of more concern other then which may not be
fit to be truſted even to a Cipher alone, I will, to make ſuch a
thing more ſecure, write in Lemmon between the Lines of a
Letter, which ſhall have nothing in it viſible, but what I care
not who ſees, but dryed by a warm fire, ſhall diſcover what is
written; ſo that if the Letter comes to your hands, and upon
drying it, any thing appears more then did before, you may be
ſure no body has ſeen it by the way. I will not trouble you with
that way of writing, but upon ſpecial occaſions, and then I will
give you a hint to direct you to look for it, by concluding my
viſible Letter with ſomething of fire or burning, by which
mark you may pleaſe to know, that there is ſomething under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,

                     <hi>We have here a mighty Work upon our Hands, no
leſs than the Converſion of three Kingdoms, and by that
perhaps the utter ſubduing of a Peſtilent Hereſie, which
has domineered over great part of this Northern World
a long time; there were never ſuch hopes of ſucceſs ſince
the Death of our Queen</hi> Mary, <hi>as now in our days.</hi>
When God has given us a Prince, who is become (may I
ſay a Miracle) zealous of being the Author and Inſtrument of
ſo glorious a Work; but the oppoſition we are ſure to meet
with, is alſo like to be great: So that it imports us to get
all the aid and aſſiſtance we can, for <hi>the Harveſt is great, and
the Labourers but few.</hi> That which we rely upon moſt, next to
God Almighty's Providence, and the favour of my Maſter the
Duke, is the mighty mind of His moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, whoſe
generous Soul inclines him to great undertakings, which being
managed by your Reverence's exemplary piety and prudence,
will certainly make him look upon this as moſt ſutable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
and beſt becoming his power and thoughts; ſo that I hope
you will pardon me if I be very troubleſom to you upon this
occaſion, from whom I expect the greateſt help we can
hope for. I muſt confeſs I think His Chriſtian Majeſty's Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Intereſt is ſo much attracted to that of his R. H. (which
can never be conſiderable, but upon the growth and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Catholick Religion) that his Miniſters cannot give
him better advice, even in a Politick ſence, abſtracting from
the conſiderations of the next World, that of our Bleſſed Lord,
<hi>to ſeek firſt the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Righteouſneſs thereof,
that all other Things may be added unto him.</hi> That I know His
moſt Chriſtian Majeſty has more powerful motives ſuggeſted
to him by his own Devotion, and your Reverences zeal for
God's Glory, to engage him to afford us the beſt help he can
in our preſent circumſtances. But we are a little unhappy in
this, that we cannot preſs His Majeſty by his preſent Miniſter
here upon theſe latter Arguments (which are moſt ſtrong) but
only upon the firſt, Mr. <hi>Rouvigny</hi>'s ſence and ours differing very
much upon them, though we agree perfectly upon the reſt:
And indeed, though he be a very able Man as to his Maſter's
ſervice in things where Religion is not concerned; yet I believe
it were much more happy (conſidering the poſture he is now
in) that his temper were of ſuch a ſort, that we might deal
clearly with him throughout, and not be forc'd to ſtop ſhort
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:58185:37"/>
in a Diſcourſe of conſequence, and leave the moſt material
part out, becauſe we know it will ſhock his particular Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and ſo perhaps meet with diſlike and oppoſition, though
never ſo neceſſary to the main concern. I am afraid we ſhall
find too much reaſon for this Complaint in this next Seſſion
of Parliament: for had we had one here from His moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Majeſty, who had taken the whole buſineſs to heart, and
who would have repreſented the ſtate of our Caſe truly, as it
is, to his Maſter, I do not doubt but His moſt Chriſtian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
would have engag'd himſelf further in the affair than at
preſent I fear he has done, and by his approbation have given
ſuch Counſels as have been offered to his R. H. by thoſe few
Catholicks who have acceſs to him, and who are bent to ſerve
him and advance the Catholick Religion with all their might,
and might have more credit with his R. H. than I fear they
have found, and have aſſiſted them alſo with his Purſe as far
as 10000 Crowns, or ſome ſuch ſum (which to him is very
inconſiderable, but would have been to them of greater uſe
than can be imagined) towards gaining others to help them,
or at leaſt not to oppoſe them. If we had been ſo happy as
to have had His moſt Chriſtian Majeſty with us to this degree,
I would have anſwered with my life for ſuch ſucceſs this Seſſions,
as would have put the Intereſt of the Catholick Religion, his R. H.
and His moſt Chriſtian Majeſty out of all danger, for the time
to come. But wanting thoſe helps of recommending thoſe
neceſſary Counſels, which have been given his R. H. in ſuch
manner as to make him think them worth his accepting, and
fit to govern himſelf by, and of thoſe advantages, which a
little Money well managed, would have gained us. I am
afraid we ſhall not be much better at the end of this Seſſions
than we are now; I pray God we do not loſe ground. By
my next, which will be e're long, I ſhall be able to tell your
Reverence more particularly, what we are like to expect. In
the mean time I moſt humbly beg your Holy Prayers for all
our undertakings, and that you will be pleaſed to honour me
ſo far as to eſteem me what I am entirely, and without any
reſerve.</p>

               <p>My Lord, I never ſaw Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> but in the Council-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
I never ſaw him in <hi>Rome,</hi> in other Parts I never ſaw the Face

               <p>No man ſhall be guilty, if denial ſhall make
him innocent; They ſwear to the Fact of killing the King
both of them, and that's enough. If one ſaith you have a
Plot to poyſon that is killing the King; and the other
ſwears a Plot to ſhoot, or ſtab him, that is to the killing of

I hope there's none in that, though there are very extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant

               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>No, your Deſign was for the Converſion of

ſo long in this Northern part of the World: And for ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting
whereof, <hi>there were never more hopes ſince our
Queen</hi> Mary'<hi>s time till now,</hi> and therefore preſſing
the King of <hi>France</hi> to uſe his Power, Aid, and Aſſiſtance,

               <speaker>Priſ.</speaker>
               <p>Doth Aid and Aſſiſtance ſignifie more than Money?

            </sp>

               <p>Conſider the Contexture and Connexion of things,

               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>How well or ill you excuſe the fault, that's
not the Queſtion; they relate to the Duke moſt of them, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to the King. You were carrying on ſuch a Deſign, that

rejected.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Priſ.</speaker>
               <p>Do not think I would throw any thing upon the
Duke, though I might (in the beginning of it) poſſibly
make uſe of the Dukes Name, it is poſſible (they ſay I did)
but can any imagine the people will lay down Money
<hi>200000l.</hi> or <hi>20000l.</hi> with me upon the Dukes Name, and
not know whether the Duke be in it; and conſequently no
body will imagine the Duke would ever employ any ſum to
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:58185:39"/>
this Kings prejudice or diſſervice while he lived. I take it
for granted (which ſure none in the world will deny) that
the Law was ever made immediately ſubject to the King or
Duke, and conſequently to the Duke, I cannot think this
will ever be expounded by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> or the Jury,

            <sp>
               <speaker>L. Ch. Juſt.</speaker>
               <p>What a kind of way and talking is this?
You have ſuch a ſwimming way of melting words, that it is
a troubleſom thing for a man to collect matter out of them.
You give your ſelf up to be a great Negotiator in the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Kingdoms, you would be great with mighty men for
that purpoſe; and your long Diſcourſes and great Abilities
might have been ſpared. The thing theſe Letters do ſeem
to import, is this, That your Deſign was to bring in Popery
into <hi>England,</hi> and to promote the intereſt of the <hi>French</hi>
King in this place, for which you hoped to have a Penſion
(that's plain.) The Dukes Name is often mentioned, that's
true; ſometimes it appears it is againſt his will, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he might know of it, and be told that the conſequence
was not great. Now ſay you theſe Sums of Money and all
that was done, it did relate to the King or Duke, and it was
to advance their intereſt, and you thought it was the way to
do it. How can this advance them unleſs it were done to do
them ſervice; and if they do not conſent to it, and how
can this be Treaſon, what kind of ſtuff is this? You do
ſeem to be a mighty Agent, might not you for a colour uſe
the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Name to drive on the Catholick Cauſe,
which you was driven to by the Prieſts mightily, and think
to get <hi>200000l.</hi> advance money, and a Penſion for your ſelf,
and make your ſelf ſomebody for the preſent, and Secretary
of State for the future? If you will make any defence for your
ſelf, or call in Witneſſes, we will hear them; ſay what you can;
for theſe vain inconſequential diſcourſes ſignifie nothing.</p>

the Proteſtant Religion, all are comprehended in it.</p>
                        <p>The defence the Priſoner has made is ſo very ſhort, and of ſo

                        <p>The firſt Crime laid in the Indictment, is the deſign of killing

                        <p>
                           <hi>And theſe Treaſons have been punctually proved, as well by
two Witneſſes, as by Letters under Mr.</hi> Colemans <hi>own Hand,

                           <hi>As to the Proofs made by the Witneſſes, the ſubſtance of
them is this. Mr.</hi> Oates <hi>ſwears, that in</hi> April <hi>laſt</hi> Old Style,
<hi>and</hi> May New Style, <hi>there was a General Conſult or Meeting of
the</hi> Jeſuites, <hi>at the</hi> White-Horſe-Tavern <hi>in the</hi> Strand; <hi>and
afterwards they divided themſelves into ſeveral Companies, or
Clubs; and in thoſe Conſults they conſpired the Death of the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:58185:40"/>
King, and contrived how to effect it. The manner of it was
thus, (as Mr.</hi> Oates <hi>poſitively ſwears</hi>) <hi>That</hi> Grove <hi>and</hi> Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering
<hi>were imployed to murther the King; and their deſign
was to Pistol him in St.</hi> James'<hi>s Park.</hi> Grove <hi>was to have
Fifteen hundred Pounds in Money, and</hi> Pickering [(being a
Priest) was to have Thirty thouſand Maſſes, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to be of equal value to Fifteen hundred Pounds, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the uſual price in the Church of] Rome. <hi>And this
Conſpiracy and Contrivance Mr.</hi> Coleman <hi>was privy to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
did well approve of the ſame, as Mr.</hi> Oates <hi>affirmeth upon
his Oath. So that here is a plain Treaſon proved upon the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner,
by his aſſenting to the Fact to be done, the Law not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
any Acceſſaries in Treaſon. And this in Law makes
the Priſoner as guilty as any of the Aſſaſſinates, who deſigned
to kill the King with their own Hands.</hi>

                           <hi>If this deſign ſhould fail, Mr.</hi> Oates <hi>ſwears, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators
intended a farther attempt upon the Royal Perſon of
the King, when be ſhould be at</hi> Windſor; <hi>and four</hi> Iriſh <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinates
were provided by Doctor</hi> Fogarty, <hi>whoſe Names he
would not tell, and fourſcore Guinneys were provided by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
Harcourt (<hi>a</hi> Jeſuit) <hi>to maintain the Aſſaſſinates at</hi> Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor,
<hi>till they ſhould have effected their wicked deſign.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>While the Conſpiracy was thus in agitation, Mr.</hi> Coleman,
<hi>the Priſoner, went to viſit</hi> Harcourt <hi>the</hi> Jeſuit <hi>at his Houſe in
Town; but finding him not at home, and being informed that
he was at</hi> Wild-houſe, <hi>Mr.</hi> Coleman <hi>went thither and found
him there; and Mr.</hi> Coleman <hi>asking what Proviſion</hi> Harcourt
<hi>had made for the Gentlemen at</hi> Windſor; Harcourt <hi>replyed,
that there were fourſcore Guinneys, which then lay upon the
Table, which were to be ſent to them; and ſaid, that the
Perſon who was in the Room was to carry them. To which
Mr.</hi> Coleman <hi>replyed, he liked it very well; and gave a
Guinney out of his own Pocket to the Meſſenger who was to carry
the Money to</hi> Windſor, <hi>to encourage him to expedite the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.
But in caſe the deſign of killing his Majeſty at</hi> Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor
<hi>ſhould be any ways prevented, then there was a further
Conſpiracy, to destroy the King by Poiſon. Mr.</hi> Oates <hi>ſwears,
that in</hi> July <hi>laſt,</hi> Aſhby (<hi>a</hi> Jeſuit) <hi>brought instructions to</hi>
London <hi>from</hi> Flanders, <hi>that in caſe</hi> Pickering <hi>and</hi> Grove
<hi>could not kill the King at</hi> London, <hi>nor the four</hi> Iriſh <hi>Aſſaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates
at</hi> Windſor, <hi>then Ten thouſand Pounds was to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to Sir</hi> George Wakeman <hi>to poyſon the King. But it did
appear by the Letters that paſſed between</hi> White <hi>the Provincial
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:58185:40"/>
(here in</hi> London) <hi>and</hi> Aſhby, <hi>that Mr.</hi> Coleman <hi>ſaid, he
thought ten thouſand Pounds was too little; and therefore
thought it neceſſary to offer five thouſand Pounds more, which
afterwards was aſſented to by the</hi> Jeſuites <hi>abroad. And Mr.</hi>
Oates <hi>ſwears, he ſaw Letters from the Provincial at</hi> London,
<hi>to the</hi> Jeſuites <hi>at St.</hi> Omer, <hi>ſignifying, that Sir</hi> George
Wakeman <hi>had accepted of the Propoſition, and received five
thouſand Pounds of the Money. By which Teſtimony, of Mr.</hi>
Oates, <hi>it plainly appears, that Mr.</hi> Coleman, <hi>the Priſoner at
the Bar, was privy to the Conſpiracy, and aiding and abetting
to the wicked and damnable deſign of murdering the King.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The ſecond Witneſs is Mr.</hi> Bedlow, <hi>who ſwears that he was
imployed by</hi> Harcourt, <hi>the</hi> Jeſuit, <hi>to carry Pacquets of Letters
to Monſieur</hi> Le Cheſe, <hi>the</hi> French <hi>Kings Confeſſor; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſays, he was at a Conſult in</hi> France, <hi>where the Plot was
diſcourſed on for killing the King; and did bring back an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
from</hi> Le Cheſe <hi>to</hi> Harcourt <hi>in</hi> London, <hi>and ſwears par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
that on the</hi> 24th <hi>or</hi> 25th <hi>of</hi> May, 1677. <hi>he was at</hi>
Colemans <hi>Houſe with Father</hi> Harcourt, <hi>and ſome other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
where Mr.</hi> Coleman, <hi>diſcourſing of the great deſign in
hand, ſaid theſe Words following.</hi> That if he had a Sea of
Blood, and an hundred Lives, he would loſe them all to
carry on the deſign; and if to effect this, it were neceſſary to
deſtroy an hundred Heretick Kings, he would do it. <hi>So that
here is another poſitive Oath to an Act of Treaſon committed
by Mr.</hi> Coleman, <hi>in relation to the murthering the King.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>The other part of the Evidence conſiſts of Papers and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which generally relate to prove the latter part of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment;
to wit,</hi> The Extirpation of the Proteſtant Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and introducing of Popery, and the ſubverting of the
Government. <hi>And this appears by a Letter written by Mr.</hi>
Coleman, <hi>dated</hi> 29. Septem 75. <hi>and ſent to Monſieur</hi> Le
Cheſe, <hi>the</hi> French [<hi>Kings Confeſſor; wherein he gives him an
account of the Tranſactions of ſeveral years before, and of the
Correſpondence between Mr.</hi> Coleman <hi>and Monſieur</hi> Ferrier,
<hi>Predeceſſor to</hi> Le Cheſe; <hi>wherein he does alſo aſſert, that the
true way to carry on the Intereſt of</hi> France, <hi>and the promoting of
the</hi> Popiſh <hi>Religion here in</hi> England, <hi>was, to get this Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
diſſolved; which (ſays he) had been long ſince effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
if three hundred thouſand Pounds could have been obtained
from the</hi> French King; and that things yet were in ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture,
that if he had but Twenty thouſand Pounds ſent him from
<hi>France,</hi> he would he content to be a Sacrifice to the utmoſt
malice of his Enemies, if the Proteſtant Religion did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive]
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:58185:41"/>
ſuch a blow as it could not ſubſiſt. And the receipt of
this Letter was acknowledged by Monſieur <hi>Le Cheſe,</hi> in an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
which he wrote to Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> dated from <hi>Paris
Oct.</hi> 23. 75. in which he gives him thanks for his good Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
in order to the promoting the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Several other Letters have been produced and read, which
were written by Mr.</hi> Coleman <hi>to Monſieur</hi> Ferrier <hi>and others,
and more particularly one Letter dated</hi> Auguſt 21. 74. <hi>writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
by Coleman to the Popes Internuntio at</hi> Bruſſels, <hi>wherein
he ſays the Deſign proſpered ſo well, that he doubted not but
in a little time the buſineſſe would be managed,</hi> to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ruine of the Proteſtant Party.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>And by other Letters he writes to the</hi> French <hi>Kings Confeſſor
that the aſſistance of his most Christian Majeſty is neceſſary,
and deſires Money from the</hi> French <hi>King to carry on the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>But there is one Letter, without Date, more Bloody than
all the reſt, which was written to Monſieur</hi> Le Cheſe <hi>in ſome
ſhort time after the long Letter of</hi> September 29. 1675. <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
amongst many other things,</hi> Coleman <hi>expreſſes himſelf thus.</hi>
We have a mighty Work upon our Hands, no
leſs than the Converſion of three Kingdoms,
and the utter ſubduing of a Peſtilent Hereſie,
which hath for ſome time domineer'd over this
Northern part of the World; and we never
had ſo great hopes of it ſince our Q. <hi>Mary</hi>'s days.
<hi>And in the Concluſion of the Letter he implores Monſieur</hi> Le
Cheſe <hi>to get all the aid and aſſiſtance he can from</hi> France, <hi>and
that next to God Almighty, they did rely upon the mighty mind
of his moſt Christian Majesty, and therefore did hope</hi> le Cheſe
<hi>would procure Money and Aſistance from him.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now any Man that conſiders the Contents of theſe Letters,
muſt needs agree, that the latter part of the Indictment, to
wit, the Treaſon of endeavouring the Subverting the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and the Protestant Religion, is fully proved upon Mr.
<hi>Coleman,</hi> the Priſoner at the Bar; and that theſe Letters
were written by him, and the Anſwers received he does not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.
But all he has to ſay for himſelf, is that it was to make
the King of <hi>England</hi> great; whereas the contrary is moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,
becauſe the <hi>Jeſuits who love Force and Tyranny, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
adhere to thoſe Princes that are greatest in Strength and
Power. For it appears in Hiſtory, that when the Houſe of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:58185:41"/>
Auſtria</hi> were in their greatneſs, and like to arrive to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Monarchy in theſe parts of the World, the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> all
adhered to that Houſe; But ſince the <hi>French</hi> King hath
grown more mighty in Power and Greatneſs, they declined the
Intereſt of the <hi>Auſtrian</hi> Family, and do now promote the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
of <hi>France,</hi> thinking that now that King will become the
<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Monarch.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>I ſhall therefore now conclude the Evidence, only obſerving
to the Jury, that the ſeveral Treaſons in the Indictment are
fully proved. The firſt as to the destruction of the Royal
Perſon of the King, by two Witneſſes, Mr.</hi> Oates, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
<hi>the other part of it, viz. the ſubverſion of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and extirpation of the Proteſtant Religion, by the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Letters which have been before remembred, which have not
been denyed by the Priſoner to be his. Therefore I hope Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
when you meet with Offenders that are guilty of ſuch
ſtupendious Crimes, you will do Juſtice upon them, which will
be a great Comfort and Satisfaction to the King and all his
good Proteſtant Subjects.</hi>

               <p>Gentlemen, You hear the Crime is of
the higheſt nature, it's the ſubverſion of three Kingdoms
and the ſubduing of that Religion which he defames by the
name of <hi>Peſtilent Hereſie.</hi> It concerns us all to look about
us, and all the Kingdom, when there ſhall be a Deſign ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
in this manner, to deſtroy our King, and to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
our Religion, and to enſlave us all to the Pope, and
make us all truckle to the Prieſts.</p>
               <p>It is wonderful it is capable (at this day) of ſo great Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
there is <hi>Digitus Dei</hi> in it, or elſe it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
ſuch a thing ſhould be made ſo manifeſt: All the
reſt that is ſaid in the Indictment are but Circumſtances that
declare it: There is a ſtrong Evidence of many matters of
Fact in this Deſign, which declare the Intention hatched in
his Breaſt for many years together: Here hath been a Deſign
to kill the King, and he doth not only conſent to it, but
commend it; what can be ſaid to his giving the Money to
him that was to pay the fourſcore pieces of Gold to thoſe
<hi>Ruffians</hi> ſent to <hi>Windſor?</hi> and adding 5000 <hi>l.</hi> to the <hi>10000l.</hi>
for the Doctor that was to poyſon the King? He denies all.</p>
               <p>No queſtion but a Man that hath had a Heart to deſign
ſuch Contrivances, will have the Face to deny it publickly:
It's a thing to be acted in the dark, but there's both Mr. <hi>Oates</hi>
and Mr. <hi>Bedlow</hi> plainly prove it upon him, that he conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the acting the Kings death What's the Sence of his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:58185:42"/>
but to ſhew his deſign, and to beg the Aſſiſtance of
<hi>France</hi> to them in their neceſſities? the whole Current is to
deſtroy our Religion. I think you Gentlemen of the Jury
have had ſuch Evidence as will ſatisfie any Man.</p>

ſumming up of the Evidence.</head>
                        <p>Gentlemen of the Jury; My Care at this time ſhall be to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
this very long Evidence, and to bring it within a ſhort
compaſs, that you may have nothing before you to conſider of, as
near as I can, but what is really material to the Acquitting or
Condemning of Mr. <hi>Coleman.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The things he is Accuſed of are of two ſorts; the one is,
to ſubvert the Proteſtant Religion and to introduce Popery:
the other was to deſtroy and kill the King. The Evidence
likewiſe was of two ſorts; The one by Letters of his own hand
writing, and the other by Witneſſes <hi>Viva voce.</hi> The former
he ſeems to confeſs, the other totally to deny.</p>
                        <p>For that he confeſſeth, he does not ſeem to inſiſt upon it,
that the Letters were not his, he ſeems to admit they were; And
he rather makes his Defence by expounding what the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of theſe Letters were, than by denying himſelf to be the
Author.</p>
                        <p>I would have you take me right, when I ſay he doth ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit;
he doth not admit the Conſtruction, that the Kings Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
here makes upon them: but he admits that theſe Letters
were his. He admits it ſo far, that he does not deny them.
So that you are to Examine what theſe Letters import in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
and what Conſequences are naturally to be deduced from
them.</p>
                        <p>That which is plainly intended, is to bring in the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick,</hi>
and to ſubvert the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion. That which is
by Conſequence intended, was the Killing the King, as being
the moſt likely means to introduce <hi>That,</hi> which as 'tis apparent
by his Letters, was deſigned to be brought in.</p>
                        <p>For the Firſt part of the Evidence. All his Great long Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that he wrote, was to give the preſent Confeſſor of the
<hi>French</hi> King an Account of what had paſſed between him and
his predeceſſor; By which Agency, you may ſee that Mr. <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
was In with the former Confeſſor.</p>
                        <p>And when he comes to give an Account of the three years
Tranſactions to this preſent Confeſſor, and to begin a Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
with him, About what is it? Why, the ſubſtance
of the Heads of the long Letter comes to this. It was to bring
in the <hi>Catholick</hi> as he call'd it, (that is) the <hi>Romiſh Catholick</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:58185:43"/>
and to eſtabliſh that here; and to advance an Intereſt for
the <hi>French</hi> King, be that Intereſt what it will.</p>
                        <p>It's true, his Letters do not expreſs what ſort of Intereſt,
neither will I determine: but they ſay it was to promote the
<hi>French</hi> Kings Intereſt, which Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> would expound in
ſome ſuch ſort, as may conſiſt with the King of <hi>Englands,</hi> and
the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Intereſt. But this is certain, it was to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
our Religion, as it is now by Law eſtabliſhed. This was the
great end thereof, it cannot be denyed: To promote the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
(I ſay) of the <hi>French</hi> King, and to gain to himſelf a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
as a reward of his ſervice, is the Contents of his Firſt long
Letter, and one or two more concerning that Pention.</p>
                        <p>His laſt Letters expound more plainly what was mea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t by the
<hi>French</hi> Kings Intereſt. <hi>We are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>about a great work,
no leſs than the Converſion of three Kingdoms, and the totall and
utter ſubverſion and ſubduing of that peſtilent Hereſie (that is the
Protestant Religion) which hath reigned ſo long in this Northern
part of the World; and, for the doing of which, there never was
ſuch great hopes ſince our Queen</hi> Maries <hi>Days, as at this time.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now this plainly ſhews, that our Religion was to be ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
Popery eſtabliſhed, and the three Kingdoms to be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
that is indeed, to be brought to confuſion.</p>
                        <p>For I ſay, that when our Religion is to be ſubverted, the
Nation is to be ſubverted and deſtroyed, that is moſt apparent:
For there could be no hope of ſubverting or deſtroying the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
Religion, but by a <hi>Subverſion,</hi> not <hi>Converſion</hi> of the
three Kingdoms.</p>
                        <p>How was it to be done otherwiſe? Why, I would have
brought this Religion in (ſays he) by diſſolving of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I would have brought it in by an Edict and Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Liberty of Conſcience. In theſe ways I would have
brought it in.</p>
                        <p>Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> knows it is not fit for him to own the introducing
of his Religion by the Murder of the King, or by a Forein Force.
The one was too <hi>black</hi> and the other too <hi>bloody,</hi> to be owned.
And few people (eſpecially the <hi>Engliſh</hi>) will be brought to ſave
their Lives (as he may do his) by confeſſion of ſo bloody and
barbarous a thing, as an intention to Kill the King, or of Levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a War; which though it be not a <hi>Particular,</hi> is a <hi>General</hi> Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.
I ſay, it was not convenient for Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> when he ſeem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>
to ſpeak ſomething for himſelf, to give ſuch an Account, how
he would have done it; Therefore he tells us, he would have
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:58185:43"/>
done it by the diſſolving of the Parliament and by Toleration of
Religion. Now I would very fain know of any man in the World,
whether this was not a very fine and artificial covering of his
deſign for the Subverſion of our Religion?</p>
                        <p>Pray, how can any man think, that the Diſſolving of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
could have ſuch a mighty influence to that purpoſe?
It is true, he might imagine it might in ſome ſort contribute
towards it: Yet it is ſo doubtful, that he himſelf miſtruſts it. For
he is ſometimes for the Diſſolving of the Parliament, and other
times not, as appears by his own papers: For which we are not
beholding to him, ſo much as for any one, more than what were
found by accident, and produced to the King and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.
But in truth, why ſhould Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> believe that ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Parliament (if this Parliament were Diſſolved) ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
with Popery? That is to ſay, That there ſhould be great
hopes of bringing in of Popery by a new Parliament? Unleſs he
can give me a good reaſon for this, I ſhall hold it as inſignificant
and as unlikely to have that effect, as his other way by a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Toleration.</p>
                        <p>And therefore next, Upon what ground does he preſume this?
I do aſſure you, that man does not underſtand the inclinations
of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> people, or knows their Tempers, that thinks, if
they were left to themſelves and had their Liberty, they would
turn Papiſts.</p>
                        <p>It's true, there are ſome amongſt us that have ſo little Wit
as to turn Fanaticks, but there is hardly any, but have much
more wit than to turn Papiſts. Theſe are therefore the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
pretentions of Mr. <hi>Coleman.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now if not by theſe means, In what way truly did he intend to
bring in Popery? Why his own Letters plainly convict him of one
ſtep towards it, in endeavouring with Foreign powers to bring
in that Religion, and to Subvert ours. And for the other way of
doing it, by killing the King; I leave it to you whether there
were any more probable way than that indeed to do it.</p>
                        <p>And could he think, that the <hi>French</hi> King would not have
thought himſelf cozened of his Money, if he had not given
him hopes that he would uſe the moſt probable Methods that
he could, to effect his Deſign?</p>
                        <p>Therefore there muſt be more in it; for he that was ſo earneſt
for that Religion, would not have ſtuck at any Violence to bring
it in; he would not have ſtuck at blood. For we know their
Doctrines and their Practiſes, and we know well, with what zeal
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:58185:44"/>
the Prieſts puſh them forward to venture their own Lives, and
to take away other mens, that differ from them, to bring in their
Religion, and to ſet up themſelves. For indeed in the Kingdoms
and Countries where Popery reigns, the Prieſts have Dominion
over mens Conſciences, and power over their purſes. And they
uſe all Arts imaginable of making Proſelites, and take ſpecial
Care, that thoſe in their Communion, ſhall know no more than
the Prieſts ſhall give them leave to underſtand. And for this
Reaſon they prohibit the uſe of all Books without their Licenſe.
This blind Obedience begets blind Ignorance, and this is a great
ſubtilty of theirs to keep them in it, that they may perfectly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to them,</p>
                        <p>What cannot they Command, when they have made others
ſlaves in their underſtandings, and that they muſt know no more,
then what they give them leave to know? But in <hi>England</hi> it is not
ſo Mr. <hi>Coleman;</hi> and therein you would have found a great diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.
For if Liberty of Conſcience had been tollerated
here, That the Conſequence of it would have been Popery, I
deny.</p>
                        <p>Nothing is more unlikely, for though in the ſhort Reign of
Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> Popery came in for ſome time, which was but for
a little time, and then the people were not ſo well grounded in
the Proteſtant Religion, nor in the principles of it: But now
they are, Inſomuch, that ſcarce a Cobler but is able to baffle
any <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſt that ever I ſaw or met with.</p>
                        <p>And Thanks be to God we have a Preaching Miniſtry, and
the free uſe of the Scriptures allowed amongſt us, which they
are not permitted to have.</p>
                        <p>And after this I wonder, that a man, who hath been bred up
in the Proteſtant Religion (as I have Reaſon to believe that you
Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> have been) for (if I am not miſinformed) your
Father was a Miniſter in <hi>Suffolk.</hi> For ſuch a one to depart from
it, is an Evidence againſt you, to prove the Indictment. I
muſt make a Difference between Us, and Thoſe who have
been always educated that way, and ſo are under the prepoſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their Education, which is a difficult thing to be overcome.</p>
                        <p>And I do aſſure you, there are but two things, that I know
of, can make one do it, Intereſt, or groſs Ignorance.</p>
                        <p>No man of underſtanding, but for By-ends, would have left
his Religion to be a Papiſt. And for you Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> who are
a man of Reaſon and Subtilty, I muſt tell you (to bring this to
your ſelf) upon this account, that it could not be Conſcience,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:58185:44"/>
I cannot think it to be Conſcience. Your Pention was your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
and your Secretaries place your Bait.</p>
                        <p>For ſuch men (I ſay) as have been bred up in the Proteſtant
Religion, and left it, I can hardly preſume that they do it out of
Conſcience, unleſs they do it upon a mighty ſearch, not leaning
upon their own underſtanding and abilities, nor hearing of one
ſide alone.</p>
                        <p>Conſcience is a tender thing, Conſcience will tremble when
it leaves the Religion it has been bred in, and its ſincerity is
ſhown by being fearful, leaſt it ſhould be in the wrong.
No man may pretend to Conſcience truly, that takes not
all Courſes imaginable to know the <hi>Right,</hi> before he lets
his Religion ſlip from him.</p>
                        <p>Have we ſo ſoon forgot our Reverence to the late King,
and the pious advice he left us? A King that was truly
A DEFENDER of the FAITH, not onely by his Title,
but by his Abilities and Writings. A King, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the Proteſtant Religion ſo well, that he was able to
defend it againſt any of the Cardinals of <hi>Rome.</hi> And
when he knew it ſo throughly, and died ſo eminently for
it, I will leave this Characteriſtical Note, That whoſoever
after that, departs from <hi>His</hi> Judgment, had need have a very
good one of his own, to bear him out.</p>
                        <p>I do acknowledge, Many of the Popiſh Prieſts formerly,
were learned men, and may be ſo ſtill, beyond the Seas:
but I could never yet meet with any here, that had other Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or Ability but Artificial onely, to delude <hi>weak</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and <hi>weaker</hi> Men.</p>
                        <p>They have indeed, ways of Converſion, and Conviction,
by Enlightning our Underſtandings with a Faggot, and by
the powerful and irreſiſtable Arguments of a Dagger: But
there are ſuch wicked Soloeciſms in their Religion, that they
ſeem to have left them neither <hi>Natural Senſe,</hi> nor <hi>Natural
Conſcience.</hi> Not <hi>Natural Senſe</hi> by their Abſurdity, in ſo an
unreaſonable a belief, as of the Wine turned into Blood:
Not <hi>Natural Conſcience,</hi> by their Cruelty, who make the
Proteſtants Blood as Wine, and theſe Prieſts thirſt after it.</p>
                        <p>

                        <p>Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> in one of his Letters, ſpeaks of rooting out
<hi>our Religion, and our Party;</hi> And he is in the Right,
for they can never root out the Proteſtant Religion, but
they muſt kill the Proteſtants. But let him and them know,
if ever they ſhall endeavour to bring Popery in, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
of the King, they ſhall find, that the Papiſts will
thereby bring deſtruction upon themſelves, ſo that not a
man of them would eſcape.</p>

King hath ſince I have been ſeized on, ſeized on my Papers and my
book of Accounts where I uſed punctually to ſet down where I ſpent
my money; and if it doth not appear by that book that I was all thoſe
days and times, and ſeveral other days in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to be out of Town, I
deſire no favour. You cannot ſuppoſe my Lord, nor the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
that I prepared that book for this purpoſe in this matter; and I
can make it appear by others, if I had time; but I only offer this to your
Lordſhip, that ſeeing Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> did name ſo many particulars and
circumſtances, it's very ſtrange that he ſhould fail in a particular of
ſuch Importance as about killing the King; and no man living of
common ſenſe would think or believe that I ſhould ſpeak about ſuch a
thing in company that I did not well know, and this to be done fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
and oftentimes as he aſſerts it, when <hi>Oates</hi> ſeem'd to the King
and Council (and I believe the King himſelf remembers it) when I
was examined, that he did not know me, that he knew nothing of me,
ſo that here is two things againſt this witneſs that can hardly happen
again.</p>
                  <p>My Circumſtances are extraordinary, and it is a great providence,
and I think your Lordſhip and the whole world will look upon it as
ſuch, if for any Crimes that are in my Papers, if there be any mercy
to be ſhowed me by the Kings Gracious Act of Pardon, I humbly beg
that I may have it.</p>

                  <p>You are found guilty Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> of High Treaſon, and
the Crimes are ſeveral that you are found Guilty of. You are found
Guilty of Conſpiring the death of the King; you are likewiſe found
Guilty of endeavouring to ſubvert the Proteſtant Religion as it is by
Law Eſtabliſhed, and to bring in Popery, and this by the aid and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of Forraign Powers. And I would not have you Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> in
your laſt apprehenſion of things, to go out of the World with a miſtake
if I could help it, That is, I would not have you think, that though
you only ſeem to diſavow the matter of the death of the King, that therefore you ſhould think your ſelf an Innocent man. You are not
Innocent I am ſure, for it is apparent by that which cannot deceive,
that you are guilty of Contriving and Conſpiring the Deſtruction of
the Proteſtant Religion, and to bring in Popery, and that by the aid
and aſſiſtance of Forraign Powers, and this no man can free you in the
leaſt from. And know, that if it ſhould be true, that you would
diſavow, that you had not an actual hand in the Contrivance of the
Kings death (which two witneſſes have ſworn poſitively againſt you):
yet he that will ſubvert the Proteſtant Religion here, and bring in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentially
a Forraign Authority, do's an act in derogation of the
Crown, and in Diminution of the Kings Title and Soveraign Power;
and endeavours to bring a Forraign Dominion both over our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
and Eſtates And if any man ſhall endeavour to ſubvert our Religion
to bring in that, though he did not actually contrive to do it by the
Death of the King, or it may be not by the death of any one man, yet
whatſoever follows upon that contrivance, he is guilty of; Inſomuch,
it is greatly to be fear'd, that though you meant only to bring it in by
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:58185:47"/>
the way of Diſſolving of Parliaments, or by Liberty of Conſcience,
and ſuch kind of innocent ways as you thought, yet if ſo be thoſe
means ſhould not have proved Effectual, and worſe ſhould have been
taken (though by others of your Confederates) for to go through with
the work, as we have great reaſon to believe there would,
you are guilty of all that blood that would have followed.
But ſtill you ſay you did not deſign that thing; but to tell you, he
that doth a ſinful and unlawful Act, muſt anſwer, and is liable both to
God and man for all the conſequences that attend it, therefore I ſay you
ought not to think your ſelf innocent. 'Tis poſſible you may be peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and nothing remains but that. And as I think in your Church
you allow of a thing called Attrition, if you cannot with our Church,
have Contrition, which is a ſorrow proceeding from Love, Pray make
uſe of Attrition, which is a ſorrow ariſing from Fear. For you may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
your ſelf, there are but a few moments betwixt you and a vaſt
Eternity, where will be no dallying, no arts to be uſed, therefore
think on all the good you can do in this little ſpace of time that is left
you, all is little enough to wipe off (beſides your private and ſecret of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences)
even your publick ones. I do know that Confeſſion is very much
owned in your Church, and you do well in it; but as your offence is
publick, ſo ſhould your Confeſſion be; and it will do you more ſervice
then all your Auricular Confeſſions. Were I in your caſe, there ſhould
be nothing at the bottom of my heart that I would not diſcloſe; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
you may be deluded with the fond hopes of having your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
reſpited. Truſt not to it Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> you may be flatter'd to
ſtop your mouth, till they have ſtopt your breath, and I doubt you
will find that to be the event. I think it becomes you as a man, and as
a Chriſtian, to do all that is now in your power, ſince you cannot be
white, to make your ſelf as clean as you can, and to fit your ſelf for
another world, where you will ſee how vain all reſolutions of obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of concealment, and all that ſort of bravery which perhaps may be
inſtil'd by ſome men, will prove. They will not then ſerve to leſſen but
they will add to your fault. It concerns Us no farther than for your
own good, and Do as God ſhall direct you, for the truth is, There
are perſwaſions and inducements in your Church to ſuch kind of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions
and ſuch kind of Actions, which you are led into by falſe
Principles and falſe Doctrines (and ſo you will find when you come
once to experiment it, as ſhortly you will) that hardly the Religion of
a Turk would own. But when Chriſtians by any violent bloody Act
attempt to propagate Religion, they abuſe both their Diſciples and
Religion too, and change that way that Chriſt Himſelf taught us to
follow him by. 'Twas not by blood or violence; By no ſingle
mans undertaking to diſturb and to alter Governments; To make hurly
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:58185:48"/>
burlies, and all the miſchiefs that attend ſuch things as theſe are.</p>
                  <p>For a Church to perſwade men even to the Committing of the higheſt
Violences, under a pretence of doing God good ſervice, looks not (in
my Opinion) like Religion, but Deſign; like an Engine, not a Holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution;
Artificial as a Clock, which follows not the Sun but the Setter;
Goes not according to the Bible but the Prieſt, whoſe Interpretations
ſerve their particular ends, and thoſe private advantages which True
Religion would ſcorn, and Natural Religion it ſelf would not endure.
I have Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> ſaid thus much to you as you are a Chriſtian, and
as I am one, and I do it out of great Charity and Compaſſion, and with
great ſenſe and ſorrow that you ſhould be miſlead to theſe great offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
under pretence of Religion. But ſeeing you have but a little time,
I would have you make uſe of it to your beſt advantage; for I tell you,
that though death may be talkt of at a diſtance in a brave Heroick way,
yet when a man once comes to the minute, death is a very ſerious thing;
then you will conſider how trifling all Plots and Contrivances are, and
to how little purpoſe is all your concealments. I only offer theſe
things to your thoughts, and perhaps they may better go down at ſuch
a time as this is then at another; and if they have no effect upon you,
I hope they will have ſome as to my own particular, in that I have done
my good will. I do remember you once more, that in this matter you
be not deluded with any fantaſtick hopes and expectations of a Pardon,
for the Truth is Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> you will be deceived; therefore ſet your
heart at Reſt, for we are at this time in ſuch diſorders, and the people
ſo continually Alarm'd either with ſecret Murthers, or ſome Outrages
and Violences that are this day on foot, that though the King, who is
full of mercy almoſt to a fault, yet if he ſhould be inclined that way, I
verily believe both Houſes would interpoſe between that and you. I
ſpeak this to ſhake off all vain hopes from you; for I tell you I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they would not you ſhould have any Twigg to hold by to deceive
you; ſo that now you may look upon it, there is nothing will ſave you,
for you will aſſuredly dy-as now you live, and that very ſuddenly. In
which I having diſcharged my Conſcience to you as a Chriſtian, I
will now proceed to pronounce Sentence againſt you, and do my
duty as a Judge.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>You ſhall return to Priſon, from thence be drawn to the place of Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,

your bowels burnt before your face, and your Quarters ſever'd, and your

                  <p>Between God and your Conſcience be it, I have other appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions;

                  <p>I am ſatisfied. But ſeeing my time is but ſhort, may I not
be permitted to have ſome immediate Friends, and my poor Wife to
have her freedom to ſpeak with me, and ſtay with me that little time
that I have, that I might ſpeak ſomething to her in order to her living
and my dying.</p>

                  <p>You ſay well, and it is a hard Caſe to deny it; but I tell you
what hardens my heart, the Inſolencies of your Party, the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
I mean, that they every day offer, which is indeed a proof of their
Plot, that they are ſo bold and Impudent, and ſuch ſecret Murders
Committed by them, as would harden any mans heart to do the Common
favours of Justice and Charity, that to mankind is uſually done: they
are ſo bold and inſolent, that I think it is not to be endured in a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Kingdom; but for my own parlicular, I think it is a very hard
thing for to deny a man the Company of his Wife, and his Friends, ſo it
be done with Caution and Prudence; Remember that the Plot is on foot,
and I do not know what Arts the Prieſts have, and what Tricks they uſe;
and therefore have a care that no Papers nor any ſuch thing, be ſent from
him.</p>

any thing in that kind, that may be for his Eternal good, and as much
for his preſent ſatisfaction that he can receive now in the condition that
be is in, let him have it, but do it with Care and Caution.</p>
