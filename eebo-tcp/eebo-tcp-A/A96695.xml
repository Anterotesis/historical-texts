         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ſtanding portion of livelihood to us and our children, without
that cheating intanglement of buying and ſelling, and we ſhall
not arreſt one another.</p>
            <p>And then, what need have we of impriſoning, whipping or
hanging Laws, to bring one another into bondage? and we know
that none of thoſe that are ſubject to this righteous law dares ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
or inſlave his brother for, or about the objects of the earth,
becauſe the earth is made by our Creator to be a common Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury
of livelihood to one equall with another, <hi>without respect
of perſons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now if you that are elder brothers; and that call the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures
your own land, hedging out others, if you will have
Magiſtrates and Laws in this outward manner of the Nations,
we are not againſt it, but freely without diſturbance ſhall let you
alone; and if any of we Commoners, or younger Brothers,
ſhall ſteal your corne, or cattell, or pull down your hedges, let
your laws take hold upon any of us that ſo offends.</p>
            <p>But while we keep within the bounds of our Commons, and
none of us ſhall be found guilty of medling with your goods,
or incloſed proprieties, unleſſe the Spirit in you freely give it
up, your laws then ſhall not reach to us, unleſſe you will op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe
or ſhed the blood of the innocent: and yet our corn and
cattell ſhall not be locked up, as though we would be propria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
in the middle of the Nation: no, no, we freely declare, that
our corn and cattell, or what we have, ſhall be freely laid open,
for the ſafety and preſervation of the Nation; and we as youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
brothers, living in love with you our elder brothers, for we
ſhall endeavour to do, as we would be done unto; that is, to let
every one injoy the benefit of his Creation, to have food and
rayment free by the labour of his hands from the earth.</p>
            <p>And as for ſpirituall teachings, we leave every man to ſtand
and fall to his own Maſter: if the power of covetouſneſſe be
his Maſter or King that rules in his heart, let him ſtand and fall
to him; if the power of love and righteouſneſſe be his Maſter
or King that rules in his heart, let him ſtand and fall to him; let

Ruler and Judge both in us and over us; and by thus doing,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:116129:3"/>
we ſhall honor our Father, the Spirit that gave us our being. And
we ſhall honor our Mother the earth, by labouring her in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe,
and leaving her free from oppreſſion and bondage.</p>
            <p>We ſhall then honor the higher powers of the left hand man,
which is our hearing, ſeeing, taſting, ſmelling, feeling, and walk
in the light of reaſon and righteouſneſſe, that is, the King and
Judge that ſits upon this five cornered Throne, and we ſhall be
ſtrengthned by thoſe five well ſprings of life, of the right hand
man, which is, underſtanding, will, affections, joy and peace, and
ſo live like men, in the light and power of the Son of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
within our ſelves feelingly. What need then have we of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
outward, ſelfiſh, confuſed Laws made, to uphold the power
of covetouſneſſe, when as we have the righteous Law written in
our hearts, teaching us to walk purely in the Creation.</p>
            <p>Sir, The intent of our writing to you, is not to requeſt your
protection, though we have received an unchriſtian-like abuſe
from ſome of your ſouldiers; for truly we dare not caſt off the
Lord, and make choice of a man or men to rule us. For the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
hath ſmarted deeply for ſuch a thing, ſince Iſrael choſe <hi>Saul</hi>
to be their King; therefore we acknowledge before you in plain
Engliſh, That we have choſen the Lord God Almighty to be our
King and Protector.</p>
            <p>Yet in regard you are our brethren (as an Engliſh Tribe) and
for the preſent are owned to be the outward Governors, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors
and Saviours of this Land, and whoſe hearts we queſtion
not, but that you endeavour to advance the ſame King of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
with us, therefore we are free to write to you, and to
open the ſincerity of our hearts freely to you, and to all the
world.</p>
            <p>And if after this report of ours, either you, or your Forces cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
ſouldiers, or any that owns your Laws of propriety, called
freeholders, do abuſe or kill our perſons, we declare to you that
we die, doing our duty to our Creator, by endeavouring from
that power he hath put into our hearts to lift up his Creation
out of bondage, and you and they ſhall be left without excuſe
in the day of Judgement, becauſe you have been ſpoken to ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently.</p>
            <p>And therefore our reaſon of writing to you is this, in regard
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:116129:3"/>
ſome of your foot ſouldiers of the Generalls Regiment, under
Captain <hi>Stravie</hi> that were quartered in our Town, we bearing
part therein as well as our neighbours, giving them ſufficient
quarter, ſo that there was no complaining, did notwithſtanding,
go up to George-hill, where was onely one man and one boy of
our company of the diggers. And at their firſt coming, divers of
your ſouldiers, before any word of provocation was ſpoken to
them, fell upon thoſe two, beating the boy, and took away his
coat off his back, and ſome linnen and victualls that they had,
beating and wounding the man very dangerouſly, and fired our
houſe.</p>
            <p>Which we count a ſtrange and Heatheniſh practiſe, that the
ſouldierie ſhould meddle with naked men, peaceable men,
Countrymen, that meddled not with the ſouldiers buſineſſe, nor
offered any wrong to them in word or deed, unleſſe, becauſe we
improve that victory which you have gotten in the name of the
Commons over King <hi>Charles,</hi> do offend the ſouldierie. In do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
whereof, we rather expect protection from you then deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
But for your own particular, we are aſſured of your mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
and friendſhip to us, who have ever been your friends in
times of ſtraits; and that you would not give Commiſſion to
ſtrike us, or fire or pull down our houſes, but you would prove
us an enemy firſt.</p>
            <p>Yet we do not write this, that you ſhould lay any puniſhment
upon them, for that we leave to your diſcretion, only we deſire
(in the requeſt of brethren) that you would ſend forth admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to your ſouldiers, not to abuſe us hereafter; unleſſe they
have a Commiſſion from you; and truly if our offences ſhould
prove ſo great, you ſhall not need to ſend ſouldiers for us, or
to beat us, for we ſhall freely come to you upon a bare letter.</p>
            <p>Therefore that the ignorant, covetous, free-holders, and ſuch
of your ignorant ſouldiers, that know not what freedom is, may
not abuſe thoſe that are true friends to Englands freedom, and
faithfull ſervants to the Creation, we deſire, that our buſineſſe
may be taken notice of by you, and the higheſt Councell the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
and if our work appear righteous to you, as it does to us,
and wherein our ſouls have ſweet peace, in the midſt of ſcandalls
and abuſes;</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:116129:4"/>
Then in the requeſt of brethren, we deſire we may injoy our
freedom, according to the Law of contract between you and us,
That we that are younger brothers, may live comfortably in the
Land of our Nativity, with you the elder brothers, enjoying the
benefit of our Creation, which is food and rayment freely by our
labours; and that we may receive love, and the protection of
brethren from you, ſeeing we have adventured eſtate and perſons
with you, to ſettle the Land in peace, and that we may not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed
by your Laws, nor by your ſouldiers, unleſſe we break o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
into your incloſures as aforeſaid, and take away your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieties,
before you are willing to deliver it up. And if this you
do, we ſhall live in quietneſſe, and the Nation will be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
peace, while you that are the ſouldierie, are a wall of fire round
about the Nation to keep out a forraign enemy, and are ſuccou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of your brethren that live within the Land, who indeavour
to hold forth the Sun of righteouſneſſe in their actions, to the
glory of our Creator.</p>
            <p>And you and the Parliament hereby, will be faithfull in your
Covenants, Oaths and promiſes to us, as we have been faithfull
to you and them, in paying taxes, giving free-quarter, and affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
other aſſiſtance in the publike work, whereby we that are
the Common People, are brought almoſt to a morſell of bread,
therefore we demand our bargain, which is freedom, with you in
this Land of our Nativity.</p>
            <p>But if you do ſleight us and our cauſe, then know we ſhall not
ſtrive with ſword and ſpeare, but with ſpade and plow and ſuch
like inſtruments to make the barren and common Lands fruitful,
and we have, and ſtill ſhall, commit our ſelves and our cauſe unto
our righteous King, whom we obey, even the Prince of peace to
be our Protector; and unto whom you likewiſe profeſſe much
love, by your preaching, praying, faſtings, and in whoſe name
you have made all your Covenants, Oaths, and promiſes to us: I
ſay unto him we appeal, who is and will be our righteous Judge,
who never yet failed thoſe that waited upon him, but ever did
judge the cauſe of the oppreſſed righteouſly.</p>
            <p>We deſire that your Lawyers may conſider theſe queſtions
(which we affirm to be truths) and which gives good aſſurance
by the Law of the Land, that we that are the younger brothers
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:116129:4"/>
or common people, have a true right to dig, plow up and dwell
upon the Commons, as we have declared.</p>
            <p>1. Whether <hi>William the Conqueror</hi> became not to be King of
England by conqueſt, turned the Engliſh out of their birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rights,
burned divers townes, whereof thirty towns were burned
by him in Windſore Forreſt; by reaſon whereof all ſorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſuffered, and compelled the conquered Engliſh for neceſſity
of livelihood to be ſervants to him and his Norman ſouldiers?</p>
            <p>2. Whether King <hi>Charles</hi> was not ſucceſſor to the Crown of
England from <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> and whether all Laws that
have been made in every Kings Reign, did not confirm and
ſtrengthen the power of the Norman Conqueſt, and ſo did, and
does ſtill hold the Commons of England under ſlavery to the
Kingly power, his Gentry and Clergie?</p>
            <p>3. Whether Lords of Mannours were not the ſucceſſors of
the Colonells and chief Officers of <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> and
held their Royalty to the Commons by Leaſe, Grant and Paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
from the King, and the power of the ſword was and is the
ſeale to their Title?</p>
            <p>4. Whether Lords of Mannours have not loſt their Royalty
to the common land, ſince the common People of England, as
well as ſome of the Gentry, have conquered King <hi>Charles,</hi> and
recovered themſelves from under the Norman Conqueſt?</p>
            <p>5. Whether the Norman Conqueror took the land of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
to himſelf, out of the hands of a few men, called a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or from the whole body of the Engliſh People? Surely he
took freedom from every one, and became the diſpoſer both of
incloſures and commons; therefore every one, upon the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the conqueſt, ought to return into freedom again, vvithout
reſpecting perſons, or els vvhat benefit ſhall the common people
have (that have ſuffered moſt in theſe vvars) by the victory that
is got over the King? It had been better for the common peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
there had been no ſuch conqueſt; for they are impoveriſhed
in their eſtates by Free-quarter and Taxes, and made vvorſe to
live then they vvere before. But ſeeing they have paid Taxes, and
given Free-quarter according to their eſtates, as much as the
Gentry to theirs, it is both reaſon and equity that they ſhould
have the freedom of the land for their livelihood, vvhich is the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:116129:5"/>
benefit of the commons, as the Gentry hath the benefit of their
incloſures.</p>
            <p>6. Whether the freedom which the common people have
got, by caſting out the Kingly power, lie not herein principally,
to have the land of their nat<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vity for their livelihood, freed from
intanglement of Lords, Lords of Mannours, and Landlords,
which are our task-maſters. As when the enemy conquered Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
he took the land for his own, and called that his freedom;
even ſo, ſeeing all ſorts of people have given aſſiſtance to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
England from under the Norman yoke, ſurely all ſorts, both
Gentry in their incloſures, Commonalty in their Commons,
ought to have their freedom, not compelling one to work for
wages for another.</p>
            <p>7. Whether any Lawes ſince the coming in of Kings, have
been made in the light of the righteous law of our creation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
all alike, or have not been grounded upon ſelfiſh princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
in feare or flattery of their King, to uphold freedom in the
Gentry and Clergie, and to hold the common people under
bondage ſtill, and ſo reſpecting perſons?</p>
            <p>8. Whether all Lawes that are not grounded upon equity and
reaſon, not giving a univerſal freedom to all, but reſpecting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
ought not to be cut off with the Kings head? we affirm they
ought.</p>
            <p>If all lawes be grounded upon equity and reaſon, then the
whole land of England is to be a common treaſury to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one that is born in the land: But if they be grounded upon
ſelfiſh principles, giving freedom to ſome, laying burdens upon
others, ſuch lawes are to be cut off with the Kings head; or els
the neglecters are Covenant, Oaths and Promiſe-breakers, and
open hypocrites to the whole world.</p>
            <p>9. Whether every one without exception, by the law of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
ought not to have liberty to enjoy the earth for his live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood,
and to ſettle his dwelling in any part of the Commons
of England, without buying or renting Land of any; ſeeing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one by Agreement and Covenant among themſelves, have
paid taxes, given free-quarter, and adventured their lives to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
England out of bondage? we affirm, they ought.</p>
            <p>10. Whether the Laws that were made in the daies of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:116129:5"/>
Kings, does give freedom to any other people, but to the gentry
and Clergy, all the reſt are left ſervants and bondmen to thoſe
task-maſters; none have freedom by the Laws, but thoſe two
ſorts of people, all the common people have been, and ſtill are
burdened under them.</p>
            <p>And ſurely if the common people have no more freedom in
England, but only to live among their elder brothers, and work
for them for hire; what freedom then have they in England, more
then we can have in Turkie or France? For there, if any man will
work for wages, he may live among them, otherwiſe no: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
conſider, whether this be righteous, and for the peace of the
Nation, that Laws ſhall be made to give freedom to impropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
and Free-holders, when as the poor that have no land, are
left ſtill in the ſtraights of beggery, and are ſhut out of all liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
but what they ſhall pick out of fore bondage, by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for others, as Maſters over them, and if this be not the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of the Norman yoke, let rationall men judge: therefore
take not away men, but take away the power of tyranny and
bad government, the price is in your hand, and let no part
of the Nation be wronged for want of a Repreſentative.</p>
            <p>And here now we deſire your publike Preachers, that ſay, they
preach the righteous law, to conſider theſe queſtions, which
confirms us in the peace of our hearts, that we that are the
common people born in England, ought to improve the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
as we have declared, for a publike Treaſury and liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
and that thoſe that hinder us are rebells to their Maker,
and enemies to the Creation.</p>
            <p>Firſt, we demand I or No, whether the earth with her fruits,
was made to be bought and ſold from one to another? and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
one part of mankind was made a Lord of the land, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
part a ſervant, by the law of Creation before the fall?</p>
            <p>I affirme, (and I challenge you to diſprove) that the earth was
made to be a common Treaſury of livelihood for all, <hi>without
reſpect of perſons,</hi> and was not made to be bought and ſold: And
that mankind in all his branches, is the lord over the Beaſts, Birds,
Fiſhes, and the Earth, and was not made to acknowledge any of
his owne kind to be his teacher and ruler, but the ſpirit of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
only his Maker, and to walk in his light, and ſo to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:116129:6"/>
live in peace, and this being a truth, as it is, then none ought to
be Lords or Landlords over another, but the earth is free for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
ſon and daughter of mankind, to live free upon.</p>
            <p>This queſtion is not to be anſwered by any text of Scripture,
or example ſince the fall, but the anſwer is to be given in the
light of it ſelf, which is the law of righteouſneſſe, or that Word
of God that was in the beginning, which dwells in mans heart,
and by which he was made, even the pure law of creation, unto
which the creation is to be reſtored.</p>
            <p>Before the fall, <hi>Adam,</hi> or the Man did dreſſe the garden, or
the earth, in love, freedom, and righteouſneſſe, which was his
reſt and peace: But when covetouſneſſe began to riſe up in him,
to kill the power of love and freedom in him, and ſo made him
(mankind) to ſet himſelf one man above another, as <hi>Cain</hi> lifted
up himſelf above <hi>Abel,</hi> which was but the outward declaration
of the two powers that ſtrive in the man <hi>Adams</hi> heart; and
when he conſented to that ſerpent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> covetouſneſſe, then he fell
from righteouſneſſe, was curſed, and was ſent into the earth to
eat his bread in ſorrow: And from that time began particular
propriety to grow in one man over another; and the ſword
brought in propriety, and holds it up, which is no other but the
power of angry covetouſneſſe: For, <hi>Cain</hi> killed <hi>Abel,</hi> becauſe
<hi>Abels</hi> principles, or religion, was contrary to his. And the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of the ſword is ſtill <hi>Cain</hi> killing <hi>Abel,</hi> lifting up one man ſtill
above another. But <hi>Abel</hi> ſhall not alwaies be ſlain, nor alwaies
lie under the bondage of <hi>Cains</hi> curſed propriety, for he muſt riſe:
And that <hi>Abel</hi> of old was but a type of <hi>Christ,</hi> that is now ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
up to reſtore all things from bondage.</p>
            <p>2. I demand, whether all wars, blood-ſhed, and miſery came
not upon the Creation, when one man indeavoured to be a lord
over another, and to claime propriety in the earth one above a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother?
your Scripture will prove this ſufficiently to be true.
And whether this miſery ſhall not remove (and not till then)
when all the branches of mankind ſhall look upon themſelves as
one man, and upon the earth as a common Treaſury to all, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
reſpecting perſons, every one acknowledging the law of
righteouſneſſe in them and over them, and walking in his light
purely? then caſt away your buying and ſelling the earth, with
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:116129:6"/>
her fruits, it is unrighteous, it lifts up one above another, it make<gap reason="illegible: over-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
one man oppreſſe another, and is the burthen of the Creation.</p>
            <p>3. Whether the work of reſtoration lies not in removing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe,
caſting that Serpent out of heaven, (mankind) and
making man to live in the light of righteouſneſſe, not in words
only, as Preachers do, but in action, whereby the Creation ſhines
in glory? I affirm it.</p>
            <p>4. Whether is the King of righteouſneſſe a <hi>reſpecter of perſons</hi>
yea, or no? If you ſay no, then who makes this difference, that
the elder brother ſhall be lord of the land, and the younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a ſlave and beggar? I affirm, it was and is covetouſneſſe,
ſince the fall, not the King of righteouſneſſe before the fall, that
made that difference; therefore if you will be Preachers, hold
forth the law of righteouſneſſe purely, and not the confuſed
law of covetouſneſſe, which is the murtherer: the law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
would have every one to injoy the benefit of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that is, to have food and rayment by his labour freely in
the land of his nativity, but covetouſneſſe will have none to
live free, but he that hath the ſtrongeſt arme of fleſh; all others
muſt be ſervants.</p>
            <p>5. Whether a man can have true peace by walking in the Law
of covetouſneſſe and ſelf, as generally all do, or by walking in the
Law of univerſall righteouſneſſe; doing as he would be done by?
I affirm there is no tr<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e peace, till men talk leſſe, and live more
actually in the power of univerſall righteouſneſſe. Then you
Preachers, lay aſide your multitude of words, and your ſelfiſh do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,
for you confound and delude the people.</p>
            <p>6. Whether does the King of righteouſneſſe bid you love or
hate your enemies, if you ſay love them, then I demand of you,
why do ſome of you in your Pulpits, and elſwhere, ſtir up the
people to beat, to impriſon, put to death or baniſh, or not to
buy and ſell with thoſe that endeavour to reſtore the earth to a
common treaſury again? ſurely at the worſt, you can make them
but your enemies; therefore love them, win them by love, do
not hate them, they do not hate you.</p>
            <p>7. Whether it be not a great breach of the Nationall Covenant,
to give two ſorts of people their freedom, that is, Gentry and
Clergy, and deny it to the reſt? I affirm it is a high breach, for
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:116129:7"/>
mans Laws makes theſe two ſorts of people, the Antichriſtian
task-maſters over the common people. The one forcing the
people to give them rent for the earth, and to work for hire for
them. The other which is the Clergy, that force a maintenance of
tithes from the people; a practiſe which Chriſt, the Apoſtles and
Prophets never walked in; therefore ſurely you are the falſe
Chriſts, and falſe Prophets, that are riſen up in theſe latter daies.</p>
            <p>Thus I have declared to you, and to all in the whole world,
what that power of life is, that is in me. And knowing that the.
Spirit of righteouſneſſe does appear in many in this Land, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
all of you ſeriouſly in love and humility, to conſider of this
buſineſſe of publike community, which I am carried forth in the
power of love, and clear light of univerſall righteouſneſſe, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
as much as I can; and I can do no other, the Law of love in
my heart does ſo conſtrain me, by reaſon whereof I am called
fool, mad man, and have many ſlanderous reports caſt upon me,
and meet with much fury from ſome covetous people, under all
which my ſpirit is made patient, &amp; is guarded with joy and peace:
I hate none, I love all, I delight to ſee every one live comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.
I would have none live in poverty, ſtraits or ſorrows; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
if you find any ſelfiſhneſſe in this work, or diſcover any thing
that is deſtructive to the whole Creation, that you would open
your hearts as freely to me in declaring my weakneſſe to me, as I
have been open-hearted in declaring that which I find and feel
much life and ſtrength in. But if you ſee righteouſneſſe in it, and
that it holds forth the ſtrength of univerſall love to all without
reſpect to perſons, ſo that our Creator is honored in the work
of his hand, then own it, and juſtifie it, and let the power of love,
have his freedom and glory.</p>
