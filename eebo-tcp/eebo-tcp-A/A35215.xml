         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>HAVING lately preſented your
Honours with <hi>An Eſſay on Coin
and Credit,</hi> the chief Deſign
whereof was to ſhew the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of Setling a well-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Credit in this Nation, for Support of
the Government and carrying on its Trade;
I do now with all Humility lay before you
Propoſals to anſwer that end, which I have
not clogg'd with Compulſion to the Subject,
ſuppoſing nothing of this Nature can be good,
where a Common Conſent, grounded on In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
doth not make it valuable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:98649:4"/>
BANKS, as I humbly conceive, ought
chiefly to be Calculated for the Uſe of Trade,
and modeled ſo as may beſt content the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
What gives them Satisfaction will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
all other Occaſions of the Kingdom.
Money paſſes through the Hands of the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and Gentry, only as Water doth through
Conduit-Pipes into the Ciſtern, but Centers
in the Hands of Traders, where it Circulates,
and may be ſaid to be uſed; and among
theſe, Eaſe, Profit, and Security, are Arguments
ſtrong ennough to keep a Bank always full;
Beſides, when the Streights of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
are taken off, greater Sums will come
into Trade, which are now drawn out in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to make Advantages above what the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
of Trade will bring in.</p>
            <p>The Heads whereon I propoſe to build this
National Credit, are theſe which follow:</p>
            <p>That a Bank be Erected on the Credit of
the Parliament, the Profit or Loſs thereof to
redound to the Nation, whoſe chief Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

Diſtances as may beſt Anſwer the Occaſions

appointed by Parliament.</p>

the Rate aforeſaid for ſo much as doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main

            <p>That if any one deſires to take up Money

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I. As to the <hi>Firſt,</hi> It hath the Legiſlative
Power of the Kingdom of <hi>England</hi> for its
Foundation, a Security ſtrong enough,
and nothing elſe can be ſo, to build this
Great Superſtructure upon, the well Mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deling
whereof, will keep it from being
ſubject to the Deſigns of Private Perſons;
This will laſt ſo long as the Peoples Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
laſt, for no Change can weaken it, ſo
long as the People of <hi>England</hi> have a hand
in making their own Laws, whoſe Common
Intereſt will be ſo rivited and made up with
the Security of this Bank, that they will in
a ſhort time become one thing, ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
leſs than a Conqueſt will be able to
ſhake it; This we cannot fear from any
Nation beſides the <hi>French,</hi> nor from them
neither till <hi>Holland</hi> is firſt ſubdued, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as thoſe States muſt firſt truckel, ſo far
will our Bank be more ſecure than theirs;
<hi>France</hi> cannot Erect a Bank on any ſort of
Security, becauſe the Will of that Prince
being his Law, alters according to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Occaſions; Nor can <hi>Spain</hi> do it; where,
not only the Government, but alſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
thereof, are divided amongſt its Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98649:7"/>
As for <hi>Sweden, Denmark</hi> and <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,</hi>
the Princes of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> few
believe their Circumſtances to be ſuch as to
render them capable of Erecting a Bank
which may draw the Eyes of <hi>Europe</hi> to look
towards it; <hi>England</hi> only can do it, for
as an eaſie Government is its own Security,
ſo that Security encourages Trade, and theſe
two, accompanied with the Profits offered to
a running Caſh, will make all <hi>Europe</hi> deſire
to ſettle their Moneys here.</p>
            <p>Seeing then that nothing but the ſame
Power which firſt Conſtituted this Bank can
deſtroy it, (a Power with whom we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt
our Lives, Liberties, and Eſtates) I
cannot ſee the leaſt room left for diſtruſt;
for what advantage can any future Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
expect by a deſign of ſeizing this
Bank, when the Treaſure thereof may be
drawn out whilſt they are framing the
Law; and the Conſequence will be the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ining
their own Eſtates, for which they can
promiſe nothing to themſelves, ſave the being
poſſeſt of Empty Papers:</p>
            <p>What farther Hazard the Nation can run,
muſt proceed from the Neglect of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers,
or the Fraud of under Officers, which,
Care in the Firſt, and Security for the Laſt,
will prevent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:98649:7"/>
II. The next thing is to ſhew the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
which <hi>England</hi> will reap by ſetling
the Credit here propoſed; whereof ſome
do immediately attend it, others are Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential.</p>
            <p>Thoſe which immediately attend it are,</p>
            <p>1ſt, The Rate of Intereſt will hereby be
brought lower, to the advance of our Lands,
and Encouragement of our Trade, by Methods
altogether as profitable to the Uſurer, who
will be willing to let his Money Cheaper,
when it ſhall never lye dead without his
Conſent, his Security be unqueſtionable, and
freed from the Charges of Litigious Suits,
which ſo frequently accompany doubtful
Mortgages.</p>
            <p>2dly, Both Gentlemen and Traders will
hereby be ſupplied with Money to ſerve their
Occaſions on ſuch reaſonable Security as they
are able to give, when that Security ſhall be
ſtrengthened by having the Preheminence
above all other Obligations; They may
alſo have liberty to pay it in by ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
as they can beſt ſpare it, when it
ſhall be equally the Intereſt of the Bank to
receive it ſo, which will never want new op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities
to let it out again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:98649:8"/>
3dly, This Credit will give us an Eſteem
in Foreign Parts, Draw their Moneys hither,
and conſequently their Trade, and thereby
their People, all which will be an Advantage
to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4ly, It will ſupply the Government with
Money to carry on the War on moderate In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
and make its Credit good; whereby the
Publick Revenues will reach farther to ſerve
its Occaſions, and the Miniſters of State be
freed from many anxious Thoughts which
now make them uneaſie.</p>
            <p>5ly, It will make Returns from place to
place in <hi>England</hi> both cheap and certain,
which will help our Inland Trade, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
Robberies, now too much encouraged
by travelling with Money; It will alſo be
profitable to our Foreign Trade, by bringing
Exchanges low in our favour.</p>
            <p>6ly, The Frauds put on the Country by
Counterfeit Notes will be prevented; for
though the method of Indentures and Stain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Paper now uſed by the Bank of <hi>England</hi>
may be a Security to it ſelf, yet it is not ſo
to any one elſe, ſeeing Art is able to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
every thing, at leaſt ſo like, as not to
be eaſily diſcovered; Now what Satisfaction
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98649:8"/>
will it be to thoſe who have received their
Notes inſtead of Money, to be told by the
Managers that they are Counterfeit, when
they know not where, nor from whom to
get Reparation; whereas being Aſſigned
from Man to Man, they are taken on the
Credit of the Aſſignor, who runs no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
riſque thereby, ſave his Warrant that
they are truly what he pays them for.</p>
            <p>7ly, This Bank will be free from Stock-Jobbing,
the Bane of all good Deſigns,
which will find no room here, becauſe it
cannot be divided into private and perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Intereſts.</p>
            <p>The Conſequential Advantages will be
theſe,</p>
            <p>1ſt, By this means the Taxes for carrying
on the War the enſuing Year, together with
the Twenty five hundred and ſixty four
thouſand Pounds which fell ſhort on the
Salt Fund, may be raiſed, by Methods
wherein the Kings Revenue and the Peoples
Profits ſhall go hand in hand, without Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipations.</p>
            <p>2ly, The Funds now ſetled on our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures,
which diſcourage our Trade, and
ruin our Poor, may be ſunk and taken off;
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98649:9"/>
ſuch are thoſe on the <hi>Glaſs-makers, Tobacco-pipe-makers,
Diſtillers,</hi> and others, many
whereof have yielded little to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
above the Charge of Collecting, and
the beſt of them have done great miſchief
to our Trade; Now ſeeing theſe are only ſo
many ſeveral Modus's of raiſing Money, thoſe
methods muſt doubtleſs do beſt, which leaſt
injure our Trade.</p>
            <p>3ly, The Debt due to the Tranſport-Ships
may be paid off, and thoſe People, to whoſe
early Loyalty the Reduction of <hi>Ireland</hi> is
very much owing, be contented.</p>
            <p>4ly, The Mints may be kept imployed, and
the Kingdom thereby filled with Coin.</p>
            <p>5ly, Our Wooll may be kept at home,
which I humbly conceive can never be done
till a good Credit be ſettled, any thing leſs
will not be large enough to cover the Sore
intended to be Cured.</p>
            <p>6ly, The Plantation Trade may be better
ſecured, eſpecially that of Tobacco, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
may be propoſed to render it more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
both to the King, and alſo to the
Subject.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:98649:9"/>
7ly, The Bank of <hi>Englands</hi> Notes
may be brought to Par, and Tallyes
of all ſorts in a ſhort time be paid
off at their full Valew, which I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
conceive will be difficult to be
done any other way; the ſetling a
Credit on either, or grafting them both
together, ſeem improbable Methods to
anſwer thoſe ends.</p>
            <p>I humbly hope to make Propoſals
in this preſent Seſſions for putting
theſe into Practiſe, if a good Credit
be timely ſetled.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, many other Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
will accrue to the Nation, many
of which I have ſet forth in my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
recited Eſſay on Coin and Credit.
<hi>Pag.</hi> 27, 28, 29.</p>
            <p>III. The Third thing is to make
ſome Compariſon between the Credit
here propoſed, and the preſent Bank of
<hi>England;</hi> which I Humbly conceive
is ſo ſhaken in its Reputation, as hath
rendred it uncapable to be made the
Foundation of a National Credit; and
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98649:10"/>
whilſt we labour to recover it, we
may run the hazard of deſtroying our
Trade, diſturbing the Government, and
keeping our ſelves under a lingring
War, whilſt we encourage the French
King to try his utmoſt Efforts, hoping
that our Difficulties at home will
force us to accept of a diſhonourable
Peace.</p>
            <p>'Tis certain nothing can be the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of a National Credit, which is
not better, or at leaſt ſo good as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
and this is not to be found in the
Bank of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe Notes whilſt
they are One <hi>per Cent.</hi> worſe then Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
will always keep their Coffers
empty, becauſe no Man will put into
it a Hundred Pounds in Money, when
he can have a Note of the ſame Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
for Ninety Nine; and the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
will be this, that the Lender,
or rather the Jobber, will never reſt
till he is repaid, that ſo he may be
making advantage by a New Purchaſe;
And if this will be the effect of a
Credit worſe only by One <hi>per Cent.</hi>
than Money, what will it be when 'tis
ſunk to Sixteen? Whereas on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide, when a Credit is better than
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98649:10"/>
Money, the Coffers will ever be full,
becauſe all Men will endeavour to put
in their Money, and be impatient till
'tis done; And thus it will be, when
the Lender thinks himſelf ſecure, and
makes more profit by having his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
in the Bank then in his Cheſt,
who will therefore receive out no more
at a time then his neceſſities ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
and for the ſame Reaſon, thoſe
to whom he pays it, will endeavour
to return it thither again ſo ſoon as
they can.</p>
            <p>IV. As to the Fourth thing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
The neceſſity the Nation lies
under to have its Credit ſetled this
preſent Seſſions. it will appear, if we
conſider how <hi>London</hi> now ſtands in
Competition with all <hi>England</hi> beſides
as to the Specie of Money, and how
it will ſtand before another Seſſions;
'Tis generally agreed, that about One
Moiety of the Money of <hi>England</hi> is
already Center'd in that great City,
and the reſt is not enough to pay the
Debts owing to it, together with His
Majeſties Revenues, Bonds already en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
into, and Taxes now to be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98649:11"/>
for Six Months longer, beſides the
Foreign Bills, which are generally made
payable there, all which muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
in Specie; for though by an Act
of this preſent Seſſions: Intituled, <hi>An
Act for the farther remedying the ill State
of the Coin of this Kingdom,</hi> it is among
other things Provided, That all Money
that ſhall be brought in upon Account
of Taxes, or Revenues, or Loans, at
Five Shillings and Eight Pence <hi>per</hi>
Ounce, ſhall be carryed to the next
adjacent Mint, in order to be Recoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
yet this will no way be Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Country, unleſs a Credit be
ſettled, it muſt otherwiſe be ſent up
to <hi>London</hi> after Coined for want of
Returns, the Debts due to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
being paid there in Bank, which
is Sixteen <hi>per Cent.</hi> worſe than Money,
and thoſe due from the Country de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
in Specie, ſo that the Money
of <hi>England</hi> is every Week brought up
thither; and then, if it be next conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
what Methods are left to the
Country to draw it back again, <hi>viz.</hi>
by Proviſions and ſome few other things,
'twill be reaſonable to believe, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſupply made from that City
to the Country is greater then what is
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98649:11"/>
made from the Country thither, all
the Caſh of <hi>England</hi> will Center there
in a ſhort time, to the Ruining of
the other Trading Cities, and diſabling
of the Country to pay future Taxes;
And this will make the dependance
on <hi>London</hi> ſtill greater, till by its own
Bloatineſs it muſt at laſt burſt, when
the Eſtates of the Traders ſhall conſiſt
only in Debts due from the Country,
which muſt ſtill lye out, for want of
a Specie to pay them in; ſo that all
the advantage <hi>London</hi> will receive is,
that it will be laſt Ruined.</p>
            <p>Now if a good Credit be ſettled
out of Hand, and the Mints conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in the Country, the Money that
is now there may be ſtill kept there, and
Methods found out to increaſe it, and
the Trade of <hi>England</hi> carryed on with
an equal Circulation in all places; this
will keep up the Rents of the Lands
of <hi>England,</hi> which muſt otherwiſe fall
in their Values, ſuitable to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
they ſtand in from that great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis.</p>
            <p>If it be Objected, That the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of this Credit will be very coſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98649:12"/>
to the Nation; I humbly conceive,
that the Profits thereof will not only
ſupport its Charge, but alſo bring in
a great Overplus, which may be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
imployed to the Nations advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage;
yet were this Objection true, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be termed good Husbandry
which ſpoils our Trade, the ſtopping
whereof but for one Month will be
many Millions loſt to the Kingdom;
therefore, whatever Charge is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to keep it on foot, 'twill be the
Nations Intereſt to be at, eſpecially
ſuch a Bank as this is, whoſe Profits
or Loſſes are Compatible with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of the Subject, for, if the Bank
looſes 'tis becauſe the Subject gets, and
if the Bank gets, the Nation hath the
Profits, whilſt at the ſame time the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is ſupported, and our Trade
carried on.</p>
            <p>If by rectifying this, or any better
Propoſal from a more thinking Head,
the Credit of the Nation may be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
in this preſent Seſſions, I have reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the end I aimed at, the Good and
Welfare of my Native Country;
which I Humbly ſubmit to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
great Wiſdom, and ſhall be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98649:12"/>
to explain any thing that may
ſeem doubtful, when I am thereto
Commanded.</p>
