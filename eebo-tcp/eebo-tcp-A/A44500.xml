            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A PROPOSAL humbly offered to this Honorable Houſe of Commons,</head>
            <byline>by <hi>JOHN HORNE</hi> 
               <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pholſterer, <hi>London,</hi>
            </byline>
            <argument>
               <p>to Change both the Good and Bad Moneys of this Kingdom, and to make out the want of Weight in the right Coin, and in ſo doing to Raiſe the King, near Two Millions of Money; And alſo to cauſe a Free and open Trade amongſt our ſelves, and that every Perſon ſhall make <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe as well of his bad Moneys as his Good, until his bad Money hath waſted it ſelf quite away, as we humbly conceive may be in a ten Years and much Eaſier for the People to loſe 20 <hi>S.</hi> in 40 Weeks, than to loſe it in one Day, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> humbly Refer'd to the Wiſdom of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable Houſe.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>To Demonſtrate the Methods how to Change the Moneys, is thus;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Imprimis, A.</hi> BRingeth 10 <hi>l.</hi> in Moneys to be Chang'd, the good being pickt out, amounts to but 7 <hi>l.</hi> in Tale, which 7 <hi>l.</hi> being weigh'd, amounts to but 5 <hi>l.</hi> which 5 <hi>l.</hi> be given to <hi>A.</hi> in Mill'd Moneys; and for his 2 <hi>l.</hi> that his 7 <hi>l.</hi> wanted in Weight, and his 3 <hi>l.</hi> of <hi>Falſe Moneys,</hi> which makes 5 <hi>l.</hi> be given to <hi>A.</hi> upon a Tally, which Tally of 5 <hi>l.</hi> and 5 <hi>l. A.</hi> before Received in Ready Moneys, makes <hi>A.</hi> up his 10 <hi>l.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and to be ſuppoſed to be much better ſatisfied with a Tally for his Moneys, which he may then go to Market with again, then totally to Loſe his 3 <hi>l.</hi> of bad Moneys, which he took in Trade as ſo much Good; and no doubt but <hi>A.</hi> had rather Loſe this 3 <hi>l</hi> by little and little, than altogether, and leſs hurt it will do him; And that every ſuch Tally paſs even as for ſo much Ready Moneys, and in ſo doing we have a free Trade; for we are ſure we ſhall not Loſe the bad <hi>Moneys,</hi> if we take it for our Goods, tho' we will be as Cautious as may be how we take it, by reaſon we will have as ſmall a Tally as we can; This, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive ſheweth, That the bad <hi>Moneys</hi> may be Changed as well as the <hi>Good,</hi> and at the ſame Charge.</p>
            <p>II. As to Raiſing the King Two Millions of Moneys in ſo doing, and to ſhew that there will be a ſpeedy conſumption of theſe Tallies, is thus; Every time a Tally is Paid, Receiv'd, Bought, or Sold, it muſt Loſe Four Pence in every Pound; that is, Two Pence to the King, which muſt be Indorſed on the Tally, every time it is ſo Paid, Receiv'd, Bought, or Sold; and the other 2 ſunk, that is thus, <hi>viz. A.</hi> comes with his Tally of 5 <hi>l.</hi> and pays it to <hi>B.</hi> he being ſo much Indebted to him and gives <hi>B.</hi> 1 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> more than his Debt, which is all the Loſs <hi>A.</hi> doth receive by putting off his Tally of 5 <hi>l.</hi> which is 1 <hi>s</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> that <hi>A.</hi> gave to <hi>B.</hi> Half of it was ſunk, and Half was for the King; which Half for the King, <hi>A.</hi> takes Care to Indorſe upon the Tally, then <hi>B.</hi> pays the ſaid Tally to <hi>C.</hi> which then wants 10 <hi>d.</hi> of 5 <hi>l.</hi> which 10 <hi>d. A.</hi> gave <hi>B</hi> before, to make good his Payment, when he ſhould come to pay it, which 10 <hi>d. B.</hi> gives alſo to <hi>C.</hi> to make up his Five Pounds, and gives <hi>C.</hi> alſo 1 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> more; as <hi>A.</hi> did to him, which is all that <hi>B.</hi> Loſeth alſo by Paſſing the ſaid Tally; and B. alſo takes Care to Indorſe 10 <hi>d.</hi> upon the Tally, which 10 <hi>d.</hi> ſtill given, <hi>C.</hi> that takes the Tally with the 10 <hi>d.</hi> that <hi>A.</hi> alſo gave to <hi>B.</hi> which makes then in the Hands of <hi>C.</hi> 1 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> for the King, and 1 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> ſunk off of the ſaid Tally; which 1 <hi>s.</hi> and 8 <hi>d.</hi> is ſtill handed along with the Tally, and alſo the reſt of the Indorſements; and all the Indorſements are always left in his Hand that hath the Tally, until they amount to Twenty Shillings; which Tally when its Indorſements hath once amounted to Twenty Shillings ſhall no more paſs in Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment until Renew'd, which will then have juſt gone thorow the Alphabet, and have come into <hi>A</hi>'s Hand again; then <hi>A.</hi> muſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry this Tally of 5 <hi>l.</hi> to the Office, and give them the 20 <hi>s.</hi> of Indorſments which are for the Uſe of the King, and take a new Tally of 4 <hi>l.</hi> and ſet that to work again. Now I ſaid it would Raiſe Two Millions to the King; but I hope by this time this Honorable Houſe doth plainly ſee, that it will make all the bad <hi>Moneys,</hi> and the want of Weight in the good <hi>Money,</hi> become all Good to the King, which is ſuppoſed to be nearer Four Millions than Two. Now, if this Honorable Houſe ſhall not think fit to Raiſe any thing upon the bad <hi>Moneys</hi> to the King, then it will be waſted away the ſooner; but ſince there muſt be <hi>Moneys</hi> Raiſed, I humbly conceive the People would rather Pay it thus, and make uſe of their bad <hi>Moneys</hi> to the very laſt, than to Loſe their bad <hi>Moneys</hi> All at once, and Raiſe ſo much <hi>Moneys</hi> for the King beſides.</p>
            <p>III. How this may be done, and we continue Trading one with another all the time our <hi>Moneys</hi> is a Changing. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there be a Grand Office in this City of <hi>London,</hi> call'd, <hi>The Tally-Office</hi>; and that at the Place where the <hi>Moneys</hi> is Changed, no Tallies be given, but an Order to the <hi>Tally-Office,</hi> to give <hi>A.</hi> a Tally for 5 <hi>l.</hi> more or leſs, Mark'd or Stampt, for ſuch a County, as <hi>A.</hi> ſhall deſire it; and that no Tally paſs out of the County it is Mark'd for; and that no Tally paſs in any County, till there be an Office fixt in the ſaid County.</p>
            <p>For the Convenience of Trade, how to make a Tally Payable in any County in <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Wales</hi>; thus <hi>A.</hi> hath Tallies by him of a Hundred Pounds, <hi>A.</hi> wants to pay a Hundred in <hi>B</hi>'s County; <hi>A.</hi> muſt go to the Office of his own County, and give up his Tallies of Hundred Pounds, and ſee them Struck out, and take an Order from the Maſter of the Office in his own County, to the Maſter of the Office of <hi>B</hi>'s County, to give to <hi>A.</hi> Tallies for a Hundred Pounds, and Number them with the ſame Number that <hi>A</hi>'s Tallies was Numbred with before; and for ſo doing <hi>A.</hi> ſhall Allow 2 <hi>d.</hi> or 3 <hi>d.</hi> in the Pound to the King, according to the Diſtance of the Place.</p>
            <p>IV. That every County Change their <hi>Moneys</hi> diſtinctly one after another; and that ſo ſoon as every County ſhall begin to Change their <hi>Moneys,</hi> there be an Office Erected in the ſame, as well for Suppreſſing the Falſifying ſuch Tallies, as for the Return of <hi>Moneys,</hi> tho' we humbly conceive a Tally cannot well be Falſified; however it is but the Receiver's Trouble going with, or ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tally offer'd him in Payment to the Office to Prove it; which, if Falſe, then he that offer'd ſuch Tally, to be Puniſhed according to the Great Wiſdom of this Houſe.</p>
            <p>V. That every Pariſh Change their <hi>Moneys</hi> diſtinctly, to avoid Confuſions, and that they have timely Notice to bring in the ſame; and that every Conſtable, and Beadle of ſuch Pariſh Attend their Pariſhioners at the Place of Change during ſuch Time, the better to find out ſuch as have ſo metamorphis'd the Coin of this Kingdom, and for the Ptomoting of Trade, that the Old <hi>Moneys</hi> go ſtill in every ſuch County after they have ſo Changed, provided it be Good until they are call'd upon a ſecond Time, for it is ſuppoſed that one County Trades with another; And after <hi>A</hi>'s County hath Changed their <hi>Moneys,</hi> in the mean time</p>
            <p>
               <hi>C</hi>'s County muſt Trade with <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>C</hi>'s County having not yet Change, by conſequence can neither have Tally nor New Moneys; ſo that <hi>A</hi>'s County muſt ſtill take <hi>C</hi>'s <hi>Moneys,</hi> till the whole Alphabet hath Changed; and then when <hi>A.</hi> is Call'd a ſecond Time, it is to be ſuppoſed that every County is furniſhed either with new Money or Tallies, and then <hi>A</hi>'s County ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a ſecond time, refuſe any Old <hi>Moneys,</hi> if <hi>C</hi>'s County comes to Trade with <hi>A</hi>'s let them then either bring forth their New <hi>Moneys,</hi> or Return their Tallies. Now hoping that I have made it very Plain and Eaſie to Change the <hi>Moneys</hi> of this Kingdom, and ſo continue a Free Trade Now it is convenient to take ſome Care, that the King be not cheated of his Due, which I humbly conceive muſt be thus;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there be a Penalty Laid upon all Perſons paying ſuch Tally or Tallies; That they take Care to Indorſe Summ or Summs, as doth amount to the King thereby.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That there be a Penalty Laid upon all ſuch Perſon or Perſons, in whoſe hands thoſe Tallies ſhall be, when their Indorſements are amounted to Twenty Shillings, That they forthwith bring in the ſame to the Office to be Renewed, and pay in their Indorſements to the Office for the Uſe of the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That when any ſuch Tally ſhall have waſted it ſelf away to Twenty Shillings, that is 4 <hi>l.</hi> out of the Five, that the Maſter of the Office, where ſuch Tally ſhall come, do give to the Owner thereof 19 <hi>s.</hi> for 20 in Ready Moneys, and be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd to add the 20 <hi>s.</hi> he hath ſo Bought, to the next Tally that comes to be Renew'd; and that the Owner of that Tally to whom the 20 <hi>s.</hi> is added, do give the Maſter of the Office 20 <hi>s.</hi> in Ready Moneys for the 20 <hi>s.</hi> he hath ſo added to his Tally; alſo that no Tally paſs in Payment under 20 <hi>s.</hi> by reaſon the Poor ſhall not be Burdened with them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That when the Tallies of <hi>A</hi>'s County are all waſted away to 20 <hi>s.</hi> that the Office give <hi>A.</hi> 20 <hi>s.</hi> for his Tally, and that it be the King's Loſs; and then that the Office break up, and no more Tallies paſs in that County.</p>
            <p>How to find out that they are alſo waſted, and that none come after the Office is broke up, is thus; That the Sherriff of the County at the Requeſt of the Maſter of the <hi>Office,</hi> do ſend to every Pariſh to give them Notice, if they have any Tallies left, to bring them to the <hi>Office</hi> of the County, and by ſuch a Day, or elſe ſtand to their own Loſs, that when ſuch Pariſh hath Notice from the Sheriff, that they receive it publickly In the Church.</p>
