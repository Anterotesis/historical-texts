         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that our faith may bee set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

according to the Analogie,

but onely the Euangelicall

nor any other rocke to builde

other City of refuge, to flie

which as Dauid sayth, is a
Lampe vnto our pathes for

<pb facs="tcp:5690:16"/>
sayth, in darkenesse for our

from the ponderous, sayth S.
<hi>Augustine,</hi> a touch stone for

to discern the curre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t

all sufficiencie for our ful sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,
and the onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoyment
of all controuersies
for our resolution wee shall
doe well. This being added,
that we pray earnestly with
<hi>Dauid, That God would
open our eies that we may

Otherwise, they that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyted

            <p>These thinges beeing so,
what meanes the cursed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignants
of our Church of
England to trouble mens

whence many monsters of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,
and thousand of fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
doe dayly arise, which
entangle the simple in many

where was your Church hid

or on what day was it hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?
What age did the Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<pb facs="tcp:5690:17"/>
What is become of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers?
These and the like
interrogatories are as intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
and preambles to
insnare and entangle the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

and quiddities. As if <hi>Petrus
Valdus Lugdunensis, Iohn
Wicleefe, Husse, Luther,</hi>
and others such reformers,
did at any time endeauour to

Church, whereas the truth
is, they onely diligently labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by the word of God, and
by the power thereof, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
that Church, which by
mens traditions and deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes,
was most miserably de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
and defaced, and to
reduce it to its former splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor,

Sister. And doubtlesse wee
know many pious and chaste
Matrones, who iustly may be
ashamed of their owne sisters
enormious courses, and exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
conditions. Neyther
did they vse any other means
in seeking reformation, but
by yeelding onely, and lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
sayd, <hi>Oh how is that
faithfull City become an
harlot? It was full of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and iustice lodged
therein, but now they are
murtherers. Thy siluer, O

For these and the like impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
consideratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s of the great
defect, miserable reuolt, and

<pb facs="tcp:5690:18"/>
but to reproue them

branded with the names
of <hi>Waldenses, Wicklefia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>s,

other the like disgracefull
tearmes, as if they had beene
Nouelists, because they tolde
the truth, God forbidde?
<hi>George Cassander</hi> the
choyce diuine of his time said
well and iuditiously, when he
gaue his sentence of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentions
of the Church, both
to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>
the Emperours, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
that in the beginning
many were iustly stirred vp
by a godly zeale, earnestly to
reproue, and reforme some
appara<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>t abuses in the church,
and that the principall cause
<pb facs="tcp:5690:19"/>
of the Churches calamity,
and distraction, was not to
bee imputed to those who
sought reformation, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to such as ruled the stern,
who beeing puffed vp with
disdaine, and scorned to be
rebuked, proudly, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily
despised, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayned
those that modestly,
meekely, and iustly did but
admonish and aduertise
them.</p>
            <p>And hee thought that
there could bee no firme, nor
constant concord in the
Church, vnlesse they bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne
to reforme, who
first gaue the occasion of
distraction, to witte, that
those of the Churches Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement
must abate theyr
rough rigor and sternnes, &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:5690:19"/>
yeeld somewhat for the peace
of the church, and by liste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to the petitions, and
counsels of many godly and
well disposed men, should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme
the apparent errors
and abuses crept into the
church, and conforme them
according to the rule of Gods
word and the primitiue
integritie from which they
were in many things decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>If the case were come to
this, who would not embrace
that sacred peace of the
church wherewith the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gells
of heauen congratula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
mankinde in the incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
which Christ left
as his legacie to his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
people when hee was to

forsake the world, and the
Apostles as their principall
doctrine enioyned to the
Christian Church.</p>
            <p>Euery one (you say) is
ready for peace, but what if
we cannot haue it? <hi>Then
must we make peace</hi> as
Saint <hi>Iames</hi> speaks) by our
diligence, by our sufferance.
What if wee make peace once,
and it depart? <hi>Then must
wee follow peace</hi> (as <hi>Paule</hi>
commands.) What if it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon
vs (<hi>Peter</hi> wisheth

What if it will not come? (as

sought it and ensued it? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
then must wee studie to bee

            <p>For what good Christian
<pb facs="tcp:5690:20"/>
is not of worthy <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi>

And of <hi>Iouians</hi> who sayd this

I hate contentions

            <p>Oh what hellish furie hath
enraged the malignant

            <p>But this <hi>Godlinesse</hi> is the

            <p>This then indeede is a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:5690:54"/>
incomprehensible
mistery, that thus God should
bee manifested in our weake

should be in one person. And
that of the same God, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Scripture should say, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of this his manifestation

               <hi>Before</hi> Abraham <hi>was

And further in respect
of the vnion of both natures
in the person of the Sonne of

<hi>That God redeemed his Church

               <note place="margin">1. Ioh. 3.</note> So
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:5690:55"/>
that the Catholike conclusion
of all, is this, That Christ Iesus
Emanuel consisting of two
distinct Natures in the person
of the Sonne of God, without
confusion was incarnate, and
became our Mediator, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to both Natures, that the
same hand that wrought the
institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> of the world, should
also worke the restitution of
the same: For it was impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that the World should be
saued without the Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Sonne of God: For
God in Christ reconciled the
world vnto himselfe: And by
taking vnto himself our flesh
by Incarnation, made it his
owne flesh, that so of his own
(albeit from vs) hee might
haue what to offer to God for
vs.</p>
            <p>And without this our
flesh hee could not suffer, for
the manhood is the proper
subiect of passion, compassion
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:5690:55"/>
and feeling pitty, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the regiment of Christes
Kingdome to bee most ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
exercising dominion o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
all men, with a true, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
and sensible touch of
mercy<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g>
            </p>
            <p>The second person there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of the glorious Trinitie;
was sent to performe this
great worke: not the Father,
who being of none, could not
be sent: Not the holy Ghost,
who albeit he proceed, yet he
is not the first that procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth:
And forasmuch as a
double <hi>Mission</hi> was requisite,
the first person that procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,
was fittest for the first
<hi>Mission,</hi> and the second for the
second, who also more fitte,
to make vs the sonnes of God
by grace, then hee that was
the sonne of God by nature:
And who more fit to repaire
the images decayed in vs, then
he that was the engraue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g> form
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:5690:56"/>
of his Fathers person. And
this was done that man with
more assurance, and without
danger of euer erring, might
come neare vnto the presence
of sacred truth it selfe, and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
therein by this manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Sonne of God.
And God became man, that
he whom man was to follow,
might shew himselfe vnto
man, and bee seene of him.
Besides it was done, that the
humane nature might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced
to such an high digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and excellencie, that no
man should any more so
much forget himselfe, as to
defile the same with sinfull
impurities. Lastly, it was done
that man might bee deliuered
from the slauery and bondage
of sinne, whereinto hee was
plunged; For man was puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
as <hi>Iustice vrged:</hi> That
was p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>rformed which God
had threatned, as <hi>Truth</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:5690:56"/>
The offender was
pittied as <hi>Mercy</hi> entreated, &amp;
<hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> reconciled, as
<hi>Peace</hi> desired. Thus <hi>Mercie
and Truth met together, Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse
and Peace kissed each
other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The manner of this is the
astonishment of Heauen, and

makes it more true then plain

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:5690:57"/>
triall of our faith. For this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation
of God in the flesh
is to vnbeleeuers as the cloud
that stood betwixt the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites
and the Egyptians at the
red sea, which to the Israelites
was a bright shining cloud,
but to the Egyptians a dark,

Commet.</p>
            <p>And is not this then a <hi>Great
Mysterie?</hi> That God, who
is without beginning and
end, should haue a beginning
with vs by birth, and an end
by death. That God who nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
changeth nor altereth,
should encrease in stature:
That God who is without
commixture or defect, should
eate and bee an hungry. That
God who could be no more
then he was, should take vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
him the shape of a seruant, &amp;
be that he was not, that could
haue no more then hee had,
should bee lesse then he was,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:5690:58"/>
and could know no more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
he knew, and yet would feele
our infirmities, and taste our
miseries. What tongue, what
pen can expresse this myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie?
that God should bee vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
vnto man, not onely in
loue &amp; grace, but in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son:
for we must obserue that
the humane nature of Christ
is not a distinct person by it
selfe, as <hi>Peter, Iohn,</hi> and such
like, but to our vnspeakeable
comfort is so vnited to the
diuine nature that did assume
it, as they both make but one
person: so that all that is in it,
is truly said to be Gods, and al
that was don by it, to be done
by God, as Christs bloud was
Gods bloud, Christs death
was Gods death, as hath been
sayd. And the God of glorie
may as well be sayd to suffer
death, as to rayse the dead fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>

               <hi>That thou

with any the least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iudice
or impeachment of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquitie,

that, which was in his

the humane nature. So
S. <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth the Church
of <hi>Rome,</hi> affirming, that albeit
hee was the sonne of <hi>Dauid</hi>
according to the flesh, yet
was hee declared to bee the
Sonne of God, with power
according to the <hi>Spirit of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,</hi>

               <hi>by the resurrection

vnto mee to intend two ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
to this purpose. The
first is, that neuer any in our
flesh liued spotlesse, and voide
of sinne, but Christ onely.
There is the iustifying Spirite
of Sanctification.</p>
            <p>The second is, that neuer

Iesus loosed the bandes of

the <hi>Iustifying Spirite of</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
in the Resurrection; and
euen in this very phrase <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanasins</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:5690:72"/>

            </p>
            <p>To this end, that he should
bee honoured and worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
not as a meere man, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit
hee was truly man, but
as the eternall God in our
flesh. This therefore is the
Catholique Faith which,
whosoeuer doth not beleeue,
cannot bee saued. That Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ is knowne by his
power in the spirite, to be the
very son of God against the

that hee was God of

against the <hi>Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:5690:73"/>
This Iustification of the
Sonne of God was declared
in the spirit of power, and in
the spirite of purity, as I haue
sayde out of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> to the
Romanes.</p>
            <p>In the power of the Spirit
it was declared against al the
powers of darkenesse, which

For besides the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall

            <p>His Iustification was also

most notably and most noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
the Iustification of the

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:5690:74"/>
appeareth most euidently, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
at this day to the viewe
of the whole christian world,
in his continued iudgements
vpon the whole nation of the
Iewes, who were subuerted,
and vtterly ouerthrowne by
the Romans, at the very time
of the yeare wherein they
crucified Christ, which was
about Easter: For at that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

so from that Mou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t was their
City entered, and surprised:
And as they hurried the
Lord Iesus from <hi>Pilate</hi> to
<hi>Herod;</hi> so they were hurried
vp and downe during the
siege, from <hi>Iohn</hi> to <hi>Simeon,</hi> and

And as they whipped the

in despicable maner, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and scorne; Euen so
they were whipped vp and
downe the holy City in great
villany and reproach by the

            <p>And as the Lord Iesus was

by <hi>Iudas</hi> a Iew; euen so
thirty of the Iewes in the sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

the hand of Gods power to

is not shortned, but stretched
out against them still.</p>

            <p>In a word tell me, who
did euer striue against the

band himselfe against Christ,
or Christian, and was not
confounded? Christ was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
iustified by the spirit of san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
puritie; beeing pure,
and spotlesse in himselfe, both
in body and soule, for there
was not any guile in him, and
also pure in his redeemed peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple
effectually. In himselfe
pure, his conception pure by
the holy Ghost, his birth pure
of a Virgin, his life pure, both
in word and deed, in life and
death pure, for hee offended
not, no not so much as in his
tongue, and he is perfect that
so offendeth not.</p>
            <p>In his redeemed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:5690:80"/>
that scoffe at the gifts of the
Spirite in their brethren, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to those whom they see
reuearing, and yeelding o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
to the power of
Gods grace, and counselling
others to be guided &amp; gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
thereby. <hi>Oh Sir, you are
so full of the spirite that it runs
out of your nose. Oh sir, the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
moueth you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This and the like hellish
language, I say, is an amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
vnto good men, to
thinke there should be any fo
damnably prophane, and so
desperately wicked, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
among Christians, who
professe in their holy Creede,
to beleeue in the holy spirite,
and acknowledge that in the
power of that spirit, <hi>They liue,
moue,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act 16.</note> 
               <hi>and haue their being,</hi> yea
and they feele themselues
oft times quickned from the
dulnesse of sinne by the same
spirit, vnto the motion, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:5690:81"/>
life of grace,<note place="margin">Rom. 2.</note> wherby they are
made vnexcusable.</p>
            <p>And professe further,
that they beleeue that they
shall bee raysed vppe out
of their dust, and from
the bands and fetters of the
graue, by the operation of
this powerfull and blessed
spirite vnto eternall glory, by
that mighty working where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
it is able to subdue all<note place="margin">Phil. 3.</note>
things vnto it selfe.</p>
            <p>This (I say) is a great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation
and amazement
vnto a Christian heart, and
causeth oft times many good
soules to quake and shudder
to see, and behold such despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
scornings, and reprochful
contumelies among such, as
professe they beleeue in
God.</p>
            <p>The serious considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof (I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
would eftsoones
trouble the mindes of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:5690:81"/>
other, with grieuous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions
and disturbances,
had not the holy booke of
God in two most pregnant
places of the new Testament,
set foorth to the life, both of
the Apostacie of faith, and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity
of good manners,
which the spirit of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesyeth
should happen in
these last and worst ages of
the world. For Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
teacheth the Bishoppe of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesus,</hi>
That the spirite spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
euidently,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 1.</note> 
               <hi>That in the
latter times some shall depart
from the faith, and shall giue
heede to spirites of error, and
doctrines of Diuels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The spirites of error are
such, in whome there is no
sound trueth of GOD,
but mingled and mangled
with humane traditions,
no conscience of good, but
iustifyings of their owne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:5690:82"/>The doctrines of diuels
are prohibitions of marriage,
and superstitious abstaining
from meates, as the Text spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth,
And I take those spirits
of errors, and doctrines of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels,
are no where to be fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>d
in the Christian Church
more pregnant, for we must
not looke for them among
Turkes and Pagans, because
this Prophesie reuealeth what
shall happen in the Church,
and amongst professors of
Christ, but in the Papacy on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
which in the later times,
that is, some sixe hundred
yeares agoe, or thereaboutes,
vtterly fell away from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of the faith of Christ, and
gaue heede to the spirites of
errors, &amp; doctrines of diuels,
intending nothing else there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
but the subuersion of the
Primitiue purity of Religion,
and conuersion of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
beauty of the Church of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:5690:82"/>
Christ, into an externall, and
pompous lustre of humane
policie.</p>
            <p>And againe Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
sheweth by the euidence of
the same spirite,<note place="margin">2. Tim. 3.</note> 
               <hi>That in the
last dayes,</hi> which are these
worst dayes of ours, <hi>should
come perillous times, wherein
men should bee louers of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues,
couetous boasters, proud,
cursed speakers, disobedient to
parents, vnthankefull, vnholy,
without naturall affections, truce
breakers, false accusers, intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate,
fierce, no louers at all
of them that are good, traytors,
beady, high minded, louers of
pleasure more then of God, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
a shew of Godlinesse, but
haue denied the power thereof,
from which Saint</hi> Paul <hi>counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
to turne away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>These (Men and Breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren)
These, I say, are the
faithlesse and fruitlesse spirites
of vanity, the dissolute chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:5690:83"/>
of disobedience, and
cloudes without water, who
despite the spirite of grace,
<hi>Quench the light of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 19.</note>
and know not whether
there bee an holy Ghost or
no.</p>
            <p>But (Men and Brethren)
Hearken, whosoeuer offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
of infirmity, offendeth
against God the Father, who
is power and strength, and
whosoeuer offendeth of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
sinneth against God
the Sonne, who is wisedome,
and these finnes are pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
but who so sinneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Holy Ghost, the
spirite of truth and charity,
his sinnes are irremisible.</p>
            <p>Let him therefore that
hath an eare, heare what the
Spirite sayth vnto the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches:
For the Spirites of the
Prophets are subiect to the
Prophetes. <hi>Bee men neuer
so profoundly learned, or so
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:5690:83"/>
well conceyted of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Christ Iesus who was our
Reconciliation on earth, by
his Incarnation, Life, and
Passion, is now our Aduo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
in heauen, at the right
hand of God the Father, by
his continual Mediation, and
is our dayly Comforter, (as
Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> speaketh) by

and our wils, and conscien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to the obedience of faith,
and to the endeauour, care

Are not they then in a

this Reconciliation, Aduoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

that can doe them, or theirs
any good who resist the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
of Christ, albeit it stand
at the dore of their hearts and

who grieue the spirite
of God by their vile and
beastlie liuing, and quench
out the light thereof by their
ouer-flowings of malitious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
which otherwise would
shine and glitter, like the spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles

and in a word, who haue in

qualitie, sparke or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance
of Gods spirite
whatsoeuer they may brag,
and boast thereof, out of their
owne deceiueable seemings,
but only this, that their good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
so Anabaptistically are
they besotted, cannot be seen
as the holy Ghost is inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.</p>
            <p>And no lesse lamentable
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:5690:84"/>
are the cauils of those which
obiect, That the Iesuites
(whom wee so vilifie) boast
also that they are led by the
spirite, as if most damnable
heretiques did not make the
same plea; but the practise of
the Nobles of <hi>Baroa</hi> is a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
answere for that, and
all other cauils of that frie: for
they searched the Scriptures:<note place="margin">Act. 17.</note>
               <hi>To see whether or no the thinges
were so that they heard the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles
preach; but the spirite of
Iesuitisme</hi> dare not abide that
triall, nor any other like spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of error.</p>
            <p>Another saith, there bee so
manie that vaunte of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
that I knowe not which I
should adhere vnto, but <hi>Saint
Paul</hi> giueth a rule for that.
<hi>Neuerthelesse</hi> (saith he) <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto

Let vs march by the same rule,</hi>

               <hi>(which is the sacred Scriptures)
that wee may minde the same

thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This plainely sheweth vs,
that we must adhere to none,
for our direction to God, but
such as adhere to Gods Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,
the Sacred scriptures, and
are guided thereby.</p>
            <p>Yea, but another vrgeth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(and saith) wee see that
those that professe themselues
to bee guided by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and by the spirit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
doe differ. What then? <hi>All
men haue not Faith, albeit in
number and profession they be of
the Church,</hi> (as <hi>S. Austine</hi> spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth:)
&amp; hence it is that they
cannot accord: For what

Yea, euen amongst
them that haue Faith, some
haue a greater, and some a
lesser portion thereof, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their knowledge, by
Gods dispensation: &amp; hence
it is oft times that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:5690:85"/>
accord in all things, at all
times, for there is a processi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p>Vnto naturall sight three
things are required. First the
power of seeing, then the
light, as the meanes of seeing,
and a visible forme for the
obiect.</p>
            <p>To this intellectual, Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall
knowledge or fight are
three things also requisite.</p>
            <p>First, their intellectuall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
of knowledge giuen the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì„</g>
by their Creator in their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
then the reflection of
Gods light, as the meanes of
their knowledge, and the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
body of Christ Iesus as
the visible obiect to delight
them.</p>
            <p>The knowledge then
of Angells is twofold, the
one naturall whereby they
see, and know God in the
vndeuided Trinitie (to wit)
the Father, Sonne, and holy
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:5690:95"/>
Ghost) one in essence, and
three in existence, and all
the creatures of God in this
blessed vision.</p>
            <p>The other knowledge of
things is two fold: First, by
a matutine knowledge, as
Saint <hi>Angustiue</hi> calleth it,
knowing, and seeing all
things in the <hi>Word,</hi> by whom
all things were made, and
afterwards by a view of the
creatures in themselues. For
the Angells see the creatures
in God, and men see God in
the creatures.</p>
            <p>Playnely thus, <hi>Euclides,
Archimides,</hi> or some such like
skilfull Mathematitian, first
seeth, and knoweth the
length, and breadth, and
all the demensions of the
lines, and euery turning,
tryangle, and particular
parcell of his draught and
circle in his minde and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:5690:95"/>
cogitation, and afterwardes
seeth and knoweth the same
lines, angles, and Circles,
in the table, dust or earth,
wherein hee draweth those
proportions; semblably the
Angels see, and know all
things reuealed vnto them:
First in God, and then in the
Creatures; in God, as in their
mindes, in the Creatures, as in
the reuealed obiects, For
Angels haue a naturall know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
wherein they were
created, euen as many as
continued their stations in
the truth and seruice of their
Creator, and they haue also

            <p>This was the condition of

            <p>Hence the holy ones of

<hi>Ieremie</hi> sayth, <hi>The word

in his hand, and so their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
become powerfull.</p>
            <p>But cursed Cauillers, like
<hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres,</hi> who
withstood <hi>Moses,</hi> stand vp,
and obiect.</p>
            <p>Wee confesse (say they)
this is most true, if God take
this businesse into his hand:
But alas, we see this practise
of preaching is in the hand, &amp;
handling of many a sinnefull
man, such as are oft times
more enormious, and exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant
in their conuersations,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:5690:120"/>
then those that are no Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers.</p>
            <p>Well, what then? The
word preached eyther by a
good or bad man remayneth
the Word of God still. For
if the wordes of the scripture
reade, or Preached bee but a
meere and deade letter, why
is it called the Spirite of
God?</p>
            <p>And when wee preach, if
it bee but the sound of a
mans voyce onely, why doth
God vpbraid the world <hi>That</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prou. 6.</note>
               <hi>hee hath called</hi> (when men
haue but preached) <hi>and yet ye
haue refused, and why doe the

                  </gap>ulcate
so often in all their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.</hi>
Thus sayeth the Lord
of Hosts, when notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
the Prophets onely in
the voyces of men, spake, and
preached vnto the people.</p>
            <p>Yea, but sayth a second:
If it were Gods worke, it
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:5690:120"/>
would not bee fruitlesse, and
vneffectuall in the issue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
As if that were not as good
seed which fel among thorns
as that which fell on good
ground? and as if <hi>Paul</hi> did
not testifie, <hi>That to some Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
is the oder of Life, vnto
life, and vnto some the sauour of
death vnto death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And Euangelicall <hi>Esay</hi> tels

it to bring forth and budde,
that it may giue seede to the sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
and breade to him that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth.
So shall my Word bee,
that goeth out of my mouth, it
shall not returne vnto me voyde,
but it shall accomplish that which
I will, and it shall prosper in the
thing, whereto<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> I sent it,</hi> sayeth
the Lord God almighty. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is this all, for a third puts
in his obiection, and sayeth:
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:5690:121"/>
If indeed <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> did
preach, there were no doubt
to be made of the happie issue
thereof. I answere,</p>

            <p>If a true beleeuer prosper
in the worke of his handes, he

his dearest children are

            <p>And thus hauing past the
day, recalling to mind Gods
great mercies, recounting his
owne many and manifold
infirmities and imperfections,
magnifieth Gods fauours in
all, craueth pardon for his
great vnthankefulnesse, and
so reposing himselfe in bedde
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:5690:147"/>
in his Sepulchre, hauing now
made, as it were, his last will

a stranger, and Pilgrime

and beleeuing that the time
will come, that as he is awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
and riseth from bedde
in the morning: so shall he
bee raysed from his graue,
and sleepe of death, to
liue with GOD in Christe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally.</p>
            <p>But the vnbeleeuers and
fruitles professors in their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
are quite contrary. For
their awaking is to euill, and
that is euer present with
them. Their morning Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
is cursing and swearing,
and that shall distill one day
into their bowels as water, &amp;
like oyle into their bones.</p>
            <p>Their vocation is to bee
busie bodies in other mens
matters. Their society is to
seeke out the riotous
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:5690:148"/>
to runne with them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse,
their retirednesse is to

            <p>If these prosper, no man is

their disdaine, their curiosity,
their statelinesse. If they bee
afflicted, the whole Countrie
shall ring of their impatience,
murmuring, rauing and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie.</p>
            <p>And thus hauing lost the
day, they couch themselues in
their beds of beastlinesse at
night; as if they had made
a couenant with death, and
the diuell neuer to be good;

               </gap>gels, by celestiall vision,

            <p>Goe (I say) from his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie
in the flesh to his diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
a glimpse whereof was
seene in his transfiguration
on the mount, from his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
on the crosse in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation,
to his power in his
resurrection, from his mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
in respect of his Father,
to their qualitie in the height
of glory. Not that the deitie
in his ascent could bee exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:5690:161"/>
but that our nature in the
person of the Sonne of God
was first raysed vp from the
dead, and then receiued vp in
to euerlasting glory.</p>
            <p>When therefore we reade
that Christ was receyued vp
by a cloude, wee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
the cloudes of obsequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse,
not any helpe it
afforded him (as the fierie
chariot did <hi>Elias</hi>) wee
conceaue the clouds seruice,
not any ayde it yeelded,
the cloudes ministery not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
assistance that it occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned.</p>
            <p>For the matter or subiect
that ascended, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>â€¢</desc>
               </gap>properly
the humane nature of Christ,
for the deitie is neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned
in place, nor subiect
to motion.</p>
            <p>So the auncient Fathers
spake, <hi>The Sonne of God had of
ours whereby hee hanged on the
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:5690:162"/>
crosse, and of his owne, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he ascended into heauen.</hi> For
the humane nature ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
and the ascent was
wrought through the power
of the diuine nature.</p>
            <p>And this is the cause that
<hi>Tertullian</hi> calleth Iesus the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questrator
of God and man,
for of either party he had, that
was committed vnto him,
and he keepeth the pledge of
the flesh in himselfe the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
of all mankinde. For as he
hath left vnto vs the earnest
of the spirit, so he hath taken
from vs the earnest of the
flesh, &amp; carryed it into heauen
as a pledge of the whole fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
which hereafter shall bee
brought thither also.</p>
            <p>Thus is Christ our trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in heauen, and assured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
where our treasure is, there
will our hearts be also.</p>

let vs follow him in heart,
where hee is in body, let
vs follow him with paces of

            <p>And the father of a great

into a farre country about his

            <p>So Christ himselfe testifies,<note place="margin">Ioh. 14.</note>
               <hi>That vnlesse he depart the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter

            <p>Wee may also hence per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
