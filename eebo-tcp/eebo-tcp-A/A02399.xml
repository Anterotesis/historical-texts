            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Han Pericles had
gathered an armye,
makyng expedition
towardes the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle
of Pelopone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,
whan his nauy
was ready rygged,
and at the poynte to
launche forthe, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daynly
there chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
so great a darknes through an Eclips
of the Sunne, that the daye was as dark
as yf it had bene nyght, in so muche that
the starres appered: at whiche so sodayne
and prodigious a wonder the Pylote be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
amased and affrayed, as were also di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of the souldyers, refused to sayle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
farther. Whiche whan Pericles per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued,
whether it were in contempte of
Astronomye, or to encorage his astonished
souldyers, be toke his cloke and blynded
there with, the Maryners eyes: and at
the last vncouering them agayne, he asked
hym yf he thought it any wonder because
his eyes had be couered a whyle, and yet
were neuer the worse therfore. And whan
the Pylote answered that it was not: No
more is it (sayde Pericles) althoughe the
Moone shadowyng the Su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, take away
<pb facs="tcp:692:5"/>
his lyght for a season. And so contemning
a good admonicion sent as than by god, he
sayled forwarde, to the destruction of hys
souldyers, besydes the great detriment of
all the whole lande of Brecia.</p>
            <p>In lyke maner there be manye nowe a
dayes, which as Pericles despysed Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomye,
despyse all other sciences: deuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng
proper toyes (as he dyd) to dasshe
them out of countenaunce, tunnyng head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng
through Ignoraunce, into contempt
of all good learnyng: Not only inuentyng
tryfelyng toyed, but also wrestyng the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
scriptures whiche they vnderstand not
to serue for their pyuish purpose. For yf it
chaunce them to be improued with any of
the good sayinges of the auncient philoso<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phers,
which so playnly impugneth theyr
vices, that they be vnable by good reason
to refell it, tha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

and a cloke must be sought oute of Scryp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
eyther to do deface all Phylosophye, or
els to blynde mennes eyes withall: But
yf they vnderstoode the Scriptures, or yf
arrogancie woulde let them learne to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande
them as they be trulye meaned,
than shoulde they, confessyng theyr lewde
and wylful blyndnes, be ashamed of their
many vices, &amp; cease to disprayse that, that
is greatly to be commended.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:692:5"/>
For although (Good Reader) that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophye
is not to be compared with the
moste holy scriptures, yet is it not vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
to be despised: whiche (yf men wyl cre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dyt
the holy doctours) maye be proued by
the iudgement of S. Augustine, which in
his booke <hi>De doctrina Christiana. cap. xl</hi>
exhorteth vs to the reading therof, saying
Yf they whiche be called Phylosophers,
specially of Plato his secte, haue spoken
ought that is true, and appertinent to our
faythe, we ought not onely not to feare it,
but also to chalenge it as <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> owne, from
them whiche are no ryght owners therof.
For lyke as the Egyptians had not onely
Idoles and great burdens which the Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
did hate and flye, but also vessels
ornamentes, and goodly Iewels of golde
and syluer, whiche the Israelytes depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng
from Egypt, vnder the colour of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowyng,
stole priuilye from them, not of
theyr owne mynde, but by the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement
of God, to turne that to a better
vse whiche the Egyptians abused: So in
the doctrine of the Bentyles are not only
contayned supersticious and fayned rites,
with great burdens of vayne labour, all
whiche we Christians followyng Christe
out from among the vnbeleuyng gentiles,
shulde vtterly detest and auoyde: but also
much good learnyng, mete for to serue the
<pb facs="tcp:692:6"/>
truthe, wyth some moste profytable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptes
of good maners, wherein are folide
some truthe, howe to worshyp the eternal
and onely God. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>These be the woordes, iudgement, and
councell of that moste holye Doctour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernyng
Philosophie, the whiche yf ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
had wel remembred. whiche vnder the
tytle of philosophicall science, haue with
Sophistrie, corrupted the true sense of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
scripture, neyther shoulde ther haue ben
suche contencion as nowe raygneth euery
where, neyther faultles philosophye haue
bene so muche despysed. Yet thynke not
(Louyng Reader) that I allowe philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie
to be Scriptures Interpretour, but
rather woulde haue it as an handmayden
to perswade suche thynges as Scripture
doeth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde. In whiche kynde whan
it is vsed, than maye al the prayses be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryfyed
therupou, with whiche the auncy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
phylosophers haue magnifyed it.</p>
            <p>Emonge whome Demosthenes the moste
famouse Oratoure among the Greciens,
calleth it, namely the moral parte, An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencion
and gyfte of God. After whome
Licero the mooste excellent aud eloquent
Oratour emong the Romaynes, calleth it
the gyde of lyfe, and the expulser of vice.</p>
            <p>These and many moe lyke co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mendaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
haue ben therto attributed, whiche a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunce
<pb facs="tcp:692:6"/>
it excedyngly, neyther disagreyng
with the holy Scriptures. Wherfore eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
christen man ought diligently to applye
it, namely the morall parte: whiche God
wrote fyrste in the hartes of men, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde
wyllyng to haue euerye man to
knowe it, he wrote it in the tables of stone
whiche he gaue to Moyses, promisinge by
hym a rewarde for suche thynges, whiche
before were obserued for vertues sake.</p>
            <p>So that Moral philosophye maye wel be
called that parte of goddes lawe, whiche
geueth commaundement of outwarde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauyour:
Whiche differeth from the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,
in as muche as the gospell promyseth
remission of sinnes, reconciling to god, and
the gyfte of the holy goste, and of eternal
lyfe, for Christes sake, whiche promyse is
reueled to vs from aboue, not able to be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prehended
by reason, according to the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of S. Iohn. The sunne whiche is in
his fathers bosome hath shewed it to vs.
And as for philosophie is nothyng els but
the obseruyng &amp; eschuyng of such thinges
as reason iudgeth to be good &amp; bad in the
mutuall conuersacion of lyfe, to whyche
god hath promysed a rewarde, and threte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
a punishment: so that the gospel is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
only by faythe, and philosophy
is iudged by reason.</p>
            <p>Reason only was the cause why al the
<pb facs="tcp:692:7"/>
phylosofers haue so extolled philosophie
whiche consydered that nothiuge was so
requisite and behouefull for mannes lyfe,
as to lyue togyther well and louyngly.
For lyke as lyfe can not be mayntayned
without meate and drynke and other lyke
good gyftes of Nature: no more coulde it
continue long withoute lawes &amp; maners:
the lacke wherof, saynt Iohn in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle
argueth to be the lacke of godlynesse,
saying: Yf we loue not oure neyghboure
whome we see, howe can we saye we loue
God whome we see not? Which texte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
well pondered, maketh as muche for
the commendacion of Moral philosophie
as any of saynt Paules do to the dispraise
therof. Wherefore I humblye beseche the
(most gentle Reader) to take in good part
this simple philosopycal treatyse, &amp; so to
vse it as sainct Augustine hath taught vs,
takyng the good, and leauyng the bad, ney<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
reuerencyng it as the gospel, neyther
yet despysing it as a thing of no value.</p>
            <p>And sithens the hollye Scriptures are
nowe come to lyght, &amp; Christians haue
professed to followe and fulfyl the same,
hauyng also innumerable blessynges and
rewardes promysed of God, for oure so
doyng: let vs be ashamed that a droppe or
sparkle of reason shoulde doe more in the

wyll moue
thys question more
curious than necessarye: where &amp;
howe Philosophye began, &amp; who
the enuenters therof, and in what
nation. Of whiche sith there is so
great diuersitie among wryters,
some attrybutyng it to one, &amp; some
to another, as the Tracians to
Orpheus, the Grecians to Linus
the Lybians to Atlas, the Pheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciens
to Ochus, the Perciens to
theyr Magos, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Assiriens to their
Chaldees, the Indians to theyr
Gymnosophistes, of whiche Bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das

to Pythagoras, the Frenche men
to theyr Druides, bryngyng eche
one of them brobable reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
<pb facs="tcp:692:9"/>
to confirme herein theyr opinions:
It shalbe harde for a man of our
tyme (in whiche many wrytinges
are lost, or at lest hyd) fully herein
to satisfye their question. Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles
for so muche as God hym
selfe (as witnesseth our most holy
scriptures) is the author &amp; begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
of wysedome, ye wisdome
it selfe, whiche is called of the
Philosophers Sophia, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I suppose that god, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
loued moste the Hebrues,
taught it them first, yf ye aske to
whome, I thinke (as also testifieth
Iosephus) to his seruaunt Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
who being i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Assiria, taught it
both to the Caldees and to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giptians.
The sonnes of Seth
were also studious in astronomye
whiche is a parte of Philosophy,
as appered by the Pyllers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
after Noes fludde (whiche they
<pb facs="tcp:692:9"/>
by theyr graunde father Abraham
had knowledge of) their science was
founde by them engraued: and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the flud was by Noe, and his
chyldren taught to other nations,
of whiche I graunt that he whiche
euery countrye calleth the fyrst fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
hath ben in the same countrye
better than the rest: as among the
Egyptians Mercurius trismegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus
or Hermes, whose workes
bothe diuyne and Philosophicall,
excede farre all other that thereof
haue entreted. Neuertheles y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians
(whiche haue ben alwayes

selues the inuention therof, and
haue therin taken great paynes,
naming it first Sophia, and suche
as therein were skilled Sophistes
or wysardes, whiche so continued
vntyll Pythagoras tyme, whiche
being muche wyser than many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:692:10"/>
before hym, consideryng that
there was no wisdome but of god,
and that God hym selfe was alone
wyse, he called hym selfe a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher,
a louer of wysedome, and
his science Philosophye. There
were besides these Sophistes, an
other kynde called Sapientes or
Sages, as was Thales, Solon,
Periander, Cleobolus, Chilon, Bi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>as &amp; Pittachus, &amp; thus there were
in all thre sectes, that is to saye,
wysardes whiche were called So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phistes,
and sages whiche were
called sapientes, &amp; louers of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
which were called Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
all whose science, was Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophye,
as we may call it natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
wysdome. Of whiche the kinde

It is the parte of Ethicke, to

therof, &amp; taught suche as gaue dili<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gence
to marke &amp; considre thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges,
to teache and instruct other therin:
and because Socrates in a maner
despisyng the other two kyndes

thyrd, &amp; taught it more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any of
the rest, therfore (because men must

I assente with Laertius,
<pb facs="tcp:692:12"/>
to call hym the first beginner ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
For although euen among the
Atheniences, the Sages, as Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
and Solon, both spake and
wrot of lyke matter before him, yet
because he so ernestly embraced it,
and equally placed it with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
twayne, he deserueth well the
glory of the firste beginner therof:
and although he wrote it not in
bokes (for whiche as him thought
he had a lawefull excuse, or rather
a good cause) yet his disciple Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hath writen suche thinges of his
teaching, as fewe so fully wrote of
before: whiche was as it is euy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
many yeres before Iesus the
sonne of Sirache, whose worke we
for the puritie of the doctrine ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
conteyned, reuerence and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour:
which as he hym selfe calleth
it, is a boke of morall wisedome,
thought full of diuinitie, as are
<pb facs="tcp:692:12"/>
also many of Platoes workes, as
witnesseth Saint Augustine. And
therfore because Socrates was
before Iesus Sirache, I referre
the inuention, I shulde saye the
beginning therof, vnto hym.
As for Salomons workes
are more diuine than mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
&amp; therfore I rather
worship in hym the
diuinitie, than
ascribe the
beginnyng of moral Philosophie,
wishing al men and exhortyng
them both to learne and to
folowe, those so diuine and
holy workes, vttered
by hym in his boke

some whiche wryte of hym, holde
opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that he was Enoch, whiche
as they saye, signifieth the same in
Hebrue, that Hermes dothe in the
Egiptian tong. And so make hym
in the seuenth degre from Adam:
reconyng after this sorte. Adam
begat Sethe, the father of Enos,
the father of Caynan, the father of
Malalael, the father of Matusale
the father of Iareth, whiche is the
father of Enoche. Which opinion
(although it be not to be vtterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected)

<pb facs="tcp:692:17"/>
whome they take for Hermes, was

much of Mercurius Pyllers. And
Mercurius was of suche same a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Egiptians, that they put

Howe be it Lactantiꝰ douteth not

conteyneth in it the hole su<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>me of
naturall Philosophye, oute of
whiche I thinke no lesse, but that
the Philosophers haue learned
oute theyr Science. Tully &amp; Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanciꝰ
(not shewing in what time)
saye that there were fyue Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
&amp; that this is the fift, whome
the Egipcians call Theuth, and
the greciens Trismegistus, &amp; that

the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in learning, &amp; deuysed markes
&amp; shapes of letters after the forme
of beastes, &amp; trees. He was called
Trismegistus, because he was
the chefest Philosopher, the chefest
prest, &amp; the chefest kynge. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesied
of the regeneration, and
beleued the resurrectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body,
and the immortalitie of the soule,
and gaue his subiectes warnynge
to eschue sinne, thretnyng them
with the iugement of god, wherin
they shuld geue acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptes of theyr
wycked deades. He taught them
also to worship god with diuers
kindes of ceremonies, and taught
them in all matters to make theyr
prayers vnto god, and instructed
the Ylandes in the knowledge of
god. And whan he had lyued into
a perfecte olde age, he gaue place
to nature. Hys preceptes, prouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes,

not able with hys marchandise to

was both riche in abstinence from

whiche is the very riches: of which
in his youth he was so desirous,
that he went fyrst to Egypt, and
after to Babylon, to learne Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomye,
and the beginnyng of the

had learned, he returned i<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>to Crete,

when he was perfecte, he went vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

excedingly geuen to luxurie, and
all kynde of vice, among whome

sayth y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Philosophy was so named
by hym, whiche before was called

hym what sciencer he was, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
a Philosopher, whiche is a
desirer of wisedome: thinking it a
great arrogancie, to haue called
him selfe wise. Tullius sayeth that
Pythagoras spake so wysely, and
so ornatly before Leontius a king,
that he, wondryng at his wyt, and
Eloquence, desyred hym to shewe
what science he knewe best, to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

to by or sell somwhat, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
myndyng neyther to gainne

regardyng neyther, apply theyr
mindes to serche and to knowe the
nature of thinges, which sorte last
named, we call Philosophers, that
is to saye louers of wysedome:
Thus by thys goodly parable he

Lyke as he which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to se the

and more to be praysed, than the

lyfe geueth his mynde to wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
and knowledge, ought more
to be accepted than any of the rest.
Saynt Augustine sayeth that he
was wel skylled in Nicromancye,
whiche may be very wel, for in that
time it was muche set by, and none
thought wyse, that therin was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant.
Ualerius sayeth that hys
hearers worshipped him so muche,
y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they thought it a great sinne to
forget ought which they hearde of

               <p>His wordes were so estemed that

in any matter, to saye y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras
sayde so.</p>
               <p>He was so good a Philosopher,
as scarce any deserueth to be hys
matche. He kept iustice so muche,
<pb facs="tcp:692:22"/>
that after hys death, the autoritie
of his name ruled the people of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talic,
whiche in tyme past was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
Magna Grecia. He was so
sparyng and profitable, that some
thinke he neuer did eate any dayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

men, whose aptnes he knewe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
by theyr countenaunce, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture
and maners. And he with all
his disciples, lyued in common to
gether, as well in loue, as in other
maners. For he taught them, that
true frendship was, to make one
harte and mynde of a greate many
hartes &amp; bodyes. In so muche that
Damon and Pithias whiche were
of his sect, loued so to gether (as
sayeth Ualerius Maximus) that
whan Dionisius the Tyrant wold
haue kylled the one of them, which
desiring licence to go and dispose
his goodes before his death, was
<pb facs="tcp:692:22"/>
graunted his request, yf he coulde

not agayne at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme appoynted,
shulde dye for hym: his felowe not
regardyng hys lyfe, so muche as
hys true frendeshyp: became his
pledge. And the other beynge let
go, came agayne at his tyme ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynted,
to redeme his felowe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
his death: whiche faythfulnes in

not onely forgaue them bothe, but
also desyred that he myght be the
thyrde of that felowship, that had
rather dye than to fayle in frend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shyp.
A notable example of most
constant frendshyp, and of good
instruction therin. To one that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
him what he thought of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
wepyng, he sayde. There are
in a womans eyes, two kyndes of
teares: The one of grefe, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:692:23"/>
of deceyte. To a couetous ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
he sayde: O role thy ryches are lost
vpon the, and are very pouertye,
for why thou art neyther the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
better fed, nor richer for them.
It was axed hym yf he desyred to
be ryche, to whiche he answered
naye, saying: I despyse to haue
those ryches, whiche with lyberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
are wasted and lost, and with
sparyng, do rust and rot. To one y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
was gaylye apparelled, and spake
vncomly thinges, he sayde: Eyther
make thy speche like vnto thy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
orels thy garmentes lyke
vnto thy language. It chaunced a
fole in Pythagoras presence, to say
that he had rather be conuersant
among women, than among Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers,
to whiche he sayde: yea,
swyne had rather lye rowtyng in
durt &amp; in draffe, than in clere and
fayre water. Beinge asked what
<pb facs="tcp:692:23"/>
newe thinge was in the worlde, he
answered: nothinge.</p>
               <p>Beyng asked what was Phylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophye,
he sayd: The meditation or

daylye to get the soule libertye in

               <p>He was the first among the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
that helde opinion that the

               <p>He kept scole in Italie, and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

hym so muche, that they

And whan his frendes reproued

At last he went from them, and

he dayly saying and doyng suche

whiche dyuers beyng displeased,
and because that he proued somme
whiche thought them selues very

not content, conspired against him,
<pb facs="tcp:692:48"/>
and accused hym, saying. Socrates

that there are no goddes:
and bryngyng in other newe spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites:
(For Socrates helde opinion
that ther was but one god, whiche
was without begynning &amp; ending,
whiche had made and gouerned,
all thynges, and that the soule of
man was immortall, and that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man had .ii. spirites assigned him
by god, whiche he called demones,
of whiche he sayde that one shewed
hym thynges to come, wherefore he
despysed theyr goddes and wolde
not worship them) &amp; agaynst tyght
and lawe he corrupteth our youthe:
wherefore let hym dye. Whan thys
was put vp agaynst hym. Lysias a
Philosopher wrote an Apologie for
hym, whiche whan he red, he sayde:
Lysias the oration is good and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent,
<pb facs="tcp:692:49"/>
but surely it is nothing mete
for me (for why it was more iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
than shulde seme mete for a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher)
and whan Lisias demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of hym sith it was good, why it
was not mete for hym, he sayde:
Garmentes &amp; shoes maye be bothe
good and fayre, &amp; yet vnfit for me.
but while he was iudged it is sayde
that Plato stode vp in his defence, &amp;
could not be suffered. And so he was
condemned by .lxxx. iudges, and cast
into prison: For whom the prince of
Athens was very sory, but the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
whiche the iudges had geuen
vpon him, whiche was y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he shulde
drynke poyson, coulde not be reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.
The kyng had a ship frayght
with sacrafices whiche he offered to
his ydols, whiche than was abrode
and he wolde neuer geue any sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
vpon any mannes death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it came to Athens. Wherefore
<pb facs="tcp:692:49"/>
one of Socrates frendes called In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clites,
counsayled him to geue a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
summe of moneye to the ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
to let him scape away secretly,
and so to go to Rome, but Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
sayde he had not so muche: Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
sayde Inclytes, I and thy frendes
haue so muche, whiche we wylle
gladly geue to saue thy lyfe, yf thou
wilt. To whyche Socrates answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red:
I thanke you and my frendes
but syth thys citie wherein I muste
suffre my death, is the natural place
of my byrthe, I had rather dye here
than els where: for yf I dye here in
my countrye without deseruyng,
onely because I reproue theyr wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednes,
and theyr worshipping of
vayne ydols, and wolde haue them
worship the true god, yf these men
of myne owne nation persecute me
for saying and maintaining truthe,
euen so wyll stranngers wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb facs="tcp:692:50"/>
I become: for I wil neuer spare
to say the truthe, and surely strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
wolde haue lesse mercye on me
than myne owne countreye folkes.
Beying thus mynded, he contynued
styll in prison, teaching his scholers
which resorted to him, many thi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ges
both of the composition of elemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
and also of the soule: but wolde
wryte nothing, for he sayde that
wysedome ought to be wrytten in
mennes hartes, and not in beastes
skynnes: neuertheles his disciple
Plato wrote welny all y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he taught.
A litle before he shulde be put to
death, he desired that he might bath
hym selfe, and saye hys orations,
whiche he dyd, and called his wyfe
and chyldren, and gaue them good
instruction: And whan he went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
the place where he shulde fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
his lyfe, his wyfe went after
hym, cryinge: Alas my husbande
<pb facs="tcp:692:50"/>
dyeth gyltles: to whome he sayde,
why woman woldest thou haue
me dye otherwyse? and sent her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye.
So when the cup of poyson
was delyuered hym to drynke, hys
frendes bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne to wepe, wherefore
he blamed them, sayinge: I sent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
the wemen because they shuld
not do as you do. Than Pollido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
profered hym a precious gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to dye in, to whom he sayde:
hath not myne owne cote serued me
to lyue in? why than maye it not as
well serue me to dye in? And than
after he had commended his soule
to god, he dranke the confection, &amp;
as he was in trauayle of death one
of disciples sayd, O Socrates
well of wisdome, yet teache vs sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
whyle thy speche lasteth: to
whome he answered: I can teache
you none otherwise now dying, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
I taught you in my life time. Thus
<pb facs="tcp:692:51"/>
finished he his most godly life, being

               <p>ARchelaus y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sonne of
Seuthꝰ (as sayeth
Appollodorꝰ) was
a good Philosopher
and verye studyous
in Platos workes. He was first an
hearer of Antilochus, a Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matycke,
and afterward of Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastus.
He was a verye wyttye
felowe, and of a prompt spirit, and
graue in communication, &amp; muche
excercised in wrytynge, &amp; gaue hys
mynde to poetrye. He delyted so
muche in Homer, that euery nyght
before he slept, he wolde rede som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what.
He learned geometry of Hip<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ponicus,
&amp; was thereto so dull, &amp;
yet so well learned in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> crafte, that
<pb facs="tcp:692:59"/>
he wolde saye that geometry fell
into his mouth as he gaped. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng
men singynge meaters that
he had made, ylfauouredly, he kic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
them on the sydes, sayinge: ye
breake myne, and I wyll breake
poures. Being called to a sicke ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
perceyuyng that he was sicke for
thought &amp; lacke of ryches, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed
vnder hys pyllowe a sacke
full of money, whiche he fyndyng,
was so ioyouse that he recouered
strayt wayes. Whan he was byd
to solute a ryddle at a banket, he
sayde that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chefest poynt of wyse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
was, to knowe to what pour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pose
the time was meatest. To him
that asked him why many scholers
of euerye secte became Epicures,
but none of the Epicures became
of other sectes, he sayde: because y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
cockes were made of men, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
men of cockes, or as some saye
<pb facs="tcp:692:59"/>
capons be made of cockes, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
cockes of capons. Beynge re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued
because he chalenged not a
yong man, whome he had ryght to,
he excused hym pretely, saying: It
is not possible, to drawe softe chese
with an hoke. Beynge asked what
ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was most in trowble, thought,
and care, he sayde. He that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syreth
most to be at quyet, and rest:
beyng asked whether it were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to marye a fayre woman or a
fowle, he answered: yf thou mary a
foule one, thou shalte haue gryefe
with her, but &amp; yf thou take a fayre
one, she shall make the cuckolde.
He called olde age the hauen of
all tribulations. He sayed it was
a great euell, not be able to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre
euyll. To an enuyoꝰ ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which
was verye sorowfull, he sayde: I
knowe not wel, whether euel haue
chaunced to the, or good to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb facs="tcp:692:60"/>
signifying therby, that enuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are as sorowful for others
prosperitie, as for theyr owne ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie.
As he sayled among the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
by chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they met with ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes
of true folke, which the the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues

chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to dye yf we be knowen: and
so may I (ꝙ he) yf we be not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen.
These &amp; suche lyke answers
he gaue, &amp; dyed at Athens when he

w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> to muche wyne. And was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted

He vsed also whan he slept, to hold
a ball of brasse in his hande, with a

asked what vauntage a man might

but the frutes verye swete. It
was tolde hym that one rayled on

<pb facs="tcp:692:61"/>
Beyng asked howe muche the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

to be of suche a noble citie. Beyng
asked what was frendship, he sayd:

Beyng asked what he had got by

He was disciple to Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus

Paule came to Rome and preched
there. And whan many of Nero y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

whan he might not talke with him

Emperour Nero, and got him the
loue and fauour of euery bodye:
Insomuch that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Senate won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered

Seneca to Paule, &amp; Paule to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca.

yf we consyder howe nedefull it is, as the
onely helpe that god hath geuen vs to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

onely ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is borne naked, destitute of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er

not one borne to his owne vse, neyther is
<pb facs="tcp:692:72"/>
any man able to lyue hym selfe alone. For
yf he had al the wul in the worlde, yet yf it
were not carded, spunne, dressed, &amp; brought
into clothe, it woulde not defend him from
the colde: Agayne yf he had al the grayne,
that spryngeth on the yearth, yet yf it wer

mennes offices one man alone can not doe.
And sith therfore it is so, that no man can
lyue alone, but must of necessitie bothe

better than good maners, that make eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
man glad &amp; wyllyng to do one for an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
that ioyneth vs togyther in loue and
frendshyp, and helpeth vs in all kynde of
necessities? Surelye nothyng. Wherfore
who so willeth to be riche, lette him learne
maners, whiche teache how to get, &amp; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne
frendes, which are the verye riches.
Whoso desireth honor, let hym study ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
maners, whiche is the only thyng in
man worthy to be honored. Fynally what
soeuer any man woulde attayne, let hym
learne mortall wisedome, without whiche
no thing that is good maye be obteyned.

In whiche kynde, sithe Erasmus, one
of the best learned in oure tyme, hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy
studyed, and therof compyled a boke
drawen (as he sayeth hym selfe) out from
the purest of the Philosophers, I haue
herein englysshed of his, suche as to me

them to other agreable to this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
omyttyng the rest, not because they

to set forth the rest, and not to loke for al
thynges here, in whiche nothyng lesse tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
perfection is pretended.</p>
            <p>As for the profyt and vse of Parables
I thynke it nedeles for to declare, seyng
theyr owne playnnesse declare theym so
playnly, as no man maye do it playnlyer:
as for example.</p>
            <p>Lyke as Humlocke is poyson to man,
so is wyne poyson to Humlocke.
What declaracion neadeth this nowe, to
be better vnderstanded, except a man phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicallye
shoulde shewe the properties of
wyne and Humlockes? Nowe as for the
vse of this in perswasion, it may be thus
applyed.</p>
            <p>Lyke as Humlocke is poyson to man,
and wyne poyson to Humlocke: So is
Flattery poyson to frendship, and licence
<pb facs="tcp:692:128"/>
in be flattered, poyson vnto flattery.</p>
            <p>Loe here the exaumple that Erasmus
vseth, wherin is contayned great councel
great wyt, and great learnyng. Fyrste it
teacheth that Humlocke is poyson, &amp; mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
whan it is myngled with wyne, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

Then cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sayleth he to beware of
flatterye, and in shewyng what maketh
flattery deadly poyson, he teacheth a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy
howe to auoyde flattery: For yf we
regard not a flatterer, nor geue hym lice<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
to flatter vs, we shall neuer be hurte vp
flatterye. Suche lyke commoditie shall a
man take by Parables, or as I call them,
Semblables, which hereafter shal folow:
the effect whereof, I haue not drawen into

not theyr maysters, and they y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> be bounde

vexeth a man whan he sleapeth.</p>
               <p>If they be miserable whiche haue cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
maysters although they maye go from
them: howe muche are they more misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that serue their vices as their masters
from whome they can not flye.</p>
               <p>They whiche woorshyp God for feare
least any euyl shoulde chaunce vnto them:
are lyke them whiche hate Tyrantes, and
yet reuerence them because they shoulde
not hurt them.</p>
               <p>Lyke as they iudge worse of a man the
whiche saye that he is wrathfull and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracious,
than yf they denyed hym to be

which saye there is no god at all, as the su<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>persticious
whiche saye God is frowarde
<pb facs="tcp:692:135"/>
and ful of wrathe and reuengeaunce:</p>
               <p>Luke as they whiche bryng vp horses

so they that teache chyldren, shoulde

               <p>As we beholde our selues in other fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes

               <p>Lyke as they whiche geue vnwylling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye,
seeme to haue but lyttle them selues:
euen so they whiche prayse other folkes
sclenderlye, seeme to desyre to be praysed
them selues.</p>
               <p>Lyke as in meates, the holsomnesse is
as muche to be requyred as the pleasaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse:
so in hearyng and reading authors,
we ought to desyre as wel the goodnes as
the eloquence.</p>
               <p>As a lookyng glasse representeth eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

               <p>Lyke as the shadowe foloweth a man

a flatterer what so euer a man doeth, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth

               <p>Lyke as a Phisicion cureth a man se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretlye,

               <p>

Lyke as the rule ought to be strayght and

and iust hym selfe.</p>
               <p>As a vessel can not be knowen whether

               <p>As a wyse maryner in calme weather

prepareth hym selfe lokyng for a tempest:
Euen so ought the mynde when it is most

               <p>Lyke as the famyshed for lacke of other

so the man can not be wyse, that euermore

               <p>Lyke as there is no tree but wyl waxe

not well attended: so is there no wyt so
good, but wyl waxe euyl, if it be not well

               <p>Lyke as there is no beast so wylde, but

               <p>Lyke as Phisicions with theyr bytter

               <p>Lyke as the Sunne is alone bothe to
