            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that when ſhe is ſolitary in the
Woods, ſhe is careleſſe of her
note; but compoſes her ſelfe
more quaintly and elegantly,
if ſhe conceives there be any Auditors, or if
ſhe be neere houſes: ſhe can chirpe it in a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1967:3"/>
corner and chant it in a Quire more delicate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Though I had thought to have accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
my ſelfe, in ſome reſpect to the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
(for I know there is a great difference
to which due reſpect may be had; <hi>Modus
orationis eſt auditor</hi>) Yet as the Martyr ſayd,
I ſhall coſen many this day, meaning the
wormes, whom (ſaith he) I ſhall deceive of
this fat carcaſe (which they would have
made a feaſt on) it being likely to bee
offered in Sacrifice to God with fire. If there
be any here that bring a worme of Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in their eare, expecting quaint and elegant
ſtraines, I ſhall deceive them, I make no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
for them; I muſt confeſſe as <hi>Nazianzen</hi>
ſayd of himſelfe, he never affected in his life
the glory or Pompe of the world, or riches
and great eſtate; but (ſaith he) learning and
eloquence I muſt confeſſe I have affected,
but I ſet no other price upon that, but onely
this, that I have ſomething of worth to
eſteeme as nothing for Chriſt, I have layd all
theſe low at the feete of Chriſt to advance
his Kingdome, though in a plaine and home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
manner. I liſt not to ſpeake in a vie; as the
two Artificers who contended for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
in their Art and facultie; the firſt draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Grapes ſo lively that hee cozened the
birds; the other a Vaile ſo exquiſitely that
he cozened the Artificer himſelfe. But if I
may have ſo much Eloquence and learning,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1967:3"/>
as to draw the attentions of the godly, I ſhall
not be ſollicitous nor ambitious, to attaine to
ſuch a pitch, as to exceede the expectation of
the learned. So much by way of Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie.</p>

            <p>Theſe words containe a Noble Elogie
which our Saviour doth moſt candidly give
to <hi>Iohn, He was a burning and a ſhining
light, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I purpoſe briefely to runne through the
words, there bee many things will offer
themſelves, but I will not inſiſt nor pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
any in particular, but take the generality,
and ſo draw to an Application.</p>
            <p>There be two maine things obſervable in
the words.</p>
            <p>Firſt,<note place="margin">1. Miniſtri.</note> the Office of the Miniſtery (for I will
take it rather in the generality, than fall into
any thing perſonally on <hi>Iohn</hi>) And ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the entertainement which they muſt look
for.</p>
            <p>The Office of the Miniſtry, repreſents
both their <hi>Qualities,</hi> how they muſt be qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified:<note place="margin">1. Qualitas.</note>
and their <hi>Dignity,</hi> how they are to be
dignified; all in the ſame words a little vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their conſideration. The <hi>Qualities and
Endowments</hi> which a miniſter ought to have,
are repreſented here in this Picture of <hi>Iohn;</hi>
wherein our Saviour deſcribes the Character
of a Miniſter. Like as it is in the heavenly
bodies, There be three things, <hi>Light,</hi> and
<hi>Heate,</hi> and <hi>Influence;</hi> We have proportionable
here, three Endowments of the Miniſters.</p>
            <p>1. They muſt have the <hi>Light of Knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. They muſt have the <hi>Heate of Zeale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:1967:5"/>
3. They muſt have the <hi>Influence of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue</hi>
both in life and Doctrine.</p>
            <p>They muſt be <hi>Lights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They muſt be <hi>burning Lights.</hi> Firſt,</p>
            <p>They muſt be endued with <hi>Knowledge,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Lux ſcientiae eruditio.</note> and
<hi>Vnderſtanding,</hi> furniſhed with <hi>Abilities</hi> for
the diſcharge of that Office; their Office
being to guide and to leade men in their way,
in their path.</p>
            <p>The light that furniſhes,<note place="margin">1. Modus. 1. Pulchritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, Savitas.</note> and endues them
for that knowledge, which for the manner of
it (for I doe but touch things) requires</p>
            <p>Firſt that there be a <hi>beauty and ſoundneſſe</hi>
of the light, that there be Orthodoxe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
not tainted, and leavened with corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in Doctrine.</p>
            <p>And there muſt be a <hi>plenitude</hi> and <hi>ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie</hi>
of knowledge,<note place="margin">2 Plenitudo, Sufficientia.</note> that it euqnires too, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to enlighten themſelves, and to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and enlighten others, and to guide and
direct others.</p>
            <p>And for the <hi>degrees</hi> of that ſufficiency,<note place="margin">2. Gradus. 1. Proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</note> it
muſt bee <hi>proportionable</hi> to the excellencie of

of the Moone, and another glory of the

and meaſures, ſo it is with Miniſters;
All ſtarres are not of the <hi>primae magnitudinis,</hi>
there be divers Magnitudes of ſtarres; and
there may be in the Miniſters divers degrees
of glory, and all in the compaſſe of that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie,

            <p>That all <hi>Miniſters</hi> ſhould be able to <hi>Teach</hi>

            <p>In the ſecond place,<note place="margin">2. Calor Zeli.</note> light of <hi>Knowledge,</hi>
and ſufficiency is not ſufficient to qualifie a
Miniſter enough, that light muſt be animated
with the heate of zeale.</p>
            <p>The Philoſophers diſpute (and if I miſtake
not, I rather thinke they be in an errour) and
conceive that thoſe Coeleſtiall bodies, the
Sunne and the Moone, are not <hi>Actu Calidi</hi>
onely they have a virtue, and by way of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nencie
as it were, they doe produce heate
below, and are not hot themſelves. I rather
thinke that to containe any thing by way of
<hi>Eminency,</hi> is a property of God, <hi>God containes
all things Eminenter:</hi> theſe faculties which
he hath not actually, habitually, and ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
in himſelfe as faculties, yet hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
them eminently, as being able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
all; but no creature can produce any
thing but by ſome vertue put into it, which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1967:6"/>
is enabled: but theſe lights, howſoever
theſe heavenly lights muſt be <hi>Actu Calidi,</hi>
they muſt have a heate in themſelves, <hi>viz.
Heate of Zeale:</hi> let it bee the ſtile of the
Falſe Church to be <hi>Filii Carbonis, ſonnes of
the Coale,</hi> as <hi>Iob</hi> calls the ſparkles, ſo hot, as
they be all for burning, all for Inquiſitions,
and blood and Martyrdome; let it bee the
Commendation of the true Church, and true
profeſſion, that they be <hi>Filij Lucis, Children
of Light,</hi> rather inlightners than conſumers,
by way of burning: though that ſpirit you
know ſuites not the ſtate of the Goſpell, that
calls for fire from heaven: though there be
difference betweene calling for fire from
heaven, and fetching fire from hell to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
States and Parlements. There is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
betweene being touched with a
Coale from the Altar, and being kindled
with a match from the vault to ſet on fire.
There muſt be a <hi>Heate,</hi> but a regular and true
<hi>Heate,;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1. Pro.</note> A heate of zeale carried with <hi>Pro</hi>

or <hi>Distinctive.</hi> So then they that are infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
(or inflamed rather) with this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
heate have a double property,<note place="margin">1. Gloria Dei.</note> 
               <hi>poſitive</hi>

not to aſcend this hill, this Pulpit without
ſuch a Meditation as <hi>Zerxes</hi> had, who when
he beheld his Army from an hill, wept that
ſo many ſhould dye within the Compaſſe of
ſo few yeares? So they muſt have a tender
thought that any poore ſoule ſhould periſh
thats under their view, under their Charge:
and as for theſe there muſt be a <hi>Zeale Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Contr.</note> ſo a <hi>Zeale</hi> againſt all <hi>Errour</hi> and <hi>Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

againſt all ſinne, and againſt all ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition,

               <note place="margin">3. Influentia virtutis.</note> and
<hi>Heate of Zeale</hi> to animate and quicken, ſo
theſe two muſt have an <hi>Influence of Vertue:</hi>
The world, the vulgar know no great matter
of uſe, that the ſtarres and theſe glorious
lights have, and therefore will hardly be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to beleeve that they are of that Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
that Philoſophers and Mathematickes
teach, divers of them to be as bigge or big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than the whole Earth, they thinke that
ſuch great bodies ſhould be made onely for
ſhew, for thats all the uſe they can ſee of
them, to beautifie and beſpangle the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1967:7"/>
to be an ornament to the world and to
give light, but it is not credible there ſhould
be ſo meane a uſe of ſuch great and glorious
bodies; for beſides that, they have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
on the earth, thoſe ſtarres of light,
the flowers that we ſee here below, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
by thoſe flowers of lights, the ſtarres
which are above in the Firmament, they are

of all theſe lower things here, by ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
an Influence on them. And ſo the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
lights (as wee are now ſpeaking of)
The <hi>Miniſters,</hi> their <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Knowledge,</hi>
and their <hi>Heate</hi> of <hi>Zeale,</hi> muſt have an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
upon the people that be committed
too them, both in Integrity of life, and Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of Doctrine and Inſtruction;<note place="margin">1. Aſsiduitate Doctrinae.</note> they muſt
be Trees of Knowledge, and Trees of Life
to in Gods garden, to build up to both, and
with both. Our Saviour that was the higheſt
in his owne Church, in his owne houſe, made
that the higheſt of his Offices, to imploy
himſelfe diligently in his Fathers worke.
We reade of nothing, nor heare of nothing,
but <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>doing good,</hi> nothing but of
his Influence continually. And <hi>Paul</hi> (as the
Father ſpeakes) like ſome winged <hi>Triptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>
that went about in his Chariot to teach
men the Art of ſowing Corne throughout
the world; hee went about ſpreading, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1967:8"/>
ſowing, and planting the Goſpell every
where he came, with infinite diligence, and
paines: there muſt be <hi>holineſſe and integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Life</hi> added to it. (I will not inlarge my
ſelfe in an Argument ſo common,<note place="margin">2. Integritate vitae.</note> and which
would afford ſo many and ſo full diſcourſes,
of wit and illuſtration as all know) Miniſters
muſt not be like the drugge that the Phyſitian
ſayes (or at leaſt the world takes it ſo ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily)
is hot in the mouth, and cold in the
operation; hot in the Pulpit, and zealous
there, and frequent there, but careleſſe and
unconſcionable in their lives: <hi>Origen</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
to <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and being deſired to
Preach; after he had denyed the truth, and
his ungodly offering Sacrifice to an Idoll;
(though he was conſtrayned, and conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
on hard tearmes) the booke happens to
open upon that place of the <hi>Pſalmist, What
hast thou to doe to take my word into thy mouth,
ſeeing thou hateſt to be reformed?</hi> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of his owne fault reflected up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
his Conſcience, and made him cloſe the
booke, and ſit downe and weepe: ſo theſe
that are not content to joyne <hi>holineſſe of life,</hi>
to their <hi>diligence of Preaching,</hi> the beſt way
for them is to repent of their Preaching; and
ſo to Preach Repentance to the people.</p>
            <p>But to come to the ſecond; beſides the

of Chriſt with no earthly Ornaments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
her indeede, but all heavenly a
Crowne of 12. ſtarres on her head, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the 12. Apoſtles; Cloathed with
the Sunne; the Sunne of Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,
the doctrine of Iuſtification by
faith, as ſome have interpreted it, and the

under her feete; it is her Crowne to have

               <hi>Herod</hi> promiſed <hi>Herodias</hi> (on

promiſed but halfe his Kingdome; but <hi>Iohn
Baptiſts</hi> head was more worth, a faithfull
Miniſter is worth a Kingdome: <hi>Satius Solem

they ſayd ſometimes at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> better
the Sunne ſhould be taken out of the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

Miniſter ſhould be taken out of the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
better to loſe the Lights of heaven, than
theſe lights that guide to heaven: there is
a great deale of Nobleneſſe and excellencie
in them, they be heavenly Lights. The ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is, if God ſhould take a ſhape to repreſent
himſelfe viſibly to men, the outward part of
it, as it were the Garment, ſhould be light
animated and quickened with truth for our

Knowledge, in the purity of Divine Truth,
theſe Meſſengers and Ambaſſadors, Types

great deale of glory in them,<note place="margin">2. Neceſcilas.</note>
            </p>
            <p>And there is a great neceſſitie of it, for
Miniſters, burning and ſhining Lights are as
Neceſſary as lights in a darke place, in a dark
roome, upon which the Soule and the ſafety,
the walke and the Iourney, and the good iſſue
of all Chriſtians doth depend; as he makes

            <p>We may note here the condition of the
world, the malignity of it,<note place="margin">2. Mundi.</note> the true rice of
this malignity. What's the reaſon that men
riſe up in Armes againſt the Miniſters of
Gods Word,<note place="margin">1. Malignitus unde.</note> as it is too frequent, they are
Lights, and theſe love the workes of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe:
the theefe cares not to come at the
light: they ſay when <hi>Hercules</hi> drew up
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1967:12"/>
               <hi>Cerberus</hi> from hell, he led him in a chaine,
and he went quietly till he came to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon,
and ſaw the peeping of the light;
but then he puld ſo ſtrongly that he had like
to have puld the Conquerour and all backe
againe. <hi>Cerberous</hi> his helliſh brood cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
heavenly light; they ſtumble at that light
it is offenſive: though the ſweeteſt and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulleſt
thing in the world, to the eyes that be
ſound and whole, yet to the eyes that be not
ſound, light is troubleſome; or if a man have a
minde to ſleepe on ſecurely in courſes of
darkneſſe and ſin, light is offenſive, and that's
the Reaſon of this malignitie. The world
hath thought (though experience hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed
it) that the Torrid Zone is uninhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table,
it is ſo hot that there is no inhabitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
there. Men thinke a burning light is too
hot, it is not habitable, not able to be dwelt
in and endured, the burning is ſo offenſive:
and therefore as they that dwell under the
line (they ſay) curſe the riſing of the Sunne,
they are glad when it ſets and riddes them
of their burning, and when it riſes fall a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
fretting, and chaſing; men are angry at
the light<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when it beginnes to ſcorch and
burne, to come neere and cloſe to ſinne, when
it meetes with their corruptions; the true
Reaſon why there is ſuch a repugnancie is
we ſee it in the light, and wee feele it in the
heate. And would you ſee their foule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1967:13"/>
what they doe that oppoſe the
Light, what a foule ſinne it is: It is as if they
ſhould goe about to deprive us of the light
of the Sunne,<note place="margin">2. Caecitas &amp; Deformitas quarta.</note> that we may live in perpetuall
darkeneſſe, and what would we thinke of
ſuch perſones: None but ſuch as are kinne
to darkeneſſe can count the light grievous,
be weary of light, and complaine of too
much light: not to endure burning and ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
lights, it is an Argument they bee very
neere a kinne to darkeneſſe that hate it ſo:
the light muſt needs be gracious and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
to the children of the light onely: they
were wont to Father it on the Chriſtians,
that in their meetings they meete by night;
as they were faine to doe in perſecution,
and ſo uſed Candles: at laſt towards the
cloſe of all, they put out the Candles and
fell to promiſcuous mixtures, and commix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:
No it concernes them that be Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of darkeneſſe to put out the light, then
<hi>Creſcite &amp; multiplicamini,</hi> then they breed and

Though every Candleſticke, every place

them when they come in Gods name, and
convey Gods light to convince us. When
Gods heate warmes us let us not reſiſt and
oppoſe but ſubmit: as a Father ſpeakes of
fire and light, the light is moſt ſweete and
gracious, but the burning moſt terrible; ſo
if we miſuſe the Goſpell, and miſuſe the
light, onely to play with the light and pleaſe
our ſelves with light, and will not be ſet on
fire, will not be enflamed, it will ſcorch in
the end, it will bring burning, Iudgements,
and calamities, to contemne and trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Gods Word and Miniſters.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place Magiſtrates and thoſe

               <note place="margin">1. Tueantur Intueantur.</note> then thoſe that are ſuch it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
Magiſtrates very well to advance, to
protect; to ſet a burning and ſhining light up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a Golden Candleſticke, and to make a
Caſtle, a Caſtle at leaſt of horne-worke, to
defend and protect them, that theſe lights
may be according to that in the ſtory; the
lampe that never went out: that they may
not eaſily be puffed or blowne out, by thoſe
that doe maligne and oppoſe them; and thoſe
that have power in this kinde of Iuriſdiction,
influence and over-ſight, ſhould remember
they may be ſnuffers to make the light burne
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1967:14"/>
more cleere; they muſt not be extinguiſhers
to extinguiſh and to quench the light, they
themſelves ſhould be lights, lampes; take
heede, take order that ſuch perſons be not
dampes to put out the light. The Flye whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
buſily or enviouſly, clings about the
light, but ſinges his owne wings with it, and
they that thinke to extinguiſh the light will
but burne their owne wings.</p>
            <p>And to adde one word to the particular
occaſion, that which <hi>Pariſienſis</hi> ſayd ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
concerning excommunicating of men
for trifles, it is (ſaith he) as if a man ſhould
ſee a flye or flea on a mans forehead, and for
that ſhould preſently take a bettle and knock
him in the head to kill the flye: It muſt not
be for toyes and trifles; and ſo likewiſe not
for every ſmall failing and exorbitancie or
defect in the light, preſently to extinguiſh
and put out the light, but rather to recover
and to helpe it.</p>
            <p>And for ſuch as are not ſuch,<note place="margin">2. Non tales amoveant.</note> not burning
and ſhining lights. The Canon law, as it is
reported out of that and it is very pertinent to
make this order and conſtitution (according
to the Popiſh faſhion) if the Hoaſt be conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
(ſay they) in a nights viſitation, the
Prieſt ſhall be bound to put out the Candle,
leſt the people ſhould worſhip an empty
Pix ſo if there be any that have conſumed
integritie, and holineſſe of life, if the hoſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1967:15"/>
be gone, it is fit that the Candle ſhould bee
put out, that men doe not worſhip an empty
Caske, which hath no worth anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place (I ſee I muſt of neceſſity
be forced to contract things, but I had rather
breake off abruptly, than incroach too much
on the time,<note place="margin">3. Ad Clerum.</note> and other occaſions) the laſt
concernes the Miniſters and the Clergie:
I ſhould have preſcribed ſomething both
concerning their duty;<note place="margin">1. Officia.</note> a little to have preſt
home the things that are contained in the
application of their duty:<note place="margin">1. Splendor vitae.</note> For holineſſe of
life for diligence of Doctrine: to be painefull
and industrious in Preaching, joyn'd with a
holy life,<note place="margin">2. Fulgor Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinae.</note> for otherwiſe, as it is ſaid of a ghoſt,
a leane meager ghoſt, with a Torch in the
hand, it makes it looke more gaſtly; ſo to
have a Miniſter that hath light in his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and yet an ugly and filthy life, there
is not a more gaſt and ugly ſight in the world:
and for another thing too:<note place="margin">3. Candor Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi.</note> to have commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
that Candidneſſe, and that ingenuity of
brethren towards their brethren, which wee
ſee our Saviour affords to <hi>Iohn,</hi> that not to
backebite, or detract, or draw downe the
price and excellencie of our fellow Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
ſuppoſe they doe as they may out-ſtrip
us, but candidly an ingenuouſly to give them
their due; <hi>He is a burning and a ſhining light,</hi>
and to agree unanimouſly, and lovingly, and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1967:15"/>
Chriſtianly; there is nothing of more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
nor more uſe than for Miniſters to
cohere, and ſo to ſtregthen and fortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
The ſcales of the Leviathan (as <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>
makes the compariſon) ſticke cloſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
wickedmen in their projects and their
deſignes, ſticke cloſe like the ſcales of the
Leviathan, repreſenting the Devill as moſt
interpreters expreſſe it. And the ſtones of
the Temple (they ſay) were ſo cloſe, ſo ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
together, as if there were but one
ſtone, there was no pieecing appear'd or was
ſeene by any, though they looked narrowly.
The ſtones of the Temple, they that would
helpe to build up Gods Temple, ſhould ſtand
cloſe together, and remove bones of conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and difference, and rivality, and emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.
It was a Noble ſpeech of but a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
man: a <hi>Lacedemonian,</hi> when he happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
not to be choſen (where the Citie ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
it ſhould be ſo) into the number of
the 30. to be one of the principall officers
of the Citie, when all the reſt of his friends
were diſcontent and angrie to ſee that hee
the moſt noble and worthy of all the reſt
(as they thought) was paſt over, he himſelfe
tooke it well; I am glad ſayes hee that the
Citie hath ſo many men of more worth than
my ſelfe. It ſhould be the honour and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
of every one to rejoyce that there bee
thoſe that doe excell them, not to deſire the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1967:16"/>
priority, or precedencie themſelves, but to
be content to put it where God hath given
it.</p>
            <p>And in the laſt place principally for zeale,
to have preſt that,<note place="margin">4. Ardor. Zeli.</note> all light, and all diligence,
and all holineſſe, and all unanimity, except
there be ſome edge of zeale put upon it, is
nothing worth: and I thought to adde ſome
directions:<note place="margin">2. Incentivum. 1. Tempus eri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>git. Peccantes Gigantes.</note> and in the laſt place ſome Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
that might ſtirre and kindle all to the
exerciſe of this heavenly grace; the time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
it, ſinne is Gyant-like, Popery growes
bold, witneſſe the late fire (I thought to have
added ſomething more concerning it.) If
they be bold to claime kinne of us, and to
beare the world in hand, that our owne Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
maintaine a ſecret correſpondence
with Popery, it is time for our zeale to
breake out to quit the Church, this Noble
and honourable Church, from ſuch a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
imputation: The Act it ſelfe of
zeale is very opportune and ſeaſonable:
<hi>Nunc ſi unquam,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. Actus. 1. Oportunus.</note> 
               <hi>niſi nunc quando?</hi> as the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is: if not now when ſhall we ſhew our
ſelves zealous; when Popery growes ſo bold
and ſo high, ſhall we expect greater matters,
and is it not time to make an oppoſition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them, and now if ever.</p>
            <p>They that write the ſtory of the Travailes
of the Apoſtles report that <hi>Simon Zelotes,</hi>
preached here in <hi>England;</hi> if ever there nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1967:16"/>
ſome <hi>Zelotes</hi> to come againe it is now,
ſuch as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſpeakes of <hi>Eliah,</hi> that hee
ſuckt fire out of his Mothers breſt, that have
beene moulded to a holy heate and fire:
nothing elſe can defend and preſerve the
chaſtitie and integritie of the Church. A
cold modeſty betrayes a woman invites,
and provokes an impudent ſoliciter, a
coy magnanimous countenance muſt vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
her aſſaulted Chaſtity. An angry coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
drives away fleerers, and fawners,
and flatterers, it hinders ſo much as the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
whereas coldneſſe gives way, and
hope and poſſibilite.</p>
            <p>Againe,<note place="margin">2. Fructu oſus.</note> as the time requires it, and the
act very ſeaſonable, I will adde this too;
Our timely and ſeaſonable zeale may bee
more effectuall than perhappes wee may
imagine. The leaſt beame of light is able to
breake through the thickeſt darkeneſſe, to
ſhine in the darkeſt place. The leaſt ſparke of
fire is enough (if well husbanded and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)
to kindle the whole world. And as at
the day of Conflagration, that purgatory
fire that ſhall purge and refine all the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
is conceived it ſhall be out of a contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution
and commixion of ſtarres. That of
all the burning and ſhining lights, there ſhall
be made that great heate that ſhall conſume
all the burning and ſhining lights of Sathans
Kingdome, if they would contribute and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1967:17"/>
make a ſhot together of their zeale, to make
an oppoſition of ſinne and ſuperſtition.</p>
            <p>And in the laſt place,<note place="margin">3. Munus.</note> our duty and office
doth require it, it is as proper for to have
zeale in the Miniſtry,<note place="margin">1. Neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um in nos in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbit.</note> as to have fire in the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar.
We are the keepers (as it were) of the fire,
to ſee that the fire goes not out; as thoſe of
<hi>Athens</hi> in the Games in which they runne
with,<note place="margin">1. Cura.</note> Lampes in their hands, One ranne as
farre as hee could and there delivered it to
another, to carry farther, and to a third, and
ſo the ſucceſſion was continued. We have
received the Lampe of Gods Word and
truth from our Predeceſſors, who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
it us: let us runne on cheerefully and
couragiouſly, to deliver it to our ſucceſſors,
and ſo to all poſterity. Though fire in the
houſe may be dangerous, there's no man but
deſires to have fire on the hearth that's uſeful:
though among inferiour and ignorant peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
heate with light may be dangerous, yet
among the Clergie, among the Judicious and
able Clergie, if their light were quickned
to heate, there would be no danger but excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
uſe of it.</p>
            <p>And the world expects ſo much of us,<note place="margin">2. Culpa:</note> and
will be ready to lay all the blame on us; that
which <hi>Luther</hi> ſayd ſometimes <hi>Nunquam pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riclitatur
Religio niſi inter Reverendiſsimos:</hi>
The vulgar are ready enough to take this up
as a Maxime, as an Oracle. It is obſerved
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1967:17"/>
when Chriſt was Crucified, <hi>Pilate</hi> the civill
Magiſtrate abſolved him, <hi>Caiphas</hi> the high
Prieſt condemned him, <hi>Iudas</hi> his Diſciple he
betrayed him to the People: the Laity are
willing to waſh their hands as <hi>Pilate</hi> did, and
thinke they have done all wel enough, if they
can lay the blame at the doore of the Clergy:
all the blame will lye on the unfaithfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
that ſhould be burning and ſhining lights
if ſin grow to a height, if ſuperſtition increaſe
all will lye there, it concernes therefore and
God expects it, as having laid the charge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us, I will ad this one thing by way of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion,
I have not yet ſpoken one ſtrong line,
(as they ſay) affectedly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but give me leave to
conclude with one ſtrong line drawne out of
the Proverbe of the <hi>Germans,</hi> the pavement
of hell (ſay they) is made of the bare ſculs of
the Prieſts, or ſhaved Prieſts, &amp; the glorious
Creſts of great gallants. The meaning is, the
greater and more eminent any one is in the
Church, and doth not employ his Eminency
for the maintenance of Gods truth, they ſhal
lye loweſt in hell, they will have the deepeſt
condemnation: and now the choyſe is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
theſe two, we muſt either burne in <hi>zeale</hi>
or hazard it to burne in hell: and therefore to
conclude all, I know not whether is more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable,
the reſolute meſſage that <hi>Mordecai</hi>
ſent to <hi>Heſter, (Let not the Queene thinke that
ſhe ſhall eſcape in the Kings houſe, more than the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1967:18"/>
reſt of the Iewes, for if thou hold thy peacnow,
deliverance ſhall come from another place but
thou and thy houſe ſhall periſh</hi>) or the Noble
reſolution of <hi>Heſter</hi> upon this meſſage, (<hi>If I
periſh, I periſh,</hi> I will goe to the King though
contrary to the Law, I will interceede and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe
the utmoſt grace that I have with the
King, caſting away all care, and committing
unto God in a holy, pious, and zealous way)
<hi>I know not whether is more admirable:</hi> but I will
winde up all; let us all learne to be <hi>burning and
ſhining lights,</hi> ſo to conſume and chaſe away
the darkneſſe of Ignorance, the dregs of ſin,
and all the ſtubble of Superſtition; and then
though the people ſhould be inconſtant and
profidious, though our fellow brethren
ſhould be malignant and cenſorious, though
our fathers ſhould not be ſo benigne norr o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious:
yet who is ſuch a Coward that dares
not venture all upon the expectation of a
Chriſtian and gracious abſolution from our
Saviour; though all faile, miſ-judge, mm-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,
and miſ-thinke, we ſhall be ſure to have
a free, a candid teſtimony from our Saviour
at the great Day: <hi>He was a burning and a
