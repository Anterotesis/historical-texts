            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hriſtian <hi>Reader,</hi> thou haſt here preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to thy view a ſmall <hi>Tract:</hi> the matter whereof is weighty, and of concernment to all that are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Subjects of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> It is a thing of ſad conſequence to conſider how we have beene kept under blindneſſe and darkneſſe, although not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally, yet in a great meaſure, in regard of ſuch <hi>truths</hi> as doe immediately ſtrike at <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and his falſe power. As namely this great <hi>Truth,</hi> CHRIST the <hi>King</hi> of his <hi>Church</hi>; and that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath given this Power to his <hi>Church,</hi> not to a <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a Nationall <hi>Presbytery,</hi> but to a company of Saints in a Congregationall way. Now theſe <hi>truths</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:94171:3"/>
ſtrike directly at <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> and therefore kept and quell'd downe as errours. And ſo by reaſon of this obſcurity (we being halfe blind) ſuch bright <hi>truths</hi> ſeeme ſtrange to us, and goe under many aſperſions and calumnies, as carnall, erroneous, abſurd, and the like. And truely we have beene ſo accuſtomed to the yoke, that we ſeeme to beat down freedome, with caſting up a thouſand ſurmiſes, dreaming of ſtrange Conſequents. Nay, there is a generation of of Men in theſe times (ſome or moſt of them ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to plead for <hi>Chriſt</hi>) are as inveterate againſt the one true Way of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as if it would be the bondage of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> ſucceeding the light op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of <hi>Solomon</hi>: whereas it will prove to bee a Haven to our tedious ſtormes, and a period to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſtractions.</p>
            <p>READER, give over thy wonted cenſuring of mens Labours; and learne to be more wiſe; lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all prejudiciall thoughts concerning this <hi>Tract,</hi> and weigh it in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring it with the Word; if it will hold out there; then embrace it, and make uſe of it for thy comfort. Indeed it may be beneficiall to thee divers wayes.</p>
            <p>Firſt, by this thou mayſt learne to prize <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> more; what was that among other things that made <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſo beloved and excellent in the
<pb facs="tcp:94171:3"/>
eyes of his Spouſe? His head was of Gold. Now what is this Head of Gold, but that excellent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that is upon his ſhoulder?</p>
            <p>Secondly, it will adminiſter comfort to thee, in regard of the former yokes, of which there are hopes, they will bee broken off, at leaſt in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing of theſe <hi>Truths;</hi> Nay the day is now dawning, wherein <hi>Sions</hi> Peace and Comforts ſhall bee fulfilled, <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> ſet up, the ſole and great King of his Church.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, it will teach you to make that uſe of it that the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> doth of the like <hi>Truths: What manner of Perſons ought we to be?</hi> The uſe of it is divers, beyond my reach or weake Iudgement to preſcribe; and indeed my commendation of it doth but darken it, I being ſo far below the matter and the Author. But thy experience may make up that of which I fall ſhort. So commending Thee (both in the uſe of this, and any thing elſe that beares the ſtamp and Image of truth upon it) to the teaching of that <hi>Spirit,</hi> that is the Author of all <hi>Truth</hi> in the hearts of Beleevers, to be taught by it; I leave thee in the peruſing of this ſmall <hi>Treatiſe;</hi> hoping thou wilt reape ſome good by it.

this Hebrew word is uſed, <hi>Hallelujah,</hi> as if the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> ſhould provoke the <hi>Iewes</hi> after <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is fallen now to praiſe the Lord, becauſe he reignes.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Hallelujah</hi> there are theſe 2. things conſiderable. Firſt, what it is for which this <hi>Hallelujah</hi> is ſung. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from whom. Firſt, what it is for? It is for this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord God omnipotent reigneth, the Lord <hi>God,</hi> that is, <hi>Chriſt; Chriſt</hi> now appeares to be Lord God: his Lordſhip and Dominion was much darkned before: now it appeares to all the world, that he is Lord God, Lord God omnipotent: the Name of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the mighty God, as 9. <hi>Iſay,</hi> 6. but hee is but little knowne by this Name in compariſon: after <hi>Antichriſt</hi> is fallen, he ſhall bee knowne by his owne Name, the mighty God, the Lord <hi>God</hi> omnipotent, the Lord <hi>God</hi> omnipotent reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; his Crowne and Dignity were as it were hidden before in compariſon: little of the power of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty of <hi>Chriſt</hi> did outwardly appeare before: but now it ſhall appeare, before the eies of all his enemies, that it is he that reignes, he hath the Kingdome of Kingdomes, and is the Lord of Lords. 2. From whence came this <hi>Hallelujah, I heard as it were the Voice of a great Multitude, and as the voice of many Waters:</hi> by <hi>Waters</hi> we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand People; the voice of many <hi>Waters,</hi> of many People.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it is the voice of the Waters, the voice of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> reigning in his Church, comes firſt from the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, the common People, the voice is heard from them firſt, before it is heard from any others: God uſes the common People and the Multitude to proclaime that the Lord God omnipotent reigneth: As when <hi>Chriſt</hi> came at firſt, the poore receive the Goſpell; not many Wiſe, not many Noble, not many Rich, but the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:94171:6"/>
Poore: ſo in the Reformation of Religion, after <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt</hi> began to be diſcovered, it was the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that firſt came to look after <hi>Chriſt.</hi> In the 5. <hi>Cant.</hi> 7. we find the Church inquiring for her beloved, which is to be underſtood of theſe times of Reformation: ſhee went to the Watchmen, the Watchmen ſmote her, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed her, and perſecuted her; at the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. verſe ſhe goes to the <hi>Daughters</hi> of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and enquires for her Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that is, among private Chriſtians and common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and this glorious Church that is to come, when the Lord God omnipotent reigneth, according as it is here ſaid, the voice will bee firſt among the Multitude. It is obſervable that wee have in the 7. <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. where you find a deſcription of the glorious Church that is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, wherein Chriſt is to reigne gloriouſly, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription there begins at the feet, and goes upward: When <hi>Chriſt</hi> is deſcribed 5. <hi>Cant.</hi> the deſcription of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is from the head, and ſo downeward: But when the Eſtate of the Church in her glory is deſcribed; ſhee begins at the feet and goes upward, to note the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and the raiſing of the Church is like to bee at firſt among the meaner ſort of People, among the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. The <hi>Hallelujah</hi> for <hi>Babylons</hi> downfall was among the Multitude, before it came to the foure and twenty Elders, as you may ſee in the beginning of the Chapter. The Buſineſſe Brethren concerning the SCOTS, it is a buſineſſe, in the iſſue whereof wee hope there will be great things: Where began it? at the very Feet, at the very ſoles of the feet. You that are of the meaner rank, common People, be not diſcouraged; for God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to make uſe of the common People in the great Worke of proclaiming the Kingdome of his Sonne; the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94171:7"/>
Lord <hi>God</hi> omnipotent reigneth: the Voice that will come of <hi>Chriſts</hi> reigning, is like to begin from thoſe that are the Multitude, that are ſo contemptible, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the eyes and account of <hi>Antichriſts</hi> ſpirits, and the <hi>Praelacie,</hi> the vulgar Multitude, the common Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; what more contemned in their mouths then they? and yet it is from them that this Voice doth come; The Lord God omnipotent reigneth. Wee read in the 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.15. that the Prieſts and Levites were aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in that glorious Reformation of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> they did not prepare themſelves as the People did: So it is many times, that in many places where God is doing a great work, and whenſoever God ſets up the Kingdome of his Sonne, in that glorious manner that hee doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, he wil not begin with the Prieſts and Levites, they will not bee ſo forward, but the People at the firſt are more forward. In the 3. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5. it is ſaid concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the building of the Temple and <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> that the Nobles did not put to their necks, but it is ſaid the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple bleſſed thoſe that came to dwell at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; but yet marke further, it came from the Multitude as a noiſe of many Waters: though the voice of <hi>Chriſts</hi> reigne came firſt from the Multitude; yet it comes but in a confuſed manner, as the noiſe of many Waters: though the Multitude may begin a thing, and their intention may be good in it; yet it is not for them to bring it to perfection, that which they do commonly is mixed with much confuſion, and a great deale of diſorder. It was but as the voice of many Waters, the People had a hint of ſomthing; downe with <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> downe with <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,</hi> not underſtanding diſtinctly what they did; their voice was but as the voice of many Waters: Therfore
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94171:7"/>
it followes, and as the Voice of mighty Thundrings, that is, as one paraphraſes of it, the Voice that is more terrible and piercing like the Thunder; After the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this confuſed noiſe among the Multitude, God moves the hearts of Great ones, of Noble, of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ones, and they come in to the Worke, and their voice is as the voice of mighty Thundring, a Voice that ſtrikes terror, and hath a Majeſtie in it to prevaile. We heare of the voice of the Multitude in our owne Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, as the voice of many Waters, they cry up the Kingdome of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and cry downe the Kingdome of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> cry downe <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the <hi>Praelacie</hi>; but this doth ſeeme to be the Voice of many Waters, that the Adverſaries derided it, ſcorned it. It is but the Multitude, a company of rude People: But bleſſed bee God, we begin to heare the voice from the Thundrings too in a more terrible way: God begins to work upon the Great ones of the Land, the Worthies of the Land that are drawne together in that ASSEMBLY, and they doe begin to come to the Land, and beyond the Land to our eares, as it is terrible in the eares of the Adverſaries, that they begin to feare. This is the work of the day, for us to lift up our voice to Heaven, that it might bee mighty to bring forth more and more; the voice of our PARLIAMENT as a voice of Thunder, a terrible voice to the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> party, that they may ſay, <hi>The Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.</hi> And let us not be diſcouraged, for our Prayers though they be poore and meane, and ſcattered, they may further the Voice of Thundrings: though our Prayers bee as the Voice of many Waters, confuſed; we may by them further this Worke, ſo as to heare more of the Voice of our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies

                  <hi>1.</hi> Doct.</note> Firſt, that though the Kingdome of <hi>Chriſt</hi> may be darkned for a while; yet certainly <hi>Chriſt</hi> will reigne in his Church gloriouſly, at which the Saints will ſing <hi>Hallelujah.</hi>
            </p>

               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Doct.</note>Secondly, that the beginning of this glorious Reigne of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the Multitude of the People ſhall bee the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of it, and take ſpeciall notice of it. It is but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the firſt that I doe intend to ſpeake of, in way of a Doctrinall Concluſion, it is this</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Doct.</note>Though <hi>Chriſts</hi> Kingdome bee for a while darkned, <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall reigne gloriouſly, that is implyed: It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to <hi>John</hi> as a great wonder, as a glorious thing. Why, did not <hi>Chriſt</hi> reigne before? Yes, but not in that manner that now hee is to reigne: the Kingdome of <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath beene exceedingly darkned in the World; though it now begins to appeare a little more brightly, it hath beene exceedingly darkned. When he came in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94171:9"/>
his owne Perſon, how did he appeare to reigne, and be the Lord <hi>God</hi> Omnipotent? I meane outwardly, he was a man of Sorrowes; one that vvas rather a Worme then a Man: as it is ſaid of him, <hi>He was one, in whom appeared no Forme and Beauty; for which hee ſhould be deſired.</hi> Hee was even bruiſed by his Father, hee was in the forme of a Servant; yea in the forme of an evill Servant; being made ſinne for us, and beaten like an evill ſervant; yea made a Curſe for us, and that in the Abſtract; how did he reigne? they made him a King in way of deriſion, put a Reed into his Hand in ſtead of a Scepter, and bowed the Knee in ſcorne, and called him the King of the <hi>Iews:</hi> and thus he reigned outwardly, and not otherwiſe, in his own Perſon. And afterwards in the <hi>Primitive Times</hi> how did he appeare to be Lord <hi>God,</hi> and to reigne there, when the Heathen Emperors reigned over his Subjects, and had their wills upon them? his Subjects were but a company of poore diſtreſſed for lorne people, wandring up and downe, perſecuted, and deſtitute of all comforts. Afterwards when God brought <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Emperour and others to reigne, the <hi>Church</hi> enjoyed a little Peace, this was but for a little time. In the 8. of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> it is ſaid there was ſilence in Heaven for halfe an houre, which is applyed to the little Time of reſpite that the Church had in <hi>Conſtantines</hi> time: for <hi>Litinius</hi> who was joyned with <hi>Conſtantine</hi> in the Empire, preſently fell off, and grew a Perſecutor: then ſpread <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianiſme</hi> over all the World, that all the World ſeemed to be an <hi>Arrian,</hi> ſo that he was not acknowledged Lord God; and therefore not reigned. Then <hi>Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſme</hi> ſpread it ſelfe, and he ſet up himſelfe as <hi>Lord God,</hi> and hee preſcribed Lawes to the Conſciences of men,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94171:10"/>
and <hi>Chriſt</hi> was caſt out of his Throne: yea, to this day how little hath <hi>Chriſt</hi> reigned outwardly? The Divell himſelfe is a greater King, I meane in regard of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Subjects. Divide the World into thirty parts, and there are not above five of thoſe that acknowledge <hi>Chriſt</hi>; and out of thoſe five take them where <hi>Antichriſt</hi> reignes, and how little doth <hi>Chriſt</hi> reigne? and among them where <hi>Chriſt</hi> is acknowledged, and <hi>Antichriſt</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, how is his Kingdome perſecuted, and of the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſort? how is his Kingdome ſleighted, and many forward <hi>Profeſſors,</hi> and zealous <hi>Miniſters</hi> have hard thoughts of it. Yea, among thoſe that ſet up his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, in regard of their miſcarriages his Kingdome is darkned; ſo that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath but a little Reigne in the World: And it is a glorious thing ſpoken of to <hi>Iohn, That Chriſt Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.</hi> What ſhall we ſay to theſe things? That <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be King of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and ſhould appeare ſo little in his reigne as he hath done, and yet doth to this day. Let us ſtay a little here, and admire at the infinite depth and Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Gods Counſells that are paſt finding out. What God ſhould aym at and meane (if wee may ſpeake with holy Reverence) to ſuffer theſe Things, that his owne Sonne ſo infinitely deere unto him, ſhould have his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſo darkned in the World as he hath. We may think of ſome Reaſons why God doth ſuffer this; but what his ayme and intentions are in the depth of his Counſels, is infinitely beyond us.</p>

               </note>And it vvas upon this ground that God ſuffered his

Kingdome to be darkned hitherto, that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> might prevaile, becauſe of much Glory that he is intended to bring out of the prevailing of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> in the World: therefore in his Providence he hath ſo permitted it, as that the Kingdome of his Sonne for many yeeres ſhould be darkned. And (my Brethren) if the Kingdome of <hi>Chriſt</hi> had bin kept in Congregations, in that way that we and ſome other <hi>Churches</hi> are in, it had bin impoſſible that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhould have got head.

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:94171:11"/>
doth appeare outwardly, the more let us labour to bring our hearts under his ſpirituall Reigne: The more others ſay, We will not have this man reigne over vs, the more let our Soules ſubiect themſelves to him, and ſay, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is our KING, and let him reigne for ever over us, yea let us labour to ſymphathize with <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his <hi>glory</hi> and of his <hi>Kingdome.</hi> IESVS CHRIST, though he the <hi>glory</hi> of his Father, the Brightneſſe of his Glory, the Character and graven Forme, or the Image of his Father, yet is he contented to have his <hi>glory</hi> darkned. Who are we that we muſt have Glory in this world and outward excellencies, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> is willing to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them; Let us be willing to goe like the Witneſſes, clothed in Sackcloth till <hi>Chriſt</hi> comes to reigne: There are white <hi>ſhining garments</hi> prepared, but that time is not yet, though it wil not be long. The <hi>Bridegroom</hi> yet ſeems to be abſent, and therefore it is fit for the Spouſe to goe low and mean in the mourning weeds as a Widdow: the trimming of the Bride in her outward glory, may come hereafter, when <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall come in <hi>glory</hi> into the World. And Laſtly the Kingdom of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is darkned for a while outwardly, and therefore it ſhould teach us to bleſſe <hi>God</hi> ſo much the more for that Opportunitie that we have of ſetting vp <hi>Chriſt</hi> as King amongſt us: For yet, the Voyce is not heard much, That the Lord God Omnipotent rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gneth abroad in the World, though lately ſome noiſe we have heard: But, bleſſed be God, in our Congregations amongſt us, we may heare, That the Lord GOD Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent reigneth.

while it is ſo much oppoſed, and ſo little knowne in the world, it is a great <hi>mercy.</hi> And let us take heed of abuſing that opportunity we have, for darkning the Kingly Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which we profeſſe to ſet up: Eſpecially in theſe Times, when there comes to be a Voyce, though confuſedly, from the Multitude, and ſome Kind of Voyce of Thunder from the Great ones.</p>
            <p>But though it be darke for a while, certainly he ſhall reigne, and the Voyce will be glorious and diſtinct one Day, Saying, HALLELVIAH the Lord God Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent reigneth. He ſhall reigne firſt <hi>Perſonally</hi>; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in his <hi>Saints.</hi>

There are divers Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that have ſomewhat of this in them, we cannot give the diſtinct Voyce of thoſe Scriptures, but many of Gods Saints, they do heare ſomthing, and when a thing growes neerer and neerer, God will reveale it more diſtinct; <hi>Zachary</hi> 12.10. <hi>They ſhall looke upon him whom they have pierced, and ſhall mourne for him, as one mourneth for his on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sonne.</hi> It is uſually underſtood either of a ſpirituall looking by the eye of Faith, or beholding <hi>Chriſt</hi> at the Day of Iudgment: But why ſhould we take it for a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall looking, and looking at the day of Iudgment? that place doth not hold out, that is not the thing intended: They ſhall mourne every one apart; this is not like the ſetting forth of the mourning at the <hi>Day</hi> of Iudgement: And take but this one Rule, that all Texts are to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood

literally, except they make againſt ſome other Scriptures, or except the very Coherence and Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Scripture ſhewes it otherwiſe, or it makes againſt the Analogy of Faith; now there is nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this, but it may bee ſo. A ſecond Scripture that ſeemes to hold out ſomewhat is that in the 26<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> 29. <hi>I will not henceforth drinke of the Fruit of the Vine, untill that Day, when I drinke it new with you in my Fathers Kingdome.</hi> It is true, this is likewiſe interpreted in a myſticall ſenſe; but there is no reaſon, why wee may not take it literally. Not in the Kingdome of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Heaven; but in that Kingdome that hee ſhall come in here to drinke the Fruit of the Vine, to have Communion with his Saints in this World, 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Antichriſt ſhall be deſtroyed by the brightneſſe of Chriſts com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, the brightneſſe of his Perſonall comming: And that place Revel.</hi> 20. where it is ſaid, <hi>The Saints ſhall reigne with him a Thouſand years,</hi> which cannot be meant reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with him in Heaven. It is made as a proper pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar benefit unto ſuch as had refuſed <hi>Antichriſts</hi> Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, eſpecially to the Chriſtian Church: It is likely divers of the Prophets and Patriarchs may come in; but eſpecially it belongs to the Chriſtian Church: Now the reigning with <hi>Chriſt</hi> a thouſand yeeres is not meant reigning with him in Heaven, for after theſe thouſand yeares, there ſhall be many enemies raiſed againſt the Church, GOG and MAGOG ſhall gather themſelves together; if it were meant of Heaven, that could not be; and therefore it muſt be meant of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt</hi> comming and reigning heere gloriouſly for a Thouſand yeares. And although this may ſeeme to be ſtrange; yet here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore it hath not beene accounted ſo, it hath beene a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:94171:12"/>
Truth received in the <hi>Primitive</hi> Times. <hi>Iuſtine Martyr,</hi> that lived preſently after IOHN, he ſpake of this as a thing that all Chriſtians acknowledged: and likewiſe <hi>Lactantius</hi> hath ſuch expreſſions in divers places of his Seventh Booke. That there are glorious Times com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, wherein ſhall be plenty and fruitfulneſſe in the Church, yet Firſt, Rome muſt de burnt, and Babylon firſt downe, and brings the <hi>Sybills,</hi> the Heathen Oracles for it, and after a little Time there ſhall be ſtirring up of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies againſt them: Thus farre they goe; if they did not beleeve that <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelfe ſhould come perſonally to reigne, yet he ſhall with his <hi>Saints</hi> reigne in a Glorious Manner, and the <hi>Church</hi> ſhal be ſo raiſed up in the world outwardly, as to be aboue all the men of the World in outward Glory.</p>
            <p>And there are many Scriptures full for that which we may be much more confident in, then wee can be of the other. There is a Time comming, when there ſhall be this <hi>Halleluiah</hi> in the Church, <hi>The Lord God omnipotent reigneth.</hi> As in the. 7. <hi>Dan.</hi> 17.18. <hi>The fower Beaſts are the foure Monarchies, and the laſt is the Roman Monarchy, and that Babylon ſhal goe down together, and immediatly upon that, the Saints of the moſt high ſhall take the Kingdome, and poſſeſſe the Kingdome for ever and ever</hi>: at the 21.22. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>er.</hi> 27. <hi>Verſe. And the Greatneſſe of the Kingdome under the whole Heaven ſhall be given to the People of the Saints of the moſt high:</hi> the Kingdome under Heaven is not the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the World to come. More apparant is that in the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>Dan.</hi> which is ordinarily interpreted of the day of Iudgment: but ſurely this Text doth not aime at the Day of Iudgment principally, but at a Time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Firſt, becauſe many that ſleepe ſhall awake, not all,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:94171:13"/>
but many. Secondly he ſaies that they that are wiſe, ſhall ſhine as the Brightneſſe of the Firmament: Whereas the Glory that ſhall be put upon the Saints in Heaven ſhall be as the Sunne: Though this Glory be great, it is infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to that which ſhall be. The Third Reaſon is, that <hi>Daniel</hi> muſt ſhut up theſe Words, and ſeale up this Book as a great Secret: That there ſhould be a Reſurrection at the laſt Day, a reward of happineſſe to the righteous, and of Miſery to the Wicked is no great Secret, but this that was revealed to <hi>Daniel</hi> was a great Secret. But Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel might ſay, if the Booke be ſhut up, how ſhall the Truth come to bee knowne? Many ſhall runne to and fro, and take paines in finding it out, and at laſt this Truth ſhall come to be found out, and Knowledge ſhall be increaſed. And certainely it is the <hi>Antichriſtian</hi> yoke that doth hide this Truth. Men dare not whiſper of any truth, but of ſuch as are held in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>: But when there comes to be <hi>liberty of Churches,</hi> and that men may freely ſearch into this truth, knowledge will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. The fourth Reaſon is, becauſe in the laſt verſe, there ſeemes to be a Promiſe euen to <hi>Daniel,</hi> that hee ſhould have his ſhare and part in this glory: Was it ſuch a matter, that <hi>Daniel</hi> in the reſurrection ſhould have his lot, and that he ſhould ſtand up at the Day of Iudgment? No! but that he ſhould haue his Lot in that Reſurrection was a great Priviledge. Againe, for <hi>Chriſts</hi> Reigning with the Saints, take two Places in the Pſalmes. <hi>Pſalme</hi> 49.14. <hi>The Vpright ſhall haue Dominion ouer them in the Morning, there is a Time they ſhall haue Dominion, though now they have a Night, a morning ſhall come that the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ſhall have Dominion. Pſalme,</hi> 149.5. and ſo on: <hi>Let his Saints be ioyfull in Glory,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and a two Edged Sword
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:94171:13"/>
in their hands</hi>: To execute Vengeance upon the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, and puniſhments upon the People, &amp;c. What ſhall we make of theſe Scriptures? Indeed if we be put upon Allegoricall ſenſes, we may put off any Scripture; but if we take them literally, why ſhould we not? And the Promiſe that is made to them that overcome, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. the latter end of it; <hi>Hee that overcommeth and keepeth my words, to him will I give Power over the Nations, and he ſhall rule them with a Rod of Iron, and as the Veſſels of a Potter, they ſhall be broken to ſhivers.</hi> What ſhall we make of this? except the Saints ſhall reigne, and there ſhall be a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Reigne of <hi>Chriſt</hi> with the Saints, and ſo that place of the Saints reigning and judging the World, ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it of the Day of Judgement, but theſe Scriptures ſeeme to have an apparancie to be before; and therfore <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to make them <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Prieſts</hi> unto GOD ſpiritually, though not every one properly <hi>Kings</hi> over others; yet ſo, as to have Power and Dominion in the World; and therefore where it is ſaid in the Goſpell, that righteous men deſired to ſee thoſe things that you ſee, and did not: in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>Luke</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Kings deſired to ſee thoſe things that you ſee, and have not ſeene them</hi>: ſo that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall reigne together with his Saints. And that there ſhall be ſuch a reigne of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; and this <hi>Hallelujah</hi> appeares by many Arguments, as take this one drawne from Scripture.</p>
            <p>If there be many Propheſies and Promiſes in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that are not yet fulfilled; and the fulfilling where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will bring the <hi>Church</hi> into a more glorious condition then ever it was yet in the World: then there is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Time a comming. Now there are ſuch Scriptures wherein are ſuch glorious things promiſed to be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:94171:14"/>
to the Church, as yet never were fulfilled: And that wee know not what to make of, unleſſe there be a truth in this. 24. <hi>Iſay.</hi> 23. <hi>Then the Moone ſhall be confounded, and the Sunne ſhall be aſhamed, when the Lord of Hoaſts ſhall reigne in Mount Zion and in Ieruſalem:</hi> When was this, that there was ſuch a reigne of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in Mount Zion, as that the Moone was confounded, and the Sun aſhamed? Certainly this cannot be underſtood of their returne from their Captivity, for the People of the Iewes were under Contempt after their Deliverance from Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and came not to ſuch a Glory as this, and were under a kind of Captivity, and met with ſuch oppoſitions, that they were as long building the Temple as they were in Captivity, ſeventy yeeres.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Object.</note>But ſome that were in Captivity ſaw both the firſt &amp; the ſecond Temple; how could this be, if it were ſo long?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anſwere</note>The Foundation they might ſee, but not ſee it finiſhed. And in <hi>Ahaſuerus</hi> time they were in Captivity, as that had not God wrought mightily, they had all beene cut off by a wicked <hi>Haman:</hi> Therefore they were not ſo glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> 33.20. <hi>Look upon</hi> Zion <hi>the City of our Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities: Thine eies ſhall ſee Ieruſalem a quiet Habitation, a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle that ſhall not be taken downe</hi>: This Text neither hath not bin fulfilled hitherto, but muſt remaine. <hi>Iſay</hi> 54.11. <hi>Oh thou afflicted, toſſed with Tempeſts, and not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted; Behold, J will lay thy Stones with faire Colours, and thy Foundations with Saphires,</hi> &amp;c. When <hi>Antichriſt</hi> ſhall fall down, and the Iewes, called; and this Halleluia ſung, The Lord God omnipotent reigneth: then this Promiſe may be made good. <hi>Iſay.</hi> 60. if you read the whole Chapter, there are glorious things ſpoken of the reigne of the Church: but there have never beene ſuch glorious times ſince thoſe Prophecies, and therefore theſe we are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94171:14"/>
to be fulfilled. That place of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> of the <hi>dry Bones receiving Fleſh and Life</hi> is apparant to be the Iewes comming, and Gods ioyning two ſtickes together, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Iudah and Ephraim to be one; and therefore glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious things are to be expected immediately after the fail of <hi>Antichriſt:</hi> and if you may ſpeake of the fall of <hi>Antichriſt</hi> as done, you may ſpeake of thoſe Promiſes as done. So in the 21.22. <hi>Revel.</hi> There is a deſcription of the glorious eſtate of the Church, which ordinarily is applied to the glory of Heaven: But there is a miſtake in applying theſe things to the glory that is in Heaven, and not to thinke of the glory that ſhall appeare on Earth before. It is ſaid, that <hi>John</hi> ſaw the new <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> come downe from Heaven; if it had been the glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, more like Heaven ſhould have been opened, and he raiſed up to it. Againe, <hi>Iohn</hi> here ſayes, that <hi>the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the Walls had twelve Stones, and in them the names of the twelve Apoſtles:</hi> that the Foundations of Heaven ſhould have the names of the twelve <hi>Apoſtles</hi> is not like. For <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Patriarchs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſhall bee there as well as the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>; and why ſhould it not have the names of the Patriarchs and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets as well as the Apoſtles? And if you read the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations,</hi> you ſhall finde that the Kings and Princes came to give in their glory to the Church: Now that the Kings and Princes ſhould come in to make Heaven glorious, there is no likelihood in that. Thus there are theſe Propheſies to be fulfilled, and theſe Promiſes to bee accompliſhed, and therefore a time for the Lord GOD with the Saints to reigne gloriouſly: And why ſhould we think it much? Let us but conſider the great Deſignes that God hath in honouring of his Saints in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94171:15"/>
the World, and we have not cauſe to thinke much of ſuch a truth as this: for hereafter in Heaven <hi>Chriſt</hi> will be honoured before his Saints. But how will Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſt be honoured before all the World you will ſay at the day of Judgement? But onely at that time ſo long as the wicked ſhall ſtand for their ſentence? Doe we thinke there ſhall be no further time for Chriſt and his Saints to be honoured but juſt then? <hi>God</hi> intends to honour <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Saints</hi> before all the World. <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath purchaſed a glorious Condition by humbling himſelfe ſo low to the Death of the Croſſe, and therefore was promiſed the Heathen for his Inheritance, and the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt parts of the Earth for his poſſeſſion; and this muſt bee given in due Time; and <hi>God</hi> is pleaſed to raiſe the hearts of his People to expect it. And thoſe that are moſt humble, moſt godly, moſt gracious, moſt ſpirituall, ſearching into the Scriptures, have their hearts moſt raiſed in expectation of this. And it is not like that that work of the Spirit of theirs ſhall be in vaine. But <hi>God</hi> is beginning to cleere it up more and more: <hi>God</hi> is begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to ſtirre in the World, and to doe great things in the World, the Iſſue whereof (I hope) will come to that we ſpeake of.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Queſt.</note>But what ſhall bee the glorious Condition of the <hi>Church,</hi> when the Lord <hi>God</hi> Omnipotent reigneth; for which the Saints ſhall ſing this glorious <hi>Hallelujah</hi>? Tell us ſomthing of this good Land.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>In the generall I anſwer, It is the reſurrection from the Dead, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeakes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. concerning the Calling of the <hi>Iewes.</hi> But for Particulars; <hi>Glorious things are ſpoken of thee, O thou Citie of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt thing wherein the happineſſe of the Church
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:94171:15"/>
conſiſts, is this: That it ſhall be delivered from all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of it, and from all moleſting troubles, and ſo be in a moſt bleſſed ſafety and ſecurity. The <hi>God</hi> of Peace ſhall tread downe Satan ſhortly, and all that are of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is deſcribed in this <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. with his garment dyed in Blood, when he doth appeare to come and take the Kingdome; and he appeared with many Crownes on his head; that notes his many victories<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his name was <hi>King of Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords.</hi> And the Saints appeared triumphing with him, clothed with white linnen, and ſet upon white Horſes; is that a cloathing for Soldiers? Yes, for the Army of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comes to triumph then for to fight. <hi>Chriſt</hi> figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and vanquiſheth all theſe Enemies: and they come triumphing in white. All Teares ſhall be wiped away from the Church, <hi>Iſay.</hi> 25.8. <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.4. <hi>There ſhall bee no Brier nor Thorne, Ezek.</hi> 28.24. <hi>among the People of</hi> GOD; <hi>Ezekiel</hi> did once live among <hi>Briers</hi> and <hi>Thornes,</hi> but there ſhall bee no pricking <hi>Thorne</hi> left. And this Citie that is deſcribed in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> ſhall have the gates alwayes open, in regard of the ſecuirty that is there; no danger at all of any Enemy.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, there ſhall be a wonderfull Confluence of People to this Church, both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile</hi> ſhall joyne together to flow to the Beautifulnes of the Lord, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 35. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is compared to the Stone, that ſhall breake the Image, and ſhall become a Mountaine, and fill the whole Heaven, <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> 60. <hi>They ſhall come as Doves to the Windowes.</hi> And when IOHN came to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the Citie, the Church; it was a great and mighty <hi>Citie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, becauſe where there is much Confluence, there uſeth to bee a Contraction of much filthineſſe.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:94171:16"/>
Therfore in the third place it ſhall be moſt pure, a pure Church: yea, in great part, if not altogether. Nay we may almoſt affirme, altogether to be delivered from hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites. <hi>Without there ſhall be Doggs, and whoſoever ſhall worke or make a lye.</hi> Not without, in Hell; but without the Church. Hypocrites ſhall bee diſcovered and caſt out from the Church: though many get into the <hi>Church</hi> now; then the righteous Nation ſhall enter in. In the 44<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> 9. There is a deſcription of the Church under the <hi>Goſpel:</hi> And he ſhewes that none uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in heart ſhall enter in there: But the fulfilling of the Prophecies of thoſe Chapters in the latter end of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> will not be till this time; and then no uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed in heart ſhall enter, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.27. <hi>There ſhall in no wiſe enter into it any thing that defileth, &amp;c.</hi> there are two Negatives in the Originall, they ſhall not, they ſhall not enter. As <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſayes, <hi>Whoſoever comes to me, J will in no wiſe caſt out</hi>; I will not, I will not caſt out. <hi>Bleſſed are they that are called to the Supper of the Lamb. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, many were called, and few choſen; but now all that are called are choſen, and none that are made partakers of the firſt Reſurrection ſhall die the ſecond Death.</hi> It is a moſt pure Church, and therefore is deſcribed; The Walls to be precious Stones, the Citie to be as cleere as glaſſe, and the Pavement to be pure gold.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, there ſhall be abundance of glorious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies fulfilled, and glorious Promiſes accompliſhed. When you read the Prophets, you have Prophecies of many glorious things: And the knowledge of this truth will help to underſtand thoſe Prophecies. <hi>Revel.</hi> 2. <hi>It is ſaid there was a Booke ſealed ſhewed unto Iohn, and none could open the Booke but the Lambe.</hi> The Booke of the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94171:16"/>
Prophecies is a ſealed Book, and eſpecially the booke of the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelatious.</hi> But when the Lamb, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſhall come to reigne, this ſhall be opened to us. And therefore it is ſaid, the holy Apoſtles and Prophets ſhould reioyce at the deſtruction of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> becauſe the Prophets ſhould be ſo cleerely opened, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the People of <hi>God. Revel.</hi> 22.6. <hi>Theſe ſayings are faithfull and true: and the Lord God of the holy Prophets ſent his Angell, to ſhew unto his Servants, the things which muſt ſhortly be done.</hi> Why the <hi>Lord God</hi> of the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets? That <hi>Lord God</hi> that did intend to make the holy Prophets cleere and evident. Saies the woman of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria,</hi> when the Meſſiah comes, he ſhall teach us all things: We may well ſay it of the comming of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> heere the meaning of abundance of Prophecies and Promiſes, that we know not what to make of, ſhall be cleere before us. <hi>Chriſt</hi> is called the word of <hi>God,</hi> and is ſaid to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and true, becauſe he wil diſcover the truth and <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe</hi> of the Promiſes. And this will bee a glorious Time, when the Prophecies ſhall be opened, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes come to be fulfilled.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Abundance of hidden Myſteries of Godlines will be cleered then, that now are exceeding darke. 4. <hi>Revel.</hi> Iohn did but ſee a Doore opened in Heaven: But afterwards, <hi>Revel.</hi> 19. he ſaw Heaven opened. Noting the cleere revelation of Truth that ſhall be then: And, <hi>Revel.</hi> 11.19. <hi>There was ſeene the Arke of the Teſtament: Whereas the Arke ſtood before, in the Holy of Holies, that was ſhut up, that none was to come into it, but the High Prieſt:</hi> But now it is opened to all. In the Arke where the Secrets a Type of the Secrets that ſhall be opened at this Time, that were ſhut up before. Glorious Truths ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:94171:17"/>
and above all, the Myſtery of the Goſpell, and the righteouſneſſe of Faith ſhall bee diſcovered. Before what a little of the Myſtery of the Goſpel, and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Faith was diſcouered! but this will grow brighter and brighter till that time, which is the great Deſigne of <hi>God</hi> for his Glory to all Eternitie.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, the gift of the <hi>Saints</hi> ſhall be abundantly rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. He that is weake ſhall bee as <hi>David,</hi> and he that is ſtrong as the Angel of the Lord <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.8. and then ſhall be accompliſhed that Promiſe, that GOD <hi>will powre his Spirit on them; and their young men ſhall ſee viſions, and their old men ſhall dreame dreames.</hi> It was fulfilled in part upon the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> but the full is not till that time <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> ſhall be increaſed.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, the Graces of the Saints ſhall be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inlarged, even in a manner glorified; thoughuot ſo full as afterwards in the higheſt <hi>Heaven</hi> but mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſed. The Saints ſhall be all clothed in white lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen which is the righteouſneſſe of the <hi>Saints</hi>; that is, the Righteouſneſſe they have by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> whereby they ſhall bee righteous before <hi>God,</hi> and holy before <hi>Men</hi>: HOLINES ſhall be written upon their Pots, and upon their bridles: upon every thing their <hi>Graces</hi> ſhall ſhine forth exceedingly to the glory of <hi>God. Iohn</hi> ſaw a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the <hi>Bride</hi> comming downe from <hi>Heaven,</hi> with a Heavenly <hi>Glory,</hi> fit to meet <hi>Chriſt</hi> her <hi>Bridegroome,</hi> to ſtand in his preſence, and ſerve him day and night.</p>
            <p>Yea further, Religion ſhall bee honoured, and no more be a diſgrace. <hi>God</hi> hath promiſed to his Church that hee will wipe away their Reproches for ever.</p>
            <p>The People of <hi>God</hi> have been and are a deſpiſed Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: But their Reproach ſhall be for ever taken away,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94171:17"/>
and they ſhall not be aſhamed of Religion: for it ſhall be glorifyed before the Sonnes of men. Therfore it is ſaid <hi>Revel.</hi> 14. <hi>They ſhall have the Name of God upon their Foreheads, openly to profeſſe Religion; A time ſhall come when ten men ſhall take hold on the skirt of a Iew, and ſay, We will go with thee.</hi> Cant. 8.1. <hi>I will kiſse thee, yet ſhould I not bee deſpiſed:</hi> She would embrace <hi>Chirſt</hi> publikely, and ſhould not be deſpiſed: It ſhall be ſo honourable, as none ſhall be able to deſpiſe it. There are notable Texts of Scripture, to ſhew the great Honor that ſhall be in the wayes of <hi>Religion, Iſaiah</hi> 49.23. <hi>Kings ſhall be thy Nurſing Fathers, and Queenes thy Nurſing Mothers; they ſhall bow downe to thee, and lick up the Duſt of thy Feet.</hi> What a high expreſſion is this for the Honour of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe? So in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> 60. are a great many of notable expreſſions, <hi>verſe,</hi> 13. <hi>I will make the place of my Feet glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi>; that is, the Church. There was a time when as the Feet of <hi>Chriſt</hi> were as burning Braſſe, to ſhew the ſuffering condition of the Church: But now the Feet of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that is the Church, ſhall be made glorious, <hi>verſ.</hi> 14. you have two notable Scriptures for this in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie of <hi>Zachary.</hi> The firſt in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of <hi>Zachary,</hi> 16. <hi>They ſhall be as the Stone of a Crowne-lifted up:</hi> They are now trampled upon as the ſtones of the ſtreet; but they ſhall be as the Stones of a Crowne; and not onely ſo, but as the Stones of a Crowne lifted up: The ſecond place is in <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.5. <hi>The Governours of</hi> Iudah <hi>ſhall ſay in their hearts, the Inhabitants of</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>ſhall be my ſtrength in the Lord of Hoaſts their God.</hi> Wee know, that now in many places, the Governours of <hi>Iudah,</hi> the great ones of the Countrey, their Spirits have beene ſet againſt the Saints of God: Wee know what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prochfull
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:94171:18"/>
names they have put upon them, and how they have diſcountenanced them: Though the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of <hi>Iudah</hi> have counted them factious, and Schiſmaticks, and Puritanes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there is a Time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, when the Governours of <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the Excellency of Gods people, ſo convinced as to ſay in their hearts, that the Inhabitants of <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> that is, the Saints of <hi>God</hi> gathered together in a Church, are the beſt Common-wealths men: not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious men, not factious, not diſturbers of the State; but they are our ſtrength in the Lord of <hi>Hoſts,</hi> they are the ſtrength of a Kingdome, and ſhall be countenanced by them as the ſtrength of a Kingdome, as thoſe that will bee moſt uſefull in a Kingdome. This will bee a bleſſed time, when as wicked men and wickednes ſhall bee deſpiſed, and Godlineſſe as honourable as ever it was contemptible: this ſhall bee when the Lord <hi>God</hi> Omnipotent reigneth in his Church. And through <hi>Gods</hi> mercy, wee ſee light peeping out this way: That the Governours of <hi>Iudah</hi> are ſaying, <hi>The Inhabitants of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem ſhall be our ſtrength</hi>: Religion ſhall be honoured in the World one day, and not only at the day of <hi>Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> but here.</p>
            <p>In the ninth place; the preſence of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and of <hi>God</hi> ſhall be exceeding glorious in the <hi>Church:</hi> then the name of it ſhall be called IEHOVAH SHAMMAH, <hi>The Lord is there.</hi> They ſhall follow the Lamb where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he goeth: they ſhall ſee the King in his beauty and glory. And ſuch a preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> will be there, as it is queſtionable whether there ſhall be need of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, at leaſt in that way, that now there is. And therefore ſome interpret that place ſo: <hi>They ſhall be all
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:94171:18"/>
taught of God, and ſhall not need to teach one another.</hi> And ſo that place 2. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1.19. <hi>We have alſo a moreſure Word of promiſe, wherevnto ye doe well that ye take heed untill the Day dawne, and the Day-ſtarre ariſe in your hearts.</hi> Now the Morning-Starre, the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> applies to them, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.28. <hi>That is ſuch a glorious preſence of Chriſt, as ſhall ſo inſtruct them, as if they had not need to take heed to the Word of Propheſie.</hi> And in <hi>Revelat.</hi> 21. <hi>They ſhall need no Temple, nor Sunne, nor Moone; for the Lamb is the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the light thereof:</hi> the preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhall bee there, and ſupply all kind of Ordinances. And <hi>Revel.</hi> 7. <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſayes; <hi>Hee will lead them to the Fountaine of living Waters</hi>; all the Ordinances. Here are but the ſtreames and Conduits; then they ſhall be led to the Fountaine. Though we dare not affirme that there ſhal be no Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; yet is there ſome probability at leaſt thus far in compariſon; there ſhall be ſuch a preſence of <hi>Chriſt</hi> there, as therr ſhall not be that need of Ordinances.</p>
            <p>In the tenth place. There ſhall bee the addition of Martyrs, and many of the Worthies of <hi>God</hi> that have lived in former Times ſhall riſe againe. If you read the 7<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Revel.</hi> and 21<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Revel.</hi> you cannot but be convinced of this, That <hi>thoſe that have ſuffered Martyrdome under Antichriſt ſhall have the glory of that time</hi>; and <hi>Daniel</hi> ſhall come up and ſtand in his lot; and as he, ſo many of the Worthies of God in former times: and this ſhall add to the Glory of that time.</p>
            <p>The eleventh is this: There ſhall be moſt bleſſed U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all the Churches of the World. The envy of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and of <hi>Iudah</hi> ſhall be taken away. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 11. <hi>There ſhall be one King; and one Name.</hi> Zach. 14.9. <hi>Wee all profeſſe one Lord, but give him divers Names: but then
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94171:19"/>
there ſhall be one Lord, and his name one.</hi> Zeph. 3.9. <hi>They ſhall ſerve the Lord with one Conſent, with one Shoulder,</hi> it is in the Originall: And if you read that Chapter, you may ſee what Reference it hath to a more glorious Time, than the returning of the Iewes from the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity. Diſſentions in any one Congregation are evill; and for one Church to diſſent from another is a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous evill. Bleſſed will the Time be, when all diſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall bee taken away; and when there ſhall bee a perfect Union of all, and not any diſtinction of <hi>Calvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> or <hi>Lutherans,</hi> or the like: but all ſhall come, and ſerve God, and be called by one <hi>Name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The twelfth is the Reſurrection of the Creatures of the World: and ſo in that regard there ſhall be abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of outward Glory and Proſperity. That place in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. of the <hi>Romans. The Creature groanes under the Burthen that it is in, that it may be delivered into the Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sonnes of God.</hi> When the fulneſſe of the glory of the Adoption of the Sonnes of <hi>God</hi> ſhall come, the <hi>Creatures</hi> ſhall be delivered to them. The whole World is purchaſed by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and purchaſed for the Saints, that is <hi>Chriſts</hi> ayme. <hi>All is yours,</hi> (ſayes the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>) <hi>the whole World:</hi> and therefore, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.7. it is ſaid, <hi>The Saints ſhall inherit all things.</hi> You ſee that the Saints have but little now in the World; now they are the pooreſt and the meaneſt of all; but then when the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doption of the Sonnes of <hi>God</hi> ſhall come in the fulneſſe of it, the World ſhall be theirs; for the World is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for them by <hi>Ieſus Chriſt. Not onely Heaven ſhall be your Kingdome but this World bodily.</hi> And ſo that place, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10. where it is ſaid, <hi>The Heavens ſhall paſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with a great noiſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:94171:19"/>
Heat:</hi> the Apoſtle ſpeakes as if it were the Day of Judgement. But there is one paſſage whereby we may gather that the Apoſtle onely meanes a mighty change that ſhall be before the day of Judgement, <hi>verſe</hi> 13. <hi>We according to his promiſe look for new Heavens and new Earth.</hi> Where hath <hi>God</hi> promiſed a new Heaven, and a new Earth? I know no place in Scripture that I can referre this place unto, but <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 65.15. which is apparant to be meant of the <hi>Church.</hi> Now the Apoſtle ſpeakes of theſe Times, when there ſhall be a mighty change in the World: then ſhall be fulfilled that Promiſe, <hi>There ſhall be new Heavens, and a new Earth.</hi> We can find no ſuch promiſe but in <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and that is meant of the <hi>Church,</hi> and therefore it is probable the Apoſtle meanes that <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſayes, <hi>When the Thouſand yeeres come, the World ſhall bring forth Fruite alone, and the Rocke ſhall diſtill Dew, and no Creature ſhall live upon Prey: the Dog ſhall not hunt, the Child ſhall not be afraid of the Serpent:</hi> making the place of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> which we underſtand metaphorically, to be underſtood, literally, Of the <hi>Wolfe</hi> and the <hi>Lambs</hi> living together, and the <hi>Child</hi> playing upon the Hole of the <hi>Cockatrice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And all the Prayers that ever we put up for the <hi>Church</hi> will be anſwered, and the bleſſing of all will come upon the Churches. Heere we have ſome degree of Bleſſing: But the Bleſſing of all the prayers of the Prophets and Apoſtles will come upon it. In <hi>Iſay,</hi> They were to <hi>cry to God, and give him no reſt, till he made Ieruſalem the praiſe of the whole World:</hi> that is, till God did bring this Time, and Ieruſalem hath not bin ſo lifted up. All theſe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that have not given God reſt all this while, ſhall be anſwered, and Ieruſalem ſhall be advanced.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:94171:20"/>Laſtly, Thoſe glorious <hi>Titles</hi> that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi> hath in the old Teſtament, will be made up to the full; and that is a Reſultance from all the Former. There are many glorious Titles of the Church of <hi>God</hi> in the old Teſtament: Now the eſtate of the Church in the old Teſtament was but Typicall; typifying the eſtate of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> I ſhall name ſome of them, and when thoſe come to be fulfilled, it will be glorious. Firſt the <hi>Lords Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Deut.</hi> 32.9. Secondly his <hi>Pleaſant Portion. Ierem.</hi> 12.10. Thirdly his Inheritance. <hi>Isaiah.</hi> 19.25. <hi>All Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are the Worke of his Hands, But his Church is his Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>the dearely Beloved of his Soule.</hi> Ierem. 12.7. Fiftly, <hi>Gods Treaſure,</hi> and <hi>Peculiar Treaſure,</hi> Exod. 19.5. Sixtly, <hi>His Glory,</hi> Iſaiah, 46.13. Seventhly, <hi>The Houſe of Gods glory,</hi> Iſaiah, 60.7. Eightly, <hi>A Crowne of Glory.</hi> Iſaiah, 62.3. Ninthly, <hi>A Royall Diademe,</hi> in the ſame place. Tenthly, <hi>The glory of God.</hi> Ierem. 3.17. Againe, <hi>The Throne of his Glorie.</hi> Jeremiah, 14.21. Againe, <hi>The Ornament of God:</hi> and <hi>The Beauty of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament,</hi> Ezek. 7.21. Againe, <hi>The Beauty of his Ornament in Majeſtie,</hi> in the ſame place. Now to have all this made up to the full; to ſhew that theſe are no high ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, but rather come ſhort of what will bee: it muſt be a glorious condition.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, Are theſe things true?</p>
            <p>To that wee anſwer; For the truth of them, I will goe no further then this Chapter, <hi>verſe</hi> 9. <hi>Theſe are the true ſayings of God.</hi> It is a very ſtrange Phraſe: If they be the ſayings of God, they muſt needs be true. Were it not enough to ſay they were the ſayings of God, or true ſayings? No, they are the true ſayings of GOD. And in the Originall it is not onely the true ſayings of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:94171:20"/>
               <hi>God</hi>; but the true ſayings of that <hi>God</hi> that is true: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are certaine.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Queſt.</note>But how can they be?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>
               <hi>Zachary,</hi> 8.9. <hi>If it be marvellous in your eyes</hi>; <hi>ſhould it alſo be marvellous in my eyes, ſaith the Lord of Hoaſts? they are marvellous in your eyes; but they are not ſo in mine.</hi> It is <hi>God</hi> Omnipotent that ſhall doe theſe things, by that power, <hi>whereby he is able to ſubdue all things unto himſelfe.</hi> Mountaines ſhall be made plaine, and hee ſhall come skipping over Mountaines, and over difficulties, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall hinder him. And why ſhould you thinke it ſtrange, that theſe things ſhould be, though they bee great: God hath done already as great things as theſe. Certainly Chriſtians that ſhall acknowledge the great and never ſufficiently admired and adored worke of God in the <hi>Hypoſtaticall</hi> Union of the Natures, that <hi>God</hi> ſhould be <hi>Man,</hi> ſhould never aske this Queſtion, how theſe things ſhould be? or to think that any object pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded for our Faith is too difficult.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Queſt.</note>But when ſhall theſe things be?</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Anſw.</note>Truly (Brethren) we hope it is not long before they ſhall bee; and the neerer the Time comes, the more clearly theſe things ſhall bee revealed. And becauſe they begin to be revealed ſo much as they doe now, we have cauſe to hope the Time is at hand. In <hi>Daniel,</hi> 12. God bids <hi>Daniel ſeale his Booke untill the time come,</hi> as if then it ſhould be opened. Doth God begin to open this Booke? Know that the time is at hand. <hi>Iohn</hi> was bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den not to ſeale the Booke, becauſe the Time was at hand. The neerneſſe of the Time at hand diſcovers the Booke; and the neerer the Time, the more it is diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. No place in Scripture gives us ſo much light to
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94171:21"/>
know when this ſhall be as <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.11. <hi>And from the time that the dayly Sacrifices ſhall be taken away, and the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that maketh deſolate ſet up; there ſhall bee a thouſand, two hundred and ninety dayes.</hi> What is the meaning of this? The light that I have from this, I acknowledge to be from that worthy Inſtrument of God Mr. <hi>Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> A day is uſually taken for a yeare, and ſo many dayes as were ſet, ſo many yeares it ſhould be. All the queſtion is about the beginning of the time. This abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of deſolation was in <hi>Julians</hi> time 360. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe then <hi>Iulian</hi> would ſet up the Temple againe that was deſtroyed, in deſpight of the Chriſtians, and would ſet up the Iewiſh Religion againe: That was the abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of deſolation, ſayes he; and the whole Iewiſh Religion was not conſumed till that time. Now reckon ſo many yeeres according to the Number of the dayes, it comes to, 1650. and it is now 1641. and that place for the abomination of deſolation is like to bee it as any that can be named. But it is ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed is he that comes to another Number:</hi> 1335. dayes, that is 45. years more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that is, ſayes he in 1650. they ſhall begin; but it ſhall bee 45. yeares, before it comes to full Head, and bleſſed is hee that comes to this Day. And he hath hit right in other things, as never the like, in making <hi>Sardis</hi> to be the Church of <hi>Germany,</hi> and foretold from thence how things would fall out, and wee ſee now are. Now we have alſo a voyce from the Multitude, as from the Waters, and it begins to come from the Thundrings.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seeing theſe things ſhall be, what manner of perſons ought we to be</hi>? That is the worke I intended to have done, to have ſhewed you the Duties, theſe things call for at our Hands. If <hi>God</hi> hath ſuch an intention to glorifie his
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94171:21"/>
Church, and that in this World: Oh, let every one ſay to his owne heart; <hi>What manner of perſons ought wee to be</hi>? and eſpecially, <hi>What manner of perſons ought yee to be</hi>? becauſe you are beginning this deſpiſed Worke, gathering a <hi>Church</hi> together, which way <hi>God</hi> will ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Certainly, the Communion of <hi>Saints,</hi> and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency of Congregations <hi>God</hi> will honour.</p>
            <p>And this Worke is a Foundation of abundance of glory that <hi>God</hi> ſhall have, and will continue till the comming of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> And bleſſed are they that are now content to keep the Word of Gods Patience. And doe you keep the Word of Gods Patience, though you ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for it, as you now doe. And wait, the Text ſayes, Thoſe that teſtifie againſt <hi>Antichriſt</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme,</hi> and keep the Word of <hi>Gods</hi> Patience, <hi>God</hi> will keep them in the houre of Temptation, hee will make them a <hi>Pillar</hi> in his Houſe, and they ſhall never goe out; <hi>God</hi> will open their dore, ſo as none ſhall ſhut it till the comming of <hi>Chriſt:</hi> and hee will write upon them the Name of <hi>the new</hi> IERVSALEM. Therfore keep the Word of <hi>Gods</hi> Patience now you have an opportunity in your hands for furthering this great Worke. Take heed that you looſe not this opportunity: certainly, if there ſhould fall out any juſt cauſe amongſt you of ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall in regard of Diviſions, or any other way, you may do more hurt to hinder this glorious Work, then all the Perſecutors could doe. For you will perſwade the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of Men, that this is not a Way of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors cannot doe ſo. So that the Governours of <hi>Iudah</hi> wil not ſay, <hi>Our ſtrength is in the Inhabitants of</hi> Ieruſalem, <hi>thoſe that profeſſe themſelves to be the People of</hi> Ieruſalem.</p>
