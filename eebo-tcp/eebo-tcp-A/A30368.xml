            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An ENQUIRY into the Reasons for Abrogating the TEST imposed on all Members of Parliament.</head>
            <byline>Offered by <hi>Sa. Oxon.</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>WHEN the <hi>Cardinals</hi> in <hi>Rome</hi> go abroad without <hi>Fiocco's</hi> on their Horses heads, it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood that they will be then <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognito,</hi> and they expect nothing of that Respect which is payed them on other Occasions. So since there is no <hi>Fiocco</hi> at the Head of this <hi>Discourse,</hi> no Name nor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation, it seems the Writer offers him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be examined without those nice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards, that may be due to the Dignity he bears: and indeed when a Man forgets what he is himself, it is very natural for others to do it likewise.</p>
            <p>It is no wonder to see those of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Communion</hi> be stir themselves, so much as they do, to be delivered from the <hi>Test,</hi> and every thing else that is uneasie to them: and tho othres may find it very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to oppose themselves, in all the just and legal ways that agree with our Constitution, to this Design, yet it is so na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to all that are under any Pressure, to desire to get free from it, that at the same time that we cannot forbear to withstand them, we cannot much condemn them: but it raises nature a little, to see a <hi>Man</hi> that has been so long fatned with the <hi>Spoils</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> and who has now got up to a degree so disproportioned to his Merit, to turn so treacherously upon it. If he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready weary of his <hi>comfortable importance,</hi> and will here give her into the bargain, and declare himself, no body will be sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prised at the change of his masque, since he has taken much pains to convince the World, that his <hi>Religion</hi> goes no deeper than his <hi>Habit</hi>: yet tho his confidence is of a piece with all his other Vertues, few thought it could have carried him so far; I confess I am not surprized, but rather wonder to see that others should be so; for he has given sufficient Warning of what he is capable of; he has told the World <hi>what is the worst thing that Dr.</hi> Burnet <hi>can do.</hi> p. 50. but I am sure the <hi>Dr.</hi> cannot be quit with him, to tell what is the <hi>worst thing</hi> that he can do; it must needs be a very fruitful Fancy that can find out all the degrees of Wickedness to which he can go: And tho' this Pamphlet is a good Essay of his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent that way, yet that <hi>Terra Incognita</hi> is boundless. In the <hi>Title Page</hi> it is said that this was <hi>first writ for the Author's own Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and now published for the benefit of all others whom it may concern.</hi> But the words are certainly wrong placed; for the truth of the matter is, That it was <hi>written for the Author's own benefit, and that it is now published for the satisfaction of all others whom it may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern:</hi> In some sense perhaps it was written for the Author's own Satisfaction; for so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulant and so depraved a mind as His, is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being delighted with His Treachery and a poor Bishoprick with the addition of: <hi>Presidentship,</hi> being too low a Prize for His Ambition and Avarice. He resolved to assure Himseif of the first great Bishoprick that falls; the <hi>Liege Letter</hi> let us see how far the <hi>Iesuits</hi> were assured of him, and how much courted by him: and that he said, <hi>that none but</hi> Athiests <hi>supported the Protestant Religion now in</hi> England; yet how many soever of these may be among us, He is upon the point of lessening their number, by one at least: and he takes care to justifie the Hopes which these <hi>Fathers</hi> conceived of Him. They are severe Masters, and will not be put

Oxon,</hi> to arraign that <hi>House,</hi> with all the Insolence to which He can raise his wanton Pen. Laws that are in being are treated with respect, even by those who move for their Repeal; but our <hi>Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                  </gap>ansir</hi> scorns that modest strain, He is not contented to arraign the <hi>Law,</hi> but calls it <hi>Barbarous,</hi> and says, <hi>that nothing can be more Barbarous and Prophane than to make the renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of a Mystery, so unanimously received, a</hi> State Test; <hi>pag.</hi> 133. <hi>pag.</hi> 64. But he ought to have avoided the word <hi>Prophane,</hi> since it leads men to remember, that He had taxed the praying for the King, <hi>as under God and Christ, as Crude,</hi> not to say <hi>Prophane</hi>: when in the prospect He had then [36] of a Bishoprick he raised the King above Christ, but now another prospect, will make Him sink Him beneath the <hi>Pope,</hi> who is but at best Christs Vicar. But this is not all, there comes another Flower that is worthy of Him, He tells us, <hi>That the</hi> TEST <hi>was the First-born of</hi> Oats<hi>'s Plot, and brought forth on purpose to give Credit and Reputation to the Perjury,</hi> pag. 5. and because this went in common between the <hi>Two Houses,</hi> He bestows a more particular mark of His Favour on the <hi>House of Lords</hi>: and tells them <hi>That this was a Monument erected by themselves in honour of so gross an Imposture.</hi> (ibid.) But after all, the Royal <hi>Assent</hi> was added; and here no doubt it itched some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, for if it had not been for the manner of the Late <hi>King</hi>'s Death, and the Papers pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished since His <hi>Death,</hi> He would have wreaked His Malice upon <hi>His Memory,</hi> for He will never forgive His not Advancing him: And the Late King being so true a Judg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of Wit, could not but be much taken with the best <hi>Satyr</hi> of our Time; and saw that <hi>Bays's Wit,</hi> when measured with anothers, was of a piece with hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Vertues, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore judged in favour of the <hi>Rehearsal Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pros'd</hi>: this went deep, and though it gave occasion to the single piece of Modesty, with which he can be charged, of withdrawing from the Town, and not importuning the Press more for some years, since even a Face of Brass must grow red, when it is so Burnt as his was then; yet his Malice against the Elder Brother was never extinguished but with his Life: But now a strange conjuncture has brought him again on the Stage, and <hi>Bays</hi> will be <hi>Bays</hi> still.</p>
            <p>He begins his Prologue with the only soft word in the whole piece, <hi>I humbly conceive,</hi> but he quickly repents him of that <hi>Debonarity,</hi> and so makes <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Lightning</hi> speak the rest, as if his Designs were to Insult over the two Houses, and not to convince them. He who is one of the Punies of his Order<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is certainly one of its justest Reproaches, tells us pag. 8. <q>That to the shame of the Bishops, this Law was consented to by them in the House of Lords:</q> But what shame is due to him, who has treated that Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Bench,</hi> and in particular his <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> in so scurrilous a manner. The Order has much more cause to be ashamed of such a Member: tho if there are two or three such as he is among the Twenty six, they may Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort themselves with this, That a dozen of <hi>much berter</hi> Men, had one among them, that I confess was not <hi>much worse,</hi> if it was not for this, That he let the price of his Treachery fall much lower than <hi>Sa. Oxon</hi> does, who is still true to his Old <hi>Maxim,</hi> that he delivered in Answer to one who asked him <q>What was the best Body of Divinity? which was, That that which could help a man to keep a Coach and six Horses, was certainly the best, But now I come to Examine his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons for abrogating the TEST.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The first is, <q>That it is con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rary to the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Rights of Peerage,</hi> and turns the Birth-Right of the <hi>English</hi> Nobility, into a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious Title: which is at the mercy of every Faction and Passion in Parliament, and that therefore, how useful soever the TEST might have been in its season, it sometime must prove a very ill President against the Right of Peerage: and upon this he tells a story of a Protestation made in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101254:2"/>
the House of Lords, against the TEST, that was brought in, in 1675, together with the Resolution of the House against that Penalty upon the Peers, of loosing their Votes in case of a Refusal: he represents this, as a Test or Oath of Loyalty, against the Lawfulness of taking Arms upon any pretence whatsoever against the King.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But in Answer to all this, one would gladly know what are the <hi>Natural Rights</hi> of <hi>Peerage,</hi> and in what Chapter of the Law of Nature they are to be found, for if those Rights have no other Warrant, but the Constitution of this Government, then they are still subject to the Legislative Authority, and may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by it. The Right of Peerage is still in the Family, only as the exercise of it is limited by the Law to such an Age, so it may be sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended as oft as the Publick Safety comes to require it: even the indelible Character it self, may be brought under a total Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, of which our Author may, perhaps, afford an instance at some time or other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Votes in either House of Parliament, are never to be put in Ballance with Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish'd Laws: these are but the Opinions of One House, and are changeable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But if the TEST might have been useful in its Season, one would gladly see how it should be so soon out of Season: for its chief Use being to Secure the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Religion in 1678. it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, That now in 1688. the Dangers are so quite dissipated, that there is no more need of Securing it. In one Sense we are in a Safer Condition than we were then: for some False Brethren have shewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and have lost that little Credit which some unhappy Accidents had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It was not the Loyalty in the TEST of the Year 1675. that raised the greatest Opposition to it: but another part of it, <q>That they should never Endeavour any Alteration in the Government, either in the Church or State.</q> Now it seemed to be an unreasonable Limitation on the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative Body, to have the <hi>Members</hi> engaged to make no Alteration: And it is that which would not have much pleased those, <hi>For whose Satisfaction this Book is published.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The second Reason was already hinted at, <hi>of its dishonourable Birth and Original</hi>; pag. 10. which according to the decency of his stile he calls <hi>the first Sacrament of the Otesian Villany,</hi> pag. 9. This he aggravates <hi>as such a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous and Inhuman piece of Barbarity as could never have entred into the thoughts of any man but the infamous Author of it</hi>; this piece of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, tho it belongs to this Reason, comes in again in his Fourth Reason, <hi>Pag.</hi> 6. and to let the <hi>House of Lords</hi> see their Fate, if they will not yield to his <hi>Reasons,</hi> he tells them that this will be not only an <q>Eternal National Reproach, but such a blot upon the <hi>Peers,</hi> that no length of time could wear away, nothing but the Universal Conoagration could destroy,</q> which are the aptest Expressions that I know to mark how deeply, the many blots with which he is stigmatized are rooted in his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The wanton man in his <hi>Drawcansir</hi> humor thinks that <hi>Parliaments</hi> and a <hi>House of Peers</hi> are to be treated by him with as much Scorn as is justly due to himself. But to set this matter in its true Light, it is to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that in 1678. there were besides the Evidences of the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> a great many other Discoveries made of <hi>Letters</hi> and <hi>Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations</hi> in Forreign Parts, chiefly in the Courts of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> for Extirpating the <hi>Protestant Religion;</hi> upon which the <hi>Parts</hi> that was most united to the <hi>Court,</hi> set on this Law, for the <hi>Test,</hi> as that which was both in it self a just and necessary Security for the Establish'd <hi>Religion,</hi> and that would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably lay the fermentation which was then in the Nation: and the <hi>Act</hi> was so little ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to Him, whom he calls <hi>its Author,</hi> that he spake of it then with Contempt, as a <hi>Trick</hi> of the Court to lay the <hi>Nation</hi> too soon asleep. The Negotiations beyond Sea were too evidently proved to be denied; and (which is not yet generally known) Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> when Examined by the <hi>Committee</hi> of the House of <hi>Commons,</hi> said plain enough to them, that the Late <hi>King</hi> was concerned in them; but the <hi>Committee</hi> would not look into that matter, and so Mr. <hi>Sacheverill,</hi> that was their Chair-man, did not report it; yet the thing was not so secret but that one to whom it was trusted, gave the Late King an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it; who said, That he had not heard of it any other way, and was so fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101254:3"/>
that the Nation had cause given them to be jealous, that he himself set forward the <hi>Act,</hi> and the rather because he saw that the <hi>E.</hi> of <hi>S.</hi> did not much like it. The <hi>Parliament</hi> as long as it was known that the <hi>Religion</hi> was safe in the <hi>Kings</hi> Negative, had not taken any great Care of its own Constitution, but it seemed the best Expedient that could be found, for laying the Jealousies of His Late <hi>Majesty,</hi> and the apprehensions of the <hi>Successor,</hi> to take so much Care of the <hi>Two Houses,</hi> that so the Dangers with which men were than allarm'd, might seem the less for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, upon so effectual a Security: and thus all the stir that He keeps with <hi>Perjury</hi> and <hi>Imposture,</hi> ought to make no other impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but to shew the wantonness of His own Temper, that meddles so boldly with things of which He knew so little the true Secret: For here was a <hi>Law</hi> passed of which all made great use that opposed <hi>the Bill of Exclusion,</hi> to demonstrate to the Nation that there could be no Danger of <hi>Popery,</hi> even under a <hi>Prince</hi> of that <hi>Religion</hi>; but as he would turn the matter, it amounts to this, That that <hi>Law</hi> might be of good use in that season, to lay the Jealousies of the Nation, till there were a <hi>Prince</hi> on the Throne of that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> and then when the turn is served, it must be thrown away, to open the only door that is now shut upon the Re-Establishment of that <hi>Religion.</hi> This is but one Hint among a great many more of the state of Affairs at the time that this <hi>Act</hi> of the TEST was made, shew that the <hi>Evidence</hi> given by the <hi>Witnesses,</hi> had no other share in that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but that it gave a rise to the other Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries; and a fair Opportunity to those who knew the Secret of the Late <hi>King</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the Negotiation at <hi>Dover,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide such an effectual Security, as might both save the <hi>Crown,</hi> and secure the <hi>Religion</hi>: and this I am sure some of the <hi>Bishops</hi> knew, who <hi>(to their Honour</hi>) were faithful to both.</p>

Did the <hi>Parliament</hi> pretend by this <hi>Act</hi> to make any Decision in those two Points of <hi>Transub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiation</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi>? Had not the <hi>Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> defined them both for above an Age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? In the 28<hi>th Article</hi> of our <hi>Church</hi> these words are to be found: <hi>Transubstantiatien (or the change of the substance of Bread and Wine) in the Supper of the Lord, cannot be proved by Holy Writ; but it is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthrows the nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hath given occasion to many Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>; and for the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that was also declared very expresly in the same Body of <hi>Articles</hi>: since in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle 35 the <hi>Homiliys</hi> are declared <q>to contain a godly and wholesome Doctrine necessary for those times: and upon that it is judged that they should be read in the Churches by the Ministers, diligently and distinctly, that they may be understood of the People.</q> And the Second of these, which is against the <hi>Peril of Idolatry,</hi> aggravates the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of that <hi>Church</hi> in so many particulars, and with such severe Expressions, that those who at first made those <hi>Articles,</hi> and all those who do now sign them, or oblige others to sign 'em, must either believe the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> to be guilty of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> or that the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is the Impudentest Society that ever assumed the Name of a <hi>Church,</hi> if she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses such <hi>Homilies</hi> to the People, in which this Charge is given so home, and yet does not believe it Her Self. A man must be of <hi>Bays</hi>'s pitch to rise up to this degree of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence. Upon the whole matter then, these points had been already determined, and were a part of our <hi>Doctrine</hi> enacted by <hi>Law</hi>: all that the <hi>Parliament</hi> did, was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to take these out of a great many more that by this <hi>Test</hi> it might appear whether they who came into either <hi>House</hi> were of that <hi>Religion</hi> or not, and now let our <hi>Reasoner</hi> try what he <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

When one reflects on <hi>two</hi> of the <hi>Bishops,</hi> that were of that Venerable Body, while this <hi>Act</hi> passed, whose Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will be blessed in the present and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ages, those two great and good Men that filled the <hi>Sees</hi> of <hi>Chester</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> he must conclude, that as the World was not worthy of them, so certainly their <hi>Sees</hi> were not worthy of them, since they have been plagued with such <hi>Successors</hi>; that because <hi>Bays</hi> delights in Figures taken from the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Empire, I must tell him, that since <hi>Commodus</hi> suceeded to <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> I do not find a more incongrous Succession in History.

That the Charge of <hi>Forgery</hi> falls back on the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soner, since as to <hi>Cranmers</hi> opinion of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> his own Books, and his Dispute at Oxford are such plain evidences, that none but <hi>Bays</hi> could have questioned it: and for his being an <hi>Erastian,</hi> Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> had clearly proved that he had changed his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in that point, so that tho he shewed that he had been indeed once engaged in those Opinions, yet he proved that he had forsaken them: Let the Reader judge to whom the charge of <hi>Forgery</hi> belongs. 2.

These two particulars here mentioned, bear so inconsiderable a share in that History, and have been so little minded, that I dare say of an hundred that are pleased with that Work, there is not one that will assign these as their Motives.</p>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:101254:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>And thus I think enough is said in Answer to His impertinent digression upon <hi>Transubstanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi> let Him renounce the <hi>Article</hi> of our <hi>Church,</hi> and all that he possesses in Consequence to His having signed it, and then we will argue all the rest with Him upon the square: but as long as He owns that, He is bound likewise to own the first Branch of the TEST, which is the Renouncing of <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi> In this Discourse He makes His old Hatred to <hi>Calvin</hi> and the <hi>Calvinists</hi> return so often, that ít ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears very Conspicuously. I believe it is stronger now than ever, and that for a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular reason: When the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Prircess</hi> of <hi>Orange</hi> were Married, he was perhaps the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Man in <hi>England</hi> that expressed his uneasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness at that Happy Conjunction, in so Clown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish a manner, that when their <hi>Highnesses</hi> past thro <hi>Canterbury</hi> he would not go with the rest of that Body, to which he was so long a Blemish, to pay his Duty to them, and when He was Asked the Reason, he said, <hi>He could have no regard to a Calvinist Prince.</hi> Now this <hi>Calvinist Prince</hi> has declared his mind so openly and fully against the <hi>Repeal of the Test,</hi> that no doubt this has encreased <hi>Bays</hi>'s distemper, and heightned his Choler against the Whole Party.</p>
            <p>The second Branch of the TEST is the Declaration made of the <hi>Idolatry committed in the Roman Church:</hi> upon which he tells us, pag. 71.72. That <hi>Idolatry is a Stabbing and Cut-throat Word, a<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d that it is an Inviting and Warranting the Rabble whenever Opportunity fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to destroy the Roman Catholicks</hi>; and here <hi>Bays</hi> will outdo himself, since this was a Master-piece of Service, therefore he makes the taxing the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> with Idolatry, <hi>a piece of inh<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>manity that outdoes the Savages of the Canibals themselves; and damns at once both Body and Soul.</hi> He Charges Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> as the <hi>great Founder of this, and all other Anti-catholick and Antichristian and uncharitable Principles among us, and that the Test is the Swearing to the Truth of his unlearned and Fanatick Nation of Idolatry. pag.</hi> 130.135. and the result of all is, <hi>That Idolatry made the Plot, and then the Plot made Idolatry, and that the <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lingfleet</hi> was Born; and tho perhaps none has ever defended the <hi>charge,</hi> with so much Learning as he has done, yet no malice less Impudent than his is, eould make him the Author of the Accu<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation. It will be ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther strain of our Authors modesty, if he will pretend that our Church is not bound to own the Doctrine that is contained in h<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r <hi>Homilies,</hi> he must by this maxe our Church as Treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to her Members, as <hi>Sa. Oxon</hi> is to her, or to deliver this Doctrine to the people, if we believe it not our selves, is to be as Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as he himself can pretend to be. A Church may believe a Doctrine which she does not think necessary to propose to all her Members; but she were indeed a Society fit for such Pastors as he is, if she could propose to the people a Doctrine, chiefly one of so great consequence as this is, without she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it her Self. So then he must either Renounce our Church and her <hi>Articles,</hi> or he must Answer all his own Plea for clearing that Church of this Imputation: which is so slight, that it will be no hard matter even for such a trifling Writer as himself is, to do it: As for what he says of Stabbing and Cut-throat Words, he may charge us with such words, if he will, but we know who we may charge with the Deeds. I would gladly see the List of all that have been murdered by these Words, to try if they can be put in the Ballance, either with the <hi>Massacre</hi> of <hi>Ireland,</hi> or that of <hi>Paris</hi>; upon which I must take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his slight way of mentioning <hi>Coligny, and Faction,</hi> and telling us in plain words, pag. 45. "That they were Rebells, this is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps another instance of his kindness to the <hi>Calvinist Prince,</hi> that is descended from that Great Man.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Idolatry made our Plot,</hi> it was not the first that is made; but his malignity is still like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, his charging Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> who he says is the Author of the Imputation of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> as if he had suborned the <hi>Evidence in our Plot.</hi> I should congratulate to the Dr. the Honour that is done him by the Malice of one who must needs be the object of the Hatred of all good Men, if I did not look upon Him as so contemptible a person, that his love and his hatred are equally insignificant. If he thinks our Church worse than Canibals, I wish he would be at the pains to go and make a trial, and see whether these Salvages will use him as we have done. I dare say they would not Eat him, for they would find so much Gall and Choler in him, that the first bit would quite disgust them.</p>
