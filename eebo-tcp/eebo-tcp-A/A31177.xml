            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The <hi>CASE</hi> of the Poor Widdows and Orphans of the City of <hi>LONDON.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THere are about fourteen hundred Orphans, whoſe Portions left them by their Parents, were forced into the Chamber of <hi>London,</hi> under pretence of Security, but have for ſome years been unjuſtly detained from them; ſo that many young Men who are out of their Apprenticeſhips, for want of their Moneys cannot ſet up their Trades, whereby they are lyable to take ill and Vicious Courſes; and many young Gentlewomen who have Thouſands of Pounds in the Chamber, have been forced to go to Service for a Livelihood, though by their former Breeding and Education very unfit for ſuch Imployment; and ſeveral being deſtitute of both Father and Mother, are fain to live upon the Charity of Friends, and divers poor Widows are diſabled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their Children, for want of the Supply the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>London</hi> ought to pay them for Finding Money; ſo that they are ready to beg their Bread.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore they moſt humbly Implore your tender Compaſſion to Relieve them, and to ſearch into the Cauſes of their great Sufferings; and though ſome do pretend that we were not forced to bring in our Moneys, yet it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently apparent that not one in Twenty could procure ſuch large and unreaſonable Security as they inſiſted on; and ſeveral they have made to acknowledge Satisfaction, and then not payd them their Moneys; and when they knew their Charter was going, and the Chamber in ſo low a Condition, yet have made ſome to bring in their Moneys. There are many other Grievances, which for brevity we omit, and do humbly rely for Relief (under God) on his moſt Gracious Majeſty and this Honourable Aſſembly.</hi>
