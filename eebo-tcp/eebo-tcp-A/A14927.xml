            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Feeling, complaining, ſtriuing? and yet no tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes? all hard ſtill? This is very ſtrange.

Is it poſsible, thinke you, that

theſe things ſhould ſtand with any tendernes of heart, or any ſanctified affection?</hi>

               <p>This were a hard caſe indeed, if it proceeded from a mans habituall diſpoſition, not from ſome extraordinary diſtemper. But conſidering how far a man may be ſway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by occaſion of ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cauſe, and how farre he may be deluded in diſcerning his owne eſtate: it is not alway ſafe for one to iudge of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe by his preſent ſenſe and feeling: but eſpecially in theſe three Caſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In the time of his firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion; when grace is as ſeed newly caſt into the earth; and a Chriſtian like an Infant for want of exerciſe, and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence it may bee, ſcarſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he hath. Then as the
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:3452:40"/>
land newly ſowen, little differs from other ground in ſhew, ſo a Chriſtian ſeemes little dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from other men: or as childrens complaints are not euer to be taken for Rules, ſo the complainings of ſuch a one, doe not infallibly euince the want which he complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth of.</p>
               <p n="2">2. After the committing of ſome groſſe ſin, or neglect of the meanes of grace, &amp; lying therein without remorſe for a time. Then a Chriſtian is as on in a ſwoune, or faſt aſleepe: if his life be in him, it ſcarſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares, at leaſt he perceiues it not himſelfe; the ſpirit though not extinguiſhed, yet inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting his worke for a time.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In ſome vehement per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of the mind, either by tentation, or melancholy,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:3452:40"/>
which many times is ſeconded by tentation too; whereby Satan labours to blinde the eyes of a Chriſtian, that he may not ſee, and take comfort in his owne happines. Then, as in Warre, the noiſe of a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non ſtupifies the bodily ſenſes, ſo while Satan is continually buzzing in a mans eares, his violent and importunate ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, he is not able to hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the gracious promiſes of God, or any thing that might ſound to his comfort. Nay, as it fals out ſometimes in naturall melancholy, that men haue ſtrange imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as to thinke themſelues dead, to haue no heads, &amp;c. So, and much more then ſo are men deluded, when Satan ſeconds their melancholy conceits with ſtrong deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:3452:41"/>
which may well take the deeper impreſſion, by how much the things conceiued, are leſſe ſubiect vnto, and conſequently hardlier con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by ſenſe. In ſuch caſes as theſe, a man may haue grace, and yet not diſcerne it, may perſwade himſelfe, and peremptorily ſtand to it, that he hath none at all.</p>

               <p>It is true indeede, when the conſcience rightly infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, doth checke, accuſe, condemne, there is no hope of auoyding the ſentence of God, by any cloſe carriage, by which we might thinke to ſhift, and hide our ſelues, and our actions from his eyes. Yet
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:3452:41"/>
this hinders not, but that ſometimes the conſcience may condemne, where God doth not. For though it alway iudge for God, and on his ſide, yet it doth not alway iudge with God, and according to his direction: but ſometimes,<note place="margin">

               <p>It is euen time then to fall from comforting to chiding of you. What? Muſt you needs haue ſuch perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of holines, as God affords not to his Church militant, or els will you be vnthankefull, and impatient? Why, you muſt know, that our ſanctification here is but begun, the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of it is reſerued to the ſtate of glory. If we here haue any perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it conſiſts in the imptation of Chriſts righteouſnes, God gracious

It is indeed a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable care, that no iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie raigne in vs, but intolerable pride, to thinke ſtrange, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny remaines in vs. What mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes were it, to burne the corne, becauſe ſome weeds grow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt it? for an vlcer in the skin, to thruſt a lancer into the heart? in puniſhing the guiltie mother, to deſtroy the innocent babe in her wombe? And is it not as bad, falling out with the fleſh, to wrecke your anger on the ſpirit? through hatred of corrupt nature, to offer violence to the new creater? in a word, to giue oueral, &amp; take no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in any thing, becauſe all is not as you would haue it What
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:3452:43"/>
if God be pleaſed by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent indiſpoſition, to labour the cure of ſome more dangerous diſeaſe in you? will you quarrel with your Phiſician? You may remember perhaps, there was a time, when you had a vaine conceit of free-will, &amp; naturall abilitie to beleeue, and repent at pleaſure; &amp; of this you haue not yet throughly repented: if this be ſo, what can God doe leſſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by your preſent dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to ſhew you,<note place="margin">

               <p>Firſt, Labour to finde out that particular error, or corruption, which God may aime at in this withdrawing the light of his countenance from you; and be humbled for that: perhaps when that cloud is diſpelled, the Sunne will ſhew forth his beames againe.</p>
