         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

or abſolute, is, ſaith<note n="a" place="margin">Vind. Ley Lect. 26. pag. 249.</note> Mr.
<hi>Burges,</hi> a very troubleſome queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
So indeede it proves in places
where it is vented. It troubles the
faith of ſome, the lives of others,
and the peace of very many.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>New England</hi> hath felt the troubles
it occaſioned; And many places in old England are now
ſuffering. I could therefore from my heart have wiſhed
that either none at all had broached it in theſe parts, or
if it muſt have beene publiſhed, ſome other, rather then
you, my deareſt Friend and Reverend Brother, might have
beene the Author of that, meerly out of the great reſpect
and entire affection I beare unto you. But ſeeing you
have not only ſet it on foote, but when a modeſt defence
was made of the contrary Doctrine, without any either
bitter invective againſt your tenent, or ſo much as reply
unto your Arguments; you in divers Sermons renewed the
quarrel, replied unto the Arguments of the contrary
ſide; not ſparing to aſperſe them in too open a manner.</p>
                  <p>I thought it my duty I owe to truth, oppugned by, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
my love unto you, to let you know, both
wherein your Reply appears unſatisfactory unto me, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:167980:2"/>
wherein offenſive. Of the latter in the firſt place, which
is as followes.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in the whole ſeries of your diſcourſe, you ſeemed to
me to rank thoſe of our Divines, who hold the covenant of
grace to have conditions, in the ſame file, with <hi>Arminians,</hi>
as if both had maintained the ſame conditionate redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or ſalvability; wherein, whether you dealt fairly, I
refer it to your conſcience to conſider. Now, though
I do not doubt, but that you know full well already how
farre we differ from them: yet ſhall I ſet downe the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in ſome particulars, and then endeavour to ſatisfie
your Arguments, ſo farre as they ſeeme to reflect upon
our Tenents. The Salvability or potentiall and
conditionate redemption maintained by the Arminians,
may (I conceive) be reduced to theſe four particulars.</p>
                  <p>1. That Chriſt in dying, intended not the ſalvation of
any particular perſons.</p>
                  <p>2. That the end of his death was not to bring ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
to ſalvation, but only that God thereby might have
power (his juſtice being ſatisfied) to give remiſſion of ſins
to ſinful man, on what conditions he pleaſed. So that
Chriſt might have had his end, though never a man had
been actually ſaved.</p>
                  <p>3. That this is the will of God, that none ſhould
enjoy remiſſion of ſins, but on condition of faith.</p>
                  <p>4. That Chriſt hath purchaſed faith and regeneration
for none, but remiſſion and reconciliation for all, which
they ſhall actually partake of, who do believe. Nor is there
neede of infuſing any ſpiritual vitall, principle into the
hearts of men to enable them to believe, they may doe it
of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The third excepted, which of theſe poſitions
is maintained by any of thoſe our Divines that hold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
to be in the new Covenant? Nay, they all main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
that Chriſt in dying, intended the actual ſalvation of
particular perſons, viz. of all thoſe whom God from all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity
had choſen. That for all thoſe Chriſt hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the actuall application of ſalvation to them, as well
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:167980:2"/>
as the purchaſe of it for them; which actual enjoyment
of ſalvation, being according to Gods appointment to be
obtained in a way of faith, or upon condition of faith, by
or through faith, as the Scripture ſpeaks. They further
averre, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by his death, hath alſo
obtaind at God the Fathers hands, that the bleſſed Spirit
ſhould in time work this faith in the hearts of his choſen,
that ſo through faith they might come actually to partake
of all the benefits which he hath purchaſed for them.</p>
                  <p>So then, <hi>Arminians</hi> maintain conditions to be performed
by us of our own power: Such ours diſclaim, maintaining
that it is God that worketh in us both to wil and to do. <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi>
maintain conditions ſo as if the efficacie of Chriſts
death were pendulous thereon; This alſo ours diſavow,
maintaining that Chriſt hath purchaſed both ſalvation to
be given upon condition, and ability alſo to be given to
perform that condition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Ames coron. artic. 1. c. 1. § 4</note> 
                     <hi>Arminians</hi> maintaine conditions preceding Gods very
electing us to ſalvation. But ours maintaine conditions
antecedent of actual ſalvation indeed, but conſequent in
regard of Election.</p>
                  <p>The difference between our Divines and the Arminians
about conditions being thus great, as hath beene ſhewed,
I think it would have been fair dealing in you to have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
them, &amp; not have crowded them together into one and
the ſame refutation, as if they had mantained one and the
ſame thing. Do you not think the friends of <hi>Pemble,
Preſton, Ames, Perkins, Ball,</hi> &amp;c. would take it ill to have
them refuted under the title of <hi>Arminians,</hi> and for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
Arminian Salvability (a notion more abhorring
to their ſpirits then to your owne, and which ſome of
them have expreſly written againſt?) yet do they all hold
conditions in the Covenant. And you refute all ſuch, who
hold ſo, under that head and title. I challenge you to
ſhew me any one of ours, that in pleading for conditions
in the Covenant, doth in the leaſt degree aſſert that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionate
Redemption or Arminian Salvability.</p>
                  <p>Before you come to our Arguments, you tell us, that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:167980:3"/>
though you are againſt conditions, yet you hold that God
hath his order and method in conferring of his benefits.
And that in regard of this order one benefit may depend
upon an other, &amp;c. And that none are ſaved but ſuch as
do repent and believe.</p>
                  <p>I was heartily glad to heare ſo much from you: for this
is the maine I contend for, That God gives faith, and then
ſalvation; And that ſalvation depends on faith, and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in order of nature followes faith. And here I would
argue <hi>ex conceſſis.</hi> Thoſe benefits which according to that
method and order of conferring that the Lord hath ſet
down to himſelfe, muſt goe before other, and on which
others do depend; Thoſe (I ſay) are required in us, before
the other which do depend on them, and follow them, can
be obtained by us.</p>
                  <p>But faith and repentance are benefits which according
to this method of God are given before Salvation, and on
which ſalvation doth depend.</p>
                  <p>And therefore faith and repentance are actually requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in us, before we can actually partake of Remiſſion, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation.
Juſtification, and other benefits and branches
of Salvation purchaſed by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>It this were granted, that they are required, and that to
the obtaining of Salvation (which muſt needs be granted,
the benefit of Salvation not only following them, but alſo
depending on them as you confeſſe) let them be required,
as conditions, or as ſomething elſe in Gods method and
order; I would not ſtrive about termes. But I feate that
you had here your reſerve, and that you underſtand this
priority of one benefit before an other, and this depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of one benefit upon an other, either in reference to
the manifeſtation of ſalvation, or the perfection of that,
and not in reference to the beginning and being of them;
for ſo much ſome following paſſages hint out unto us; of
which we ſhall ſpeak more when we come unto them.
Not long after, you challenge Malice it ſelfe to ſhew, if it
can, any one of your ſide that maintains ſalvation without
repentance and faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:167980:3"/>
And here Sir, if I ſhould produce ſome that doe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
it, ſhould I not very prittely get me the odious
name of malicious? Wel, the Lord give us to hate the
affect and fact as much as we doe the name. Truth is truth,
and muſt be diſcovered. And I would to God there were
not too many expreſſions vented both in Pulpits and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
too much tending this way.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>I find in Mr.</hi> Saltmarſh, Free grace. <hi>p.</hi> 102. Do not the
promiſes belong to ſinners as ſinners? And <hi>p.</hi> 104. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of Chriſt are held forth to ſinners, as ſinners; not as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting
ſinners, or humble ſinners. <hi>p.</hi> 105. Whatever promiſe
hath a condition in it, is ours in Chriſt, who only is the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
perſon for all promiſes. <hi>p.</hi> 84. So as we are to believe
our repentance true in him, who hath repented for us. <hi>p.</hi> 126
All the conditions were on Chriſts part, none on ours. <hi>So p.</hi> 153
In the new Covenant God gives himſelf freely in Chriſt,
undertaking all both with the Father and the Soule, nothing
being required on mans part. <hi>Occaſional word:</hi> That thoſe
Miniſters who preſſe repentance and faith, do overheate the
wine of the Goſpel with conditions and qualifications, ſo the
poore ſoules cannot taſte it. <hi>So alſo in</hi> Doctor Criſpe, <hi>I
meet with many ſuch like, or the ſame paſſages, as in his</hi>
Chriſt alone exalted. <hi>vol. 1. p.</hi> 120. Christ belongs to ſinners
as ſinners. <hi>p.</hi> 211. He receiveth ſinners as ſinners. <hi>p.</hi> 164.
All the tie lies on Gods part to do every thing that is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the Covenant. <hi>p.</hi> 73. Haſt thou but a mind to Chriſt,
come and taſte of the water of life freely; there is nothing looked
for from thee to take thy portion in this Christ. <hi>And in his
ſecond Volume, p.</hi> 420 We are juſtified without works not only
without the concurrence of them to juſtification, but even without
the being of them, and preſence in the perſon to be juſtified. <hi>I
might name many more, but theſe may ſuffice; and I pray
conſider ſeriouſly whether from moſt, if not all thoſe aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
doth not follow by natural and neceſſary conſequence
that monſtrous concluſion now enquired of,</hi> viz. <hi>that wee
may be ſaved without faith and repentance. Or, that faith
and repantance are not neceſſary to ſalvation. Truly they
ſpeak ſo fully to this particular, in my apprehenſion, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:167980:4"/>
all that I can ſee left you to ſave your ſelfe is, not to own
theſe men for men of your ſide, which I ſhould be heartily
glad to heare. But conſider one paſſage more frequent,
as in theſe Authors, ſo in your owne Sermon; This,</hi> That
the Covenant of free grace is as free as that with Noah. <hi>Now
concerning that we know, that men are partakers of the
benefits promiſed in it, though they neither know nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
any ſuch Covenant. And if this of ſalvation be as
free, wil it not thence follow, that men may be ſaved in it
though they never believe it, or ſo much as know it? To me
it ſeems to follow without any conſtraint at all, as I ſhall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
to manifeſt by reducing it to an Argument, which I
forme thus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By vertue of the Covenant with <hi>Noah,</hi> men are ſure to be
ſaved from an univerſal deluge, though they neither know
nor believe ſuch a Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Therefore if the new Covenant be as free as that with
<hi>Noah,</hi> a man may be ſaved in it, though he neither know
it, nor can believe it: More of this particular you may
read in Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> againſt <hi>Saltmarſh,</hi> both in the former
Treatiſe <hi>pag.</hi> 25. and in the Rejoynder <hi>pag.</hi> 11, 13, 88. where
he clearly ſheweth this very inference to be unconſtrained,
and makes good the charge now in debate againſt Mr. <hi>Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marſh:</hi>
which Reverend Author, if you had any reference
unto in that unſavory and noiſome paſſage in your Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
<hi>I challenge malice it ſelf,</hi> I muſt needs tell you, you
were exceedingly to blame.</p>
                  <p>Come wee to your Arguments, whereby you labour to
prove, that <hi>no conditions are annexed to the purchaſes of
Chriſts death in regard of application.</hi> Your firſt was from
thoſe places of Scripture, which declare the all ſufficiency of
Chriſts death, and the perfection of that in regard of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petration,
as <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 14 and 1, 3, 9, 12 Unto which may be
added your ſecond head of Scriptures, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe which hold
out unto us Gods acceptation of this price and acquieſence
in it: as, <hi>This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:167980:4"/>
Now theſe doe prove, that the price paid by Chriſt
was perfect and ſufficient; yea, that it did fully impetrate,
merit and purchaſe at the Fathers hands, the perfect and
complete redemption of his Elect; So that God lookes for
nothing more to be done, or ſuffered towards the making
up of the price, but reſts fully ſatisfied with the ſufferings
of his Son. But they are of no force at all to take off any
requiſite neceſſary to the application of this purchaſe, be it
qualification, condition, inſtruments or agent: for inſtance,
If I ſhould on your ground argue, Jeſus Chriſt hath by
himſelfe purged our ſins, and perfected &amp;c. Therefore
there is no neede the Goſpel ſhould be preached unto men,
or that the ſpirit of grace be ſent unto them to regenerate
them; I doubt not, but you would deny my inference,
as well you might. So where you reaſon, Chriſt by dying
hath paid a perfect price, which was alſo accepted of
God the Father. <hi>Ergo,</hi> there are no conditions annexed
to the purchaſe of his death; you muſt give me leave to
deny your Argument. And the reaſon is, becauſe they
are not annexed as any part of the price, to make up it
complete: But only as the way and manner in which, the
means and inſtrument by which, the terms and condition
on which, and according to which God doth give, and
man receives ſalvation purchaſed: Notwithſtanding that,
Chriſt hath thus perfectly purchaſed it, yet himſelf doth
tell me, that unleſſe I repent, I ſhall periſh, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13. 3, 5.
And If I believe not, I ſhall be damned, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 16. As
for that maxime you cited in the proſecution of your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument,<note place="margin">Impetration is the foundation of application.</note>
                     <hi>Impetratio eſt fundamentum applicationis,</hi> it makes
for us, and not at all againſt us. For if it be <hi>fundamentum,</hi>
the foundation, then it is not <hi>ipſa applicatio,</hi> the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
it ſelf, which is the monſter your ſide doe hug and
ſuckle. It makes indeed againſt <hi>Arminian ſalvability;</hi> for
which end it is uſed by our Authours, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſhew that
though impetration and application may be diſtinguiſhed,
yet they cannot be ſeparate or divided in their object. But
that for whomſoever Chriſt doth impetrate, to him the
benefits impetrated muſt be applyed; for application (ſay
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:167980:5"/>
they) is the end of impetration, and impetration the
foundation of application. So that the <hi>Arminian</hi> doctrine
of conditions to be performed by mans owne power, which
make the iſſue of Chriſts death to be uncertaine and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
on mans free will, is wholly razed thereby: but our
doctrine of conditions purchaſed for us by the death of
Chriſt, and to be wrought in us by the Spirit of Chriſt are
no way ſhaken. The purchaſes of Chriſts death may be
ſurely applied to them for whom they are purchaſed,
though they be applyed conditionally.</p>
                  <p>Nor is that other maxime of any more ſtrength, <hi>poſitâ
cauſâ totali ſequitur effectus,</hi> the totall cauſe being put, the
effect followeth; for if you ſpeak of mans actual ſalvation,
or the application of ſalvation unto man, you cannot ſay
that Chriſts death is the total cauſe of it. The whole and
ſole meritorious cauſe it is; But I hope Gods grace is the
impulſive cauſe, Chriſts ſpirit the efficient cauſe, and faith
the inſtrumental cauſe. And, <hi>bonum eſt ex integris cauſis,</hi>
Good doth ariſe from all cauſes entire. Now though an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
be the meaneſt of cauſes, yet is it neceſſary in the
way of an inſtrument, nor can the effect be in act before
it be uſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Your third head contained ſuch Scriptures as ſpeake of
Chriſt and ſalvation, as of a gift, a free gift: In purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of which you delivered,</hi> Chriſt is given, freely given of
God. And if by grace, then not of works. And what can
be laid on the creature that is not a worke. If but a Roſe, not
free. To be freely and by condition, is an abſolute and flat
contradiction.</p>
                  <p>For anſwer, the Covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> in a paſſage be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
you aver to be conditional; And in a paſſage
following, you ſeeme to intimate, that it is free, by ſaying
that <hi>he could not have merited, had he kept the condition.</hi> It
ſeems then that to be free, and yet to be conditional, as
flat a contradiction as it is, you your ſelfe have admitted
in the Covenant with <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Did you ſeriouſly conſider what you ſpake when you
ſaid, <hi>if but to pay a roſe, the tenure is not free?</hi> Certainly
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:167980:5"/>
my Country men in <hi>Gloceſter-ſhire</hi> account that a very free
tenure, nor think I them therein miſtaken. And if ſome
Gentlemen ſhould beſtow on you an hundred pound a
year, on condition you ſhould be more liberal to the poor
to the expence, not of a roſe or two, or a penny or two,
but (it may be) ten or twenty pound a yeare, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
you conſtantly exhibite, you were to loſe the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal.
If for all this condition you ſhould not ſay that this
were a free gift, I ſhould account you fowly unthankful.
If my memory faile not, our ancient godly Divines uſe
thoſe ſimilitudes of a Roſe or pepper corne, to ſet out the
condition, not of faith, but of good works, which they
maintaine to be required under the Goſpel as a conſequent
condition. By which expreſſion of theirs, they do, (as you
ſay) deſtroy the freeneſſe of grace. But your bare ſaying
ſo doth not prove it. The truth is, the Arminians and
Papiſts were more beholding to you for ſome paſſages in
your Sermons, then our ancient godly Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.</p>
                  <p>But come wee to your Argument, which if not taken
out of Doctor <hi>Criſpe,</hi> is yet certainly the ſame with his,
<hi>vol. 1. p. 64. &amp;</hi> p. 179. <hi>By gift, and on condition, is a flat
contradiction.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But take heed that you and the Doctor make not the
Scriptures to ſpeake abſolute and flat contradiction, which
ſay,</hi> wee are ſaved by grace through faith. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. And
therefore it is of faith, that it might be by grace. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 16.
And being juſtified freely by his grace through faith in his
blood. <hi>Rom. 3. 23, 24. And in the very place cited by you
and the Doctor,</hi> Rom 11. 6. If by grace, then it is no more
of works, otherwiſe grace is no more grace. But if it be by
works, it is no more of grace, otherwiſe works are no more
works; <hi>where it followes,</hi> what then? Iſrael hath not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
what he ſeeketh for. <hi>And if you ask, wherefore?
the Apoſtle will tell you</hi> Rom. 9 32. Becauſe they ſought it
not by faith, but as it were by the works of the law. <hi>So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,</hi>
Where is boaſting then? it is excluded. By what
Law? of works? Nay, but by the law of faith. <hi>Rom</hi> 3. 27.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:167980:6"/>
And to him that worketh not but believeth, <hi>Rom. 4. 5. The
Scriptures joyn faith and free grace; yea they tell us, that
freeneſſe of grace is upheld by that requiſite or condition
of faith. But you call it a flat contradiction. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
oppoſe faith and works. But you ſay,</hi> What can be
laid upon the creature, that is not a work? <hi>You would beare
men in hand that we teach contradictions. But I am ſure
theſe paſſages of yours contradict the Scripture.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, did not Chriſt lay repentance and faith upon
the creature, when he ſaid, <hi>repent and believe the Goſpel?
Matth 4. 17. Mark</hi> 1. 15. yea, doth he not lay it on them
upon paine of damnation, when he doubles it <hi>Luke 13. 35.
except ye repent ye ſhall periſh?</hi> Did not the Apoſtles lay
ſomething on the creature, when they thus anſwered their
troubled converts, who in anguiſh of ſpirit came with
theſe queries to them, <hi>men and brethren what ſhal we doe?</hi>
Acts <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. 37. <hi>And Sirs, what ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> ch. 16. 20.
I ſay, when they thus anſwered them, <hi>repent and believe
on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and be converted;</hi> Did they not
require ſomething of them, and lay ſomething on them?
And did Chriſt or his Apoſtles (think you) preach any
thing contradictory to free grace, or free gift? I hope,
whatever contradictions you pinne on our Sermons, you
will take heed what you faſten on the ſayings of Chriſt and
his Apoſtles, whoſe doctrine we muſt take leave to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
and follow, how contradictory ſoever it be deemed
in the world. Do not ſay here, that Chriſt did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
them, nor his Diſciples preſſe them, <hi>as conditions, or
as a worke</hi> (which is the Doctors evaſion) for you your
ſelfe know that we diſclaime faith as a worke, as much as
you. Wee maintaine not any worthineſſe, excellency
or merit in faith. I deſire you to ſhew me if you can, in
any of ours, that faith doth juſtifie as a work done by us or
for any worthineſſe or excellency that is in it. I am ſure
that I can ſhew you the contrary, and you may alſo ſee it
if you be pleaſed to peruſe Mr. <hi>Gatakers rejoynder to Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marſh.
p.</hi> 51. 53. This is that we maintaine, that faith is
ſo required of God, that if we have it, we ſhall have ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:167980:6"/>
and if we have it not, we cannot have ſalvation,
and that not only in knowledge, but in the being of it:
not only the evidence, declaration, and manifeſtation of
that (which is the Doctors opinion. <hi>p.</hi> 168. and I feare is
alſo yours) but not the receipt, benefit, or being of it, and
that becauſe it is required to the very obtaining of it, not
in any meritorious, but in an inſtrumentall way.</p>
                  <p>Now do not the Apoſtles averre as much when they
anſwer this quaerie, what ſhall I do to be ſaved? thus,
<hi>repent and believe &amp;c.</hi> do they not in theſe anſwers lay
repentance and faith on the creature as things required of
God in them that would be ſaved, and that towards the
obtaining of their ſalvation, not the evidencing or mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting
it only to themſelves. And when the Apoſtle ſaith,
the Jewes came ſhort of righteouſneſſe which the Gentiles
attained unto, becauſe they ſought it not by faith as the
Gentiles did <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 31. Doth he ſpeak of the <hi>manifesto</hi> of
Righteouſneſſe, and not rather of righteouſneſſe and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
it ſelfe, the being of it? Certainly the Jewes
fel ſhort, not only of the aſſurance, but of the eſſence and
being of righteouſneſſe, and that becauſe they ſought it
not by faith. So that faith is required of God from the
creature ſo, and laid on the creature ſo, that by it the
creature muſt ſeek everlaſting righteouſneſſe, the being of
it, or he ſhall for ever goe without it.</p>
                  <p>But for the thing it ſelfe, that a gift may be free, and
yet conditional, is no ſuch contradictory propoſition, but
that both parts may be true, well ſtand together, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
rather then deſtroy each other; you might have ſeen
in our Authors, if you had beene pleaſed to look in to
them, or to have called to mind what I perſwade my ſelf you
have formerly read in them.<note n="c" place="margin">Camero in Pſ. 68. inter Arg Solut. Med. ult</note>

                     <hi>Prideaux,</hi> That to a meritorious worke,

                     <pb n="12" facs="tcp:167980:7"/>
Firſt, it muſt wholly and entirely proceede from the
undertaker. The perſon that will merit, muſt doe it of
himſelfe, out of his owne ſtrength and power: So was
the condition of works to have been performed. Man
had ſtrength conveyed to him in created nature, and was
to have kept the condition by this his ſtrength. But thus
it is not in the conditions of the Goſpel: we receive
ſtrength from grace, to performe the conditions of grace.
God who requires them of us, works them in us; he gives
to repent, he gives us to believe: which I think is the
Crowne of free grace, that gives us a crowne upon our
bare receiving it, and gives us alſo withall a hand to take
it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It muſt be a mans owne, no way due or
belonging to the perſon of whom we me merit Suppoſe
a tenant be three or foure years rent behind with his
Landlord, to the value (it may be) of one hundred pound,
or two hundred pound; and having nothing to pay, ſhould
be freely forgiven by his Landlord, only on this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that he carefully pay his rent for time to come. Shall
this perſon ſay, the gift was not free becauſe upon this
condition? Why the condition is due unto the Landlord,
whether he forgive what is paſt or no, and therefore, can
no way detract from the freeneſſe of the gift. So is our
faith due, our repentance is due (the fall, and the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
by Chriſt ſuppoſed) to God from us, whether he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give
and juſtifie upon them or no. And therefore the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the gift of righteouſneſſe is no way impaired by
the requirement of them. When we have done all wee
are commanded, we muſt ſay we are unprofitable ſervants,
<hi>Luk. 17. 10. unprofitable</hi> ſaith<note n="e" place="margin">Panſtr. Cathol. tom. 3. l. 14. c. 16. &amp; 21. ad 25.</note> 
                     <hi>Chamier to our ſelves,</hi> we
have not earned ſo much as thanks for our ſelves; and
that becauſe we have done no more then whats our duty.

                     <hi>Oppoſita ſunt ſolvere debitum et mereri: To pay</hi> or <hi>diſcharge

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It muſt be ſome way profitable or advantageous
to the perſon of whom we merit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:167980:7"/>
Now this alſo failes: for, <hi>can a man be profitable to God, as
a wiſe man is profitable to himſelfe? Is it any gaine or plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to him, that thou makeſt thy waies perfect? Job</hi> 22. 2. &amp; 35.
4, 5. What profit is it to the Sunne, that wee receive its
light into our houſes? or to the ſpring, that we drinke of
its water? God is no way indamaged by our impenitency,
nor advantaged by our returne in to him; All the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument
accrues to us our ſelves. And therefore though
he require our return unto him, and beliefe on him, if we
will be ſaved by him, yet is his gift of ſalvation
nevertheleſſe free, becauſe he is no way the gainer by the
things required Nay, the conditions required by him are
matter of further charge and expence unto him, he being
the worker and donor of them, as was ſhewed in the firſt
particular. Suppoſe that ſome rich perſon ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt
a poore mans child to be his heire, upon condition
that the child be ſent home unto him, to live with him,
and to be trained and bred up in learning by him. Shall
the young man ſay, it is not free? becauſe it is upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
he leaves his fathers cottage for it, he goes to ſchool
for it &amp;c? Alas, what profit are either of theſe to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
father? Nay, rather they are matter of further
charge to him; For by reaſon of theſe, he is at coſt for
his food, apparel, ſchooling, and other neceſſaries to his
breeding and education: So when the Lord who chuſeth
amongſt his enemies thoſe whom he adopts to be heirs
of ſalvation, doth require of them, that they repent of
their ſin, beleeve on his Sonne, leave off all their vaine
wayes, and learne to be like himſelf who is their father:
Theſe heires of grace cannot ſay that their inheritance is
not freely given, becauſe it is given on theſe termes and
conditions: for the things required are no way profitable
to God who doth require them; but rather matter of
further coſt and charge unto him, who ſends his word, his
meſſengers, his graces, his ſpirit for the working of
them.</p>
                  <p>4. It muſt be ſome way proportionable to the reward we
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:167980:8"/>
expect for it, which alſo failes in our conditions; for what
proportion is there between our repentance and remiſſion,
between our faith and juſtification. As the Apoſtle, our
<hi>light afflictions,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">12 Cor. 4. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>which are but for a moment, work forth unto
us an exceeding, and eternal weight of glory.</hi> So may we
alſo ſay of our repentance and faith. If the Landlord
ſhould ſay to his Tenant (one hundred or two hundred
pound indebted to him) Theſe ſummes you owe, and I do
not ſee where you have a penny to pay, I might uſe extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
towards you, caſt you into priſon, and there let you
rot; but I will not deale ſo ſeverely with you. Do but
make an ingenuous acknowledgment of what you owe, and
that you will be beholding to me, and I will freely remit
it. Shall this perſon ſay, he was not freely forgiven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it was on this condition, his acknowledgment?
Alas, what proportion is there betweene the debt and the
acknowledgment? Thus God ſeemes to ſpeak to us in
the matter of repentance.<note n="h" place="margin">Jer. 3. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Only acknowledg thine iniquities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſumme of all is, That a man gives freely, which he
gives on condition, when withal he gives ability to perform
the condition; elſe ſalvation given for, and through Chriſt
would not be free.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch are the conditions we pleade for, as our duties,
ſo Gods gifts and graces: and therefore the gift of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
notwithſtanding them, is free.</p>
                  <p>Againe, That we give on condition, the condition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the parties duty to whom we give, is free, elſe the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that parents give dutiful children would not be free
gift.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch are the conditions maintained by us; ſuch as
we owe of duty to God, whether he give or no; he giveth
therefore freely, though he require them.</p>
                  <p>3. That we give on conditions, the conditions being
no way beneficial to us who give, no way equivalent to the
thing we give, nor any way cauſal of our giving, we give
moſt freely.</p>
                  <p>But ſuch alſo are the conditions defended by us, as hath
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:167980:8"/>
beene made apparent, they no way benefit the Lord at
all, they are infinitely diſproportionable to the gift of
ſalvation he beſtowes, nor do they any way move him to
beſtow ſalvation; but rather his will and purpoſe to beſtow
ſalvation, moves him to beſtow them, that by receipt of
them, his people might be fitted for the ſalvation he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
them.</p>
                  <p>And therefore notwithſtanding that they are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the gift of ſalvation is moſt free.</p>
                  <p>Thus have we done with your Argument, from the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of grace (which, that it may well ſtand with our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
I hope is well cleared) as alſo with your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
taken from ſcripture. We come now to thoſe you
fetch from Reaſon The firſt of which was taken from the
intent of Chriſt in dying, which the Scriptures hold out to
be the ſalvation of thoſe for whom he died. Now (ſay
you) <hi>if he died conditionally, it will follow that he willed not
their ſalvation at all, but their damnation, as much or more
then their ſalvation; for he wills their ſalvation if they believe,
otherwiſe their damnation: and it is natural to them not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This and all that followes in the Argument, may
make againſt the Arminians, who hold that Chriſt
hath purchaſed ſalvation for us, but not faith, and that he
died for us conditionally <hi>(i. e.)</hi> that we ſhould be ſaved if we
did believe but did no way procure for us, that we ſhould
believe; and accordingly it is uſed by our Authors, though
in other terms, to deſtroy the Arminians conditionality;
as you may ſee in<note n="i" place="margin">

                     <hi>Owen.</hi> But conditional redemption, in
which the conditions are purchaſed, as wel as the ſalvation
(which is that we maintain) it no way oppugneth. Put
caſe an outlandiſh man ſhould procure for his Sonne ſome
inheritance in our Country to be enjoyed by him upon
his infranchiſement; you cannot ſay he intended his Sons
non-enjoyment of it as much as enjoyment, becauſe of the
condition of his Infranchiſement, if that the Infranchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

we maintaine that Chriſt hath procured ſalvation for us, to
be enjoyed conditionally, if wee doe believe. You cannot

hope you will not, though your parallelling the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
with that with <hi>Noah</hi> doth naturally yeild ſuch an
inference, as hath already beene ſhewed.</p>
                  <p>Your ſecond Argument was the ſame with one you uſed
in your former ſermons, where you aſſerted the abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the new Covenant, <hi>viz. That this conditionality in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
a liberty of will.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>You make men believe that we preach not repentance as the
grace of God by his Spirit, wrought in our hearts in and for
Chriſt, which is moſt untrue; and who of us denies faith to be
the gift of God, or that God out of his love to us in Chriſt, freely
worketh it in us, that therby we may be enabled to receive Chriſt.</hi>
That we are not only halfe dead, but quite dead, and can
do nothing that is good until the ſpirit quicken us; cannot
goe to Chriſt til God the Father draweth us: cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
on Chriſt nor repent of ſin until the Lord give it unto
us, and enable us thereto, is a doctrine I have long agoe
learned from their Sermons, and often meete with in their
writings. And as for the inference, he which chargeth
the Patronage of free will on that kind of preaching, that
holds out life and ſalvation upon condition of faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:167980:9"/>
let him looke to it how he will quit Chriſt and
his Apoſtles from that charge, whoſe Sermons are full of
counſels, commands and calls, that require men to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent
and believe, if ever they would be ſaved. Sir, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to be performed by us of our owne ſtrength and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
which the Arminians maintaine, argue a power in mans
will indeede. But conditions purchaſed by Chriſt for us,
and to be wrought by his Spirit in us, which we maintain;
Inferre no power of free wil at all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Your third Argument was taken from election.</hi> That
from this conditional redemption would follow, that men are
elected but conditionally, ſo that Gods election ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined
and uneffectual, and the will of God ſhould be made
ſubordinate to the will of the creature.</p>
                  <p>Sir, God may be ſaid to elect conditionally two
wayes.</p>
                  <p>1. So as that the condition be conſidered as anteceding
his election, moving him to will ſalvation to ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
This conditionality indeed ſubordinates the will of
the Creator to the creature, and cauſeth election to be
undetermined and ineffectual. But ſuch kind of conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
we oppugne as Arminian.</p>
                  <p>Or 2. ſo, as that the condition preceede indeed the
actual enjoyment of the benefits to which men are elected,
but followes election it ſelf. And this conſideration of
conditions of election we propugne, as no way evacuating
either the efficacy or determinateneſſe of Gods election,
nor yet in any wiſe ſubjecting the wil of God to the will of
man therein. Hear what Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> ſaith to this very thing.

religiouſly maintained.</hi> No Sir, our doctrine concerning
conditions, doth no way deſtroy the certainty of election.
But on the contrary, the doctrine of election doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme
this our Tenent of Conditional Redemption. For
ſo as God from all eternity purpoſed ſalvation unto us, and
elected us thereto: So did Chriſt purchaſe it, and ſo is it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:167980:10"/>
actually to be applied. But God<note n="n" place="margin">2 Theſ. 2. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>hath from the beginning
choſen us to ſalvation through ſanctification of the ſpirit, and
beliefe of the truth.</hi> And heretofore Chriſt did purchaſe it
to be obtained that way, and that way it is actually to be
enjoyed. So that till we be brought over, to the beliefe
of the truth and ſome degree of Sanctification; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be ſaid actually to partake of any part of the ſalvation
purpoſed or purchaſed. That God elects for faith fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeene,
we uterly deny; but that he electeth through or
by it, <hi>i.e.</hi> ſalvation to be obtained through or by it, we religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
maintain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Your fourth Argument runnes thus,</hi> If the purchaſes of
Chriſts death have any condition annexed to them in regard of
application, then theſe conditions ſhare with Chriſt in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of ſalvation. <hi>It is the ſame with another of your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
uſed in your former lectures, and neere of kinne
to that of Doctor</hi> Criſpe, vol. 1. p. 168. Then Chriſt juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
not alone. Is faith Chriſt himſelfe? if not, then Chriſt
muſt have a partner to juſtifie.</p>
                  <p>But the ſequel both in yours and the Doctors Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is notoriouſly falſe; and that becauſe conditions are
not required in the ſame way of cauſality that Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs
is. For that is required as a meritorious cauſe, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing
and procuring mans peace; faith is an inſtrument
apprehending it, and Chriſt the cauſe of it; repentance as a
way leading to it, or qualification fitting a perſon for it.
Now when an effect depends on divers cauſes of a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
kind, the neceſſity of the one, argues not the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency
of the other; but the one may be ſufficient in
its kind, though the other be required. The wounded
perſon muſt apply the plaiſter to the wound, if he wil have
it heale him. The diſeaſed perſon muſt drink the potion,
muſt travel to the bath, and bathe himſelfe therein, if he
will have either the potion to purge him, or the bath
to cure him: Yet would it be great weakneſſe in either
of theſe, to ſay, that the plaiſter, the potion, the bath
were not ſufficient, becauſe they were required to goe
unto the one, to take and apply the other; for their taking,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:167980:10"/>
going, drinking, applying, are not required in the ſame
ſanatory and medicinal way as the bath, the plaiſter, or
the portion are; but only in an inſtrumental way, to
bring theſe home to him, that ſo they might worke upon
him. So, nor is my repentance and faith required in any
ſatisfactory or meritorious way, to ſatisfie Gods juſtice to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with Chriſt, or merit remiſſion for me; no, Chriſt
doth that alone, they are only required to fit me for Chriſt,
and bring me to Chriſt. Did we aſcribe any merit or
worthineſſe to our conditions, then you might ſay indeed
that we made them partners with Chriſt; but we abhorre
this as much as you. <hi>Faith,</hi> ſaith Mr.<note n="o" place="margin">Rejoynder p. 47.</note>

wherewith our debt is to be diſcharged.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That this anſwer would be made unto your Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
you your ſelfe foreſaw; and therefore to Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate
it. You ſay, — <hi>But ſome diſtinguiſh betweene

you reply, That this is a moſt weake evaſion, for Papiſts

for; and cite for it <hi>Conc. Trid. Seſs. 6. c.</hi> 8.</p>
                  <p>And here Sir, is a ſecond calumnie. For as before
you ranked us with Arminians, ſo here you would inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
that we joyne hands with Papiſts in maintaining of this
conditional redemption. But as I hope I have vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
it from the charge of Arminianiſme; ſo I doubt not
alſo to cleare it from this of Papiſme.</p>
                  <p>Is it enough, my good friend, to make a thing evil, to
ſay that Papiſts hold ſo? Why did you cite <hi>Aeſtius</hi> and
<hi>Leſſius,</hi> both Papiſts, among the Champions of your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?
Papiſts agree with us, and wee with them in many
things. Nor call we that Popiſh where they are ſound, and
agree with us, but that only wherein they being erroneous
we diſſent from them, and proteſt againſt them. Now whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
or no Papiſts maintaine any meritoriouſneſſe in the
preparations they defend, ſure I am, that Proteſtant
Authors chiefly oppoſe this meritoriouſneſſe of them, as I
ſhall prove unto you.</p>

                  <p>Out of which of <hi>Chemnitius,</hi> I obſerve three things.
(1) That however in that Seſſion they did daube over
the matter, yet they did hold a dignity, worth, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of congruity to be in theſe preparations, which
the ſame <hi>Chemnitius</hi> doth afterwards prove at large,
ſpending three or foure leaves therein. (2) That <hi>Chem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitius</hi>
held ſomething, ſome worke wrought by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
in man to precede his juſtification, or his reception
of juſtification; for in the following paragraph, thus he
ſpeaks.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="q" place="margin">Falſum eſt i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitur quod in 9 canone no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis tribuunt, quaſi docemus nullum pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne motum voluntatis divinitus donatum et excitatum, praeced ere acceptionem juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficationis: Omnino enim docemus poenitentiam et contritionem praecedere.

ninth Canon they attribute to us, as
if we taught that not any motion of

doe goe before. Wee doe not ſay, that
they goe before as a merit, which
by
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:167980:11"/>
its worth doth cooperate to the obtaining of juſtification; but
as the ſenſe of ſickneſſe or griefe of a wound, is not any merit
of the cure, but doth raiſe and ſtirre up to deſire,
ſeeke out and welcome the Phyſician. For the whole hath no
neede of the Phſitian, but they that are ſick, as Chriſt ſaith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And in this ſenſe,</hi> thoſe things (as the Scripture ſaith) do
go before.</p>
                  <p>3. That he could eaſily have agreed with thoſe
<hi>Tridentine</hi> Fathers about preparations (the word prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
being rightly underſtood, and according to Scripture
expreſſions;) if they would not have aſcribed them to the
ſtrength of free wil, nor have put the worth and merit of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification
upon them. By this (I think) it is plaine, that they
were meritorious preparations that <hi>Chemnitius</hi> did oppoſe
in his writings againſt the Papiſts. And truly I wonder,
that you ſhould cavil at that diſtinction I gave between
a condition and a meritorious cauſe: And more, that,
you ſhould ſay that Papiſts aſcribe no merit to conditions,
and preparations. You know the queſtion <hi>concerning
the conditional promiſes of the Goſpel</hi> is handled under that
<hi>concerning the neceſſity of works,</hi> where our Writers grant <hi>a
neceſſity of preſence, but not of efficiencie,</hi> which <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
contends for. Now I pray, what doe they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand

what other then that can be aſcribed unto works? yea, that
our Authours underſtand merit by that efficiency, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.

is more ſhewed in the latter then in the firſt Covenant.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
in it no conditions at all.</p>
                  <p>Sir, The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>To him that worketh the reward

                     <hi>not of grace, but of debt,</hi> Rom. 4. 4. I know ſome
hold the Covenant with <hi>Adam,</hi> wherein works were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
to be a Covenant of Grace. I have heard Mr.
<hi>Symonds</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> deliver that in a Sermon at <hi>Rederith,</hi>
and thereupon divide the Covenant of Grace into the
Covenant of Works, and the Covenant of Faith. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
had <hi>Adam</hi> kept the condition of the firſt Covenant,
he had done no more then his Duty; nor had he profited
God at all; beſides, there would have been ſmall or no
proportion between that his Work and the reward; all
which are required to merit proper. So that in ſome
ſenſe that may be called a Covenant of Grace. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe
in the latter Covenant of Faith, the grace of God
is ſo far more fully, richly, and gloriouſly manifeſted,
then in that of Works, as that it obtaineth the title of
the Covenant of Grace. The Apoſtle ſaith, it <hi>was by
Faith, that it might be by Grace,</hi> Rom. 4. 16. And the
Scripture being ſo plain for it, I ought to believe it, though
I could not make it out to others, wherein it was freer,
nor yet apprehend it my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But my good friend, the buſineſſe is not ſo difficult
but that it may be, and hath been already diſpatch'd by
ſome of our ſide, and the freeneſſe of the latter above
the former, notwithſtanding the conditionality of both, at
large diſcovered. And that not by excluding faith, or
the condition of faith from the latter (as you would have
it) for that would interfere with that of the Apoſtle now
cited, <hi>By Faith, that it might be of Grace;</hi> where Faith is
taken in, not left out to make out the freeneſſe. Nor
yet only becauſe faith is given of God, and ſo ability to
keep the latter Covenant is given, which is ſomething. For
though that ſtrength <hi>Adam</hi> had to keep the firſt Covenant
was freely beſtowed on him by God in his Creation, yet
when God was pleaſed to enter into a Covenant with
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:167980:14"/>
him, he had it in him, and was to work in his own ſtrength
and power. Whereas in the New Covenant God finds
man in an impotent, weak, and dead condition, and
graciouſly promiſeth to work in him ability to do what
he requireth: This (I ſay) is ſomething that ſerves to
ſhew the freeneſſe of Divine Grace in the new Covenant;
for the Apoſtle ſaith expreſly, <hi>Epheſ. 2. 8. We are ſaved by
Grace through faith, and that not of our ſelves, it is the gift
of God;</hi> where the giving of the thing required, to wit,
Faith, is introduced by the Apoſtle to ſhew the freeneſs of
Grace.</p>
                  <p>But the ſuperabundancy of Grace in the latter Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
appears moſtly in this, that in the former, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of mans Juſtification had been ſomething of his own,
his own exact and perfect obedience to the Law of God;
but in the latter, the matter of it is an others, the perfect
Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. In the one, man runs into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
for the price of his life and happineſs: But in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
faith carries him out of himſelf unto another, the
Lord Jeſus Chriſt for all. In the one, the condition it ſelf
and the keeping of it, was to have been the matter of
mans Righteouſneſs, the ground of his Juſtification. In
the other, it is only the Inſtrument and Mean. In the one,
the condition it ſelf <hi>(Works)</hi> procured life, in and of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
without any reference to any other; but in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<hi>Faith</hi> is looked on, not as a <hi>Work,</hi> but as an <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
nor doth it ſave for any excellency, worth, or
vertue that is in it; but only becauſe it layes hold on
Chriſt. I cannot better expreſſe my ſelf then in Mr. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers</hi>
words, <hi>Rejoynder. p. 46, 47. In the one, Works are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered,
as in themſelves performed by the Parties to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified
and live. In the other, Faith is conſidered and requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
not as a work barely done by us, but us an Inſtrument
whereby Chriſt is apprehended, in whom is found, and by
whom that is done, whereby Gods Juſtice is ſatisfied, and life
eternal meritoriouſly procured for us; ſo that they differ as
much as theſe two Propoſitions. 1. Pay your debt of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
pounds and be free. 2. Rely on ſuch a friends ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:167980:15"/>
made for it, and be as free as if you had made full pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and ſatisfaction your ſelf.</hi> All this and more you
may find in that reverend Divine, your contempt of
whom, and all other not of your way, ſads the hearts of
your friends, and makes them fear that which they are
loath to ſuſpect concerning you.</p>
                  <p>You proceed, and tell us that though it be not merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,<note place="margin">Conditio Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedens eſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiva.</note>
yet if it be Antecedent, it muſt be Effective; For <hi>an
Antecedent condition is effective.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sir, By your own maintaining faith to be an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in the work of our ſalvation (which I think is more
then a condition, though no more I believe then truth)
you muſt of neceſſity grant it both a precedency and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
therein; for inſtruments are alwayes reckoned to
the efficient cauſe, and in order of nature precede the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
And thus I conceive that faith is effective in the
work of our ſalvation, as an inſtrument receiving Chriſt,
not as a condition. Conditions are not effective, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
are. As for that of<note n="z" place="margin">Tom. 3. l. 5. c. 5. §. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Chamier,</hi> that <hi>a conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Antecedent is effective;</hi> I conceive he means meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious,
the paſſage cited out of him already leading me
to that conjecture: <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">ibid. §. 16</note> 
                     <hi>Condition of faith
is not Antecedent, but conſequent, becauſe no merit of faith
is conſidered, or faith is not the Cauſe of Salvation.</hi> Now that
Conditions are meritorious, yea or ſo much as impulſive,
is altogether denied by the Aſſertors of conditions, who
allow no cauſality at all to them. It reſts on you to prove
that the Antecedency of a condition doth infer its cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity:
For though <hi>Chamier</hi> aver it, yet I ſee no ground
for that his aſſertion, eſpecially in ſuch conditions, as thoſe
we maintain in the New Covenant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Your firſt Argument runs thus:</hi> If Conditions be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then no man can be ſure of the benefits purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
whiles he lives; for the conditions muſt be performed, <hi>&amp;c.
To which we may add two Arguments of your former Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
the firſt the very ſame with this:</hi> If ſalvation were
on condition, then none could be ſure of ſalvation, for none
can be ſure to hold out in performance of the Condition. <hi>The
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:167980:15"/>
other,</hi> If any condition be required, then none can be ſaved,
for none can perform the condition. <hi>Adam</hi> could not abſtain
from one tree when he was in the ſtate of Innocency. Much
leſſe.—</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Sir, your inſtance of <hi>Adam,</hi> we conceive it
unſound. That he did not abſtain, we finde by woful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience;
but that he could not, we deny. <hi>Recepit poſſe
ſi vellet, non autem velle ut poſſet,</hi> ſaith a Father. <hi>Adam</hi>
had power to have abſtained if he would, only his will was
not confirmed in good; whereupon it came to paſſe that
he freely fell.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Your weapon may be turned againſt your
ſelf: For whereas you hold, That none are ſaved but
ſuch as believe, it may be objected unto you out of your
own Argument, Then none can be ſaved, for none can
believe; or, Then none can be ſure of Salvation,
becauſe none can bee ſure to hold out in belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It ſeemes to me directly to croſſe the
Apoſtle, who tells us, <hi>That it was of faith, that
the Promiſe might be ſure to all the Seed,</hi> Rom.
4. 16.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Whereas you ſay, <hi>That if Conditions be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
then none can be ſure, becauſe none can bee ſure to
hold out;</hi> Do you not ſeem to intimate that ſalvation is
ſure to the Elect, whether they hold out in the faith or
not? which is the Monſter Arminians would father upon
our Tenents.</p>
                  <p>For anſwer therefore to your Argument, the main of
it may wound an <hi>Arminian,</hi> who holds falling from grace:
but as for thoſe who hold no ſuch uncomfortable Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
it no way toucheth them. We ſay with <hi>David,</hi>
2 Sam. 23. 5. <hi>Although my houſe be not ſo with God, yet he
hath made with me an everlaſting Covenant ordered in all
things and ſure.</hi> For he hath promiſed to circumciſe our
hearts, to write his Lawes in our hearts, to give us a new
heart, and then through grace, after our recovery, we
may do that which in our ſick, dead, and corrupt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:167980:16"/>
eſtate we could not do; namely, keep the condition in
an Evangelical way, wherein though exact perfectneſſe
be required, yet is repentance admitted, and ſincerity
accepted.</p>
                  <p>Again, he hath promiſed to <hi>put his fear in our hearts,
that we may not depart from him,</hi> Jer. 32. 40. And we
are <hi>confident that he who hath begun a good work in us, will
perform it to the day of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 1. 6. <hi>Qui operatur ut
accedamus, idem operatur ne diſcedamus.</hi> We anſwer there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the main of your Argument, even as wee anſwer the
<hi>Arminians,</hi> That though in regard of our own ſtrength,
which is weak, we may fear, yet in regard of Gods ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutenency
we are ſure. Who will keep us, not without,
but by and through the Means he hath appointed us,
even faith; by which, as he brings us into a ſtate of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
ſo through the ſame he will keep us by his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
power unto ſalvation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. We are as
ſure of perſeverance in obſervation of the condition as of
Salvation; holding both of God by like tenure of free
promiſe.</p>
                  <p>Salvation, you ſee then, may be obteined, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the conditions required, becauſe God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to give ability to perform them, and to perſevere
in the performance of them. This you foreſaw would
be replied, and therefore anticipate it by ſaying, <hi>But God
hath promiſed to give faith.</hi> To which you rejoyne, <hi>I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
Whether that Promiſe be abſolute or conditional?</hi>
And anon, <hi>There is no reaſon why one Promiſe ſhould be
more abſolute then another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But 1. Sir, Whether abſolute or conditional, a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
it is, and ſuch as doth aſſure the ſoul of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on which ſalvation is given. So that Salvation is
ſure, notwithſtanding the conditionality of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and the ſinewes of your Argument are cut in
two.</p>
                  <p>2. For your Quaerie, <hi>Whether it be conditional or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute?</hi>
I conceive it abſolute. <hi>Chriſt procured Salvation
for us to be beſtowed conditionally, if we do believe; but faith
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:167980:16"/>
it ſelf hath he abſolutely procured without preſcribing of any
condition;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Quum promiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones de perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantia obſolutas eſſe negant, ſed conditionatas tantum, <hi>&amp;c. Ameſ. Cor. p.</hi> 389.</note> 
                     <hi>ſo that it is equivalent to an abſolute purchaſe in
reſpect of the event and iſſue. Owen</hi> Univerſal Redemp.
<hi>l. 3. c. 1. &amp;</hi> 2. For my part, I cannot imagine how any
condition (I mean Antecedent condition, for a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
condition they may admit of) can be annexed to
thoſe Promiſes, <hi>I will write my Lawes in their hearts, and
I will put my fear into their hearts, and I will take the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
heart out of their bodies.</hi> &amp;c. unleſſe free wil be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
And therefore I conceive thoſe promiſes to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
in regard of Antecedent conditions. Now where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
you ſay, <hi>There is no reaſon why one Promiſe ſhould be more
abſolute then another;</hi> the will of the Covenant Maker to
have it ſo, is it ſelf a ſufficient Reaſon. Is it not the will of
God to give Chriſt abſolutely, &amp; then ſalvation for Chriſts
ſake to them that do believe in him? Shall I ſay here,
That there is no reaſon why one gift ſhould be more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
then another? He who worketh all things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the counſel of his own will, hath infinite reaſon
both for his will and working. In the mean while, Sir,
your Reaſon from the certainty of Salvation, is (I think)
ſufficiently diſcovered to have nothing of force againſt
Proteſtant conditional Redemption.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Your laſt Argument was taken from the Analogy or
Reſemblance betwixt Chriſt and</hi> Adam; As by the one,
ſin is conveyed; ſo by the other Righteouſneſſe: but
by the one ſin and death are conveyed without Condition;
<hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I doubt not Sir, but that you will remember the old
rules; <hi>viz.</hi> 1. That ſimilitudes run not on all four. 2. Nor
are Argumentative. I might as well argue hence, That
all mankind are redeemed by Chriſt, becauſe they were
all deſtroyed by <hi>Adam:</hi> Or that all were not corrupted
by <hi>Adam,</hi> as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> on the place tels me, <hi>Ambroſe</hi>
and <hi>Origen</hi> did hence hold, becauſe all are not repaired by
Chriſt: Or with <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> That <hi>Adam</hi> conveyed inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
ſin to his poſterity whereby they periſh, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt conveyed for our reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:167980:17"/>
muſt be inherent. We ſhould many wayes clip the
truth of God, if we ſhould every way make theſe lines
run parallel. Hear <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> to the very point, <hi>This
Analogy holds true only in the general:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

particular, and the kinds, there is great difference.</hi> Adam
<hi>conveyes ſin by Propagation to his Poſterity: But Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed

                  </p>
                  <p>After this you had a paſſage concerning actual Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
and actual Reconciliation, to this purpoſe:
<hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſe men will grant that Chriſt purchaſed a ſalvability,
the ſalvation purchaſed muſt be actual; for</hi> Inter actum &amp;
potentiam non datur medium.</p>
                  <p>Sir, I know none of ours that deny, that Chriſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
actual ſalvation for thoſe for whom he dyed; <hi>i.e.</hi>
That in time they ſhould be actually ſaved in that way
and method agreed on between the Father and the Son.
The thing we deny is, That the ſalvation purchaſed, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
theirs for whom its purchaſed before they come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
to believe. You muſt give us leave to diſtinguiſh
between the Purchaſe and the Poſſeſſion: the Grant or
Donation of a Benefit, and the actual exhibition and
reception of it. The child may have an Inheritance pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed
for him, and bequeathed to him before he is born,
but he muſt be born before he can enjoy it. <hi>Abraham</hi>
had the grant and Donation of <hi>Canaan,</hi> long before his
had the actual poſſeſſion of it. Hear we Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> in
this particular;<note n="c" place="margin">Donatam igi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur &amp; gratiam &amp; ſalutem om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes &amp; ſinguli habent; quam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis rei donatae poſſeſſionem non habent ante fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem. <hi>Cor. p.</hi> 126, 127.</note> 
                     <hi>All and each have grace and ſalvation given,
though they have not the poſſeſſion of the thing given before
faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now unto theſe Arguments let us add one or two
more out of your former Sermons about the abſoluteneſs
of the Covenant; many of which having fallen in with
thoſe already diſcuſſed, and not above one or two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The firſt,</hi> If any thing were required on our part, then
beaſting could not be excluded. <hi>This alſo Dr.</hi> Criſp vol.
10. p. 71. If any thing were done on our parts to partake of
Chriſt, we might have wherein to boaſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 2.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:167980:17"/>
But I pray conſider ſeriouſly how croſſe this your Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
is to the very Text: For did not <hi>Abraham,</hi> the party
ſpoken of there, do ſomething for his part to partake of
Chriſt, when he believed? yet was he excluded from
boaſting. And doth not the Law of Fath, the Goſpel,
require faith on mans part, that Righteouſneſſe may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted?
why elſe is it called a Law? Yet the Apoſtle
ſaith expreſly, that by this Law boaſting is excluded,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27. If indeed we could do any thing in a merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
way, we might boaſt, not otherwiſe. The begger
I hope, hath little to boaſt of, and yet doth he both
crave and receive his Almes. The ſinner hath leſſe: for
as that he doth can no way merit, no more then the
beggers craving and receiving; ſo nor can he do that,
untill the Lord inable him. God muſt give him both a
mouth and a hand, before he can ſpeak for Chriſt to take
him. Yet both he muſt have, before he can receive, the
Lord having ſet down to himſelf (as you your ſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg)
ſuch a method and way of giving.</p>
                  <p>The other which ſeems to be of more ſtrength, and I
think the ſtrongeſt you bring, is this, <hi>If the Promiſe of
Salvation were upon condition of believing, then men ſhould
believe before they be juſtified, contrary to</hi> Rom. 4. 5. <hi>where
it is ſaid, God juſtifies the ungodly. Now no where in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
Believers are called ungodly;</hi> The ſame almoſt <hi>totidem
verbis</hi> you may read in the Doctor, <hi>vol. 1. p.</hi> 170, 171.</p>
                  <p>Now for anſwer unto ths, I deſire you to conſider,
what the Papiſts ſay concerning this Juſtification of the
wicked. That whereſoever in Scripture God is ſaid to
juſtifie the ungodly, it muſt be underſtood that he alſo
makes the ungodly juſt and righteous; for otherwiſe the
judgment of God would not be according to truth, and
the Lord ſhould do that himſelf which he forbids his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to do, and abhors in his creature when ever he
doth it, <hi>Exod. 23. 7. Iſaiah 5. 23. Deuter. 25. 1. Prov.</hi>
17. 15. And leſt you ſhould think light of it,<note place="margin">Fas eſt ab hoſto doceri.</note> becauſe it
comes from them, though it is right to learn even from
an enemy; hear what the learned <hi>Pemble</hi> ſaith of this
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:167980:18"/>
very rule cited by him.<note place="margin">§ 1. c. 3. of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtific.</note> 
                     <hi>We embrace this rule</hi> (ſaith he)
<hi>and the reaſon of it, acknowledging that where ever there is
Juſtification, there muſt be Juſtice ſome way or other in the
party Juſtified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> The God of truth ſhould otherwiſe call
darkneſſe light, and evil good. And therefore both
that Author, as alſo <hi>Paraeus</hi> and <hi>Chamier,</hi> tells us, that the
Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed to this ungodly perſon
is the ground of this gracious ſentence of God, whereby
he doth abſolve, acquit, and juſtifie him. So that the
perſon, though he be ungodly and unrighteous in himſelf,
and ſo unjuſtifiable, yet is he godly, juſt, and righteous
in Chriſt and through the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to him juſtifiable. Let this then be agreed on; <hi>i.e.</hi>
1. That the ground of this gracious ſentence of God,
whereby he juſtifies the ungodly muſt be ſome kind of
Righteouſneſſe. And 2. That it is the righteouſneſſe of
Chriſt imputed to the ſinner. The Quaerie then will be,
Whether this Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt be imputed to the
ſinner before he doth believe, or not till he believeth? Now
I think the Scriptures are very clear for the latter, that
Righteouſneſſe is not imputed to the ſinner til he doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve:
that very Text it ſelf confirmes it, <hi>To him that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
on him that juſtifies the ungodly, his faith is counted
for Righteouſneſſe.</hi> It is to him that believeth that Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
is imputed; and again, <hi>His faith is counted,</hi> &amp;c.
Take faith how you will, it muſt come into the imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the imputation is not without it. So again, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham
believed God and it was accounted to him for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,</hi>
ver. 3. When was it ſo accounted? Certainly
when he believed: It was whileſt he was in uncircumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
indeed, but not whileſt he was in unbelief: <hi>He received
Circumciſion</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>the Seal of the Righteouſneſs
of faith, which yet he had being uncircumciſed.</hi> As he had
Righteouſneſſe then, ſo had he faith too, for it was a
Righteouſneſſe of faith. And as it was imputed unto
him upon believing, ſo ſhall it be imputed unto us if we
believe on him who raiſed up <hi>Jeſus, verſ.</hi> 24. Hence it is
called the <hi>Righteouſneſs of faith,</hi> for that it comes to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:167980:18"/>
be ours through faith. Faith takes it, receives it, puts it
on. <hi>The Righteouſneſſe of God by Faith,</hi> Phil. 3. 9.</p>
                  <p>We anſwer then that place in the <hi>Romans</hi> thus,</p>
                  <p>1. An ungodly perſon may be taken either for one
who is wicked,<note place="margin">We grant that God doth ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly perſon but in <hi>ſenſu di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo,</hi> not in <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſu compoſito;</hi> ſo as he makes the lame to leap, the blind to ſee <hi>Iſai. 33. 6. Mat.</hi> 11. 5. By or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Nature he is firſt a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, and then is juſtified. <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford Survey of Antin. p.</hi> 110</note> and goes impenitently on in his wickedneſs,
never once looking after Chriſt; a ſinner continuing in
his impenitency and unbelief. Now ſuch an ungodly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
God doth not juſtifie; for it is againſt both his truth
and juſtice.</p>
                  <p>2. It may be taken for one that is ungodly and unju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifiable
in himſelf; but yet believing on Chriſt, is through
him and his ſatisfaction Juſt, and ſo juſtifiable. Such
an ungodly perſon God doth Juſtifie; and thus <hi>Ames,
Paraeus,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Downam,</hi> and thoſe other Divines I
have in their deſcriptions of Juſtification, make not a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſimply, but a believing ſinner to be the ſubject of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtification,
or the perſon to be juſtified.</p>
                  <p>Now whereas you ſay, <hi>That no where in Scripture a
Believer is called ungodly.</hi> I conceive it falſe, He is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
ſo there: For who is the ungodly perſon ſpoken of
there, but <hi>Abraham?</hi> and he was juſtified (as hath been
ſhewed) when he did believe. Beſides, God the object
of faith Juſtifying, who is deſcribed there to be the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fier
of the ungodly is ſaid in <hi>ver.</hi> 26. of the foregoing
Chapter, to be the Juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus.
I beſeech you tell me, doth not the Apoſtle ſpeak of one
and the ſame Juſtification in both places? Doth he not
in both places deſcribe one and the ſame perſon, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
that is juſtified? Him then whom he calls a Believer
on Chriſt in one place, the ſame he calls an ungodly perſon
in the other; and whom he cals an ungodly perſon in this,
in that he ſtiles the ſame a believing perſon. Certainly,
ſeeing (as it is <hi>Chap. 3. verſ. 30)</hi> that <hi>it is one God that ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifies
both the Circumciſion by faith, and the uncircumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
through faith, i.e.</hi> All that are juſtified, both Jew and
Gentile, circumciſed or uncircumciſed, by or through
one and the ſame mean of faith. It muſt needs be that the
ungodly perſon ſpoken of in the next Chapter, is ſuch an
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:167980:19"/>
ungodly perſon, as hath faith, and doth believe; or elſe
God ſhould juſtifie ſome without faith, to which the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
place doth aver the contrary. That place in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi>
then concerning Gods juſtifying the ungodly, will
not bear the Poſition you ground upon it; <hi>viz.</hi> That
ſinners are juſtified before they do believe; or that we
do not believe, that we may be juſtified, as the Doctor
expreſſeth it, an aſſertion as rotten as the foundation on
which it is built; and expreſly contrary to the Apoſtle,
who tells us, <hi>Galat.</hi> 2. 16. that hee had <hi>believed on
Chriſt, that ſo he might be juſtified by the Faith of
Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus have I given you an account of ſome, and thoſe
of the main of your Arguments, both wherein they have
not ſatisfied me concerning the Tenent you endeavoured
to maintain, and wherein alſo they have offended me,
whilſt they wounded that I hold for truth through the
ſides of Popery and Arminianiſm. I ſhall now ſhew you
ſome grounds of my belief on the contrary: firſt taking
leave in a word to ſtate the Queſtion, and to ſet downe
how, and what I hold concerning it</p>
                  <p>Firſt then, I diſtinguiſh between both a condition and
a meritorious cauſe, as alſo between it and an impulſive
cauſe. By condition, I underſtand neither any thing
meriting Juſtification at Gods hands in the leaſt degree,
nor yet any thing moving the Lord to Juſtifie or beſtow
Salvation on us.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, By Conditions I underſtand the reſtipulation
or repromiſſion in a Covenant, the termes and Articles
of Agreement in a Covenant betweene equals, and the
thing commanded or required in a Covenant betweene
Superiors and Inferiors, ſuch as is the Covenant between
God and man.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Whereas there are conditions, yet I aſſert
them not in any rigid and legal, but in an Evangelical
way. Not ſo, as if they were not ſtrictly and in a rigid
exactneſſe perfectly kept, there were no hope of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but ſo, as if that they be not in ſome meaſure ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:167980:19"/>
obſerved, there is ſure damnation. Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> will
tell you, that<note n="c" place="margin">New Cov. p. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>whereas in the Covenant of Nature, perfect o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
is exacted, ſo that if there be the leaſt failing in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
jot or tittle, and that but once, a man can never be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thereby, nor can the breach be made up by any repentance.
In the Covenant of Grace, perfect obedience is indeed required,
yet ſo as Repentance is admitted, and ſincerity accepted.</hi>
Conditions in this Evangelical way I plead for, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
That God in the New Covenant doth not promiſe
life and ſalvation abſolutely unto his choſen, whether
they believe and repent or no: but doth require from, and
command them to repent and believe, if they will be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the benefits purchaſed by his Son, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
by himſelf in that his Covenant: which that they may
do, he himſelf of his own grace, and for his own Sons
ſake beſtowes faith and repentance on them. Nor have
they a right to any actual enjoyment of theſe benefits un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
they do actually repent and believe.</p>
                  <p>The Grounds of my perſwaſion in this particular
follow.</p>
                  <p>1. That Covenant, wherein is a mutual ſtipulation,
is conditional. But ſuch is the new Covenant; therefore
that is conditional. As on Gods part life and ſalvation
are promiſed, ſo on mans repentance, and faith, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance
therein are required, and to be promiſed. <hi>Mar
1. 15. Chap. 6. 12. Acts 2 38. chap. 3. 19. chap. 20. 21.
John 6. 28, 29. chap. 3. 15, 16. John 8. 24. Rom. 10 6, 7, 8, 9
John 8. 31. Chap. 15 5, 6, 7, 10. Heb. 3. 6. Chap.</hi> 10, 38.
He cannot ſee wood for trees, that doth not take notice of
theſe Evangelical commands, wherein performance of
Goſpel conditions, and perſeverance in that performance
are required, they every where ſo abundantly occur.
Chooſe we out one of the places named, and a little inſiſt
on it; that <hi>Rom.</hi> 10 9. the rather for that in your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
to Mr. <hi>S.</hi> you make ſome reply thereto. <hi>How</hi> (ſay
you) <hi>do you prove, that</hi> Rom. 10 9. <hi>is ſet down the forme
and tenure of the New Covenant? I deny it; The Apoſtles
intent is. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:167980:20"/>
Sir, It is clear, as <hi>Calvin</hi> notes, that the Apoſtle here
oppoſeth the Righteouſneſſe of faith to the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Works. It is alſo clear, that in deſcribing the
Righteouſneſſe of Works he ſetteth downe the very tenor
and form of that Covenant, <hi>The man that doth them ſhall
live by them,</hi> ver. 5. And in oppoſition thereunto, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers
this to be the ſpeech of the Righteouſneſſe of
Faith, <hi>If thou confeſſeſt with thy mouth, and believeſt with
thine heart, &amp;c.</hi> If then it be granted, which cannot be
denyed, that in theſe words, <hi>The man that doth them ſhal
live by them,</hi> the tenor of the Covenant of Works is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained;
it muſt needs follow by the rule of oppoſition,
that in theſe words, <hi>If thou confeſſeſt and believeſt,</hi> &amp;c.
the tenor of the Covenant of Grace is alſo contained. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The Word is nigh thee, &amp;c.
That is the Word of faith which we preach, That if thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,</hi>
&amp;c. What (I pray you) doth he mean by the Word
of Faith, but the Goſpel? or what elſe did the Apoſtle
preach but the Goſpel? The ſum of which he ſaith to be
this, <hi>If thou confeſſe, if thou believe.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Sir, That Word or Goſpel which the Apoſtle prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
wherein he held out the Righteouſneſſe of faith,
and which he ſet in oppoſition againſt the Covenant of
Works; That ſame muſt needs be the Covenant of Grace.
But ſuch is the word here; the tenor whereof he ſaith is,
<hi>If thou confeſſe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Ergo,</hi> It is the Covenant of Grace.
And whereas you ſay, That <hi>the Apoſtles intent there is to
ſhew Gods order and method in fulfilling the promiſes of the
Covenant, and to deſcribe thoſe whom he will bring to Glory:</hi>
though it make nothing againſt us; for if that were his
intent, he might have his intent, and deſcribe both the
one and the other, in ſetting down the Covenant. (The
conditions which lead to annexed promiſes, holding out
Gods method unto us, and the counterpane of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
or Conditions engraven on the heart, being the
beſt character of a perſon to be glorified.) Though (I
ſay) this makes nothing againſt us; yet if you conſider
the ſenſe of the Apoſtles diſcourſe, both in the latter end
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:167980:20"/>
of the the foregoing Chapter, and in this; or if you pleaſe
to conſult with <hi>Junius</hi> Parallels, where he hath a<note n="f" place="margin">Lib. 2. Par. 16.</note> whole
Parallel about this place; you ſhal find that the Apoſtles
intent and ſcope is otherwiſe then you ſay; namely, to
prove unto the Jew, even out of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that the end of
the Law was not that they might be juſtified thereby, but
that by the impoſſibility of keeping it, they might be
driven to ſeek Juſtification from Chriſt by faith in another
Covenant; which Covenant of faith <hi>Moſes</hi> (though ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurely)
did intimate unto them in thoſe expreſſions, <hi>Say
not in thy heart,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The Word is nigh thee.</hi> By which he
meant no other then that Word of Faith, Goſpel, or
Covenant of Grace which the Apoſtle preached; the
ſum whereof was, That if thou confeſſe and believe, thou
ſhalt be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Come we to ſome other Texts formerly alledged to
prove a ſtipulation in the Covenant of Grace, and repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto by you in your Sermon. That out of <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.
touching the Covenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> was one. To
which you ſay, <hi>If any condition were required, then that
of Circumciſion, which ought alſo to be performed by all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Goſpel; ſo we ſhould obtrude Judaiſm upon Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> (My good friend) Are intimations of preaching
Judaiſme, Papiſme, and Arminianiſm no calumnies? Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
(I pray you) how you beſmear the adverſaries of
your Opinion to bring an <hi>odium</hi> upon them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> What you reply, ſerves only, <hi>ad faciendum
populum,</hi> there being no manner of Anſwer made unto
the Argument. For whether Circumciſion belong to us or
no, it was required of <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed; and the
ſoul that refuſed to take it, is ſaid to break the Covenant,
and was to be cut off, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. So that the Argument
remaines firme againſt you; yea, not at all reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
unto; which is this; <hi>The Covenant with Abraham
was the Covenant of free grace: But in the Covenant with
Abraham there was a Condition required of the federates,
Abraham and his Seed: Therefore in the Covenant
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:167980:21"/>
of free grace, there is a Condition required of the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As for that you ſay, We diſtinguiſh between
the external Signe of the Covenant, and the ſubſtance of
it. The one is alterable, the other remaines ſtil the ſame.
Now Circumciſion was but the external Sign of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
part. The things or duties God did eſpecially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
of <hi>Abraham,</hi> were faith and ſincere obedience,
<hi>Rom. 4 3. Gen.</hi> 17. 1. Now theſe belong to Chriſtians, as
much as to Jewes, and to preſſe them on Chriſtians is no
Judaiſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="g" place="margin">Circumciſio erat ſignum obligatorium foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratorum, ſeu reſtipulationis <hi>Abrahami,</hi> obligans eum &amp; poſtoros ad fidem &amp; obedientiam foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris Deo praeſtandam. <hi>Peraeus in Gen. 17. 11. Who adds, that both Sacraments, Circumciſion and Baptiſm, do agree, as in other ends, ſo in this,</hi> Quod utroque fit obligatio ſolennis ad fidem &amp; obedientiam oederis Deo praeſtandam. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                     </note> Circumciſion was a Sign
obligatory to thoſe which
were in Covenant; or a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of the reſtipulation of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
obliging him and his
poſterity to faith and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Covenant to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
to God. <hi>ſaith</hi> Paraeus.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I conceive that mandate from the external
ſigne of Circumciſion to reach to us Chriſtians. Though
not in the letter, yet in the Analogy, and by vertue of
it Chriſtians ſtand to be baptized themſelves; alſo to
bring their ſeed to partake of that Sacrament, which as
the Apoſtle teacheth us, is our Chriſtian Circumciſion;
and he that wilfully refuſeth may be ſaid to break the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,
as well as he that formerly refuſed Circumciſion.
The ſame Covenant which gave a Commandment or
Word of Reſtipulation for that Circumciſion of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
and his Seed, giveth the ſame commandment or Word
of Juſtification for Baptiſm of Believers and our ſeed, ſaith

were</hi> Heb. 8. 10. Heb. 2. 23. <hi>To which you reply by Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation:</hi>
Is there any condition on mans part intimated
here? Doth not God promiſe to do all? Doth he ſay, If you
will be my people?</p>
                  <p>1. Sir, what you me an by that expreſſion, <hi>Doth not
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:167980:21"/>
God promiſe to do all?</hi> I wiſt not, Mr. <hi>Saltmarſh</hi> ſaith,
<hi>It is enough for us to believe that Chriſt hath repented for us,
believed for us.</hi> But I hope you are not ſo far gone. If
you by it underſtand Gods gracious inabling of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to perform the conditions he himſelfe requireth, I
readily joyne with you. It is he gives us to repent and
to believe, as hath been ſaid already. But then I
hope you will diſtinguiſh between, <hi>Gods gift and mans du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;</hi>
though the <hi>Ability</hi> be given of God, the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of
it, or <hi>work</hi> is mans. It is man himſelf that believeth and
repenteth, though he receive ability from the Lord for
both.</p>
                  <p>2. We anſwer your Demand, <hi>Is there any condition on
mans part?</hi> Yes, that there is; namely this, <hi>They ſhall
be my people.</hi> Can they be his people without dutiful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
and obedience to him? Here is this then, that
God requires of them, that if they would have him
to be a God to them, to pardon them, defend them, ſave
them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then they ſhould take him for their God,
depend on him, ſubmit to him, obey, worſhip, and ſerve
him, and carry themſelves towards him as become his
people:<note n="i" place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>They ſhall ſay, Thou art my God:</hi> Upon which
<hi>Paraeus</hi> gloſſeth,<note n="k" place="margin">Dicere Dei eſt efficere; dicam ego, <hi>i. e.</hi> efficiam populum meum. Dicere noſtrum eſt fides &amp; obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dientia noſtra.</note> 
                     <hi>God ſaith, we are his people, making us to
be his people. Our faith and our obedience is our ſaying, The
Lord is our God.</hi> Nor is it material that God doth not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally
condition with them, ſaying, If you will be my
people, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The reſtipulation required, is no whit the
leſſe firm, when in the next Chapter the Prophet ſaith,
<note n="l" place="margin">Chap 3. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Only thou ſhalt abide for me many dayes;</hi> and not, if thou
wilt abide for me: it was nevertheleſſe a conjugal
Compact. The cauſe of this kinde of expreſſion may be
either 1. for brevities ſake: or ſecondly, as Mr. <hi>Ball</hi> notes,
God enters into Covenant with man, not as his equall,
but as his Superiour or Soveraign, appointing man his
conditions in form of commands, which it's mans duty to
accept of and obey: Or 3. Which I ſhould rather
chuſe, to intimate thereby his gracious purpoſe of giving
ability to perfom the Conditions, <hi>I will put my Lawes in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:167980:22"/>
their hearts. They ſhall be my people; i e.</hi> I will not only
require of them, that they know my Lawes, and obey
me as becomes my people; but by my Grace, I wil cauſe
it to be wrought within them. Whether way you take it,
either for Gods command injoyning them to be his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
or for his promiſe to make them his people, it is
not much material; this ſtill remaines either way, that
they were to be his people. And this we have, even from
the moſt abſolute Promiſes, thoſe of taking the ſtony
heart away, giving a heart of fleſh, a new heart, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing
the heart, writing the Law on the heart; which
admit not, as I conceive, any antecedent condition, yet
do they clearly ſhew that theſe things are required. This
new heart is required, the writing the Law on the heart
is required, and ſo of the reſt: God doth require them
in his people, and without men have them, they
cannot be the people of God, nor expect ſalvation from
God.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things (Sir) perſwade me, notwithſtanding
all that you have hitherto replied, to adhere ſtill to what
I have formerly conceived and delivered concerning theſe
Texts; <hi>viz.</hi> That they do hold out a ſtipulation in
the Covenant, and then it will be conditional. Now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this work is ſwollen bigger by the one half al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
then (when I ſet pen to paper) I intended it ſhould
have been, I ſhall briefly add ſome more Arguments,
and draw toward a cloſe: And becauſe we are upon ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulations
in the Covenant, add we an Argument or two
of that nature.</p>
                  <p>1. <hi>That Covenant which is mandatory as well as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſory,
and contains a Law as well as a promiſe, that
Covenant hath a ſtipulation which they muſt ſubſcribe
to, who will be federates and Covenanters therein; for
whenever the Lord annexeth a command unto a Promiſe,
the Promiſe is not abſolute but conditional: there is
ſomething required in the command of him who will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy
the benefit of the Promiſe. Now the New Covenant
is of this nature; it is not a meer Promiſe (as ſome would
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:167980:22"/>
have it) but a Law as well as a Promiſe, and therefore
called by the Apoſtle,</hi> The Law of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 27.
<note place="margin">Lex fidei do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrina fidei. quae fidem exagit, per quam ſine operi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus expectatur à Deo juſtitia. Alio nomine lex Evangelii. <hi>Par. &amp; Mart. in loc.</hi>
                     </note> The Law of faith is that Doctrine which doth require faith
to the obtaining of that Righteouſneſſe which is freely impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<hi>ſaith</hi> Paraeus. That is the Law of Works which teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that Righteouſneſſe is to be obtained by Works but the Law
of faith teacheth, it is to be hoped for from the mercy of God
alone, <hi>ſaith</hi> Martyr. The Doctrine teaching Righteouſneſs
by faith, is that which the Word of the Goſpel doth bind us to
if we will be ſaved, <hi>ſaith</hi> Bernard <hi>in his</hi> Theſaur. The
Condition which offereth and promiſeth Salvation, is this
Condition, If wee believe. Wilſon <hi>in his</hi> Dictionary <hi>on the
words.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That Covenant which man is forbidden to break,
commanded to keep, and wherein man is tyed and bound
unto God; that Covenant muſt needs have conditions
and reſtipulations on mans part; for it is in regard of the
things required from man, that man is ſaid to break or
keep, or be bound by the Covenant. But ſuch is the New
Covenant. <hi>Abrahams</hi> was ſuch, <hi>My Covenant ſhalt
thou keep,</hi> Gen. 17. 9. <hi>Davids</hi> was ſuch (though you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verred
the contrary in your Sermon) <hi>Pſal. 132. 12. If
thy children will keep my Covenant.</hi> Such was <hi>Iſraels,
Ezek. 20. 37. I will make you to paſſe under the rod, and
bring you into the bond of the Covenant:</hi> and what Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
doth he mean but that mentioned, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36. 26. and
<hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.? The places conſidered ſeem to me to hold out
one and the ſame. Such is alſo that adminiſtration of it
under which we are. The Romans were<note n="n" place="margin">Rom. 6. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>free from righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi>
before they believed on Chriſt, and entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Covenant with him; but after they were baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Chriſt they were<note n="o" place="margin">Ver. 18, 19, 20</note> 
                     <hi>Servants unto Righteouſneſſe.</hi> The
ſtile of Gods people formerly was, they were Covenant
keepers, <hi>Pſal. 25. 10. Pſal.</hi> 103. 17. And is it not as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to them now, as it was then? May not the people
of God under the Goſpel be guilty of breach of Covenant,
and that not only in regard of their Covenants with men,
nor yet in regard of thoſe neceſſary engagements which
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:167980:23"/>
occaſionally they make unto the Lord, but in regard of
their Baptiſm,<note place="margin">See <hi>Dr. Preſton N. Coven.</hi> p. 458 459. 500. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> and that ſolemne Covenant between God
and them, which Baptiſm doth ſeal. I have not quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> Catechiſm, which I learned when I
was a child, where I was taught in the fift Principle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,
to anſwer this Queſtion, <hi>How comes it to paſſe that
many after their Baptiſm for a long time feel not the effect and
fruit of it, and ſome never?</hi> Thus anſwered, <hi>The fault is not in
God who keeps his Covenant, but the fault is in themſelves,
in that they do not keep the condition of the Covenant, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
Chriſt by faith, and repent of all their ſins.</hi> And a little
after, <hi>How if a man never keep the Condition to which he bound
himſelf in Baptiſm?</hi> Anſwer, <hi>His damnation ſhall be
greater, becauſe he breaks his Vow made unto God.</hi> Mr. <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins</hi>
you ſee, teacheth Conditions in the New Covenant,
in regard of which it may be kept or broken by us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.</p>
                  <p>3 This brings to my mind another Argument; That
Covenant wherein a Promiſe is required of the federates,
which Promiſe they do alſo ſeal to God in receiving of
the Covenant Seal, that Covenant hath a reſtipulation;
But ſuch is the new Covenant. For the confirmation of
the Minor, I deſire you to conſider how in the Primitive
times growne perſons were required to profeſſe their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
and faith in Chriſt before they were admitted
unto Baptiſm. <hi>Repent</hi> (ſaith <hi>Peter, Acts 2) and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized:</hi>
Whence alſo it is called the <hi>Baptiſm of Repentance;
Mark 1. 4. Acts</hi> 19. 4. And <hi>John</hi> is ſaid to <hi>Baptiſe men
unto repentance,</hi> Mat. 3. 11. So when the <hi>Eunuch</hi> deſired
Baptiſm of <hi>Philip.</hi> Acts 8. 36, 37. ſaying, <hi>What doth hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
me to be baptized? Philip</hi> replyes, <hi>That if he believed
with all his heart, he might;</hi> whereupon followed both his
confeſſion of Faith and Baptiſm. The Baptiſt alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
thoſe whom he baptized to bring forth fruits wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
amendment of life. From which places <hi>Zanchy</hi> and
<hi>Piſcator</hi> collect, that faith and Repentance and new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience,
were required of all thoſe grownperſons who were
baptized, they were to make profeſſion of their repentance
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:167980:23"/>
and faith, and to make Promiſe of new Obedience. Take
<hi>Piſcators</hi> note upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.<note n="p" place="margin">Baptiſmus nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li adulto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferendus eſt, niſi priu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Baptiſm is to be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred
to no perſon that is of years, unleſſe he ſhall firſt of all
make a confeſſion of ſins, and of faith in Chriſt, and withal
a Promiſe of leading a holy life.</hi> Theſe Profeſſions were
afterward for the eaſe of the party to be baptized, turned
into Interrogations and Anſwers: The Miniſter deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
of the party to be baptized, <hi>Doſt thou believe in God?</hi>
the party was wont to anſwer, <hi>I do believe.</hi> The Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
again inquiring. <hi>Doſt thou renounce the Divel? &amp;c.</hi>
he replyed, <hi>I do renounce.</hi> Which Anſwer when Infants
could not make of themſelves, they had Parents and Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
who made it for them. Thus was there a formal ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation
required of growne perſons at their firſt admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
into Covenant and the adminiſtration of the ſeal of
the Covenant to him.</p>
                  <p>Farther, As before baptiſm, growne perſons did thus
profeſſe and promiſe, ſo by being baptized did they ſeal.
For this Seal of Baptiſm, as it is Gods ſeal to us aſſuring
us of remiſſion and other benefits promiſed in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant:
ſo is it alſo the Chriſtians Seal unto God, whereby
he ſeals the promiſe of Repentance, Faith and new Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience:
Hence are they ſaid to be baptized into Chriſt;
into his Death, into the Name of the Father, Son and
Holy Ghoſt.</p>

                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:167980:24"/>
Thus much at preſent concerning Reſtipulation in
the Covenant; paſſe we on to ſome other Arguments:
and becauſe I remember you told me, that I had in my
Sermons a number of Citations out of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
you ſhall hear ſome more of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
I uſed then, for ſome of them I have ſet down
already.</p>
                  <p>To what hath been ſaid add then, Gods mercies are
to be obtained in Gods way, that way and manner which
God hath from all eternity pitched on therein to bring
men to the enjoyment of theſe mercies: But God hath
from all eternity purpoſed to give Remiſſion, Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
Adoption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as through Chriſt (for he hath
<hi>predeſtinated us to the Adoption of children, through Jeſus
Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 1. 5, 7.) ſo through faith in Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in a
way of repentance, <hi>Rom. 3. 25, 28. chap. 8. 28. Acts 13. 38,
39, 48. chap. 5 31. chap.</hi> 11. 18. Therefore till men actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repent and believe, they cannot actually partake of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
Adoption, Juſtification, and thoſe other benefits
and purchaſes of Chriſts paſſion.</p>
                  <p>Againe, thoſe mercies which the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
propoſe and promiſe unto men, not abſolutely, but
on termes of Repentance and Faith: they are not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,
but upon performance of the propoſed termes to be
expected; but the faithful meſſengers of God, both in the
Old and New Teſtament, do both proffer and promiſe
remiſſion in this manner.</p>
                  <p>Look into the Sermons of the Prophets, and we ſhal
find in their fulleſt and higheſt deſcriptions of free grace
and offers of mercy, they ſtill require repentance of men.
So <hi>Iſai. 1. Though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as
white as ſnow.</hi> But when? when they ſhould ſeriouſly ſet
upon the practice of Repentance: for ſo in the words
foregoing, <hi>Waſh ye, ceaſe to doe evil, &amp;c. Come now and
let us reaſon.</hi> No parley at all before this to be expected So
<hi>cha.</hi> 55. a place much inſiſted on by Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> for to prove
the abſolute freeneſſe now in hand. There are many
things required, as thirſting, coming, hearing, ſeeking,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:167980:25"/>
calling, forſaking of ſin, and turning unto God. So
the other Prophets, <hi>Jer. 3. 12, 13, 14. Ezek. 18. 31, 32.
chap. 33. 11. chap. 36. 26, 27. Zach.</hi> 1. 3. Now whereas
you told me, That theſe were proofs out of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament,
I hope you neither deny proofs thence to be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentical,
nor yet the Prophets then to have been Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
of free grace. The Covenant (I hope) was for
ſubſtance the ſame then that it is now; not a conditional
one then,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luth. Gal 3. verſ.</hi> 19. All the Faithful have had al way one and the ſelf ſame Goſpel, and by that they were ſaved.</note> and an abſolute one now. <hi>The Fathers of the

that may fit them for the receipt of the benefits promiſed
in the New Covenant. As <hi>John</hi> was, ſo are they to be Chriſts

1 Theſſ. 2. 16. <hi>To open their eyes and to bring them
from darkneſſe to light, and from the kingdom of Satan unto
God, that they may receive remiſſion of ſins, &amp;c.</hi> Acts 26

captive, and haſt received gifts for men, even for the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious,
that the Lord God may dwell among them,</hi> Pſal. 68. 18
On which Dr. <hi>Criſp</hi> thus gloſſeth, <hi>Vol. 2. p. 410. Who is
that Them? The Rebellious ſaith the Text:</hi> And p. 412. <hi>The
Holy Ghoſt doth not ſay that the Lord takes Rebellious perſons
and fits and prepares them by Sanctification, and then when
they are fitted, he will come and dwell with them; but even
then, without any intermiſſion, without any ſtop, even when they
are rebellious the Lord Chriſt hath received gifts for them, that
the Lord God may dwell among them:</hi> Thus the Doctor.
But certainly the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was more acquainted with
the mind of the Holy Ghoſt then Dr. <hi>Criſp:</hi> now he, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ</hi>
4. 8. alledging this of the Pſalmiſt, openeth it far
otherwiſe, and delivereth it, ſo as to me it ſeemes full for
the confirmation of that we have in hand: <hi>When</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>he aſcended up on high, he led captivity captive, and
gave gifts to men:</hi> I hope he gave no other then what he
received for them. Now what gave he? It followes,
<hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, and ſome Prophets, and ſome Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts,
and ſome Paſtors and Teachers:</hi> and for what end?
<hi>For the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry,
for the edifying of the body of Chriſt; till we come, &amp;c.</hi>
He did not then receive this gift, that though they were
rebellious, the Lord God might dwell among them whilſt
they remained ſo, as the Doctor avers. But on the
contrary, he received and gave abroad theſe gifts of the
Miniſterial function, that thereby people might bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
off their rebellious principles, and broken off their
rebellious practices, and fitted for the communion with
the Moſt High: The ſum is, the Miniſters of the Word
are ſent on this buſineſſe to prepare people for the Lord,
for remiſſion and ſalvation; therefore there is ſomething
required of them, ſome work to be wrought in them, on
them, before they can actually partake of remiſſion or
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:167980:26"/>
ſalvation from the Lord, or enjoy communion with the
Lord.</p>
                  <p>4. That which theſe Miniſters of the Goſpel have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
ſinners to do for the obtaining of Remiſſion, Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,
and Salvation, that in order of nature is to be
done before Remiſſion, Juſtification and Salvation can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
be obtained: But the Miniſters of the Goſpel
have directed ſinners to repent and believe for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of, <hi>&amp;c. Acts 2 38. chap. 3. 19. chap. 16 30, 31. Gal.</hi>
2. 16. Nor was it remiſſion or juſtification <hi>in cognoſcend,</hi>
only, that they were directed to ſeek in this way of faith
and repentance. Can any imagine that the meaning of
that Query of the Jaylor, <hi>Sirs, what ſhall I do to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi>
ſhould be no more then this, What ſhall I do to
be certified and aſſured of my Salvation? Beſides, that
Juſtification, that <hi>Paul</hi> did himſelf, and directed others to
ſeek by faith, <hi>Rom. 3. 28. Gal.</hi> 2. 16. was ſuch in which
works have no hand. But to Juſtification <hi>in cognoſcendo,</hi>
or <hi>in foro conſcentiae,</hi> to the evidencing to us, and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
us that we are juſtified, works do concur, <hi>James 2.
16. 24. A man is juſtified</hi> (aſſured of Juſtification) <hi>by
Works, and not by faith only.</hi> So that the other Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
muſt be of another and different kinde, works
being wholly excluded from having any thing to do
therein.</p>
                  <p>5. They who are in an eſtate of wrath and death un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til
they do believe, and then upon their believing paſſe out
of that eſtate into an eſtate of life; they are not actually
juſtified till they do believe: But the Elect are in ſuch an
eſtate of wrath and death till they do actually believe
<hi>Epheſ. 2. Children of wrath,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Preſton N. Coven.</hi> p. 398. When a man doth this, at that very hour hee is entered into Covenant, he is tranſlated from death to life.</note> 
                     <hi>even as others.</hi> Tit. 3. 3. and then
when they believe, they paſſe out of that eſtate. 1 <hi>John 3
14. We know we are paſſed from death to life.</hi> Under the
power of death we were then, otherwiſe we could not
have paſſed from it. And when paſſed we from it? the
ſame Apoſtle in his Goſpel tells us, <hi>John 5. 24. chap. 3. ult.</hi>
in one of which places he aſſures us, that <hi>he that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
and believeth, is paſſed:</hi> and in the other, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:167980:26"/>
not, the wrath of God ſtil abides on him;</hi> which terms
of <hi>paſſing</hi> and <hi>abiding,</hi> clearly ſhew that all the Elect are,
and continue actually in that woful eſtate, until they do
believe. I hope you will not ſay, they paſſe in their own
ſenſe and apprehenſion, and ſo are children of wrath
according to their apprehenſions. The Apoſtle
ſaith, <hi>They are children of wrath even as others:</hi> and
certainly others are not only ſenſibly and appearingly ſo,
nay, perhaps neither of theſe wayes, but really ſo. For
my part, I conceive no difference between a veſſel
of Election and a veſſel of wrath, but only in regard of
Gods purpoſe and Chriſts purchaſe, which til it be brought
into act doth make no real change in the parties ſtate and
condition.</p>
                  <p>6. Until men come actually to have Chriſt, to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
unto him, and one with him, they cannot partake of
Juſtification, nor have any right thereto, 1 <hi>John 5. 12.
He that hath the Son hath life, he that hath not the Son, hath
not life.</hi> But until men have faith they have not Chriſt,
nor are united to him, for by faith they <hi>receive him,</hi>
John 1. 12. <hi>go to him,</hi> John 6. 35, 37. <hi>Feed on him; dwell
in him, and he in them,</hi> John 6. 40 56. <hi>By faith they live
in him, and he in them,</hi> Gal. 2. 20. <hi>By faith he dwelleth in
their hearts,</hi> Epheſ. 3. 17. <hi>Ergo,</hi> Until men have faith,
and by faith do actually believe on him, they
cannot partake of Juſtification through him, <hi>John</hi>
3. 36.</p>
                  <p>I remember that when in a private conference I preſſed
ſome of theſe places of Scripture, in ſtead of anſwering to
them, you demanded, <hi>Whether the Elect had no benefit by
Chriſt, nor right to Chriſt before they did believe?</hi> To which
I replyed,</p>
                  <p>1. That though there be a purpoſe in God to give ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
to them, and a purchaſe of it by Chriſt for them, yet
had they no right thereunto until they had faith.</p>
                  <p>2 That they might have benefit by Chriſt before they
had right to Chriſt, as in the inſtant of their Converſion,
when the Spirit of Chriſt did work faith and repentance
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:167980:27"/>
in them. That firſt Benefit (they had (I conceive) in
order of nature, though not in time, before they had
right, it being the very conveyance of right over to them,
and ſtating them therein,) muſt precede their having of
right, or otherwiſe they ſhould have right before they had
it. This you told me then was <hi>groſſe nonſenſe;</hi> and ſince
you have averred in Pulpit, that <hi>to ſay men have benefit and
not right, is palpable nonſenſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But 1. Sir, Whether nonſenſe or no, what is it you
ſay to the places cited? Theſe Texts tell me plainly that
unleſſe I have faith, I have not Chriſt, and that unleſſe I
have Chriſt I cannot have life, no nor right to, or intereſt
in it; unleſſe a man may have right to, and intereſt in
life through Chriſt, and yet for all not live, but periſh e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſtingly:
which I think will be worſe then nonſenſe
to aver: So that the Argument remains firm and unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
                  <p>2 For your Crimination, though you might have dealt
more fairly, and produced the manner of our aſſerting it,
as well as the aſſertion it ſelf; yet we muſt be content to
take what you give, and as you give it, and ſhall caſt it
up into the ſachel to the other Legacies you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
on us; as Arminianiſm, Papiſm, Judaiſme, abſolute
contradictions and weak evaſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3 For the groſſe and palpable nonſenſe it ſelf, Benefit
and not right. I muſt profeſſe unto you, that as groſſe
and palpable as it is, my dull pate doth not yet appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
it. All the while the father lives, the child hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
by his fathers means, but what right he hath thereto
I know not: the coats he wears, the food he eats, are not his
own by right, I think, but his Fathers; yea when the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
dies and gives a Legacy to his child to be paid at ſuch
an age, until the child come to that age it cannot chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
the Legacy or portion given him by his father, nor
diſpoſe of it, if he dye before, yet hath he benefit thereby;
if he hath <hi>jus ad rem,</hi> a right to the thing, he hath not
<hi>jus in re,</hi> a right in the thing, until that period of time, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the Donation of his father. But to come
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:167980:27"/>
yet nearer to the matter in hand. Suppoſe that ſome
poor woman caſt in priſon for debt, where ſhe is like to
periſh, ſhould haply meet with a rich friend, who pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her ſad condition, and taking an affection to her,
ſhould procure her inlargement out of priſon, intending
to wed and marry her: I hope here it would be no non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe
to ſay, that this woman had benefit by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
husband, before ſhe had right to him, and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in him: for, till the match or contract ſhe cannot
have any right in him at all. The caſe is ours, we are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
to God, and in priſon too, the Lord by his Spirit
delivering us, doth make us his heavenly Bride. This firſt
benefit, our delivering out of bonds, we muſt have in
ſome meaſure from Chriſt, in order of Nature, before
we can give our conſent to the Match, and by faith take
the Lord Jeſus for our husband. May we not ſay in this
caſe that we have benefit? <hi>viz.</hi> the grand benefit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation
by him, before we have right to him? Is it
nonſenſe to ſay ſo? I am ſure Mr. <hi>Thomas Goodwin</hi> writes
ſomething after this manner,<note n="v" place="margin">Chriſt ſet forth in his Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> p. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>The promiſes of forgiveneſſe
are not as the pardon of a Prince, which meerly contein an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of his royal word for pardoning; ſo as we in ſeeking of
it, do reſt upon, and have to do only with his word and Seal,
which we have to ſhew for it: but Gods promiſes of pardon
are made in his Son, and are as if a Prince ſhould offer to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
a Traitor upon mariage with his child, whom in, and with
that pardon he offers in ſuch a relation, ſo as all that would
have pardon, muſt firſt ſeek out for his child: And thus it
is in the matter of believing; the reaſon of which is, becauſe
Chriſt is the grand promiſe, in whom all the Promiſes are Yea
and Amen.</hi> 2 Cor. 1. 20. <hi>The Intereſt in a heireſſe Lands
goes with her perſon, and with the relation of mariage to her:
ſo all the Promiſes hang on Chriſt, and without him, there is
no intereſt to be had in them.</hi> So Mr. <hi>Reynolds Life of Chriſt
p.</hi> 466. tells me, <hi>That till there be this conſent on our ſide,
it is but a wooing, there is no marriage, no Covenant made.</hi>
Pag. 478. <hi>That our union and communion with Chriſt, is on
our part the work of Faith, whoſe office it is to unite to Chriſt
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:167980:28"/>
and gaine poſſeſſion of him.</hi> Yea, <hi>Luther</hi> alſo on <hi>Gal. 2 20.
Faith therefore muſt be purely taught, namely, that thou
art ſo entirely joyned to Chriſt, as that thou maiſt ſay, I am
one with Chriſt, his righteonſneſſe and Victory are mine, &amp;c.
For by faith we are joyned ſo together, that wee are become
one fleſh and one bone. So that this faith doth couple Christ
and me more neer together, then the husband is coupled to his
wife.</hi> And Dr. <hi>Preſton New Coven. p.</hi> 458. avers the
ſame.</p>
                  <p>Sir, theſe men know how to write ſenſe; now they tel
us, that our right comes through our marriage with Chriſt,
and that ſpiritual match is not made up untill we believe,
which be the two main pieces of that you call groſſe non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe
For, as for the third, that we cannot believe till
God for Chriſts ſake vouchſafe us that benefit, that they
all maintain it, I need not tell you. In fine your nonſenſe
beſpeaks you in this Argument, which perhaps may
puzzle both your ſenſes and intellectuals ſolidly to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer.</p>
                  <p>All that be united unto Chriſt, and quickned by him,
before they have right to him, do receive ſpecial benefits
from him before they have right to him: But all the
Elect are united unto Chriſt and quickned by him, before
they have right to him, or to ſalvation through him:
<hi>Ergo,</hi> All the Elect do receive ſpecial benefits by Chriſt,
before they have right to him, or to ſalvation through him.
Or, All that have union before they have right have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
before they have right; But all the Elect have union
before they have right; <hi>Ergo,</hi> All the Elect have benefit
before they have right.</p>
                  <p>But we have right to thoſe benefits <hi>(ſay you)</hi> by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of Gods Largeſs and Donation. <hi>The ſame I alſo find in</hi>
                     <note n="w" place="margin">Jus &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prictas doni ex donantis benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca largitione re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultai: acciperet aliàs non ſuum donatorius quum rem donatam teneret. <hi>Cor. p.</hi> 127.</note> 
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Ames.</p>
                  <p>But this I conceive to hold true onely in abſolute
Grants; for if the Gift or Grant be conditional, then is
there a right unto the benefit granted, when that conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is wrought in the Legatee, and not before. <hi>Swynborn</hi>
in his Treatiſe of <hi>Teſtaments, p.</hi> 150. tels us, That if the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:167980:28"/>
Teſtator give his daughter an hundred pounds, if ſhe
marry with advice and approbation of her Uncle, in caſe
the party marry without adviſing with her Uncle about it,
ſhe loſeth her right to the Legacy given her; (which by the
way, may ſhew the weakneſs of that Argument that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the word Teſtament, which ſome uſe againſt
Conditions: as if Conditions could not ſtand with a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtamentary
diſpoſition) Now ſuch is Gods grant of
ſalvation: it is made in Chriſt, it is made in him unto
Believers; it is not made to ſinners, as ſinners, as ſome
aver, but to repenting and believing ſinners, <hi>John 6. 38.
39, 40. This is the will of him that ſent me, that every one
that ſeeth the Son and believeth on him, have everlaſting life.</hi>
The Grant being made unto us as Believers, I conceive
we have not right unto the benefit granted until we doe
believe. Sure I am, we cannot have right, but by and
through our union to him; which union being an ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable
benefit, we cannot have right before we have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</p>
                  <p>7. Becauſe you are ſo ready to charge your Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
with nonſenſe and contradictions,<note place="margin">Qui alterum incuſai probri ipſum ſe intueri oporiet.</note> let us mind you of
the old rule, He that accuſeth another of diſhoneſty, muſt
look well to himſelf: and let the inconſequences which
neceſſarily follow from your Doctrine be our laſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
I beſeech you therefore to read me thoſe riddles
your Tenents ſeem to me to contain; and to lead me out
of thoſe mazes and Meanders which I think your Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
lead unto, at leaſt to deliver your ſelf out of them;
for perhaps my ſenſes may not lead me to follow your clue
unleſſe I ſee better ſolutions then I have ſeene or heard
from you hitherto. I beſeech you tell me then,</p>
                  <p>1. How there can be <hi>Many,</hi> yea or <hi>any true Believers
who were never humbled,</hi> when yet all men muſt ſee their
Righteouſneſſe droſſe and dung, muſt be ſchooled by the
Law to know their need of Chriſt, before they can or will
make out unto him?</p>
                  <p>2. How the ſame man may be actually reconciled to
God, have wrath removed from him, and be beloved of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:167980:29"/>
God with the love of complacency,<note place="margin">See this diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency and compaſſion confirmed by <hi>Rutherford</hi> his <hi>Survey of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomianiſm.</hi>
                     </note> and yet at the ſame
time in regard of the ſame evil works, be an enemy unto
God, a child of wrath, and have wrath abiding on
him?</p>
                  <p>3. How the ſame man may be actually juſtified and
quickned, and yet actually dead in regard of the ſame ſins,
at the ſame time?</p>
                  <p>4. How the ſame man at the ſame time can be a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Chriſt, one in him, and united to him, as he muſt
be who is actually juſtified, and a member alſo of the divel,
as he cannot but be who ſtill remains an ungodly, impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and unbelieving perſon?</p>
                  <p>5. How faith in the work of Juſtification ſerves for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
farther uſe then to aſſure us that we are juſtified, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it doth not concur to the eſſence and being of it, or
to the conſtituting of us in a ſtate juſtifiable? and how
we are ſaid to be juſtified by Faith and not by Works,
when Works aſſure us of our being juſtified as well as
Faith.</p>
                  <p>6 How in the Petition, <hi>Forgive us our debts,</hi> we can
pray for any thing more then aſſurance of pardon, when
actual pardon is paſſed long before? And how ſins can be
actually pardoned before they be committed, and the guilt
removed before it is contracted?</p>
                  <p>7 How God who promiſeth pardon to Believers only,
and condemneth thouſands for their impenitency and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief,
can without blemiſh of his Honour, Truth,
and Juſtice, give pardon to any in his impenitency and
unbelief?</p>
                  <p>8 How a man can be ſaid to be bound by Covenant,
to keep or break the Covenant, when yet in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
there are no conditions on mans part required to be
performed?</p>
                  <p>9 Why it doth not follow from your Tenents, that
a man may be actually Juſtified and ſaved without faith,
when yet you maintain actual Juſtification before faith and
faith to be required not to the eſſence of it, or intereſting
of perſons in it, but only to the aſſuring them of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
therein?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="57" facs="tcp:167980:29"/>
10. Why it follows not alſo from them, that Chriſtians
may live as they liſt, ſeeing you hold that no conditions
are on their part required, ſo that they cannot break the
Covenant? Whether Doctor <hi>Preſton</hi> dares the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever
to ſin if hee can, I yet finde not; but
this I find, That hee holds that the Believer may
both ſin, and by ſinning may break the Covenant, as you
may find in his Treatiſe of the New Covenant. <hi>p. 458, 459
460. &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are ſome of the many (for more might be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med)
ſtraites and intricacies, your Poſitions lead your
ſelf and your followers into; out of which, how you will
rid your ſelf I wot not: but ſure I am, that your Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
hitherto given, do yeild no manner of real ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
not only, not to my ſelf, but not to any other of
your godly and intelligent Auditors, that I have yet met
with.</p>
                  <p>Toward the cloſe of your Sermon, you uſhered in your
Authorities with this Objection, <hi>But many good Divines
call it a Conditional Covenant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Sir, you are meal mouthed in the very Objection;
for <hi>not only many,</hi> but <hi>the moſt part of Divines</hi> call it ſo.
All that I have ever yet met with, Dr. <hi>Criſp,</hi> Mr. <hi>Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marſh,</hi>
and your ſelf exepted. As for thoſe Authors you
bring, I ſhall by and by ſhew your fowle play in citing
ſome of them, and your miſtake of others; and diſcover
moſt, if not all of them to be on my ſide, and to be only
againſt meritorious Conditions. The like mincing you u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
in a paſſage in the beginning of your Sermon; <hi>viz.
That ſome good Divines ſay; That Faith and Repentance are
the way to glory.</hi> Whereas if you be pleaſed to rub your
poll, I believe you may call to mind, not only that
ſome, but moſt good Divines <hi>call theſe Conditions,</hi> and ſay
as much of good Works as you here allow to Faith;
namely, that they are <hi>via ad regnum,</hi> the way to the
Kingdom, though not <hi>Cauſa regnandi,</hi> the cauſe of reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
I am ſure Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Dave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
and moſt others I have read, do call them ſo. But
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:167980:30"/>
you are politick in theſe expreſſions; for thereby you
would perſwade your hearers, that you had many on
your ſide; like ſome Travellers who paſſing on in ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
wayes, keep a whiſtling and a hooping as if they had
a great deal of company, whereas alas they are either
wholly alone, or at moſt have but one or two Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>Now Sir, for your reply to this Objection, we ſhall
refer it to the cloſe of all, and at preſent ſhall look into
the Authours you bring, and ſee whether they ſtand for
the opinion for which you cited them, or rather againſt
it, as ſhall be made to appear; and then ſhall add ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to them.</p>
                  <p>You begin with the Fathers, but there you are ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in your citations; you tell us the Queſtion was rarely
agitated then. But you might have ſaid, that the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
if they faulted in any thing about the matter in
Controverſie; it was in giving too much to Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tauce
and good Works, by their hyperbolical commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of them, ſtiling them meritorious, and the like; as
both Mr. <hi>Gataker</hi> in his <hi>Rejoynder to Mr. Saltmarſh, p.</hi> 53.
and Biſhop <hi>Davenant, de Juſtit. Actual. cap.</hi> 53. Men
better verſ'd in the Fathers then you or I, will tell you.

free will aſſerted by <hi>Pelagius.</hi> The ſame Authour will

was required of us if we would be partakers of the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
purchaſed; that it was required of us before our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
Juſtification, and did concur thereto.</p>
                  <p>Paſſe we from theſe to later Writers, among whom,
let <hi>Martin Luther</hi> be the firſt. Now it is true, that in
the place you cited, he ſaith, <hi>The Promiſes of the Law are
conditional, but the Promiſes of the New Teſtament have no
ſuch conditions, nor require any thing of us, nor depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:167980:31"/>
on any Conditions of our worthineſſe.</hi> But here I conceive
he excludes <hi>meritorious Conditions,</hi> partly, becauſe he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
himſelf very cautelouſly, ſaying, <hi>No ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
and no conditions of our worthineſſe.</hi> And alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he doth elſewhere often aver, that ſomething is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of us. I might here mind you of what <hi>Chemnicius</hi>
ſaith in the place before cited, who being a Lutheran,
could not but be better acquainted with <hi>Luthers</hi> Tenents
then you or I; namely, that <hi>Luther</hi> was not againſt
<hi>Preparations of order,</hi> but only <hi>Preparations of merit;</hi> and for
proof of it, cites him on the third Chapter to the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
where we find <hi>verſ.</hi> 30. this paſſage, <hi>The uſe of the
Law is to terrifie and fright to Chriſt, who is the end of the
Law for Righteouſneſſe.</hi> And <hi>verſ. 2. Chriſts coming pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits
neither the careleſſe nor the deſperate, but only ſuch who
have been tormented and terrified with the Law for a time,
and now with ſure truſt come to Chriſt.</hi> Which paſſages
do clearly ſhew, that he held, there ought to be a work
of the Law upon the heart before its cloſe with Chriſt,
not to make it worthy of Chriſt, but to make it long and
gaſp after Chriſt. I might tell you alſo, How in a Letter
written to Mr. <hi>Gaſper Guttil,</hi> and tranſlated by Mr. <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therford,</hi>
the ſame <hi>Martin Luther</hi> vehemently inveighs
againſt thoſe who would have the Doctrine of Grace to
be preached in the firſt place, and afterwards the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of wrath, calling it a <hi>new method, a curious crotchet,</hi>
and the broachers of it <hi>jugling Gypſies;</hi> and averreth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly,
that <hi>the Apoſtles method,</hi> Rom. 1. 2, 3. <hi>was directly
oppoſite thereto, which was firſt to denounce the wrath of
God from heaven, and make all the world ſinners and guilty
before God; then when they ſee this, to teach them farther
how they may obtain grace and be juſtified.</hi> As alſo that
notable place on <hi>Gal. 2. 16. The true way to Chriſtianity is
this, that a man do firſt acknowledge himſelf by the Law to be
a ſinner.</hi> A little after, <hi>When a man is thus taught and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
by the Law, then he is terrified and humbled, then
he ſeeth indeed the greatneſs of his ſin, and cannot find in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
one ſpark of the Law of God; therefore he juſtifieth God
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:167980:32"/>
in his Word,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Like to which he hath ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paſſage: The true office of the Law, which can be never enough magnified, is to ſhew us our ſins, to humble us, kil us, bring us down to hel, that we may be juſtified. <hi>Cha. 3 vſ. 23. ad fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>and confeſſeth that he is guilty of death and
eternal damnation. The firſt part then of Chriſtianity is the
preaching of repentance, and the knowledg of our ſelves.</hi> And
ſome few lines after, <hi>The Law doth nothing elſe but utter
ſin, terrifie and humble, and by this meanes prepareth us to
Juſtification, and driveth us to Chriſt.</hi> And about two
leaves after, <hi>Being thus terrified by the Law, the man ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
deſpaireth of his own ſtrength, he looks about, and ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for the help of a Mediator and Saviour. Here then
cometh in good time the healthful Word of the Goſpel, and ſaith,
Son, thy ſins are forgiven thee, believe in Jeſus Christ cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
for thy ſins.</hi> Theſe ſayings of <hi>Luther,</hi> Sir, do fully
aſſure me that <hi>Luther</hi> held a neceſſity of Legal ſorrow
and humiliation in perſons to be juſtified, and that to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
them for Juſtification, which is directly againſt the
ſecond Poſition of your former Sermons, concerning the
abſoluteneſſe of the Goſpel, wherein you pleaded what
you could, againſt the neceſſity of ſuch legal ſorrow, and
humiliation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But paſſe we over theſe, and conſult we</hi> Luther <hi>about
that neceſſary mean of faith; Let the Queſtion be, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the Goſpel faith be not required to the actual en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of Juſtification, and Remiſſion, and to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
of a right thereto, and intereſt therein? Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we may have a right to, and intereſt in, or actual
enjoyment of theſe benefits without faith, or before faith?
We wil not go beyond his Commentary on the Epiſtle to
the</hi> Galatians <hi>for the diſcovering of his mind herein; and
begin we where we left, Chap. 2. ver.</hi> 16. Here is to be
noted, that theſe three, Faith, Chriſt, and Acceptation, or
Imputation muſt be joyned together; Faith taketh hold on
Chriſt, and hath him preſent as a Ring doth a precious ſtone;
and whoſoever ſhall be found having this confidence in Chriſt
apprehended in the heart, him will God account for Righteous.
This is the mean, and this is the merit whereby we attain the
remiſſion of ſins and Righteouſneſſe. <hi>So on</hi> verſ. 20. <hi>of the
ſame Chapter, a place cited already, he teacheth that it is
through faith we are united to Chriſt, and come to call
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:167980:32"/>
the benefits we have by him, ours,</hi> Cap. 3. 13. <hi>about the
middle.</hi> For as much then as Christ reigns by his grace in
the hearts of the Faithful, there is no ſin, no death, nor curſe.
But where Chriſt is not knowne, there all theſe things do
ſtill remain; Therefore all they that believe not, do lack this
ineſtimable benefit, and glorious Victory. <hi>And on</hi> ver. 14. We
are all accurſed before God, before we know Chriſt; and there is
no other way to avoid the Curſe but to believe. <hi>A little after,</hi>
This gift of the Spirit, we receive not by any other Merits then
by faith alone: <hi>Ver.</hi> 26. Faith in Chriſt maketh us the children
of God. <hi>And</hi> Verſe 28. <hi>comparing our believing to the
looking on the braſen Serpent, ſaith thus,</hi> This is true
faith concerning Chriſt, and in Chriſt, whereby we are made
members of his body, fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone. In
him therefore we live, move, and have our being: Chriſt
and our faith muſt be throughly joyned together. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 29. If
ye be Chriſts, then are you Abrahams Seed; that is to ſay,
If ye believe, and be baptized into Chriſt; If ye believe I
ſay, &amp;c. then are ye the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> not by nature,
but by Adoption. <hi>Yea, in the place firſt cited, with which
we ſhall conclude this teſtimony,</hi> cha. 2. 16. Becauſe thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt
in me (ſaith the Lord) and thy faith layeth hold on
Christ, whom I have freely given unto thee, that he might be
thy Mediator and High Priest, therefore be thou justified and
righteous. Wherefore God doth accept or account us as righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
only for our faith in Chriſt. Becauſe we do apprehend
Chriſt by Faith, all our ſins now are no ſins; But where
Christ and faith bee not, there is no remiſſion or covering
of ſins, but meer Imputation of ſinne and Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
                  <p>I hope Sir, in thoſe places <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeaks plainly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to the purpoſe in hand, and doth ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
his belief in this particular to be, that faith is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to our juſtification, and that to the obtaining of it,
that it doth marry us to Chriſt, and ſo ſtate us in a right
unto his benefits, that till we have this faith, we are accur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
caitiffes, under death, wrath and condemnation, and
that before God, or in his ſight. Nay Sir, he doth ſay,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:167980:33"/>
that it is becauſe of our faith, and for our faith, and that
faith is the merit by which we have it; which though I
doubt not but may paſſe with a favourable conſtruction,
yet are higher titles of Honour then any of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
do give unto her in pleading for Conditions in the
Covenant.</p>
                  <p>Your next Author was <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> his Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
on the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> I have; where I meet
with that common place, <hi>De Juſtificatione,</hi> in it the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage

                     <hi>We deny that the Teſtament of God

                  </p>
                  <p>But firſt, I conceive, that <hi>Martyr</hi> here denies only a
condition of Works, or a Legal condition. Such legal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
<hi>Pighius</hi> did plead for. And that theſe are the
conditions which <hi>Martyr</hi> doth deny, his owne words in
the very ſame page do clearly expreſſe. For having in
the line next after the paſſage you quote out of him, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
that of the Apoſtle at large, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 15, 16, 17. hee
preſently from this Teſtimony drawes this inference, as an
Explication of his former negation of conditions in the
Teſtaments, <hi>Haec verba clariſſimè docent; Theſe words do
moſt clearly teach, that the Teſtament which God made with
Abraham, was pure and abſolute; et ſine ulla legali con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditione,
and without any legal condition.</hi> But that he ſhould
deny the condition of faith, or that faith was required to
Juſtification, that common place ſhewes not, but rather
the contrary; for about ſome leaves after, ſpeaking of

In Evangelio autem ſi promiſſionibus anne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctantur opera, ea non ſunt accipienda vel ut merita, vel ut cauſa illarum promiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onum: ſed ita ſtatuendum eſt, ut illa Dei dona quae promittuntur poſt opera ſequantur, cametſi non perfecta fuerint &amp; abſoluta ut à lege imperantur. <hi>P.</hi> 1026, 1027.</note> The Law is received by doing,
and moſt exact performing that
which is commanded: But the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
by a lively and efficacious aſſent
of faith. <hi>Moſes</hi> alſo <hi>Deut.</hi> 30. wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
concerning the Law, that hee
had ſet before the people life and

the Law be received and fulfilled, it
will bring eternal life with it: But
ſeeing we are ſhut out from this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
the merciful God hath provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
another word, to wit of faith;
which if by aſſenting to it, it be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
bringeth life along with it.
From this place it appeareth, that
the promiſes of the Law were given
from the ſuppoſition or condition of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:167980:34"/>
Works going before. But in the Goſpel, if works are annexed
to the Promiſes, they are not ſo to be underſtood, as either the
merit or cauſes of thoſe Promiſes. But we muſt thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That theſe gifts of God which are promiſed, follow af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the works, though they be not perfect and abſolute as they
are commanded in the Law. <hi>This place, (I hope) will
ſhew that</hi> Peter Martyr <hi>was only againſt the</hi> condition of
Works, <hi>and there too againſt their</hi> merit or efficiency; <hi>for
as for</hi> their preſence, <hi>he allowes that they are required in

not at all againſt it. Turne to one place more,</hi> Rom. 8. If

the Promiſes Evangelical have no
conditions annexed; but the Legal
Promiſes are never offered without
conditions; for as its ſaid, Honour
thy Father and thy mother, that thou
maiſt live long upon the earth. And if
ye be willing and obedient ye ſhall eat
the good of the Land. So we read al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
in the Goſpel, Forgive, and it ſhall
be forgiven; give, and it ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
&amp;c. Wherefore ſeeing this is
not the difference, we muſt ſeek out
ſome other. It appeareth therefore
to him that diligently conſidereth, that
the conditions of the Law might bee
cauſes of the obtainment of the rewards
promiſed: for if they had been perfect
and abſolute, as the Law required
them, they might be compared with the
rewards themſelves, and had alſo had
eſteem of merit; but ſeeing theſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be performed by men. God of his
mercy gave in their ſtead Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Promiſes, which although they
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:167980:34"/>
have conditions added, yet are offered
freely. Wherefore if thou joyne theſe
three things together, that the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical
rewards are promiſed freely,
that the conditions cannot be compared
unto, or equalized with them, that the Promiſes muſt be moſt
firme, and take away the account of merit, you may ſee where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
theſe differ from thoſe of the Law.</p>
                  <p>And thus I hope it is manifeſt, that they were conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of Works which <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> did deny; that he did
not deny them ſimply neither, but only as meritorious
and cauſal of the benefits promiſed; that he held faith
to be the Requiſite or the Condition of the Goſpel. So
that you muſt give me leave to take <hi>Martyr</hi> from you
too, and put him down with the forenamed Authors, for a
patron of our Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>3. Next unto <hi>Peter Martyr,</hi> you cite <hi>Olevian,</hi> but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

                  <p>If you pleaſe with ſecond thoughts (which are moſt

In reſpect of God, he properly

when he doth in our hearts by

of free reconciliation offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in the Goſpel, and beginneth
our renovation to eternal life,
doth daily carry it on, and at

of us who were dead in ſins and
treſpaſſes, the Covenant is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
when the Holy Ghoſt is

have a will and power to believe the Promiſe of free grace

is meerly of free Grace, and doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
on any condition of our owne
ſtrength, but on the free mercy of God
in Chriſt, apprehended by faith, which
himſelf doth beſtow; The offer or tender
of a double Promiſe in Chriſt, to wit, of
the remiſſion of ſins, and ſanctification,
and ſo the donation of Chriſt himſelf, is,
in reſpect of God, moſt free. The accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
on our part is alſo free, becauſe
it is the action of God in us, whereby
he doth ſeal the Promiſe to our hearts;
ſo that being acted by him, we do act; being by him made Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,
we do believe; and being quickned or created by Chriſt
unto good works, we do walk in them.</p>
                  <p>Thus far <hi>Olevian</hi> in that place: and who is there Sir,
of theſe whom you oppoſe, that doth not ſay the ſame
with him? So that your quoting of him is at leaſt to lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
purpoſe for your opinion: I might farther ſhew you,
that he in another place, repeating the ſame thing, adds,
<note n="ſ" place="margin">Pag. 211, 212 213, 216.</note> once and again, that <hi>God in giving faith to his Elect and

ſubſtantiam foederis, <hi>the whole ſubſtance of the Covenant.</hi>
So that the remiſſion of ſin promiſed in the Covenant is
not Antecedent but Conſequent to faith; which in effect
is as much for the conditionality of faith in reference to
the pardon of ſin, &amp; the ſalvation of ſouls, as is contended
for by thoſe whom you oppoſe; but I will not inſiſt on
that. I ſhal, for your and the Readers better informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

he ſaith 'tis a Promiſe without a Condition.<note n="u" place="margin">Notandum, hanc eſſe ſimplicem &amp; evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicam ſine ulla conditione promiſſionem.

any condition; for here God doth
exact nothing;</hi> (to wit, to be

that he doth promiſe faith it ſelfe,

                  <p>2. You may obſerve, That when he ſaith,
The Promiſe is made without any condition, his
meaning is, without any Condition in us <hi>Antecedaneous,</hi>
as a moving cauſe, inducing or inclining the Lord to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
into this Covenant, and to make this matrimonial
Contract: all the cauſe thereof the Lord finds in, of,
and from himſelf; in which regard he prevents us, not
we him. Thus he doth afterwards clearly expreſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.

                     <hi>By that word, I wil betroth

<hi>Zanchy,</hi> and what have you gained by him in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,

the ſame things? and when they aſſert Conditions, yet
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:167980:38"/>
deny them to be on our part antecedaneous, or any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
cauſes, acknowledging that all doth proceed from

that are meritorious, and that the Covenant it
ſelf, as alſo the Promiſes are free without reſpect unto,
or dependance on any thing that is of merit in us. Thus
in the very next page ſetting down the ſubſtantial or eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
heads of the Covenant, he delivereth his mind;
<note n="y" place="margin">Ratio foederis faciendi ſeu pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittendi, eſt, qua Deus ex gratia, extra noſtra merita foedus hoc nobiſcum init; foedeſque hoc nullis noſtris ſuffultum eſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritis. <hi>Pag. 44. §. 3. Ratio.</hi>

                     <hi>The manner of making the Covenant, or

they ſpeak the ſame thing with him in this particular?
Hitherto I ſhewed, that <hi>Zanchy</hi> is not ſo much for you, as
you would make the world believe he is; I ſhall now
make it appear, that in the ſame place, however he doth
not uſe the word <hi>Condition</hi> (which yet he doth in other
places) yet he ſpeaks the ſame thing for ſubſtance which
they do againſt whom you alledg him. And that there are
ſuch conditions required on the Churches part as wee

wil beſtow the Kingdom of Heaven on us for our inheritance;

                  <p>Now Sir, if you will be pleaſed to conſider theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
aſſertions of <hi>Zanchy,</hi> in this very place which you
your ſelf did quote, 1. Faith is that Grace which is on
the Churches part neceſſary to make up the marriage Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
between the Lord and her. 2. This grace the
Lord doth promiſe abſolutely to give, it being that grace
without which the reſt of the Promiſes have no place in
us. 3. It is alſo our duty; God doth in the Covenant
command it, we promiſe to perform it. 4. It is that
wherein, on our part, the ſubſtance of the Covenant doth
conſiſt. Lay them altogether, and you may clearly ſee
here is an acknowledgment of the thing, faith is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of the Covenant, though he doth not give it the
name. But to give you a further taſte of him, that it
may be out of all queſtion that he doth aſſert conditions,
both name and thing; I ſhall only intreat you to peruſe
<note n="a" place="margin">In 1. Epiſt. Joha. cap. 1. loc. de rem. peccat. q. 6.</note> one place more in him; where he doth largely handle
that great bleſſing and benefit of the Covenant, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:167980:39"/>
of ſins;<note place="margin">Quibus condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſio peccatorum offeratur &amp; conferatur.</note> in the ſixth place he comes to conſider, <hi>On
what condition it is offered and conferred;</hi> and mentions
three: 1. The firſt and chief, is the true and conſtant
practice of Repentance. 2. Confeſſion and acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of our offences to thoſe whom we have injured and
wronged. 3. A brotherly forgiving of thoſe which have
ſinned againſt and offended us. Where he doth withal
maintain, that<note n="b" place="margin">Sunt conditiones non propter quas, ſed citra quas peccatorum remiſsio non obtine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur.— Et ſi citra bas conditiones obtine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri remiſsio peccatorum non poteſt, non ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men propter eas tanquam propter merita. Ideo <hi>Johannes</hi> ait, Si confiteamur, ecce con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionem; non tamen ait, propter confeſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onem— Nam etiam citra fidem haberi non poteſt juſtificatio, non tamen propter dignitatem fidei haberi eam dicimus, ſed gratis. — Deinde illud notandum eſt, etiam has conditiones quas requieit à nobis Deus, donari nobis à Deo, &amp; eſſe dona Dei; non ergo meritis ullo modo, ſed ſoli Dei gratiae danda eſt remiſsio peccatorum.</note> 
                     <hi>they are condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
not for which, but without
which the remiſſion of ſins is not
obtained;</hi> denying them to be
conditions meritorious. <hi>There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
S.</hi> John <hi>ſaith, If we confeſs,
behold the condition; yet he doth
not ſay, for our confeſſion, he will
forgive. Juſtification cannot be
had without faith; but we do not
ſay, it is obtained for the worth of
our faith; but freely, or of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace.
Moreover this is</hi> (ſaith
he) <hi>to be noted, that even the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
conditions which God requireth
of us, are given to us by God: Therefore the remiſſion of
ſins is not to be aſcribed in any ſort to our Merits, but to the
grace of God alone.</hi> You have here <hi>Zanchy,</hi> ſpeaking as
fully and as plainly for Conditions, as any of thoſe whoſe
Doctrine you oppoſe, in which regard I muſt intreat you
either to quit your claim to this Author, and leave him to

                  <p>5 The Teſtimony of learned <hi>Junius</hi> is next produced

                     </gap>, oft

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:167980:39"/>
word <hi>Foedus,</hi> both according to the Etymology
and uſe thereof in claſſical Authors, are not reſtrained to
thoſe federal promiſes wherein there is a mutual ſtipulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
between divers parties expreſſed, but for ſuch declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and diſpoſitions as proceed from one alone, ſo that
the Hebrew word might well be rendred by the Apoſtle,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Now this is a thing which is not denied, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged
and granted by thoſe, which yet nevertheleſſe
do aſſert a mutual ſtipulation, and conditions (in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard)
in the Covenant of Grace. So that if this be the
ſcope and drift of that Oration, as it ſeems to be by his
mentioning of it for this end and purpoſe; it is alledged
by you to little purpoſe, ſeeing it doth neither make for
you, nor againſt us. In proſecution of this, which is the
main drift of that Parallel, and as I conceive by his own
citing of it, of the Oration alſo; he adds,<note n="d" place="margin">Dei gratiam luculentiorem homini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus explicatam eſſe, quòd ſuis non foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, ſed Teſtamentum dederit.

                     <hi>That the grace
of God is manifeſted much more clear
to men, in that he doth not give a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,

are his: For the Covenant would
have Conditions, which if either part
do not perform, the Covenant is made
void. But a Teſtament is an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of liberality and grace, without
any condition; by which men are called
and appointed heirs, without reſpect to
any duty which might proceed from
them.</hi> By this paſſage of <hi>Junius</hi> you may take notice,
who that <hi>Vir maximus</hi> is whom Dr. <hi>Ames</hi> cites, in that

7. <hi>Paſſe we on to Doctor</hi> Preſton, <hi>where againe you

betweene the Covenants, or rather between the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of the ſame Covenant;</hi> viz. <hi>the promiſe of Grace,
which he calleth an abſolute Covenant made with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,</hi>
Jer. 31. Ezek. 36. <hi>and the Promiſe of life which he
cals a conditional Covenant made with all,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark 16</note> If thou believe,
thou ſhalt be ſaved. <hi>You run away with a piece, and put
downe Dr.</hi> Preſton <hi>for a defender of the abſoluteneſſe of
the Covenant, though both there, and in his Treatiſe of
the Covenant (of which I believe you were not ignorant)
he writes many leaves to the contrary. But I hope you
will wipe this Author alſo out of your liſt, after I have
rehearſed ſome paſſages unto you out of him. Look then
either in that, or the Sermon foregoing (for I have not
the Book now by me) and you ſhall find Dr.</hi> Preſton <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting
faith to be required, and that precedently to our
being in Covenant: For thus he writes,</hi> That which is
required of them is only, that they take it. And there
is nothing precedently required or looked for on our parts, but
taking and applying of it. <hi>So page</hi> 18 The taking of Chriſt
makes Chriſt ours. — Faith is that whereby the right of
Chriſt is made ours unto ſalvation. <hi>Pag 62, 63 he tels us
of the</hi> reconciling and juſtifying act of faith; which, <hi>he
ſaith</hi> is direct, <hi>and is that</hi> whereby we take Chriſt; <hi>as well
as of</hi> its pacifying act, <hi>which he calls</hi> reflex, <hi>and ſaith it is
that</hi> whereby we know we take him: <hi>yea, he tells us, that</hi>
Humiliation is required, <hi>not as a qualification: but as
our ſenſe of ſickneſſe is required to our ſeeking of cure,
ſo this to our ſeeking of Chriſt, without which wee will
never come to Chriſt. And would you know what</hi> this
taking of Chriſt is, <hi>which he ſaith is precedently requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red?
He tells you toward the latter end of the firſt Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
that it is to</hi> know Chriſt rightly, as Prophet, Prieſt
and King.—To obey him.—To forſake all other for him. — To
pitch on him with our whole deliberate and ſincere will. <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over
after this our receipt of him,</hi> We are <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
to obey him, to be holy as he is holy, to forſake all;
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:167980:42"/>
                     <hi>which he calls</hi> after-clap conditions, <hi>and</hi> hard conditions.
<hi>And</hi> pag. 25. Thoſe that be humble and ſee Gods wrath what
it is, that have their conſciences awakened to ſee ſin, will
come in and be glad to have Chriſt, though on theſe conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
but the other will not. If you will have Chriſt on theſe
conditions, you may. But we preach in vain, all the world
refuſeth Chriſt, becauſe they will not leave their Covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
Pride, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all becauſe they be not humbled. <hi>Now
whereas he excludes conditions in ſome paſſages, he tells
you in what ſenſe he excludes them.</hi> Pag. 15. When we
exclude all conditions, we exclude ſuch a frame and habit of
mind, which we think is neceſſarily required to make us wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to take him. <hi>By which it appears clearly, they were
meritorious conditions he excluded. To theſe I may add
how in his Treatiſe of the New Covenant,</hi> page 217. <hi>he
gives this for his fourth Reaſon, why uprightneſſe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired;</hi>
viz. That there might be an integrity on both ſides;
A Covenant, as on Gods part, ſo on ours: That as he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
he will be all-ſufficient, ſo he requireth this again on our
parts, That we be altogether his. <hi>And pag</hi> 357. That the
Condition God required of <hi>Abraham</hi> was, that he ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve;
<hi>where he ſpends many leaves in ſhewing that, and
why faith is the condition of the New Covenant,</hi> Page
389. That Repentance, the condition required of us, is part
of the Covenant, both on Gods part and on ours. The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that is required of us, as part of the Covenant, is the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this, the action. But the ability whereby we are able
to perform theſe is a part of the Covenant on the Lords part.
<hi>Pag.</hi> 398. That when we do believe, at that very hour we
enter into Covenant, and are tranſlated from death to life:
<hi>And pag.</hi> 458. When the heart gives her full conſent, and
takes the Lord for her God and Governour, then is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
made up between them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe paſſages (Sir) abundantly ſatisfie me concerning
that holy and reverend Author, that he held faith to be
the grand condition of the Goſpel, precedently required
to, not only our knowing our ſelves in ſtate of Grace,
but our very being therein, and right thereto. If he ſay,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:167980:42"/>
that the Covenant, that is, one part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of Grace, is abſolute; he ſaith no more then others,
for I know none of our ſide that hold that part to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently
conditional. Some call it a <hi>Free,</hi> others an
<hi>Abſolute promiſe,</hi> others a <hi>Covenant with Chriſt for us,</hi> &amp;c.
Yea, in regard of the freeneſſe and abſoluteneſſe of it,
they grant the Covenant in reſpect of the Elect to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent
to an abſolute Promiſe, and the purchaſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent
to an abſolute purchaſe (as you may ſee <hi>Owen

is promiſed, being purchaſed and promiſed as well as
the ſalvation. Notable are the expreſſions of Mr. <hi>Ruther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi>
in this particular,<note n="k" place="margin">Survey of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinom. p. 129.</note> 
                     <hi>We teach faith a condition on our
part, and alſo a grace promiſed: Chriſt brings himſelfe,
his righteouſneſſe, and the condition of faith too, which doth
receive him. As if ſome Prince ſhould freely promiſe to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
ſome maid of low eſtate, on condition ſhe wear a gold chain,
with a rich Jewel of the Crown in it, and withal ſhould bind
himſelf to give her both the chain and a will to wear it.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain,
<hi>He is both without doors knocking, and within doors o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening,
yet he never cometh in, but upon condition we open,
which condition is alſo his own work. He offers Righteouſneſs
ſo the ſinner believe, and he works belief that the ſinner may
have Righteouſneſſe,</hi> pag. 109. Thus you ſee others as
well as Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> aſſert the abſoluteneſſe of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in that part; who yet ſtill maintain the other part,
<hi>viz.</hi> the promiſe of life and ſalvation to be conditional;
which as hath been already ſhewed, Dr. <hi>Preſton</hi> doth
maintain.</p>
                  <p>8. <hi>As for Mr.</hi>
                     <note n="l" place="margin">Socin. Diſc &amp; Conſut p. 225.</note> Walker, <hi>he denies not all kinds of

which are as</hi> a means by which the free gift is received,

There is no condition of the Covenant propounded, but only

I ſhall add ſome few more.</p>
                  <p>1 <hi>Mr.</hi> Perkins <hi>ſhall be the firſt, who puts down con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions

                     <hi>ſaith he elſewhere)</hi> muſt be
conſidered the ſubſtance thereof, and the condition. The Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Covenant is, that Righteouſneſſe and life everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
is given to Gods Church and people by Chriſt. The
Condition is, that we for our parts are by faith to receive the
foreſaid benefits, and this condition is by grace as well as the
ſubſtance.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Mr.</hi> Reynolds <hi>ſhall be the next; in his Treatiſe of
the</hi> Life of Chriſt, p. 399. <hi>he calls Faith the</hi> conveyance:
<hi>and p.</hi> 403. We expect Juſtification by faith in Chriſt.—
Faith unites us to Chriſt, and makes his death, merit, life,
kingdom, ſonſhip, victory, benefits to become ours. <hi>You
may ſee</hi> p. 451, 452, 453. That to marriage between Chriſt
and his Church, whereby the Church hath a right and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
created, to the Body, Name, Goods, Table, Poſſeſſion,
and Purchaſes of Chriſt,— is eſſentially required conſent,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:167980:43"/>
which conſent muſt be mutual; for though Chriſt declare his
good will when he knocketh at our doors, yet if we keep at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
ſtop our ears at his invitations, there is then no Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
made. It is but a wooing, and no marriage, <hi>&amp;c.
Pag.</hi> 465, 466, 467. That the office of Faith is to unite to
Chriſt, and give poſſeſſion of him, till which union by Faith
be made, we remain poor and miſerable, notwithſtanding the
fulneſs that is in Chriſt. <hi>Pag. 478, 479. and to name no
more,</hi> pag. 512. <hi>ſetting down the difference between the</hi>
two Covenants, <hi>he ſaith,</hi> They differ in the Conditions, for
in the old Covenant, legal obedience; but in the new Faith
only is required, and the certain conſequent thereof Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>Mr.</hi> Ball <hi>ſhall be the third, who ſaith,</hi>
                     <note n="o" place="margin">Treat. of the N. Cov. p. 17.</note> The Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Grace doth not exclude all conditions, but ſuch as
will not ſtand with grace: <hi>and pag.</hi> 18. The ſtipulation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
is, that we take God to be our God; that is, that wee
repent of our ſins, believe the Promiſes of mercy, and embrace
them with the whole heart, and yeild love, fear, reverence,
worſhip, and obedience to him according to the preſcript rule
of his Word: <hi>and p.</hi> 20. If then we ſpeak of Conditions, by
conditions we underſtand whatſoever is required on our part,
as precedent, concomitant, or ſubſequent to Juſtification. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
Faith and Obedience, are all conditions. But if
by conditions we underſtand what is required on our part, as
the cauſe of that God promiſed, though only inſtrumental,
Faith or belief in the Promiſes of free mercy is the only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
                  <p>4. <hi>Let learned</hi> Pemble <hi>be the fourth, who ſpeaking
of the difference between the Law and the Goſpel, ſaith,</hi>
                     <note n="p" place="margin">Of Juſtif. §. 4. c. 1.</note> The diverſity is this, The Law offers life unto man upon
condition of perfect obedience, curſing the tranſgreſſors there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in the leaſt kind with eternal death. The Goſpel offers
life unto man upon another condition, <hi>viz.</hi> Repentance and
Faith in Chriſt, promiſing remiſſion of ſin to ſuch as repent
and believe. That this is the main eſſential difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Covenant of Works and the Covenant of Grace,
we ſhall endeavor to make good againſt the Romiſh Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy.
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:167980:44"/>
                     <hi>And about a leaf after,</hi> Hence we conclude firmly,
that the difference between the Law and the Goſpel aſſigned
by our Divines, is moſt certain and agreeable to the Scriptures,
viz. That the Law gives life unto the Juſt upon condition of
perfect obedience in all things: The Goſpel gives life unto
ſinners, upon condition they repent and believe in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus.
<hi>Where you may take notice, that he layes it down
not as his own private opinion, but as the general Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
of all the Orthodox Divines in his time, and that
in oppoſition to our Popiſh Adverſaries. It was then
no Popery to hold conditions in the Covenant: and as

that is, the Law and the Goſpel, whereof the one is the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Works, the other is the Covenant of Grace, do teach
that the Law of Works is that which to Juſtification requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
Works as the condition thereof. The Law of Faith, that
which to Juſtification requireth faith as the condition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
The former ſaith, Do this and thou ſhalt live; the latter,
Believe in Chriſt and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>6. Doctor <hi>Davenant</hi> doth alſo fully expreſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe
ſeveral times to the like purpoſe, and may in
the ſixth place be added to the former. His words
are theſe:</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="r" place="margin">In fodere Evangelico aliter ſe res habet; nam in hoc foedere ad obtinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam reconciliationem, juſtificationem &amp; vitam aeternam, non alia requiritur conditio quam verae &amp; vivae fidei: Sic Deus dilexit mundum. <hi>Joh. 3. 16. Rom. 4. 5. Gal.</hi> 3. 8. Juſtificatio igitur &amp; jus ad vitam aeternam ex conditione ſolius fidei ſuſpenditur. <hi>De juſt. act. c. 30. in reſp. ad ob.</hi> 3.</note> In the Covenant of the Goſpel it is
otherwiſe; for in this Covenant, to the
obtainment of reconciliation, Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and life eternal, there is no other
condition required then of true and
lively faith; God ſo loved the world,
<hi>John</hi> 3. 16. Therefore Juſtification,
and the right to eternal life doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:167980:44"/>
on the condition of faith alone. <hi>Where he doth after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
thus briefly ſhew the difference betweene the Law
and the Goſpel, conſidered as two diſtinct Covenants;</hi>
                     <note n="ſ" place="margin">Lex in conditione operum habet ipſam vim &amp; formam icti foederis: At E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelium in Mediatoris ſanguine fide apprehenſo collocat ipſam vim &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam foederis. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                     </note> The Law <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> hath the very
ſtrength and form of a Covenant made
in the condition of Works. But the
Goſpel placeth the very ſtrength and

<hi>What can be ſaid more expreſly then this? I will not
trouble you with repeating what hath been already deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
out of him in his next Chapter, but only mention
one paſſage or two out of him:</hi>

from Chriſt in manner following. 1 Chriſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
his Miniſters, as Legats, with the word of reconciliation
or pardon, inviting them to believe on him, that they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
forgiveneſſe of ſins. 2. He doth work together by his
Spirit, making thoſe who are his children, believe on him, if
they may find forgiveneſſe in him. 3 He doth communicate
to them the forgiveneſſe which himſelfe had procured and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
for them. <hi>And on that fourth verſe,</hi> God doth not
bind any directly and immediately to believe ſalvation but in
a certain order, for he binds them firſt to believe on Chriſt to
Salvation, and then brings them in Chriſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that hee loved them, and gave himſelfe for
them.</p>

there, and were condemned by an <hi>Aſſembly at the Church

Err. 27. It is incompatible to the Covenant of Grace to joyne
Faith thereunto.</hi> Err. 28. <hi>To affirm there muſt be faith on
mans part to receive the Covenant, is to undermine Chriſt.</hi> Er.
37. <hi>We are completely united to Chriſt, before, or without

or a condition expreſſed,</hi> Err. 82. Where faith is
held forth by the Miniſters as the condition of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
of Grace on mans part, as Juſtification by San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification,
and the acting of faith, in that Church there
is not ſufficiency of bread. By condemning theſe opinions
for Errors, they declare their judgments to be for condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in the Covenant.</p>
                  <p>You ſee (Sir) with what a cloud of witneſſes we are
compaſſed, and how the ſtream of Proteſtant and true
Religion hath run in this channel: certainly, it ſhould
be ſome more then ordinary cauſe that ſhould make us
run counter to ſo many grave, learned, and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Authors. Well, let us ſee what moves you to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
Firſt, Many of them confeſſe it to be conditions
improperly. Secondly, Many are driven to eat their
own words. Now if both theſe were true, would they
be of moment to make you diſſent from your godly bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?
Is propriety of ſpeech ſuch a Jewel, that
for the preſervation of it the good names of the godly
and orthodox Divines, and the peace of the Church
muſt be ſaid to ſtake? But who (my good friend) ſhall
be judge of this propriety? Certainly, if it ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
for language that was in the Doctors time, you will
be caſt;<note place="margin">Penes quos eſt vis <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

                  <p>I remember when I had ſome conference with you in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:167980:46"/>
your Committee houſe about your Sermon, you told me,
<hi>Pemble</hi> was for you, and <hi>Chamier</hi> for you, and all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemick
Writers were for you: and now the contrary
proves true, and they are brought againſt you, now
they ſpeak improperly, and are ſometimes forc'd to
eat their words. I am ſure you ſpeak not properly
when you told me that they balked the word Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>But proceed we to the other Grounds. You go on
and tell us, that another thing that cauſeth your diſtance
was, the vigilancy of the Adverſary, who was ready to
make uſe of ſuch expreſſions for defence of their Tenents.
This I confeſſe is of more weight then the former, for we
ſhould be careful that we miniſter not the leaſt advantage
to the Adverſary. Biſhop <hi>Davenant,</hi> as hath been heard al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
would not have us in conference with Papiſts, uſe
ſuch ſpeeches as theſe, That Works are neceſſary, and
the like, becauſe they will be apt to underſtand merit by
them: yet nevertheleſſe that reverend Author doth uſe
the word Condition, and very frequently: it ſeems he
thought there was no ſuch peril in the uſe of it. Again,
the adverſaries you ſpeak of, muſt be either Papiſts or
Arminians. Now as for Papiſts, you have delivered us
from all fear that way, by telling us they ſtand not for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
merit in the preparations they plead for; now if they
took any advantage from the word Condition, it would
be to approve of merit. As for Armininas, they may
take as much advantage from all Commands, Calls, and
Counſels to Faith and Repentance to prove their free
will, as from conditions: So then theſe alſo muſt be laid
aſide. Beſides, if there were danger in the expreſſion,
can it not be qualified, ſo as that neither Papiſts nor Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians
may take any ground therefrom for the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their Errors? muſt it needs be wholly caſt away?
Moreover, is there not as great a care to be had of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians
and Libertines, with whom our Engliſh Church
begins to be peſtred? and may not theſe ſpiders in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
their venome on your own gay flowers of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:167980:47"/>
freeneſſe, to the poyſoning of the power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
both in their own and other mens converſations?
May they not ſay, Seeing no conditions are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
nothing on our part is to be done, I may live as I
liſt, for I cannot break the Covenant?</p>
                  <p>Sir, This is an inference not onely may be made, but
hath been made by too many in theſe looſe times. I have
heard ſad ſtories of it whilſt I lived in <hi>London;</hi> I have
knowne the perſons there that have caſt off Sabbaths,
Duties, Ordinances, with this inference: and ſcoft
at the followers of them; calling them, <hi>Duty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers,
Men of an Old Teſtament ſpirit,</hi> and the
like.</p>
                  <p>You cannot be ignorant that ſuch a horrid inference
is practically made from that Doctrine: And however
you may think you have a ſalve for it in your thoughts
(which how ſollid it may be I much queſtion) yet how can
you remedy it in the hearts and lives of others? Oh do
not deſtroy by one Sermon more then you can build by
ten.</p>
                  <p>But laſt of all, that that moſt moveth you is your compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to vulgar hearers, who hearing of conditions, take not
hold on the Promiſe becauſe they have not the condition.
Now here, in the bowels of this compaſſion, I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you to conſider what you do, and tell me ſeriouſly,
Dare you bid a ſinner, whilſt he goes on impenitently in
his evil way, never repenting of it, nor turning from it,
nor looking after Chriſt; dare you (I ſay) offer ſuch a
wretch the precious blood of our bleſſed Saviour? And
dare you bid ſuch a one, continuing ſuch, to lay hold on
the promiſe of mercy? Dare you tell him, That the
Goſpel belongs unto him even while he is ſuch? Dare
you ſay, Here Drunkard, Swearer, Whore maſter, here
is ſalvation for thee, here is a Chriſt for thee, here is
life for thee, though thou go on in thy ſwearing, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
whoring; Salvation is thine, take it, aſſure thy
ſelf of it, it is thine? If you do, fare you well. I dare not,
leſt I ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked; Old and New
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:167980:47"/>
Teſtament are both againſt it. But if your meaning be,
that ſuch a ſinner ſhould alter his mind, leave his courſe,
repent him of his evil way, give up himſelf wholly to
Chriſt, and then, though never ſo foul, here was water
to cleanſe him, and bloud to purge him, mercy to
pardon him, and a Chriſt to juſtifie him. If your mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(I ſay) be this, what do you but hold out mercy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional,
even as we do, and to what end have you raiſed
all this duſt and ſtir?</p>
                  <p>To conclude, The peace of the Church, and edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſouls ſhould be moſt dear unto us; things wee
ſhould both preach and pray, ſtudy and labour for, and
by all means poſſible endeavour to procure, preſerve,
and propagate. Now I do beſeech you (my dear bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
ſeriouſly and ſadly to conſider, whether your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Tenent, and the broaching of it, doth not make a
diſturbance in the one, and a ſtop and hinderance in the
other? My heart akes to think of the late ſtirs in the
<hi>New England</hi> Churches, occaſioned by Maſter <hi>Wheel-write,</hi>
Maſter <hi>Hutchiſon,</hi> and their followers, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
when I conſider, that this very Tenent, <hi>No Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
in the Covenant,</hi> had a great influence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
if it were not the maine cauſe thereof. For here
began they to look upon all thoſe faithful Miniſters of
Chriſt, who maintained conditions, as no Preachers
of free Grace, no Goſpel Miniſters, Legal Teachers,
not yet acquainted with the Goſpel Covenant, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to give ſufficient bread to their people, as appears
by the examinations of Maſter <hi>Hutchiſon,</hi> and others in
the book fore mentioned. Thereupon they fell to a
neglect of their Sermons, contempt of the publick Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,
ſiding and faction, till in the end, for troubling
of the Church her peace, they were ſome of the chief of
them cut off and baniſhed. May not (my dear brother)
the like uſe be made of your preſent Doctrine? Yea, is
it not (think you) already made by divers? Are not the
hearts of many taken off thereby from their faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
and Paſtors whom before they loved, prized,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:167980:48"/>
hearkened to, received good from, yea haply received
their converſion by (if they be indeed converted?) are
not (I ſay) their hearts taken off from theſe their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
Fathers, ſo that they neglect their Sermons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
their counſels, call them, nick-name them Legal
Teachers, and Miniſters of the Old Teſtament? when
yet I hope you your ſelfe cannot in your conſcience but
acknowledg them for the true Ambaſſadors of the Lord
Jeſus. May not this ill iſſue of your Doctrine lye heavy
on your ſpirits? Again, may not the Writings of
<hi>Pemble, Preſton, Perkins,</hi> and other our Worthies
now with God, for their holding of Conditions, and
profeſſing the conditions of Faith and Repentance, as
without which we cannot have life, be laid aſide and
neglected? Nay, are not theſe Authors themſelves
contemned as men of darker times, and not acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with ſuch cleare light as now ſhineth, though
you know there is more of the power and marrow of
Chriſtianity in one of their pages then in ten leaves
of your new lighted Meteors? Beſide, are not many
of the godly who love you, and were hearers of you,
driven from your Lectures, or at leaſt cannot come
to them without fear and jealouſie? others thereby
amazed, not knowing whom to follow? and moſt
called away from the practice of Religion, to that
needleſſe diſquiſition of a curious ſpeculation? When
he builders claſh, the Building muſt needs be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted;
and when the Witneſſes diſagree, the Jurors
can bring in little better then an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> in their
Bill.</p>
                  <p>I do beſeech you (Sir) to conſider how by this
your Tenent the names and Doctrine of Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Miniſters, dead and living, are aſperſed, the
minds of the godly troubled, the peace of the Church
diſquieted, the hands of the wicked ſtrengthened,
the mouthes of the Adverſaryes opened, and the
hearts of your friends exceedingly ſadded;<note n="*" place="margin">This Book was delivered unto <hi>Mr. Eyre</hi> in the Authors life time, ſome years ſince, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Book againſt <hi>Mr. Woodbridge, Mr. Crauford,</hi> and <hi>Mr. Baxter</hi> came forth.</note> and to draw

of our preſent meeting, there is
no need that I ſpeak unto you,
ſeeing it is, or may be knowne
unto you all, that we have at this
time accompanied, though
not a very aged, yet an able,
faithful,<note place="margin">Job 30. 23.</note> painful, and godly Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt
unto his grave, that houſe prepared for all the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
where, as to his body, he is to reſt until that
great day,<note place="margin">John 5. 28, 29</note> 
                     <hi>when all that are in their graves, ſhall
hear the voice of the Son of God, and ſhall come forth,
they that have done good to the Reſurrection of life,
they that have done evil to the Reſurrection of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
at what time the faithful Miniſters of Jeſus
Chriſt, how much ſoever contemned, cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and cloathed with reproach in this world,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 2, 3, 4</note>
                     <hi>who have fed the ſtock of God, taking the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſight
thereof not by conſtraint, but willingly, not for
filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being
Lords over Gods heritage, but being example: to the
flock, when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, they alſo
ſhall receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away.</hi>
Yea, they ſhall then, together with all other Gods
ſervants, enter in all fulneſſe into the joy of their
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:167980:51"/>
Lord, and be poſſeſſed of an inheritance incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and undefiled, that fadeth not away, reſerved in
heaven for them.</p>
                  <p>The Holy Ghoſt tels us in <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 11. That <hi>a good
name is better then precious ointment;</hi> with that rich
Embalming is our dear Brother gone unto his grave,
which will make his memory ſweet and precious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to all that knew him, and love God. And
of ſuch a one, who is buryed with this ſweet Odour
the Holy Ghoſt witneſſeth in the end of that verſe,
That <hi>the day of death is better then the day of birth.</hi>
The day of Birth brings every one to an afflicted
dying life, but the day of death bringeth every ſuch
one, yea every child of God to an everlaſting life
of never dying glory.</p>
                  <p>Whether you that are the Inhabitants of this
place were ſenſible of your bleſſing in the enjoying
the Miniſtry of this our deceaſed Brother, or are
apprehenſive of your loſſe in his departure from you,
I cannot ſay, (for you are all ſtrangers unto me;)
but this I am ſure of concerning very many, who
have occaſionally enjoyed the fruit of his Labours,
that they ſadly bewail the removing of one ſo furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
with skil and will to declare the truth of God,
and to oppoſe the old Superſtitious, and new, or
rather renewed Errors which on the right, and
left hand do oppoſe the Progreſs of a bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
amongſt us.</p>
                  <p>And upon this Account my heart greatly
mourneth over this brother of ours whom God
hath taken away from us, by whoſe death a
great breach is made amongſt us of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:167980:51"/>
in theſe parts at this time, wherein open
profaneneſſe and pernicious Errours do ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound.</p>
                  <p>When wee conſider our Brothers Miniſterial
Qualifications and Graces, his Ability and Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
embracing and beautifying each other; his
conſcionable and Chriſtian circumſpection over
himſelfe and his Doctrine, it is very doubtful whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he were more ripe for life, or fit for death:
Queſtionleſſe this our Brother after he had notice
of deaths approach towards him, could not but be
ſenſible of the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> ſtrait, between a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
of living to do good to others, and dying to
receive good for himſelfe; of ſerving the Lord
Chriſt in life,<note place="margin">Phil. 1. 23</note> and poſſeſſing the Lord Chriſt more
fully in death: yet I am confident, that in this
caſe he did proſtrate himſelf obedientially at the
feet of the will of God. And ſeeing the Lord hath
now declared his purpoſe to make this our dear Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
gain our loſſe, we muſt likewiſe ſubmit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
murmuring and repining, and ſay, The will of
the Lord be done. But though we are thus to qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
our ſelves in the will of God, and to part with
our Brother in all humble ſubmiſsion thereunto,
yet are we not to part with him without ſenſe of,
and ſorrow for ours and the Churches damage
in his removal from us. Indeed, there is no cauſe
why we ſhould mourn as men without hope of,
and comfort in the bleſſedneſſe of this our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who now ſleeps in Chriſt, and enjoyeth his
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:167980:52"/>
preſence, yet there is cauſe and warrant too to
mourne as Chriſtians, that ſo precious an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of good in the Church of God is taken from
us.</p>
                  <p>And that it may appear that wee have Scripture
warrant for ſuch our mourning at this time, I
ſhall ſpeak ſomething through Gods ſtrength, from
a Scripture which upon this ſad occaſion the
Lord hath guided my Meditations unto, which
we find in <hi>Acts</hi> 20. 37, 38.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Heſe words are a Hiſtory of the mournful
parting of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> and the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> together
with many other faithful Brethren, when
<hi>Paul</hi> took his final farewel of them, and
left them hopeleſſe of ever ſeeing his face again.</p>
                     <p>I will not hold you long in the Entry to my Text: We
may take notice that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> preached the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
for the ſpace of two years in <hi>Epheſus,</hi> with much
diligence and happy ſucceſſe, till he was by the violence
of furious enemies driven out thence, as we have it at
large related in <hi>chap.</hi> 19. And being to depart from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi>
he called unto him the Diſciples, and confirmed
their hearts in the truth which they had received, and
embracing them, departed from them, as appeares in
<hi>ver.</hi> 1. of this twentieth Chapter. After this having bin
in <hi>Macedonia,</hi> and made his abode in <hi>Greece</hi> for three
months, he reſolved upon a ſpeedy Journey to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
and made haſte thitherward by the way of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that
if it were poſſible he might be there on the Day of Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:167980:53"/>
which was then at hand, <hi>ver.</hi> 16, In proſecution
of which reſolution, he came to <hi>Miletus,</hi> and from thence
ſent to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and called the Elders of the Church that
he might ſpeak with them, and encourage them in that
great work that God had called them unto, <hi>ver.</hi> 17. And
when they were come, the Apoſtle, not in a way of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
oſtentation, but that he might be looked upon as a
leading Preſident to other Meſſengers of the Goſpel, ſet
forth his owne diligence and fidelity in preaching the
Word of God, <hi>ver.</hi> 18, 19, 20, 21. And <hi>ver.</hi> 22, 23, 24. he
ſhewed that God had acquainted him with many afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which would befal him for the future in the diſcharge
of his duty, all which he made very light of in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to the joyous accompliſhment of his courſe and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry
received from the Lord Jeſus. After this the Apoſtle
told the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that he knew that this preſent parting
would be his final parting with them in the fleſh, <hi>ver.</hi> 25.
and thereupon he appealed to their conſciences concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
his diligent, full, and faithful diſpenſing of the Word
and Counſel of God amongſt them for the effecting what
in him was, the ſalvation of all, <hi>ver.</hi> 26, 27. then from
<hi>ver.</hi> 28. to the end of <hi>ver.</hi> 31. there is a very ſolemn charge
given by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> to the Elders of <hi>Epheſus</hi> to
look to themſelves, and to the dear bought flock of God,
over which the Holy Ghoſt had made them Overſeers, to
feed them with the Word of Truth, and defend them,
what they might, from thoſe Wolviſh Seducers, who
riſing up amongſt them, ſhould make purlyes, and ſeek
to engroſſe and draw away Diſciples after them, ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbing,
and what in them lay, deſtroying the Peace and
Unity of the Church of God. Having finiſhed this
charge, the Apoſtle commended them to God and the
Word of his Grace for their farther edification to eternal
life, <hi>ver.</hi> 32. And then proteſting his freedom from the
ſin of Covetouſneſſe, and withal his known endeavour to
avoid the very appearance of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 33, 34, 35. he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
all that he ſpake unto them with prayer, <hi>ver.</hi> 36.
and when prayer was ended, the Apoſtle and the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>
                        <pb n="105" facs="tcp:167980:53"/>
in a moſt affectionate mournful manner parted each
from other, as the words of my Text give us a relation
thereof, <hi>And they all wept ſore, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In theſe words we are to conſider,</p>
                     <p>1. The occaſion of that ſad mourning of the Elders of
<hi>Epheſus,</hi> and other Believers mentioned in the Text; <hi>ſcil.</hi>
the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> final departing from them, according
as he told them, that <hi>they ſhould ſee his face no more.</hi> But
theſe words of the Apoſtle muſt be underſtood with a due
reſtriction or limitation to this preſent world. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
did not at all doubt whether this ſhould be a final
parting between him and his believing Converts of <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi>
for ever; he knew well there ſhould be a happy time
of meeting for them again, as we may be aſſured from his
own words to the <hi>Theſſalonians.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 2. 19, 20</note> 
                        <hi>For what is our hope, or
joy, or crown of rejoycing? Are not even ye in the preſence
of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his coming? For ye are our glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
and our joy.</hi> Theſe words of the Apoſtle inform us, that
he knew that no earthly parting ſhould be abſolutely a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
parting betwixt him and other Believers, when as he
looked beyond this world to the coming of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus;
but in reſpect of his perſonal preſence with the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi>
to counſel, inſtruct, and comfort them, as he had
done in the wayes of God, ſo the Apoſtle told them, that
<hi>they ſhould ſee his face no more,</hi> and when they were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
thereof, <hi>they wept.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. The deſcription of the mourning of the Elders of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi>
and other believers at their parting from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle;
which is laid down in three particulars.</p>
                     <p>1. The greatneſſe of it, <hi>They wept ſore.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>2. The generality of it, they were not ſome weak
hearted ones alone who were the mourners at this
parting, but this was a great univerſal mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of all that were preſent, <hi>They all wept ſore.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. The pathetick expreſſions of affection which the
believing <hi>Epheſians</hi> uſed towards the Apoſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> in this mourning, at their parting from him,
<hi>They fell on his neck and kiſſed him;</hi> and went as
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:167980:54"/>
far as poſſibly they could with him, till earth and
ſea neceſſitated their parting, <hi>They accompanied him
to the Ship.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I purpoſe at this time to gather up the ſum of all theſe
Particulars, and give it unto you in one Doctrinal Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,
eaſily ariſing from the words of the Text;
<hi>viz</hi> That</p>
                     <p>A faithful Miniſter of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed
with much love,<note place="margin">Doctr.</note> and finally parted from with much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
by thoſe who truly believe the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>The ſorrow here recorded of the Elders of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and
other Believers for the final parting of the Apoſtle from
them, was not under any other notion, but as he was a
faithful Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt unto them, ſo they loved
him whilſt they enjoyed him, ſo they mourned over him
when he was going from them. Miniſterial faithfulneſſe
admitteth of degrees in thoſe in whom it is in truth. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Miniſters of the Goſpel in our dayes ſuch as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the meaſure of the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> faithfulneſſe, are,
I ſay not rarely, but (as I conceive) not at all to be found.
How beit, I doubt not but that through Gods grace there
are ſome Miniſters of the Goſpel in our dayes, the deſire
of whoſe ſoul is, that they may be faithful, and who do
actually attain to ſome degrees of faithfulneſſe in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry
which they have received from the Lord Jeſus, and
ſhall therefore be inabled to give up the account of their
Stewardſhip with comfort and approbation, to him
their great Lord at his appearing and Kingdom.</p>
                     <p>I intend through Gods aſſiſtance, in order to the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Doctrine now before us, in the firſt place to
diſcover when a man may be a faithful Miniſter of Jeſus
Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>A man may be ſaid to be a faithful Miniſter of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt,</p>
                     <p>1 Firſt, When being called, and ſet apart to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
of God, as the Apoſtle was <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 1. he looks to, and
minds the diſcharge of the duty of the Miniſtry, as the
great work incumbent on him, in relation to Gods glory,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:167980:54"/>
and the good of his people. It is fit they ſhould turne
Farmers, Merchants, State-Counſellors, any thing rather
then Miniſters of the Goſpel, who make it their chief aim
and work to get Manors, Moneys, or the Advancement
of this preſent world. Whoſoever they be that mind
their corporal dues more, or as much as they do their
Spiritual Duties, who look carefully after the reward, and
careleſly after the Work of the Miniſtry, ſhall never be
acknowledged by the Lord in the number of the faithful
Miniſters of the Goſpel. They who account their
Miniſterial being to conſiſt in their Miniſterial Duties,<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. 1 Tim 4. 15</note> and
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> diſcharge of them, and accordingly preſſe after the
ſame, though they trade but with one talent, and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
bring not in viſibly much advantage to their Lord,
may yet expect to be accepted as faithful Miniſters of the
Goſpel, and to hear at laſt from their Lord that ſweet
voice, <hi>Well done, good and faithful ſervant, thou haſt been
faithful over a few things, I will make thee Ruler over ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord,</hi> Matth.
25. 23.</p>
                     <p>2. Secondly, When a man applyeth himſelf to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing
of the whole, and of the pure Word of God to
thoſe among whom he laboureth in the Lord. He is an
unfaithful Steward who with-holdeth any part of that
from the Houſhold which was committed to him for their
good, and he cannot have the eſteem of a faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
of the Goſpel, who wittingly keeps back any porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that good Word and Counſel of God, which hee
hath received from the Lord, to impart to others for the
making of them wiſe unto ſalvation. The Apoſtle appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the knowledge and conſcience of the Elders of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus,</hi>
that he <hi>had kept back nothing which was profitable
to them,</hi> ver. 20. and that he was pure from the blood
of all men, in that <hi>he had not ſhunned to declare unto them
the whole counſel of God,</hi> ver. 26, 27. It is certain that all
Miniſters of the Goſpel do not arrive at the ſame height
of knowledge in the Myſteries of the Goſpel, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of God; howbeit every Miniſter of the Goſpel is to
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:167980:55"/>
look and enquire diligently into the Scriptures after the
Myſteries of the Goſpel and mind of God, and as he
hath received, ſo he is to adminiſter the good Word of
God to others, without imbezeling or concealing any
part of it; which whilſt he makes conſcience, and is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to do according to his meaſure, how ſmal ſoever, his
Miniſterial Fidelity in this regard is to be acknowledged,
and he ſhall be accepted according to what he hath, and
not according to what he hath not. And as a faithful
Miniſter is careful to diſpenſe the whole, ſo likewiſe the
pure Word of God, not allaying and attempering the
ſame by carnal mixtures unto the Luſts and likings of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
men. The Lords charge in this kind is full of divine
Majeſty. <hi>Jer. 23 28, 29. The Prophet that hath a Dream,
let him tell a Dream, and he that hath my Word, let him
ſpeak my Word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat,
ſaith the Lord? Is not my Word like to a fire, ſaith the Lord,
and like a hammer that beateth the rock in pieces?</hi> And herein
the Apoſtle with much joy teſtified his own, and the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deity
of his fellow Laborers in the Goſpel, profeſſing
that <hi>they were not as many which corrupt the Word of God, but
as of ſincerity, as of God, in the ſight of God, ſpake they in
Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 2. 17.</p>
                     <p>3. Thirdly, A faithful Miniſter of the Goſpel is one
that takes care rightly to divide the Word of Truth, and
give every one in Gods family that portion of the Word
which belongeth unto him. At this branch of Miniſterial fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
the Apoſtle pointed in that charge, which with ſo
much ſeriouſneſſe and ſolemnity he gave to <hi>Timothy, I
charge thee before God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 4. 1, 22</note> 
                        <hi>who ſhal judg
the quick and dead at his appearing, and his Kingdom: Preach
the Word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon, reprove, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke,
exhort with all long ſuffering and Doctrine.</hi> Gods
faithful Meſſengers are careful to diſpenſe inſtruction to
the ignorant, comfort to the feeble minded, terror to
the obſtinate: <hi>On ſome to have compaſſion, others ſave with
fear,</hi>

by the Lord in his ſervants, as appeareth evidently from
our Saviours words,<note place="margin">Luke 12. 42, 43</note> 
                        <hi>Who then is that faithful and wiſe
Steward, whom the Lord ſhall make Ruler over his houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold,
to give them their portion of meat in due ſeaſon? Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
is that ſervant whom the Lord when he cometh ſhall find
ſo doing.</hi> This fidelity the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> again and again
called <hi>Timothy</hi> unto: that commanding counſel cannot
be overlooked in this kind,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 15</note> 
                        <hi>Study to ſhew thy ſelf approved
to God, a workman that needeth not to be aſhamed, rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding
the Word of Truth.</hi> And doubtleſs, every faithful
Miniſter hath it upon his conſcience, and in his care and
earneſt deſire, according to the degree of wiſdom recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
from God, to diſpenſe the Word of God in ſuch
wiſe, that every one may have a ſeaſonable and ſutable
portion of the ſame, as ſhall be neceſſary for the
bringing him in, or building him up, to receive an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
amongſt thoſe that are ſanctified by faith in
Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>4. Fourthly, As a faithful Miniſter of the Goſpel is
careful to preach, ſo likewiſe to pray for the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
whom God hath ſet him. A Preacher that ſpeaks
not oftner to God for, then from God to his people, may
partingly ſhake hands, but cannot partakingly joyn hands
with the faithful Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt as belonging to
their number. The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> witneſſed his fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
towards the people in praying to the Lord for them,
<hi>Remember how I ſtood before thee to ſpeak good for them, and
to turne away thy wrath from them.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Jer. 19. 20</note> This is much of the
cloſe and cloſet-work of the faithful Miniſters of Jeſus
Chriſt. Very many there are now adayes, who think
ſleightly of the Miniſters of the Goſpel and their work,
ſuppoſing that they have little to do, and might well be
ſpared. But did ſuch perſons know what is done in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
by the faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, how they ply the
Lord with prayers for the people, that he would divert
his judgments from them, continue and bleſſe his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
unto them, ſubdue their ſins, increaſe their gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
comfort their hearts, and ſave their ſouls, they
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:167980:56"/>
could hardly retain ſuch thoughts, or utter ſuch words
as they do concerning the deſpiſed ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt.
But how ever they are eſteemed, or diſ-eſteemed by men,
it is knowne to the Lord, and that is enough, that a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Miniſter is an importunate ſuter unto him in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half
of his people, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> aſſured the <hi>Philip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians</hi>
he was in reſpect of them. <hi>I thank my God upon
every remembrance of you, alwayes in every prayer of
mine for you all, making requeſt with joy,</hi> Philip. 1.
3, 4.</p>
                     <p>5. Fifthly, A faithful Miniſter of the Goſpel is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplifie
what he teacheth others in the courſe of his owne
life. A wicked well ſpeaking Miniſter, ſhall never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
approbation for fidelity from the Lord Jeſus. Though
a mans words be celeſtial as of an Angel of Heaven, yet
if his Converſation be low, loathſome and corrupt, <hi>his
prophecying in Chriſts name,</hi> will not prevail with the Lord
Chriſt in the day of Judgment, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o own and acknowledg
him for one of his faithful ſervants, but he ſhall then bee
found amongſt thoſe wretches to whom our Saviour will
utter that dreadful voice,<note place="margin">Matth. 7. 23</note> 
                        <hi>I never knew you, depart from
me ye that work iniquity.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> exhorted <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy,</hi>
and in him all Miniſters of the Goſpel, who deſire
to be found faithful, to look to it that they be an <hi>example
of Believers in Word,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4. 12</note> 
                        <hi>in Converſation, in Spirit, in Faith,
in Purity.</hi> He multiplyed words, as we ſee, that <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi>
and every faithful Miniſter of the Goſpel might ſee a
neceſſity laid upon him, to make it his great aim and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to walk exemplarily and inoffenſively before
Gods people in all things. The Proto-Type of Holineſs
is our Lord Chriſt, all his faithful Miniſters are to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
of him, that they may be examples to the flock,
1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 1. He that faileth in this Duty, and is not
deeply humbled for his failing, is far from Miniſterial
faithfulneſſe, and by his evil converſation doth more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
cry down, then by his good Doctrine preach up
the power of godlineſs.</p>
                     <p>6. Sixthly, Of a faithful Miniſter of the Goſpel it is
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:167980:56"/>
required that he watch over the ſouls of thoſe amongſt
whom he liveth, both for the preventing of hurtful errors,
and practical evils, both which tend to the deſtruction of
ſouls. It appeareth from <hi>Heb.</hi> 13. 17. that a ſpecial part
of the work of the Miniſters of the Goſpel is to have an
eye to the ſouls committed to them, that they be not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares
ſurpriſed by Errors in Doctrine, or evils in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.
Errors againſt the truth or holineſſe of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel,
are of an inſinuating nature, if they be not timely
reſiſted they will make room for themſelves, and bring on
a ſhipwrack of faith and a good conſcience together.
Miniſters of the Goſpel are therefore in faithfulneſs to
<hi>hold faſt the faithful Word as they have been taught,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tit. 1. 9</note> 
                        <hi>and by
ſound Doctrine both to exhort and convince the gainſayers:</hi>
They are with all circumſpection, ſpecially in ſuch Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatizing
times as we are fallen into, to look to the flock
of God, that they be not led away by the errour of the
wicked, or poſſibly of ſome good men miſguided in ſome
particulars, to fall from their own ſted faſtneſſe, but may
ſtand faſt and grow in grace, and in the knowledge of
our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. It may ſeem at firſt
a ſmall matter to let errour againſt the Truth or Holineſſe
of the Goſpel into the judgment; but the judgment tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with ſuch Errour, is apt to grant out diſpenſations
for the practice of ſin, and ſo a little Errour many times
draweth a great ſluce to let in a ſea of pollution upon
men to the drowning of them in everlaſting perdition. It
therefore belongeth to the faithfulneſſe of the Miniſters
of the Goſpel to fortifie and eſtabliſh their people, what
in them lyeth, in the Truth of the Goſpel, that they may
not be as <hi>children toſſed to and fro, and carried about with
every wind of Doctrine,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 14</note> 
                        <hi>by the ſleight of men, and cunning
craftineſs, whereby they lye in wait to deceive.</hi> but may
have their ears ſhut up againſt the voice of ſtrangers, and
opened only to the teaching of that good Shepherd who
hath the words of eternal life. And as faithful Miniſters
are to watch over the people in reſpect of Doctrinal Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,
ſo alſo of practical evils, that they do not overſpread
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:167980:57"/>
them; they are often to inculcate the Apoſtle Doctrine,
that <hi>the grace of God which bringeth ſalvation,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tit. 2, 11, 12 and 14</note> 
                        <hi>teacheth us,
that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live
ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent World;</hi> and
again, <hi>That our Lord Jeſus gave himſelf for us, that he
might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie unto himſelf a
peculiar people zealous of good works;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 19</note> and therefore that <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one that nameth the name of Chriſt ſhould depart from
iniquity.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 6. 1</note> And if they ſee any one <hi>taken in a fault</hi> through
infirmity, it belongeth to them not only in the right of
charity, but ſpecial duty <hi>to reſtore ſuch a one with the Spirit
of meekneſſe;</hi> and when they diſcover others hardning
themſelves obſtinately in their evil wayes,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 20</note> they are bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to reprove them, and yet <hi>with meekneſſe to inſtruct them,
yea though they oppoſe themſelves, if God peradventure would
give them repentance to the acknowledgment of the truth,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">2 Tim. 2. 25, 26</note> 
                        <hi>that
they may recover themſelves out the ſnare of the Divel, who
are taken captive at his will.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The ſum of all is, When a ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
to the Miniſtry of the Goſpel carefully mindeth his
work, and bendeth himſelf to deliver the Word of God
wholly, purely, and ſeaſonably, labouring inſtantly with
God by prayer to procure a bleſſing on his people, and his
labours amongſt them, and withal is careful to exemplifie
his own Doctrine, that the people may ſee in him what
they hear from him; and laſtly, hath his eyes open to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
and his mouth open to g<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ve warning of ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
Errors and Practices, as he ſeeth breaking in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſuch as are committed to his overſight, ſuch a one,
however he ſpeed in his own judgment, and the judgment
of others, ſhall not fail before the Judgment Seat of God,
to ſtand in the rank, and paſſe in the account of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
ſervants and Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                     <p>Having thus ſhewed when a man may be ſaid to bee a
faithful Miniſter of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, I come in the
next place to conſider, who are they who truly believe the
Goſpel to whom ſuch faithful Miniſters are precious, who
enjoy them in love, and part from them in ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="113" facs="tcp:167980:57"/>
There is hardly any thing (as I conceive) in our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled
times more pernicious, then the miſtake which
many are ſubject to about the nature of believing. Much
talk there is of faith and the Goſpel, whilſt few conſider
what is indeed the faith of the Goſpel. I ſhal therefore
indeavour in few and plain words, to clear unto you from
the Scriptures who are the truly faithful, the true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>1. Firſt, They truly believe the Goſpel, who glorifie
the Word of the Lord, as it is teſtifyed of the believing
Gentiles, to whom <hi>Paul</hi> preached the Goſpel at <hi>Antioch.
When the Gentiles heard this,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 13. 48</note> 
                        <hi>they were glad, and glorified
the Word of the Lord, and as many as were ordained to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
life believed.</hi> Every true Believer glorifieth the
Word of the Goſpel, by yeilding a firme aſſent unto it
as a word of Truth, ſetting a high price upon it as the
only ſaving Truth, holding it faſt as a ſtable, everlaſting
Truth, and ſtill deſiring of it, and delighting in it, as an
edifying and perfecting Truth, which is able to build men
up, and give them an inheritance amongſt thoſe that are
ſanctified. If men boaſt never ſo much of believing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are confident that Chriſt is theirs, and that
all the benefits which flow from the Lord Chriſt are
theirs; yet if they do not glorifie the Word of the Lord,
the Word of the Goſpel, making an high account of it as
a Word of Truth, a ſaving, everlaſting, edifying perfecting
Word; they ſhall never make it out before the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of God, that they have the true faith of the Goſpel
in them.</p>
                     <p>2. Secondly, True Believers of the Goſpel are ſuch as
receive the Word of the Goſpel with ſpiritual gladneſſe,
as we read of that flock of faithful Converts, brought in
at one Sermon,<note place="margin">Acts 2. 41</note> 
                        <hi>Then they that gladly received the word,
were baptized.</hi> The Word of the Goſpel cannot by faith
enter into the ſoul, but it bringeth in ſpiritual gladneſs
with it. Temporal believing hath a ſleight and ſuddain
joy accompanying it, as our Saviour teſtified in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of the Parable of the Sower, as to the ſtony
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:167980:58"/>
ground,<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>. 13. 20, 21</note> 
                        <hi>He that received the ſeed in ſtony places, the ſame
is he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it,
yet hath he not root in himſelf, but dureth for a while.</hi> An
unrooted faith yeildeth an unſettled joy, but when the
Word is with a ſtedfaſt, ſound, and ſaving faith received, it
uſually, out of the ſtate of ſtrong temptation, and ſpiritual
diſertion,<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>om. 15 13</note> 
                        <hi>filleth the ſoul with joy and peace in believing.</hi>
Now this receiving the Word by faith importeth a taking
of it into all the faculties of the ſoul, to new mould and
transform them according to the holineſs of the Goſpel.
The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> calleth it,<note place="margin">
                           <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>ames 1 21</note> 
                        <hi>the receiving of the engrafted
word,</hi> becauſe the word of the Goſpel thus received, as
the graft ſet into the ſtock, cauſeth all the ſap of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
faculties of the ſoul to bring forth ſuch fruit as is
ſutable to the holy Word of the Goſpel. It is a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
and ungrounded Opinion, that a man can belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly
receive the word of the Goſpel, and not be new
moulded by it unto holineſ. If any think that
the Word of the Goſpel ſhall be mighty to ſave them,
when it is not effectual to ſanctifie them, they deceive
themſelves, and ſhould attend to the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> his
Doctrine for right information in this point, who ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
that the Word of the Goſpel is received <hi>as an ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi>
new moulding <hi>word,</hi> in all thoſe towards whom <hi>it is ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual
to ſave their ſouls.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3 Thirdly, They that believingly receive the Word of
the Goſpel, are brought off from truſting upon their own
works and righteouſneſſe, to truſt, and reſt their ſouls
upon the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as the <hi>one,</hi> which in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
dialect imports the <hi>only</hi> Mediatour between God and
man, for forgiveneſſe of ſins, peace with God, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe
and eternal life. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
in Chriſt, <hi>hoping,</hi> or <hi>truſting in Chriſt,</hi> Epheſ. 1.
12, 13 becauſe all that truly believe, caſt away the thought
of acceptance with God unto life in the merit of their own
Righteouſneſſe, and as worthleſſe ſinners build their
hope of righteouſneſs to life fully and wholly upon the
Lord Jeſus as the Mediator of the New Teſtament, through
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:167980:58"/>
whom they finally bottom their faith and hope on God,
1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 21.</p>
                     <p>4 Fourthly, They truly believe the Goſpel who
truſting on Chriſt for Righteouſneſſe and life, have
their hearts brought on by believing, to the love
and high prizing of the Lord Jeſus as moſt precious
and deſirable, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 7. Faith looking and reſting
upon Chriſts love, inflameth the heart with the love
of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Gal. 5. 6</note> according to the Apoſtles words, <hi>In Chriſt
neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion,
but faith which worketh by love.</hi> And this true love of
Chriſt, the neceſſary and inſeparable product of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel
faith in all true Believers, is obediential, cauſing
the faithful heart to ſtoop to the yoak and work of the
Lord Chriſt, as we learne from our Saviours own mouth,
<hi>If ye love me keep my Commandments.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Joh. 14. 15. 21, 23</note> And again, <hi>He
that hath my Commandments and keepeth them, he it is that
loveth me.</hi> And yet further, <hi>If any man love me, he wil keep
my words.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>By all this it is manifeſt, That they who truly
believe the Goſpel are ſuch as glorifie the Goſpel,
by embracing it as a ſaving, everlaſting, edifying,
and perfecting Word of Truth; who with gladneſſe
receive this word into all the faculties of the ſoul,
to mould them into a frame of Goſpel holineſſe, who
reſt themſelves upon the Lord Chriſt for Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
and life according to the Goſpel, and
in the ſtrength of that faith have their hearts knit
to the Lord Chriſt, in high prizing obediential love
of him.</p>
                     <p>Theſe two Points being diſpatched; <hi>viz.</hi> Who
is a faithful Miniſter, and Who are the true Believers
of the Goſpel: I proceed in the next place to ſhew
that ſuch a Miniſter is enjoyed with much love by ſuch a
people.</p>
                     <p>This we have fully aſcertained by the Apoſtles teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:167980:59"/>
which hee bare unto the <hi>Galatians,</hi> when the
faith of the Goſpel at firſt prevailed amongſt them, <hi>My
temptation</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which was in my fleſh, ye deſpiſed
not,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gal. 4. 14.</note> 
                        <hi>nor rejected, but received me even as an Angel of
God, even as Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> It is not poſſible to make
a higher expreſſion of enlarged love, then this is,
whereby the Apoſtle ſet forth the affection which the
believing <hi>Galatians</hi> bare towards him as a Miniſter of
the Goſpel; who loved him, and welcomed him
upon this account, as they would have done an
Angel from Heaven, or the Lord Jeſus Chriſt
himſelfe, if he had perſonally appeared and ſpoken to
them.</p>
                     <p>The Grounds of this enlarged love of true Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
towards the faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel are, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
others, which it would be too large exactly to treat
of, theſe which follow.</p>
                     <p>1. Firſt, Believers look upon the faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Goſpel, as a ſpecial gift of Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
his Church. What thoughts ſoever others have of
faithful Miniſters, yet true Believers know that they
are in much love, given by the Lord Chriſt, for
<hi>the edifying of his body,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Epheſ. 4. 11, 12</note> 
                        <hi>till all the Members thereof
come in the unity of the Faith and Knowledge of the
Son of God unto a perfect man, to the meaſure of the
ſtature of the fulneſſe of Chriſt.</hi> And therefore
Believers cannot but love ſuch a guift of love proceeding
from their beloved Lord and Saviour.</p>
                     <p>2. Secondly, True Believers look upon the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Miniſters of the Goſpel as Ambaſſadors for Chriſt,
in whome hee negotiateth with them in much mercy
for the accompliſhing their reconciliation to God,
and eternal happineſſe. 2 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 5. 19, 20. And
therefore beholding Chriſt in them, they cannot but great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
love them in Chriſt, and very highly eſteem them in love
for their works ſake.</p>
                     <p>3. Thirdly, True Believers are experimentally aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:167980:59"/>
that the faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel are Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial
Fathers to ſome, and Nurſes to all Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who hear the Goſpel from their mouthes.</p>
                     <p>To ſuch as are brought out of a ſtate of ignorance
and wickedneſſe, unto the faith and obedience of Jeſus
Chriſt, by the Goſpel which they preach, they are mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial
Fathers, as we learne from what the Apoſtle
wrote to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 15</note> 
                        <hi>Though ye have ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
Inſtructors in Chriſt yet have ye not many Fathers; for
in Chriſt Jeſus I have begotten you through the Goſpel.</hi> The
Lord of his own will originally begetteth his children by
the word of Truth,<note place="margin">James 1. 18</note> diſpenſed in the mouthes of the
Preachers of the Goſpel; for, <hi>How ſhall they believe in
him of whom they have not heard? How ſhall they hear
without a Preacher? and how ſhall they preach except they
be ſent? As it is written, How beautiful upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
are the feet of them that preach the Goſpel of peace, and
bring glad tidings of good things?</hi> The faithful Miniſters of
the Goſpel of peace, given by our Lord Chriſt for the
work of the Miniſtry, are therefore Miniſterial Fathers
too, and ſo as ſpiritual parents acknowledged and beloved
by thoſe who through their Miniſtry are brought to the
faith of the Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>To others who have formerly entertained the truth of
the Goſpel in a regenerating power, the faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Goſpel are as Nurſes, cheriſhing and
ſtrengthening them by the Word of God, which they
preach. For the ſame Word of the Goſpel which beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
nouriſheth and buildeth up the people of God
unto eternal life. And in this ſecond cheriſhing work the
Miniſters of the Goſpel are and are acknowledged by belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
for ſpiritual Nurſes, according to the Apoſtles expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to the <hi>Theſſaloniuns,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 2. 7</note> 
                        <hi>We were gentle amongſt you, even as
a nurſe cheriſheth her own children.</hi> Now Nurſes (we know)
ſometimes get away the love of children from their
true parents; and in the caſe before us it is often
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:167980:60"/>
ſeen, that though true believers cannot forget their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial
Fathers, yet they are apt to fall much in love with
their ſpiritual Nurſes, who at preſent feed and refreſh
them with the word of Truth: The ſum is, that as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
or Nurſes, or both, all thoſe that truly believe
the Goſpel, are ready to love the faithful Miniſters of
the Goſpel whilſt they enjoy them.</p>
                     <p>Now this Truth being acknowledged, the laſt point I
am to ſpeak to in the Doctrine, becometh evident of
it ſelfe; namely, That a faithful Miniſter is finally
parted from with much ſorrow by thoſe who truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the Goſpel; for love is a ſtrong bond, knitting
the ſoul ſo faſt to that which is beloved, that it cannot
loſe it, or be looſed and parted from it without much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
                     <p>We read, that <hi>Jacob</hi> loved <hi>Joſeph</hi> more then all his
brethren; and when he thought that <hi>Joſeph</hi> was finally
taken from him,<note place="margin">Gen. 37. 34, 35</note> 
                        <hi>He rent his cloathes, and put ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath
upon his loynes, and mourned for his ſon many dayes.
And all his ſons and daughters roſe up to comfort him, and
he refuſed to be comforted; and he ſaid, For I will go down
into the grave unto my ſon mourning.</hi> And even thus it
is betweene true Believers and faithful Miniſters of the
Goſpel, the true and great love which ſuch Believers bear
unto ſuch Miniſters, makes their preſence ſweet, and
therefore neceſſarily their final parting very grievous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
them.</p>
                     <p>To this I will briefly add two further grounds of much
ſorrow in thoſe who truly believe the Goſpel for the
final removal of faithful Miniſters by death from
them.</p>
                     <p>1. Firſt, When faithful Miniſters are taken away
by death, Believers are at an utter loſſe, as to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
of any comfort or benefit from the perſon or
perſonal Miniſtry of them that are ſo removed from
them. If they could have the leaſt hope of re-enjoying
a faithful Miniſter after death, there would be yet ſome
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:167980:60"/>
ſtring of comfort to hold by at their departing; but
Believers know that this is a final parting from a faithful
Miniſter, they muſt never ſeek counſel, or comfort,
or inſtruction more from his mouth; death unavoydably
putteth the ſervants of Chriſt to ſilence, and taketh them
off from being in their perſons uſeful in the work of the
Miniſtry unto the living, for ever. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>
wrote to the <hi>Philippians,</hi> that his abiding in the fleſh
would be <hi>needful for them for their furtherance and joy of
Faith,</hi> Philip. 1. v. 24, 25. and thereby intimated, that
when he was by death removed from them, they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
could expect, nor ſhould receive any farther be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
from his perſon or perſonal Miniſtry. Herein our
bleſſed Saviour happily differeth from, and hath a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendent
preheminence above his ſervants in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
that whereas their final parting from their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
in the fleſh maketh them perſonally unuſeful to others
for the time to come; it was not ſo with our Lord Jeſus
Chriſt. His parting from his people in the fleſh, cauſed
a greater imparting of himſelf unto them in ſpiritual bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits,
as is teſtified by our Saviour himſelfe ſaying to
his Diſciples,<note place="margin">John 16. 7</note> 
                        <hi>Nevertheleſſe I tell you the truth, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
for you that I go away; for if I go not away, the
Comforter will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will ſend
him unto you.</hi> Our Saviour went away as a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour
and Advocate between God and Man, and not as
a bare Miniſter of the Goſpel; and in that regard he
was forward by his departure in doing good to his
ſervants, and continueth more able to communicate
himſelf in all celeſtial and ſpiritual bleſſings to thoſe
that wait upon him;<note place="margin">Revel. 1</note> for, <hi>he is ſtill walking in the midſt
of the golden candleſticks, and hath the ſtars in his right
hand;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Heb. 7. 25</note> and is <hi>able to ſave to the uttermoſt them that come
to God by him, becauſe he ever liveth to make Interceſſion
for them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But none of theſe things hold in the inferiour Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Goſpel; when they are removed by death,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:167980:61"/>
their perſonal Miniſtry, from the moment of their death,
ceaſeth for ever as to all uſes and advantages in
reſpect of others; and that conſideration layeth a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
weight of ſadneſſe upon the hearts of Believers,
when their faithful Miniſters are by death taken from
them.</p>
                     <p>2. Secondly, True Believers know that the final re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
of faithful Miniſters from any people, carryeth
in it the face of a Judgement from the Lord. It was a
Promiſe of great love,<note place="margin">Jer. 3. 15</note> 
                        <hi>I will give you Paſtors according
to my heart, which ſhall feed you with knowledge and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi>
And on the contrary, when the Lord taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
faithful Miniſters from any people, he then depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
them of one of his choiceſt mercyes upon earth,
which cannot therefore but have the appearance of a
Judgement in the eyes of true Believers.</p>
                     <p>The Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> repreſented evil men as weary
of the faithful Teachers, and ſaying to them, <hi>Prophecy
ye not,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Micah 2. 6</note> and then from the Lord denounced the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their ceaſing from amongſt them, <hi>They ſhall not
prophecy unto them.</hi> Their refuſal of the Prophets was
their great ſin, and the Lords removal of his Prophets
was his heavy judgment upon them.</p>
                     <p>If it be asked concerning a faithful Miniſter when he
dyeth, of what Diſeaſe he dyed? it may be often truly
anſwered, of the judgment of God upon an unthankful
people. When men are ſick again of their faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,
and long to be rid of them, it is a righteous thing
with God to let them dye, that ſuch a people may dye
without inſtruction. The contempt of the Miniſters of
the Goſpel who deſire to be faithful, is a ſpreading Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
amongſt us at this day. Men looking divers wayes,
do yet unanimouſly conſent to render the Miniſters of
the Goſpel in this Nation as odious as poſſibly they can.
Without diſtinction they are all branded as Tythe-Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
Time ſervers, Antichriſtian, Self-ſeekers, and
what not? But it is enough, that God is the ſupreme
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:167980:61"/>
Judge of thoſe that are thus traduced, and of their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> howbeit, whilſt this Diſeaſe ſo generally
reigneth and rageth, it is no marvel though many of
Gods faithful ſervants dye of it, whoſe removal by
death, though poſſibly ſome triumph in, yet the true
Believers of the Goſpel, of whom there is (bleſſed be
the Lord) a very conſiderable number throughout
our Land, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>annot but be,  as they are, much ſadded at it,
as carrying the face of an ill preſaging judgement
in it.</p>
                     <p>Having thus gone through the Doctrine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
I come now to a few words of Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>1. Here is one work whereby they that truly believe
the Goſpel may have reflexive knowledge of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
namely, by their enjoying the faithful Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of the Goſpel in love, and parting with them in
ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>I know there is great difference of judgement at this
day, who are to be accounted the faithful Miniſters of
the Goſpel of Chriſt? To this an anſwer may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
from what I have before delivered; at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
I ſhall only ſay this, That they who being in
the place of the Miniſters of the Goſpel, do viſibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
themſelves to do the work of the Miniſters of
the Goſpel, labouring in the Word and Doctrine,
that they may miniſterially tranſlate men out of
darkneſſe into the Kingdom of Gods dear Son, and
build them up in faith and holineſſe to eternal life,
are ſo farre (doubtleſſe) unto others at leaſt, the
faithful Miniſters of the Goſpel, that they who take
them to be ſuch, and as ſuch, enjoy them in love,
and part from them in ſorrow, may from that diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of theirs receive ſome evidence in themſelves that
they are in the number of the true Believers of the
Goſpel, whereas they who make it a chief ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:167980:62"/>
of their Religion, to ſcorne and revile the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
of the Goſpel whilſt they live, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
over them when they dye, to vomit out their
choler upon them both living and dying, are not
likely, for ought I can learne from the Scriptures,
to be approved by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
as true Lovers, and Believers of his bleſſed
Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>2. Secondly, This ſhould be a ſtrong inducement
to thoſe that are imployed in the Miniſtry of the
Goſpel to make it their ſpecial deſire, care, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to be found faithful in the Work of the Lord
committed to them, that they may bee enjoyed in
love, and have the true Believers of the Goſpel
their unfeigned Mourners at their Funeral. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
ſaith,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4. 1, 2</note> 
                        <hi>Let a man ſo account of us, as of the
Miniſters of Chriſt, and Stewards of the myſteries of
God. Moreover it is required in Stewards, that a
man be found faithful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Office (as we ſee) which God hath called the
Miniſters of the Goſpel unto, calleth upon them to be
faithful. Without faithfulneſſe a nominal Miniſter of
the Goſpel, how much ſoever he boaſteth and pride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
himſelfe in his Office, is but like unſavoury ſalt,
good for nothing but to be trodden under foot with
contempt both by God and men. But when faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
is found in a Miniſter of the Goſpel, it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
him ſhine as a Star, very gloriouſly in the eyes
of the Lord, and all true Believers. That Miniſter
of the Goſpel hath the beſt monument to perpetuate
his name with honour, whoſe faithfulneſſe in the
Miniſtry, hath procured him the love of true
Believers, ſo that his preſence is pleaſant to them
in life, and his memory precious with them after
death.</p>
                     <p>3. In the third place, the ſervants of God may here
read their warrant for ſadly bewailing and mourning
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:167980:62"/>
over ſuch as have been faithful in in the Miniſtry
of the Goſpel, when they are by death finally ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from them.</p>
                     <p>Heatheniſh mourning over the dead accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with murmuring and impaciency againſt God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh
not the children of God in any wiſe. It
is the Lords command given of old to the Jewes, <hi>Ye
are the children of the Lord your God,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 14. 1.</note> 
                        <hi>you ſhall not
cut your ſelves; nor make any baldneſſe betweene your
eyes for the dead.</hi> Becauſe they were by Covenant
the children of God above other Nations, therefore
they were not to follow the practice of other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
in their exceſſive mourning for the dead, but
to quiet themſelves in the will of their God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
knowing that his Saints are precious in his ſight
both in life and death. And accordingly the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
<hi>Paul</hi> carefully provided that the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi>
having imbraced the Goſpel of Chriſt, might not
ſorrow over their dead as Heathens, deſtitute
of hope of a future happineſſe or glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,
1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. 13. Howbeit, with due mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
in humility of ſoul, and quiet ſubmiſſion to
the will of God, it is not onely warrantable, but
laudable; a practice which grace bringeth the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of God unto, to mourne over the faithful Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
of God, when they are by death called home
out of this preſent world.</p>
                     <p>When <hi>Steven</hi> was ſlaine by the Jewes, <hi>Devout
men carried him to his Burial,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Acts 8. 2</note> 
                        <hi>and made great lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
over him.</hi> This is mentioned by the Holy Ghoſt
not as a groundleſſe, but as a gracious practice of
theſe Believers, evidencing their Chriſtian love to
<hi>Stephen,</hi> that bleſſed Martyr of the Lord.</p>
                     <p>In proportion to this great lamentation made by
devout men at <hi>Stephens</hi> Funeral, and the ſore weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Believers of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> at <hi>Pauls</hi> final par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
from them, mentioned in my Text, I doubt not
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:167980:63"/>
but our mourning over our deceaſed Brother at this
time is lawful, and laudable in the preſence of the
Lord.</p>
                     <p>I will not multiply words in reference to this our
Reverend Brother now taken from us, I ſhall leave
his Works to praiſe him in the Gate, being well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured,
that many who have felt and taſted the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and comfort of his Miniſtry, will beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to him, and the working of God in him for their
good.</p>
                     <p>One thing there is relating to his death which I
cannot omit, that the Lord greatly teſtified his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation
of him in his Work, in that he dyed of
<hi>Epaphroditus</hi> his ſickneſſe,<note place="margin">Phil. 2. 30</note> of whom the Apoſtle wrote,
That <hi>for the work of Chriſt he was nigh unto death.</hi> The
Work of Chriſt, of which <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> was ſick,
was, as far as wee can judge, a ſpecial part of the
Diſeaſe of which this our Brother dyed; for after
that ſome ſymptomes and beginnings of a bodily weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
had ſeized upon him, his turn came to ſupply
a Lecture at a place ſomewhat remote from his owne
habitation, which therefore ſome, neerly related to
him, earneſtly perſwaded him to forbear for that
time; but ſuch was his Zeal towards the work of
Chriſt, that it cauſed him to neglect his friends ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
and his own health, and to overlook his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
danger, and ſo undertake the Work of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Goſpel in his courſe, under the weight of
which labour of love, his weak body did apparently
ſink in the time and place of that publick ſervice;
after which returning home, he declined more and
more untill the time of his death.</p>
                     <p>Our Saviours words therefore ſeem plainly to reach
this our Brother, and pronounce him bleſſed, <hi>Bleſſed
is that ſervant whom the Lord when he cometh ſhall find ſo
ſo doing.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Matth. 24. 4 6.</note> The Lord <hi>when he came</hi> to this our Brother,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:167980:63"/>
by death, <hi>found him doing, ſo doing,</hi> doing his Lords
Work faithfully, and therefore looking on him, we
have cauſe to part with him rejoycingly, being much
aſſured of his bleſſedneſſe; yet looking at our ſelves,
we have cauſe to part with him ſadly, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
that we ſhal have his help, and ſee his face no
more.</p>
                     <p>A Pillar is fallen, and by the fall thereof a
great breach made in this place, this County, this
Land; which that the Lord may be pleaſed in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to make up, by increaſing the number, ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the hands, and bleſſing the Labours of his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Servants in the Miniſtry, we have great cauſe to
bow our knees before him, and to beg this favor from
him in the name of the Lord Jeſus; to whom with the
Father, and bleſſed Spirit, be praiſe and Glory for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
<hi>Amen.</hi>
