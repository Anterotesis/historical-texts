            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>THE Statutes of <hi>Bankrupts,</hi> and the Proceedings thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (to any perſons who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the leaſt Commerce, and know the World but at an ordinary rate) will certainly appear to be very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant; and not only in reſpect of the greatneſs of the Eſtates, the variety and multiplicity of Debts, Credits and Accounts, about which they are
<pb facs="tcp:34031:3"/>
concerned (the effects whereof are derived down upon thouſands of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies) but alſo in regard of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Severities and Penalties which are inflicted on the Offenders. And I have often wondred, that ſo little hath been written on a Subject which makes <hi>ſo great a Figure</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Men of Buſineſs, either at <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> or upon the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</hi> Nay, I may add (to carry on this Reflection a little further) the concerns of Bankrupts, which were heretofore almoſt wholly managed within the Precincts of our Capital City or famous Marts, are now deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into Country-Towns and Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, ſo that it is become a matter of Publick Conſideration.</p>
            <p>There are but two (that I know of) who have deſignedly Treated on this Subject: Mr. <hi>Serjeant Stone,</hi> who was a Learned Lawyer and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Commiſſioner in his time, hath left us his Readings on one of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes againſt Bankrupts; which are indeed full of Moot-Caſes, ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly contrived, but there are not
<pb facs="tcp:34031:3"/>
many ſtated Reſolutions; the Caſes of Services, Tenures, Seiſins, Ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and the like, are not practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble now; and beſides, he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his Reading to one Statute on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and that the firſt; whereas the defects of that Law hath been abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly aided and ſupplied by ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Statutes, ſo that He cannot be ſufficiently directive in this Grand Concern: And Mr. <hi>Billinghurſt,</hi> who, for ſo much as he hath attempted, is Acceptable; but we muſt ſay, he hath done little more than to improve the method to which the Statutes themſelves naturally lead him; the Reſolutions are but few, neither do they extend to thouſands of Caſes that daily happen in theſe weighty matters.</p>
            <p>Having therefore had ſome looſe Papers, relating to this Subject, brought to my hands, upon peruſal of them, I found they might be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as well for Lawyers as Merchants and other Traders: I conſidered we are not born meerly for our ſelves, we are ſometimes, at leaſt, obliged to
<pb facs="tcp:34031:4"/>
render our ſelver <hi>ſerviceable</hi> to the welfare of the Publick Society where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we are Members, and to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may be uſeful for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. I then (the whole being left to my diſpoſal) made ſome Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Subſtractions, as I thought convenient, and moulded them into ſome Frame and Order; the reſult whereof is this little Piece (for Volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minouſneſs I never affected) which I now preſent to you. Whereof I think it becomes me to give this ſhort Account:</p>
            <p>To addreſs my ſelf then in the firſt place to the Gentlemen of the Long Robe, I conceive it might be ſome advantage, not only to cite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (under Proper Titles) our Printed Law Caſes, and in ſome places to correct them, (but that very ſparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for it is expected we ſhould read Reporters in their own Words) but to add ſome Caſes not extant, which I have obſerved in the Courſe of my Profeſſion. I have, in ſome meaſure, conſidered the Learning of Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Pleadings upon Actions
<pb facs="tcp:34031:4"/>
brought by the Aſſignees of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, the uſefulneſs whereof I need not ſtand to Illuſtrate. The Forms and Preſidents (tho' I have not diſplayed all the <hi>Arcana</hi>'s of the Commiſſioners Practice) will be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to give ſuch hints and helps to an ingenious inquiſitive Mind, as thereby to enable him, upon occaſion, to frame Inſtruments of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. In which let me recommend the Preſident of the <hi>Scire Facias</hi> upon a Judgment recovered by the Bankrupt againſt an Executrix, which I take to be the exacteſt in its kind, and which was found in the Manuſcripts of Mr. <hi>Pynſent,</hi> a very Judicious Practiſer and Prothonotary of the <hi>Common Pleas</hi> (now deceaſed.)</p>
            <p>As for the Merchants and Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the advantage of a Treatiſe of this Nature will appear if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them as Creditors or Debtors, and into one of theſe two Ranks we may generally caſt them. For, it is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally impoſſible to think that a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant can make a ſolemn Proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this ſort; <hi>I owe to no Body,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:34031:5"/>
               <hi>and no Body owes to me.</hi> Affairs of this nature cannot admit of ſuch even Ballances: If we conſider the proſpects and allurements of Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and Profit, the inſinuations of Buſineſs, the Twiſtings and Links of Commerce; in ſhort (I ſay) if we reflect on the Revolutions, Movements and Intreagues of Trading, we may then find reaſon to pronounce, that no Trading Merchant (while he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues ſuch) can ſay to his Shop<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Book (which is as reſtleſs as that watry and unſtable Element) <hi>hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſhalt thou go and no further.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You who are not not only dipt, but drencht in Debt, may ſee here how to manage your Concerns with ſo much Prudence, as to avoid thoſe dangerous Shelfs on which thouſands of Families have been irrecoverably ruin'd. For I am very confident, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have committed, or ſuffered ſuch Acts of Bankrupcy, which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver underſtood would bring them within the Compaſs of the Statutes, but have thought that it only conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Abſconding or downright Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:34031:5"/>You who are Creditors, may in this receive hints how to ſecure your Debts in time, and to be precautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not to be too forward in any fraudulent Contrivances, when you are ſenſible your Debtor is a Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, tho' no Commiſſion be award<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out againſt him: And alſo how, and in what time you are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by the Statutes, and whether you are ſuch Creditors who are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Relief.</p>
            <p>It muſt be granted, and it's the ſubject of pity rather than ſcorn, that many good Men may, and do inſenſibly ſink and decay in their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, either by loſſes at Sea or Land, living up to ſupport a Credit, and ſhoar up a Reputation (no mean Myſtery in this World) or by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and hidden determinations of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, which will ſometimes baffle human deſigns, and will teach us not to aſcribe Succeſs always to our own Induſtry: And therefore frequently preſents Inſtances to confirm the truth of the Wiſe Mans Obſervation, <hi>The</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:34031:6"/>
               <hi>Battle is not always to the Strong, neither Bread to the Wiſe, nor yet Riches to Men of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A Bankrupt, by Fraud, I always hated, I mean one that breaks on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to raiſe a Fortune by the ruin of others; tho' my Charity and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will induce me to believe ſuch are not very ordinary. To leave a dear Family to the taunts and ſcorns of inconſiderate and inſulting Fools, to roll about the World ones ſelf like an Outlaw or a Fugitive, certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are not things of choice, they are in no wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> fevere enough againſt them. But I regret the proceedings againſt Bankrupts by Accident, (if we muſt allow of that diſtinction) and am ſorry they are involved in the ſame Penalties.</p>
            <p>But I muſt digreſs no further. I have only to add, My deſign in this is for the Publick Good of my Countrymen: And upon that ſcore I muſt rely upon the Readers pardon
<pb facs="tcp:34031:6"/>
for my Miſtakes: However, if he will be ſo inexorable as not to grant me a total diſcharge from my Errors, yet I hope my honeſt intentions may molli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <div type="part">
               <head>This Deſcription conſiſts of theſe ſeveral parts.</head>
               <p>1. ABſconding or withdrawing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himſelf, and that is Four Ways.</p>
               <p>1. By departing the Realm. Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> in his Lecture, puts this Caſe. If a man<note place="margin">Departing the Realm.</note> depart the Realm, and long time after his departure becomes <hi>non ſolvent,</hi> his abſenting himſelf in ſuch a Caſe brings him within the Statute of Bankrupts, p.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:34031:28"/>
133. It ſeems otherwiſe, For ſuppoſe a Wealthy Merchant goes beyond Sea with a good Cargoe, and ſtates his Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts with his Creditors, who know of his Voyage, and are pleaſed therewith, and he ſends over ſeveral effects to them, and they truſt him in the way of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-factor; and after five or ſeven years ſpace, he by Loſſes becomes <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvent,</hi> and abides beyond Sea; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this is not within the Statute. For the Statute of 17 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 7. ſaith, That this withdrawing or abſenting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt be on purpoſe to defraud his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors; and this can never be conſtrued ſo; and we muſt imagin after his <hi>non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvency,</hi> he muſt ſtay to get up his Eects.</p>
               <p>2. Departing from their Dwelling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes.<note place="margin">Departure from his Houſe.</note> It need not be a total departure; for as it is rightly put, If one that hath an Houſe, and yet abſents for fear of Arreſt, for a time, and then returns, yet he is a Bankrupt. Suppoſe a man hath no Dwelling-houſe, but ſojourns ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time at one place, and ſometime at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet if he appear not at his uſual times or places of Trade as formerly, nor can be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ound as formerly, this is within the words of 13 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 7. or <hi>otherwiſe abſent himſelf.</hi> So a Lodger in a Chamber. Yet Query: For if he ſometimes abſent himſelf, and at other<note place="margin">Denial to be at home.</note> times when he thinks himſelf ſafe from Arreſts, appears publickly, as upon the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:34031:28"/>
open <hi>Exchange,</hi> this ſeems to be a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of abſenting or withdrawing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before, as it was held in the Caſe of <hi>Hind</hi> the Banker, who was ſometimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied at his Houſe, tho' within; yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards appearing upon the open <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,</hi> 'twas held in that Caſe, that this appearing publickly purged ſuch his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial or abſence.</p>
               <p>3. Keeping their Houſes. 20 <hi>Jac. B. R. Taylor</hi> and <hi>Hills</hi> Caſe. It was reſolved,<note place="margin">Keeping his Houſe.</note> That the keeping within his Houſe, unleſs to defraud and delay Creditors, makes him not a Bankrupt. But if he conceal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for Debt, for which he is ſued, and to delay and defraud his Creditors, tho' but for an hour, this makes him a Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt. <hi>Palmers Rep. 325. Haylor</hi> and <hi>Hall.</hi> Yet it is adjudged, <hi>Croke, Eliz.</hi> Fo. 13.—If a Trader, on notice of Proceſs iſſued forth againſt him, keeps in to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure himſelf from the Arreſt, and after goeth forth again; and then upon like notice keeps his Houſe, and then goeth forth again, this brings him not within the Statutes; becauſe he uſeth to go at large, and he may be met with one time or other. But <hi>Quere</hi> of this Reſolution. For if this be Law, then I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the words in 1 <hi>Jac. c. 15. or begin to keep his or her Houſe:</hi> And alſo certainly this is a keeping in to delay and hinder Creditors, 17 <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 7. If the keeping in be to defraud or delay
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:34031:29"/>
the payment, he is a Bankrupt: And Serjeant <hi>Stone</hi> faith well, <hi>Fo.</hi> 10. If a Trader abſents himſelf for fear of being Arreſted by a Writ <hi>de Excommunicato Cap.</hi> Or if a Decree in Chancery be made againſt him to execute a Conveyance, and he keeps in, or withdraws himſelf for fear of being Attached for not perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Decree; ſuch withdrawing doth not make him a Bankrupt. <hi>Aliter,</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps if ſuch Decree had been for pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mony, as it was held in the Caſe of one <hi>Albyn,</hi> a <hi>Turky</hi> Merchant. If a Church warden (Trader) keeps the Church; that is either a keeping his Houſe, or taking Sanctuary. So if a Miller keep in his Mill, that is a keeping his Houſe.</p>
               <p>4. Taking Sanctuary. Theſe were priviledged places formerly, but now the Kings Officers may go into any place. If a Merchant abſcond, and liſt himſelf a Dragooner in the Kings Service, or buy a Captains place; yet a Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may go out againſt him, this is no protection within the the Statute. If a Trader be preſt into the King's Service, I conceive it otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:34031:29"/>II. The next part of the deſcription is, about the Bankrupts being Arreſted and Impriſoned: Which is either</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Voluntarie &amp; permiſſive,</hi> and fraudulent, Or, Forced, and ſo continuing in Priſon.</p>
               <p>1. Voluntary and permiſſive, 13 Eliz.<note place="margin">Feigned Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> c. 27. <hi>If any ſuch Trader ſhall ſuffer him or her ſelf willingly to be Arrested for any Debt, or other thing not grown, or due for Monies delivered, Wares ſold, or any other juſt or lawful Cauſe,</hi> 1 Jac. 15. <hi>Or ſhall willingly or fraudulently procure him or her ſelf to be Arreſted,</hi> 13 Eliz. c. 7. 1 Jac. c. 15. <hi>If any ſuch Trader ſhall yield him or her ſelf to Priſon; this is to be underſtood of voluntary and feigned Actions;</hi> as run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into the Kings Bench or Fleet.</p>
               <p>Or ſhall ſuffer him or her ſelf to be<note place="margin">Outlaw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>.</note> outlawed. 13 <hi>Eliz. c. 7. 1 Jac. c.</hi> 15. One Outlaw'd in <hi>Ireland,</hi> is not thereby a Bankrupt here; for that the Record is not pleadable here, <hi>Stone</hi> 172. Now the Reaſon of this Clauſe is, becauſe by the Outlawry the King is intitled to the Goods, and ſo ſeems to be a fraud to the Creditors, which the Law abhors: But if the Debtor reverſe the Outlawry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Commiſſion of Bankrupts ſued out, it ſeems otherwiſe, as Mr. <hi>Billinghurſt</hi> conjectures. If it be Reverſed for want
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:34031:30"/>
of Proclamations, all done in the mean time by the Commiſſioners is void.</p>
               <p>If the Jury or Special Verdict, find a Bankrupt Outlaw'd, they muſt find he was outlawed <hi>in Fraudem Creditorum,</hi> and to that intent, 1 <hi>Keb. 11. Bradford</hi>'s Caſe.</p>
               <p>2. Forced Arreſt or Impriſonment, and there the deſcription is this: 1 Jac. c. 15. <hi>If ſuch a Trader (as aforeſaid) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Arrested for Debt, ſhall after her or his Arreſt lie in Priſon ſix Months or more upon that Arreſt, or upon any other Arreſt, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in Priſon for Debt, and lie in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſix Months upon ſuch Arreſt or Deten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhall be judged a Bankrupt.</hi> 21 Jac. c. 19. <hi>If any ſuch Trader</hi> (as aforeſaid) <hi>being indebted unto any Perſon or Perſons in the ſum of 100 l. or more, ſhall not pay or otherwiſe compound for the ſame within ſix Months next after the ſame ſhall grow due, and the Debtor be arreſted for the ſame; or being Arrested for Debt, ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his or her Arreſt lie in Priſon two Months or more upon that or any other Arreſt or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in Priſon for Debt; or being Arreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Sum of 100 l. or more of juſt Debt or Debts, ſhall at any time after ſuch Arreſt eſcape out of Priſon, or procure his Enlargemement by putting in Common or Hired Bail, ſhall be adjudged a Bankrupt; and in the ſaid Caſes of Arreſt, or lying in Priſon for ſuch Debt or Debts, or getting out by Common or Hired Bayl from the time of his, or her ſaid first Arreſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="tcp:34031:30"/>Obſerve this difference,</p>
               <p>If ſuch Trader owe 100 <hi>l.</hi> and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and doth not pay or compound for the ſame, within ſix Months next af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſame ſhall grow due, and the Debtor ſhall be Arreſted for the ſame, he is a Bankrupt, <hi>per 21 Jac.</hi> 19. But a Clauſe comes after, And being Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted for Debt, ſhall lie in Priſon two Months and more; which includes as well under as above an 100 <hi>l.</hi> So that if a Statute-trader owes me 100 <hi>l.</hi> and doth not pay it or compound for it within ſix Months after its due, and he be Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted for it, this makes him a Bankrupt; and if he owe me 20 <hi>l.</hi> and ſhall be Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted for it, and lie in Priſon two Months, this makes him a Bankrupt. <hi>Durus Sermo.</hi> The Act ſaith, if he do not compound; ſuppoſe his Creditors will not, then he muſt of neceſſity lie in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; (<hi>upon any other Arreſt or Detention for Debt.)</hi> I conceive the meaning of theſe words are, for Debt originally, and not Debt by reaſon of a Fine impoſed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the Statute hath reſpect to Creditors, either by way of Contract, Exchanging, Buying, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not Fines or Amercia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which no way reſpect Trade. (or <hi>ſhall lie in Priſon after his or her Arreſt two Months or more, on that or any other Arreſt, or Detention in Priſon for Debt)</hi> on which I will put this Caſe. One owes 100 <hi>l.</hi> and is Arreſted and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:34031:31"/>
and in a Fortnights time pays<note place="margin">Lying in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> it; and during that Fortnight another Action of 100 <hi>l.</hi> is entred againſt him, and he pays that in a Fortnights time after; and ſo another Fortnight he pays a third Action off. <hi>Quere</hi> if this be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Statute lying two Months or more on that or any other Arreſt. I conceive not. For by that payment he is diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from that Debt, and ſo not in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on that account.</p>
               <p>But the Caſe which Mr. <hi>Billinghurſt</hi> puts. Suppoſe (ſaith he, <hi>p.</hi>—) a man be Arreſted upon a Bond before the day of payment, as by the Cuſtom of <hi>London</hi> he may, and lie in Priſon two Months, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Quere</hi> is, whether this be ſuch an Arreſt for Debt as is within the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute. It ſeems doubtful. For tho' it be <hi>debitum in praeſenti,</hi> and ſo a releaſe of all Debts ſhall extend to it; yet it is not properly a Debt within the words or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Statute, for that muſt be ſuch a Debt for which a Cauſe of Action is given; and there can be no cauſe of Action properly, till the forfeiture, for the Obligation is guided by the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and the Cuſtom of <hi>London</hi> will not help it: For the Cuſtom is not, that he ſhall be Arreſted for the Payment of the Mony, but to find better Sureties. And the Statute only intends Detention in Priſon for a juſt Debt really due. But I ſubmit my reaſon to the Judicious Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:34031:31"/>Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> puts a Queſtion. If a man remaining in Priſon ſix Months at the Suit of the King, makes him a Bankrupt? It may be Anſwered, if it be for a Debt, it doth; if on a Criminal Matter it doth not.</p>
               <p>The next part of the Deſcription is, 21 <hi>Jac. c.</hi> 19.</p>
               <p>If ſuch a Trader being indebted unto any perſon or perſons, in the Sum of One Hundred Pounds or more, and ſhall not pay or otherwiſe compound for the ſame within ſix Months next after the ſame ſhall grow due, and the Debtor be Arreſted for the ſame, or <hi>within ſix</hi>
                  <note place="margin">After an Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Writ ſued out.</note> 
                  <hi>Months next after an Original Writ ſued out to recover the ſaid Debt, and notice thereof be given unto him, or left in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at his or their Dwelling-Houſe, or last place of abode.</hi> This is plain, and needs no explanation. It was reſolved in the Court of Kings Bench, on a Tryal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sir <hi>Anthony Bateman, Term. Mich.</hi> 1671. That one may become a Bankrupt, by reaſon of a Suit in the Exchequer, altho' the Statute ſpeaks only of Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Writs; for the Statutes ſhall have a beneficial conſtruction. <hi>Per Hales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next is per Stat. 21 Jac. c. 19.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If ſuch Trader (as aforeſaid) being Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted</hi>

                  <hi>by Common or Hired Bail, he ſhall be adjudged a Bankrupt; and in the ſaid Caſes of Arrest, or lying in Priſon for ſuch Debt or Debts, or getting out by Common or Hired Bail, he ſhall be adjudged a Bankrupt from the time of his first Arreſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Suppoſe one ſo Arreſted lies in Priſons three Terms, and no Declaration comes in againſt him, and he by courſe of Law is let out at Common-Bayl, <hi>Quere,</hi> if he be within the Statute: for that is a Legal Courſe; and the word (procure) in the Statute is taken <hi>in malam partem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next is, per 21 Jac.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If ſuch Trader ſhall by himſelf, or others</hi>

               </p>
               <p>This is plain, All Protections are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Statute, except Parliament Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections duly obtained.</p>
               <p>The next is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Or if ſuch Trader ſhall prefer or exhibit</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Petition to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure time.</note>

               <p>But if the Debtor call his Creditors to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and they grant him Licenſe for longer time, this Act makes him not a Bankrupt; this is no fraud, nor intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to defraud.</p>
               <p>The laſt part of the deſcription is about Frauds; and that is in two Paragraphs.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Fraud as to Goods.</note> (as aforeſaid) <hi>ſhall willingly or fraudulently procure his or her Goods, Mony or Chattels to be Attached or Sequeſtred, ſhall be adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Bankrupt.</hi> But then note, That this muſt be of the Parties immediate procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and not by his meer Default or Latcheſs. For the words of the Statute are <hi>willingly and fraudulently;</hi> therefore Mr. <hi>Stone,</hi> p. 172. is right in this Caſe. A Merchant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> hath an Impropriate Rectory; the Choire is not repaired, the Tythes are ſequeſtred; it is no Sequeſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion within this Statute; for tho' this is his default in not repairing the Church, yet it is not of his immediate procuring. So in Caſes of other Attachments out of any Court.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:34031:33"/>2. Per Stat. 1 Jac. 15. <hi>If any ſuch Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Lands or Goods.</note> 
                  <hi>ſhall make, or cauſe to be made any fraudulent Grant or Conveyance of his, her or their Lands or Tenements, Goods or Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, to the intent, or whereby his, her or their Creditors, being Subjects born (but</hi> Per 21 Jac. <hi>it extends to all Strangers) ſhall or may be defeated or delayed for the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of their juſt and true Debts, ſhall be adjudged a Bankrupt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for the further explication of this laſt Paragraph about fraudulent Sales and Conveyances, I ſhall ſhew</p>
               <p>What Sales and Conveyances, made by the Bankrupt, ſhall be ſaid to be fraudulent within this Statute, and what not; I mean as to make him a Bankrupt: for as for what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances ſhall be adjudged fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in this Statute in reference to Purchaſers, I ſhall conſider after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>And they may be conſidered two ways.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Either ſuch as are made long before he becomes a Bankrupt. Or,</item>
                  <item>2. Such as are made ſome ſhort time before; for what is done after the time of Bankrupcy is totally void.</item>
               </list>
               <p>But firſt I ſhall obſerve any one ſingle Act of theſe deſcriptions is ſufficient to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:34031:33"/>
make ſuch Trader (as aforeſaid) a Bankrupt. And that (as by the Pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the ſeveral Statutes againſt Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts it appears) the main intent of the Statutes is to relieve Creditors againſt Frauds and Deceits; tho' in ſome of the forementioned deſcriptions a delaying of Creditors is provided againſt, as the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Priſon ſix Months, or two Months, or not paying or compounding, <hi>per 21 Jac. &amp;c.</hi> yet Fraud and Cheat lies, or ſhould lie at the bottom of all; and I underſtand not the diſtinction of a Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt by Fraud, and a Bankrupt by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, which I find in ſome of our Books, as the Laws have been expounded.</p>
               <p>Any Fraudulent Conveyance within the Stat. 13 <hi>Eliz. &amp; 25 Eliz.</hi> is within this Clauſe. But I ſhall not ſtand upon the explication of thoſe two Statutes, it being a diſtinct Head from my preſent purpoſe; but ſhall come to ſet down ſome Caſes, wherein Conveyances and Sales, made by the Bankrupt, have been adjudged Fraudulent, and which make him ſuch.</p>
               <p>If a Trader, finding himſelf ſink in his Eſtate, and doth make a Conveyance of all his Lands and Goods to Truſtees for the payment of his real Debts, and then abſents; yet this Conveyance, tho' it may be truly and honeſtly made
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:34031:34"/>
and intended, ſhall not excuſe him; for his very abſconding makes him a Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt: But if he abſcond not, but declares his intention to pay his Debts, and the Truſtees act accordingly, and pay as far as it will go proportionably, this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance, without other act ſhall not make him a Bankrupt; for here is no fraud.</p>

            <argument>
               <p>Rules for the Conſtructions of the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and when the Bankrupcy ſhall be ſaid to Commence.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THE Statutes having made a full deſcription of the Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt; do then order how, and in what manner the Commiſſioners ſhall act. Before we fall directly upon that, I ſhall name two or three things out of theſe Statutes which are neceſſary and uſeful to be known. As,</p>
            <p>Note 1. <hi>Per Stat. 21 Jac. c.</hi> 19. Theſe Statutes of Bankrupcy are favourably to be conſtrued for the Creditors, being made for the ſuppreſſion of Fraud. <hi>Vide</hi> this explained in many Caſes hereafter;
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:34031:36"/>
and yet this ſhould not be too far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended. For the Statutes are highly pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s Remark is good, <hi>It is an hard caſe to torture Laws, that they may torture Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Note 2. By Stat. 13 <hi>Eliz.</hi> He that is a<note place="margin">Alien.</note> Bankrupt muſt be a Subject born in the King's Dominions or Denizen.</p>
            <p>One is born in the <hi>Iſle of Man.</hi> Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> ſeems, that he cannot be a Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, becauſe it hath been adjudged that it is not parcel of the Realm. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſpute it is within the Kings Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; and the King grants it to a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and by the precedent Rule the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute muſt be conſtrued favourably for Creditors.</p>
            <p>A Denizen of <hi>Ireland</hi> may be a Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt within the intent of the Statute.</p>
            <p>One born in a Ship on the Coaſt of <hi>Flanders,</hi> may be ſaid to be born in the Kings Dominions.</p>
            <p>If the Husband be an Alien, and the Wife a Subject; or the Wife an Alien, and the Husband a Subject; by Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> it's all one as to Goods, they are both within the Statute, but the Lands are the Kings. Yet I cannot conceive, that if an Alien marry a Subject Woman, of a great Fortune, that he can be within the Statute, for he is no Subject nor De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizen; and in ſuch caſe I never heard of a naturalization by an Apron-ſtring.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:34031:36"/>But by the Proviſo in 21 <hi>Jac. c.</hi> 19.<note place="margin">Alien<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Denizen.</note> That Act, and all other Acts made againſt Bankrupts ſhall extend to Aliens, and they ſhall be ſubject to the Laws as Bankrupts, and capable of the benefit as Creditors.</p>
            <p>Note 3. When the Commiſſion is to be ſued out, and the effect of it; by the Statute 21 <hi>Jac.</hi> It is provided, that no Purchaſer, for good and valuable conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, ſhall be impeached by vertue of any of the Statutes of Bankrupts, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Commiſſion to prove him or her a Bankrupt, he ſued forth againſt ſuch Bankrupt, within five years after he or ſhe ſhall become a Bankrupt. In o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Caſes I find no time limited for the taking out the Commiſſion; tho' its with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt the ſooner the better for the Creditors. <hi>Vide poſtea Tit.</hi> Settlement, Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers; and the Proviſo, that the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion muſt be ſued within five years after ſome time when he became a Bankrupt, 1 <hi>Keb. 12. Bradford &amp; Bludworth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Note 4. From what time the Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupcy ſhall commence, per Stat. 21 <hi>Jac. c. 19. If any ſuch Trader</hi> (as aforeſaid) <hi>being Arreſted for one hundred pounds, or more, of just Debt or Debts, ſhall after ſuch Arreſt eſcape out of Priſon, or procure his Enlargement by Common or Hired Bail; he ſhall be adjudged a Bankrupt from the time of his firſt Arrest.</hi> Alſo by the ſaid Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:34031:37"/>
               <hi>If ſuch Trader, being indebted unto any perſon or perſons in the ſum of</hi> 100 l. <hi>or more, ſhall not pay, or otherwiſe compound for the ſame within ſix Months next after the ſame ſhall grow due, and the Debtor be arreſted for the ſame, he ſhall be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged a Bankrupt from the time of his ſaid firſt Arreſt.</hi> For the Statute ſaith in the ſaid Caſes of Arreſt, or lying in Priſon.</p>
            <p>But the Statute doth not mention in the Caſe of Eſcape. Yet I conceive it is within the intention, the eſcaping being a more notorious offence than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Per Stat. 21 Jac.</hi> A man is only a Bankrupt by relation from the time of his Arreſt; when he makes an eſcape, or comes out upon Common Bail.</p>
            <p>A Merchant is impriſoned, and after becomes a Debtor to <hi>A,</hi> and then the ſix Months paſs, <hi>A</hi> is relievable as a Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, for he is not a Bankrupt by relation, <hi>per</hi> Mr. <hi>Stone,</hi> p. 182.</p>

did become a Bankrupt within all, or ſome of the Statutes made concerning Bankrupts; and accordingly we declare him to he a Bankrupt, and to have been ſo from that time.</p>
               <p>But the Commiſſioners are generally cautious in declaring the Bankrupcy from a certain time, but leave it to a Trial at Law, in caſe there be any Queſtion or Doubt of it; and this for their own ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity againſt Actions that may be brought againſt them.</p>
               <p>Note. The declaring of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners whether he be a Bankrupt or not, doth not acquit him or charge him, unleſs in truth it were ſo. 2 <hi>Siderfin,</hi> 176.</p>
               <p>Then let the Commiſſioners iſſue out their Inhibition to all perſons who are, or have been Debtors to the Bankrupt, or have had dealings with him, or have any of his Goods and Effects in their hands, not to pay any of their Debts, or deliver any of the Goods to him, or his Order.

               <p>AS to Interrogatories, they are to be framed according to the matters to be examined to; tho' ſome will have ready all the general Interrogatories that will fit the Examinations throughout all the Statutes.

Beſides, at a Trial, Depoſitions may be made uſe of as Evidence (eſpecially againſt the party himſelf, or in caſe of the Death of Witneſſes) and to read a Depoſition without referring to Interrogatories, is to judge upon an Anſwer without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtate of the Queſtion.

A. becomes a Bankrupt before he hath a Son: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Commiſſioners may ſell theſe Lands, and make to the Purchaſer a Good Eſtate? I hold they may; for
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:34031:64"/>
tho' A. be not Tenant in Tail, but bare Tenant for Life, yet the words in the Statute being <hi>the Bargain and Sale ſhall be good againſt all and every other perſon and perſons whomſoever, whom the Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt by Common Recovery or otherwiſe might cut off and debar from any Remainder, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, Rent, Profit, Title or Poſſibility:</hi> It ſeems this Bargain and Sale ſhall be good. For A. the Father, before Iſſue, by his bare Feoffment might deſtroy the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent Eſtate, as it is in <hi>Archer</hi>'s Caſe. But were the Settlement made ſo as to ſupport the contingent Remainder (as is uſully done) ſo that the Father could by no means debar it by any act he could do, then it would make a greater Queſtion; and yet if the Commiſſioners could not ſell in ſuch caſe, as Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments<note place="margin">Voluntary Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement.</note> are generally made now; the Act in this Point might be eaſily eluded. (This is to be underſtood of voluntary Settlements.)</p>
               <p>A Man makes a Leaſe of certain Lands to A. B. for three Lives to begin after the death of J. S. if the three Lives ſhall ſo long live. A. B. becomes a Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt. This Leaſe to A. B. is but a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,<note place="margin">Poſſibility.</note> for J. S. may ſurvive all the three Lives, and ſo it is a thing not grantable. Yet I think the Commiſſioners may ſell this within the intent of theſe words; for tho' A. B. cannot properly grant this, yet it is ſuch a thing as he may forfeit or extinguiſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="tcp:34031:65"/>A. is Tenant in Tail, Remainder to B. in Tail. B. becomes a Bankrupt, A makes a Feoffment in Fee and dies, and the Commiſſioners ſell theſe Lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore B. hath recovered in a Formedon, who ſhall bring the Formedon? Or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Act doth veſt the Eſtate in the Purchaſer, that he may enter, and have Ejectment? I hold that this Sale is good; for tho' the Remainder Man claims no Eſtate under the Bankrupt, yet the Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt by Common Recovery might have barred him; and the Act ſaith ſuch Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains and Sales ſhall be good, and the Aſſignee ſhall bring a Formedon.</p>
               <p>A Bankrupt commits Felony, the Land ſhall not Eſcheat, but the Commiſſioners<note place="margin">Eſcheat.</note> may ſell it; this is to be underſtood of a Common Lord.</p>
               <p>If one Bargain and Sell his Land, and<note place="margin">Bargain and Salo, and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainor becomes a Bankrupt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Inrollment.</note> before Inrollment becomes a Bankrupt, this Land may not be ſold by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, according to the Rule put be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by <hi>Jones:</hi> But if he makes a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a Letter of Attorney to give Livery, and then becomes a Bankrupt before the Seiſm delivered, theſe Lands in ſuch caſe may be ſold, <hi>B.

The reaſon of the difference is, in the firſt Caſe the Bargainee is in by the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain and Sale, and not by the Inroll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the Bankrupt could not by his own Act defeat this; but no Eſtate in the other Caſe paſſeth at all till the

               <p>This Clauſe is to be underſtood of ſuch Lands which deſcend or revert to him, and which were in a remote poſſibility of ever hapning.

They cannot execute it themſelves, neither can they put in a Deputy.

               <p>2.

               </p>
               <p>The Commiſſioners of Bankrupts have power to Sell, Grant and Aſſign, but they cannot bring an Action; their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignees muſt bring all Actions, <hi>Mod.

            <p>The Court declared, that the Eſtate belonging to the Joint-Trade, as alſo the the Debts due from the ſame, ought to be divided into moieties, and that each moiety of the Eſtate ought to be char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the firſt place with a moiety of the ſaid Joint-Debts; and if there be enough to pay all the Debts belonging to Joint-Trade, with an overplus, then ſuch overplus ought to applied to pay the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Debts of each Partner; but if ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient

               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> Where <hi>Allen</hi> in the Bill of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment<note place="margin">Indictment, for that the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery decreed Lands after Judgment at Law.</note> ſetteth forth, that he had two Judgments for his Debt in the Common Pleas, before the Suit in Chancery be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun, which Judgments he ſuppoſeth to be called into Examination by this Suit and Decree in Chancery againſt him, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Laws and Statutes.</p>
               <p>To this it is anſwered, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That theſe Judgments were not alledged by <hi>Allen</hi> in his own Bill againſt <hi>Edwards</hi> in Chancery, nor in his Anſwer to <hi>Edwards</hi> Bill, nor in any Replication, Rejoinder, Depoſition, Report or Motion in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery; neither were they ſo much as ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of or informed to any Councel or others, and there is no Order in Chance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry concerning thoſe Judgments.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> That theſe Judgments to be a year after <hi>Edwards</hi> became a Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, for he was Bankrupt <hi>Primo Jacobi,</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:34031:111"/>
and the Judgments wore <hi>Secundo Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That theſe Judgments ſtand in force againſt the Bankrupts Body, or any Lands or Goods which he ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards obtain, and were not diſpoſed by the Commiſſioners.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Allen</hi> himſelf ſued out the Commiſſion of Bankrupt with other Creditors, and was firſt named in the Petition to the Lord Chancellor for getting the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and attended in perſon in executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Commiſſion at all meetings, by which he himſelf did decline from the ſtrength of his Judgments, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himſelf to be ordered by the Commiſſioners for his Debt before any Suit in Chancery begun.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> Where <hi>Allen</hi> by his Bill of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment ſuppoſeth his Freehold to be drawn in queſtion in the Chancery, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Statute in <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> it is to be anſwered, that albeit Freeholds<note place="margin">Freehold Lands ordered in Chancery upon Equity, where the Common Law cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</note> have been always ordered in Chancery upon Equity, where the Common Law cannot help the Parties, yet in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Caſe it is to be obſerved, that <hi>Allen</hi> himſelf was firſt Plaintiff in the Chancery, and did draw in queſtion the Freehold which then was in Alderman <hi>Boles</hi> his Son by a Mortgage forfeited, for which Freehold to be conveyed to himſelf, he obtained the Decree in Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery, and had it conveyed accordingly
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:34031:112"/>
upon matter of Equity (<hi>viz.</hi>) becauſe there was but 30 <hi>l.</hi> unpaid of the Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage Mony.</p>
               <p>Therefore if the Chancery did well when it dealt with the Freehold for <hi>Allen;</hi> why ought not the Chancery upon a new Matter of Equity, make Decree againſt <hi>Allen</hi> to depart with the ſame Freehold again, when he would have Land worth 2400 <hi>l.</hi> to the defrauding of Creditors and poor Orphans, and in abuſe to the Commiſſioners of Bankrupts and Court of Chancery.</p>

J. E. were a Man that did ſeek or get his Living by Buying and Selling, and that the ſaid J.

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:34031:147"/>
the ſaid Surmiſes and Allegations were true, yet the ſaid Complainants, of their own ſhewing, ought not thereupon to be relieved either in Law or Equity; for this Defendant ſaith, that the ſaid Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, by vertue of the ſaid Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, had not any thing to do with any of this Defendants ſaid Leaſes, neither were the ſame Leaſes any way ſubject to the ſaid Commiſſion, for that it appeareth of the Complainants own ſhewing, that the ſaid Leaſes were made for good conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Mony, paid long before the ſaid J. E. did become a Bankrupt (that is to ſay) the ſaid firſt Leaſe made by the ſaid J. E. unto this ſaid Defendant, and the Redemiſe thereupon made by this Defendant to the ſaid J. E. were both made in conſideration of 240 <hi>l.</hi> paid by this Defendant to the ſaid J. E. to ſecure unto him this Defendant, the ſum of 30 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> out of the Meſuages or Tenements thereby Demiſed for 21 years. And the ſaid later Leaſes, as it appears of the Complainants own ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was made after a forfeiture of the Redemiſe made by this Defendant to the ſaid J.

                  <pb n="263" facs="tcp:34031:147"/>
1624. and in the <hi>22th</hi> Year, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant then could not prognoſticate that the ſaid J. E. would become a Bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt in <hi>December</hi> 1626. which was two Years and ſix Months after the making of the ſaid Leaſe and Redemiſe; for which cauſe, and becauſe it appeareth of the Complainants own ſhewing, that the ſaid Leaſe and Redemiſe were made for the conſideration of 240 <hi>l.</hi> and to ſecure to this Defendant 30 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> for 21 Years, and were made two Years and ſix Months before the ſaid J. E. did become a Bankrupt: And becauſe the Complainants by their Bill do ſet forth a good Title both in Law and Equity to this Defendant, of, and in the Meſuages, Lands and Tenements in queſtion, but do not ſhew nor derive to themſelves any Title at all thereunto, either in Law or Equity, neither by Grant nor Aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Commiſſioners, nor o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; therefore this Defendant doth Demur, and abide in Law upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of the ſaid Bill, and doth humbly demand Judgment of this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Court, if he, this Defendant, ſhall be compelled to make any anſwer thereunto. And for further Cauſe of Demurrer to the ſaid Inſufficient Bill, this Defendant ſaith, That the Title ſet forth by the Complainant by their ſaid Bill to the Leaſes in queſtion, or to the Lands, Tenements or Hereditaments
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:34031:148"/>
thereby Demiſed, is no good Title in Law or Equity. For if it be true, That the Commiſſioners, upon theſe Statutes of Bankrupts, did Aſſign and Appoint the Complainants to pay and tender un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Defendant the ſum of 240 <hi>l.</hi> with Intereſt, and in ſuch manner as by the ſaid Bill is ſuggeſted; and Aſſign and Appoint them to take from this Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant an Aſſignment or Conveyance of the Leaſes made to this Defendant of the Lands in the Bill mentioned, to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and behoof of the Complainants, and of the other Creditors of the ſaid J.

Honourable Court, if he, this Defendant, ſhall be compelled to make any anſwer thereunto. And for Plea in Bar to this ſaid Bill, this Defendant ſaith, That the ſaid J.
