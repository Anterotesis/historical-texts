            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:18093:3"/>
thirdly, what good wee haue by Chriſts Paſſion, and how wee ſhould meditate thereon. That the Treatiſe may be to the glory of God, I beſeech you let vs ioyne in heartie prayer vnto God.</p>

            <div type="treatise">
               <p>THe bloudy and bitter Paſſion of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, God and man, in the ſixe and twentith, and ſeauen and twentith Chapters of S. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> is largely and comfortably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſed. How he was betraied by <hi>Iudas</hi> with a kiſſe, accuſed of the Iewes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned vnder <hi>Pontius Pilate,</hi> and cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified betweene two Malefactors; his Soule being troubled; his Heart grieued; and his Body tormented with the nay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his bleſſed Hands and Feet, with the piercing of his gracious Side, vvith the ſhedding of his moſt glorious and precious Bloud. So the Sonne of God, the Lord of Glory, the Prince of Peace, was entreated of miſerable Miſcreants. So hee, which knew no ſinne, was made a ſacrifice for our ſinne. Now if the Vaile
<pb facs="tcp:18093:4"/>
of the Temple did rend aſunder from the toppe to the bottome; if the Graues did open, &amp; the bodies of Saints (which ſlept) aroſe; if the Earth did tremble and the ſtones claue aſunder when this vvas done; how can it be but that we ſhould be moued when this is preached? Our Hearts may tremble to thinke of it, ſo may our Tongues to ſpeake of it, yet we may reioyce in Chriſt crucified, that by the vertue of his Paſſion our ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome is payed, our wounds healed, ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for our ſinne made; Death con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, Sathan ſubdued, Hell ouercome, Sinne killed, God pacified, and wee to him reconciled.</p>
               <p>And now to begin with thoſe things which went before his Croſſe: may wee not thinke his ſuffering was exceeding great, when he ſweat bloud? and that did Chriſt in mount Oliues, being in an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonie, kneeling downe deuoutely, and praying moſt earneſtly. It is an vſuall thing for a man in anguiſh to ſweat; but to ſweate bloud, and to ſweate it in ſuch abundance, that euen drops like bloud ſhould trickle from his Body vpon the
<pb facs="tcp:18093:4"/>
Ground, this is not an vſuall thing; this was a ſtrange thing; this was proper one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Chriſt; this declared griefe vnſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable, paine intollerable. And did Chriſt ſhed drops of bloud for our ſins, &amp; can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wee ſhed one teare for the ſame? O that my Head were a Well of water, and my Eyes a Fountaine of teares, that I might bewaile the vnthankfulneſſe of the world!</p>
               <p>The matter which hee had in hand, was waightie; the worke which hee had to accompliſh, was great; the conflict, ſtrong; the enemies, mighty; their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults many. The Worke was mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; the Conflict was with Sinne, with Death, with Sathan, with Hell, with the Law, and with the wrath of GOD. And would not thoſe enemies, ſo many in number, ſo mightie in power, ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to behold, make a man to feare, to tremble, and to ſweate? If Chriſt had beene meere man, he could not haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred with them: but being God and man, did encounter with them all, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came them all, lead them captiue all, and hath triumphed ouer them all, though
<pb facs="tcp:18093:5"/>
it coſt him drops of bloud, with ſtrong crying and teares. What ſay I drops of bloud? it coſt him more, that which was deareſt vnto him, his life, before he could bring vnder ſo mightie enemies as man had, and accompliſh ſo painfull a worke as Redemption is, and pacifie ſo great a perſon as is the moſt high, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie and euer-liuing God. O man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the drops of bloud which CHRIST did ſhed for thy ſake, for thy ſinne, for thy ſoule, and for thy ſaluation: loue him for it; thanke him for it; ſerue him for it all the dayes of thy life. And thus much for the ſuffering of Chriſt in Mount Oliues.</p>
               <p>Secondly, wee may conceiue his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering was exceeding great, when being ſorrowfull and grieuouſly troubled, hee ſaid: <hi>My Soule is heauy euen vnto death.</hi> When hee fell on his Face, and prayed thrice: <hi>O my Father, if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſſe from mee;</hi> meaning his bitter Paſſion: not that he was vnwilling to take it (for, in all things he ſubmitted himſelfe to his heauenly Father) but thoſe earneſt ſpeeches declared the
<pb facs="tcp:18093:5"/>
heauy burden of ſinne, which lighted on him, the painefull griefe which hee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured, the grieuous paine which he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, the great torments, and terrours which hee ſuſtained for our ſakes. The ſoule of Chriſt was from heauen heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, neuer beſpotted with any vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but pure without corruption not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding it was heauie, and touched with the feare of death, in conſideration of our ſinne, which had deſerued death, with an infinite number of miſeries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, all which lighted vpon that inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Lambe; (which neuer diſpleaſed God, nor offended man) that by his ſtripes wee might be healed. And what an hell thinke we was Chriſt in, when he prayed thriſe moſt feruently, to haue that bitter Cuppe paſſe from him? No doubt hee felt the waight of ſinne, the Wrath of God againſt it, the Iuſtice of God requiring puniſhment for it, the power of the Law pronouncing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to it, the force of Death, the tyranny of Sathan, the torments of Hell, which no tongue can expreſſe, nor heart conceiue. And this made Chriſt to ſay
<pb facs="tcp:18093:6"/>
in anguiſh of Spirit: <hi>My Soule is very heauie euen vnto the death.</hi> And to pray three times; <hi>O my Father, if it be poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, let this cup paſſe from me:</hi> yet to ſhew that therefore hee came into the world, and that he was content to dye, hee ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted his will to Gods, ſaying; <hi>Neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe, not as I will, but as thou wilt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, he was betrayed by one of his owne, <hi>Iudas</hi> by name; a Iudas in hart, a Iudas in tongue, a Iudas in deed, came to him with a Iudas kiſſe, ſaying; <hi>Haile Maſter,</hi> and betrayed Chriſt. O beaſtly traiterous Beaſt, to betray thy Maſter, and that vnder colour of friendſhip with a kiſſe. I ſay, to betray thy Maſter, whom thou waſt bound to defend, and ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to haue loued. It was too much for any Barbarian to haue done: but for thee which didſt call him Maſter, vvhich didſt beare his Bagge, which didſt ſit at his Table, which waſt conuerſant vvith him, to doe it, was a Iudas tricke, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede, too-too traiterous, ſhamefull and beaſtly. But what will not the deſire of money doe? <hi>What will you giue me</hi> (ſaid IVDAS) <hi>and I will deliuer him vnto you?</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18093:6"/>
I will deliuer him vnto you: but firſt I muſt know what you will giue me. <hi>Iudas</hi> tooke part with the Iewes, <hi>Iudas</hi> betraied Chriſt, <hi>Iudas</hi> damned himſelfe, and all for what will you giue me? But what did his money him good, when he had loſt Chriſt, loſt Heauen, loſt his Soule, and damned himſelfe? But was this the end of this? When <hi>Iudas</hi> ſaw he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, he repented himſelfe, he brought againe the thirtie pieces of ſiluer to the chiefe Prieſts and Elders, he ſaid, <hi>I haue ſinned, betraying the innocent bloud:</hi> he caſt downe the ſiluer pieces in the temple, he departed, and went and hanged himſelfe. Hanging was the end of <hi>Iudas:</hi> a fit end for ſuch a traitor: but that is not all, he hangs in hell perpetually for it, and he is ſerued as he deſerued, moſt iuſtly: for bloud will haue bloud. But did <hi>Iudas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent? ſo is the text, <hi>He repented, and he ſaid; I haue ſinned, betraying the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud.</hi> He did not repent truely, for then hee would not haue hanged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. The word Repentance was in his mouth, but the thing vvas not in his heart: within him was a tormenting
<pb facs="tcp:18093:7"/>
conſcience, which did accuſe, iudge, and condemne him, which did ſet before his eyes, the haynouſneſſe of his fact, the grieuouſneſſe of GODS Wrath, Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without mercy, Hell-fire without redemption: This deſperate minde made him to depart from the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, to take an halter, and hang himſelfe. See the force of Conſcience in <hi>Iudas: Mala conſcientia delictorum noſtrorum te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis, iudex, tortor, carcer, accuſat, iudicat, condemnat.</hi> An euill conſcience is a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, a Iudge, a tormentor, a priſon of our ſinnes; it doth accuſe, iudge, and condemne.</p>
               <p>What thing more grieuous, then day and night to carry about ſuch a witneſſe, Iudge, Tormenter, and priſon? <hi>Omnia poteſt homo fugere praeter cor ſuum: Nam quocunque vadit, conſcientia eum non dere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquit.</hi> A man may auoide all things but his owne heart; for whither-ſoeuer hee goeth, it goeth with him, either to excuſe or accuſe, which are the effects of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. The teſtimonie of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is a precious iewell, and (as <hi>Salc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaith) <hi>a continuall feaſt,</hi> becauſe it
<pb facs="tcp:18093:7"/>
maketh a man alwayes merry. The put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting away of a good conſcience cauſeth ſhipwracke of faith, as in <hi>Himenaeus</hi> and <hi>Alexander.</hi> Happy, therefore is he which can truly ſay with that elect veſſel S. <hi>Paul, Herein I endeuour my ſelfe to haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way a cleare conſcience towards God, and towards men: for if our heart condemne vs, GOD is greater then our heart, and knoweth all things; but if our heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne vs not, then haue wee boldneſſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, and whatſoeuer we aske in faith we receiue of him.</hi> A ſicke conſcience can no Phyſitian in the world cure, but that heauenly Phyſitian Chriſt Ieſu: to him therefore let vs reſort with all humilitie.</p>
               <p>But to <hi>Iudas</hi> againe: <hi>What will you giue me, and I will deliuer him vnto you?</hi> The deſire of money is the roote of all miſchiefe. They which are poyſoned with it doe erre from the Faith. They pierce themſelues through with many ſorrowes: they fall into temptations, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſnares, into many fooliſh and noiſome luſts which drowne men in perdition and deſtruction. But men of God muſt flie thoſe things and follow after righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe,

godlineſſe, faith, loue, patience, meekeneſſe, laying hold of eternall life, whereunto they are called. By the end of <hi>Iudas</hi> let Seruants take heede that they betray not their Maiſters: for trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and rebellion moſt commonly haue a ſhamefull end; ſuch is Gods iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Let Maſters alſo beware, that they truſt not euery ſeruant too farre, no not though he be of his houſhold, and pretend good-will, and ſeeme truſty; euen ſo did <hi>Iudas,</hi> yet was hee in truth, but a ſeemer, a diſſembler, a traitor. For, as there is no griefe to that of the minde, no loſſe to that of life, no feare to that of deſtruction; ſo is there no ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie to a diſſembling friend, no treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to that which one of a mans owne may practiſe.</p>
               <p>Here is <hi>Iudas</hi> for an example: one of Chriſts Apoſtles, and of his houſhold (as I may ſay) one that asked, <hi>Maſter, is it I?</hi> one that kiſſed him, and ſeemed as truſty as any the reſt: yet for all that he was but a Iudas, a halter, a cloaker, a diſſembler, a traitor. All is not honie that is ſweet, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is all gold that gliſters; ſo is not
<pb facs="tcp:18093:8"/>
euery one a true ſeruant that ſaith, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. <hi>Iudas</hi> was a double fellow, hee had one queſtion to Chriſt, another to the Iewes: to Chriſt, <hi>Maſter, is it I?</hi> but to the Iewes, <hi>what will you giue me, and I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer him vnto you?</hi> This queſtion of <hi>Iudas</hi> for the firſt part is very rife in the world at theſe dayes: I will doe you a pleaſure, but what wil you giue me for my paines? I will lend you a ſumme, but what will you giue me for intereſt? I will let you a piece of land, but what will you giue me for a good fine? Hee that will giue moſt ſhall haue it: ſo all is, what will you giue me, and little without what will you giue me. But let them vſe it as long as they will, it is but <hi>Iudas</hi> his queſtion; Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an charitie asketh no ſuch queſtion, and yet is ready to pleaſure and to lend. And thus much for the treacherie of <hi>Iudas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will omit, for breuities ſake, many circumſtances, as that all his Diſciples forſooke him, and fled like cowards when they ſaw ſwords and ſtaues againſt him; that <hi>Caiaphas</hi> the hie prieſt accuſed him of blaſphemy, that the people ſpat on him, and ſmote him with rods, that
<pb facs="tcp:18093:9"/>
                  <hi>Peter</hi> denied him with a lie, with an othe, with a curſe. I come to <hi>Pontius Pilate</hi> the Gouernour. This man though hee knew well, that for enuy they had deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered him, though his Wife ſent vnto him vpon the Iudgement ſeate, to haue nothing to doe with that iuſt man, though hee found no cauſe of death in him; yet like a naughty man, and time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Iudge, he let goe an arrant Theefe, <hi>Barrabas,</hi> and deliuered Ieſus to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, &amp; then before the multitude tooke water and waſhed his hands, ſaying; <hi>I am innocent of the bloud of that iuſt man.</hi> He confeſſed him a iuſt man: why then did he giue ſentence on him? He ſaid he was innocent of his bloud, and yet did conſent to ſhed it. No, no, <hi>Pilate</hi> was guiltie of Chriſts death, and could not ſhift himſelfe of it by taking water and waſhing his hands. What a matter was this, <hi>Barrabas</hi> to be preferred before Chriſt? a murtherer let goe and an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent perſon ſcourged? But ſee enuie: they enuied Chriſts vertues. <hi>Inuidia eſt virtutis comes.</hi> If <hi>Pilate</hi> had beene a good man, finding no cauſe of death in Chriſt, hee
<pb facs="tcp:18093:9"/>
would haue ſtoode with him to death, &amp; not for feare, or any other carnal reſpect haue condemned him. After the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers tooke him in the common hal, firſt they ſtripped him, then they put about him a robe of ſcarlet, on his head they ſet a crowne of thornes in his right hand they put a reede before him, they bowed their knees, in mockage, ſaying, <hi>Auc rex Iudaeorum:</hi> Afterward they ſpit on him, and with a reed ſmote him on the head. Thus when they had mocked him, they tooke the rode from him, and put his owne rayment on him, and led him away to be crucified. What villany was this? Chriſt being God could haue ſtaid their fury, yea, haue ſtriken them ſtarke dead with a word: but hee would not for our ſakes. If thoſe ſouldiers had knowne what they did, with whom they dealt, whoſe ſonne he was, from whence he came, and whither hee would, what power he had, they would haue ſtaied themſelues: but being full of ignorance, they did what they did. For had they knowne, they would not haue crucified the Lord of glory. But yet ignorance excuſed not.
<pb facs="tcp:18093:10"/>
For ignorance in thoſe which would not vnderſtand, without doubt is a ſinne: Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in thoſe which could not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, is a puniſhment for ſin: neither is excuſable; both are damnable. We haue heard what Chriſt ſuffered before hee came to his croſſe, that he ſweat drops of bloud in mount Oliues, that being ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull he prayed earneſtly to haue that bitter cuppe paſſe from him, that he was betraied by <hi>Iudas</hi> with a kiſſe, that hee was forſaken of all his Diſciples, that he was accuſed by <hi>Caiaphas</hi> for a blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that he was denied by <hi>Peter</hi> thrice, that hee was condemned vnder <hi>Pontius Pilate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It followeth that I ſpeake of his ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring on the croſſe. Chriſt being on the croſſe ſuffered reproch of the paſſers by, of the Prieſtes, Scribes, and Phariſes, and of the Theeues. The paſſers by wagging their heades, reuiled him, ſaying: Thou that deſtroyedſt the temple of God, and buildedſt it in three dayes; if thou be the Son of God, come down from the croſſe. Likewiſe the Prieſts, Scribes, Elders, and Phariſes mocked him, ſaying, He ſaued
<pb facs="tcp:18093:10"/>
others, but himſelfe can he not ſaue: if hee be the King of Iſrael, let him come downe from the croſſe, and wee will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue him. The theeues alſo doth at the firſt, caſt the ſame thing in his teeth. Chriſt indeede ſaid: deſtroy this Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in three dayes I will raiſe it vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. The Iewes miſtooke him: they meant that great temple in Hieruſalem, which had beene a building fortie and ſixe yeeres: but he meant the Temple of his body, that after they had deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, mangled, and killed it, he would raiſe it from death the third day, as in truth he did. Now if they had vnderſtoode him, they would neuer haue mocked him with that ſaying: but ſeeing him to riſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, haue confeſſed him to be the Son of God. The wicked Prieſts, Scribes and Phariſes mocked him ſaying: <hi>hee ſaued others, but he cannot ſaue himſelfe: If he be the King of Iſrael, let him come downe from the croſſe, and we will beleeue him.</hi> Chriſt indeed ſaued others, all, that beleeued in him, from the guilt of ſinne, from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall death, from the tiranny of Sathan, from the curſe of the law, from the wrath
<pb facs="tcp:18093:11"/>
of God. Himſelfe alſo he ſaued, in that he got the victory, and roſe againe the third day: but theſe blinde prieſts, Scribes and Phariſes, vnderſtoode not this, and therefore they mocked him with it.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, Chriſt could haue come downe from the croſſe if he would, but he knew it not to be expedient. He would not yeeld to their fancies, if he had come down, they would haue beleeued him ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a whit the ſooner: ſome would haue ſaid he did it for feare of death: ſome to ſhew what he could doe: ſome for one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, ſome for an other. And therefore CHRIST knowing this, yeelded not vnto them, but went forward with the worke he had in hand, which was by his croſſe to appeaſe the wrath of God, to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie his iuſtice, to make him fauorable vnto ſinners, by offering a full and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſacrifice once for all: and therefore he is a prieſt, not according to the order of <hi>Aaron,</hi> which by imperfection did need a ſucceſsiue, but according to the order of <hi>Melchiſedec,</hi> and that for euer.</p>
               <p>To proceede: from the ſixt houre to the ninth, there was darknes ouer all the
<pb facs="tcp:18093:11"/>
land, for the Sunne was darkned. About the ninth houre Ieſus cried with aloude voice, <hi>Ely, Ely, lamaſabacthany.</hi> My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken mee? Behold the Paſſion of Chriſt. He cried, with aloude voice he cried, vnto heauen he cried, as one forlorne he cried: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? No tongue can expreſſe, nor heart conceiue the pangs, the paines, the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment which he ſuffered. For the time the paines of the damned, the torments of hell fell vpon him, which wee for our ſinnes had deſerued, and ſhould haue ſuffered for euer and euer in hell, had not he ſo ſuffered on the croſſe. What terror was this to behold, man in his fall, God in his wrath, ſinne in his deſert, the law in his curſe, the diuell in his tyranny, hell in his torments? What terrour was this? God in his wrath is a conſuming fire: man in his fall is a loſt caſt-away: ſinne in his deſert is a damnable thing: the law in his curſe is a heauy thunderbolt: the diuell in his rage is very terrible: hell in his torments is intolerable. And what a terrour was this? Theſe things Chriſt
<pb facs="tcp:18093:12"/>
did behold, nay did ſuffer, and the paine did make him crie aloude: My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? not that God forſooke Chriſt at any time: but this ſpeech declared that conflict, that terrour, that torment, vvhich no creature beſide could haue endured. For it coſt more to redeeme ſoules, ſo that a man muſt let that alone for euer. Then moſt true is that article of our Creede: <hi>He deſcended into hell,</hi> for the time he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the paines of hell, together with the extreame ſhame, as the victory of ſorrowes, whileſt being held in the graue vntill the third day, he lay as it were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed of death. The vertue of his paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reacheth downe to hell, to redeeme mankinde from the paines of hell which hee had deſerued, to ouerthrow Sathan the prince of hell, to diſſolue his workes which are ſinne, and death, to deliuer mankinde which are vnder his ſubiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to purchaſe for him Gods fauour, forgiuenes of ſinnes, and eternall life. Chriſt on the croſſe offered vp his ſoule and body a ſacrifice to ſaue our ſoules and bodies. On the croſſe hee ſuffered
<pb facs="tcp:18093:12"/>
in ſoule and body to make ſatisfaction for our ſinnes committed in ſoule and body. And the ſuffering in both was ſo great, that he cried aloude, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> In that he ſaid, my God, with a repetition, hee aſſured himſelfe ſtill of his fauour, of his protection, and of deliuerance: by that ſpeech he deſpaired not, but expreſſed the greateſt ſorrow, the heauieſt paine that could be endured, for the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankinde. We haue heard what a notable ſacrifice Chriſt offered on the croſſe, not the bloud of goates or calues, but his owne bloud to purge our conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences from dead workes to ſerue the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing God. This is that ſacrifice which was figured by the Paſchall Lambe, by the braſen ſerpent lifted vp in the vvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, by the whole burnt ſacrifice, by the peace offering. A remembrance of this ſacrifice, is our co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of bread and wine, the one repreſenting Chriſts bodie rent, the other his bloud ſhed for our ſinnes. This is that ſacrifice whereby <hi>Abel, Noe, Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> all the faithful Patriarchs and Prophets,
<pb facs="tcp:18093:13"/>
all the beleeuing perſons from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning were ſaued. For, Chriſt is the Lambe, ſlaine from the beginning of the world. Slaine in the figure, in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God, in the vertue of his paſſion from the beginning of the world. Then is Chriſt ſlaine to euery one, vvhen hee beleeueth him ſlaine. Ieſus Chriſt yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day and to day, the ſame for euer. From the beginning of the world to his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that is yeſterday, from his aſcenſion to the common reſurrection, that is to day, from the common reſurrection for euer he is one. Therefore one faith, one religion, one kinde of Sacraments in ſubſtance, one way to heauen from the beginning, one ſpirituall meate &amp; drink. Our fathers did all eate the ſame ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all meate vvhich vve eate, and drinke the ſame ſpirituall drink which we drink. They dranke of the Rocke which follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed them, and the rocke was Chriſt. For though they did eate Manna, and dranke water out of the rocke, yet the faithfull ſpiritually did feede on Chriſt: becauſe that viſible meate they vnderſtood ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually; they hungred after it ſpiritually,
<pb facs="tcp:18093:13"/>
they did taſte it ſpiritually, that vvith it they might be ſatisfied ſpiritually. And <hi>Bertramus</hi> ſaith, that our fathers did eate the ſelfe-ſame ſpirituall meate which we eate: becauſe one and the ſame Chriſt fed the people in the wilderneſſe with his fleſh, and refreſhed them with his bloud, and now feedeth the faithfull in the Church with the bread of his bodie, and refreſheth them with the vvater of his bloud. But what is it to eate the fleſh of Chriſt? It is to reſt vpon him vvith a ſure truſt, by his grace ſpirit, preſence, to be fed, nouriſhed, ſuſteined to eternall life Or as Chriſt himſelfe ſaith: He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my bloud, abideth in mee, and I in him. To eate the fleſh of Chriſt, and drinke his blood, is to abide in Chriſt, and to haue Chriſt abiding in vs. And therefore S. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ſaith, hee that abides not in Chriſt, and in whom Chriſt abideth not, eateth not ſpiritually the fleſh of Chriſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though viſibly and carnally he preſſeth with his teeth the Sacrament of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and bloud of Chriſt: but rather ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the ſacrament of ſo great a thing to
<pb facs="tcp:18093:14"/>
his condemnation. Whereby it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare that we at this day preach the ſelfe ſame Goſpell which was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the vvorld, that is, vvee preach Chriſt crucified, which was opened to our firſt father in paradiſe, renewed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and all the Patriarchs, figured by all the ſacrifices of the Law, witneſſed by the Prophets, pointed vnto by <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> preached by Ieſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and deliuered by his Apoſtles. And therefore it is moſt true, ancient, catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and apoſtolike.</p>
               <p>Now to the things vvhich hapned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the time of his paſſion: the graues did open: the dead bodies which ſlept aroſe: the vaile of the temple did rent in twaine from the top to the bottome: the earth did tremble: the ſtones did cleaue aſunder. Theſe things declared that a notable perſon ſuffered, yet the Iewes were not touched. Theſe vnſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures were moued, yet the Iewes hearts were hardned. The Centurion, when hee ſaw what was done, glorified God, ſaying: Of a ſuretie this man was iuſt. The ſouldiers that watched him,
<pb facs="tcp:18093:14"/>
when they ſaw the earth quake, and the things that were done, feared greatly, ſaying: Truely this was the Son of God. A confeſsion to the glory of God, to the comfort of themſelues, to the prouing of a Sauiour, and to the terror of the Iewes. This man whom yee haue contemned, whom ye haue condemned, whom yee haue reuiled, whom yee haue ſcourged, whom ye haue crucified, truely was the Sonne of God. The renting of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the quaking of the earth, the clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of the ſtones, the opening of the graues, the riſing of the dead, doe proue, that truely he was the Sonne of God, and without all doubt a iuſt man. A iuſt man indeed: For in his heart was neuer euil thoght; out of his mouth neuer pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded euill word; with his body he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wrought ill deede: but in heart hee was alwaies tender and louing, in word gentle and meeke, in dealing iuſt and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right. Yet was he accuſed, condemned, and put to a moſt ſhamefull death, the death of the croſſe, as a moſt notorious malefactour. And all this was done to worke the worke of mans redemption.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:18093:15"/>Here come in certaine queſtions. The firſt is, whether Chriſt could haue deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe from their hands. The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere is, he could. For he is God omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent: but he did not, that the ſcriptures might be fulfilled, that our redemption might be made, that our ſaluation might be accompliſhed. The ſecond queſtion is, whether the Iewes were to be excuſed, ſeeing it was the good will of GOD that CHRIST ſhould die. The anſwere is, in no wiſe: Becauſe they did it of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, enuie and malice. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as good came thereby to mankind, that was to be aſcribed to Gods goodneſſe, which did turne their ſinne to a good end: <hi>Deus tam bonus eſt, vt ex malis eliciat bona.</hi> God is ſo good that he turnes euill to good. The third queſtion is, whether all they are damned which put Chriſt to death? I dare not ſo ſay, ſeeing Chriſt prayed for them: Father forgiue them, they know not what they doe. But this I ſay, whoſoeuer of them died, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeuing that perſon to be the Sonne of God, the onely Mediator betwixt God and Man, the onely redeemer, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer
<pb facs="tcp:18093:15"/>
of forgiuenes of ſinnes, the onely high prieſt of good things to come, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer I ſay departed out of this faith, is damned for euer and euer.</p>
               <p>I Proceede to the benefits, which we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy by Chriſt his paſſion, which are in number many, in feeling comfortable, in eſtimation moſt precious. The firſt is purgation of ſinnes. Thrice happy is he that hath it, moſt miſerable are they which haue it not. The penitent ſinner of a troubled ſpirit, of a broken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite heart, forſaking his owne waies, and renouncing his owne imagination, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing amendment, and purpoſing the fruits of repentance, confeſsing his own miſerie, and appealing to the mercies of God in the merits of Chriſt, haue their ſinnes, though as red as ſcarlet, yet wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in his moſt precious, gracious, and glorious bloud. For if the bloud of buls, and goates, and the aſhes of a heiffer, ſprinckling them that are vncleane, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth as touching the purifying of the fleſh: how much more ſhall the bloud of Chriſt, which through the eternall
<pb facs="tcp:18093:16"/>
ſpirit offred himſelfe without ſpot to God, purge your conſcience from dead workes, to ſerue the liuing God? And to this end are we deliuered from all our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, Sathan, ſinne, and death, that we ſhould ſerue Chriſt our deliuerer, &amp; that without feare, in holines and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe all the daies of our life.</p>
               <p>The 2. benefit is, remiſsion of ſinnes. Bleſſed is the man whoſe ſinnes are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuen, couered, and not imputed. Sinne is in the childe of God, but it reigneth not. Sinne is in the elect, but it is coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Sin is in the heires of ſaluation, but it is not imputed, becauſe it is forgiuen: as the Arke was couered with a golden ſheet called the <hi>propitiatorie:</hi> ſo Chriſt is the propitiation of our ſinnes, by whom we haue redemption through his bloud, euen forgiuenes of ſinnes. For the bloud of Chriſt crieth remiſſion of ſinnes in the hearts of the godly.</p>
               <p>The 3. benefit of Chriſts paſſion is, deliuerance from the curſe of the lawe. The law accuſeth, Chriſt excuſeth. The law terrifieth, Chriſt comforteth. The law curſeth, Chriſt bleſſeth. Chriſt hath
<pb facs="tcp:18093:16"/>
redeemed vs from the curſe of the law being made a curſe for vs. For it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Curſed is euery one that hangeth on the tree:</hi> that the bleſſing of <hi>Abraham</hi> might come on the <hi>Gentiles</hi> through faith; that we might receiue the adoption of ſons. For though we be blacke by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, yet are we white by grace: though blacke in <hi>Adam,</hi> yet white in Chriſt: though blacke by merite yet vvhite by mercie. For Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſnes to euery one that belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth. They then which in a liuely faith apprehend Chriſt crucified, and riſen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, haue what the law requireth, that is, perfect obedience performed of Chriſt imputed to them.</p>
               <p>The 4. benefit by Chriſts paſsion is, freedome from damnation. For what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction can come to them which are ingraffed into Chriſt the author of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation? How can the ſecond death take hold on them that haue their part in the firſt reſurrection, and are in Chriſt the life it ſelfe? the Deuill cannot pluck them away finall from God, which are written in the booke of life, and redeemed by the
<pb facs="tcp:18093:17"/>
blood of the Lambe. Hell cannot terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie them which patiently looke for an inheritance in heauen. There is no dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation (ſaith the Apoſtle) to them which are in Chriſt, which walke not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit. We are in Chriſt by election before the world was made: We are called to Chriſt by the word after the world was made: We are iuſtified by a liuely faith, the obedience of the Son of God being imputed to vs: We are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied through the ſpirit, our ſoules being purified in obeying the truth: We walke not after the fleſh, when we reſiſt coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous cogitations, ambitious deſires, vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous thoughts, enuious conceits, malitious purpoſes, and whatſoeuer els corruption of old <hi>Adam:</hi> We walke after the ſpirit, when we embrace loue, follow peace and holines, ſhew long-ſuffering, gentlenes, meeknes, temperance: cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the fleſh with the affections and luſts.</p>
               <p>The fift benefit by Chriſts paſsion, is, that the wrath of God is pacified. For as they which obey not the Son, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on
<pb facs="tcp:18093:17"/>
them: ſo they which beleeue in the Son haue euerlaſting life reſerued in heauen for them, which are kept by the power of God, through faith to ſaluation. <hi>This is my beloued Sonne, in whom I am well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, heare him.</hi> A voice from heauen, after Ieſus was baptized, the heauens being open vnto him, and the ſpirit of GOD deſcending like a Doue, and lighting on him. This borne of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> is my naturall, &amp; beloued Son, coequall to me, and coeternall, and conſubſtantiall with me, in whom, euen for his owne ſake I am well pleaſed with all my elect chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, my diſpleaſure being as farre from them, as the Eaſt from the Weſt, and my fauour vpon them euen for my Chriſt, for whoſe ſake I pardon all their offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and their ſinnes, and iniquities will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member no more, but will put my lawes in their mindes, and write them in their hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</p>
               <p>The ſixt benefit by CHRIST his paſſion, is victorie ouer Sathan. For where ſinne is purged, remitted, and not imputed, vvhere the malediction
<pb facs="tcp:18093:18"/>
of the Law is abrogated, where the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death is aboliſhed, where the wrath of God is pacified: there the Deuill hath naught. For Chriſt, through death, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed him which had the power of death, that is, the Deuill, that he might deliuer all them which for feare of death were al their life time ſubiect to bondage. Wherefore, though Sathan be yet ſuffred to tempt the children of God, yet hee ſhall neuer plucke them away from the ſtate of ſaluation: becauſe God is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and will not ſuffer his to be tempted aboue their ſtrength: but ſhall in the middes of temptation make a way that they may be able to beare it. Beſide theſe ſingular benefites by Chriſt his paſsion, wee haue by the ſame peace of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which paſſeth all vnderſtanding, acceſſe to grace by the mediation of Chriſt, and after this life euerlaſting, to behold the bleſſed and glorious Trinitie, in glorie, Maieſtie, and eternitie.</p>
               <p>Now to the meditation of Chriſt his paſsion, which we ſhall conſider fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if wee marke how fowle a thing ſinne is, how grieuous to the conſcience, how
<pb facs="tcp:18093:18"/>
diſpleaſant to God, what puniſhment it deſerued, whoſe death it procured, and ſo repent for the ſame.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if wee behold the paſsing loue of God in ſending his Sonne to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme vs, &amp; the ſingular loue of Chriſt, in laying downe his life for vs, and ſo be thankfull to both for the ſame. If God had redeemed mankinde by any other meanes, as by ſiluer or gold, or by force of armes, or any of his Angels, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit had been the leſſe: but he did it by the death of his holy and deare Sonne. A benefit of all benefits the greateſt, and neuer to be thought on without thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe. And in truth no Angel could be an attonement-maker betweene God &amp; man, becauſe they communicate nature neither with God nor man: but Chriſt Ieſus doth with both. For hee is God in nature, and man in nature: and ſo a friend to both God and man, and therefore a moſt fit perſon to make peace betweene God and man.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, we ſhal meditate on the paſſion of Chriſt aright, if after his example we forgiue our enemies when they offend
<pb facs="tcp:18093:19"/>
vs, if we loue them though they hate vs, if we pray for them, though they curſe vs, after the example of Chriſt, which forgaue vs when wee treſpaſſed againſt him, which ſo loued vs, that he died for vs when we were his enemies &amp; ſinners.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, we ſhall meditate on the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt aright, if we mortifie our members, which are vpon the earth, if we crucifie the fleſh with the affections, that is, by putting off the old man, which is corrupt through deceiueable luſts, and putting on the new man, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God is created vnto righteouſnes and true holineſſe, if we walke honeſtly; as in the day time, not in gluttony and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes, but in ſobrietie, neither in cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering and wantonneſſe, but in chaſtitie, neither in ſtrife and enuying, but in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: if wee put on the Lord Ieſus, and make no prouiſion for the fleſh, to fulfill the luſts of it. We may haue an honeſt care of our bodies, which is to feed them ſoberly, to cloth them decently, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe them moderately: but ſo to prouide for the fleſh as to fulfill the luſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſo to pamper it as to make it ouer-rule
<pb facs="tcp:18093:19"/>
the ſpirit, this is to forget Chriſts paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſeeke to crucifie him againe, to ſerue our enemie, from which to redeem vs Chriſt died, to deſtroy that (as much as in him is) vvhich Chriſt ſo deerely bought.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, we ſhal meditate on the paſsion of Chriſt aright, if wee ſtedfaſtly beleeue by it to be ſaued, and liue and die in true repentance for our ſinnes, which made a diuiſion betweene God and vs, vvhich brought the Sonne of God from heauen into the vaile of miſery, which cauſed the death of Ieſus Chriſt. The conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this ought to make our hearts to bleede, to flye from ſinne, as from a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſerpent, to renounce the diuell with his workes, as we promiſed in baptiſme, to be contrite, which is the firſt branch of true repentance, to crie for mercie, which is the ſecond, to truſt in Chriſt the mediator, which is the third, to endeuour with a purpoſe to ſerue the liuing GOD, which is the laſt. Then tho our ſins were as crimſon, they ſhall be made as vvhite as ſnow: though they were red as ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, they ſhall be as wool. For the bloud
<pb facs="tcp:18093:20"/>
of Ieſus Chriſt the Son of God, purgeth the penitent from all ſinne. Then God will be on our right hand for euer. Then ſhall the Realme flouriſh, as now, ſo for euer with peace, plenty, the preaching of the Goſpell, with many other godly bleſſings, to the glorie of God, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of vs, and terrour of the enemie.</p>
               <p>Let vs be thankefull to Almightie God for preſeruing vs hitherto, giuing vs peace, when others haue had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie: plentie, when others haue ſuffered ſcarſity: the preaching of the word, which others haue lacked: vnder the gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a moſt gracious King, whom we are bound, as the Lords annointed, to loue ſincerely, to reuerence dutifully, to obey heartily, to pray for zealouſly and continually, becauſe God hath vſed his Maieſtie as a meane to conuey ouer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs his mercies) that he may liue to the comming of Chriſt, to giue vp to him his princely crowne, to receiue of him a crown of glory for euer, in the kingdom of glorie, where is light and no darknes, life, and no dying, peace and no diſcord; where is mirth without mourning, fauor
<pb facs="tcp:18093:20"/>
without miſliking, knowledge vvithout ignorance, where is holines &amp; no ſinne, vprightnes and no hypocriſie, truth and no falſehood, perfection and no infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; where are ioyes which eye hath not ſeene, neither eare hath heard, neither hath entred into the heart of man, which the Lord hath prepared for them that loue him, in the company of godly Saints, in the ſight of heauenly Angels, in the preſence of Ieſus, the Mediator of the new Teſtament. To vvhom with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, be all honour and glorie for euer and euer.</p>
