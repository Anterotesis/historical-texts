            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>Vr Sauiour Iesus Christ, by the mouth of his holy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, hath now long agoe foretold that in these latter dayes many signes should appeare in the Sunne, Moone, Starres and Creatures aboue; and also before his second comming, many Miracles should heere be seene on earth below. Haue we not felt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and pestilence in those yeares by-past?
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:19431:3"/>
And doe wee not heare rumors of Warres euery day, and the rising of Nation against Nation throughout all Europe? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sects of Religion doe daily breake vp, to the ouerthrow of the simplicity and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of the Gospell, and offence of weake ones to stumble at? The Wicked in this respect may iustly tremble and quake, who neuer intend to breake off their sinnes by repentance, but putting off the euill day from them, lie wallowing in the puddle of their filthie pleasures, being past all feeling, are frozen in the dregges of the vnfruitfull workes of darkenesse: as contrarily the Elect haue matter to reioyce, and lift vp their heads, for the day of their Redemption draweth neere; For doth not daylie expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience teach vs the accomplishment of all the tokens which should precede the great day of the Lord? And now of late what a great blazing Starre looked downe vpon the Earth, out of the Firmament, porten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding no doubt some great alteration of state, and punishment by the Lords vsuall wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:19431:3"/>
of fire, sword and plague, of the stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne and obstinate rebellion of the wicked in so great a light of the Gospell? The Lord hath called of late sundry Princes and great Personages to their rest, from these trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some times: The rising of it inclining in the South-east ouer the House of Austria, and other partes vnder that Climate, hath brought such effusion of blood, murthering robbing, ransacking of Citties, Townes and Countries with it, which are ominous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages of greater and more fearefull euills to come. For all these things wee cease not to prouoke the holy One of Israel to wrath; yet God, who is rich in mercy, spreadeth forth the large beames of his fatherly boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifulnesse and goodnesse on the penitent, that either the vngodly may turne away from their euill waies, or then to make them inexcusable. Christ in the daies of his flesh wrought many Miracles, in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vncurable diseases, whereof the Lords recordes in the new Testament maketh mention aboundantly; for the which the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:19431:4"/>
godly and well disposed glorifieth the Lord, but others wickedly affected doe miscon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strue the action, imputing it to the work of Sathan, or else mocke and calumniate the same. The hand of the Lord is not shortned now among vs vpon whom the ends of the world is come.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Amers-ford</hi> in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> three miles distant from <hi>Vtrecht,</hi> an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary forme of visitation miraculously befell a young Maiden, named <hi>Elizabeth Goossens</hi> dwelling neere by the principall Church <hi>Saint George,</hi> whose father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are both yet aliue, honest and wel estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med persons, of good name and credit in the citie, his name is <hi>Goossen Cornelison Taets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The said Maiden in her infancy was stricken with lamenesse, that the Lord que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionlesse might manifest his power and goodnesse in her, and continued a criple 25. yeares, so that she could neyther goe, sit, nor stand, but was carryed hither and thither by the helpe of others wheresoeuer her bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse was, which all the inhabitants of the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:19431:4"/>
Citie can faithfully witnesse: wherefore to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end of the foresaid yeares, shee could not for the space of 28. weekes eate or taste any thing to any purpose, but continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in prayers and supplications night and day, repeating these words: <hi>Thou Sonne of Dauid, Creator of heauen and earth, receiue mee into thy Kingdome, or else giue me patience and comfort in this my heauy and pittifull disease.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherefore, behold what an vnexpected reliefe was sent vnto her: For this present yeare, 1619 the 28. of August last, at night betweene eleauen and twelue a clocke, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her accustomed maner, she pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out earnest prayers vnto God, her hands stretched out vnto heauen, (for shee had no vse of her knees,) saying, (as her selfe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards confessed before great multitudes) <hi>Thou God all-sufficient, that both canst and wilt deliuer thine owne, according to thy pleasure, loose me from this earthly tabernacle.</hi> Lying thus lifting vp her hart vnto God in effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all prayer, loe, sodainly the chamber shined as bright within, as if it had beene sun-shine,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:19431:5"/>
and shee thought shee saw before her bed, a yongman in a long white robe, who tooke her by the right hand, lifted her vp kindly vp, and spake vnto her with a soft and sweet voyce, saying, <hi>Arise in the name of God,</hi> and placed her on a chayre hard by, taking her with his right hand, by the pulse of her right arme, looking alwayes smilingly vpon her, whose long shining robe hung very low, and couered the ground: and the more shee looked vpon him, the more beautifull, faire and comely he seemed to bee, yet within a quarter of an houre, the chamber lost all the brightnesse, and the yongman vanished away from her. Wherefore the Mayd after a loud shrike fell in a sound, which noyse when her mother heard, she came out her bed greatly agast, and finding her daughter lying vpon the ground was exceedingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed: and after her daughter had reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered her spirits, asked how shee came to that place, who with all reuerence told her parents what had hapned vnto her. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the next day after being the 29. of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:19431:5"/>
last, shee who could neither stirre, nor stand nor goe for the space of 25. yeares, went lustily vp and downe the house with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any staffe, and the third day after, wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked apace into her mothers garden, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any supply and helpe of staffe at all, for which, the Maid, with her Parents, and whole congregation, with as many in the Citie as did know her (for great was the number of them who did frequent her company, after the miraculous recouery of her health) did prayse, giue thankes, and magnifie Gods great power and goodnesse, who had looked of his vnspeakable fauour vpon the low estate and grieuous sicknesse of this his poore handmaid.</p>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:19431:7"/>
was laid without the gates of the Citie vpon a dung-hill, to which wonderfull and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full spectacle the whole Citie, both young and old, rich and poore, came to behold: for it was in shape as followeth.</p>
            <p>The head was like an Otters head, but rounder: it had the nose and mouth of a man, but eares like vnto a Dogge, yet the shape of the eyes resembled much a mans: the colour of it was a fleshy colour, and about the body a scarfe of flesh, the shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were like vnto a mans to the elbow, and the priuy members not vnlike.</p>
            <p>The foreside was such as hath beene spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but behinde it had a crooked tayle, out of the mouth also did hang a huge long tongue, like vnto a Cow or some other beast of that kinde. The feet thereof very like vnto a hogges, and the mouth was all growne about with hayre. Moreouer, the knees were like two Pompions, fine and round.</p>
            <p>And now because I thought it very fit the world should take notice of this vnna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
