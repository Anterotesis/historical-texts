         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mongst those Historicall Imployments, whereunto I have devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
my later yeares, (for I read, that old men live more by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie
than by hope) we thoght it would be a little time not ill
spent, to confer the Fortunes and the natures of these two great
personages of so late knowledge, wherein I intend to doe them
right with the truth thereof, and my selfe with the freedome.</p>
            <p>The beginning of the Earle of <hi>Essex,</hi> I must attribute wholly or in great
part to my Lord of <hi>Leicester:</hi> but yet as an Introducer or Supporter, not as a
teacher: for as I goe along, it will easily appeare, that he neither lived nor
dyed by his Discipline. Alwaies certaine it is, that he drew him first into the
fatall Circle from a kinde of resolved privatenes at his house at <hi>Lampsie,</hi> in
<hi>South-Wales,</hi> where after the Academicall life, hee had taken such a taste
of the Rurall, (as I have heard him say (and not upon any flashes or
fumes of Melancholy, or traverses of discontent, but in a serene and quiet
Mood) that he could well have bent his mind to a retyred course. About
which time, the said Earl of <hi>Leicester</hi> bewrayed a meaning to plant him in
the Queens favour; which was diversly interpreted by such as thought that
great Artizan of Court to doe nothing by chance, nor much by affection.
Some therefore were of opinion, that feeling more and more in himselfe the
weight of time, and being almost tyred (if there be a satietie in power)
with that assiduous attendance, and intensive circumspection which a long
indulgent fortune did require, he was grown not unwilling for his owne
ease, to bestow handsomely upon another some part of the pains, and perhaps
of the envy.</p>
            <p>Others conceived rather, that having before for the same ends brought in,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93547:3"/>
or let in Sr. <hi>Walter Rawleigh,</hi> and having found him such an apprentize as
knew well enough how to set up for himselfe, he now meant to allie him
with this young Earle, who had yet taken no strong impressions: so
though the said Sir <hi>Walter Rauleigh</hi> was a little before this, whereof I now
speake by occasion, much fallen from his former splendor in Court; Yet
he still continued in some lustre of a favoured man, like billowes that sinke
by degrees, even when the winde is downe that first stirred them.</p>
            <p>Thus runnes the discourse of that time at pleasure; yet I am not ignorant,
that there was some good while a verie stiffe aversation in my Lord of <hi>Essex,</hi>
from applying himselfe to the Earle of <hi>Leicester,</hi> for what secret conceite
I know not; but howsoever that honour was mollified by time, and by his
mother, and to the Court, hee came under his Lord.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> had another kinde of Germination; and surely
had he beene a plant, he would have beene reckoned amonst the <hi>Sponte Nascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
for hee sprung without any help, by a kind of congeniall composure (as wee
may terme it) to the likenesse of our late Soveraigne and Master of ever blessed
memorie, who taking him into his regard taught him more and more to please
himselfe, and moulded him, (as it were) Platonically to his owne <hi>Idea,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
first in the choyse of the Materialls; because he found him susceptible
of good forme) and afterwards by degrees as great Architects use to doe in
the workmanship of his Regall hand, nor staying here, after hee had hardned
and polished him about ten yeares in the Schoole of observance, (for so a Court
is) and in the furnace of tryall about himselfe, (for he was a King could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use
men as well as bookes) he made him the associate of his heire apparant, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the now Lord <hi>Cottington,</hi> (as an adjunct of singular experience
and trust) in forraine travailes, and in a busin<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sse of love, and of no equall haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard
(if the tendernesse of our zeale did not then deceive us) enough (the
world must confesse) to kindle affection even betwixt the distantest conditions;
so as by the various and inward conversation abroad (besides that before and
after at home) with the most constant and best natured Prince, <hi>Bona si sua
Norint,</hi> as ever England enjoyed. This Duke becomes now secondly seized of
favour, as it were by discent (though the condition of that estate be no more
than a Tenancie at will, or at most for the life of the first Lord) and rarely
transmitted, which I have briefely set downe, without looking beyond the
vaile of the Temple, I meane into the secret of high inclinations, since even
Satyricall Poets, (who are otherwise of so licentious fancie) are in this poynt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
enough to confesse their ignorance.
<q>
                  <l>Nescio quid certe est quod me tibi temperet Astrum.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And these were both their springings and Imprimings as I may call them.
In the profluence or proceedings of their fortunes, I observe likewise not
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93547:3"/>
onely much difference between them: but in the Earle not a little from himself;
First, <hi>all his hopes of advancement had like to bee strangled almost in the
very Cradle, by throwing himselfe into the</hi> Portugal <hi>Voyage without the
Queenes consent, or so much as her knowledge; wherby he left his friends
and dependants neere sixe moneths in desperate suspense what would become
of him. And to speake truth not without good reason:</hi> For first they might
well consider, That he was himselfe not well plumed in favour for such a flight:
Besides that now he wanted a Lord of <hi>Leicester</hi> at home (for hee was dead the
year before) to smooth his absence, and to quench the practises at court. But above
all, it lay open to every mans Discourse, that though the bare offence to his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne
and Mistris was too great adventure, yet much more when shee might
(as in this case) have fairely discharged her displeasure upon her Lawes. <hi>Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,</hi>
a noble report comming home before him.</p>
            <p>At his returne all was cleere, and this excursion was esteemed but a Sally
of youth: Nay, he grew every day more and more in her Gracious conceit:
whether such intermissions as these do sometimes foment affection, or that
having committed a fault, he became the more obsequious and plyant to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme
it: Or that shee had not received into her Royall brest any shadows
of his popularity.</p>
            <p>There was another time long after, when Sir <hi>Fulke Grevill</hi> (late Lord
<hi>Brooke</hi>) a man in appearance intrinsecal with him, or at the least admitted
to his Melancholly houres, eyther belike espying some wearinesse in the
Queene, or perhaps with little change of the word though more in the
dangersome markes towards him, and working upon the present matter
(as she was dexterous and close) had almost superinduced into favour the
Earle of <hi>Southampton;</hi> which yet being timely discovered, my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi>
chose to evaporate his thoughts in a Sonnet (beeing his common way) to
be sung before the Queene, (as it was) by one <hi>Hales,</hi> in whose voyce shee
tooke some pleasure; whereof the complot me thinkes, had asmuch of the
Hermit as of the Post:
<q>
                  <l>And if thou shouldst by Her be now forsaken,</l>
                  <l>She made thy Heart too strong for to be shaken.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>As if hee had beene casting one eye backe at the least to his former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirednesse.
But all this likewise quickly vanished, and there was a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while
after faire weather over-head. Yet still I know not how, like a ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering
of Clouds, till towards his latter time, when his humours grew
Tart, as being now in the Lees of favour; it brake forth into certayne sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
recesses; sometimes from the Court to <hi>Wansteed,</hi> other whiles unto
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93547:4"/>
               <hi>Greenewitch,</hi> often to his owne Chamber, Doores shut, Visits forbidden,
and which was worse, divers Contestations (betweene) with the <hi>Queene</hi>
her selfe (all preambles of ruine) wherewith though now and then hee did
Wring out of her Majesty some petty contentments, (as a man would presse
sower Grapes) yet in the meane time was forgotten the Counsell of a Wise,
and then a Propheticall Friend, who told him that such Courses as those,
were like hot Waters, who helpe at a pang, but if they be too often used,
will spoyle the stomacke.</p>
            <p>On the Dukes part, wee have no such abrupt straynes and precipees as
these, but a faire fluent and uniforme course under both Kings: And surely
as there was in his naturall Constitution a marvailous equality, whereof I
shall speake more afterwards; so there was an image of it in his Fortune
running (if I may borrow an ancient comparison) as smoothly as a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Verse, till it met with certayne Rubs in <hi>Parliament,</hi> whereof I am
induced by the very Subject which I handle, to say somewhat, so farre as
shall concerne the difference betweene their times.</p>
            <p>WHen my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> stood in Favour, the Parliaments were calme:
Nay, I finde it a true observation, that there was no impeachment of any
Nobleman by the Commons, from the Raigne of King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth, untill
the eighteenth of King <hi>Iames,</hi> nor any intervenient president of that Nature,
not that something or other could be wanting to be sayed, while men are men:
For not to goe higher, wee are taught easily so much, by the very Ballads and
Libels of <hi>Leicestrian</hi> time.</p>
            <p>But about the aforesayd Yeare<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> many young ones being chosen into the house
of Commons, more then had beene usuall in great Councells (who though of the
weakest Wiugs, are the highest Flyers) there arose a certayne unfortunate and
unfruitfull Spirit in some places; not sowing, but picking at every stone in
the Field, rather then tending to the generall Harvest. And thus farre the
Consideration of the Nature of the Time hath transported me, and the occasion
of the subject.</p>
            <p>Now on the other side, I must with the like Liberty observe two weighty
and watchfull Solicitudes (as I may call them) which kept the Earle in extream
and continuall Caution, like a Bow still bent, whereof the Dukes thoughts
were absolutely free.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:93547:4"/>
First, hee was to wrestle with a <hi>Queenes</hi> declyning, or rather with
Her very setling Age (as wee may terme it) which besides other respects is
commonly even of it selfe the more umbratious and apprehensive, as for
the most part all Horizons are charged with certayn Vapours towards their
Evening.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The other was a matter of more Circumstance, standing
thus, viz.</head>
               <p>ALl Princes, especially those whom God hath not blessed with naturall
issue, are (by Wisesome of State) somewhat shye of their Successors,
and to speake with due Reverence, there may be reasonably supposed in
Queenes Regnant, a little proportion of tendernes that way, more then in
Kings. Now there were in Court two names of <hi>Power,</hi> and almost of <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi>
the <hi>Essexian</hi> and the <hi>Cecilian</hi> with their Adherents, both well
enough enjoying the present, and yet both looking to the future, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
both holding correspondency with some of the principall in <hi>Scotland,</hi>
and hath received advertisements and instructions, eyther from them, or
immediatly from the King as Induciat Heire of this Imperiall Crowne.</p>
               <p>But least they might detect one another; this was Mysteriously carried
by severall instruments and Conducts, and on the <hi>Essextian</hi> side, in truth
with infinite hazard, for Sir <hi>Robert Cecill</hi> who (as Secretary of State) did
dispose the publicke addresses, had prompter and safer conveyance; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
I cannot but relate a memorable passage on eyther part, as the story fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
shall declare.</p>
               <p>The Earle of <hi>Essex</hi> had accommodated Master <hi>Anthony Bacon</hi> in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition
of his House, and had assigned him a noble entertaynement: This

               <p>These two accidents precisely true, and knowne to few, I have repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               </p>
               <p>The Earle was a pretty deale the Taller, and much the stronger, and of
the abler body: But the Duke had the neater limbes and freer delivery; he
was also the uprighter, and of the more comely motions, for the Earle
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:93547:5"/>
did bend a little in the neck, though rather forwards then downewards,
and he was so far from being a good dancer, that he was no gracefull goe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.
If we touch particulars, the Duke exceeded in the daintinesse of his leg and
foote, and the Earle in the incomparable fairenesse and fine shape of his
hands; which (though it be but a feminine praise he tooke from his Father)
for the generall Ayre, the Earle had the closer and more reserved Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
bei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g by nature somewhat more cogitative, and (which was strange)
never more then at meales when others are least: Insomuch as he was wont
to make this observation of himselfe, that to solve any knottie businesse
which cumbred his minde, his ablest houres was when hee had checked
his first appetite with two or three morsells, after which he sate usually for a
good while silent, yet hee would play well and willingly at some games
of greatest attention, which shewed that when hee listed he could licence
his thoughts.</p>
               <p>The Duke on the other side, even in the midst of so many diversions, had
continually a very pleasant and vacant face (as I may well call it) procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
no doubt from a singular assurance in his temper. And yet I must here
give him a rarer Elogie, which the malignest eye cannot deny him. That
certainely never man in his place and power, did entertaine greatnesse more
familiarly, nor whose lookes were lesse tainted with his felicitie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
I insist the rather because this in my Iudgement was one of his greatest
vertues and victories of himselfe.</p>
               <p>But to proceed, in the attyring and Ornament of their bodyes, the Duke a
fine and unaffected politenesse, and upon occasion costlie, as in his lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>The Earle as he grew more and more attentive to businesse and matter, so
lesse and lesse curious of cloathing: Insomuch, as I doe remember those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
him had a conceit that possibly sometimes when hee went up to the
Queene, hee might scant know what he had on, for this was his manner,
his chamber being commonly stived with friends or Suitors of one kinde or
other, when he gave his legs, armes, and brest to his ordinary servants to
button and dresse him with little heede, his head and face to his Barbour,
his eyes to his letters, and eares to Petitioners, and many times all at once,
then the Gentleman of his Robes throwing a cloak over his shoulders hee
would make a step into his Closet, and after a short prayer, he was gone:
onely in his Baths, he was somewhat delicate, for point of dyet and luxurie,
they were both very inordinate in their appetites, especially the Earle, who
was by nature of so different a taste, that I must tel a rare thing of him (though
it bee but a homely note) that he would stop in the middest of any Physicall
potion, and after he had licked his lips, he would drinke of the rest, but I
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:93547:6"/>
am weary of such slight Animadversions.</p>
               <p>To come therefore to the inward furniture of their mindes, I will thus
much declare.</p>
               <p>The Earle was of good Erudition having been placed at study in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi>

               <p>The Duke was Illiterate, yet had learned at Court, first to sift and

him of the best Instruments of experience and knowledge, from whom
hee had a sweet and attractive manner, to suck what might be for the publike

the more by the graces.</p>
               <p>To consider them in their Pure Naturalls, I conceive the Earles intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectuall

               <p>Yet all know that he likewise at the first was much under the expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

for their Abilities of discourse or pen, the Earle was a very Acute and sound
speaker when he would intend it, and for his writings, they are beyond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
especially in his familiar letters and things of delight at Court when
he would admit his serious habits, as may be yet seen in his Impresses and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions

The Dukes delivery of his minde, I conceive not to be so sharpe as solid
and grave, not so solid and deepe as pertinent, and apposite to the times and
occasions.</p>
               <p>The Earl I account the more liberall, and the D. the more magnificent, for
I doe not remember that my Lord of <hi>Essex</hi> in all his life time did. build or
adorn any house, the Queen perchance spending his time, and himselfe
his meanes, or otherwise more inclyning to popular wayes, for wee knowe
the people are apter to applaud housekeepers then house-raisers, they were
both great cherishers of Schollers and Divines, but it seemes the Earle had
obteyned of himselfe one singular point, that he could depart his affection
betweene two extreames, for though hee bare alwayes a kinde of filiall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
towards Doctor <hi>Whitguist,</hi> both before and after he was Archbish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op,
yet on the other side, he did not a little love and tender Master <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,</hi>
though I think truely with large distinction between the persons and
the causes, howsoever hee was taxed with other ends, in respecting that
partie.</p>
               <p>They were both faire spoken Gentlemen, not Prone and eager to detract
openly from any man, and in this the Earle hath been most falsely blemish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in our vulgar story: Onely against one man, he had forsworne all pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
namely <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and would call him (<hi>per Excellen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Sycophant (as if it had been an Embleme of his name) even to

part of their Natures the Earle was the worse Philosopher, beeing a great
Resenter and a weak dissembler of the least disgrace: And herein likewise as

               <p>In the growth of their fortunes, the Duke was a little the swifter, and

people, even above my Lord of <hi>Leicester:</hi> the trueth is from thenceforth

               <p>THe Dukes employment abroad in this nature, was onely in the Action
of the <hi>Ile of Reez,</hi> of which I must note somewhat for the honour of
our Country, and of his Majesties times, and of them that perished and
survived, and to redeeme it generally from mis-understanding. Therefore
after enquiry amongst the wisest and most indifferent me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>; of that Action
I dare pronounce, that all Circumstances pondered, a tumultuary banding o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, with neere two thousand foote, and watching
their best time of advantage, none of their foote discovered by us before,
nor so much as suspected, and only some of their Horse descried stragling,
but not in any bulke or body: their Cavalry not a Troop of <hi>Biscoigners</hi> moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in hast, but the greater part Gentlemen of Family, and of pickt Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
and such as charged home both in Front and on both flankes into

their foot likewise comming on to charge, till not liking the businesse they
fell to flinging of stones and so walked away.</p>
               <p>I say these things considered and laid together, wee have great reason
to repute it a great impression upon an unknown place, and a noble argument
that upon occasion we have not lost our Auncient vigor. Only I could wish
that the Duke who then in the animating of the souldiers shewed them very

reward and punishment, there was very few remarkable occasions under
the Duke, saving his continuall vigilancie and voluntary hazard of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

to disband, and the Inferiour Commanders were still in the
sight.</p>
               <p>In the Earle wee have two examples of his severity, the one in the
Island voyage where hee threw a Souldier with his owne hands out of
a Ship, the other in <hi>Ireland</hi> where hee decima<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nitie, and one of his facilitie,
when hee did Connive at the bolde Trespasse of Sir <hi>Walter Rawl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

who before his owne arrivall at <hi>Fy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Commandement, at which time hee let fall a Noble word being pressed
by one (whose name I need not remember) that at the least he would put him
upon a Martiall Court. That I would doe (<hi>sayd hee</hi>) if he were not my
friend.</p>
               <p>And now I am drawing towards the last Act, which was written in the
book of necessity.</p>
               <p>At the Earles end I was abroade, but when I came (home though little
was left for writers to gleane after judges) yet, I spent some curiosity to
search what it might bee that could precipitate him into such a prodigious
Catastrophe, and I must according to my professed freedome, deliver a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance
or two of some weight in the truth of that story, which was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
discovered at his araignment nor after in any of his private Confessions.</p>
               <p>There was amongst his nearest attendants one <hi>Henry Cuffe,</hi> A man
of secret ambitious ends of his owne, and of proportionate Counsells
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93547:8"/>
smoothered under the habit of a Scholler, and slubbered over with a certayne
rude and Clownish fashion, that had the semblance of integrity.</p>
               <p>This person not above five or sixe weekes before my Lords fatall irruption
into the City, was by the Earles Speciall Commaund suddainely discharged
from all further attendance, or accesse unto him, out of an inward dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasure
then taken against his sharpe and importune infusions, and out of a
glimmering oversight, that he would proove the very instrument of his
Ruine.</p>
               <p>I must adde hereeunto, that about the same time my Lord had received
from the Countesse of <hi>Warwicke</hi> (a Lady powerfull in the Court) and indeed
a vertuous user of her power, the best advise that, I thinke, was ever given
from eyther Sex. That when hee was free from restraint, hee should
<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> take any out-lodging at <hi>Greenewich,</hi> and sometimes when the Queen
went abroad in a good humour, (whereof shee would give him notice) he
should come forth, and humble himselfe before Her in the field.</p>
               <p>This Counsell su<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ke much into him, and for some dayes hee resolved it:
but in the meane time through the intercession of the Earle of <hi>Southampton,</hi>
whom <hi>Cuffe</hi> had gained, hee was restored to my Lords eare, and so work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
advantage upon his disgraces, and upon the vain foundation of vulgar
breath, which hurts many good men, spun out the finall destruction of his
Master and himselfe, and almost of his restorer, if his pardon had not been
wonne by inches.</p>
               <p>True it is, that the Earle in <hi>Westminster-hall</hi> did in generall disclose the
evill perswasions of this man; but the particulars which I have related of
his dismission and restitution, hee buried in his owne breast for some
reasons apparent enough. Indeede (as I conjecture) not to exasperate the
Case of my Lord of <hi>Southampton,</hi> though hee might therewith a little
peradventure have mollified his owne. The whole and true Report I had
by infallible meanes from the person himselfe that both brought the
advise from the afore-sayd excellent Lady, and carried the discharge to
<hi>Cuffe,</hi> who in a private Chamber was strucken therewith into a Sound
almost dead to the Earth, as if hee had fallen from some high steeple, such
Turrets of hope hee had built in his owne Fancy.</p>
               <p>Touching the Dukes suddaine period, how others have represented it
unto their Fancies, I cannot determine, for my part I must confesse from
my Soule, that I never recall it to minde without a deepe and double asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
of my discourse and reason.</p>
               <p>First of the very horrour and attrocity of the Fact in a Christian Court,
under so moderate a Governement, but much more at the impudency of
the pretence, whereby a desperate discontented Assassinate would after
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:93547:9"/>
the perpetration have honested a meere private revenge (as by precedent
Circumstances is evident enough) with I know not what publique respects,
and would faine have given it a parliamentary cover howsoever. Thus these
two great Peeres were dis-roabed of their Glory, the one by judgement, and
the other by violence, which was the finall distinction.</p>
               <p>Now after this short contemplation of their diversities, for much more
might have beene spoken, but that I was fitter for Rapsody then commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
I am lastly desirous to take a Summarie viewe of their Conformities,
which I verily beleeve will be fou<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d as many, though perchance heeded
by few as are extent in any of the ancient Parallell.</p>
               <p>They both slept long in the armes of For<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>une: They were both of ancient
blood, and of Forraigne extraction: They were both of straight and goodly
stature, and of able and active bodies: They were both industrious and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siduous
and intentive to their ends: They were both early Privy Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors,
and imployed at home in the secretest and weightiest affaires in Court
and State: They were both likewise Commaunders abroad in Chiefe, as well
by Sea as by Land; both Masters of the Horse at home; both chosen Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellours
of the same Vniversity, namely, <hi>Cambridge.</hi> They were indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
strong and high minded men; yet of sweet and accostable Nature, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
equally delighting in the presse and affluence of Dependants and Sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
which are alwayes the Burres, and sometimes the Briers of Favourits.
They were both married to very vertuous Ladies, and sole Heires, and left
issue of eyther Sex, and both their Wives converted to contrary Religions.
They were both in themselves <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>re and excellent examples of Temperance
and Sobriety, but neyther of them of Continency.</p>
               <p>Lastly, after they had beene both Subject (as all Greatnesse and splendor
is) to certayne obloquies of their Actions; They both concluded their
earthly felicity in unnaturall ends, and with no great distance of time in
the space eyther of Life or Favour.</p>
               <p>And so having discharged this poore Exercise of my Pen accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to my knowledge and Reality, let us commit
those two noble Peeres to their Eternall rest,
with their memorable abilities remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in few, and their compsssionate
infirmities common to all.</p>
