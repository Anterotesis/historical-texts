            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This Towne of <hi>Stamford</hi> is of great antiquity, and was built (as the tradition goes) 863 yeares before the Incarnation of Christ by <hi>Bladud</hi> a King of the <hi>Britaines,</hi> who being himself a great Philosopher endeavoured at this Towne to plant the study of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in emulation or imitation of the ancient <hi>Athenian</hi> Schooles, and drawing hither the learnedst and gravest men of that Science that were to be found in the whole World, it flourished in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Heathenish learning till the time of K. <hi>Lucius,</hi> who was the first that here imbraced the Christian Faith by the Preaching of <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatius</hi> and <hi>Damianus,</hi> sent hither into <hi>Britaine</hi> by <hi>Eleutherus</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>Rome</hi>; and as before it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>The Walls have in them Five principall Gates or entries, <hi>Peter-gate</hi> on the West St. <hi>Clements-gate</hi> on the North, <hi>Paul-gate,</hi> and St. <hi>Georges-gate</hi> toward the East, and the <hi>Bridge gate</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the South: To these may be added a Sixth standing North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>east called the <hi>New-gate,</hi> but made long since the ancient Gates were erected all the rest appearing to have slippes of strong Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullesses, which <hi>New-gate</hi> wanteth.

            <p>The Castle was scituated whilest it stood upon the side of an Hill (as indeed all the Towne stands upon the rising of an hill) but the Castle-hill appeares somewhat artificiall, being cast up round and higher then the ordinary degree, stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding well towards the middest of the Towne and somwhat South-west, facing the River with a very pleasant prospect.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Heere hath been likewise in former times (as I said before) thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene Parish Churches besides three Chappels, namely St <hi>Maries, All-Saints,</hi> St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> St. <hi>Michaels,</hi> St <hi>Iohns, Trinity</hi> Church, <hi>Paules</hi> Church, <hi>Peter</hi> Church, St. <hi>Georges,</hi> St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews, Clement</hi> Church, St. <hi>Stephens,</hi> and St. <hi>Martins,</hi> in <hi>Stamford-Baron.</hi>

            <p>This Towne hath (as many other ancient Boroughes of <hi>England</hi> have) a power to send up two <hi>Burgesses</hi> to every Parliament: So that they have not only the power to execute Lawes, but also a share in making of lawes: And here is to bee observed the reason, why the Princes and policy of <hi>England</hi> have had a regard, as it were to the fencing and hedging about the Cities and ancient Boroughs of this Land with Priviledges and Immunities, for the stronger de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, preservation and maintenance of the same, and that for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers great and weighty ends and purposes.

            <p>An ominous thing to the Towne, for some of the Lords of the same of his succession (though not of his Descent) have since upon their hornes of greatnesse, tossed the best of the Burgesses out of their gownes, and why?

            <l>Distractions, which can wretched man befall:</l>
            <l>I have at length (through my Creators ayd)</l>
            <l>The Towne of <hi>Stamford,</hi> seriously Survey'd.</l>

            <l>It lies apparant to the view of Men:</l>
            <l>Who first the building of the same contriv'd,</l>
            <l>And when in time it grew more longer liv'd,</l>

            <l>By <hi>Hereticks</hi> undone, by <hi>Danes</hi> much sackt and spoyl'd.</l>
            <l>Yet at the length her Ruines were redrest</l>

            <l>She flourish'd under Governours discreet</l>
            <l>Till the whole Land with Civill warres did meet:</l>
            <l>When <hi>Yorke</hi> and <hi>Lancaster</hi> their Swords out drew,</l>
            <l>And like mad Lyons keene their kindred slew:</l>

            <l>Though our fourth <hi>Edward</hi> by his Charter kind,</l>
