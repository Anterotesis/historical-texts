            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE
PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Author of this
Tract may thus be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
Are not the
Corps of dead men Sacred? To
violate Tombs and Graves is
Sacrilegious, why doth the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
intend to diſturb the <hi>Manes</hi>
of this univerſal Scholar?
Will he not be permitted to ſleep
quietly in the Grave? How
unworthy a thing is it to inſult
over a dead Lyon, and write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
<pb facs="tcp:43969:3"/>
him who reſts in the duſt?
The Author hears theſe words
with a quiet mind; Certainly
if to anſwer the works of thoſe
who are dead be ſo Criminal,
how hainous offendors have ſo
many writers in all ages been?
and how Capital a Delinquent is
<hi>Mr. Hobs,</hi> who hath by write<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
endeavoured to render the
ſentiments of the beſt and moſt
learned men ridiculous. This
Treatiſe diſcourſeth with his
Ghoſt; He dyed in 1679, and
the Treatiſe came out in 80.
'Tis his <hi>umbra,</hi> it carries his
own lineaments, and ſpeaks his
own language. A Reverend
Neighbour Miniſter, a Learned
<pb facs="tcp:43969:3"/>
Friend of the Authors, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
him with the language
of <hi>Mr. Hobs</hi> in private di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcourſe,
exactly agreeing with
this Tract, and we find the
moſt of it <hi>cap 1, and 2. de He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſi
app. ad Leviath. Ed. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina.</hi>
I will acknowledge him a
Gentleman of great parts, of a
wonderful vivacity to his old
age; that he had ſo fine a Pen,
that by the clearneſs, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of his Style, and exactneſs
of his method, he gain'd more
Proſelytes than by his Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples:
few exceed him in both
languages, but theſe aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize
his Crimes; he ought not
to have abuſed ſuch excellent

qualifications, he hath ſo mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
his Pen, that many believe
him unanſwerable, yet let this
Tract be conſidered whether he
be not fully refuted, as to the
Contents of his Narrative. I
will appeal to the Learned
World, whether <hi>Mr. Hobs</hi> hath
not thrown dirt and ugly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
upon the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
the beſt of Councils, the
whole Chriſtian Clergie, and
hath abuſed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws.</p>
            <p>It may be again objected,
This Author durſt not write
whilſt he was a live: Whom
did <hi>Mr. Hobs</hi> ever anſwer,
but the clear Pen of the Arch-B.
of <hi>Armagh,</hi> and the Great
<pb facs="tcp:43969:5"/>
Profeſſor <hi>Dr. Wallis?</hi> In the
Verſes which he made of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
he vaunts a Victory, the
world is the Judge, if what he
ſaith be true, <hi>That there is
an Eternal Fate and Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi>
Why can he commend him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and diſcommend others; If
in theſe Lines the Author does
a thing ill, what reproof does he
deſerve, he is hurried to it by
a fatal Neceſſity. On this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
his praiſing himſelf, and
diſpraiſing others is groundleſs,
he is charged with contradictions
from a great one, of which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to vindicate himſelf;
but 'tis in vain, his artifices are
fruitleſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:43969:6"/>
One of his Moral and Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Principles is, <hi>That whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is juſt or unjuſt, or to
be received as true or falſe,
is by the approbation or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of the Supream Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi>
He writes his <hi>Ieviathan,</hi>
in which this is aſſerted and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended,
yet in the ſame <hi>evia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi>
he delivers thoſe doctrines
for true, which are judged He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical
by the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:
To evade this he uſeth all
Art and Induſtry.</p>
            <p>In the Firſt part of this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
ſome Doctrines which he
propagated in that Book are
proved Heretical. In the Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:43969:6"/>
part is proved, That theſe
Doctrines are Criminal, and
the perſons that maintain'd
them are liable to be puniſhed
by the Civil Majeſtrate. His
Book being <hi>An Hiſtorical
Narrative,</hi> the Author is
forc'd to have recourſe to Books.
<hi>Mr. Hobs</hi> gives us ſeveral
Hiſtories, but Quotes no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour;
whereupon the Anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is compelled to cite the place
whence he has taken them. No
Memory, Reading, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
or Obſervation is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
therefore the Authour
ſometime uſeth this or the like
expreſſion, ſo as to him it occurs;
he abſtaines from all virulent
<pb facs="tcp:43969:7"/>
language; the hardeſt word,
and that but once uſed, is Noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
falſe. <hi>Mr. Hobs</hi> gives
occaſion to diſpute a great part
of his <hi>Leviathan,</hi> but the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerer
proſecutes his deſign, to
make good the Contradiction;
as for Inſtance, <hi>Mr. Hobs</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verrs
<hi>That God hath Parts;</hi>
here is a juſt occaſion to diſpute
The Nature of Spirits, but the
Authour waves it, 'tis ſufficient
to prove That the Church of
<hi>England</hi> has judged that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
Heretical, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
has contradicted himſelf:
He aſſerts, <hi>That they who
embr<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce the Liberty of the
Will are allyed to the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:43969:7"/>
This gives a fair op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to diſcourſe of Liberty
and Neceſſity: and he that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
conſiders himſelf will
find, the freedom of his Will
ariſeth not from the flexibilty of
the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding, flowing
from various impreſſions upon
that faculty, but from the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
which the Will has over
it ſelf, which the <hi>Greeks</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
expreſs by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
but the Authour does not medle
with that Controverſie, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf with the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of the abſurdity of <hi>Mr.
Hobs</hi> his Imputation, and that
it is contrariant to the Doctrine
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The
<pb facs="tcp:43969:8"/>
Doctrine of the Sacred Trinity
is religiouſly imbrac'd and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d
by the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as it was by the Church
of Chriſt in all ages; hence <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi>
in his Philopatris jeer'd
the Primitive Chriſtians for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
ſuch an incredible opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
That <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſhould be <gap reason="foreign">

and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>(i. e.) Tres U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi>
and <hi>Unus Tres,</hi> Three
Perſons and One God, which
ſcoff ſhews ſufficiently the Faith
of the Primitive Church. The
Authour does not therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute
the Doctrine of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but wipes off all that Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
with which Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi>
uſeth to bide the deformity of
<pb facs="tcp:43969:8"/>
his ſentiments, and makes him
appear in his proper Colours;
proves him Heretical, in being
an enemy to the Faith, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
The like may be ſaid of other
things which the Author treats
of, the charge being made good,
that <hi>Mr. Hobs</hi> has notoriouſly
contradicted himſelf: His book
is anſwered, and his great <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulatum</hi>
demonſtrated to be
falſe, in that he is forc'd to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
thoſe things which
are contrary to it.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43969:11"/>
of a middle, or indifferent
ſenſe, but of an evil, and
reproachful acceptation.</p>
            <p>'Tis granted, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Empire was full of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
when the Goſpel
was preached, and that ſome,

were choſen out of theſe
Philoſophers: The primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Chriſtians had a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

were Chriſtians, were not
Biſhops: ſuch were the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
and Maſters in the
School of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taenus,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43969:11"/>
Clemens Alexandrinus,
Origen, &amp;c.</hi> The Heathens
objected againſt the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
that few of them were
Learned, which cauſed St.
<hi>Jerome</hi> to write his Book <hi>De
Viris Illuſtribus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis a gaeat atteſtation to
the truth of Chriſtianity, that
it appeared when Philoſophy
ſo much flouriſhed in the
world. Thoſe great Wits,
which were ſo vaſtly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with Oratory, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and the Tongues, if
there had been any cheat
acted by the Chriſtians
they would eaſily have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
it: therefore when
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:43969:12"/>
Chriſt profeſt that by his
works he might be known,
he and his Apoſtles wrought
thoſe Miracles which gave
a clear atteſtation to his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.
No doubt, but ſome
of theſe Philoſophers were
converted, but that (by
reaſon of their great skill in
Oratory and Philoſophy)
moſt of the Primitive Church
were choſen out of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of theſe Philoſophers;
'Tis deny'd. In the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Church for the three
firſt Centuries, there was
not a Philoſopher made a
Biſhop.</p>
            <p>When Chriſtians became
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43969:12"/>
numerous, they ſent their
Children to be inſtructed in
Philoſophy and the Liberal
Sciences, who became brave
perſons. But I am ignorant
if any Philoſopher convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
was made a Biſhop. What
<hi>Hobbs</hi> averrs, that theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
retaining their Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
<hi>Dogma's,</hi> interpreting
Scriptures according to their
own Sect, that thus at firſt
<hi>Hereſie</hi> entered into the
Church, is not true; for
<hi>Hereſie</hi> was crept into the
Church in the Apoſtles time,
St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
to beware of <hi>Hereſies,</hi>
and St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith there are
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43969:13"/>
thoſe who ſhall privily bring
in damnable <hi>Hereſies.</hi> I do
ackowledge <hi>Tertullian</hi> wrote
ſmartly and truly, when he
term'd Philoſophers the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs
of Hereticks. <hi>De

Cap.</hi> 19. gives us an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
from what Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
the <hi>Valentinian</hi> and
<hi>Gnoſtick Hereſies</hi> borrow'd
their abſurd and monſtrous
opinions, But then we muſt
ſay, that theſe Hereticks
were not Paſtors in the
Church. The firſt that
broach't thoſe prodigious o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions
was <hi>Simon Magus,</hi>
who was onely baptiz'd. In
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43969:13"/>
the firſt Century, there was
not one Heretick, which
was a Paſtor or Biſhop in the
Church of Chriſt. The <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie</hi>
of the <hi>Nicholaitans</hi> took
its riſe from <hi>Nicholas</hi> one of
the Seven Deacons: he did
not broach that <hi>Hereſie,</hi> but
ſome who miſinterpreted a
paſſage of his, were the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
of it. Nor any of the
Chriſtian Clergy was the
Author of any <hi>Hereſie</hi> in the
ſecond Century. <hi>Tatius</hi> was
a great Orator converted by
<hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and was the
Author of the <hi>Hereſie</hi> of the
<hi>Encratites,</hi> but he was not
of the Clerical order. In the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43969:14"/>
third Century. <hi>Novatus</hi> a
<hi>Roman</hi> Preſbyter broach't his
<hi>Hereſie</hi> (I ſpeak according to
the beſt knowledge I have in
the Church hiſtory) <hi>viz.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the not receiving the
<hi>Lapſi</hi> into Communion, but
he was not a Philoſopher,
nor was his opinions any wiſe
a kin to the <hi>Dogma's</hi> of the
heathen Philoſophers. <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos</hi>
was an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> Biſhop,
not a profeſt Philoſopher; a
perſon of great excellency in
many things, the Author of
the opinion of Chriſts reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a 1000 years upon Earth,
which opinion is founded, not
upon any of the Principles
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43969:14"/>
of Philoſophy, but upon
ſome paſſages in the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.
<hi>Paulus Samoſatenus</hi>
made Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> was
the broacher of many evil
Doctrines, but he was not a
Philoſopher.</p>
            <p>The deſign of Mr. <hi>Hobbs</hi>
eaſily appears, he every

Philoſophy, from which

to be refuſed: That all the

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:43969:15"/>
ſay, that excommunication,
or caſting a man out of the
Church, or eſteeming him as
an heathen man, was but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy,
'tis to deny Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.
One of the great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of the Church was Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
diſcipline and the
divine cenſures, of which
excommunication was the
ſevereſt, and is ſtill, if duely
manag'd, the greateſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment.
To be thrown out
of the Church, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priv'd
of the Prayers of the
Church, to have no part in
thoſe offices of Religion, by
which the Grace and Favour
of God is obtain'd, and to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43969:16"/>
be delivered to Satan, is
this Infamy onely? To be
outlaw'd, whereby a perſon
is depriv'd of the benefit and
liberty of the law; he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived
of the liberty of his
Countrey, he enjoys not a
free air, houſe, nor harbor,
and by reaſon a Capital pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
is inflicted on thoſe who
afford him any reception or
give him any relief, he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to the utmoſt peril of
ruine except the outlawry be
reverſt. Is this only Infamy?
The Calamity that Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
involves a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
in, is far greater. For
Excommunication acording
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43969:16"/>
to the Doctrine of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church was reputed
a ſentence excluing the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated
Perſons from
the Kingdome of Heaven:
and hence by <hi>Tertullian</hi> in
his Apology called <hi>futuri
judicij praejudicium.</hi> Is this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Infamy? He might have
ſaid, that Chriſtianity is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
the promiſes and
threatnings contained in it
are mere Chimaera's: thence,
tho they that embrace it, do
entertain ſuch a belief, tis
but a fancy, therefore all the
evil which attends by excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municationis
onely Infamy.
Excommunication was not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43969:17"/>
onely for <hi>Hereſies,</hi> but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
for immoralities;
and excommunication did
not brand a man for an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick,</hi>
but the perſon being
rendred infamous for his <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie</hi>
was (if in the boſome of
the Church) caſt out. That
<hi>Heretick</hi> and <hi>Catholick</hi> became
not Relatives by this excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,
nor by this did
Heretick become a name, and
a name of diſgrace both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
A Perſon by becoming
an Heretick was excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated,
this name did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
not follow excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication.
It muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
that the <hi>Hereſies</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43969:17"/>
the Trinity were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
troubleſome in the

An Infinite cannot
conſiſt of finite parts; ſeveral

it muſt be acknowledged,
that there is a being which
is not corporeal, and farther
tis moſt certain that <hi>Hobs</hi>
contradicts his own great
principle, that the ſupream
Power is the ſole Judge of
Good and Evil, Truth and
Falſehood. He is a Subject

            <p>2. As to the Nature of
a Thing infinite, there can
be but two juſt acceptions
of it.</p>
            <p>It ſignifies a being which

and ſo it connotes
the great God, the Eternal
Majeſty, and this infers, there
cannot be two Infinites, for
there muſt not be two of all
perfections. 2. Or a being
that is boundleſs, or hath no
terme. The name Infinite
may be given to other things,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43969:31"/>
as an Infinite Sea becauſe it
cannot be exhauſted, take

the Nature of a thing; the

I may at the ſame time have
a conception of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and
not have the conception of a

doth ſay that <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and a

of created beings af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
two different <hi>modes</hi> of

is of God. There is but one
conception of the <hi>Eſſence</hi> and
<hi>Exiſtence</hi> of a God, and of
them there is no ſort of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction:
The <hi>Abſtract</hi> and

neither <hi>Corporeal,</hi> nor <hi>Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal.</hi>
That I grant, ſome <hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi>

of every thing when <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal</hi>

the Perſons were Temporal
(<hi>i. e.</hi>) God became a Father,
when he created the World,
A Son when he redeemed
Mankind, and the Holy Ghoſt
when he Sanctifies; which is
abſolutely contrary to the

account of Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> the

Not to mention ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
I will aſſign theſe Two.
The Nature of <hi>God,</hi> and the
Myſtery of the Individual

and <hi>Impiouſly</hi> explicated. He
Blaſphemouſly avers <hi>God hath

of the Holy Trinity to be
Temporal, not Eternal; both
which are declared Heretical
by the firſt Article,) and by
the three Creeds. The <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thanaſian
Creed</hi> is imbodyed
into the Common Law, and
that his opinion concerning
the Trinity is Heretical is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitable,
waveing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts
he ſtrives violently to
maintain, that Nothing in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Faith is declared Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
by the Law, or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
by the Civil Mageſtrate.
For faith he <q rend="inline margQuotes">'the Lady <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>

But it was granted to them
