            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MOderator, Being conſcious of my Innocence, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf Wronged, and Injured, I here Appeal from this Synod, to the firſt <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> when it shall meet; And in the mean time to Their <hi>Majeſties Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection,</hi> for Juſtice and Relief; and ſince the Law al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Liedges a competent time to give in the Reaſons of their Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals; I here Proteſt within Twenty four hours, to give in the Reaſons of this my Appeal to your Clerk; And withall, I proteſt that this be Recorded by him. And upon all I take Inſtruments.</p>

               <head>The Reaſons of Appeal of Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot</hi> Miniſter as <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> from the Synod of <hi>Midlothian,</hi> to the next Lawful <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> And to <hi>Their Majeſties</hi> Protection for Justice, and Relief in the mean time.</head>
               <p>THere being a Lybel given in to the <hi>Presbytery</hi> of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> againſt the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot,</hi> and the Lybel bearing it to be given in, in the Name of the Parochiners, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot</hi> and Parochiners compeared, and craved that the Ingivers of the Lybel might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended upon, and that they might owne and ſubſcribe it; And that in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:54226:4"/>
regard that the ſaid Heretors and Parochiners did not only <hi>Viva Voce.</hi> but by a Write under their Hands Diſclaim and Diſowne it, except <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Calderwood,</hi> and a few others, <hi>ex faece populi.</hi> And albeit no Lybel ought to be admitted without a Purſuer; yet the Presbytery refuſed to condeſcend upon the Ingivers of the Lybel, or to ordain them to own and ſubſcribe it. Like as, none had the confidence to own it, except the ſaid <hi>Alexander Calderwood,</hi> who ſat among them as one of the Ruling Elders, and who is notourly known to be the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot</hi>'s declared Enemy (althô without cauſe) and who invented and reported moſt falſe Calumnies againſt him, of which when he was challenged, his anſwer was, That whether they were true or falſe, he had thereupon taken two hundred of the Parochiners from his Communion; And a Declinator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given in againſt him as Informer and Promoter of the Lybel, which not only conſiſted in the knowledge of the Presbytery (who had no other Information but his) but which was like wayes offered to be proven be his Oath; yet notwithſtanding thereof, againſt all Law, Reaſon, and good Order, the Presbytery would not remove him, but allowed him to ſit as one of Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi>'s Judges, and appointed him one of the Examinators of the Witneſſes. And he forgetting that ſtation, informed and tampered with ſome of them, and threatned others, as to what they should depone: And the Witneſſes being overawed and interrupted in their Examinations, and not allowed to declare the hail Truth in complext matters of Fact, whereby the Depoſitions may be lame and weak, and carry a quite contrary meaning of the Truth, of what the Witneſſes offered to depone; And ſome of the Witneſſes having deſired that they might ſee and read their own Depoſitions before they ſubſcribed them, the ſame was abſolutely refuſed, with this Expoſtulation, What? do you diſtruſt us? and do you queſtion our Clerk's honeſty? And thus they cauſed theſe Witneſſes ſubſcribe what was written, ſo that there may be left out the material parts of their Depoſitions, which cleared their Miniſter. And not only are there ſeveral Articles of the Lybel, which are not upon theſe Heads, to which the Trial of the <hi>Regular Clergy</hi> is reſtricted be Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and which are in themſelves <hi>alterius fori,</hi> but likewayes there was an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Lybel raiſed againſt the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander,</hi> and without any Citation given to him thereupon, or Copy, Sight or Notice given to him thereof, Witneſſes are examined, then all which there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in judicial Procedures more Partial, Pernicious, and Unjuſt. And Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot</hi> having appealed from the Presbytery to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly; the Presbytery notwithſtanding thereof proceeded, and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:54226:4"/>
found the Lybel Relevant and Proven; and therefore, and in regard of Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi>'s Contumacy (as they termed his Appeal to the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, which ſat in <hi>October</hi> laſt) they Suſpended him from the Miniſtry, and referred him for farther Cenſure to the General Aſſembly. But the General Aſſembly having found no Contumacy in the Appeal, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred him to the Synod. And now the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> does again Appeal from the Synod, and from any Sentence they shall give in this Matter, to the next lawful General Aſſembly, and in the mean time, to Their Majeſties Protection for Juſtice and Relief. For thir Grounds and Reaſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Primo,</hi> There being a Petition given in by the Heretors and Parochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> to the Synod, atteſting, the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> his Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in the Miniſtry, and his Innocency as to the things Lybelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; and craving, that according to the Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> the Depoſitions of the Witneſſes might be made patent, that they might be the better Redargued; yet the Synod ſuffered not the ſaid Petition to be read.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secundo,</hi> The ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> having repreſented to the Synod the foreſaid Procedure of the Presbytery againſt him, and having craved that the Depoſitions of the Witneſſes, might be read before him, and that he might have a Coppy of the Additional Lybel, which he had never ſeen; and that conform to the Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> the Depoſitions of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes might be made patent to him, to the end that he might have a Copy thereof, to the effect he might the better clear himſelf, from any thing that may ſeem to be deponed againſt him; yet notwithſtanding thereof, (and contrare to Law) the ſame was alſo refuſed by the Synod, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly for this Reaſon, That the Probation was weak, and might not abide the Light nor Trial, for <hi>Veritas non quaerit Angulos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tertio,</hi> The ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> having repreſented to the Synod, That he was informed that one of the Articles deponed againſt him, was, That he should have danced about a Bonfire the 14 of <hi>October</hi> 1688. And that the ſame was the only Article proven againſt him, which he inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dargued, for the ſaid 14 day of <hi>October</hi> 1688<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fell upon a Sunday, and that the Witneſſes and hail Inhabitants of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> cannot but declare, that there was never Bonfires at <hi>Dalkeith</hi> upon a Sunday, ſo that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned falſly. And the Dancing about a Bonfire being ſo publick an Act, that not only the Witneſſes that have deponed it, but likewayes many others would have ſeen it, and all the Inhabitants of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> would have heard of it, if it had been true: Yet notwithſtanding thereof, all the Neighbours to that Bonfire, and hail Inhabitants of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> will
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54226:5"/>
declare and depone, that they neither ſaw nor heard of their Miniſter dancing at that, or any other Bonfire; yet notwithſtanding of that clear Conviction, and redarguing of that Article, the Synod had no regard there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, affirming that there was no help for it now, it being ſo deponed; which is no other thing, than as if they had ſaid, that they were not concerned thô it were falſe, for it was ſo deponed; and which is ſo conſequential to a clear and poſitive Redarguing, and Improbation of the Article, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation thereof, that the prejudice and deſign of the Synod to proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> upon whatever was alledged, althô without probation, or upon a Redargued Probation, is evidently manifeſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quarto,</hi> The ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> repreſented to the Synod, that he bad formerly Appealled from the Presbytry, and that it was but too evident from what is above narrated, that they were his Party. And which was farther demonſtrate from this. That, the ſaid Presbytery and <hi>Alexander Calderwood,</hi> did in face of the Synod not only interrupt the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> when he was ſpeaking; but likewayes debated and reaſoned againſt him as Parties, ſo that it could not but be expected, but that they would do more when he was removed out of the Synod, and therefore the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> declined the Presbytery and <hi>Alexander Calderwood</hi> as his Judges, and craved that they might not ſit to judge him; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding thereof, againſt all Law and Juſtice, they were not removed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quinto,</hi> Several Members of the Synod interrupted the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> while he was Vindicating himſelf, in the face of the Synod, and craving a ſight of the Additional Lybel, and Depoſition of the Witneſſes; And cryed out, That <hi>the ſame should not be granted to him,</hi> as if every one of them had had a Deciſive Voice, and which is without Example in any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory, for any of the Judges to interrupt the Defenders ſpeaking, and to cry out their Opinion, or rather Sentence, before the Defender be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; And which openly diſcovers their Prejudice, Deſign and Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of proceeding againſt the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander,</hi> altho' without juſt cauſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sexto.</hi> The Prejudice and Deſign of the Synods proceeding againſt the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander,</hi> on the ſaid lame, weak, and null probation, is evident, in ſo far as ſeveral Members of their Number did ſpeak and deal with him to dimitt, or that otherwayes they would depoſe him. And there is no thing more certain, than that they would never have Dealt with him to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt, if the Probation againſt him had been good; Their malice to the <hi>Regular Clergie</hi> being ſuch, as that they would rather Depoſe them for Immoralities, and Errors in Doctrine to Publish them, than to ſuffer them to dimit, and get off without ſtaine, when they are guilty of the ſame.

But Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> being Conſcious of his own Innocency refuſed to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, but rather to ſuffer their Extremity, from which he hoped GOD in his good time would Vindicate him. And therefore it being evident from the Grounds forſaid, that the Synod has behaved themſelves moſt partially, and againſt all Law and Form: The ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> does therefore Proteſt againſt the Synods further Proceeding in the ſaid Matter, and appeals from them, and from any ſentence they shall give therein, to the next <hi>General Aſſemblie,</hi> And to their MAJESTIES Protection, for Juſtice, and Relief in the mean time; And Proteſts, That the ſaid Lybels, and Witneſſes Depoſitions taken thereupon, may be preſerved, and not put out of the way, That ſo the ſame (and not Copies thereof) may be produced to the next <hi>General Aſſembly</hi>; Or to any their <hi>Majesties</hi> shall be pleaſed, out of their Royal Authority, to appoint to conſider the ſame: And that as the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> will publish and diſperſe his Appeal, and his Anſwers to the firſt Lybel; Which he only did ſee for his own Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from any ſentence that shall follow thereupon; So he expects, and earneſtly Deſires, that the ſaid Synod may Print both the Lybels againſt him, and Depoſitions taken thereupon, for vindication of their Juſtice, (if they can conceive they have done right) But which Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> hopes will rather vindicate his Innocency. And further, Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> Craves, and Proteſts, That this his Appeal may be inſert in the Books of the Synod.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding of the Appeals foreſaid, the Synod proceeded, and Depoſed the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> from his Miniſtrie, And thereupon the Eldership of the Parish was invaded, and ſome few, (ſeverals of them ſcarce worth to be noticed as Reſidenters, have uſurped the power of electing Elders, and have elected many moe than the number formerly uſed, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely as they think, to make the greater Figure; altho but of the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable of the Paroch; And of Deſign to Call, Impoſe, and Obtrude a Miniſter upon the Reſt againſt their will, contrary to the Laws of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, Practices of Chriſtian Churches, and profeſſion of Presbyterians; Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot</hi> his Appeal does preſerve his Right, and keeps all in <hi>ſtatu quo,</hi> the time of the Appeal, while it be diſcuſt.</p>
               <p>Whereupon, not only the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot,</hi> but likewiſe the Heritors and Parishioners of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> have given in a Petition to the Lords of their <hi>Majeſties</hi> moſt Honourable Privy Council, That they may be pleaſed to diſcharge the Calling of a Miniſter while the Appeal be diſcuſt; And that in the mean time, he may be reſtored to the Exercile of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrie. And that the Presbytrie of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> And others havers of the Lybels
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54226:6"/>
given in againſt him, and Depoſitions of the Witneſſes may make the ſame patent to him, as Law appoints; That he may know what is lybel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, or may ſeem to be proven, to the effect he may the better clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the ſamen, which is nothing but falſe lyes and calumnies: And whereof ſeveral of the Presbyterian Miniſters, who have ſeen the Lybels and Depoſitions, Affirm, that there is nothing proven. But the dancing about the Bon-Fire, which is not only clearly redargued to be falſe as ſaid is, there being no Bonfires either on the foreſaid day, nor for ſeveral moneths either before or after; But likewiſe if the perſons who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned it were known, and re-examined, it will be found, they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned falſly; And that they have been dealt with ſo to Depone; And that this Falshood may not be diſcovered, not only are the Depoſitions kept up, contrary to expreſs Law and Act of Parliament; But likewiſe, no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice can be gotten who were the perſons who have deponed it, that they may be inſiſted againſt.</p>
               <p>Whereas it is pretended, That the Lords of their <hi>Majeſties</hi> Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, are not Judges competent to the ſentences of <hi>Eccleſiastick Courts,</hi> and that as they cannot put in Miniſters in Churches, ſo they cannot meddle with ſentences of Depoſitions. It is anſwered, 1 <hi>mo.</hi> That be the 1: <hi>Act</hi> 8 <hi>Parl: Ja</hi>: 6: It is Statute and Ordained, <hi>That his Majestie, and Council shall be Judges competent, To all perſons Spiritual and Temporal, in all matters.</hi> And to pretend, that the Council is not Judge competent to ſentences of <hi>Eccleſiaſtick Courts,</hi> is no other then to affirm, <hi>That theſe Courts have an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary power, and may do wrong at their pleaſure without Remeed or control.</hi> For it is evident, That Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> is moſt unjuſtly purſued and Depoſed. And it is alſo evident, that if it be not Redreſſed be the Council, he will never be Reſtored be thoſe Miniſters, who have dealt ſo unjuſtly with him.</p>
               <p>And whereas, it is alledged, <hi>That as the Council cannot put in Miniſters, ſo they cannot meddle with ſentences of Depoſition.</hi> It is anſwered, That the Council has not the power of Admiſſion and Ordination of Miniſters. But if a Miniſter having a lawful Call, the Presbyterie should refuſe to Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit and Ordain him, albeit they have nothing to object againſt him, upon Application to the Council or Seſſion, Letters will be direct to Charge the Presbyterie, to Admit and Ordain him, but <hi>multo magis</hi> in this caſe, where a Miniſter is Depoſed from his Miniſtrie, as likewiſe from his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice, (which is his Livelyhood and Maintenance) And yet moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly, and without Ground or Reaſon; The Council is moſt proper Judge, for Reſtoring him againſt the foreſaid Oppreſſion, Injurie and Unjuſt Sentence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:54226:6"/>And for a further evidence of this unjuſt Sentence, it is Humbly deſired, that the Lords of Their Majeſties Privy Council will be pleaſed to take notice, That in the firſt Lybel there are many Articles which are not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levant; And it is ſaid, that there is none of them proven, but the Danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about the Bonfire: And yet the Presbytery by their Sentence, found the Lybel Relevant and Proven, which muſt be underſtood as to the hail Articles of the Lybel complexlie, then which there is nothing more falſe as will appear by the Lybels and Depoſitions, if they were produced. And yet thereupon Mr <hi>Heriot</hi> is firſt ſuſpended be the Presbytery, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred be them to the General Aſſembly for further Cenſure, as if great Immorralities in Life, and Errours in Doctine, had been proven againſt him. And the Synod (to which the Aſſembly remitted him) following the ſteps of the Presbytery, depoſed him. Now when Presbytery and Synod, have acted thus contrary to expreſs Law, and have done open and manifeſt Unjuſtice; (and whereof all that heard of it are convinced and ſenſible) And having ſtated themſelves Parties againſt him, there can be no Remedie expected from the ſaid Unjuſtice, Injury, and Oppreſſion, unleſs the Lords of Their Majeſties Privy Council interpoſe their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>If it be alledged, That be the late Act of Parliament, The Act of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy in Church matters is Reſcinded; It is Anſwered, That the Act of Parliament 1669 is Reſcinded, which extended the Supremacy, to the Ordering and Diſpoſal of the External Government and Policy of the Church, and to the Enacting of Conſtitutions, Acts, and Orders in the Church. But the foreſaid Act of K: <hi>Ja</hi>: 6 his 8 Parliament, is not Reſcind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is only as to the Judging of <hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi> Perſons in matters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained upon, And which power is inherent to the Crown, otherwayes there should be <hi>Regnum in Regno</hi>; And Church Judicatories should have Arbitrary power, without Redreſs or Control, as ſaid is.</p>
               <closer>In Regard whereof, The Lords of Their MAJESTIES Privy Council are Judge Competent, to this Injurie, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſtice and Oppreſſion; And the Deſire of the Petitions ought to be Granted.</closer>

            <head>A short Relation of the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> their procedure in Reference to the Sentencing of Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot</hi> and their planting of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Dalkeith.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is not to be doubted, but that a late Pamphlet called <hi>An Information for Mr. Alexander Heriot</hi> (Deſigned) Miniſter <hi>at Dalkeith,</hi> hath ſpread through a great part of this Kingdom; and it may perhaps be thought ſtrange, that none of the Members either of the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> or Synod of <hi>Louthian</hi> and <hi>Tweddale,</hi> have appeared to vindicate the Innocency of theſe Judicatories, and to wipe off the ſoul Aſperſions caſt upon them by that defamatory Paper. But the truth is, an Anſwer to that Paper was prepared about four Moneths ago, and the Reaſon why the publication thereof was at that time delayed, was becauſe it was judged convenient to know the mind of the Synod (whoſe integrity was alſo queſtioned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached by the Informer) before any Anſwer to that Paper should be emitted. But the Synod ſitting in May laſt, and judging the Calumnies of that Paper obvious enough, declined to trouble themſelves with any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view thereof as a thing not worthy of their time: But ſome of the Synod put it in the hands of a Perſon, whoſe acquaintance with the proceſs of Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> qualified him to deſcry the Informers lies thereanent. And again, this Perſon being diverted with a throng of buſineſs, till the Plantation of the Kirk of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> was near an Iſſue, it was thought expedient ſtill to forebear the Anſwer of that Paper, till the Anſwerer might be able to give a joynt view of the proceſs of Mr. <hi>Heriot,</hi> and of the method taken for the ſettlement of the Paroch of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> with a qualifyed Miniſter: Which being now brought to an happy Period, it ſeems high time, after ſo long forbearance, to undeceive all that are willing to know the truth; and to give in the firſt place a compendious, but diſtinct account of the Proceſs, and then refell the Informers miſ-repreſentation of the ſame, only let this be premitted, that the reaſon why the names of the Witneſſes are not expreſt, the Reader will find in the Anſwer to the Information.</p>
            <p>To begin with the Proceſs then, the Reader may remember that the Act of Parliament Reſtoring Presbyterial Government Authorized the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Meeting of Miniſters and Elders to Purge the Church of Miniſters
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54226:7"/>
that were Inſufficient, or Scandalous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Either by themſelves or ſuch as they should appoint. Whereupon the General Meeting enjoyned Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods and Presbyteries to receive Lybels againſt any Incumbent within their reſpective Bounds, and to call for Aſſiſtants from Neighbouring Presbyteries or Synods to concurr with them in judging the ſame: In com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance wherewith, when the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> received any Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation againſt any of the late Conformiſts within their Bounds, they did not proceed without the aſſiſtance of ſome from the Presbyteries of <hi>Edinburgh</hi> and <hi>Haddingtoun</hi>; and particularly when the Proceſs of Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> was led before them, which proceeded thus.</p>
            <p>Upon the 7<hi>th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1690. An Information or Lybel was given to the Presbytery againſt Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot</hi> then Incumbent at <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> which being judged Relevant, Citation was appointed to be given him to compear againſt that day eight dayes; at which day Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot</hi> did perſonally compear, heard his Lybel read, received a double thereof, and was granted a competent time to anſwer it, <hi>viz.</hi> till the 28<hi>th</hi> day of the ſaid moneth of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> unto which day he was ſummoned <hi>apud Acta</hi> to compear again and give in his anſwers. But on that day, the Viſitation (conſiſting of the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and aſſiſtance from the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries of <hi>Haddingtoun</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh</hi>) being conſtitute, and Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> Legally called, he did not perſonally compear; but for him appeared one Mr. <hi>James Hamiltoun</hi> alledging a Commiſſion from Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot</hi> to compear in his name, and deſiring to know who were his Accuſers, that they might ſubcribe his Lybel. The Copy of Mr. <hi>Hamiltouns</hi> Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or procuratory follows, which the Reader is deſired to conſider, becauſe that Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> in his Information, and in his Appeal from the Synod, calls it an Appeal from the Presbytery, and improves it under this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>

            <p>The Presbytery and aſſiſtance having conſidered this Paper, wherein Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> does decline the Presbytery in moſt contemptible Expreſſions, thought it not proper to Debate with Mr. <hi>James Hamiltoun in Cauſa,</hi> nor yet to admit of any Procuratory, nor of Accuſers, or any under that Character to ſubſcribe the Information or Lybel; and alſo conſidering that Mr. <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot</hi> did not compear perſonally as he was obliged, thought fit forthwith to proceed to the leading of Witneſſes: for, though the Declinator yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſufficient ground of Cenſure, yet to prevent all Clamours, it was thought expedient to try the truth of the Lybel.</p>
            <p>The Officer, having been appointed to cite Witneſſes, gave in his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, which being read, the Witneſſes were called, and all who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, after invocating the Name of God, were Sworn and purged of malice and partial Counſel; and being ſeverally examined, the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and their aſſiſtants collated their Depoſitions, and applying them to the ſeveral Articles of the Lybel, they found ſeveral Articles duely proven, as follows.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Extravagant Lightneſs in Dancing about a Bon-fire publickly on the ſtreet with Pipe and Drum and Drinking an Health upon his Knees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For inſtructing this Article three witneſſes, being examined, in their Depoſitions they concurr, That they ſaw Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot</hi> dance about a Bonfire in the publick Streets of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> with Pipe and Drum and drink an Health upon his Knees. What is alledged by the informer againſt this Article and to invalidate the teſtimonies of the Witneſſes is afterwards conſidered and anſwered.</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:54226:8"/>To this Article deponed <hi>ſix</hi> Witneſſes all concurring that Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot</hi> admitted to the Lords Table Scandalous perſons and two condeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend upon the inſtance of <hi>John Dickſon,</hi> and four, whereof two, are Elders pitched upon <hi>Andrew Nivil</hi> beſides other Scandalous perſons named.</p>
            <p>This Article alone, being thus fully proven makes Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Sentence of Depoſition eſpecially becauſe there is an Act of the General Aſſembly <hi>Anno.</hi> 1598 Ratified by the Aſſem. <hi>Anno</hi> 1638. for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing ſuch prophaners of the Lords Table.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Touching this Article: two Witneſſes agreed that upon the Sabbath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly preceeding the day that the Oath of Abjuration was tendered, Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot</hi> did threaten all with pain of death that should refuſe it. Four concurred in this, that Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> preſſed his Parishioners to ſwear ſeveral Oaths, whereof one was Sinful and Illegal as the Oath that they should not lift Arms againſt the King nor any Commiſſionate by Him, <hi>upon any pretext whatſomever.</hi> Others were captious, as who and how many had been lodged by them ſince <hi>November</hi> preceeding, and the like. Others deponed that he threatned them with impriſonment in caſe they refuſed to Swear.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>His Scandalous and Impudent Railing from the Pulpit upon particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Higheſt note, as the late Duke of</hi> Monmouth, <hi>the late East of</hi> Argyle, <hi>and the Earle of</hi> Melvill <hi>his Majeſties High Commiſsioner and Others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Seven or Eight Witneſſes agree in this, that from the Pulpit in the year Eightie three Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot</hi> Railed againſt <hi>Monmouth, Argyle,</hi> and <hi>Melvil,</hi> calling one of them a Bloody <hi>Abſalon,</hi> another Hereditary Trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, another Rebel and Diſturbers of our <hi>Iſrael</hi> and other ſtuff to this purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>His rejoycing and shewing evidences of cheerfulneſs at the News of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of the Kings Army at Gillicrankie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three Witneſſes being examined concurred in this that Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot,</hi> at the News of the Defeat of the Kings Forces at <hi>Gillicrankie</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſignal evidences of his Joy and Satisfaction, and cauſed give the Reporter thereof a Drink. And shall he that is Glad at Calamities paſs unpunished.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>That in his ſeeming Obſervance of the late publick Thankſgiving for the Preſervation of their Majeſties Perſons and Government, the Defeat of the</hi> Irish <hi>Armie, and diſcovery of the late Plot he, made no mention of any of them, either in Praying or Preaching, whereby there was plain diſſembling with God and Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three Witneſſes having deponed concurr in this, that on the late publick Thankſgiving, enjoyned by Authority Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot</hi> did

neither by any preliminary Diſcourſe, nor in Sermon or Prayer, make any mention of the Defeat of the <hi>Irish</hi> Armie, the preſervation of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Perſons and Government nor of the diſcovery of the late Bloody Plot.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>His perſcuting of Sober People in his paroch for their Presbyterian Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi> Four Witneſſes agree in this, that by Mr. <hi>Aelxander Heriots</hi> Inſtigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and influence upon the Magiſtrates, ſome were Fyned and forced to fly the place for Baptizing their Children with Presbyterian Miniſters.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Negligence of Diſcipline in the caſe of groſs Scandals.

            </p>
            <p>Three Witneſſes concurr that <hi>William Gardiner, William Sadler,</hi> and <hi>John Dickſone</hi> were guilty of Fornication and yet had from Mr. <hi>Alexander Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot</hi> the benifite of a ſealing Ordinance without ſatisfaction previouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. And as to the particular inſtance above mentioned, four or five Witneſſes deponed, that they ſaw <hi>Janet Somervels</hi> firſt Husband after she was Married to <hi>Thomas Finlaw.</hi> It was alſo deponed, not only that this was notourly known, but alſo came to Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> Ears, and one, at leaſt, of his Elders deponed that he knew no diligence done for cenſuring either of them. The ſame was declared by the parties themſelves.</p>
            <p>There were other two Articles proven in the proceſs which being of leſſer weight, for Brevities ſake shall be omitted.</p>
            <p>When the Presbytery and aſſiſtants had ſeriouſly, and a long time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated upon this whole proceſs, that they might not proceed rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a matter of moment they delayed to paſs any Sentence till another day.</p>
            <p>Upon the twelvth day of <hi>September.</hi> The Presbytery and aſſiſtants did again reviſe, cognoſce and judge upon the whole proceſs, and firſt they judged Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot</hi> upon the account of his declinator and reſt of his conduct to be contumacious; and then having deliberately adviſed the articles of the Lybel with the depoſitions adduced to inſtruct the ſame, they concluded him to be cenſurable, and therefore did Suſpend him from all Miniſterial function, and referred him for further Cenſure to the next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewing General Aſſembly, or next Synod of <hi>Louthian</hi> and <hi>Tweddal,</hi> if either of theſe should judge him farther Cenſurable. And ſo tender were they of Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot,</hi> that notwithſtanding of his declinator, yet before ſentence paſt they called him, and alſo ſent to his Houſe, to hear if he had ought to alledge why ſentence should not be pronounced: But
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54226:9"/>
he did not Compear. And therefore after Sentence an Extract thereof was preſently ſent to him. And upon the whole I darre appeal to any Perſon whom prejudice hath not Blinded, whither or not the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> and Aſſiſtants joyned with them, have not proceeded upon a relevant Lybel and plenary Probation: And alſo with that Candor, Singleneſs, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, as becomes in a Caſe of ſuch Weight.</p>

But notwithſtanding thereof, according to the truſt committed unto them by the Aſſembly, the Synod conſidered and reviſed the whole proceſs, and pronounced Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Depoſition againſt Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot,</hi> and appointed one of the Members of the Presbytery of <hi>Dalketth,</hi> to intimate the ſaid Sentence the next Lords day, and to declare the Church of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> Vacant.</p>
            <p>After this the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> finding the Church of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant; in order to the legal ſettlement thereof, proceeded to the Election of a Seſſion after this manner. They appointed one of their own number to Preach there upon a Lords day, and after the Sermon publickly to deſire the <hi>Heritors</hi> and heads of Families to meet upon a convenient day (which was alſo ſpecially condeſcended upon) to make a liſt of Perſons fit to be Elders and Deacons in that Paroch. Which liſt being brought to the Presbytery and the Perſons Nominate being tryed, an edict for them was publickly ſerved in the Church of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and being returned to the Presbytery, no objection was alledged againſt any Perſon named in the liſt, only a Proteſtation was made in behalf of Mr, <hi>Alexander Heriot,</hi> againſt the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any Eldership there, upon pretence of his ſtanding Relation to that Congregation. But the ground of that Proteſtation being null, the Pres<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bytery did forthwith appoint one of their number upon a Lords day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to preach in the Church of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and with the uſual Solemnities to ordain the Perſons named in the Liſt, to be Elders and Deacons there: Which was accordingly done upon the Eight of <hi>February,</hi> of this preſent year of God, 1691.</p>
            <p>This (it ſeems) did alarum Mr, <hi>Alexander Heriot:</hi> For shortly after
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54226:10"/>
ſome Perſon (<hi>I</hi> shall not ſay, <hi>ex foece Populi</hi>: But who ſeems to be neither Divine nor Lawyer) hath had the imprudence, or rather the impudence, to cauſe Print Reaſons of <hi>Mr. Heriots</hi> appeal from the Synod and ſome Notes in Relation to the Presbyteries procedure againſt him, whereby his caſe is moſt groſly miſrepreſented: Yet thereupon does he Petition their <hi>Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties privy Council,</hi> as the Judges competent, to repone him to the exerciſe of his Miniſtry and to interpoſe their Authority in diſcharging to call any Miniſter to the Church of <hi>Dalkeith.</hi> But <hi>the Right Honourable the Lords of their Majeſties Privy Council,</hi> knowing their duty better then Mr. <hi>Heriot,</hi> or his Advocates can inform them. And conſidering the extent of the power belonging to the civil Magiſtrate in ſuch caſes, did by their Act dated the 17. day of <hi>March,</hi> 1691, (contrary to Mr, <hi>Heriots</hi> expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) only recommend to the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> Synod of <hi>Lothian</hi> and next General Aſſembly reſpective, before whom the proceſs and Sentence of depoſition was led and pronounced againſt the ſaid Mr. <hi>Heriot,</hi> to reviſe and reconſider the ſame, and to do all Juſtice thereupon to him according to Law. And to have due regard, how, and in what manner the Church of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> should be legally provided of a Miniſter.</p>
            <p>Now Mr. <hi>Heriot,</hi> having miſſed the mark he aimed at by this arrow dipt in Poyſon, and reſolving to trample upon all Government Civil and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtick, not only continues to dwell ſtill in the manſs whereto now he hath no real right, but in the hight of contempt, hath therein erected a meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, where he exerciſes all parts of the Miniſterial function, to the great diſturbance, not only of the Town of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> but alſo of the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey round about.</p>
            <p>Conform unto the Interloquitor of the Privy Council, and in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance therewith, the Synod of <hi>Lothian</hi> and <hi>Tweddale,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>May,</hi> did again diligently peruſe the whole proceſs of Mr. <hi>Alexander He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot,</hi> reconſidered the Probation. And having reviſed the ſame publickly, found no ground to make any alteration in the former Sentence, but did by an unanimous Vote, adhere to and ratify the ſame; and appointed a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of their number to intimate their adherence to, and ratification of it, in the Pulpit of <hi>Dalkeith.</hi> And appointed the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> to have ſpecial regard to the Paroch of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and to plant the ſame with their firſt Conveniency.</p>
            <p>Upon the eight of <hi>June</hi> a Gentleman preſented to the Presbytery a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from my Lord <hi>Raith.</hi> dated at <hi>Mommeal</hi> 30. <hi>May</hi> 1691. And directed to the <hi>Moderator</hi> of the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> to be communicated to the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and parochin of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> bearing that the <hi>Dutches of Buccleuch</hi> (ſince the Church of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> is Vacant) recommends Mr. <hi>William Mein</hi> to be Miniſter of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54226:10"/>
               <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and gives her Graces conſent to him to be admitted there. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with joyned an Elder of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> shewing that the Seſſion there inclined to chooſe Mr. <hi>William Mein</hi> for their Miniſter; whereupon the Presbytery appointed one of their number to goe to <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and after due intimation given to the Heretours and Elders to meet upon a convenient day, to meet with them and according to order to preſide in the Election, and Call, of a Miniſter. At the next Dyet of the Presbytery, the Brother reported that according to appointment he had ſeen the plurality of the Heretours and all the Elders of the Parish of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> ſubſcribe a Call to Mr <hi>William Meine.</hi> And withall that ſome of the Heretores and others came in, and Subſcribed a Paper which they ſaid was a Call to Mr. <hi>James Lundie</hi> Miniſter at <hi>North-Leith</hi> to be their Miniſter, in the mean time proteſting that it was without prejudice to Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriot</hi> his Right, which proteſtation made him conclude that they were not in earneſt, and therefore to take no notice of what they did. After this report appeared two of the Ruling Elders of the Parish of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> with a full Commiſſion preſenting a Call to Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Mein</hi> ſubſcribed, atteſted, and duly endorſed upon the back, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating the <hi>Presbytery</hi> to proſecute the ſaid Call with all expedition. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared alſo two Gentlemen or three, from the Parish of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> with ſome Papers, alledging they had a Call to Mr. <hi>Lundie.</hi> But being demanded if they had any Commiſſion, plainly anſwered they had none, Wherefore the Presbytery finding that they pretended to repreſent a <hi>Community,</hi> and yet had no Commiſſion to negotiate in their name, thought it not fit to enter upon the cauſe with them. And therefore finding no competition in this pretended Call, judged themſelves oblidged to proſecute the Call given to Mr. <hi>William Mein.</hi> And to that effect appointed two or three of their number, with ſome of the Seſſion of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> to go, and in their name, and in name of the ſaid Seſſion, to tender the Call to the ſaid Mr. <hi>William Mein,</hi> and one of them to Preach and ſerve Mr. <hi>Meins</hi> edict at the Kirk of <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keith</hi> next Sabbath, being the 21. of <hi>June.</hi> When the execution of the Edict was returned. There appeared two or three Perſons and gave in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt Mr. <hi>Mein</hi> his being Miniſter of <hi>Dalkeith:</hi> appeared alſo one <hi>Mungo Strachan,</hi> and in Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> name proteſted againſt both the Calls given to Mr. <hi>Mein,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lundie</hi>; when the Presbytery had duly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the objections they anſwered them as follows.</p>

            <head>OBJECTIONS, by the Heretors and Elders of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> againſt the Call given to Mr. <hi>William Mein,</hi> to be Miniſter at <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and appeal thereupon.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>FIrst the ſaid Call is null, becauſe it is given by ſome Perſons as Elders, and Deacons, who are neither Elders nor Deacons, for the Kirk-Seſſion was not diſolved by the pretended Depoſition of Mr.</hi> Alexander Heriot <hi>the Miniſter. But the ſaid Seſſion ſtands and continues while a Miniſter be ſettled in the Kirk, and untill the Minister and Seſſion choiſe a new one; and as there was no ſettled Minister at this pretended Election, ſo there was none of the Seſſion thereat, but two Perſons, and the reſt of the Electors were for the moſt part of the meaneſt of the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2. Although the Seſſion had been Lawfully Elected and conſtitute as it is not, yet the Call, is null: in ſo for as it is given by Deacons, for by the Act of Parliament the Righe and priviledge of calling of Miniſters is given to Heretors and Elders, and not to Deacons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>No reſpect can be had to the ſaid Call, in ſo far as it proceeds from many Perſons, who are neither Heretors nor Elders. For</hi> 1ſt. <hi>Although the Act of Parliament require the approbation of the Parochiners to the Call given by the Heretors and Elders, yet it does not give to the Parishiners a Right and Priviledge of Calling. But in caſe of the Pariſhiners their not approbation of the Call given by the Heretors and Elders, In that caſe the Heretors and Elders, are to call another Preſon, ſo that this Call: In ſo fare as it is given by Parochiners it is not to be reſpected,</hi> 2dly, <hi>The ſaid Call and Approbation thereof is null, in ſo far at it is given by Tutors and Curators of Minors, at leaſt by Curators without the Minors, whom they could only Authorize therein, or by Perſons as Tutors and Curators, who have not accepted theſe Offices upon them, or by Servants, or hy Women, becauſe that by the Act of Parliament, as none of thoſe Perſons has the Right and Priviledge to call a Miniſter; So it requires not their Approbation to the ſaid Call.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4, <hi>And as the forſaid Call given to Mr.</hi> Mein. <hi>is a Null Call for the reaſons forſaids, ſo likewiſe it cannot be admitted in competition with the Call given to Mr.</hi> James Lundie <hi>Minister at</hi> North-Leith <hi>for the Reaſons following.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1, <hi>Becauſe the call given to</hi> Mr. Lundie <hi>is by the far greateſt and beſt part of the Heretors and Elders, and which is likwiſe approven by the far greateſt and best part of the reſt of the Houſholders, to which likwiſe the approbation of the far greateſt number of the Servants and Women in the Paroch can be had, if it were neceſſary whereas the call given to</hi> Mr. Meen <hi>is by very few of the Heretors and Elders and few of thoſe of any conſideration, and by the other perſons foreſaids whi are
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54226:11"/>
likewiſe in a mean condition, and has not the right and priviledge to Call.</hi> 2. Mr, Lundie, <hi>was formerly Miniſter at</hi> Dalkeith, <hi>a Perſon above all excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and eminent in Learning, Ability in Preaching, Piety, Charity and in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in all the parts of the Miniſterial Function, and of ſingular and exemplar Life and Converſation, whom the Heretor, Elders, and Parishoners of</hi> Dalkeith <hi>know, and by whom they have been greatly edified, whereas</hi> Mr. Mein. <hi>Is not known to them, and is of meaner Gifts and Abilities and who was rejected and refuſed by other obſcure Parishes, And by whom they cannot be edified, ſo that be ought not to be impoſed and intruded upon them, which will Infalliblly prove as incomfortable to him, as troubleſome to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And therefore the Heretors and Elders, who has called,</hi> Mr. Lundie <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts as formerly againſt the foreſaid unlawful Call, given to the ſaid Mr.</hi> William Mein, <hi>and againſt the Presbyteries proceedings upon the ſaid Call and appeals as formerly from the Presbyterie to the next Synod and to their Majesties, and Lords of their Majeſties Privy Council for juſtice and relief therein in the mean time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To the firſt it was Anſwered that the Presbytery is ſatisfied as to the Legality of the Election of the Eldership, and that they own no Eldership there, but that which was erected by them. And that becauſe the Act of Parliament reſtoring Presbytery, did put the Government in their hands, and ſuch as should be raceived by them, and that there is no need of of a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Miniſter in order to the Election of an Eldership.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond it was anſwered that the ſubſcriptions of Deacons is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cumulative, and <hi>ex abundantia,</hi> they ſubſcribing only as Conſenters, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit the calling of a Miniſter be lodged in the Heretors and Elders, yet no Law inhibits other parishoners to teſtify their approbation of the thing by their manual ſubſcriptions to the Call.</p>
            <p>To the 3, which hath two Branches, it was anſwered and 1<hi>st</hi> To the firſt Branch as was above anſwered to the 2<hi>d</hi> Objection Moreover it were no ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leciſm tho' all the heads of Families within the Parish had ſubſcribed. 2. To the other Branch, it were tedious and would prove unneceſary to canvaſs every individual ſubſcription, but the Presbytery has done nothing in this caſe, but what the Law allows and is commonly practiſed.</p>
            <p>To the 4<hi>th</hi> wherein a competition is alledged to be between the Call given to Mr. <hi>William Mein</hi> and another given to Mr. <hi>James Lundie,</hi> its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered there is no ſuch competition, there being no Legal Call at all to Mr. <hi>Lundie,</hi> as appears from what is above mentioned. And it may be thought Strange why Gentlemen who (its hoped) doe value both their own, and Mr. <hi>Lundie</hi>'s credit doe borrow his name to a mock Call, and urge it in a matter ſo ſerious and weighty: For whatever Strangers not knowing
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54226:12"/>
the caſe may be made to believe: Yet the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> know That the very Gentlemen that preſented this alledged Call, did before them judicially confeſs that there only deſign was but to prevent the <hi>jus Devolutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis.</hi> But to come to the Reaſons alledging Mr. <hi>Lundie</hi>'s Call to be preferable to the other. 1. To the firſt its anſwered, that all the Elders ſubſcribe Mr. <hi>Meins</hi> Call, and none Mr. <hi>Lundie</hi>'s, and that the Presbytery underſtands Mr. <hi>Meins</hi> Call to be ſubſcribed by the moſt conſiderable part of the Heretours, eſpecially the Dutches of <hi>Buccleuch,</hi> who is the cheif Heretour, having given conſent to it by her Grace's Honourable Commiſſioners. To the 2<hi>d.</hi> Its anſwered 1. That whatever relation Mr. <hi>Lundie</hi> might have had to the Parish of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> formerly, yet he hath none at preſent. 2. That tho' the Presbytery thinks it not fit to compare Mr. <hi>Meins,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lundie</hi>'s Gifts or other endowments together, nor yet to flater the one and derogat from the other: Yet they are ſatisfied with the Miniſterial qualifications of Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Mein,</hi> as alſo with his practice, Converſation, and fitneſs for the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish of <hi>Dalkeith.</hi> And the Presbytery makes no queſtion, but through the Bleſſing of God upon his Labours he may prove an uſeful Inſtrument in that Corner of our Lords Vinyeard. 3. Its a moſt calumnious untruth that ever Mr. <hi>William Mein</hi> was refuſed or rejected by any Parish, whether famous or obſcure. Whoſo are acquaint with him know that he is of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Spirit than to thruſt Himſelf upon a People that are not ſueing for Him. Neither is the Presbytery reſolved to intrude him upon the Parish of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> but fairly to ſettle him there, upon a Legal Call from the plura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Heretours and all the Elders. And as no faithful Miniſter of Chriſt can warrantably expect immunity from troubles, So its hoped God shall ſupport Mr. <hi>Mein</hi> under what he may meet with.</p>
            <p>The Presbytery having conſidered the Objections and found them by the Anſweres given to be non relevant and laying no weight on them, nor upon the proteſtation founded thereon, did without farther <hi>Demurr</hi> judicially tender the Call to Mr. <hi>William Mein,</hi> and upon his modeſt Submiſſion, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the day whereon he might be addmitted. And accordingly upon the Seventh of <hi>July</hi> 1691. After a Sermon Preached with Reference to the occaſion, Mr. <hi>William Mein</hi> was admitted Miniſter of the Goſpel at <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keith,</hi> in the Kirk of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> The Presbytery having given him the Right hand of Fellowship, and the Heretours and Elders having received him as their Miniſter.</p>
            <p>Its true the two Perſons above mentioned, and <hi>Mungo Strachan</hi> appeared upon this occaſion alſo, and renewed their reſpective proteſtations, but the Presbytery having anſwered them formerly, proceeded now notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereof.</p>

            <head>An Anſwer to <hi>Mr. Heriots</hi> Information.</head>
            <p>NOw for Anſwer to the Paper called <hi>Information for Mr.</hi> Alexander He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, wherein his Caſe and Cauſe is groſly miſ-repreſented, we ſay, with the wiſe man, <hi>He that is firſt in his own Cauſe ſeemeth just, but his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour cometh and ſearcheth him,</hi> and then there is a further diſcovery of Truth and Equity: and therefore although it would be both needleſs and nauſeous to give a particular and diſtinct Anſwer to every thing in that Printed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, yet for ſatisfaction of ſome that may be ignorant, or miſ-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and ſo puzled with many poſitive Aſſertions of great untruths, lies and calumnies therein contained, it is thought fit at preſent to remark theſe few things following in order, according to the Method of the foreſaid Information.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He calls the Synod of the three <hi>Louthians</hi> and <hi>Tweddale</hi> the Synod of <hi>Mid-Louthian</hi> only: Whereby in the very entry and Tittle of his Paper, he bewrayes no ſmall ignorance of the conſtitution and extent of the Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory from which he did appeal. It would ſeem that he is not well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint even with Names and Things, that he might eaſily have known long ago, and are of his concernment, to know. But this is a miſtake of ſo ſmall conſequence, that it would not have been worth the while to take any notice thereof, were it not for the preſage of it. <hi>Coeſpitare in limine mali ominis eſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. In his Information it ſelf then, one of the firſt things remarkable is the account he gives of the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith</hi>'s procedure againſt him: wherein among other things he ſaith that the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> refuſed to conſcend upon an Accuſer or Purſuer, or to allow any under that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to ſubſcribe the Lybel given againſt him. To which it is Anſwered. 1. That he Called for no Accuſers when he compeared perſonally before the Presbytery. 2. How conſonant ſoever ſuch methods of producing Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſers, may be to proceſſes before Civil Courts (where alſo in ſeveral caſes it is not required) yet the ſaid Presbytery did, and ſtill do judge that the formal appearing of Accuſers as ſuch in ordinary caſes of Scandal, to be ſome way unbeſeeming Church-Judicatories, who are called out of zea to the Glory of Chriſt, to inquire into the Scandals that fall out, within the bounds of their inſpection, even although their should be no Complainer, as is manifeſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. Whereas admitting of Accuſers commonly tends not to edification (the only end of Church Cenſures, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.10,) But to the begetting and cherishing bitigious debates, rancour and malice: As hath been
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54226:13"/>
too manifeſt in ſome late caſes. 3. The Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> have for their Vindication herein, both the ancient and uſual practice of the Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories of this Church, and the ſentiments of our worthy Predeceſſors: Witneſs <hi>Ames de conſeten. Lib.</hi> 5 <hi>Cap.</hi> 54. <hi>Qu:</hi> 4. And Mr. <hi>Durham</hi> in his Treatiſe Of Scandal, <hi>part,</hi> 2. <hi>Chap.</hi> 10. Yet 4. notwithſtanding of what was ſaid, there were two or three perſons ready to have ſubſcribed his Lybel, and to have appeared as his Accuſers, if need had been: But Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> pretended this by his withdrawing, and obſtinate declining of the Presbytery, and refuſing to appear before them: So that they could not produce his Accuſers before him, when he would not himſelf compear before them, ſo that his clamour about this, is groundleſs and unjuſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He ſaith that the Heretours and Parishoners of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> did by a write under their hands diſclaim and diſown the Lybel, except <hi>Alexander Calder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> and a few others <hi>ex faece populi. Anſ.</hi> 1. It is a notorious falshood. For Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> party gave no ſuch writing under their hands to the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery. 2 Though it were true, yet it makes nothing for his Vindication, nor againſt the truth of the Lybel given in againſt him, which he knows may be true, and well proven by plenty of Witneſſes; although as many thouſands as ſingle Perſons had diſowned it. Yet for further clearing of this particular, let it be conſidered, 1. That Mr. <hi>Mark Lermont</hi> with a confuſed Rable following him appeared, and by word of mouth diſowned the Lybel: Which shewed little either prudence or Piety, whither the ſaid Lybel were true or falſe: For (beſides that they knew not how it would be proven) if it were true, then their diſowning it, kithed little reſpect to their own ſpiritual thriving: But if falſe, then they ought rather to have furnished Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> with means to diſprove it. Yet to do them Juſtice, they appeared not with Mr. <hi>Heriot,</hi> but a fortnight after, they rushed in before the Presbytery when Mr. <hi>James Hamiltoun</hi> preſented Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> Declinature, And as they diſowned the Lybel, ſo they diſowned the Declinature. 2. I know no Heretors that appeared to diſown that Lybel except Mr. <hi>Mark Lermont</hi> be counted one before his Fathers Death. 3. The Parishoners who compeared were but a ſmall part of the Parish, and theſe alſo diſſaffected to the Government Civil and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick; and ſome of them Drunk, Tumultuous and Outragious: So that Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> has more cauſe to be ashamed, then to boaſt of their appearance and Teſtimony for him; for commonly perſons of that ſort give their Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony to ſuch as themſelves. 4. Their diſowning the Lybel before it was put to probation and trial, could not ſignify more, than either that they had no hand in giving it in, which may be true enough; or that they were not willing that Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> should be called in queſtion for any miſdemeanors
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54226:13"/>
whatſoever, and how far this may conduce for Mr <hi>Heriots</hi> Vindication, who can tell? 5. He alledges that only <hi>Alexander Calderwood</hi> and a few others owned it, and afterwards that <hi>Alexander Calderwood</hi> was the only Inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, thereby excluding theſe others ſeemingly: Which as it is both falſe and not coherent in its ſelf; ſo if it were true, it would make nothing for him: For if an Information or Lybel againſt a man be found relevant and true, the paucity of theſe that own it, ought not to hinder the guilty and Scandalous ſinner from meeting with deſerved Cenſure. He alledges that the Presbytery had no other Informer againſt him, but only <hi>Alexander Calderwood.</hi> But though this had been true (as it is not) yet had the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery been oblidged to receive a complaint from him alone, and to put the ſame to Trial: For if no complaint againſt a Miniſter could be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, except the plurality of his Parish did proſecute the ſame, the Church would quickly be peſtered with unfaithfull Teachers; becauſe the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel affords much Ground to believe, that the wicked and unſound Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors will in number always exceed the truly Godly: So that if a corrupt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor should get the corrupt part of his Parish (which will eaſily be found the greateſt) to befriend him, then there would be no acceſs to cenſure him: And how abſurd, and of what bad conſequence this would be, is obvious to any judicious Chriſtian to conſider· Beſides, it may here be remembred that Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> is of another Judgement than the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> about this Queſtion; for the Apoſtle 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5 19. Requires but two or three Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in order to the receiving an accuſation againſt an Elder: But Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> requires the plurality of the Parish in order to it; and quarrels with the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> for receiving an Accuſation againſt him from a few, as he alledges. 6. Whereas he would make the World believe that the Heretors and Parishoners are very unanimouſly for him; let it be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Cheif Heretor is not concerned, and that the Chief of the Heretors he boaſts of, has but a ſmally early rent in the Parish, beſides his dwelling houſe; and the reſt of his Heretours are yet more inconſiderable that way. 7. He ſaith, that theſe others who appeared againſt him, were <hi>ex foece populi</hi>: Why? Becauſe perhaps they are generally of the poorer ſort: Which though it were true, is no better help to his Cauſe, than to bewray in him a prophane Spirit, of the ſame ſtamp with theſe who count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Apoſtles of Chriſt (becauſe poor unlearned Men) to be the Filth of the World, and the off-ſcouring of all things 1. <hi>Cor</hi> 4.13. And it ſeems he has not well read, nor underſtood, <hi>Iam.</hi> 2, 4.5. Beſides it is well known, that not a few of theſe he ſpeaks ſo contemptibly and baſely of, yet for their temporal intereſt may vye with Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> Heretors: and for their ſenſe of Religon, Fear of God, and morality of Life, are very
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54226:14"/>
far above his <hi>flos populi</hi>; So that if it were known to the World, who they are whom Mr <hi>Heriot</hi> calls the dregs and off-ſcourings of the People, and who they are whom he reckons the choice of the People, it would be evident what complection of Spirit he is of: And is it not a great pity and loſs to the Church, that ſuch a Miniſter as counts and calls the ſerious Praying Folks in his Parish, the dregs of his People, should yet be ſuſpended by a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, and depoſed by a Synod? <hi>Hinc ille Lachrymae.</hi> Finally, if Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> memory had not been wilfully bad, he might eaſily have remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered that theſe of whom he here ſpeaks ſo ſlightingly for their external meanneſs, did yet in his own time and under his view, for the ſpace of three years maintain a Miniſter and a Precenter, by their own voluntary Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality: And therefore they cannot be ſuch a contemptible company, as Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> repreſents them to be.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He ſaith that when <hi>Alexander Calderwood</hi> was charged with invent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and reporting moſt falſe calumnies againſt him, he replyed, <hi>Be they true or falſe,</hi> I <hi>have taken two hundered Perſons from his Communion.</hi> To this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation <hi>Alexander Calderwood</hi> Anſwers, that it is moſt calumnious, and that Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> can never prove it. Nor do I ſee how the foiſting in of this Story among his weak defences, ſerves for any other purpoſe, than to tell the World that Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> is a man that loves to tell an ill Tale (true or falſe) of any that bear the name of Presbyterian, even though it be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to his preſent purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Another thing affirmed by Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> is that he did except againſt <hi>Alexander Calderwood</hi> as a party, and yet he was permitted to ſit in the quality of an Elder, as one of his Judges in the Presbytery; <hi>Anſ.</hi> This is like the reſt of his Calumnies: For, 1. Neither did Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> at his own perſonal compearance, nor afterward in his Declinature, make any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception againſt <hi>Alexander Calderwood</hi>: Though indeed Mr. <hi>Hamiltoun</hi> afterwards did require the Presbytery to remove <hi>Alexander Calderwood.</hi> 2. It is not true that the Presbytery did allow him either to debate or vote in Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> Caſe; though they ſuſtained him indeed as a Ruling Elder to judge in other caſes: And they yet know no Reaſon why he ought to have been removed; and ſo hindered from giving his advice and aſſiſtance in other caſes and cauſes: Had the Presbytery no other cauſe in hand but Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi>? And muſt Mr. <hi>Calderwoods</hi> Legal shewing his diſſatisfaction with Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> Scandalous carriage, render him uncapable of ſitting in the Presbytery. 3. When Mr. <hi>Hamiltoun,</hi> Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> Procurator deſired that <hi>Alexander Calderwood</hi> should be removed, it was refuſed by the Presbytery, not becauſe he was ſuſtained Judge in this caſe, but becauſe (as the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery then expreſly told Mr. <hi>Hamiltoun</hi>) that ſeing Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined them, they could not debate with him <hi>in Cauſa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:54226:14"/>6. Another falshood in Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> narrative, is, that <hi>Alexander Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwood</hi> informed, tampered with, and threatned ſome of the Witneſſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Anſ</hi> It is ſure that before the Presbytery there appeared not the leaſt sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of any ſuch thing. And it may be remarked here, that though before the Synod, Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> ſaid that <hi>Alexander Calderwood</hi> ſuborned the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; yet now in his Printed Paper, he alters and mitigates his Stile (having ſome wit in his anger) and forbears the word <hi>ſuborning,</hi> leſt he should be made to anſwer for it before a Criminal Judge: Therefore he now ſpeaks more ſoftly, though ſtill falſly.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The great Accuſer of the Brethren himſelf could invent nothing more maliciouſly falſe than what he alledges againſt the Presbytery in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the Witneſſes: For greater Candor could ſcarce have been than what was uſed therein. None of the Witneſſes were refuſed or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to ſee or read their Depoſitions: Yea, none were ſuffered to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe their Depoſitions, till they heard them diſtinctly Read, and were aſked again calmly, if they had freedom to ſubſcribe the ſame: None were interrupted, but when through ſimplicity or worſe, they ſpoke beſides the purpoſe: And it was neceſſary to put them to Categorick Anſwers to the Interogatories propoſed, and not to ſuffer them to ſpeak non-ſenſe or impertinencies: and its impoſſible that any Court can either maintain their Authority, or expede their buſineſs, if all who come before them be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to utter what ever they liſt. There was not the leaſt appearance of over-awing any, except by the Oath of God, which they were under; which was eſpecially inculcated when they refuſed to depone and Anſwer, as ſome did: And one of the Witneſſes did, according to the Diſcretion he had, deſire eight days time to adviſe, whether he should ſubſcribe what he had Deponed upon his Oath, or not. So that Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> account of the Examination of the Witneſſes is wholly falſe, and maliciouſly inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> ſayes that there are ſeveral Articles of the Lybel, which are not upon theſe heads to which the Trial of the <hi>Regular Clergy</hi> (as he Irregularly and Popishly Stiles his Prelatick Brethren) is reſtricted by Act of Parliament, and which are in themſelves <hi>alterius fori. Anſ.</hi> This alſo is falſe: For whoſo shall read Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> Lybel, shall not find one Article in it, that is not eaſily reducible, either to Scandal or negligence, and therefore to the heads whereupon the trial of the late Conformiſts is (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Act of Parliament) to proceed: And though ſome of theſe things libelled may be found in ſome reſpects to be <hi>alterius fori,</hi> yet it doth not therefore follow that Eccleſiaſtical Courts may not meddle with theſe things at all. I confeſs, his diſaffectedneſs to their Majeſties Government,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54226:15"/>
deſerves a chaſtiſment from Civil Courts; yet in as much as it vented it ſelf even in the exerciſe of his Miniſterial function, it was the more Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous, and the ground of a Church-cenſure: And it is well known that one and the ſame miſcarriage may be judged both by Civil and Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Courts, and yet both of them keep within their own proper and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ſphere: but Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> will not know the diſtinction of theſe Courts, but fain would confound and embroil all; as appears both by his inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent practice, and by the cloſe of his Information, as we may afterwards ſee.</p>
            <p n="9">9. He complains of an additional Lybel, and that he got no citation to Anſwer to it, nor Copy of it, and exclaimes wickedly againſt the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery for this and their procedure thereupon, and in the bitterneſs of his Spirit dictates to the World his Cenſure of it in theſe Words, <hi>than all which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there can be nothing in Judicial procedures, more partial; pernicious and unjust. Anſ</hi> Herein he shews more ignorance and malice than either wit or honeſty: And if he would be ſober and calmly compoſe himſelf to hear truth and reaſon, I would tell him that he was ſtill under citation to the Presbytery, till he declined them: and after that, to what purpoſe should he have been cited to appear before them whoſe Authority he had ſimply declined. Beſides he may know (if he pleaſe) that there was no Addition made to the Lybel after that Diet of the Presbytery unto which he was cited <hi>apud Acta</hi> by the Moderator in face of the Presbytery: And if he had appeared at that Diet to which he was cited, he had got the Copy of that Additional Lybel (as well as he got of the former) and time alſo to prepare and give in his Anſwers to it: So that he has no reaſon to complain of the want of a Copy of any Addition that then was made: for he would no more bear from, nor meddle with the Presbytery, but declined them before they did any thing in his affair that he could or did complain of; as appears by the Declinature it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="10">10. He ſaith with an admirable either ignorance or impudence, that he appealed from the Presbytery to the General Aſſembly. Doubtleſs the mans own Conſcience cannot but tell him, that there was not the leaſt hint of any ſuch thing. There was indeed a pretended Factory to one Mr. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes Hamiltoun</hi> preſented to the Presbytery (a true Copy whereof is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Printed <hi>ſupra</hi> in the Narrative) which bears a <hi>Declinature</hi> of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries Jurisdiction, but not the leaſt shew of an <hi>Appeal</hi>: So that both malice and weakneſs appear in his <hi>thus making lies his refuge.</hi> In this his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinature he would not ſo much as call them the Presbytery, but in contempt the Miniſters met at <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and diſclaimed their Authority as incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Judges of him (forſooth) yea expreſly denies them to be the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54226:15"/>
of <hi>Dalkeith</hi>: And thus he did ſtubbornly and proudly trample upon both the conſtitution and Government of this Church, and alſo the Civil Authority of King and Parliament eſtablishing it: And for this his Contuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, the Presbytery might well have forthwith depoſed him, and that by Law, and according to their duty; but to evite the shew or appearance and Clamours of Rigidity, they proceeded to the proceſs. It may alſo here be obſerved that in this his declinature, he declines <hi>the Miniſters</hi> he should have added, <hi>and Elders,</hi> if his memory had been good) <hi>as no Presbytery, and that becauſe they could have no Power to Act as a Presbytery till they received it from the General Aſſembly:</hi> Which is ſuch a piece of Non-ſenſe as needs no confutation: For who knows not that Presbyteries are eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by the Law, and General Aſſemblies made up of Delegates from them? Beſides that by this ſort of rare reaſoning, Mr <hi>Heriot</hi> bewrayes both Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and infidelity in the Proteſtant Doctrine about the <hi>Jus Divinum</hi> of Church Government, and the intrinſick power of Miniſters and Elders; as the judicious Reader will eaſiely perceive at the firſt hearing of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And after all this and much more of arrogant, ſtubborn, and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate carriage towards the Presbytery, was it any wonder that the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry declared him contumacious? had they not great and Juſt cauſe ſo to do? Could they do leſs? Nay let the moſt bigot Prelatiſts, upon a ſuppoſition of the Presbyteries Authority, but conſider Mr. <hi>Alexander Heriots</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards them, and if he be a Perſon of any Ingenuity and Candor we might refer this unto his Determination, whether or not the Presbytery had reaſon to declare the ſaid Mr. <hi>Alexander</hi> contumacious? Was he not evidently, and eminently ſuch? And doth he not ſtill continue and shew himſelf more and more ſuch, even to the Superlative degree? Has he not Treated the Synod as Inſolently in his Language as the Presbytery, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from his printed Information? doth he not appear to be a ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Stout hearted Perſon, that is far from righteousneſs? Doth he not utter vain knowledge, and fill his Belly with the Eaſt Wind?</p>
            <p n="11">11. But this vain man proceeds to lye alſo upon the late General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and boldly ſaith, that they found no contumacy in his Appeal. But for <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Doth he not know that there was no ſuch thing as an Appeal of his from the Presbytery to the General Aſſembly, and that his appearing before the Aſſembly was upon the Summonds raiſed at the Inſtance of the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> to which Aſſembly they had referred him? Hath he forgot that he appeared not there to proſecute any appeal (which never was) but to anſwer the Summonds? 2. If there had been any ſuch thing as an appeal of his from the Presbytery to the General Aſſembly, yet it would have been Illegal and Unformal, and alſo unjuſt and unreaſonable, becauſe

Is it not pleaſant here to remember that Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> when before the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly called his Paper (which he ſent in to the Presbytery) his <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinature,</hi> and paſſed from it; yet now in this Information be again and again calls it an <hi>Appeal,</hi> and owns and pleads it as ſuch, in his plea againſt the Presbytery and Synods? How shall we underſtand theſe contradictions? Muſt he, to ſave others the labour of it, give himſelf the lye? It would ſeem that Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> has had ſome more ingenuity before the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, than he has elſewhere and at other times, for that Paper was indeed only a <hi>Declinature,</hi> and he then gave it its true name: neither could he have paſſed from an Appeal (if any ſuch thing had been,) for his ſo doing would have imported his approbation of the Presbyteries procedure in his affair, and even his paſſing from his Declinature imported little leſs. However he should have remembered the known Proverb, that <hi>a Lyer has need of a good Memory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. He injuriouſly and falſly alledges that the Presbytery founded his contumacy upon his Appeal from them: For its referred to his own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, 1. If ever he appeared before the ſaid Presbytery but once? 2. If he offered directly or indirectly to make any Appeal from the Presbytery at his then compearance? 3. If he did not in his Declinature afterwards retract his firſt and only compearance, expreſly denying that it imported any acknowledgment of, or ſubmiſſion unto the Presbyteries Authority and Jurisdiction? 4. If any commiſſionated by him appeared before them (while his Proceſs was in Dependence) except once the fore-mentioned Mr. <hi>James Hamiltoun.</hi> 5.

            <p>But to undeceive the World, be it known that Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Contumacious, was founded, 1. Upon his declining of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and Jurisdiction thereof, plainly affirming them not to be the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> 2. Upon his obſtinat refuſing to compear before the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> and their Aſſiſtants from the adjacent Presbyteries, Authorized by the General Meeting of the Miniſters and Elders of this Church, conform to the Act of Parliament, to try Incumbents: For though he appeared once, yet did he paſs from the ſame in his above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned

Declinature. In both which there was manifeſt contempt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Eccleſiaſtick Government, but alſo of the Civil, Eſtablishing the Eccleſiaſtick; and conſequently a valide ground whereupon to declare him Contumacious. It is true, Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> did (with more cunning ſubtilty then conſciencious ingenuity) before the General Aſſembly paſs from his foreſaid Declinature, (and conſequently from his pretended and falſely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Appeal to the Aſſembly: for he had done nothing elſe that he could call his Appeal: and even this his ſlight ſort of ſeeming repentance contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buts more than he is aware of, to juſtify the Presbyteries having former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared him contumanious: For upon the matter, he hereby, before the General Aſſembly declared himſelf to have been contumacious, and recanted it: though now again he denies his contumacy, and ſo recants his recantation, and Repents of his Repentance; and that even while he is going on in a greater contumacy againſt the Synod.</p>
            <p n="13">13. But let us behold yet more of the impudence of this man: he knows and in part acknowledges that the General Aſſembly referred his Caſe and Cauſe untouched unto the Synod of <hi>Louthian</hi> and <hi>Tweddale</hi>; whereby the ſaid Synod had the Aſſemblies full Power, <hi>quoad hunc effectum</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto them, to cognoſce upon and determine in his Cauſe: yet with abundance of confidence, and contrary to all reaſon and order of Judicato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, this man appeals back again from the laid Synod unto the next Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full General Aſſembly: and this alſo he does, before he did or could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what would be the Synods Judgment of his Proceſs, even as he ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Presbytery with his Declinature: the man is ſo very quick and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighty by the help of a guilty Conſcience. Perhaps he thinks that his qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifying the next Aſſembly with the word <hi>(Lawfull)</hi> gives him a reſerve not to diſcuſs his Appeal before an Aſſembly conſtituted according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Eſtablishment, but framed after his own corrupted judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I shall not eaſily be perſwaded that the man who ſo irregularly and irrationally counter Acts and Rebels againſt the renewed Sentences of the Inferior Judicatories, has any purpoſe to appear and plead ſuch a deſperate Cauſe before the Supreme Judicatory of this Church: yet I deny not, but Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> is a very bold man, and may venture upon great and hard matters, of this kind. I muſt here alſo crave leave to tell him, that by this his Appealing from the Synod, he has tranſgreſſed againſt ſeveral Texts, of his and his Brethrens dearly beloved Canon Law. <hi>ex. gr.</hi> 1. <hi>Se Delegans carius Cauſae Juriſdictionem ſubdelegato mandato mandaverit, in hoc.

            <p n="14">
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:54226:17"/>14 Now let us conſider the Reaſons he gives of this his Irregular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from the Synod. The firſt is that the Petition of the Heretors and People of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> (atteſting his faithfulneſs in the Miniſtry and his inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency as to the things Lybelled againſt him, and craving that the depoſitions of the Witneſſes might be made patent) was not ſuffered to be read in the Synod. <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Synod were Authorized by the General Aſſembly on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to review the Proceſs led againſt Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> before the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith</hi>; and not to enter upon any new Proceſs, or upon Petitions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick to that proceſs: Wherefore alſo when ſome of the Parishoners of <hi>Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keith</hi> offered a new Additional Lybel againſt Mr. <hi>Heriot,</hi> the Synod refuſed to take notice of it; ſo that the Synod gave equal meaſure both to his party and to his oppoſits. 2. It was utterly impertinent for Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> party, inſtead of a Petition, to offer to the Synod an atteſtation of his Innocency; and the Synod acted rationally in ſlighting ſuch inſignificant Teſtimonials; for there is no guilty perſon ſifted before any judge, who could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a company of his own ſtamp to atteſt his honeſty, and petition for him, if that could avail to hinder the Judges cognoſcing upon the Cauſe, and paſſing Sentence upon clear evidence: neither would Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) have uſed this unwarry and ſupitious way of vindicating himſelf, if he had remembred the old <hi>Scots</hi> Proverb about ſuch Caſes 3. Something of an Anſwer to this his firſt Reaſon may eaſily be gathered from what is former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid about ſome mens verbal Teſtimony for Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> and diſowning of his Lybel before the Presbytery. <hi>Supra.</hi> §. Of this Anſwer to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. 4. If this Petition he lays ſo much weight upon, were worth the enquiring after, I ſuppoſe ſufficient evidences would be found of its being firſt drawn up betwixt Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> and his Aſſociats, and then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions gathered through the Town of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and even from ſome perſons very young. 5. The Subſcribers of the pretended Petition could atteſt nothing but according to their own knowledge or Judgement (which in ſome of them at leaſt was not very conſiderable) and if others of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishiners were conſcious of Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> unfaithfulneſs, it were hard for the former to atteſt the Negative. All which make it evident that his firſt Reaſon of Appeal from the Synod hath no weight, nor relevancy in it, but Savours of a bad Cauſe.</p>
            <p n="15">15. His 2<hi>d</hi> Reaſon of Appeal is becauſe when he craved a Copy of the Additional Lybel, and that the Depoſitions of the Witneſſes might be read before him and made patent to him, yet this was refuſed by the Synod: and hereupon he huffs and exclaimes, and tells us by gueſs that this was contrary to Law, and undoubtedly (ſaith this Dictator) for this Reaſon, becauſe the probation was weak, and might not abide the light nor Trial; for <hi>Veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54226:17"/>
non querit angulos.</hi> Anſ. 1. This is an untruth, for the Synod told him that when they entered upon the Cauſe, he would be allowed to hear the whole Proceſs and Depoſitions of the Witneſſes, if he would ſtay: yet he would not ſtay, but withdrew immediatly after he heard his Lybel read. And it is a hard thing for the Synod to read Depoſitions before any man who withdraws deſignedly (as it ſeems Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> did) that he may have a lye to ſpread. For that the Depoſitions of the Witneſſes were read in open Synod, a multitude of Witneſſes can teſtify: if he declined to hear them, who can help that? But from ſome men we may expect any thing except Candor. 2. As for his want of a Copy of the Additional Lybel, he has himſelf only to blame, who by his declining of the Presbytery prevented that: for the Presbytery would not have refuſed him that, nor any other thing reaſonable, if he had pleaded <hi>in Cauſâ</hi> before them: but his deſerting the Cauſe by his Declinature laid no obligation upon the Presbytery to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert and decline themſelves, and court him after his having renounced them: upon which conſiderations the Synod could lay no weight upon his complaint of want of a ſight or Copy of the Addition to his Lybel. 3. As for the Act of Parliament for making depoſitions of Witneſſes patent, which he cites both in this and in the former Reaſon of his Appeal, it is anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 1. That this Act pertains only to Civil Courts. 2. Whatever that Act of Parliament calls for, it muſt be underſtood to be called for, when the Proceſs is firſt led, and not at any time (even after Sentence is paſt) that the accuſed shall pleaſe: otherwiſe there would be a door opened to protract the ſitting of Judicatories as long as any party accuſed shall think fit. Now it is notourly known to Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> and his Freinds, that his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs was not led before the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> by ſtealth, without his knowledge, or in a Corner, but in the Church of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> openly; and where Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> had free acceſs, yea and was ſummoned <hi>apud Acta</hi> to give in his Anſwers to his Lybel, to ſee the Witneſſes, to object againſt them (if he had ought) and to hear their Depoſitions given; and when this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and advantage was obſtinatly refuſed, it is manifeſt that his deſign in deſiring of the Synod to hear the Depoſitions of the Witneſſes, and to have them made patent, was but to gain time, and to fruſtrat the Synods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedure, which uſes not to ſit at any time above one week: and this his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was alſo bewrayed by his wilfull withdrawing from the Synod, after he was allowed to ſtay and hear the Depoſitions of the Witneſſes read: ſo that it appears, he was not willing to hear them. Thus the Depoſitions having been made patent to him (if he had been willing to have heard them) both at the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> and Synod of <hi>Louthian</hi> and <hi>Tweddale</hi>; I ſuppoſe, the Act of Parliament he cites is abundantly ſatisfied, which doth

Beſides, he may know that the Law requireth the Teſtimonies and Depoſitions of Witneſſes to be ſealed up, after Sentence is paſt. 4. As for his Latine which he adds in the cloſe of this reaſon; as it is impertinently alledged, except he reckon both the Presbytery, and the full and open Synod to be but Corners, ſo he might have conſidered that although <hi>Veritas non quaeret angulos</hi> (and it hath not ſought them in this Caſe in hand) yet oftentimes <hi>pelliture in angulos</hi>; and he may know and remember by whom it is, and hath been frequently ſo handled, and this caſe is alſo ſuppoſed <hi>Iſay.</hi> 30.20.</p>
            <p n="16">16. The third Reaſon of his Appeal from the Synod is that he was informed that the only Article proven againſt him, was his Dancing about a Bonfire, <hi>October.</hi> 14. 1688. Which he inſtantly redargued, as a thing that could not be true, becauſe <hi>October.</hi> 14. 1688. Fell upon a Sunday, and all <hi>Dalkeith</hi> knows that they never had any Bonfires upon a Sunday: And yet the Synod had no regard to it, but proceeded to cenſure him: and here again he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults, rails, and cenſures both the Witneſſes as deponing falſly, and the Synod as proceeding againſt him, out of prejudice and deſign, upon what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was alledged, though without probation, or upon redargued proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and with his wonted confidence, adds that this is evidently mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt. But he muſt ſober himſelf and take his Anſwer 1. Whatever come of this Article about his Dancing, yet there are Articles enough of his Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel clearly proven, whereupon the Synod might and did proceed to cenſure him. 2. Even this Article it ſelf was better proven, then he ſeems to be aware of: For 1, There was no miſtake nor diſagreeing of the Witneſſes as to the thing, and matter of fact deponed againſt him, but only as to the circumſtance of the time: which the Synod did duely conſider and weigh: and Lawyers and Canoniſts do tell us, that this circumſtance in is not ſo material, as that a ſmall difference among Witneſſes about it should invalidate their Teſtimony as to matters of Fact. And Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> might have known that Concluſion of Law. <hi>In Scandalo nil refert de die, modo conſtet de crimine &amp; Corpore delicti</hi> Therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo as to the Circumſtance of time (year or day) the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Judged is not ſo material, as to enquire Critically after it, and ſome of the Witneſſes did not advert to it: But by the 14, of <hi>October,</hi> They meant the day of Rejoycing for K <hi>James</hi>'s Birth, which was kept yearly during his Reign upon that day: So that Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> has no reaſon to Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and inſult over the witneſſes, Presbytery and Synod (as he doth) becauſe of a ſmall and eaſie miſtake of ſome of the witneſſes in ſuch a part of the Circumſtance of time. 2. As to the matter of Fact, it was both clearly
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54226:18"/>
deponed by three witneſſes, and many others know it, were they willing to tell the Truth: And it can yet be proven by other Witneſſes, that upon one of their Bone Fire-Dayes, he did with Pipe and Drum Dance about a Bonefire, and Drink a Health upon his Knees. 3. Further to cleare this matter, and to ſtop his mouth as to this, let him know that all the three Witneſſes did, and ſtill do agree even as to the time of this his Dancing, that it was on the firſt of theſe Solemnities that was kept for the Birth of the late K. <hi>James,</hi> after he became King (which we know was <hi>October,</hi> 14 1685) though this Deſignation of the yeare was not enquired, nor required of them, when they firſt deponed; yet they have ſince declared it before many Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, and alſo given it under their hands, though ſome of them did not advert to the year when they were deponing. And this deed of Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> is notour enough through the Town of <hi>Dalkeith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to what he ſaith, that this Article of his Dancing about a Bone-fire was, as he is informed, the only Article of his Lybel that was proven. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. It ſeems his Informers have been Lyars, like his own Printed Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: They ſpeake, and he writes and Prints, Lies, and who can help it? Their Tongues and Pens are their own. <hi>Qui vult decipi, decip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>.</hi> But none of the Presbytery or Synod, not any that are acquainted with the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and Depoſitions of the Witneſſes, have ſaid that this was the only Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of the Lybel proven againſt him. 2. The Synod by reviewing the proceſs found that more Articles than that laſt mentioned were proven againſt him: and the preceeding narrative of the proceſs, and of the depoſitions of the Witneſſes, makes it evident, that there were ſix or ſeven other mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Articles proven againſt him.</p>
            <p n="17">17. We come now to his fourth Reaſon of appealing from the Synod, which has three Branches. The firſt is that he had appealed from the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery; and that they were his Party. <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This is falſe, as has been plainly shewn already: He never appealed from them. 2. If it had been true, what would it be to his purpoſe here, as a Reaſon of his Appeal from the Synod. I <hi>have appealed from the Presbytery: Ergo I muſt Appeal from the Synod too</hi> (and that before the Trial of the Proceſs either in Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Synod it ſeems this is a good Argument in Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> Logicks. 3 If their be any ſeeming ſtrength in this reaſoning of Mr. <hi>Heriots,</hi> I think it moſtly is this, that the Presbytery is my declared party, and have Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced me, and they belong unto, and are a part of the Synod: therefore (ſaith Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> arguing) I muſt Appeal from the Synod alſo. But if this Argument be good, it will oblidge him to Appeal alſo from the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly, becauſe both the Presbytery and Synod do belong unto it,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54226:19"/>
and help to make it up by their delegated Commiſſioners: and who can but ſee the abſurdity of ſuch reaſonings?</p>
            <p>The 2<hi>d</hi> Branch of his 4<hi>th</hi> Reaſon of his Appeal from the Synod, is, that the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> and <hi>Alexander Calderwood</hi> interrupted him, and reaſoned againſt him as Parties, in the face of the Synod, and that even in his preſence, and before he was removed. <hi>Anſ.</hi> He should have ſaid, not the <hi>Presbytery</hi> but <hi>one or two of the Members of the Presbytery</hi> of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> if he had been willing to ſpeak truth: and then how little will this make againſt the Presbytery? And far leſs againſt the Synod; and leaſt of all as a Reaſon of Appeal from the Synod. 2. Was it any wonder that ſome of the Members of that Presbytery ſpoke ſome thing then and there, while he was uttering ſuch things as we have heard and anſwered <hi>ſupra.</hi> Should his lies make men hold their peace? and when he mocketh, shall no man make him ashamed? Ought he not rather to have thanked them for their Friendly freedom in letting him hear ſomething of his own caſe that he was ignorant of, and was of his concernment to know, ſeing they bad then the opportunity of his preſence, which was a great delicate to them, though he their near neighbour. 3. If they be <hi>Parties</hi> as he calls them, why then should they not be heard in the Cauſe as well as he? And that whether he be preſent or not? Had they not Reaſon to vindicate themſelves in his face from the invidious calumnies and manifeſt lies, which he charged them with. Is he ſuch a pillar in the Church that no Member of a Judicatory may ſpeak. in his preſence, but all men muſt give ear, and wait and keep ſilence at his Counſel, and their tongue cleave to the roof of their mouth? I doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the old Gentleman at <hi>Rome</hi> himſelf be ſo arrogant in ſuch Caſes? 4. par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly <hi>Alexander Calderwood</hi> (a Ruling Elder and a Member of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery and Synod) had Reaſon to ſay ſomething for his own Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; becauſe Mr <hi>Heriot</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> according to his wonted modeſty and vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city) branded him in the face of the Synod with ſuborning of Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>The 3<hi>d</hi> Branch of his 4<hi>th</hi> Reaſon of Appeal, is, that notwithſtanding of all that he had ſaid, yet the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> and <hi>Alexander Calderwood,</hi> were not removed, but got leave to ſit ſtill as his Judges, againſt all Law and Juſtice. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. How did Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> know this? By ſome good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former, no doubt, whom he truſted ſo far as to Print the ſtory for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the ignorant World. But how could this (if true) be a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Appeal, which he gave in to the Synod before this alledged crime was committed; although the Copy of the Reaſons of his Appeal was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in after the Trial and Sentence? By what Spirit could he know, when he Appealed, that the Synod would not remove the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith.</hi> Is he not a man of a deep reach and great foreſight? 2. Briefly, this Reaſon
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54226:19"/>
of his Appeal declares Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> to be a man of ſuperabundant confidence, for he poſitively Aſſerts, and that in Print, ſeveral Weeks after that multitudes (and perhaps himſelf) knew it to be a Lie, that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> were not removed, when the Synod proceeded to judge of his Caſe and proceſs: For all the Synod, and a great many moe, do know, that when Mr· <hi>Heriots</hi> proceſs came to be judged and cognoſced upon, not only all the Members of the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> were removed out of the Synod, but alſo the Miniſters who had been delegated from other Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to aſſiſt that of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> were removed: And this, not becauſe they were ſuſpected as partial and Parties againſt Mr. <hi>Heriot,</hi> but becauſe their own deed came to be judged by the Synod. But how Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> could be ignorant of ſo publick and Notour a matter of Fact, wherein he was ſo much concerned, ſeems to have ſome Miſtery in it, not worth the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring after. Sure I am, if his patience and humility had prevailed ſo far as to make him ſtay but a little while after he gave in his Appeal, he would have ſeen the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> removed as well as himſelf: But it ſeems, Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> having in haſte given in his Appeal, he gets quickly away that he may get leaſure to ſeek, find, or make Reaſons for what he had done: And in his ſearch and Conſultation about this matter, he found that the not removing of the Prebytery of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> would be a pretty plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Reaſon for his Appeal from the Synod: And therefore he would needs put it in (whether true or falſe,) among the reſt of his Reaſons: And it had been a pity we had wanted it.</p>
            <p>It may be he, or ſome of his Advocats will object, that though the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> were at laſt removed, yet they were not removed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with him, and as ſoon as he, but had leave to ſit ſtill after he was gone out, and to diſcourſe in the Cauſe. But I Anſwer, 1. Notwithſtanding of this Anſwer and Objection. yet the falshood of Mr. <hi>Heriot's</hi> reaſon remains conſpicuous, for he plainly ſaith, that the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> were not removed, but ſat to judge him. 2. Mr, <hi>Heriot</hi> removed ſooner then he needed or ought to have done; yea when he was deſired to ſtay and hear the proceſs and depoſitions of the Witneſſes Read: And the Presbytery were not bound to follow him cloſe at the Heels, except his ſteps had been better ordered, 3. There was no reaſon why the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> should be removed as ſoon as he. Why should they not be ſuffered to ſpeake for their own Vindication, as well as he for his? Is their Reputation nothing worth in compariſon of his? And why might not their Brethren detain them a little after Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> had removed, to get ſome further Information from them about the matter of Fact; and it was but a very little time they ſtayed after his Removal. 4. Hath not every Judicatory power to examine and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54226:20"/>
queſtion the ſeveral parties contending before them, either together or apart as they ſee Cauſe? And is it not very needful and neceſſary often times, that the parties be queſtioned and heard apart? What need then of this vain Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour about the Presbyteries ſtaying a little behind Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> in the Synod? If he muſt needs dictate Church-Policy, and Law, he has need firſt to learn them better himſelf. 5. Seing Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> in his Paper talks ſo big about Law and Juſtice, and ſo often charges both Presbytery and Synod with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, walking contrary to Law and Reaſon, Unjuſtice, Oppreſſion, and many other hard words, which he heaps up againſt them, upon very weake and falſe pretences; I would fain know of him, what kind and meaſure of Juſtice this is, that he metts out unto the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith?</hi> For in one and the ſame Reaſon of his Appeal, he ſtorms and exclaims againſt them for preſuming to ſpeake in his preſence, and debate in his Affair, while he was before the Synod, and calls it <hi>Interrupting</hi> him; and again in the ſame Reaſon, he Storms and Quarrels with the Synod, for letting them ſit and ſpeake, when he is removed: And if they may not ſpeake for themſelves, neither when he is preſent, nor when he is not preſent, then let him inform them by his next Information, when they shall ſpeak: For till Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> reconcile theſe contradictions. I cannot gueſs at the Seaſon of their ſpeaking, but can gueſs pretty well by the Language of this his fourth Reaſon, what Juſtice they might expect from him, if he were their Judge.</p>
            <p n="18">18. His 5<hi>th</hi> Reaſon of Appeal is that ſeveral members of the Synod did interrupt him while he was Vindicating himſelf <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And here again he makes a great noiſe and Clamour about this, as a thing without example in any Judicatory, and as an open diſcovering of their prejudice, deſign and reſolution to proceed againſt him, although without juſt cauſe: And alledges that when he was craving a ſight of the Additional Lybel, and Depoſitions of the Witneſſes, ſome of them cryed out, that <hi>the ſame should not be granted to him,</hi> as if every one of them had had a deciſive Voice. Anſ. 1. He talks here as if he were reproving a Company of School-Boys, and like and Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Doctor, able to dictate to all the members of Church Judicatories how they should behave in Judgment. But withal he shewes groſs Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Conſtitution of Church Judicatories; for really every mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber has a deciſive voice <hi>protanto</hi> (when it comes to a Vote) and all have equal power both to conſult and determine in the free Courts of Chriſt: And the Deciſion of matters is not referred to a Prelate or his deputy; which yet Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> would like beſt; for he ſpeaks of every members having a deciſive voice, as a great abſurdity: So that by this and other things he shewes that he underſtands very little or nothing of Church-power. 2. As to the few words dropt in his preſence by two of the Members of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54226:20"/>
Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> I have anſwered already. 3. If any other of the Synod preſumed to ſpeak a word while he was ſpeaking, or that any of them cried, or yet ſpake theſe words <hi>It should not be granted to him,</hi> I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, but doubt it much; and I dare not now take it upon Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> Printed word, after ſuch proof of its fallibility, even in matters of Fact and Memory: And though the matter alledged be but ſmall, yet I muſt have another Witneſs (which hitherto I have not found) before I believe it. 4. Giving, but not granting, that ſome one or other Member of the Synod contradicted him, or ſpake ſomething that was not ſmooth and ſoft enough for his tender Ears; then upon this ſuppoſition, I Anſwer. 1. As it is no great Crime, ſo I will not Juſtify it altogether: It may be paſſed as a piece of eaſily pardonable and tolerable precipitancy: And Mr. <hi>Hertot</hi> ought not to have exclaimed againſt it, at an intollerable rate, as if it were a thing without example in any Judicatory, and to make ſuch a Sputter about it as he does. I can tell him where, and when, there were far worſe examples in the moſt eminent of the Prelatick Judicatories, and far greater diſorder and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion amongſt them, notwithſtanding of all the power of the Prelate to keep them in order. 2. However it can be but a very weak Reaſon of Appealing from the Synod, becauſe one or two of its Members ſpake a word not to his minde, while he was there: muſt he therefore Appeal from the whole Synod, becauſe one or two of them ſpake ſomething that did not pleaſe him? Is not this to be a delicate Man indeed? 3. If he had ſpoken and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved as it became a Man in his Coat and Circumſtances, it is like no Man would have ſo far tranſgreſſed the good order and form of Judicatories as to have given him any diſturbance: but when a Man comes before ſuch a Judicatory with a mouth full of Lyes, and utters them with confidence, its a hundered to one, but one or other of ſuch a company of knowing Men, will in a plain and clear Caſe, drop a word before its full ſeaſon. 4. If any contradicted him, the Reaſons by them at that time given for their ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, should have been ſet down by Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> and anſwered, before he had made this a Reaſon of an Appeal from the whole Synod. 5. In short, this Reaſon amounts to this: That he Appealed from the Synod, becauſe while he was before them he got not all the talk and diſcourſe himſelf alone: and thus <hi>videas quantum valere potest.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="19">19. His 6<hi>th</hi> Reaſon of Appeal from the Synod, is becauſe ſeveral Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Synod did ſpeak and deal with him to dimitt, or that otherwiſe they would depoſe him: and hence he confidently, but rashly and cauſeleſly concludes, that the Synod ſaw weakneſs in the grounds they had for depoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him: and here again <hi>pro more ſuo</hi> he exclaims and rails, Anſwer. 1. This, if true, yet is not at all a ground of Appeal from the Synod: for if
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54226:21"/>
any of its Members did without Commiſſion from, or knowledge of, the Synod, give him ſuch a friendly advice, why should he blame the Synod for it, and that ſo highly as to Appeal from them, as not fit nor worthy to judge of his affair? 2. We may here ſee what may be expected from ſuch as Mr. <hi>Heriot,</hi> when men deal freely, friendly and ingenuouſly with them. If Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> having made his application privatly to ſome Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Synod, and ſolicited them for their advice; or, if ſome of them did of their own accord and out of a ſuperfluous exceſs of compaſſion and charity towards him. offer ſuch an advice; it is moſt baſe, unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and unjuſt for him to conſtruct the worſt that malice can deviſe of their freedom with him: if he had judged candidly of their Counſel, he would have concluded that his Dimiſſion was adviſed for his relief from the danger and probable hazard of a Sentence of Depoſition: But <hi>ill Doers are common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ill Deemers.</hi> 3. That theſe Members of the Synod ſaid to Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> that they would depoſe him, if he dimitted not, I utterly deny to be true: for this was more than they could then well know; whatever probable gueſs, fear or foreſight of it, they might vent to Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> in an officious friendly communing with him. 4. Whereas Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> adds for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of this his laſt Reaſon of Appeal, theſe confident and empty words <hi>and there is nothing more certain than that they would never have dealt with him to dimitt, if the probation againſt him had been good.</hi> I anſwer, that there is nothing more uncertain; and if I should ſay, there is nothing more falſe, I would have come nearer the truth, than he has in this point. 5. To prove what he had laſt ſaid, he adds theſe charitable words. <hi>Their malice to the Regular Clergy being ſuch as that they would rather depoſe them for Immoralities and Errours in Doctrine to publish them, than to ſuffer them to dimitt</hi> &amp;c. But for anſwer. 1. It is a malicious Alledgance; and it will be time enough for me or any man elſe to believe it, when he proves it, which I know is impoſſible for him to do. 2. When or where were any of theſe Irregular Men whom he miſcalls <hi>the Regular Clergy</hi>) hindered to dimitt? And who can hinder them to dimitt, if they pleaſe? 3. He hints here that when any of them are depoſed for immoralities and Errours in Doctrine, It is done out of malice, and conſequently not out of Zeal for the Glory of God, and conſcience of that great duty of purging the Church of Chriſt from that great and Soul-deſtroying plague of a corrupt, Scandalous, Worldly, Carnal, Lifeleſs Miniſtry: but there is a day coming when Sinners muſt give an account of ſuch hard Speeches.</p>
            <p>As for what he adds to the ſixth Reaſon of his Appeal (<hi>viz.</hi> atteſting his conſciouſneſs of his own Innocency, his hoping that God will vindicate him, his renewing his proteſtation againſt, and Appeal from the Synod.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54226:21"/>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe things might well have been ſpared, and need no other anſwer than what is ſuggeſted to every mans Conſcience, from the General Rules of Chriſtian Charity. Again in the cloſe of that Section, he makes a clamour about the additional Lybel and Depoſitions of the Witneſſes, and dictates ſeveral things to the Synod about the buſineſs, which he might have ſpared: the Synod know their duty, and need none of his advice, till he grow wiſer: however he needs not fear that the Principal Copies of the Depoſitions of the Witneſſes shall be put out of the way; they will (according to his deſire) be preſerved and not put out of the way, but produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the next General Aſſembly, if need be.</p>
            <p n="20">20. To return to his Information; he complains that <hi>notwithſtanding of the foreſaid Appeals</hi> (he should have ſaid Appeal, for there is but one of them) <hi>the Synod proceeded and depoſed him from his Miniſtry.</hi> Anſ. 1. I ſuppoſe the man may know that an Appeal is not enough to ſiſt and ſtop procedure to a Sentence: otherwiſe Judicatories would never be rid of them, and the moſt notoriouſly guilty would not ſpare to Appeal again and again, if they could thereby gain but a ſmall delay of their Sentence. 2. He might alſo have known that he had no place to appeal from that Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, who were in his cauſe cloathed with the power of the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and Acted as their Delegats, as was formerly ſaid. 3. He is groſly miſtaken in his ſaying, that his Appeal does preſerve his right, and keep all in <hi>Statu quo,</hi> the time of the Appeal, while it be diſcuſt. Indeed, if he had had place to Appeal, and his Appeal had proceeded upon plauſible grounds, it would give him acceſs to another hearing of his Cauſe before the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Judicatory to which he had Appealed; but it doth not in the mean time ſtop all further procedure of the Inferior Judicatory, nor keep all things in reference to him <hi>in statu quo prius,</hi> as he imagines: Eſpecially when the caſe in queſtion is ſufficiently clear; for then the Inferior Judicatories proceed and Act as they will be anſwerable to the Superior: But when the Caſe is Dark, Dubious, and Difficult, it is the wiſdome of the Inferior Judicatory to forbear further procedure after an Appeal. Yet if every Appeal were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſift the further procedure of inferior Judicatories, I am confident that the moſt Scandalous Perſon in all <hi>Scotland,</hi> who bears the name of a Miniſter would not be depoſed except by a General Aſſembly.</p>
            <p n="21">21. He complains that the Eldership of the Parish was invaded, and ſome few (ſeverals of them ſcarce worth to be noticed as Reſidenters) have uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the power of Elcting Elders, and have elected many moe than the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber formerly uſed, purpoſely as they think, to make the greater figure, although but of the moſt inconſiderable of the Paroch; and of deſign to call, impoſe and obtrude a Miniſter upon the reſt againſt their will, contrary to
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:54226:22"/>
the Laws of Charity, practices of Chriſtian Churches, and profeſſion of Presbyterians. Anſwer. 1 How like is this man to him of whom it is ſaid, <hi>As for all his Enemies he puffeth at them</hi>? He ſtill ſpeaks contemptibly of his oppoſites, and of every thing that doth not pleaſe him. <hi>Projicit ampullas &amp; ſeſquipedalta Verba</hi>: and ſeing he doth not keep himſelf <hi>Intra moderamen inculpatae Tutelae,</hi> he muſt blame himſelf if his Antogoniſt anſwer him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times according to his Folly. Why should he here and elſewhere through his Paper, Rant and Exclaime againſt the Presbyterians, as if he were ſtill dancing about the Bonefire: For tho' they have been long and often as the Deaf that heard not, and as the Dumb in whoſe mouth are no reproofs, yet he should not think that it will be alwayes ſo with them, eſpecially when ſuch as he provoke them ſore to retort the bitter verity upon their unwary Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 To come more cloſe to the matter in hand, I ſay as to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged invaſion of the Eldership, that where there is no poſſeſſion there can be no invaſion; and Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> had no Eldership: For the Ruling Elder is a Church-Officer diſowned in the Prelatick Government, which owns no other Officers than theſe, Patriarchs, Primates, Metropolitans, Arch-Bishops, Bishops, Arch-Deans, Deans, Prebends, Rectors, Vicars, Prieſts, Deacons, Curats, Church-Wardens, Sides-Men, Sextons, and the reſt of the Apocriphal Tribe of Mr. <hi>Heriots Regular Clergy,</hi> which he again and again talks of in his Information: And I needed not to have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Pope: for he belongs to the ſame Tribe; and diverſe of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latick Proteſtants do own him as the firſt Bishop, that is to ſay, the Head of the Clan: And for my part I am content that all go together, as birds of the ſame Feather. 3 As to the alledged inconſiderableneſs of theſe El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders choſen by the more regular party in <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> they are nothing infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> nominal Elders, in any thing that is good and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable: And for their number, they exceed not what they were wont to be in times of Reformation. 4. As for their deſign to obtrude a Miniſter upon the Parish, contrary to the profeſſion of Presbyterians. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Anſ. 1· Is it not pleaſant to ſee Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> teaching Presbyterians their own Principles, and pleading for them? Who can but laugh at it, eſpecially if they conſider how ill he has learned either his own or theirs, as we have ſeen <hi>Supra</hi>? 2. The Prelatick principles and practices are in this thing too well know to be ſo ſoon forgotten: And Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> ſeeming to plead for the power of Ruling Elders, and the liberty of the Parish in chooſing and calling a Miniſter, shews him to be no true Prelatiſt, and conſequently neither good Fish nor Flesh. It may be, he will ſay that this was but his <hi>Argumentum ad Hominem</hi>: But then let him take the Anſwer here given both <hi>ad homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem &amp; ad rem</hi>; that his Argument is really <hi>ad neutrum.</hi> 3. It is alſo well
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54226:22"/>
known, that Presbyterians deny no member of the Congregation liberty to object againſt the Intrant, and if their objections bear weight, and be found juſt and relevant, they are regarded; if not, rejected: And if this courſe had been obſerved all alongſt, it may be queſtioned whether Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> would have got entrance there 4. It may very eaſily and rationally be ſuppoſed that the preſent Eldership of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> (with the advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the Presbytery when needed and deſired) may have as good skill of chooſing a fit Miniſter, as Mr, <hi>Heriot</hi> and his Party.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> (not being content with all the inſolent Language and uſage he has given to the Church Judicatories) goes yet farther, and ventures upon an untroden Path that he may rid himſelf of all Church Judicatories; and by a <hi>Salius</hi> quite <hi>extra oleas</hi> betakes himſelf to the Lords of their Majeſties moſt Honourable privy Council, and ſupplicates them (upon the matter) utterly to overthrowthe Government of the Church (and the Laws eſtablishing it) and to take upon them to judge and paſs definitive Sentences in cauſes meerly Eccleſiaſtick: For he and his Party have petitioned their Lordships to diſcharge the calling of a Miniſter, while the Appeal be diſcuſt, and that in the mean time he may be reſtored to the exerciſe of his Miniſtry, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Anſwer. 1. By this trick of Mr. <hi>Heriot's</hi> (if it paſs into an approven example and precedent) he has cut out abundance of new work for the Honourable Lords of Council, I may ſay, for all the dayes of the year, not excepting even theſe dayes which Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> calls Sundayes: But their Lordships are wiſe enough to foreſee what a vaſt deal of their precious time it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, to concert and adjuſt all theſe differences that ariſe through the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome about the ſettling and unſettling of Miniſters: I ſuppoſe, their Lordships would ſoon wearie of it: and truly Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> in his betaking himſelf unto their Lordships, ſeems not to have been ſufficiently ſenſible of the greatneſs of their work otherwiſe: but it is like Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> thinks himſelf and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern ſo conſiderable, that it deſerves time and place amongſt the moſt weighty affairs of the Kingdom; and therefore he puts their Lordships in minde, that he is not only depoſed from his Miniſtry, but <hi>likwiſe from his Benefice, which is his Livelyhood and Maintenance</hi>: and herein <hi>tandem aliquando</hi> he ſpeaks ingenuouſly, and brings forth the great <hi>Gravamen</hi> and quarrel, which has occaſioned all the clamour and noiſe we have heard: Oh, it is the grand loſe of his Benefice, Livleyhood and Maintinence! <hi>Quis taliu fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do, temperet a Lachrymis?</hi> But who lamented the caſe when ſeveral hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reds of a better character, were for ſmaller faults turned out of their Lively<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods? Surely, none of his party. 3. This device of Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> ſeems to aim at, and tend unto nothing leſs (in ſome mens apprehenſion at leaſt)
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54226:23"/>
than the overthrow of the Civil Government it ſelf: for (upon the matter) he ſupplicates the Council to invade the late <hi>Claim of Right,</hi> and bring back again that Supremacy, which the Convention of Eſtates claimed, to be abrogated, as one the grievances of the Nation. And in proſecution of this wicked deſign, he cites an antiquated and abrogated Act of Parliament (of which more anon) and ſuggeſts (falſly and ignorantly) that by the Churches enjoying her wonted and juſt liberties and priviledges, there would <hi>be Regnum in Regno,</hi> and a liberty for the Church to do wrong at her pleaſure without controle. But we may eaſily know whoſe heifer he plougheth with here; this is but a new towt in an old horn; our worthy Anceſtors have ſolidly and learnedly anſwered and anticipated theſe ſuggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: and becauſe their Teſtimony and judgment may perhaps have but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle weight with Mr. <hi>Heriot,</hi> I would minde him of the Judgement and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſome of his more ſound and honeſt Brethren and Fathers, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe ſeven Prelates who were put in the Tower of <hi>London</hi> in the time of the late King <hi>James,</hi> for their Legal adherence unto, and aſſerting of the Churches power and priviledge, and that in a ſtrain far contrary to this of Mr. <hi>Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots:</hi> and it were eaſie to adduce other inſtances of more learned and ſound men of the prelatical way than Mr. <hi>Heriot,</hi> as to this head of Church-power: But I ſuppoſe it is needleſs: neither are the Honourable Lords of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Council ſo eaſily impoſed upon, as to be cheated by ſuch a ſilly Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, as this which Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> here ſuggeſts: for they know that Church-Officers do not deny, nor refuſe, the Allegiance of Subjects, nor does their power reach mens perſons further than what is neceſſary for ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of wickedneſs and Scandal (which Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> and his Advocats ſeem to reckon a doing of wrong without controle) nor does the Eccleſiaſtick power, claimed and exerced by Presbyterians, reach mens properties any way at all. 4, What if there be the hand of ſome <hi>Joab</hi> in this contrivance of diſturbing the Honourable Privy Council with a buſineſs of this nature? What if ſome greater Head-piece than Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> has hood-winked him, and put him upon this deſperate Courſe, and that on purpoſe to do ſome greater miſchief to Church and State, than to protect or relieve Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> from a deſerved Church-Cenſure? There that are wiſer than I, may enquire into this, if they pleaſe. However, when perſons manifeſtly diſaffected to the Civil Government, come to plead for the enlarging and ſtreaching of the limits thereof, ſome of theſe Honourable Governours will be in hazard of remembring the ſaying of the old Trojan Politician <hi>quicquid id eſt, timeo Danaos, &amp; Dona ferentes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="23">23. Amongſt others of Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> falſehoods and calumnies, I ſuppoſe that is one he has in this paragraph I am now anſwering, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:54226:23"/>
of the Presbyterian Miniſters who have ſeen the Lybels and Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, affirm that there is nothing proven but the Dancing about the Bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire: for I am ſure that no rational man, after he has read the Depoſitions, will ſay that there is nothing proven but his Dancing: ſo that theſe Perſons be ſpeaks of, muſt either not have ſeen the Depoſitions, or not have ſaid and ſpoken ſo as he alledges: and I am ſure that both Statſemen, Lawyers, and Miniſters, after ſight of the Proceſs and Depoſitions, have ſaid that the Presbytery might well have depoſed him.</p>
            <p n="24">24. Whereas Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> does again and again make a horrible clamour about making the Depoſitions of the Witneſſes patent and their perſons known, <hi>that they may be inſiſted against.</hi> &amp;c. Here he diſcovers plainly his malicious deſign in demanding ſo often the making patent to him the names and Depoſitions of the Witneſſes, <hi>viz.</hi> Not that he may Anſwer and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate himſelf (though ſometimes he pretends to this impoſſibility) but <hi>that they may be inſisted againſt</hi> and that he may purſue them for telling the Truth: and that even after they have ſworn it, according to the beſt of their knowledge, and conſcience. And let all rational perſons judge if there be any shew of Candor or Honeſty here, in his threatning to purſue the Witneſſes meerly for their declaring (and that upon Oath, when cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to it) what they and others ſaw with their Eyes, and heard with their Ears: does not this ſort of threatning courſe, warrand the Church Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories before whom the Proceſs lyes, to demand of Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> and his party in <hi>Dalkeith,</hi> that they give ſufficient ſecurity to the Magiſtrat, of their good and peacable behaviour towards theſe Witneſſes, before the whole Proceſs can be Printed with ſafety to the Witneſſes: eſpecially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering what violence has been already executed upon, and is yet farher threatned againſt others, by divers of Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi>'s party in <hi>Dalkeith.</hi> Here alſo the Reader may percieve a ſatsfying Reaſon, why in the preceeding short Narrative of the Proceſs, the names of the Witneſſes are not expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. However Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> may remember (for he doth know it) that ſome of theſe Witneſſes have avowed and aſſerted to his face, even that Article of his Dancing about the Bonfire, and other things too; and that even ſince he emitted his threatning and lying Information; and although there were unworthy and indirect means and menaces uſed by his party to daunt the Witneſſes, and drive them from their Teſtimony. To all this may be added, that the Authentick Depoſitions of the Witneſſes were by the Presbytery given in to the General Aſſembly to have been publickly ſeen and read there; as they were afterwards again and again before the Synod; which shews that the Presbytery were no wayes Jealous of their validity and ſufficiency, for probation.</p>
            <p n="25">
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:54226:24"/>25 Toward the end of his Information, he ſupplicats the Lords of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Privy Council, to take notice of this as a further evidence of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of the Sentence; that in the firſt Lybel there are many Articles, which are not Relevant, and yet the Presbytery by their Sentence found the Lybel relevant and proven, which muſt be underſtood (ſaith he) as to the hail Articles of the Lybel complexly, <hi>than which there is nothing more falſe</hi> (theſe laſt words are his, but the Reader may take them as the true Anſwer to what he has ſaid and he aggravates this, as a very great miſcarriage, and boldly alledges that both Presbytery and Synod have Acted contrary to expreſs Law, and have done open, and manifeſt unjuſtice, whereof all that heard of it, are convinced and ſenſible. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Anſ. 1. <hi>Bona Verba.</hi> Theſe things need no confutation, they are ſo evidenty falſe, and ridiculous: What need was there for Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> to proclaim himſelf in Print, to be a Child in Eccleſiaſtical affairs? How does he affront the Honourable Lords of Privy Council by propoſing ſuch Stuff unto them, as this and ſeveral other things in his Petitions? He quarrels and challenges the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery for ſuſtaining the Lybel as Relevant, becauſe (as he ſaith) there are many Articles in it which are not Relevant: this is rare Reaſoning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: Does he not know, that if there had been but one Article in the Lybel Relevant, and other twenty in it not of that weight; yet the Lybel is Relevant notwithſtanding? For theſe other leſſer Articles, do no hurt to the Relevancy of the main Article, and conſequently of the Lybel: and has he forgotten the old Proverb, <hi>Et quae non proſunt ſingula, juncta juvant?</hi> But the Reader may judge of the Relevancy of the Lybel by the preceeding Narrative. 2. As to what he adds that this Acting of the Presbytery and Synod againſt him, is ſuch an open and manifeſt unjuſtice, as that <hi>all that heard of it are convinced and ſenſible of it.</hi> This is ſuch a groſs and manifeſt lie, that I doubt whether he can make a greater, except he have taught his Tongue an extraordinary ſkill in that Art. Is it not time to leave and let him alone, when his rage and impudence is arrived at ſuch a hight.</p>
            <p n="26">26, Yet before I let him go, it will not be amiſs now in the cloſe of this Paper, after having got ſuch a taſte of his skill in Divinity and Church-Government, to conſider his skill in Law and Acts of Parliament, and I trow this Informer will be found no happier in the Law-part of his Paper, than he was in the Eccleſiaſtick part thereof.</p>
            <p n="1">1. He ſayes, It is pretended that the Lords of Privy Council, are not Judges competent to the Sentence of Eccleſiaſtick Courts, and that as they cannot place, ſo they cannot diſplace or depoſe Miniſters. But he An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers that by the firſt Act, 8. Parliament. <hi>Ja.</hi> the 6 It is ſtatute that the King and Council shall be Judges competent to all perſons ſpiritual and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:54226:24"/>
in all matters: and he ſayeth, that to affirm that the Council is not Judge competent to the Sentences of Eccleſiaſtick Courts, is to give theſe Courts an Arbitrary power to do wrong at pleaſure, without remeed or control. <hi>Anſ.</hi> To this it is replyed, that in a matter that hath been ſo much debated, and is now ſo well underſtood it is ſtrange that any man aſſuming to inſtruct others, should ſo much darken counſel without knowledge: For. 1. To make a Court ſoveraign, is not to make a Court Arbitrary: and yet this is the Informers only Argument why no Eccleſiaſtick Court can be Soveraign in the matter of Cenſures, Becauſe then it would be Arbitrary. 2 The higheſt Aſſerters of the Supremacy before the Act of Parliament, 1669 (Which is now reſcinded) did never affirm that the King or Council might by themſelves reverſe or redreſs Cenſures purely Eccleſiaſtick; but the outmoſt by them acclaimed was, and is, that, all remedy by Church Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures failing, the King or Council might with advice of the <hi>ſanior pars</hi> put a ſtop to the procedure for ſome competent time, and recommend a review till better order might be re-eſtablished. But 3<hi>ly.</hi> The Informer might have found the Act of Parliament that he cites, thereafter plainly interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and reſtricted, <hi>viz.</hi> By the firſt Act of Parliament. 12. Ja. 6. Intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Ratification of the Liberty of the true</hi> Kirk, whereby it is expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that the Act cited by the Informer shall no wayes be prejudicial to, nor derogate any thing from the priviledge, that God has given to the ſpititual Office-bearers in the Church, concerning the collation or depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Miniſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this laſt Act the Informer did not, or would not think on: And certainly to underſtand the former Act ſo laxly as he doth, and to apply it to a caſe ſo plain and obvious as Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi>'s Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were no leſs then to overturn the Church, and introduce confuſion,</p>
            <p n="2">2. But in Anſwer to what is ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Council cannot put in Miniſters, and therefore cannot meddle with Sentences depoſing them, the Informer tells us, that though the Council has not the power of Admiſſion and Ordination, yet if a Presbyrery should refuſe without cauſe to admitt and ordain a Miniſter having a lawfull Call, Letters may be direct to charge them to do it; <hi>multo magis</hi> in the caſe of Depoſition is the Council the moſt proper Judge to reſtore, againſt the oppreſſion of an unjuſt Sentence. <hi>Anſ.</hi> But 1. The Informer forgets that the Council Power to charge, in the caſe he ſuppoſes, was allowed to fortify the preſentation of the Patrons, when in uſe, and ſo to maintain that mixed Right, partly Civil and partly Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical, which they pretended to: But now that preſentations are abolished, and that the matter of Calling and of Entering Miniſters is by the late Act of Parliament referred to the Determination of the Presbytery of the bounds, to be by them concluded; the remedy, in caſe of difference upon a Call,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:54226:25"/>
muſt no longer be by Letters of Horning, but by Appeals to the Synod, and from the Synod, to the Aſſembly, to be there ultimatly determined. And 2<hi>ly.</hi> There is, beſides this miſtake in the caſe ſuppoſed, a great diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and inconſequence in the Argument thereon founded: For <hi>Eſto</hi> that the Lords of Council may put the Presbyteries to do their duty, it doth not therefore follow that in caſe they refuſe, the Council may do it for them; which yet muſt be the Informers inference, or otherwiſe he concludes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: But all the Magiſtrate doth in ſuch a caſe, is to bring the matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſome Superior Eccleſiaſtick Court, that may ſupply the fault of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior; which without the Magiſtrate's interpoſing, hath through Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> importunity, been done in this caſe, once and again, much more than was neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But why in the matter of an ordinary Sentence of Depoſition, judged and rejudged by the judicatories of the Church, should the Informer bring things to theſe extremes as if we were in the caſe of ſome great and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant matter, about which the Church it ſelf was divided, and the Magiſtrat oblidged to interpoſe, for preventing ſome ruining prejudice: Certainly, if ſuch clamours be allowed on every occaſion of this kind, the excellent E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtablishment, which we have lately by Law obtained, is of little or no uſe, and both King and People muſt be in perpetual diſquiet. For can the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former upon the ſmalleſt reflection think, that his clamour should preponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with the Magiſtrat to the Sentence of the Presbytery, ratified over and again by the Synod and the Aſſembly, whom God and the Law have intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the final Judgment of ſuch matters: So that were the Sentence even doubtful (as it is not) yet its very Authority should oblidge to an acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence: How much more is the Informer to be blamed, who notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of Mr. <hi>Heriot's</hi> undenyable contumacy and ſeveral groſs Immora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities proven againſt him, whereof almoſt any one is ſufficient for Depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, doth upon ſome ill applyed notions of form and other bold falshoods and calumnies in point of Fact, ofter to make ſuch a ſtirr and noiſe, which yet no wiſe man regards.</p>
            <p>Finally. To what is ſaid, I add a few words more. 1. This <hi>Juridico-Theologaſter</hi> might have remembered (if he had not forgotten his Logicks) that two Powers, as well as other things, may be ſo far diſtinct, as to be neither <hi>Co-ordinata,</hi> nor <hi>Subordinata,</hi> but <hi>Diſparata</hi>: And I take it neither to be Heterodoxical, nor Paradoxical, to ſay ſo of the Civil and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Power; for it hath been aſſerted by no mean men; yea, ſometimes before the Supreme Judicatory of this Kingdom, and that upon the higheſt peril. So that Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> might very well have ſpared his idle and ignorant Story of a <hi>Regnum in Regno.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:54226:25"/>2. Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> by his heterogeneous Appeal has made way for farther ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancy of this kind: For ſome of his ſort I have ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed upon a rare kind of Appealing from the Presbytery to the Synod, Commiſſion of the Church, General Aſſembly, Council of State, and the King, all at once, <hi>ſimul &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel:</hi> and thereby (if this ſort of <hi>ſaltus</hi> come in fashion) do enervate, and render all Judicatories, both Civil and Eccleſiaſtical, in a great meaſure uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and would bring all to the Kings perſonal and immediate determination, when ever any party finds, or but fancies that he is wronged by any Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatory: and what the conſequences of this ridiculous ſort of Appealing would be, ſome men will not have the fear, and cannot have the wit to foreſee.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As to the particular caſe in hand; What ever the Civil power or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy may be, or is, according to Law, I thought it had been reſerved for greater and better uſes and ends, than the sheltering of a Scandalous Curate from the moderate, juſt, Legal and deſerved Cenſure and Sentence of Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories acting according to the eſtablished Laws: and if either Civil or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Judicatories, ſuffer themſelves and their legally ſettled order to be diſturbed, by ſuch groundleſs, bold and falſe clamours and alledgeances as theſe of Mr. <hi>Heriot,</hi> they may be ſure of diſturbance enough for this and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Generations: But they are wiſe enough to foreſee and prevent this and other evils deſigned by the common Adverſaries.</p>

            <p>SInce the preceeding Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> Information was drawn, I have had a ſight of a ſecond Edition of that Paper, which has theſe words in the cloſe added to the former.</p>
            <q>
               <p>And whereas, ſome perſons have: ſtrongly aſſerted to the Lords of their Majeſties Privy Council and others. 1. That Mr <hi>Heriot</hi> was never refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſight of the Lybels and Depoſitions, but that they were given him. 2. That the Presbytery and <hi>Alexander Calderwood</hi> were removed out of the Synod upon Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> Declinator againſt them. It is anſwered 1. That he did many times and with great earneſtneſs crave a ſight of the Lybels and Depoſitions, both in the Aſſembly and Synod; which was refuſed, as a hundred perſons who heard him will witneſs, and none of the Clerks of the Aſſembly, Synod, or Presbytery (in whoſe hands and cuſtody the Lybels and Depoſitions are) will dare to affirm that ever they were given to Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> to ſee. 2. Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> at his firſt appearance before the Synod, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined the Presbytery and <hi>Alexander Calderwood</hi> from being his Judges, they being his parties: and before Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> gave in his Appeal, he was four times removed, while the Synod conſidered the defences he made for himſelf; and none of the Synod can affirm, that the Presbytery and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Calderwood</hi> were removed with him; but at his return after the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Removals, he found them always preſent; and the ſaid <hi>Alexander Calder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi>
                  <pb n="46" facs="tcp:54226:26"/>
and ſeveral others of their number, did in face of the Synod debate againſt him, when he made his Legal defences: Which the Synod having unjuſtly repelled, he thereupon Appealed, and immediatly came away: ſo that there is nothing more certain, than that the Presbytery and <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Calderwood</hi> ſat as his Judges after Declinatour. And it was upon theſe two grounds among the reſt, that Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> Appealed from the Synod; Becauſe they refuſed him a ſight of the Lybel and Depoſitions, which Law allowed him; and that the Presbytery and <hi>Alexander Calderwood</hi> ſat as his Judges, albeit they were his parties, which is certainly true. And albeit after the Appeal, and Mr. <hi>Heriot's</hi> going away, the Presbytery and <hi>Calder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> were removed, at the time of the Vote of Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi> pre-deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined Depoſition, it doth not take away the truth of the Reaſon of the Appeal.</p>
               <p>And whereas beſide the falſe Alledgeance of Dancing about a Bonfire, there is now other Articles ſuggeſted to be proven. Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> makes no Anſwer thereto, becauſe of the uncertainty thereof, hoping that the Lords of their Majeſties Privy Council, will in their Juſtice, and conform to Law, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain the Lybels and Depoſitions of the Witneſſes to be ſeen, and then Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> can openly clear himſelf, from whatever shall appear to be proven againſt him.</p>

            <p>But to this <hi>Crambe</hi> long and often <hi>raecocta,</hi> I reply, 1. In general to the whole of it. 1. This is but a very ſorry Coronis, which here (after long ſtudy) he adds for confirmation or covering of his former lies, which he should rather have retracted, than thus have patched them ſo pitifully: But <hi>Raro vidi Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum poenitentem.</hi> 2. What diſcretion on deference Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> has herein uſed towards the Lords of their Majeſties privy Council, in reprinting with new Additions, a Paper once preſented to their Honourable Board, in an other form, and in tabling ſo many lies before their Lordships, belongs to another enquiry than this, and is <hi>alterius fori</hi> to determine. 3. As he has here ſaid no new thing, ſo the Judicious Reader, will eaſily gather a ſufficient and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying anſwer from what has been formerly ſaid, partly in the Hiſtorical Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the matter of Fact, and partly in the preceeding anſwer to his Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: to which therefore I refer the Reader.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Yet leſt Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> complain that we do not conſider his learned De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences; I shall (for his ſatisfaction) ſpeak a little more particularly in Anſwer to this his ſecond and Additional Information, which is a kind of Additional Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel againſt the Synod and Presbytery.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To his old and again new clamour about his being refuſed a ſight of the Lybels and Depoſitions, I Anſwer, there is more falſehood than truth in this clamorous complaint of his: For 1. He got a Copy of his Lybel hard and faſt in his own hand at his firſt and only compearance before the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of <hi>Dalkeith.</hi> 2. He never yet fought a fight of the ſmall Addition that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:54226:26"/>
was made to his Lybel, nor of the Depoſitions of the Witneſſes; this he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet ſought in time, place, or manner, convenient. 3. There is neither Law nor Reaſon (notwithſtanding of all his Stentorian clamour about it) why he should be indulged a ſight of the Depoſitions of the Witneſſes 1. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had declined the Presbytery as no Judicatory and having no power: for then what had they more adoe with him? Was it not time for them to shake him off as he had shaken them off? 1. After Sentence is paſt, both in the Presbytery and Synod. 3. After he has (even in his Print) threatned the Witneſſes, and ſome of his party have executed violence upon ſome of them. 4. After he was allowed, if he had pleaſed, to hear both the Lybels and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the Witneſſes read before him, by the Synod: but he would not ſtay. 5. Before he give ſufficient ſecurity for his own and his parties good and peaceable behaviour towards the Witneſſes. 6. Before he quit and leave his old Huffing, Hectoring, Threatning, Lying and Railing Stile and Humour, which would have ſpoiled a good cauſe, whatever it may do to his bad one.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to his renewed Clamour about the Presbyteries ſitting ſtill in the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod. 1. He ſaith, that <hi>it is certainly true,</hi> and <hi>there is nothing more certain than that the Presbytery of</hi> Dalkeith <hi>and</hi> Alexander Calderwood <hi>ſat in the Synod as his Judges after his Declinator given in againſt them.</hi> I Anſwer, that notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his redoubled confident aſſertions of it as moſt certain, yet it is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falſe that they ſat there and then, as his Judges: for they had no Vote there in his Caſe, and no judgement paſt upon it while they were there: and they were in due time removed. 2. He objects, that they were his Parties, and were not ſo ſoon removed as he. I Anſwer, becauſe they were his Parties, therefore they ought to have been heard as well as he, and ſo behooved to ſtay a little, after he was gone, eſpecially ſeing he took it not well that any of them offered to drop a word in his preſence, and foolishly calls it an interrupting of him: he thinks that he alone should ſpeak, and none of his oppoſites muſt Anſwer him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before his face nor behind his back; and that then he would win the Cauſe and carry all before him. <hi>Eta</hi>! 3. Whereas he ſaith that <hi>though the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi> and A. <hi>Calderwood were removed at the time of the Vote, yet this takes not away the truth of the reaſon of the Appeal, that they ſat as Judges before the Appeal.</hi> I Anſwer 1. They ſat not as Judges in his affair then and there, and paſſed no Judgement nor deciſive Vote therein, but were in all due time removed. And this takes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way both the truth and the Relevancy of the Reaſon of the Appeal. 2. I ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> would have had better manners than to have ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptibly of his Aged and (for ought I know) his beſt friend, if he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.15. Which text alone (not to mention many others) would have better informed him, who are and who are not to be reſpected, and alſo Who are the true and real <hi>Faces Populi.</hi> 4. That expreſſion, <hi>the Vote of</hi> Mr. <hi>Heriots predetermined Depoſition,</hi> is malicious and falſe, except perhaps he mean, that it was predetermined <hi>in Decreto Divino</hi>; in this ſenſe it is true indeed, yet
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:54226:27"/>
nothing to his purpoſe, and let him take what comfort he can from it, and make his beſt of it: But otherwiſe I would ask him when, where, how and by whom his depoſition was predetermined? I know not how be can make ſense of this loud Lie, except he ſay that the Voting Members of the Synod had before their Vote predetermined in their own minds to depoſe him; for there neither was, nor could be any other humane predetermination before the determining Vote: Now this predetermination was not and could not, be long before their Vote: becauſe Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> does here ſay that the Synod <hi>removed him four times while they were conſidering his Defences</hi>; from whence it follows, both that he was fully heard notwithſtanding of all his clamours about alledged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, and alſo that the Members of the Synod conſidered his defences before they voted: So that the Synods Crime muſt be, that after hearing and conſidering his Defences four times, they did yet notwithſtanding of all this, predetermine in their own minds his Depoſition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they voted it. But this rare Crime <hi>I</hi> may timeouſly enough Apologize for, after that Mr, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot</hi> by his next Information has informed me, how they could poſſibly Vote either his depoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or any thing elſe, before they had determined it, every man in his own mind. Formerly we heard him ſtorming and quarrelling again and again, becauſe ſome of the Members of the Synod and Presytery preſumed to ſpeake in his preſence: and here by this objected, new and unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countabl predetermination, he quarrels the Synod for preſuming to think before they ſpoke when they voted, <hi>Macte</hi>! Is not this a rare Reaſon of appeal? and if it hold, will it not be a ſufficient ground of appeal from all Judicatories in Church or State, and from all Judges who come not in an exact <hi>Aequilibrium</hi> and as a <hi>Tabula raſa,</hi> without either light or affection for the one ſide more than the other, either to cognoſce upon or vote in the cauſe of any Criminals, who come before t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>em? <hi>I</hi> ſee Mr, <hi>Heriot</hi> growes more and more Sublime in his Defenſive Notions: and its like that in his third Apologetick Information he may ſoar quite above all ordinar reach and capacity: and then he may deſerve and get a <hi>Longum Vale.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Other things in this Addition to his Information have been already anticipated, or anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and there is no need of multiplying any moe words about it.</p>
            <p>The candid and ſerious Reader is deſired to excuſe the ſeeming levity of ſome, and tartneſs of other Expreſsions in this Anſwer! For in dealing with ſuch a Huffing and Abſurd Antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt, it is hard to forbear both Anger and Laughter: Yet I have choſen rather to Laugh than Rage and Storm as he doth, although I think he is ſuch a Perſon as with whom if a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nd, whether he Rage or Laugh, there is no reſt: And therefore I have been the leſs curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as to the manner of handling him: ſeing I have little hope that any ſort of humane deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him shall be very ſucceſsful. However let the impartial Reader now judge, whether Mr. <hi>Heriot</hi> had any juſt Cauſe or Occaſion given him to exclaim ſo Wickedly and Horribly againſt the Presbytery of <hi>Dalkeith</hi> and Synod of <hi>Lothian</hi> and <hi>Tweddale,</hi> as he doth all alongſt in his falſe and Virulent Information.</p>
            <p>Finally, this Examination of Mr. <hi>Heriots</hi>'s Paper, is humbly ſubmitted to the Cenſure of the Presbytery and Synod concerned, and more eſpecially to the conſideration of the Members of the next enſuing General Aſſembly: Many of whom may perhaps upon the bare Reading of ſuch an Apologetick Information (though no Anſwer had been annexed to it) get ſuch a Character of the mans Spirit and Temper, as will ſufficiently clear and convince them, that he not only deſerves all that he has met with, but ſomething more.</p>
