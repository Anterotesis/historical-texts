            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Happy those <hi>English Historians</hi> who wrote some <hi>Sixty years since,</hi> before our <hi>Civil Distempers</hi> were born or conceived; at leastwise, before there were <hi>House-burnings</hi> (though some <hi>Heart-burnings</hi>) amongst us: I mean, before <hi>Mens latent Animosities</hi> broke out into <hi>open Hostility</hi>; seeing then there was a generall <hi>right understanding</hi> betwixt all of the Nation.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd Care, if it were possible, not to fall under the Pen of the <hi>Animadvertor</hi>; having several reasons thereof to my self, which now I publickly profess:
<list>
                     <item>1. I knew him a Man of able Parts, and Learning; God sanctifie both to his Glory, and the Churches Good.</item>
                     <item>2. Of an Eager spirit, with him of whom it was said, <hi>Quicquid voluit valde voluit.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. Of a Tart and Smart Style, endevouring to down with all which stood betwixt him and his Opinion.</item>
                     <item>4. Not over Dutiful in his Language to the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> (what then may <hi>Children</hi> expect from him?) if contrary in Judgment to him.</item>
                     <item>Lastly and chiefly, One, the Edge of whose keenness is not taken off by the <hi>Death</hi> of his <hi>Adversary</hi>; witness his writing against the <hi>Archbishops</hi> of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Armagh.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>The Fable tells us that the <hi>Tanner</hi> was the Worst of all Masters to his Cattle, as who would not onely <hi>load</hi> them soundly whilest <hi>living,</hi> but <hi>Tan their Hides</hi> when <hi>dead</hi>; and none could blame one if unwilling to exasperate such a Pen, which, if surviving, would prosecute his Adversary into his Grave. The premises made me, though not servilely fearful, (which I praise God I am not of any Writer) yet generally cautious not to give him any Personal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, knowing that though Both our Pens were Long, the World was Wide enough for them without Crossing each other.</p>
               <p>As I desired, so I partly hoped that my <hi>Church-History</hi> would escape the <hi>Animadvertor</hi>: First, because a Gentleman came to me (sent from him, as I supposed) informing me, That <hi>had not Dr.</hi> Heylin <hi>been visited with blindness, he had been upon my bones before.</hi> Then I desired him to return this Answer; That, <hi>as I was sorry for the Sad Cause, the Doctors Blindness; I was glad of the Ioyful Effect, my owne Quiet.</hi> Nor hearing any more for many moneths after, I conceived my self secure from any wind in that corner.</p>
               <p>It increased my <hi>Confidence,</hi> because I conceived Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> neither out of <hi>Charity</hi> or <hi>Policy,</hi> would write against one who had been his <hi>Fellow-Servant</hi> to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>Sufferer</hi> for, the same <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Master,</hi> King <hi>Charles</hi>; for whose Cause I <hi>lost none</hi> of the <hi>worst Livings,</hi> and <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>best Prebends</hi> in <hi>England</hi>: Onely thus happy I was in my very unhappiness, to <hi>leave</hi> what was <hi>taken away</hi> from the rest of my <hi>Brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a word, seeing no <hi>Birds</hi> or <hi>Beasts of Prey</hi> (except <hi>Sharp-set</hi> indeed) will feed on his own <hi>Kind,</hi> I concluded Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> would not write against me, who conceived my self to be One of his owne Party.</p>
               <p>But it seems I reckoned without my <hi>Host,</hi> and now am call'd to a <hi>Rear-account</hi>; I cannot say with <hi>Iob, The thing that I feared</hi>; but, <hi>The thing that I feared not, is faln upon me.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. III. That after serious Debate the Author found himself Necessitated to make this <hi>Appeal</hi> in his own just Vindication.</head>
               <p>HAving perused the <hi>Books</hi> of the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> against me, it bare a strong Debate within me, whether I should pass it over in <hi>silence,</hi> or return an <hi>Answer</hi> unto him, and <hi>Arguments</hi> on both sides presented themselves unto me.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Silence</hi> seemed best, because I <hi>lacked leisure</hi> solemnly to <hi>confute</hi> his <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versions,</hi> having at this time so much and various Imployment: The <hi>Cow</hi> was well <hi>stocked</hi> with <hi>Milk,</hi> thus praised by the <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Poet</hi>;
<q>
                     <l>Bis venit ad Mulctrum binos alit Ubere faetus.</l>
                     <l>She suckles Two, yet doth not fail</l>
                     <l>Twice a day to come to th' Pail.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>But I justly feared, who <hi>twice</hi> a <hi>Lords-day</hi> do come to the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> (<hi>God</hi> knows my Heart I speak it not to <hi>Ostentation</hi>) that I could not <hi>suckle</hi> my <hi>Parish</hi> and the <hi>Press,</hi> without <hi>Starving</hi> or <hi>Short-feeding</hi> of one: Whereas the <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertor</hi> in his retired Life gives <hi>no other Milk</hi> then following his own private <hi>Studies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, I suggested to my self, that <hi>the second blow makes the Frey,</hi> and should I rejoyn, probably it would engage me in an endless Contest, with which my declining age could ill comport. I remembred the Man who moved in <hi>Chancery</hi> for a <hi>Gelt Order</hi> which should beget no more; but knew not when any such <hi>Eunuch-Answer</hi> should pass betwixt us, to put a period to the Controversie.</p>
               <p>Lastly, our <hi>Saviours counsel</hi> came into my mind, Matth. 5.39. <hi>Resist not evil; but whosoever shall smite thee on the right side, turn to him the other also.</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though some <hi>Divines</hi> make this <hi>Precept</hi> but <hi>Temporary</hi> (as a <hi>Swadling-cloath</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> whiles in the <hi>Infancy</hi> thereof, under <hi>Persecution</hi>;) yet others make it alwaies <hi>Obligatory,</hi> and of perpetual Continuance.</p>
               <p>On the other side, the <hi>Distinction</hi> came seasonably to my <hi>Remembrance,</hi> of a Mans <hi>RIGHTING</hi> and <hi>REVENGING</hi> himself; the latter belongs to <hi>God</hi> alone, <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 12.19.</note> 
                  <hi>Vengeance is mine, I will repay it</hi>; the former <hi>Men</hi> may, and in some cases must do, in their owne fair defence, without <hi>Breach</hi> of our <hi>Saviours Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> lately alledged.</p>
               <p>I called also to Mind, how in our <hi>Common Law, MUTES</hi> at the <hi>Bar,</hi> who would not plead to the Indictment are Adjudged <hi>guilty,</hi> and therefore justly suspected I should from my <hi>Silence</hi> be concluded <hi>Cast in the Court of Religion and Learning,</hi> for such <hi>Faults</hi> and <hi>Errors</hi> as the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> hath charged on me.</p>
               <p>But most of all it moved me, that <hi>Ministers</hi> of <hi>Gods Word</hi> and <hi>Sacraments</hi> ought to Vindicate their Credits, that so they may be the more <hi>Effectual Factors</hi> for <hi>Gods glory</hi> in their <hi>Vocation.</hi> When our <hi>Saviour went about to Heal the Mans withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hand on the Sabbath day,</hi> Mar. 3.4. <hi>Is it lawful</hi> (said he) <hi>to save Life, or to Kill?</hi> Where I observed, that our <hi>Saviour</hi> accounted <hi>not healing</hi> to be <hi>hurting</hi>; yea, <hi>not curing</hi> to be <hi>killing,</hi> in that person who had <hi>Ability</hi> and <hi>Opportunity</hi> to do it. And by the same Proportion, <hi>not plaistering</hi> is <hi>Killing</hi> of ones wounded Credit, and so consequently I should be <hi>FELO DE SE,</hi> and by my <hi>sinful Silence</hi> be the <hi>Wilful murtherer</hi> of my own <hi>Reputation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These last Reasons did preponderate with me; and I resolved on two things; to return a <hi>Plain, Full</hi> and <hi>Speedy Answer</hi>; and to refrain from all Railing, which is a <hi>Sick Wit</hi> (if not the <hi>Sickness of Wit</hi>;) and though perchance I may have something <hi>tart</hi> to Quicken the Appetite of the <hi>Reader,</hi> yet nothing <hi>bitter</hi> against the <hi>Credit</hi> of the <hi>Animadvertor.</hi> This my <hi>Answer</hi> I have here Entituled, <hi>The APPEAL unto the RELIGIOUS, LEARNED and INGENUOUS.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before I close with the <hi>Animadvertor,</hi> Comminùs, <hi>Hand to hand; let us first,</hi> Eminùs, try it at <hi>Distance,</hi> and entertain the <hi>Reader</hi> (to his <hi>Profit</hi> and <hi>Pleasure,</hi> I hope) with my <hi>General Defences,</hi> before I proceed to Answer <hi>each Particular.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. IV. The Author's <hi>first General Answere</hi> taken from his <hi>Title-page</hi> and <hi>Word</hi> ENDEVOVRED.</head>
               <p>MEn may be ranked into <hi>three Forms,</hi> of <hi>INTENDERS, ENDEVOURERS</hi> and <hi>PERFORMERS.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>INTENDERS</hi> are the <hi>first</hi> and <hi>lowest Form,</hi> yet so far favoured by some <hi>Papists,</hi> that they maintain, That a good Intention though embracing ill Means, makes a good Action.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>PERFORMERS</hi> are the <hi>third</hi> and <hi>highest rank,</hi> to which my Thoughts dare not aspire, but leave this <hi>upper room empty,</hi> to be <hi>filled</hi> by Men of better <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>ability.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>middle Form</hi> consists of <hi>ENDEVOURERS,</hi> amongst whom I took my <hi>station</hi> in the <hi>Title-page</hi> of my <hi>Book, The Church-History of Britain, ENDEVOURED by Thomas Fuller.</hi> And as I did not <hi>hope</hi> that any <hi>Courteous Reader would call</hi> me up <hi>higher,</hi> so I did not <hi>fear</hi> that any <hi>Caviller</hi> thereat <hi>could cast</hi> me <hi>lower,</hi> but that I might still peaceably possess my Place of an <hi>ENDEVOURER.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, what though I fall short of that which I desire, and strive to perform, I did neither belie my self, nor deceive the Reader, who neither was the <hi>first,</hi> nor shall be the <hi>last,</hi> of whom it may be truly said, <hi>Magnis excidit Ausis.</hi> The <hi>Fate</hi> of many, my <hi>Betters,</hi> who have undertook to compass high and hard Matters.</p>
               <p>But it may be <hi>objected</hi> against me, that being <hi>conscious</hi> of my owne <hi>weakness</hi> with the <hi>weight</hi> of the <hi>burden,</hi> I should have left the <hi>Work</hi> for some <hi>stronger</hi> back to <hi>bear,</hi> and quitted it to those who would not only have <hi>endevoured</hi> but <hi>performed</hi> the same.</p>
               <p>I <hi>answer</hi>; first, I did <hi>hope,</hi> that what was <hi>acceptable</hi> to <hi>God,</hi> would not be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible</hi> to <hi>good Men</hi>; having read, <hi>If there be first a willing mind, it is accepted according to that</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 8.12.</note> 
                  <hi>a man hath, and not according to that he hath not.</hi> Secondly, seeing this my <hi>willingness</hi> was attended with a <hi>competencie</hi> of <hi>Books, Records, Friends, Intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, Strength, Health</hi> and <hi>Leisure,</hi> (be all spoken <hi>not</hi> to my <hi>praise,</hi> but <hi>Gods glory</hi>) I did hope something worth the <hi>Readers acceptance</hi> might be produced. Lastly, though failing in what I undertook, I hoped to perform what might be usefull and advantagious to <hi>abler Pens</hi> undertaking the same task, and to use my owne (as who should forbid) Expression, my <hi>Beams,</hi> might be <hi>Scaffolds</hi>; my <hi>Corner, Filling stones</hi> for his more <hi>beautiful Building.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>premisses</hi> encouraged me to undertake my <hi>Church-History</hi>; wherein, if I have not done what the <hi>Reader expected,</hi> let him consider with himself, whether he did not <hi>expect</hi> what I never <hi>promised.</hi> Who being unwilling to be Cast by the <hi>Verdict</hi> of the <hi>Ingenuous,</hi> for <hi>laying my owne Action too high,</hi> have not <hi>farced</hi> the first <hi>page</hi> of my <hi>Book,</hi> like a <hi>Mountebanks Bill,</hi> pretending no higher but to <hi>ENDEVOUR.</hi>

               <p>IT is the <hi>Advantage</hi> of a <hi>Small Book,</hi> that the <hi>Authors Eye</hi> may in a manner be <hi>Incumbent</hi> at once over it all, from the Beginning to the End thereof; a Cause why they may be more exactly corrected.

               <p>THe <hi>first Edition</hi> of a Book, in a difficult Subject, hath ever been beheld as less complete; and a liberty of Correcting and Amending hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to all <hi>Authors</hi> of this kind.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:61668:6"/>Next, we will insist in another <hi>Author above all exception,</hi> even the <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> himself, who in his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Reader,</hi> before the <hi>Second</hi> and much altered <hi>Edition</hi> of his <hi>MICROCOSME,</hi> thus expresseth himself, not unhappily either for his owne or my purpose:
<q>I am not the first of whom it was said, <hi>Secundae Cogitationes sunt meliores;</hi> neither is it a thing rare for Children of this nature, to be as often perfected as born; Books have an <hi>Immortality</hi> above their <hi>Authors.</hi> They when they are full of <hi>Age</hi> and <hi>Guiltiness,</hi> can be retaken into the wombe which bred them, and with a new Life, receive a greater Portion of Youth and Glory. Every Impression is to them another being; and that alwayes may, and often doth bring with it, a sweeter Edition of Strength and Loveliness. Thus with them Age, and each several Death, is but an Usher to a new Birth; each several Birth the mother of a more vigorous Perfection.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Had the like liberty of a <hi>Second Edition</hi> been allowed me, which the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> assumed, his pains had been prevented, and most of the Faults he hath found in my Book (being either derected by my self, or discovered by my Friends, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating the same unto me) had been rectified.</p>
               <p>Thus in the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue the same word <hi>SECUNDUS</hi> signifieth both <hi>Second</hi> and <hi>Successful,</hi> because Second Undertakings (wherein the failings of the former are observed and amended) generally prove most Prosperous.</p>
               <p>But it will be <hi>Objected,</hi> Such <hi>Second Editions</hi> with new <hi>Insertions, Additions</hi> and <hi>Alterations,</hi> are no better than <hi>Pick-pockets</hi> to the <hi>Reader,</hi> who having <hi>purchased</hi> and <hi>perused</hi> the <hi>first Edition,</hi> is by this <hi>new one,</hi> both in his <hi>purse</hi> and <hi>pains</hi> equally abused, and his Book rendred little better than <hi>Waste paper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I <hi>Answer</hi>; First, I am no more obnoxious to this Objection than other <hi>Authors</hi> who set fort New Editions. Secondly, I hope my Alterations shall not be so many or great as to disguise the second from the first Edition; Lastly, I will take order (God willing) for the Printing of a peice of Paper (lesse then a Leaf) in my second Impression, being the <hi>Index of Alteration,</hi> so that the Owners of the <hi>First,</hi> may (if so pleased) in less then an Hour, with their Pens, conform their Books to the new Edition, which though a little less Beautifull to the Eye, will be no less Beneficial to the Users thereof.</p>
               <p>Here let me humbly tender to the Readers Consideration, that my <hi>HOLY WARRE,</hi> though (for some Design of the Stationer) sticking still in the Title Page, at the <hi>third Edition</hi> (as some <hi>unmarried Maids</hi> will never be more then <hi>eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen</hi>) yet hath it <hi>oftner</hi> passed the Press, as hath my <hi>HOLY STATE, MEDITA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS,</hi> &amp;c. and yet never did I alter <hi>Line</hi> or <hi>Word</hi> in any new <hi>Impression.</hi>

               <p>I speak not this by way of <hi>Attribution</hi> to my Self, as if my Books came for that first with more Perfection then other Mens, but with <hi>Insinuation</hi> to the Reader, that ti is but equall that I, who have been no <hi>Common Begger</hi> in this Kind, yea never before made use of a <hi>second Edition,</hi> may now have the Benefit thereof allowed me, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in a Subject of such <hi>Length, Latitude, Difficulty, Variety</hi> and <hi>Multiplicity</hi> of Matter.</p>

               <p>THe Knowledge of our Saviour, <hi>as God,</hi> may be compared to the <hi>Sun,</hi> all perfect and compleat at once without any accession or addition thereunto, whilst his Knowledge, <hi>as Man,</hi> like the <hi>Waxing Moon</hi> was capable of <hi>Increase,</hi> and was (though not subject to the least Error) receptive of clearer <hi>Information</hi>; <note n="*" place="margin">Luke 2.28.</note> and <hi>Iesus increased in Wisdome</hi>; yea, it is expresly said, <hi>yet learned he Obedience by the thing which he suffered.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61668:6"/>Not such, the Knowledge of the best and wisest Man, which besides a Capability of more Instruction, is always attended with an obnoxiousnesse to many mistakes, seeing <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 13.9.</note>
                  <hi>here wee know in part,</hi> and easy it is for any Man to come on the <hi>Blinde Side</hi> of another, as being better versed and skilled in such particular matters.</p>
               <p>When therefore I find my self convinced in my Judgement of an Error in my <hi>Church-History,</hi> by perusing the Notes of the <hi>Animadvertor,</hi> I will fairly and freely confesse and amend it.</p>
               <p>And I conceive it is no shame at all for a <hi>Childe</hi> to write a few Lines of <hi>Retractation,</hi> after so good a <note n="*" place="margin">St <hi>Augustin.</hi>

               <p>In such a case let not the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> give me any <hi>Blowes,</hi> where I conceive that my <hi>own Blush</hi> is a sufficient <hi>Penance</hi> for the same; and let him not immoderately insult on such occasions, seeing my <hi>Iudgement-Faults</hi> will be found neither in number nor Nature such as He hath suggested.

               </p>
               <p>Besides, the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> is concerned to be civill to me in this Kind, seeing in this particular.</p>

                  <l>Veniam petimus dabimusque vicissim:</l>

               <p>If I were minded to <hi>retaliate,</hi> and to show that <hi>Humanum est errare,</hi> I could instance in many mistakes in the last Edition of his <hi>Geography.</hi> Some of the best Birth and Brains in our Nation, and Travalers in foreign parts, as far as <hi>India</hi> it self, proferred me on their accord to detect in several Countryes unexcusable Errors, confuted by their ocular discovery.</p>
               <p>I heartily thanked them for that which I refused to accept; and did return; First, that the Book had atchieved a generall Repute, and not undeservedly. Secondly, that it was very usefull, and I my Self had reaped Benefit thereby. Thirdly, that it would seem in me <hi>like to Revenge</hi> in this Juncture of Time, when the Doctor was disadvantaged by some Infirmity. Lastly, that others might be detremented thereby. Yea, if we but look into his <hi>SHORT VIEW of the Life and Reign of</hi> King <hi>CHARLES,</hi> some Faults occur therein which God willing I will calmly discover in our Answer to these Animadversions, not with intent to <hi>Cloud</hi> his <hi>Credit,</hi> but <hi>Clear</hi> my own.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX. The Sixth General Answer. That <hi>Prelial Mistakes</hi> in Defiance of all Care will escape in the best Corrected Book.</head>
               <p>THe most accurate Book, that ever came forth into Light, had some <hi>Mistakes</hi> of the <hi>Presse</hi> therein. Indeed, I have heard of <hi>Robert Stephen,</hi> that he offered a great <hi>Summe</hi> of <hi>Money</hi> (equivalent perchance to <hi>five Pounds</hi> of our <hi>English Coin</hi>) to such who would discover any <hi>Erratum</hi> in his <hi>Folio Greek Testament,</hi> dedicated to <hi>King Francis</hi> the <hi>first.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:61668:7"/>But sure I am, that some of our <hi>English Bibles,</hi> which may be presumed set forth with the best Care, <hi>printed</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> have their <hi>Errats</hi>; and therefore <hi>Prelial Faults</hi> being a <hi>catching Disease,</hi> no wonder if my Book as <hi>well</hi> (or rather as <hi>ill</hi>) as others, be subject to the same.</p>
               <p>Here it will be <hi>objected</hi> that there is a <hi>known</hi> and <hi>sure Receipt</hi> for the <hi>Cure</hi> of this <hi>Disease, viz.</hi> the <hi>Listing</hi> of such <hi>Faults</hi> as have <hi>escaped,</hi> either in the <hi>Beginning</hi> or <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Book</hi>; that so the <hi>Reader</hi> may, if he please, <hi>amend,</hi> if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, <hi>avoid</hi> them. Such an <hi>Index Erratorum,</hi> or <hi>Catalogue</hi> of <hi>Mistakes,</hi> is, in some sort a <hi>STOOL OF REPENTANCE,</hi> wherein <hi>Offenders find</hi> their <hi>lost Innocence</hi>; and such faults thus confessed, are never charged either on the <hi>Author's</hi> or <hi>Printer's</hi> Account.</p>
               <p>It is answered, that although such a List of Faults, generally followeth as the <hi>Impedimentum</hi> or <hi>Baggage</hi> in the Rere of a Book, yet seldome or never is it adequate to all the <hi>Errata's,</hi> which are committed therein.</p>
               <p>For first, all <hi>committed,</hi> are not <hi>discovered,</hi> neither by the <hi>Corrector,</hi> nor the <hi>Author</hi> himself, who perusing his own Book, in <hi>overlooking</hi> the faults therein, <hi>Overlooks</hi> them indeed, and following the conduct of his own fancy, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in He intended all to be right) readeth the words in his Book, rather as they <hi>should be,</hi> than as <hi>they are</hi> printed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, all faults which are <hi>discovered</hi> are not <hi>confessed.</hi> Such as the Printer esteemeth small, He leaveth to be amended by the <hi>direction</hi> of the <hi>Sense,</hi> and <hi>discretion</hi> of the <hi>Reader</hi>; according to the common Speech, that the <hi>Reader ought to be better than his Book.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In my Book, the <hi>Index</hi> of <hi>Errata's</hi> amounts not to above <hi>forty,</hi> a very small number in proportion of so voluminous a Work, which <hi>with Credit</hi> might crave the <hi>allowance</hi> of twice as many more thereunto: The Animadvertor in these his <hi>Notes,</hi> maketh great advantage of some of these <hi>un-confessed-Faults,</hi> and I sometimes plead the mistake of the Press for my Answer, though seldome, save when some <hi>similitude of form</hi> in the mistaken letter rendreth it probable for a <hi>Prelial Error.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>HIstorians,</hi> who write of things done at <hi>distance,</hi> many <hi>miles</hi> from their <hi>dwellings,</hi> and more <hi>years</hi> before their <hi>Births,</hi> must either feign them in their owne <hi>Brains,</hi> or fetch them from other credible Authors. I say <hi>credible,</hi> such as carry <hi>worth</hi> and weight with them, Substantial Persons, <hi>Subsidie men</hi> (as I may say) in <hi>Truths</hi> Book; otherwise, for some Pamphlets, and all <hi>Pasquils,</hi> I behold them as so many <hi>Knights of the Post,</hi> even of no Reputation.</p>
               <p>Now, for the more credit of what is written, and better assurance of the Reader, it is very expedient that the Author alledged be fully and fairly quoted in the <hi>Margin,</hi> with the <hi>Tome, Book; Chapter, Leaf, Page</hi> and <hi>Columne,</hi> sometimes (seldome descending so low as the <hi>Line</hi>) where the thing <hi>quoted</hi> is expressed; and this done, the <hi>Author</hi> is free from fault which <hi>citeth it,</hi> though He may be faulty who is cited, if delivering a falshood.</p>
               <p>Indeed, if one become bound as <hi>Surety</hi> for another, he engageth Himself to make good the <hi>Debt</hi> in the Default of <hi>Principal.</hi> But if he onely be <hi>Bail</hi> for his <hi>Appearance,</hi> and accordingly produceth his Person in <hi>Publick Court,</hi> He ought to be discharged without farther trouble.</p>
               <p>Semblably, if one not onely <hi>cites,</hi> but <hi>commends</hi> the words of an Authour,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61668:7"/>
then He <hi>undertakes</hi> for him, <hi>adopts</hi> his words to be his <hi>owne,</hi> becomes his <hi>Pledge,</hi> and consequently is bound to justifie and maintain the truth of what he hath quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But if he <hi>barely</hi> alledgeth his words, without any <hi>closing</hi> with them in his Judgement, he is onely bound for that <hi>Author's appearance.</hi> Understand me, to justifie that such words are exactly extant in <hi>manner</hi> and <hi>form</hi> in the place alledged, easy to be found by any who will follow the <hi>Marginal direction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I reserve for my <hi>Eighth</hi> and <hi>last Answer,</hi> when taxed by the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> for such things for which I have presented my <hi>Author</hi> in the <hi>Margin.</hi> In such cases I conceive I should be discharged; and, if any <hi>Fees</hi> at all be to be paid, I hope the <hi>Courteous Reader</hi> (on my request) will <hi>remit</hi> them, and <hi>dismiss</hi> me, without more molestation.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XI. That many of the Animadvertors Notes are onely <hi>Additional,</hi> not <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite</hi> to what I have written; And that all things, omitted in an History, are not Defects.</head>
               <p>WHo so beholdeth the Several places in my Book, noted on by the <hi>Animadvertor,</hi> hath cause, at the first Blush, to conclude my <hi>Church-History</hi> very <hi>Erroneous</hi> and <hi>full</hi> of <hi>Faults</hi>; out of which, so <hi>bigg a Bundle</hi> of <hi>Mistakes</hi> have been collected: but upon serious Perusal of these Notes, it will appear that a <hi>third part</hi> of them at the least, are meerly <hi>Additional</hi> not <hi>opposite</hi> to what I have written; so that they render my <hi>Book</hi> not for <hi>Truth</hi> the <hi>lesse,</hi> but his for <hi>Bulk</hi> the <hi>greater.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Herein he seemeth like unto those <hi>Builders</hi>; who either wanting <hi>Materials</hi> to erect an <hi>intire house,</hi> or fearing so <hi>frail</hi> and <hi>feeble</hi> a <hi>Fabrick</hi> will not stand by it self, run it along the side-walls of another house, whereby they not onely save <hi>Timber,</hi> but gain strength to their <hi>New Edifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Animadvertor</hi> had a Mind to communicate some new <hi>Notions</hi> he had to the <hi>World,</hi> but he found them not <hi>many</hi> and <hi>weighty enough</hi> to fill a just <hi>Book</hi> for <hi>Sale</hi>: whereupon, he resolves to <hi>range</hi> his <hi>Notions</hi> against my <hi>Church-History,</hi> that so partly <hi>carping thereat,</hi> and partly <hi>adding thereto,</hi> he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt both make up a <hi>Book</hi> Competent for <hi>Sale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence, it is that sometimes not liking my <hi>Language</hi> (as not <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>expressive</hi> enough) he substituted his <hi>owne,</hi> with <hi>little</hi> or <hi>no variation</hi> of <hi>Matter</hi>; and <hi>some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi> adds new Passages: some whereof I could formerly have inserted, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I perceived my <hi>Book</hi> (as the <hi>Reader</hi> is sensible by the <hi>price</hi> thereof) grown already to too great a <hi>Volume.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When <hi>Additional Notes</hi> frequently occur, I conceive my self not obliged in the least degree to return an Answer thereunto, as being rather <hi>besides</hi> than <hi>against</hi> what I have written: However, if I have left out any thing, it would have been suspected I had omitted that which most had made against me, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent which Jealousie, such <hi>Additional Notes</hi> are also here <hi>verbatim</hi> represented.</p>
               <p>To such as object that the <hi>Animadvertor's Additions</hi> are <hi>Suppletory</hi> of the <hi>Defects</hi> in my <hi>Church-History</hi>; I answer, that a <hi>Defect</hi> properly is <hi>Absentia debiti adesse,</hi> the <hi>Absence of what ought to be there,</hi> so that a thing is <hi>maimed</hi> or <hi>lame</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
               <p>But Additions to an History are reducible to these two Heads, <hi>viz.</hi> either such as they
<q>
                     <l>Must <hi>without</hi> Imperfection be added.</l>
                     <l>May <hi>without</hi> Impertinency be added.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Few,</hi> if any, of the former; some of the latter kind are found in the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertor's <hi>Additory</hi> Notes. And let me tell Him, that if He <hi>writes Books</hi> against
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61668:8"/>
all who have <hi>written Books,</hi> and have not <hi>written all</hi> which may be said of <hi>their Subject,</hi> he may even <hi>write</hi> against all who have ever <hi>written Books,</hi> and then He will have <hi>work enough.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us go no farther then to his own <hi>Geophraphy,</hi> being sure he is too <hi>Iudicious</hi> to be so conceited of his own pains, as to think he hath inserted all that may be said of so large a Subject.</p>

                  <hi>Story</hi> is well known of <hi>Aesop</hi>'s Master, who buying two Servants toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the <hi>Market-place,</hi> demanded of one of them, what <hi>he could doe</hi>; He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, that he <hi>would doe all things, doe all things.</hi> Then the other [<hi>Aesop</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self] being askt what <hi>he could doe,</hi> answered, He <hi>could doe nothing.</hi> His Master seeming angry to keep so <hi>unprofitable a Servant; How can I</hi> (returned <hi>Aesop</hi>) <hi>doe any thing, when my Fellow-servant will doe all, and leave me nothing to doe?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> hath done <hi>all things</hi> in his <hi>Geography,</hi> he hath given a <hi>Writ of Ease</hi> for ever to Posterity, who may Despair to merit more of that matter.

               <p>I presume not to say, that I have in my <hi>Church-History</hi> done <hi>all things,</hi> having written many and most material Passages, leaving the rest to others. But this I say, that <hi>all things</hi> left out in a History, are not <hi>wanting</hi>; neither are <hi>all things wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, Defects,</hi> if not <hi>essential</hi> thereunto.

               <head>CHAP. XIII. What <hi>Good</hi> the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> might, but would not doe; and, what <hi>Good,</hi> by Gods goodness he Herein hath done unto the <hi>Author.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>WHen the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> had perused my <hi>Book,</hi> marking some (but making moe) faults therein, it was in his Power to have done me a Pleasure, the greatest he could give, or I receive, <hi>viz.</hi> not to <hi>paradigmatize</hi> me, but by Letter in an amicable way to impart my Mistakes unto me, that I might amend them in my next <hi>Edition.</hi> Say not, He owed me no such thing, who would have beheld it not as a <hi>Debt</hi> paid unto, but <hi>Alms</hi> bestowed upon me.</p>
               <p>I was not wholly without hope hereof, having found such favour from some worthy Friends. Had the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> done the like, How had he obliged me? As the Society of <hi>Peter-house</hi> do preserve the Pictures of their Benefactors in their Parlour, so would I have erected unto him a Monument of Gratitude in my Heart, besides my publick acknowledgement of the courtesie.</p>
               <p>But it seems He intended not my Information, but Defamation. However, he hath done to me a great good turn, for which (because not intended) I will thank <hi>God, viz.</hi> He by his causeless Carping hath allayed in me the delight in Writing of <hi>Histories</hi>; seeing nothing can be so unpartially and inoffensively written, but some will carp thereat.</p>
               <p>Mothers minding to wean their Children, use to put Soot, Wormwood or Mustard on the Nibbles of their Breasts. God foresaw I might Suck to a Surfet in Writing <hi>Histories,</hi> which hath been a Thief in the Lamp of my Life, wasting much Oyle thereof. My Head and Hand had robb'd my Heart in such delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Studdies. Wherefore he raised the bitter Pen of the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> to wean me from such Digressions from my Vocation.</p>
               <p>I now experimentally find the Truth of * <hi>Solomon</hi>'s words, <hi>of making many Books there is no End.</hi> Not, but that all <hi>perfect Books</hi> (I mean <hi>perfect</hi> in <hi>sheets,</hi> otherwise none save Scripture <hi>perfect</hi>) have <hi>Finis</hi> in the Close thereof; or that any Author is so irrational, but He propounds an End to himself before he begins it; but that in <hi>making of many Books there is no end</hi>; that is, the Writers of them seldome or never do attain that End which they propound to themselves, especially if Squinting at sinister Ends, as who is not <hi>flesh</hi> and <hi>blood?</hi> Such as project wealth to themselves, are commonly by unwise managing, or casual miscarriage, impaired
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61668:9"/>
thereby in their Estates. Others who designed to themselves, (with the <hi>builders</hi> of <hi>Babel</hi>) to <hi>get them a Name,</hi> commonly meet with shame and disgrace. Or else, when their Books <hi>are ended,</hi> yet they are <hi>not ended,</hi> because though never so cautiously written, some Antagonists will take up the Bucklers against them, so that they must <hi>begin</hi> again after they have <hi>ended,</hi> (or sink in their credits) to write in their own vindication, which is my case, enough to take <hi>off my edge,</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <hi>too keen</hi> in making multiplicity of Books.</p>
               <p>I confess, I have yet one <hi>History</hi> ready for the Press, which I hope will be for Gods Glory and Honour of our Nation. This new-built Ship is now on the <hi>Stocks,</hi> ready to be lanched; and being a Vessel of <hi>great Burden,</hi> God send me some good Adventurers to bear part of the Expence. This done, I will never meddle more with making any Books of this Nature. It is a provident way, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Writing leave us,</hi> to <hi>leave of Writing</hi>; and the rather, because <hi>Scribling</hi> is the <hi>Frequentative</hi> thereof.</p>
               <p>If therefore my <hi>Petitioning</hi> and <hi>Optative</hi> Amen, shall meet with Gods <hi>Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioning</hi> and <hi>Imperative</hi> Amen, I will hereafter totally attend the Concernments of my Calling, and what directly and immediately shall tend to the advance of Devotion in my Self and in Others, as preparatory to my Dissolution out of this state of Mortality.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XIV. That the <hi>Author</hi> is unjustly charged by the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> for being <hi>agreeable to the Times;</hi> And how far forth such <hi>Agreeableness</hi> is consistent with <hi>Christian Prudence.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Page. 268. towards the bottom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of</note>THe <hi>Animadvertor</hi> is pleased to Charge me to be a great <hi>Temporizer,</hi> and <hi>agreeable to the Times.</hi> In Order to my Defence herein, let me premise this <hi>Distinction</hi>; that there is a <hi>Sinful</hi> and <hi>Sinless Agreeableness with the Times,</hi> be they never so bad.</p>
               <p>It is a <hi>Sinful Agreeableness,</hi> when People for their private <hi>profit,</hi> or <hi>safety,</hi> or both, are resolved in <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Life; Faith,</hi> and <hi>Fact; Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Manners,</hi> to be the same with the <hi>Times</hi>; how contrary soever they be unto the <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> Be it <hi>BIBLE,</hi> or <hi>THALMUD,</hi> or <hi>ALCORAN,</hi> or <hi>MASSE-BOOK,</hi> or <hi>COMMON-PRAYER-BOOK,</hi> or <hi>DIRECTORY; any, many, all,</hi> or <hi>no Manner</hi> of <hi>God's publick Service</hi>; to them, all is alike, and equally imbraced.</p>
               <p>But there is also a <hi>Sinless,</hi> yea lawful and necessary <hi>agreeableness</hi> to the <hi>Times,</hi> insomuch that no meaner Father than St. <hi>Ambrose,</hi> or worse <hi>Critick</hi> than <hi>Erasmus,</hi> read the Text <hi>Romans</hi> 12.11. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Serving the Time.</hi> A <hi>Reading</hi> countenanced by the Context, <hi>Rejoycing in Hope, patient in Tribulation, continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Prayer</hi>; all being Directions of our demeanour in dangerous times. And even those who dislike the <hi>Reading</hi> as false, defend the <hi>Doctrine</hi> as <hi>true</hi>; that though we must not be <hi>Slaves</hi> and <hi>Vassals,</hi> we may be <hi>Servants to the Times,</hi> so far forth as not to <hi>Dis-serve</hi> God thereby.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Sinless</hi> and <hi>lawful Agreeableness with the Times,</hi> is partly <hi>Passive,</hi> partly <hi>Active. Passive</hi> chiefly consisteth in <hi>Bearing</hi> and <hi>Forbearing: Bearing,</hi> in paying all Pecuniary burdens imposed; it being but equal (in my opinion) there to return <hi>Tribute</hi> where we receive <hi>Protection.</hi> I doubt not but in this point even the <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> himself is <hi>agreeable to the Times,</hi> going along with the rest of his Neighbours in their paying of all publick Taxes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Forbearing</hi> expresseth it self, first in <hi>Silence.</hi> The <hi>Spanish</hi> Proverb, true at all, is necessary in dangerous, Times, <hi>Where the mouth is shut no Fly doth enter</hi>: Yea, the Spirit of God giveth his Servants this counsel, <note n="*" place="margin">Amos 5.13.</note> 
                  <hi>Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that Time, for it is an evil Time.</hi> Thus, <hi>Holding of ones peace,</hi> that is,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61668:9"/>
using no <hi>Provoking Language</hi> against the <hi>Present Power,</hi> procureth <hi>Holding of ones Peace,</hi> that is, retaining and possessing of one's <hi>Safety</hi> and <hi>Quiet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Forbearing</hi> consisteth in <hi>Refraining</hi> (though not without secret sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row) <hi>from some Laudable Act</hi> which he heartily desireth, but dares not doe, as visibly destructive to his <hi>Person</hi> and <hi>Estate,</hi> being prohibited by the Predominant Powers: In such a Case a man may, to use the <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7 26.</note> 
                  <hi>Apostle</hi>'s phrase, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>for the present necessity,</hi> omit many things Pleasing to, but not Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by that God, who preferreth <hi>Mercy</hi> before <hi>Sacrifice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For instance; If any <hi>Earthly Prince</hi> or <hi>Power</hi> should enjoyn a <hi>Christian</hi> (as <hi>Darius</hi> did <note place="margin">Dan. 6.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Daniel</hi>) <hi>not to pray to God for the space of Thirty dayes together</hi>; his Command is not to be obeyed, as contrary to Gods positive Precept, <note place="margin">1 Tehss. 5.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually.</hi> But if he should onely enjoyn him to forbear <hi>such a Form of Prayer,</hi> allowing him liberty to use any other; I conceive that such an omission, Lawful; dictated unto him by the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Prudence,</hi> for his self-<hi>Preservation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Active</hi> Part of <hi>Lawful Agreeableness</hi> with the times, is in doing what they enjoyn, as being Indifferent; and sometimes so good, that our own Conscience doth or should enjoyn the same. In such a case, where there is a <hi>Concurrence</hi> of Both together, it is neither <hi>Dishonesty,</hi> nor <hi>Indiscretion,</hi> for one in himself to conceal his own Inclinations, and publickly to put his Actions (as Fasting, Thanksgiving, Preaching, &amp;c.) on the Account of <hi>Conformity to the Times</hi>; it being (as <hi>flattery</hi> to court, so no less) folly to contemne and reject the favour of the Times, when it may be had without the least violation, yet possibly with an Improvement of our own Conscience.</p>
               <p>I have Endevoured to steer my Carriage by the <hi>Compass</hi> aforesaid; and my main Motive thereunto was, that I might enjoy the Benefit of my <hi>Ministry,</hi> the bare using whereof, is the greatest <hi>Advancement</hi> I am capable of in this Life. I know all Stars, are not of the same <hi>Bigness</hi> and <hi>Brightness</hi>; some <hi>shine,</hi> some only <hi>twinkle</hi>; and allowing my Self of the latter Size and Sort, I would not willingly put out my own (though dimme) light in total Darkness, nor would bury my <hi>halfe-Talent,</hi> hoping by putting it forth to gain an other <hi>half-Talent</hi> thereby to the Glory of God, and the good of others.</p>
               <p>But it will be <hi>Objected</hi> against me, that it is suspicious (at the least) that I have <hi>Bribed the Times,</hi> with some <hi>base Compliance</hi> with them, because they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected so favourably upon me. Otherwise, how cometh it to pass, that <hi>my fleece,</hi> like <hi>Gideons,</hi> is <hi>dry,</hi> when the rest of my <hi>Brethren</hi> of the <hi>same party,</hi> are <hi>wet</hi> with their own <hi>Tears</hi>; I being permitted <hi>Preaching,</hi> and <hi>peaceable Enjoying</hi> of a <hi>Parsonage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I answer first, I impute this Peaceableness I enjoy, to Gods undeserved Goodness on my Unworthiness. <hi>He hath not dealt thus with all my Brethren,</hi> above me in <hi>all</hi> respects. God maketh People sometimes, <hi>potius reperire quàm invenire Gratiam, to find the Favours they sought not for.</hi> If I am one of them, whom God <note place="margin">Psal. 106.46.</note> hath made <hi>to be pitied of those who carried me away captive,</hi> I hope, I shall be thankful unto Him; and Others, I hope, will not be Envious at me for so great a Mercy.</p>
               <p>Next to the <hi>Fountain</hi> of <hi>Gods Goodness,</hi> I ascribe my Liberty of Preaching, to the <hi>Favour</hi> of some <hi>Great Friends,</hi> God hath raised up for me. It was not a Childish answer, though the answer of a Child to his Father taxing him for being Proud of his New <hi>Coat, I am glad</hi> (said he,) <hi>but not proud of it.</hi> Give me leave to be glad, and joyful in my self, <hi>for my Good Friends</hi>; and to desire, and endevour their Continuance and increase. <hi>A Friend in the Court</hi> hath alwayes been accounted as <hi>Good as a Penny, in the Councel; as a Pound, in the Purse.</hi> Nor will any rational man Condemn me, for making my Addresses to, and improvement of them, seeing the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> himself (as I am informed) hath his <hi>Friend</hi> in the <hi>Councel</hi>; and it is not long since, he had Occasion to make use of his Favour.</p>
               <p>I must not forget the <hi>Articles of Exeter,</hi> whereof I had the Benefit, living, and waiting there on the <hi>Kings Daughter</hi> at the <hi>Rendition</hi> thereof. <hi>Articles,</hi> which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61668:10"/>
both as <hi>Penned,</hi> and <hi>Performed</hi> were the best in <hi>England,</hi> thanks to their <hi>Wisdome,</hi> who so <hi>Warily made</hi>; and <hi>Honesty,</hi> who so <hi>well observed</hi> them. Nor was it (though last named) least causal of my Quiet, that (Happy Criticism to my self as I may call it) I never was <hi>formally sequestred,</hi> but <hi>went,</hi> before <hi>driven</hi> away from my Living, which took of the <hi>Edge</hi> off the <hi>Ordinance</hi> against me, that the Waight thereof fell but <hi>slentingly</hi> upon me. Thus when God will fasten a favour on any Person, (though never so unworthy) he ordereth the <hi>Concurrences</hi> of all things <hi>contributive</hi> thereunto.</p>
               <p>All I will add is this, that hitherto (and I hope, Who hath, will keep me I speak it in the presence of God) I have not by my <hi>Pen,</hi> or <hi>Practice</hi> to my knowledge done any thing <hi>Unworthily</hi> to the betraying of the Interest of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; and if it can be proved, Let my <hi>Mother-Church not onely spit in my face</hi> (the expression it seems of <note n="*" place="margin">Numb. 12.14.</note> Parents amongst the <hi>Iews</hi> when they were offended with their Children for some misdemeanor) but also <hi>spew me out of her mouth.</hi> Some will say, such a Vaunt savoreth of a <hi>Pharisaical</hi> Pride. I utterly deny it. For even the <hi>Publican</hi> after he came from his Confession he had made in the <hi>Temple</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Luk. 18.13.</note> 
                  <hi>God be merciful to me a Sinner,</hi> had he met one in the outward Court, accusing and taxing him with such particular Sins, whereof he was guiltless, would no doubt have replied in his own just defence. And seeing I am on my <hi>Purgation,</hi> in what the Schools term <hi>Iustitia Causae</hi> (though not <hi>Personae</hi>) I cannot say less, (as I will no more) in my <hi>Iustification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have I represented the <hi>Reader</hi> with the <hi>True Complexion</hi> of my <hi>Cause,</hi> and though I have not painted the <hi>

                     </gap>ace</hi> thereof with <hi>false Colours,</hi> I hope I have washed from it the <hi>foul Aspersion</hi> of <hi>Temporizing</hi> or <hi>sinful Agreeableness with the Times,</hi> which the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> causlesly casts upon it.</p>
               <p>So much for my <hi>Outward Carriage</hi> in reference to the <hi>Times</hi>; Mean time what the <hi>Thoughts</hi> of my <hi>Heart</hi> have been thereof. I am not bound to make a Discovery to my Own Danger. Sure I am, such who <hi>are</hi>

                  <p>He hath done me more—right, than he was aware of, or was willing to do: for those indeed were the <hi>three principal Motives</hi> of my weak Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in my Church-History.

                  <p>The words of <hi>St. Paul</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.8. <hi>Non possumus aliquid adversus veritatem sed pro veritate, We can do nothing against the Truth but for the Truth</hi>; well fitted the mouth of the Apostle, divinely inspired in his writings, only to be a <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion</hi> for the <hi>Truth.</hi> In one sense I allow them also applicable to the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertor, according to the received Rule <hi>Illud possumus, quod jure possumus, We can do that which we can lawfully do</hi> —. But otherwise, I humbly conceive that St. <hi>Paul could not,</hi> and the <hi>Animadvertor should not,</hi> do any thing against the Truth.</p>
                  <p>All that I will add is this, that although the Doctor be pleased to call his notes <hi>Necessary Animadversions,</hi> (who can blame the loving Father for giving his own dear Babe a good name) yet upon serious examination it will appear that <hi>some</hi> of these <hi>Animadversions,</hi> ought to have been omitted, for the promoting of Piety; and <hi>many</hi> of them might have been omitted, without any prejudice to the Truth: as in due time and place, God willing, shall be observed.</p>

                  <p>It is affirmed of History by the famous Orator, that it is <hi>Testis Temporum,</hi> the Witness and Record of Time, by which the Actions of it are transmitted from one Age to another. And therefore it concerns all those who apply themselves to the writing of Histories to take speciall care, that all things be laid down exactly, faithfully, and without Deviation from the Truth in the least particular; For if the Witnesses be suborned, the Record falsified, or the Evidence wrested, neither posterity can Judge rightly of the Actions of this present time; or this time, give a certain Judgement of the Ages past.</p>

                  <p>I acknowledge that this is the Character of a Complete <hi>Historian,</hi> to which all in their Writings ought to aspire with their best endeavours; though I believe none ever attained to the height thereof.</p>
                  <p>But first I would fain know, (seeing these are <hi>Necessary Animadversions</hi>) what need there was of that long-<hi>Latine</hi>-Line (staved off at last with an <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) seeing <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sephus</hi> did write in Greek. And if the Doctor would have presented us with the Original, it should have been in Greek; if but with a Translation, it might only have been in English.</p>
                  <p>I behold <hi>Iosephus</hi> as a worthy Historian, whose memory I deservedly honour; yet herein he might say with the Poet, <hi>Monitis sum minor ipse meis.</hi> He in his Practise fell far short of his Precepts, witness his inserting of this false passage, opposite to the very Letter of the Old Testament, speaking of <hi>Iehojakaim</hi> King of <hi>Iudah,</hi>

Some who endevouring to be copious, clap all together in a huddle which is offered to them, without relation to the Ornaments and Attire of Language; and others with like carelesness as unto themselves, but greater inconvenience as unto the Reader, examine not the truth and certainty of what they write, so they write somewhat which they think may inform the Reader.

                  <p>These things considered as they ought, hath made me wonder many times at the unadvisedness of some late Writers in this kind, whose Histories are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed with so much partiality on the one Side, and so much inadvertency on the Other; that they stand more in need of a <hi>Commentator</hi> to expound the Truth, and lay it clear and open to the view of the Reader, than either the dark words of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> or any other obscure Piece of the ancient Writers. I speak of <hi>Histories,</hi> not <hi>Libels</hi>; of which last sort, I reckon <hi>Weldon</hi>'s Pamphlet, called <hi>The Court of King Iames</hi>; and <hi>Wilson</hi>'s most infamous <hi>Pasquil</hi> of the Reign of that King: in which it is not easie to judge, whether the Matter be more false, or the Stile more reproachful in all parts thereof. Certain I am, we may affirm of them as <hi>Cremutius Cordus</hi> doth of the <hi>Epistles</hi> of <hi>Antonius,</hi> and the <hi>Orations</hi> of <hi>Brutus, Falsa quidem in Augustum probra, sed multa cum acerbitate habent</hi>; that is to say, that they contained not only false and disgraceful passages against the honour of <hi>Augustus,</hi> but were apparelled also in the habit of scurrilous language. With such as these I shall not meddle at the present, leaving their crimes unto the punishment not of an <hi>Index,</hi> but an <hi>Ignis Expurgatorius,</hi> as most proper for them.</p>

that when <hi>Wilson</hi>'s Book in <hi>Manuscript</hi> was brought unto him, he expunged out of it more than an hundred <hi>offensive</hi> passages. <hi>My Lord,</hi> said I) <hi>you have done well, and you had done better if you had put out one hundred more.</hi>

                  <p>In both I find the Truth much injured, and in one the Church.

                  <p>If not (for I am at a reasonable pass for that) it shall be no small comfort to me, that the weak Candle of my Studyes hath given light to others, whereby they may discern some Historical Truths even in the darkest mists of Error, which either Partiality or Incogitance hath cast before the eyes of many Readers.</p>

                  <p>Which said, I shall now add no more, but that having two Patients under cure of different tempers, it is not to be thought, that I should administer unto both the same kind of Physick, an ordinary purge being sufficient for the one, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the foul body of the other doth require a <hi>Fluxing</hi>; as some wounds may be healed with Balm, when others more corrupt and putrified do exact a <hi>Lancing.</hi>

                  <p>I will use no harsher <hi>Metaphor</hi> in relation of my answers to my two <hi>Antagonists,</hi> than only, That <hi>men</hi> may meddle with a <hi>Mallow</hi> with <hi>naked</hi> hands, but need to put on their <hi>Hedging</hi>-gloves when to deal with a <hi>Thorn</hi> or <hi>Nettle.</hi>

                  <p>But so it happeneth many times, that some men are more impatient of the Cure, then sensible of their Diseases; and that, in stead of giving thanks to to the Physitian, for the great pains he took about them, they pay him with nothing but displeasures.

not obtrude upon the Reader (either through Ignorance, inadvertency, or somewhat worse) such and so many falsities, mistakes, and errors, as have been lately put upon him in some modern Histories; It is that I aimed at, and having gained that point, I have gained my purpose.</p>

                  <p>This <hi>Distick,</hi> whereof the <hi>Animadvertor,</hi> (by the immediate subscription of his name thereunto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may to some seem the <hi>Author,</hi> is frequently cited by Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi> and may thus be <hi>Englished,</hi>

                  <p>However I humbly conceive, that (what faults soever I am guilty of) the sin of Sloth cannot justly, especially in my Church-History, be laid to my charge.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. All passages of <hi>Church-concernment</hi> from the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, untill King <hi>Henry</hi> the sixth, I got exactly written and attested out of the Records in the Tower.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The most material transactions in all Convocations since the Reformation till the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (save that sometimes the Journals be very defective, which was no fault of mine,) I transcribed out of the Registers of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. I have by much labour procured many <hi>Letters</hi> and other Rarities (which formerly never did see the light) out of the Library of Sir <hi>Thomas Cotton</hi> and others.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The learned Mr. <hi>Selden</hi> (on his own desire) honoured my first four Centuries with reading, and returned them unto me some weeks after; without any considerable alterations.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The best Antiquaries of <hi>England</hi> (amongst whom the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> it being not then my happiness to be known to the <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> Sir <hi>R. Twisden,</hi>) I consulted with; These now I forbear to name, lest I remove and derive the Animadvertors anger on them from my self, who am (though not the most able) the best prepared to endure his displeasure.</p>
                  <p>Give me leave to add, that a greater volume of general Church-Historie might
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61668:15"/>
be made with less time, pains, and cost: for in the making thereof, I had <hi>Straw</hi> provided me to burn my <hi>Brick</hi>; I mean, could find what I needed, in printed Books. Whereas in this Brittish Church-History, I must (as well as I could) provide my own Straw, and my pains have been scattered all over the Land, by riding, writing, going, sending, chiding, begging, praying, and sometimes pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too, to procure manuscript materials.</p>
                  <p>These particulars seriously considered, I hope it will appear, that the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertor unjustly chargeth <hi>Sloth</hi> on my account, and Tyrannically crieth out with <hi>Pharoah,</hi>

                  <p>INtending some short Animadversions on the <hi>Church-History of Brittain,</hi> for Vindication of the Truth, the Church, and the injured Clergy, I have thought good to prepare the way unto them by a plain, but <hi>necessary Introduction,</hi> touching the Quality and Nature of the Book which I have in hand.</p>

                  <p>Intending, God willing, to return a true, clear, and short Answer to the <hi>Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> I conceived it requisite to premise these few lines following.</p>
                  <p>The Animadvertor like a Cunning <hi>Market-man,</hi> hath put his best <hi>Corn</hi> in the <hi>top</hi> of his <hi>Sack</hi> to invite <hi>Chapmen</hi> to <hi>buy</hi> it. His Preface hath a <hi>Decoction</hi> of his whole Book, which was advisedly done by him, hoping that those might read his <hi>Preface</hi> whom he suspected would never <hi>peruse</hi> his <hi>Book.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Reader, As I am loath, any thing in his Book should not be <hi>once</hi> Answered, so be not offended, if to avoid repetition, I am loath it should be <hi>twice</hi> answered. Each particular in the Preface will recurre in the body of the Book, where (by Gods assistance) no emphatical word nor syllable shall pass without its respective reply.</p>
                  <p>Nor hath the Reader any cause to suspect, that by such shifting I intend any Evasion, by pleading in the <hi>Preface,</hi> that I will answer objections in the <hi>Body of my Book,</hi> and alledging in the Body of my Book, that I have answered them in the <hi>Preface.</hi> For I have to do with the Animadvertor, so cunning and so exacting a Merchant, that it is impossible for one indebted unto him, to escape without full <hi>payment,</hi> by changing the place of his habitation.</p>
                  <p>However the Animadvertor hath dealt severely (to say no worse) with me, who, to render me the more culpable, and my Book of the less credit, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented all my faults in a <hi>Duplicating Glass</hi>; And whereas the <hi>Best of Beings, non bis judicat in id ipsum, doth not punish the same faults twice,</hi> he hath twice taxed every supposed mistake in my History, once in his Preface, and again, in the Body of his Book.</p>

                     <hi>Charity begins, but doth not end, at home.</hi> The same Method was embraced in my <hi>Church-History.</hi> It began with our own <hi>Domestick affairs,</hi> to confute that accusation, commonly charged on <hi>Englishmen,</hi> that they are very knowing in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain parts, but ignorant in their own Country. I intended (God willing) to have proceeded to forrain Churches, but I am discouraged by the causless cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at what I have written already.</p>
                  <p>My Church-History beginneth (for point of Time) <hi>Indeterminately</hi> before the <hi>Birth of Christ,</hi> (<hi>lapping</hi> in, or <hi>folding</hi> over part of Paganisme) and presenteth the dolefull condition of the <hi>Britons,</hi> whilest yet unconverted, and grievious Idolaters.</p>

                     <hi>Determinately,</hi> my History begins Anno Dom. 37. which is but four years after <hi>Christs</hi> Passion, and that is very early, I assure you: Christianity in this Island, being a <hi>Timely riser,</hi> to be <hi>up so soon,</hi> and <hi>dressing it Self,</hi> whilest as yet (and many years after) most Countreys were <hi>fast asleep</hi> in <hi>Pugan Impiety,</hi>

                  <p>I deny not but that Apostolical men, were the first founders of Religion in our Land. But as for such Apostles, (St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>Paul, &amp;c.</hi>) who without probability of Truth, and against proportion of Time, are by some Authors obtruded on us, those I do reject, (I hope, without the least <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I will render the Reader a true account, why I entitled my Book, The <hi>Church-History of Brittain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>First, the <hi>Church-History of England</hi> I might not call it, the <hi>five first Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> therein belonging wholly to the <hi>Brittains</hi> before the Name and Notion of <hi>England,</hi> was ever heard of in any Author.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The <hi>Church-History of Great-Brittain,</hi> I did not call it; for fear of bringing in <hi>Scotland</hi> within the Latitude thereof, a compass too large for my weak Endeavours.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The <hi>Church-History of Brittain,</hi> I did, and might call it, in a double respect, <hi>tam à parte Majore, quàm meliore,</hi> both from the <hi>bigger</hi> and <hi>better,</hi> the <hi>fairer</hi> and <hi>fruitfuller</hi> part of <hi>Brittain,</hi> the Ecclesiastical affairs whereof were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in contained.</p>
                  <p>Yea the Animadvertor knows full well, that the South of this Island, <hi>by way of Eminence</hi> is so called: To give one Instance of many, from the Title-page, of a passage of State.
<q>Nobilissima disceptatio super Dignitate &amp; magnitudine Regnorum Britannici Et Gallici, habita ab utriusque Oratoribus &amp; Legatis, in Concilio Constantiensi; Lovanii, anno <hi>1517.</hi> Typis excusa.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The most noble Dispute, about the Dignity and greatness</hi> of the Kingdomes of <hi>Brittain</hi> and <hi>France, betwixt the Embassadors and Legates of both Sides, in the Councell of Constance; Anno</hi> 1517. <hi>printed at Lovaine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here the contest only was betwixt the Crowns of <hi>England</hi> [here termed <hi>Brittain</hi>] and <hi>France, Scotland</hi> not at all interesting it self therein.</p>
                  <p>It will not be long before the Animadvertor (as, God willing, in due time shall be observed) stickleth with <hi>might</hi> and <hi>main,</hi> that <hi>Lucius</hi> might properly style himself, and be styled <hi>King of Brittain,</hi> who had not an <hi>half</hi> of the <hi>Southern-half</hi> of this Island: and therefore, by his own Principles, it is no Solecisme in me, to name the <hi>cis-Tweedan Moity</hi> thereof, <hi>Brittain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Had I given my native Countrey a <hi>narrow</hi> and <hi>restrictive</hi> name, I had deserved due reproof; but now, measuring the <hi>denomination</hi> thereof, with all <hi>honourable advantage,</hi> I humbly conceive my self not to fall under just reprehension for the same.</p>

                  <p>Nor is it, thirdly, a <hi>Church-History</hi> rightly and properly so called, but an aggregation of such and so many <hi>Heterogeneous</hi> bodies, that <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> affairs make the least part of it. Abstracted from the dresse and trimming, and all those outward imbelishments which appear upon it, it hath a very fit resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to that <hi>Lady of pleasure</hi> of which <hi>Martial</hi> tells us, <hi>Pars minima est ipsa puella sui,</hi> that the woman was the least part of her self. The name of a <hi>Church-Rhapsody</hi> had been fitter for it, though to say truth (had it been answerable thereunto in point of learning) it might have past by the old Title of <hi>Fuller's Miscellanies.</hi> For such and so many are the impertinencies, as to matters of <hi>Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall</hi> nature, more as to matters of the Church, that without them this great Volume had been brought to a narrower compass, if it had taken up any room at all.

                  <p>The <hi>Animadvertor</hi> hath a free liberty to name His own <hi>Books</hi>; and I crave the same leave <hi>my self,</hi> to denominate My own.</p>
                  <p>Before he had fallen so fiercely on my extravagancies in the <hi>Church-Historie,</hi> he had done well to have defended <hi>his own,</hi> in his <hi>Geographie; sixteen</hi> parts of <hi>twenty</hi> therein being meerly <hi>Historicall,</hi> and <hi>aliene</hi> from his Subject in the strictness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

                  <p>But because <hi>Recrimination</hi> is no part of <hi>Purgation,</hi> I provide my self to answer to all which shall be objected for impertinencies.</p>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>The first of this kind which I am to note, is a meer <hi>extrinsecall</hi> and outside unto those impertinencies which are coucht within; consisting of <hi>Title-Pages, Dedicatory-Epistles,</hi> and severall intermediate <hi>Inscriptions</hi> unto every Section. A new way, never travelled before by any, till he found it out; and such where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is not like to find many followers, though the way be opened. I know it is no unusuall thing for works of different Arguments, publisht at severall times, and dedicated to severall persons, to be drawn together into one Volume; and being so drawn together, to retain still those particular <hi>Titles</hi> and <hi>Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> which at first they had. But I dare confidently say, that our Historian is the first, who writing a Book of the same Argument, not published by peece-meal, as it came from his hand, but in a full and intire Volume, hath filled his Sheets with so many <hi>Title-leaves</hi> and <hi>Dedications,</hi> as we have before us.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fuller.</speaker>
                  <p>I answer first, Although it be unlawfull even for the owner himself <hi>abuti re sua, to abuse</hi> what is his own, because the <hi>Publick</hi> hath an interest therein; Yet, <note n="*" place="margin">Math. 5.10.</note> 
                     <hi>Is it not lawfull for me to Do, what I will with my Own?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, seeing the Animadvertor pretendeth in his notes to rectifie <hi>Mistakes, Falsities,</hi> and <hi>Defects,</hi> this cometh not under any of these notions. And whereas he writeth (as he saith) for the Vindication of the <hi>Truth, Church,</hi> and <hi>injured-Clergy</hi>;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61668:17"/>
by my dedicating of my Book to many Patrons, the Truth is not prejudiced, nor the <hi>Church wronged,</hi> nor any of the <hi>Clergy injured.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Of late some <hi>usefull</hi> and <hi>costly</hi> Books, when past their Parents power <hi>to bring them forth,</hi> have been <hi>delivered</hi> to the Publick, by the <hi>Midwifery</hi> of such Dedications.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Many (if not most) of my <hi>Patrons</hi> invited themselves purposely to encourage my endevours; And why should <hi>any mans eye be evil,</hi> because theirs were <hi>good unto me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, It is all one in effect, whether one printeth his Dedications to many <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,</hi> or whether one presenteth a printed <hi>History of St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> George, to each English Knight of the Garter,</hi> with a written <note n="*" place="margin">As in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  <p>For in this one Book, taking in the History of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> which is but an Appendix to it, there are no fewer than twelve particular Titles, besides the generall; as many particular Dedications; and no fewer then fifty eight or sixty of those By-Inscriptions, which are addrest to his particular Friends and Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nay, so ambitious he is of increasing the Number of his Patrons, that having but four Leaves to come to the end of his History, he finds out a particular <hi>Benefactress</hi> to inscribe it to: Which brings to my minde the vanity of <hi>Vitellius</hi> in bestowing, and of <hi>Roscius, Regulus</hi> for accepting the Consular Dignity, for that part of the day on which <hi>Cecinna,</hi> by Order and Decree of the Senate, was degraded from it: Of which the Historian gives this Note, that it was, <hi>Magno cum irrisu accipientis tribuentisque,</hi> a matter of no mean dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port amongst the People for a long time after.</p>

                  <p>Ordinary Dedications exceed not a dozen lines, and therefore I believe the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> is much mistaken in his proportions.</p>
                  <p>If I did Dedicate <hi>four leaves</hi> to a <hi>distinct Patroness,</hi> no such fault therein; seeing, I am confident, those four leaves contain in them so <hi>remarkable</hi> an <hi>Accident,</hi> as the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> never read the like in four thousand leaves of any <hi>Historian.</hi>

                  </speaker>
                  <p>But of this Argument our Author heard so much at the late Act at <hi>Oxford,</hi> that I shall say no more of it at this present time.</p>

                  <p>I heard nothing thereof at <hi>Oxford,</hi> being then sixty miles distanced thence. Sure I am, I did not there <hi>Malè audire</hi> deservedly; and if undeservedly, <hi>mala fama bene parta delectat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, I have heard since, that <hi>one</hi> in the Act, was bold to play on my own name <hi>and Church-History.</hi> But for the seventeen years I lived in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> I never heard any Prevaricator mention his <hi>Senior by name</hi>: We count such <hi>particularizing</hi> beneath an <hi>University.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I hope it will not be accounted <hi>Pride,</hi> but Prudence in me, to believe my self above such Trifles, who have written <hi>a Book to Eternity.</hi>

                  <p>They are never used without <hi>asking of leave</hi> before, or craving pardon after the inserting thereof; and such <hi>craving</hi> is <hi>having</hi> a request in that kind with the Ingenious.

                  <p>And secondly, The Honor of Lord Chamberlain of <hi>England,</hi> came not unto the Earls of <hi>Oxford</hi> by that Marriage, or by any other, but was invested in that Family, before they had attained the Title and Degree of Earls: Conferred by King <hi>Henry</hi> the first on <hi>Aubrey de Vere,</hi> a right puissant Person, and afterwards on <hi>Aubrey de Vere</hi> his Son, together with the Earldome of <hi>Oxford,</hi> by King <hi>Henry</hi> the second; continuing Hereditary in that House, till the death of <hi>Robert</hi> Duke of <hi>Ireland,</hi> the ninth Earl thereof, and then bestowed for a time at the Kings discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and at last setled by King <hi>Charls</hi> in the House of <hi>Lindsey.</hi>

                  </p>

                  <p>What he warily said <hi>laid hid,</hi> is <hi>found out</hi> by such as since wrote on that Subject, Mr. <hi>Brooke, York Herald,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Augustine Vincent</hi> (in effect Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed;) who writing <hi>Corrections</hi> on <hi>Brooke,</hi>

Proceed we in the next place to Verses, and old ends of Poetry, scattered and dispersed in all parts of the History, from one end to the other; for which he hath no precedent in any Historian, Greek or Latine, or any of the National Histories of these latter times: The Histories of <hi>Herodotus, Xenophon, Thucidides</hi> and <hi>Plutarch,</hi> amongst the Greeks; of <hi>Caesar, Livy, Salust, Tacitus,</hi> and <hi>Suetonius,</hi> amongst the Latines; afford him neither warrant nor example for it: The like may be affirmed of <hi>Eusebius, Socrates, Sozomen, Theodoret, Ruffin</hi> and <hi>Evagrius,</hi> Church-Historians all; though they had all the best choice, and the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Poets of the world to befriend them in it: And he that shall consult the Historyes of succeeding times, through all the Ages of the Church, to this present day, will find them all as barren of any incouragements in this kind, as the ancients were.</p>

                  <p>But what alas were eighteen or twenty verses compared with those many hundred (six or seven hundred at the least) which we find in our Author, whether to shew the universality of his reading in all kind of Writers, or his faculty in Translating (which when he meets with hard Copies, he knows how to spare) I shall not determine at the present.</p>

                  <p>If <hi>peeces</hi> of verses be counted <hi>whole ones,</hi> which in this point is no Charitable <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> and if Translations be reckoned distinct Verses, though it is hard that a <hi>Man</hi> and his <hi>Shadow</hi> should be accounted two different persons:</p>
                  <p>And if the verses in the History of <hi>Cambridge</hi> be adjected, though he who banisheth <hi>Poetry</hi> out of an <hi>University,</hi> will find <hi>Iambicks</hi> enough to pay him for his pains:</p>
                  <p>And if the verses in the History of <hi>Waltham-Abby</hi> be cast in, though who

shall hinder but I will describe my own Parish in <hi>Prose</hi> or <hi>Poetry</hi> as I think fit; all put together will not amount to the number.</p>
                  <p>Besides many of my verses may be said to be <hi>Prose in Effect,</hi> as containing the <hi>Religion</hi> of that Age, and therefore alledged as <hi>Evidence</hi> thereof, before the <hi>Norman Conquest</hi>; and no authority can in <hi>Prose</hi> be produced which doth so fully and cleerly represent the same.</p>
                  <p>Other Verses are generally Epitaphs on some eminent <hi>Church-men,</hi> which could not well be omitted.</p>

                  <p>Certain I am, that by the interlarding of his Prose with so many Verses, he makes his Book look rather like a <hi>Church-Romance,</hi> (our late <hi>Romancers</hi> being much given to such kind of mixtures) than a well-built <hi>Ecclesiastical History.</hi> And if it be a matter so inconvenient to put a <hi>new peice of cloth on an old garment</hi>; the putting of so many <hi>old</hi> patches on a <hi>new peice of cloth,</hi> must be more unfashion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.

                  <p>Had the Animadvertor come with a <hi>good stomach,</hi> such <hi>larding</hi> had been no <hi>bad Cookery.</hi> Certain I am, that a <hi>Comment</hi> admitteth less latitude in this kind than a <hi>Church-History.</hi> Certain I am also, that a <hi>Comment on the Creed,</hi> is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed less Liberty then <hi>other Comments.</hi> Now the Animadvertor hath be scattered <hi>his,</hi> every where with Verses, and Translations. It consisteth not with my Charity to miscall it a <hi>Creed-Romance,</hi> accounting it a sin so to decry or disparage his usefull endevours. The best way to discover the deformity of my Fabrick, is for the Animadvertor to erect a more beautifull Building hard by it, that so his <hi>rare</hi> and <hi>regular,</hi> may shame my <hi>rude</hi> peece of Architecture.</p>
                  <p>What if such mixtures make the Garment (which also I utterly deny) to be less in the <hi>fashion</hi> (the fondling of Fancy;) I made it not for <hi>Sight</hi> but <hi>Service,</hi> that it might be <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>warm</hi> to the Wearers thereof.</p>
                  <p>I stand on my justification, that no such <hi>light</hi> or <hi>ludicrous</hi> Verses are to be found in my Book, which render it to just exception. But no wonder if the <hi>Bel clinketh</hi> even as the prejudic'd Hearer <hi>thinketh thereof.</hi>

                  <p>This leads me to the next impertinency, his raking into the Chanel of old <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Legends,</hi> writ in the darker times of Superstition, but written with an honest zeal, and a good intention, as well to raise the Reader to the admiration of the person of whom they write, as to the emulation of his virtues: But being mixt with some <hi>Monkish</hi> dotages, the most learned and ingenious men in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have now laid them by; and it had been very well if our Author had done so to, but that there must be something of entertainment for the gentle Reader, and to inflame the reckoning which he pays not for.</p>

But standing as they do, they neither do become the gravity of a <hi>Church-Historian,</hi> nor are consistent with the nature of a sober argument.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Animadvertor</hi> should have rendred me liable to just Reproof, by instancing in One of those <hi>Tales</hi> so inconsistent with the gravity of a <hi>Church-Historian</hi>: which no doubt he had done, but because he knew himself unable to produce it.</p>
                  <p>He, who is often seen to <hi>snap hastily</hi> at, and <hi>feed hungerly</hi> on an <hi>hard crust,</hi> will not be believed if bragging that he can eat <hi>Pheasants</hi> and <hi>Partridges</hi> at his Pleasure. And seeing the <hi>Animadvertor,</hi> doth commonly carp and cavil at the <hi>silly shadows</hi> of seeming mistakes, in my Book; it is utterly improbable he can, yet will not, charge me with a fault, which cannot be defended.</p>
                  <p>But let him at leasure produce the most <hi>light</hi> and <hi>ludicrous</hi> Story in all my Book, and here I stand ready to Parallel it with as <hi>light,</hi> (I say not in the <hi>Animadvertor,</hi>) but in as <hi>Grave Authors</hi> as ever put Pen to Paper.</p>

                  <p>In the last place proceed we to the manifold excursions about the Antiquity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> built on as weak Authority as the <hi>Monkish</hi> Legends, and so impertinent
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61668:20"/>
to the matter which he hath in hand, that the most Reverend <hi>Mat. Parker</hi> (though a <hi>Cambridge</hi> man) in his <hi>Antiquitates Britannicae,</hi> makes no business of it.</p>
                  <p>The more impertinent, in regard that at the fag-end of his Book there fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a distinct History of that University, to which all former passages might have been reduced.</p>
                  <p>But, as it seems, he was resolved to insert nothing in that History but what he had some probable ground for; leaving the <hi>Legendary</hi> part thereof to the <hi>Church-Romance,</hi> as most proper for it. And certainly he is wondrous wise in his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>For fearing lest he might be asked for those <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Chartularies</hi> which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently he relates unto in the former Books, he tells us in the History of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> fol 53. That they were <hi>burnt</hi> by some of the seditious <hi>Townsmen in the open Market place, Anno</hi> 1380. or thereabouts: So that for want of other ancient evidence, we must take his word; which whether those of <hi>Cambridge</hi> will depend upon, they can best resolve.</p>
                  <p>For my part I forbear all intermedling in a controversie so clearly stated, and which hath lain so long asleep, till now awakened by our Author to beget new quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels: Such passages in that History as come under any <hi>Animadversion,</hi> have been reduced unto the other, as occasion served, which the Reader may be pleased to take notice of as they come before him.</p>

                  <p>Because omitted by Arch-Bishop <hi>Parker,</hi> I have the more Cause and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to insert it: Otherwise, had he handled the Subject before, the <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertor</hi> would have cryed out <hi>Crambe,</hi> that there was <hi>nothing novel</hi> therein.</p>
                  <p>Call it (I pray) The FRINGE of my Book, be it but for the <hi>Subjects</hi> sake, whereof it treats, my dear Mother, <hi>the University of Cambridge.</hi>

                  <p>Doth the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> now <hi>forbear</hi> all intermedling therein, in this Controversy? Why did he not <hi>forbear</hi> before, when setting forth his last <hi>Geography</hi> some five years since? And is it not as lawful for me to <hi>defend,</hi> as for him to <hi>oppose</hi> my <hi>Mother?</hi> When, where, and by whom, was <hi>this Controversie so clearly stated?</hi> Was it by the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> himself? Such a <hi>Party</hi> is unfit for a <hi>Iudge.</hi> Or, was it stated by the <hi>Parliament</hi> mentioned by him 1<hi rend="sup">mo.</hi> 
                     <hi>Iacobi,</hi> when, as he telleth us, the Clerk was commanded to place <hi>Oxford</hi> first.

                  <p>I answer first in general; Such the <hi>sympathy</hi> betwixt the embracing <hi>Twins, Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> that sometimes 'tis both painful and pity to part them. More parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, such passages have at the least a <hi>cast</hi> or <hi>eye</hi> of <hi>Church-colour</hi> in them, or else they are inserted for necessity, <hi>Ne detur vacuum,</hi> for meer lack of <hi>Church-matter.</hi> All the Ecclesiastical History in Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> during the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth, will not fill his hollow Pen, the cause why he makes it up with History of the State; and I sometimes do the like. Lastly, it is done for Variety, (and then, commonly, I crave the Readers leave) which I hope is no offence. Must I turn <hi>School-boy</hi> again, and the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> be my <hi>School-master,</hi> to give me a <hi>Theam,</hi> that I must write on no other Subject, but what he appoints me?</p>

                  <p>Of this sort to look no further, is the long Will and Testament of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, with his Gloss or Comment on the same, taking up three whole sheets at least, in which there is not any thing which concerns Religion, or which relates unto the Church, or Church-affairs; although to have the better colour to bring it in, he tells us that he hath transcribed it, not onely for the rarity thereof, but because it <hi>contained many passages which might reflect much light upon Church-History.</hi>

                  <p>I answer first, All ancient <hi>Wills</hi> have something of <hi>Sacredness</hi> in them, begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>In the name of God Amen.</hi> Secondly, they are proved in the <hi>Court-Christian,</hi> which evidenceth something of <hi>Ecclesiasticalness</hi> in them. Thirdly, <hi>Kings</hi> have ever been beheld as <hi>mixt Persons,</hi> wherein <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> are <hi>blended</hi> together. Fourthly, the <hi>Will</hi> of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, in that <hi>Active-juncture</hi> of times, is more than the <hi>Will</hi> of an <hi>ordinary King.</hi> Fiftly, it is most remarkable even in <hi>Church-History,</hi> if only on this Account, to shew that he who had violated the <hi>Testaments</hi> of so many <hi>Founders</hi> and <hi>Benefactors,</hi> had hardly any <hi>one Particular</hi> of his <hi>own Will</hi> performed. Sixthly, it never was, and perchance (had I not done it) never had been <hi>Printed</hi> Seventhly, false and imperfect Copies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of pass about in Manuscript. Lastly, I have received so much <hi>thanks</hi> from the <hi>Animadvertor</hi>'s Betters for printing of it, that I will freely pardon and pass by his causless cavil against me for the same.</p>

                  <p>But nothing does more evidently discover his unfaithfull dealing, then his report of the proceedings in the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> between his Majesty, and the long-Parliament Divines; of which he tells us, <hi>Lib.</hi> 11. <hi>fol.</hi> 235. <hi>That his Majesty, in the last Paper which he sent them, acknowledged their great pains to inform his Iudgement, according to their perswasions, and also took especial no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of their Civilities of the Application both in the beginning and body of their Reply</hi>; and having cleer'd himself from some mis-understanding about the Writ of <hi>Partition</hi> which they speak of, puts an end to the businesse. The man who reads this passage, cannot choose but think that his Majesty, being van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisht by the Arguments of the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> had given over the cause; and therefore, as convicted in his Conscience, rendreth them thanks for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction which he had received, and the Civilities they used towards him in the way thereof. But he that looks upon his Majestie's last Paper, will find that he had Learnedly and Divinely refel'd all their Arguments: And having so done, puts them in mind of three questions which are propos'd in his former Paper, acknowledged by themselves, to be of great importance in the present controversie; without an Answer whereunto, his Majesty declared that he would put an end to that conference: <hi>It not being probable</hi> (as he told them) <hi>that they should work much upon his Iudgement, whilst they are fearfull to declare their own, nor possible to relieve his conscience, but by a free declaring of theirs.</hi> But they not able, or not daring, (for fear of displeasing their great Masters) to return an Answer to those Questions, his Majesty remain'd sole Master of the field, a most absolute Conquerour: For though the first blow commonly does begin the Quarrel, it is the last blow always that gets the Victory: But <hi>Regium est cum benefeceris malè audire</hi>: It hath been commonly the fortune of the greatest Princes, when they deserve best, to be worst reported.</p>

                  <p>What need we put our selves or others to the charge of Surplices and Hoods, of Gowns and Cassacks, in the officiating of Gods Service; It is no matter in what habit the Body be, <hi>so the heart be right.</hi> There is another Chappel in <hi>Cambridge</hi> which was never <hi>consecrated,</hi> (whether a <hi>Stable</hi> or a <hi>Dormitory,</hi> is all one to me.) At which time when some found themselves grieved, our Author tells them, <hi>This others of us great Learning and Religion</hi> (himself espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

for one) <hi>dare defend, that the continued</hi> Series of Divine Duties, <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly practised for more then thirty years (without the least check or controul of those in authority) in a place set apart to that purpose, doth sufficiently consecrate the same: Stables</hi> and <hi>Barns</hi> by this Argument, shall in some tract of time become as sacred as our Churches.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fuller.</speaker>
                  <p>Had I lived in <hi>Sidney</hi> Colledge, when that <hi>Dormitory</hi> was first used for a <hi>Chappel,</hi> I would have <hi>advised,</hi> and (in my Sphere) <hi>advanced</hi> its consecration; accounting the Omission to fall under just reproof. But seeing it hath been so long omitted, I now conceive it hath no need of <hi>Consecration,</hi> seeing though never solemnly and formally dedicated to Divine Service by the <hi>Ordinary,</hi> (or one deputed by him) yet hath it had a <hi>tacite, &amp; interpretative</hi> Consecration, and thereby hath contracted a <hi>relative</hi> Sacrednesse. By the same <hi>Proportion,</hi> it is, that <hi>Utensils,</hi> long used in a Family, to most civill and generous imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by degrees acquire to themselves, the Reputation (in the Apostle's language) of <hi>vessels of honour</hi>; as being opposed to such vessels imployed in sordid (though necessary) Service, and of the same metal and matter.</p>
                  <p>I doubt not but if this place used for a Chappel (now about a Jubilee of years) should be turned to a <hi>Stable,</hi> the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> would behold it (and justly too) as a piece of Prophanation, and this <hi>intimates</hi> a <hi>Sacrednesse</hi> therein.</p>
                  <p>It is mainly material, that Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> of <hi>Ely,</hi> a Reverend Prelate, and as knowing as any of his Order in this point of Antiquity; knew this to be in his Diocesse, yet never manifested the least Regreet at the <hi>Chappelizing</hi> of this Place.</p>
                  <p>As for consecration of Churches and Chappels, I say; first, is no <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental action.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It is not of <hi>Evangelical Institution,</hi> as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himself doth freely confesse, no <hi>Express</hi> for it in the New-Testament.

                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is charitably to be presumed, that when Dr. <hi>Montague,</hi> and the fellows first entred the <hi>Dormitory,</hi> sequestring that place for a <hi>Chappel,</hi> they by Prayers and a Sermon, did solemnly consign it, to the Service of God: seeing no man of common Principles of Piety, will offer to eat meat, before he hath said <hi>Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Such Prayers did in some sort Dedicate the place, wanting no formality, save, because not done by a Bishop; and if this be all the fault can be found therein, let the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> prove, (<hi>probatio incumbit affirmanti</hi>) that in the <hi>primitive</hi> Times, consecrating of Churches was only an <hi>Episcopal Act.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, What was wanting in the consecration at the first, hath since suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently been supplyed and corroborated by usance thereof to Gods Service only.</p>
                  <p>If factious people, should, in peaceable times, against lawfull Authority con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticle in a <hi>Barn</hi> or <hi>Stable</hi>; their Meetings, (sinfull in themselves) could not derive any Sacrednesse to the place, whilst the World lasteth.</p>
                  <p>But if <hi>Persecution,</hi> which God of his goodness avert (though we by our wickednesse deserve it) should invade our Land; I conceive, Stables are, by Prayers, and presence of God's <hi>suffering Servants,</hi> and chiefly by God's presence with them, at the minute of their entrance thither, elevated into Holy places.</p>

                  <p>Not the solemnest Consecration, can advance our Churches into the same degree of Sacredness with <hi>Solomon's Temple,</hi> which was (yea might bee) but <hi>one,</hi> dignified (when dedicated) with God his <hi>Glorious</hi> Presence, 2 <hi>Chro.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Who chose that place to himself for an house of Sacrifice.</hi> It was the Type of our blessed Saviour, perfect in all Points, as made by inspired Architects; and the utensils in the <hi>Holy of Holiest,</hi> the self same which <hi>Moses</hi> made according to the pattern in the <hi>Mount.</hi>

                  <p>By which it seems, that our Author never meant to frame his History by the line of Truth, but to attemper it to the palat of the present Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whatsoever it then was, or should prove to be; which I am sure agrees not with the Laws of History.</p>
                  <p>And though I can most easily grant, that the fourth Book and the rest that follow, were written after the great alteration and change of State, in making a <hi>new</hi> Common-wealth out of the ruines of an ancient Monarchy; yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur not with our Author in the time of the former: For it appears by some passages, that the three first Books either were not all written in the time of the King, or else he must give himself some disloyal hopes, that the King should never be restored to his place and Power, by which he might be called to a reckoning for them.</p>

                     <hi>It Seems.</hi> [<hi>Multa videntur quae non sunt.</hi>] The Inference is false and forced; <hi>Titus Livius</hi> lived in <hi>Imperial,</hi> yet wrote of <hi>Regal, Consulatory, Tribunitial</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> without the least imputation of falshood.

                  <p>For in the second Book he reckons the Cross in Baptism for a Popish Trinket, by which it appears not, I am sure, to have been written in the time of Kingly Government, that being no expression sutable unto such a time.</p>

                  <p>Should I simply and absolutely call the Cross in Baptisme a <hi>Popish Trinket,</hi>

my <hi>fore-head</hi> (Signed therewith) would give my <hi>Tongue the lye,</hi> and return the <hi>Popery</hi> in the teeth thereof.

                  <p>Secondly, speaking of the precedency which was fixt in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving the Archiepiscopal See from <hi>London</hi> thither, he telleth us that <hi>the matter is not much, which See went first, when living; seeing our Age hath laid them both alike level in their Graves</hi>: But certainly the Government was not changed into a State or Commonwealth, till the death of the King; and till the death of the King, neither of those Episcopall Sees, nor any of the rest, were laid so level in <hi>their Graves,</hi> but that they were in hope of a Resurrection; the King declaring himself very constantly in the Treaty at the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> as well against the abolishing of the Episcopal Government, as the alienation of their Lands.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, In the latter end of the same Book, he makes a great dispute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the high and sacred priviledge of the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> in curing the disease comonly called the <hi>Kings Evil,</hi> whether to be imputed to <hi>Magick,</hi> or <hi>Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> or indeed a <hi>Miracle</hi>; next, brings us in an old Wives Tale about Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as if she had disclaimed that power she daily exercised; and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, manageth a Quarrel against the form of Prayer used at the curing of that Evil, which he arraigns for Superstition and impertinencies, no inferior Crimes: Are all these passages proper to that Government also?</p>
                  <p>Finally in the third Book, he derogates from the power of the Church in making <hi>Canons,</hi> giving the binding and concluding Power in matters which concern the civil Rights of the Subjects, not to the King, but to the Lay-people of the Land assembled in Parliament; which game he after followeth in the eighth and last: And though it might be safe enough for him in the eighth and last, to derogate in this manner from the King's supremacy in Ecclesiastical affairs; yet certainly it was neither safe for him so to do, nor proper for him so to write, in the time of the <hi>Kingly Government,</hi> unless he had some such wretched hopes as before we spake of.</p>

                  <p>I desire the Reader, to remember my late words, (as the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited them) <hi>FOR THE MAIN.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I confess, though these Books were written in the Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi>; yet after his Death, I interpolated some lines, and amongst others, that of <hi>level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> all <hi>Bishopricks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I raised no dispute against the <hi>Kings</hi> curing the <hi>Evil,</hi> it being raised be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was born, and which I endeavoured to <hi>allay,</hi> referring it to <hi>Miracle,</hi> as to the peruser of my History, in that place will appear. I tell no old Wives Tale of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> it being a <hi>Masculine Truth,</hi> from most authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Authors.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>derogate</hi> not, in the least degree, from the power of the Church; but the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> doth <hi>arrogate</hi> unto it more then is due, by the Lawes of God and Man: maintaining that Church-men may go beyond <hi>Ecclesiastical Censures,</hi> even to the Limbs and <hi>Lives</hi> of such! as are <hi>Recusants</hi> to their <hi>Constitutions.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>WRETCHED</hi> and what formerly he said <hi>DISLOYAL HOPES,</hi> I defie and return them <hi>in the Teeth</hi> of him that wrote the words.</p>

                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:61668:28"/>He had <hi>WRETCHED AND DISLOIAL HOPES,</hi> who wrote, that King <hi>Iames went to New-market,</hi> as <hi>Tiberius</hi> to his <hi>Capreae</hi>; he waved his <hi>Loyalty</hi> and <hi>Discretion</hi> together, who so saucily and un-subject-like counted, how often King <hi>Charles waved</hi> his Crown.</p>
                  <p>Here give me leave to tell the <hi>Animadvertor,</hi> that such whom he slighteth for <hi>LOW-ROYALISTS,</hi> were (whilst they had a King in <hi>England</hi>) as <hi>HIGH</hi> in their Loyalty to him, <hi>Prayers</hi> and Sufferings for him, as those <hi>HIGH-ROI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ALISTS,</hi> who maintain that all goods of the Subjects are at the King's <hi>abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Dispose,</hi> and yet since those Kings are departed this life, can write of them in so base and disparaging Language, that any one of the <hi>LOW-ROIALISTS,</hi> would have his right hand cut off, rather then write the like. <hi>Reader,</hi> pardon my too just passion, when <hi>DISLOIALTY</hi> is laid to my charge: It is with me <hi>Either now speak or else for ever hereafter hold your Peace.</hi>

                  <p>I make no other use hereof save only to crave the like Favour, in my own Defence, when in the <hi>Earls of March, Roger</hi> is misprinted <hi>Edward</hi>; and in the <hi>Earls of Bath, Henry</hi> is misprinted <hi>William,</hi> in my <hi>Church History.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I confess there be some Press faults in this my Book, as for <hi>Prelial,</hi> (wherever occurring) read <hi>Prelal</hi>; part 1. p. 50. l. 32. for <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 580 r. 560. part. 1. p. 52. l. 18. for <hi>DEMOL</hi> r. <hi>DEINOL.</hi> and part 2. page 88. betwixt the 33. and 34 l. insert I pray,</p>
                  <p>Papists, Non-conformists, and covetous Conformists, the Acts therein appearing like.</p>
                  <p>For the rest, I hope they are nothing so <hi>many</hi> or <hi>great,</hi> as to discompose the sense, and therefore I <hi>confide</hi> in the Reader's Discretion as also in the Animadvertor's Ingenuity, expecting he will deal as candidly with me, as I have done with him, when such (though unconfessed) Errata's do occur.</p>
                  <p>And because my hand is now in, I request such as have my <hi>Church-history</hi> to delete these words

                     <hi>Hoshea, He did that which was evill in the sight of the Lord, but not as the Kings of Israel that were before him.</hi> It doth not follow, that these Kings were good, because less bad then others.

                  <p>And though they were <hi>Idolaters,</hi> yea, and <hi>foul</hi> ones, as our Author hath it; yet neither, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>If they were <hi>Idolaters,</hi> they must be <hi>foul ones,</hi> except (as one hath <hi>fancied</hi> a <hi>tale</hi> of a <hi>fair Aethiopian</hi>) any could make a <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>fair Idolaters.</hi>

                  <p>Yet neither were their gods of so brutish and impure a nature, as the <hi>Pria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus, Cloacina,</hi> and <hi>Stercutia</hi> amongst the <hi>Romans</hi>; or as their <hi>Venus, Flora, Lupa,</hi> common Harlots.

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61668:30" rendition="simple:additions"/>
us, that they vvere not <hi>nomina Colendorum, sed crimina Colentium.</hi> Nor vvere they so immodest and obscene in their rites and ceremonies, as were the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> in the Sacrifices to their <hi>Cybele</hi> or <hi>Berecynthia,</hi> vvhom they call the <hi>mother of the gods</hi>; described by <hi>Arnobius, Lactantius,</hi> and others of the antient Writers, in such lively colours, as no chaste eye can look upon them without detestation.</p>

                  <p>Well may the <hi>Doctor</hi> run apace, drawing an <hi>empty Cart</hi> after him. What is all this to confute my position, that the <hi>unconverted Brittains, foul Idolaters, were in a sad condition</hi>? It seems he had a mind to tell the world of the foulest <hi>Idolls</hi> amongst the <hi>Romans</hi>; and, if so, let them thank him for his intelligence, who knew it not before.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Dr. <hi>Heylyn.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>And for the number of their gods, they fell extreamly short of that infinite multitude, which St. <hi>Augustine</hi> finds amongst the <hi>Romans,</hi> our Author naming onely three, (which he calls <hi>gods paramount</hi>) that is to say, BELINUS, AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DATE, and DIANA.</p>

                  <speaker>Fuller.</speaker>
                  <p>If they had onely <hi>three gods,</hi> they had <hi>two too many,</hi> However, it will appear, that <hi>these</hi> were onely (as the Author phraseth them) <hi>Paramount</hi>
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That they fell not (to use the Doctor's words) <hi>extreamly short</hi> (a virtuous <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream</hi>) of the <hi>Romans</hi> in their <hi>Idolatry,</hi> may thus be proved.
<q>
                        <p>They that had Idolls almost exceeding the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> in number, fell not much short of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the antient <hi>Brittains</hi> almost exceeded the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> in number of Idolls.</p>
                        <p>Therefore they fell not much short of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Major</hi> is plain in <hi>Scripture,</hi> often complaining of the <hi>Idols of Aegypt</hi>; as also in <hi>human Writers, Iuvenal</hi> jeering the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> for being <hi>over-stocked</hi> with such <hi>kind of cattle,</hi> whose gods (<hi>Leeks</hi> and <hi>Onyons</hi>) did commonly grow in their Gardens.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> are the very words of <hi>grave Gildas,</hi> the most <hi>antient Brittish</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (flourishing <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 580.) <hi>Portenta pene numero Aegyptiaca vincentia.</hi> Where, in few words, we have the <hi>Numerosity</hi> and <hi>Monstrosity</hi> of the <hi>Brittish Idols.

                  <p>When therefore <hi>Gildas</hi> telleth us of the <hi>antient Brittains,</hi> that in the number of their gods they had almost exceeded <hi>Aegypt,</hi> (<hi>Portenta pene numero Aegyptiaca vincentia,</hi> in that Author's language) it must be understood with reference to the Times in which he lived, when all the <hi>Roman</hi> Rabble had been thrust upon them, and not as speaking of the time of their first Conversion.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Animadvertor</hi> doth confesse, that the <hi>Brittans</hi> did worship <hi>Diana</hi>: But whether she was one of the latter brood of Idols, brought in by the <hi>Romans</hi> at their Conquest; or hatched long before amongst the <hi>Brittains,</hi> as their <hi>own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-goddess,</hi> is the Question. I am confident in the latter.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Brittish Stories</hi> tell us, that <hi>Brutus</hi> (some <hi>hundred</hi> of <hi>years</hi> before the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> arrived here) being upon his Sea-voyage to seek his fortune, repaired to the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Diana,</hi> in an <hi>Island</hi> called <hi>Largeria,</hi> and there addressing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to her Temple, was in a dream not onely instructed in the manner of her sacrifices, and rituall services; but also directed to an Island in the West, now <hi>Brittain,</hi> where his Posterity should fix themselves in happiness. And that this passeth for currant amongst the <hi>Welch,</hi> I report my self to their <hi>learned Gentry,</hi> the proper judges thereof.</p>
                  <p>Let me add this Passage from the Pen of as great an Antiquary, as any <hi>Wales</hi> now doth enjoy.
<q>As for the name of <hi>Diana,</hi> I do conceive that she was called <hi>Dain</hi> in our Language; and I have many Histories of our Nation, that seem to make no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of it. To this day in <hi>Wales, fatt marketable Cattle</hi> are called <hi>Guartheg Demol;</hi> that is to say, <hi>Diana's Cattle,</hi> or, <hi>Cattle fit to be sacrificed, &amp;c.</hi> And I am more then confident, there is no man living can put any other interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation upon this word <hi>Demol;</hi> it must be an Adjective of <hi>Dain,</hi> and <hi>Dain</hi> hath no other signification in our Language, then the name of <hi>Diana.</hi>

The <hi>Brittains,</hi> worshipping <hi>Apollo</hi> by the name of <hi>Belinus,</hi> as both <hi>Cambden</hi> and our <hi>Author</hi> say they did, <hi>must</hi> be supposed to have <hi>another name</hi> for <hi>Diana</hi> also, and were more likely to have called her by the name of <hi>Artemis,</hi> her old <hi>Grecian name,</hi> or by some other of as near a resemblance to it, as <hi>Belinus</hi> was to that of <hi>Bel</hi> in the <hi>Eastern Countries.</hi> Assuredly, if that great <hi>City</hi> had received its name from <hi>Diana's Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> the <hi>Welch</hi> being so <hi>tenacious</hi> of their <hi>antient Language,</hi> would have had some remembrance of it, who to this day call it <hi>Lundayn,</hi> and not LLAN-DIAN, according to the <hi>new conceit</hi> which our <hi>Author</hi> speaks of.

                  <p>Now to facilitate this great work of their <hi>Conversion, Cambden</hi> and <hi>Godwin,</hi> two great <hi>Antiquaries,</hi> have alledged one reason, which is not allowed of by our <hi>Author</hi>; and our <hi>Author</hi> hath alledged another reason, which none can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of but himself. The reason alledged by the two great <hi>Antiquaries,</hi> is, that the <hi>Druides did instruct the Brittains in the knowledge of One onely God,</hi> which que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stionlesse was a great <hi>step</hi> to their <hi>Conversion. Druides unum esse Deum semper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcârunt,</hi> saith our <hi>Author's Margin.</hi> But this he reckoneth a mistake, and thus charitably wisheth thereupon, viz.
<q>May their mistake herein be as freely forgiven them, as I hope and desire, that the charitable Reader will with his pardon meet those unvoluntary errors, which in this work by me shall be committed.</q>

                  <p>But whether those two learned Pens were <hi>mistaken</hi> or not, shall be now exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. I conceive clearly, that they were not <hi>mistaken</hi> in it, it being first improbable, if not impossible, that two Men of such Parts and Learning, and of such eminent integrity in all their Writings, should vent a Proposition, or position rather, which they have no ground for.</p>

                  <p>They were <hi>learned Pens</hi> indeed, as ever our Nation bred, in their kind of Studies; and great <hi>Antiquaries.</hi> But onely the * ANTIENT OF DAIES is <hi>Omniscient</hi> and <hi>Infallible.</hi> And I am confident, such was their <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> that they would rather be thankfull to, than angry with any, who, with due respect to their <hi>persons,</hi> should discover their <hi>mistakes.</hi> Amongst which, this was one, that the DRUIDES <hi>instructed the Brittains in the knowledge of one God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The contrary doth plainly appear by the <hi>testimony</hi> of <hi>Gildas,</hi> lately alledged, whose words are so walled about (as I may say) on both sides, by what went
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:61668:32" rendition="simple:additions"/>
before, and after that, as they cannot be evaded, they cannot be perverted to other reference, than relating unto the Religion of the <hi>antient Brittains,</hi> long before the entrance of the <hi>Romans</hi> into this <hi>Island</hi>; who, besides a <hi>numerous rabblement</hi> of <hi>portentous Idolls,</hi> gave <hi>divine honour</hi> to <hi>Mountains, Hills,</hi> and <hi>Rivers.</hi> Nothing can be more diametrically opposite to the <hi>worship</hi> of <hi>One God,</hi> than such <hi>gross</hi> and <hi>generally diffused Polytheism.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Add to the authority of <hi>Gildas</hi> that of <hi>Origen,</hi> thus writing in his <hi>fourth Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily</hi> on <hi>Ezekiel.</hi>

                  <p>All judicious Readers easily understand this Interrogation, [<hi>When did the Land of</hi> Brittain, <hi>before the comming of Christ, consent in the Religion of one God</hi>?] I say, all do understand, that this his question asked, and left unanswered, amoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth unto a very strong Negation; and, that before the comming of Christ, <hi>Brittain</hi> was divided into the worshipping of many gods.</p>

                  <p>And secondly our Author tells of the <hi>Druides,</hi> that they were <hi>Philosophers, Divines,</hi> and <hi>Lawyers,</hi> to the rest of the <hi>Brittains</hi>; and if Philosophers, they might by their long study in the book of Nature, and their Industrious inquiry into naturall Causes, attaine unto the knowledge of that one and onely Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Cause, (as others of the <hi>Heathen Philosophers</hi> in their severall Countries,) from which the works of Nature had their first Originall. And of some other the old <hi>Philosophers,</hi> it is said expresly by <hi>Minutius,</hi> that they had spoken so divinely of the things of God; <hi>ut quivis arbitretur aut nunc Christianos Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos esse, aut Philosophos fuisse jam tunc Christianos.</hi> So little was the difference in that particular, between these old <hi>Philosophers</hi> and the <hi>Primitive Christians.</hi> For though they did admit a multitude of Inferiour Gods, <hi>Topical</hi> in respect of Countries, and <hi>Tutelar</hi> in respect of particular Persons; yet in the middle of that darknesse they discerned one Supreme God over all the rest, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, as the <hi>Grecians; Hominum Sator atque Deorum,</hi> as the <hi>Latines</hi> call him. And though they were mistaken in the name of that Supream Power, whom generally they entituled by the name of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> yet they did well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough agree in giving him the Supream Power over all the world. <hi>Et qui Iovem principem volunt falluntur in nomine, sed de ea potestate consentiunt,</hi> as my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hath it. Nor did those old Philosophers keep the great truth unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, like a Candle in a dark-Lanthorn, or <hi>hid under a bushell</hi>; but plac'd it like a great Light on the top of a Mountain, that all the people might discern it; who thereupon lifting their hands unto the Heavens, did frequently make their addresses but to one God onely, saying in common SPEECH unto one another, that <hi>God was great,</hi> and <hi>God was true,</hi> and, <hi>If God permit.</hi> Of which, my Author (the same Christian Advocate) seems to make a question; <hi>Vulgi iste na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalis sermo est, an Christiani confitentis oratio?</hi> that is to say, Whether these expressions favoured not rather of the <hi>Christian,</hi> than the vulgar <hi>Heathen.</hi> And hereupon I may conclude in the behalf of the Druides, (or rather of those lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Pens who affirm it of them) that being <hi>Philosophers</hi> in <hi>Study,</hi> and <hi>Divines</hi> by <hi>Office,</hi> and very eminent in their times in both capacities, they might as well instruct the People in the knowledge of one onely God, as any other of the <hi>Heathen Sages,</hi> either <hi>Greeks</hi> or <hi>Romans.</hi> The reason alledged by these great <hi>Antiquaries</hi> being thus made good, we next proceed to the examination of that which is produced by our Author.</p>

                  <p>In this long <hi>Harangue,</hi> I know not what the <hi>Animadvertor aimes at</hi>; this I know, he <hi>hits not</hi> me, nor alledgeth any thing in opposition to what I have

written. If he desireth onely to prove, that the <hi>refined Heathens</hi> worshipped one God above all the rest, he shall not onely have my free consent, but the adjection of this my <hi>Symbole</hi> thereunto.</p>
                  <p>I conceive, that the Pagans adored the <hi>Essence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> under the name of <hi>Iupiter</hi>: and his Attributes under other Titles; <hi>Wisdom,</hi> of <hi>Apollo; Omni-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, Swiftnes</hi> of <hi>Mercury; Power,</hi> of <hi>Mars; Beauty,</hi> of <hi>Venus; Providence</hi> over the <hi>Sea, Neptune; Winds, Aeolus; Catile, Pan, &amp;c.</hi> Yet can I not see, how this can excuse them from being foul Idolaters, seeing the morall Commandement doth not say, <hi>Thou shalt not have other gods in equall degree of worship with me</hi>; but, <note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 20.3.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou shalt not have other gods before me:</hi> and the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> knoweth well, that the Originall importeth, <hi>Coram me,</hi> that is, <hi>Thou shalt have none other in my sight or presence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now for quietnesse sake, let the result of this long discourse (so far as I can understand) be granted him, and it amounts to no more, then to put the <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi> in the same form with the <hi>Grecians</hi>; instructed by their <hi>Druids</hi> in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of one God, as well and as far as the <hi>Grecians</hi> were in the same Lesson by their <hi>Philosophers.</hi> Now what the <hi>Grecians</hi> held and did in this point, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the practise of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> whose City was the <hi>Mistris</hi> of <hi>Greece, Staple</hi> of <hi>Learning,</hi> and <hi>Palace</hi> of <hi>Philosophers</hi>; and how well the <hi>Athenians</hi> worshipped one God, we have from the infallible witness of St. <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 17.16.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul, whose spirit was stirred within him, whilst he saw the City wholly given to idolatry.</hi> Whence it will follow, that the <hi>Brittaines, form-fellowes</hi> with the <hi>Grecians,</hi> were wholly given to Idolatry: which is as much, and more then I said before.</p>

                  <p>So that this fear being overblown, we will consider somewhat further of St. <hi>Peters</hi> first Preaching in this Island, not as deliver'd by Tradition from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is suspected to have pleaded their own Interest in it; but as affirmed positively by the <hi>Greek</hi> Menologies, and in the works of <hi>Simeon Metaphrastes</hi> an approved <hi>Greek</hi> Author. Of the Menologies (though vouched by <hi>Camden</hi> to this purpose) our Author takes no notice at all, but lets the weight of his displeasure fall on <hi>Metaphrastes.</hi>

For notwithstanding that this Tradition be as generall, as universally received, as almost any other in the Christian Church; yet our Author, being resolved to let fly at all, declares it for a piece of <hi>Novel super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, disguis'd with pretended Antiquity.</hi> Better provided (as it seems) to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute this point than the Ambassadours of <hi>Castile,</hi> when they contended for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency with those of <hi>England</hi> in the Council of <hi>Basil</hi>; who had not any thing to object against this Tradition of <hi>Iosephs</hi> preaching to the <hi>Brittains,</hi> although the <hi>English</hi> had provoked them, by confuting their absurd pretences for St. <hi>Iames</hi> his preaching to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>

                  <p>For first, our Author doth object in the way of scorn, that, fol. 6. <hi>The relation is as ill accoutred with tacklings, as the Ship, in which it is affirmed that St.</hi> Phillip, <hi>St.</hi> Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph, <hi>and the rest, were put by the Iews, into a Vessell without Sails or Oars, with intent to drown them; and being tossed with tempests in the midland Sea, at last safely landed at</hi> Marcelles <hi>in</hi> France, <hi>and thence afterwards made for</hi> England.] No such strange piece of <hi>Errantry</hi> (if we mark it well) as to render the whole <hi>truth</hi> suspected.</p>

                  <p>For first, we find it in the Monuments of elder times, that <hi>Acrisius</hi> King of <hi>Argos</hi> exposed his <hi>daughter Danae,</hi> with her young son <hi>Perseus,</hi> in such a vessell as this was, and as ill provided of all necessaries, to the open Seas; who, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,

And what if <hi>Danae</hi> (the self-same forsooth which had a golden shoure rained into her lap) crossed from <hi>Argos</hi> in <hi>Peloponesus,</hi> to <hi>Apulia,</hi> now <hi>Puglia,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in a streight line, and the narrowest part of the <hi>Adriatick.</hi> This doth not parallel the improbability of <hi>Ioseph</hi> his voyage, in an un-accoutred Ship, from some <hi>Port</hi> in <hi>Palestine,</hi> to <hi>Marselles,</hi> the way being <hi>ten times</hi> as far, full of <hi>flexures,</hi> and <hi>making of severall points</hi>; which costs our Sea-men some months in sailing, (though better accommodated).

                  <p>Our Author objecteth in the next place, that no <hi>writer of credit can be produced before the Conquest, who mentioneth</hi> Joseph<hi>'s comming hither.</hi>] For answer where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, it may first be said, that where there is a constant uncontrolled Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is most commonly the less care taken to commit it to Writing.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, that the Charters of <hi>Glassenbury,</hi> relating from the <hi>Norman</hi> to the <hi>Sax<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And thirdly, that <hi>Frier Bale,</hi> as great an enemy to the unwarrantable Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> as our Author can desire to have him, hath vouch'd two witnesses hereunto, that is to say, <hi>Melkinus Avalonius,</hi> and <hi>Gildas Albanus</hi>; whose Writings, or some fragments of them, he may be believed to have seen, though our Author hath not.</p>

                  <p>Nor the Animadvertor neither. <hi>Bale</hi> doth not intimate that he ever saw any part of them; and he useth to <hi>Cackle,</hi> when lighting on such Eggs.

                  <p>This is the Sum and Substance of the Story of K. <hi>Lucius,</hi> which the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madvertor hath breviated, and with whom I concurre therein. It never came into my thoughts to doubt the <hi>substance,</hi> but deny some circumstances thereof. My owne <note place="margin">Church Hist. v. 1. pag. 10.</note> expression is, that the whole Bulk thereof is not to be <hi>Refused,</hi> but <hi>Refined,</hi> and to this I adhere.</p>

                  <p>And in the summing up of this story, our Author having refuted some petit Arguments which had been answered to his hand (though much mistaken by the way in taking <hi>Diotarus</hi> King of <hi>Galatia,</hi> for a King of <hi>Sicilie,</hi> fol. 10.) gives us some other in their stead, which he thinks unanswerable.</p>

                  <p>I deny not that P. <hi>Eleutherius</hi> might or did send a Letter to K. <hi>Lucius,</hi> but I justly suspect the Letter novv extant to be but-pretended and forged. I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought (by the vvay, hovv came the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> to knovv my thoughts,) my Arguments <hi>unanswerable,</hi> but now I say they are <hi>unanswered</hi>; standing in full force, notvvithstanding any alledged by the Animadvertor to the contrary. I confesse a <hi>Memory-mistake</hi> of <hi>Sicilia</hi> for <hi>Galatia</hi>: and as it is the first fault he hath detected in my Book; so shall it be the first by me (God Willing) amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the next Edition.</p>

                  <p>Our Author First objects against the Popes answer to the King, that</p>
                  <p>Fol. 11. <hi>It relates to a former letter of King</hi> Lucius <hi>wherein he requested of the</hi> Pope <hi>to send him a Copy or Collection of the</hi> Roman <hi>Lawes, which being at that time in force in the Ile of</hi> Britain, <hi>was but</hi> actum agere.] But certainly though those parts of <hi>Brittain</hi> in which <hi>Lucius</hi> reign'd, were governed in part (and but in part) by the Lawes of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet were the Lawes of <hi>Rome,</hi> at that time more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and of a far more generall practice, then to be limited to so narrow a part of their Dominions. Two thousand Volumes we find of them in <hi>Iustinians</hi> time, out of which, by the help of <hi>Theophilus, Trebonianus,</hi> and many other lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men of that noble faculty, the Emperour compos'd that Book or body of Law which from the universality of its comprehension, we still call the <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dects.</hi>

                  <p>In the next place it is objected, that</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>This letter mounts King</hi> Lucius <hi>to too high a Throne, making him the Monarch or King of</hi> Britain, <hi>who neither was the Supreme nor sole King here, but partial and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to the</hi> Romans.] This we acknowledge to be true, but no way preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to the cause in hand. <hi>Lucius</hi> both was and might be call'd the King of <hi>Britain,</hi> though Tributary and Vassal to the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, as the two <hi>Baliols Iohn</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi> were both Kings of <hi>Scotland,</hi> though Homagers and Vassals to <hi>Edward</hi> the first, and third, of <hi>England,</hi> the Kings of <hi>Naples</hi> to the <hi>Pope,</hi> and those of <hi>Austria</hi> and <hi>Bohemia</hi> to the <hi>German</hi> Emperors.</p>

                  <p>A <hi>Blank</hi> is better then such <hi>writing to no purpose.</hi> For first, both the <hi>Baliols</hi> in their severall times were (though not SUPREME) SOLE <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi> So
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61668:37"/>
were the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Naples,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Austria,</hi> (there never being but <hi>one,</hi> the first, and Last, viz. <note n="*" place="margin">Seb. Munste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus de Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</note> 
                     <hi>Fredoritus Leopoldus</hi>) and the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Bohemia</hi> in their respective <hi>Dominions.</hi> Not so <hi>Lucius,</hi> who was neither <hi>Supreme</hi> nor <hi>Sole King</hi> of <hi>Brittain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Besides the <hi>Baliols</hi> being <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> did never Style themselves, (or were Styled by other) <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Brittaine.</hi> The <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Naples</hi> never entituled themselves <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Italy</hi>: Nor the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> and <hi>Bohemia</hi> ever wrote themselves, (or were written to,) as <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas <hi>Lucius,</hi> (<hi>Ruler</hi> onely in the <hi>South West-part</hi> of this <hi>Isle,</hi>) is in this Letter made <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Brittain,</hi> more then came to his share; an Argument that the <hi>Forger</hi> thereof was unacquainted with the <hi>Constitution</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom.</hi> And this just Exception stands firme against the <hi>Letter,</hi> what ever the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> hath alledged in the excuse thereof.</p>

                     <hi>The Scripture quoted in that Letter is out of St.</hi> Hieroms <hi>Translation, which came more then a hundred years after</hi>:] Unless it can be prov'd withall (as I think it cannot) that <hi>Hierom</hi> followed not, in those Texts, those old Translations, which were before receiv'd and used in the Western Churches.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>That this letter not appearing till a thousand years after the death of</hi> Pope <hi>Eleuthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, might probably creep out of some Monks Cell, some four hundred years since.</hi>] Which allegation being admitted, (the Monks Cell excepted,) it makes no more to the discredit of the letter which we have before us, then to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing of those excellent Monuments of Piety and Learning, which have been recovered of late times from the dust and moths of ancient Libraries. Such Treasures like money long lock't up, is never thought lesse profitable when it comes abroad. And from what place soever it first came abroad, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it came not out of any Monks Cell; that generation being then wholly at the Popes devotion, by consequence not likely to divulge an Evidence, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly tending to the overthrow of his pretensions. The Popes <hi>about four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years since</hi> were mounted to the height of that power and Tyranny which they claimed as Vicars unto Christ. To which there could not any thing be more plainly contrary then that passage in the Pope's letter, whereto he tells the King, <hi>That he was Gods Vicar in his owne Kingdom</hi> (vos estis Vicarius Dei in Regno vestro, as the Latin hath it.) Too great a secret to proceed <hi>from the Cell of a Monk,</hi> who would have rather forg'd ten Decretals to uphold the Popish usurpations over Soveraign Princes, then published one onely (whether true or false) to subvert the same. Nor doth this Letter onely give the King an empty Title, but such a Title as imports the exercise of the chief Ecclesiastical Power within his Dominions. For thus it followeth in the same; <hi>The people and the folk of the Realm of</hi> Britain <hi>be yours, whom if they be divided, ye ought to gather in concord and peace, to call them to the</hi> faith <hi>and</hi> law <hi>of Christ, to cherish and maintain them, to rule and govern them, so as you may reign everlastingly with him whose</hi> Vicar <hi>you are.</hi> So far the very words of the letter, as our Author rendereth them, which savour far more of the honest simplicity of the Primitive <hi>Popes,</hi> then the impostures and supposititious issues of the latter times.</p>

                  <p>I confesse some pretious pieces of <hi>Antiquity,</hi> long <hi>Latent</hi> in <hi>Obscurity,</hi> have at last broke forth into the <hi>Light,</hi> with no little <hi>advantage</hi> to <hi>Learning.</hi> But then such were <hi>intire Books,</hi> and we know, how, when, where, and by whom, they were found out, and brought forth. Whereas this <hi>loose Letter</hi> secretly and slily slid into the <hi>World,</hi> unattended with any such <hi>Cicumstances</hi> to attest the <hi>Genuinesse</hi> thereof. Children casually lost, are no whit the <hi>lesse Legitimate</hi>; and <hi>beloved</hi> the more, when found and owned of their <hi>Parents.</hi> But give me leave to suspect that <hi>Babe</hi> a <hi>Bastard,</hi> which is left on a <hi>bulk,</hi> or under a <hi>Stall</hi>; no <hi>Father</hi> being found, or <hi>Mother,</hi> to maintaine it. A <hi>Presumption</hi> that this <hi>Letter</hi> of <hi>Elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therius</hi> is <hi>supposititious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I confesse, this pretended Letter of <hi>Lucius</hi> hath something in it, which doth <hi>act and personate primitive simplicity,</hi> (as that passage of Regal power in Church-matters,) but more which doth <hi>practise the Monkish ignorance,</hi> of later times. There were lately false twenty Shilling pieces, (commonly called <hi>Morgans</hi>) coyned by a cunning and cheating Chymist, whose part without the <hi>Rind</hi> was <hi>good Gold,</hi> and would endure the touch, whilst that within was base as but <hi>double guilded Brasse.</hi> Such, this Letter of <hi>Lucius</hi>; some part whereof will endure the <hi>Test,</hi> the other not: the Monk, who made it, pretending something of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, (so to palliate the deceit); but having more of the Novelty of the middle age. He lived in some six hundred years since.</p>
                  <p>May the Reader be pleased to take notice, that the Animadvertor hath silently passed by, the strongest Argument to shatter the credit of this Letter alledged by me, and taken from a phrase unknown in that Age, yet used in the <hi>Letter,</hi> even MANU TENERE, to <hi>Maintain,</hi> or defend. This the Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor slips over in silence, and that I believe for <hi>nineteen reasons,</hi> whereof this was one, because He himselfe was unable to answer it, and knew <hi>Criticks</hi> would laugh at him, if affirming those words, in that sense, contemporary with Pope <hi>Eleutherius.</hi> Herein, He appears like a <hi>Dunkerker,</hi> who delights to prey on poore Marchants Ships passing on in their Calling, but meeting an <hi>English Man of War,</hi> He can <hi>look Big,</hi> and fairly <hi>give him the goe-By.</hi> He finds it more facile to <hi>carpe</hi> an easie inoffensive passage, then to <hi>confute</hi> what hath difficulty, and strength of reason therein.</p>
                  <p>I resume what I <hi>said</hi> before, and what the Animadvertor hath <hi>gain-said</hi> to no purpose, <hi>viz.</hi> that this Story of K. <hi>Lucius</hi> is not to be <hi>Refused</hi> but <hi>Refined,</hi> and the <hi>drosse</hi> is to be put from the good <hi>Metall</hi>; or (as my own words also are,) the good Corn therein sifted from the <hi>Chaffe</hi>; and, amongst the <hi>Chaffe,</hi> I have cast away this <hi>Letter.</hi> But if the Animadvertor <hi>loves</hi> to eat both <hi>Corn</hi> and <hi>Chaffe,</hi> much good may his Diet do him, and let Him and Horse feed on their Loafe together.</p>

                  <p>I enter'd on this story <hi>with this much aversenesse,</hi> as finding much difficulty, and fearing not to give satisfaction therein to my self, and others.</p>

                  </p>

                  <p>And first though <hi>Ieffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> seem to deserve no credit in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, where he speaks against our Author's sense; yet in another place where he comes up to his Desires, he is otherwise thought of, and therefore made the Fore-man of the Grand-inquest against <hi>Augustine</hi> the Monk, whom he enditeth for the Murther of the Monks of <hi>Bangor.</hi> And certainly, if <hi>Ieffery</hi> may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved when he speaks in Passion, <hi>when his Welch-Blood was up,</hi> as our Author words it, as one that was <hi>concerned in the Cause of his Country-Men</hi>; he may more easily be believed in a Cause of so remote Antiquity, where neither Love nor Hatred, or any other prevalent Affection had any power or reason to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him from the Way of Truth.</p>

                  <p>It is usuall with all <hi>Authors,</hi> sometimes to <hi>close</hi> with the <hi>Iudgments</hi> of the same <hi>Person,</hi> from whom they afterwards on just Cause may <hi>dissent</hi>; and should not this Liberty be allowed me, to like or leave, in <hi>Ieffery Monmouth,</hi> what I think fitting? The <hi>Animadvertor</hi> concurreth with <hi>Bishop God-win,</hi> that the DRUIDES <hi>instructed the Britons in the worship of one God</hi>; yet will not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with his <hi>Iudgement,</hi> when averring the <hi>Letter fathered on Eleutherius</hi> not to savour of the Style of that Age. Yea, when I make for him, he can alledge twenty Lines together, out of my Book, against <hi>H. le Strange</hi>; though at other times, when he hath served his Turne of me, I am the Object of his sleighting and Contempt.</p>
                  <p>Now when as the IN-ANIMADVERTOR (for now I must so call him for his <hi>Carelesnesse,</hi>) citeth a place in my Book, <hi>viz.</hi> [<hi>Lib.</hi> 2. Fol. 63.] that I make J. <hi>Monmouth</hi> the <hi>Foreman</hi> of the great <hi>inquest</hi> against <hi>Augustine</hi> the <hi>Monk,</hi> he is much mistaken therein. For in the place by him cited, I <hi>Impannell</hi> a <hi>Grand Iury,</hi> (amongst whom J. <hi>Monmouth</hi> is neither <hi>Fore-man,</hi> nor <hi>any Man</hi>) of <hi>Iudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Readers</hi> consisting of twenty four. As false is it what he addeth, as if in that Triall I attributed much to the judgment of J. <hi>Monmouth,</hi> who therein is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produced as a <hi>Witnesse,</hi> and a <hi>Verdict</hi> brought in, <hi>point-Blank</hi> against his Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, <hi>acquitting Augustine</hi> the <hi>Monk</hi> of the <hi>Murther,</hi> whereof <hi>Monmouth</hi> did <hi>accuse</hi> him.</p>

                  <p>And secondly, though <hi>Ieffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> be a Writer of no great credit with me, when he stands single by himselfe; yet when I find him seconded and confirmed by others, I shall not brand a truth by the name of falshood, because he reports it. Now that in <hi>Brittain</hi> at that time there were no fewer then eight and twenty Cities, is affirmed by <hi>Beda. Henry</hi> of <hi>Huntington</hi> not only agrees with him in the number, but gives us also the names of them, though where to find many of them it is hard to say. That in each of these Cities was some Temple dedicated to the Pagan Gods, that those Temples afterwards were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd to the use of Christians, and the Revenues of them assign'd over to the maintenance of the Bishops and other Ministers of the Gospel, hath the concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent testimony of approved Authors; that is to say, <hi>Matthew</hi> of <hi>Westminster</hi> out of <hi>Gildas,</hi> Anno 187. <hi>Rodolph de Diceto,</hi> cited by the learned Primat of <hi>Armach</hi> in
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61668:39"/>
his Book <hi>De Primordiis Eccles. Brit.</hi> cap. 4. <hi>Gervase</hi> of <hi>Tilbury,</hi> ibid. cap. 6. And for the <hi>Flamines,</hi> and <hi>Arch-flamines,</hi> they stand not onely on the credit of <hi>Ieffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> but of all our owne Writers, who speak of the foundation of the antient Bishopricks, even to <hi>Polydor Virgil.</hi>

                  <p>I concurre with the Animadvertor in the number of the Citties in Brittain.</p>
                  <p>Also I do not deny but that K. <hi>Lucius</hi> might place Bishops in <hi>some</hi> (perchance <hi>half</hi>) of them, which I believe is all which the Animadvertor doth desire. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Arch-bishops</hi> exactly substituted in the <hi>Individual places</hi> of <hi>Flamens</hi> and <hi>Arch-flamens,</hi> my <hi>beliefe</hi> cannot come up to the height thereof. I find that <hi>Giraldus Cambrensis</hi> and other Authors of that age, (though concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with J. <hi>Monmouth</hi> in <hi>Lucius</hi> his <hi>Episcopating</hi> of Citties,) make not any mention of these <hi>Arch-flamens.</hi>

                  <p>Nor want there many forrain Writers who affirm the same, beginning with <hi>Martinus Polonus,</hi> who being esteemed no friend to the Popedom (because of the Story of <hi>Pope Ione</hi> which occurs in his Writings) may the rather be believ'd in the story of <hi>Lucius.</hi> And he agrees with <hi>Ieffery</hi> of <hi>Monmouth</hi> in all parts of the story, as to the <hi>Flamines</hi> and <hi>Arch-flamines,</hi> as do also many other of the <hi>Roman</hi> Writers which came after him.</p>

                  <p>Nothing more usuall then for forrain Writers, with <hi>implicite faith,</hi> to take things on the credit of such who have wrote the History of their own Country.

                  <p>But where both our Author and some others have rais'd some objections against this part of the <hi>History,</hi> for Answer thereunto I refer the Reader to the learned and laborious Work of <hi>Francis Mason</hi> late Archdeacon of <hi>Norfolk, De Ministerio Anglicano,</hi> the sum whereof in brief is this, <hi>Licet in una urbe multi Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines,</hi> that though there were many <hi>Flamines</hi> in one City, yet was there onely one which was called <hi>Pontifex</hi> or <hi>Primus Flaminum</hi>; the Pope or principall of the <hi>Flamines</hi>; of which kind one for every City, were those whom our Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans speak of. And for the <hi>Archi-Flamines</hi> or <hi>Proto-Flamines,</hi> though the name occurre not in old <hi>Roman</hi> Writers, yet were there some in power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity above the rest, who were entituled <hi>Primi Pontificum</hi> (as indeed <hi>Coifi</hi> by that name is called in <hi>Beda</hi>) which is the same in sense with <hi>Arch-flamines</hi> although not in sound. All I shall further add is this, that if these 28 Cities were not all furnished with Bishops in the time of <hi>Lucius,</hi> for vvhom it vvas impossible to spread his armes and expresse his power over all the South parts of the Island; yet may the honour of the vvork be ascribed to him, because begun by his encouragement, and perfected by his example; as <hi>Romulus</hi> is generally esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Founder of <hi>Rome,</hi> although the least part of that great City vvas of his Foundation.</p>

our Author unto that of <hi>Amphibalus,</hi> in prosecution whereof he telleth us of a great slaughter of <hi>Christians</hi> in or near the City of <hi>Litchfield,</hi> from thence so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated, of vvhich thus saith he;</p>
                  <p>Fol. 19. <hi>This relation is favoured by the name of</hi> Litchfield, <hi>which in the</hi> British <hi>tongue signifies a</hi> Golgotha, <hi>or a place bestrewed with skuls.</hi>] It's true indeed that <hi>Litchfield,</hi> or <hi>Licidfield,</hi> as <hi>Bedae</hi> calleth it, is made by <hi>Iohn Rosse</hi> to signifie <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daverum Campus,</hi> or the field of dead bodies. But that it doth so signifie in the <hi>British</hi> language, I do more then doubt, the termination of the vvord be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meerly <hi>Saxon,</hi> as in <hi>Hefensield, Cock-field, Camps-field,</hi> and many others. As little am I satisfied in the <hi>Etymon</hi> of the name of <hi>Maiden-head,</hi> which he ascribes unto the worshipping of the head of one of those many Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens vvhich vvere martyred with <hi>Ursula</hi> at <hi>Colen,</hi> fol. 36. For vvhich though he cite <hi>Camden</hi> for his Author (following therein, but not approving the old Tradition) yet vvhen I find in the same <hi>Camden,</hi> that this Town was formerly called <hi>Maiden-hith,</hi> that anciently there vvas a ferry near the place vvhere the Town now stands, and that <hi>Hith</hi> in the old <hi>Saxon</hi> tongue, did signifie a Wharf, Haven, or landing place, I have some reason to believe, that the Town took this name from the Wharf or Ferry belonging at that time to some neighbouring <hi>Nunnery,</hi> or to some private Maidens dwelling thereabout, vvho then received the profits of it. Just so, <hi>Queen-Hith</hi> in <hi>London</hi> took that appellation, because the profits of that Wharf vvere antiently accompted for, to the Queens of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; and <hi>Maiden-bradly</hi> in <hi>Wilshire,</hi> vvas so denominated because belonging to one of the inheretrices of <hi>Manasses Basset,</hi> a most noble personage in his time, who founded a House here for <hi>Maiden Lepers.</hi>

                  <p>And this is the reason that disapproveth the probability of <hi>Cern-el,</hi> because Hebrew and Latine never incorporated together, Greek, as I may say, being interposed betwixt them.</p>
                  <p>But such Conjunctions of two Languages, vvhich, in some sort, indented one another, are frequent and familiar.</p>
                  <p>Our Author lately presented us vvith two half-Greek, half-Latine Archi-flamens, and Proto-flamens.</p>

                     <hi>As touching the Elymology of the City of</hi> Litchfield, <hi>I can give you no satisfactory accompt; being not well skill'd in the Saxon Tongue.

A Bishoprick and a Bishop of <hi>York</hi> we find on good Record within few years after; <hi>Eborius</hi> the Bishop of that City subscribing to the Councill of <hi>Arles</hi> in the time of <hi>Constantine,</hi> the Son and next successor of <hi>Constantius Chlorus.</hi> And that he was a Prince of surpassing virtue, is generally agreed upon by all Historians, both <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Christians.</hi> The Question then will be onely this, Whether he did <hi>surpass</hi> also in <hi>Christian piety,</hi> which our Author will not otherwise grant, but by our Saviours Argument onely, concluding <hi>those to be on our part who are not against us</hi>; Constantius <hi>doing no other good unto</hi> Christianity, <hi>but that he did not do it harm.</hi> A censure not agreeable to so good an Emperour, who though he were no <hi>through-paced Christian,</hi> yet did he both favour their Religion, and protect their persons, as <hi>Eusebius</hi> testifies <hi>de vita Constantini, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. And not so onely, but as our Author himselfe confesseth, he <hi>both permitted and preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them who would rebuild the decayed Christian Churches.</hi> If to preserve the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of Christians in the exercise of their Religion, to have them near unto him in places of greatest trust and eminence, to suffer them to rebuild their Churches and defend them in it, be not the <hi>doing of some good unto Christianity,</hi> more then the <hi>doing it no harm,</hi> let our Author carry it, and <hi>Cambden</hi> bear the blame of his needlesse Courtship.</p>

                  <p>If at the end of this <hi>long Note, the Animadvertor</hi> at Last had demonstrated that <hi>Constantius Chlorus</hi> was a <hi>thorow-paced</hi> Christian; the Reader, and I my selfe, would not have grudged our attention unto it.</p>
                  <p>But what is the <hi>Total sum</hi> of what he saith? It amounts to just nothing, only to show that (which I confessed) he did some <hi>good</hi> (besides no <hi>hurt</hi>) to Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. What is this to prove the words of Learned, (but here mistaken) Mr. <hi>Camden.</hi>
                     <q>An Emperour surpassing in all Virtues and Christian Piety.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Animadvertor should first have proved that this Constantius had <hi>passed</hi> into <hi>Christianity</hi> before he was <hi>surpassing therein</hi>; a thing which He, and all his Friends, are never able to evidence by any authentick Author.</p>
                  <p>In a word, As <hi>Chlorus</hi> or YELLOW (so his Name in Greek) is a <hi>Middle colour</hi> betwixt <hi>White</hi> and <hi>Black,</hi> below the former, and above the latter in <hi>Brightnesse</hi>; So this Emperour, (well answering his name,) was indeed much better than

                  <p>For making a general muster of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Gods, and shewing how they were dispos'd of in relation to the dayes of the week, he concludes it thus: Fol. 55. <hi>And thus we see the whole week bescattered with</hi> Saxon <hi>Idols, whose Pagan gods were the God-fathers of the dayes, and gave them their names.</hi>] Not the <hi>whole week,</hi> though the greatest part thereof was thus bescattered. <hi>Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> and <hi>Munday</hi> being so call'd in reference to the Sun and Moon, or else in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence to the names of <hi>Dies Solis</hi> and <hi>Dies Lunae,</hi> which they found given by the <hi>Romans</hi> at their entrance here.

by the ancient <hi>Saxons,</hi> and then might think themselves neglected in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no place assigned them amongst the rest; or else the <hi>Saxon Pagan Gods were not the Godfathers to all the dayes of the week,</hi> as our Author telleth us.</p>

                  <p>As much he seems to be mistaken in their god called <hi>Woden</hi>; of whom thus he telleth us. Fol. 54. Woden, <hi>that is wood, fierce, or furious, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the denomination to</hi> Wednesday,<note place="margin">

For certainly had the Saxons worshipped <hi>Wooden</hi> as the god of Battail, or <hi>correspondent to Mars,</hi> they would have given him the third day of the week, or the day of <hi>Mars,</hi> and not the fourth day of the week or the day of <hi>Mercury</hi>; as they gave <hi>Sunday</hi> and <hi>Munday</hi> unto <hi>Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna,</hi> and <hi>Thursday</hi> unto <hi>Thur,</hi> whom they worshipped in the place of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> ascribing unto him (as the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> did to <hi>Iupiter</hi>) the power of bearing rule in the Air, governing Thunder, Lightnings, Windes, Showers, fair weather, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as <hi>Adam Bremensis,</hi> a good Writer, doth inform us of them. And though it may be true, which our Author telleth us, that <hi>by his aid and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therance they hoped to obtain Victory,</hi> yet this entitleth him not to the place of <hi>Mars</hi>; as many victories being gotten by wit and stratagem (the known arts of <hi>Mercury</hi>) as by strength and valour.</p>

                  <p>In describing the <hi>Saxon Idolatries</hi> I followed <hi>Verstegan,</hi> as the best in this kind, as who (<hi>Data opera</hi>) had written on <hi>that subject,</hi> and who lately by the <note n="*" place="margin">In the last page.</note> Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertor was styled (and that very deservedly) <hi>a man inferiour to none in the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Nation.</hi>

                  <p>But from our Authors failers, in recounting the superstitions of our <hi>Saxon</hi> Ancestors, let us next see how he behaves himself in laying down the story of their conversion. In which, though he ascribe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing unto <hi>Austin</hi> the Monk, yet he will by no means allow him to be their Apostle: For, fol. 54. <hi>The</hi> Papists (saith he) <hi>commonly call</hi> Augustine <hi>the English Apostle, how</hi> properly <hi>we shall see hereafter.</hi> And after, fol. 68. <hi>The Papists brag that he was the Apostle of the English.</hi>] In these few words there are two things to be considered, whether he is called <hi>the Apostle of the English</hi> by the <hi>Papists</hi> onely; and secondly, whether he were not so, both in fact and title. Not call'd so by the <hi>Papists</hi> onely, I am sure of that; but called so commonly by as good Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants as our Author himself. Thus <hi>Camden,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Camd.

                        <hi>Id. in Worcest. fol.</hi> 578.</note> but in another place more plainly, as his own opinion. <hi>A place there is about this shire called</hi> Austins Oke, <hi>at which</hi> Augustine <hi>the</hi> Apostle <hi>of the</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish men, <hi>and the</hi> Bishops <hi>of</hi> Britain <hi>met,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Philemon Holland</hi> of <hi>Coventry,</hi> a good Protestant also, making an Index un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Camden,</hi> speaks the self same language; Augustine <hi>the Apostle of the</hi> English; which is short, but full. <hi>Gabriel Richardson</hi> of <hi>Brazen-Nose,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Richardsons State of Europe lib.</hi> 3.</note> an honest Protestant, in his laborious piece called the <hi>State of Europe,</hi> telleth us of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> that the <hi>Archbishops See was founded by King</hi> Ethelbert <hi>in the person of</hi> St. Austin <hi>the Apostle of the</hi> English. More of this kind might be produc'd, were it not given us for a Rule in the holy Scripture, <hi>Ex ore duorum testium vel trium,</hi> that two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses were sufficient to confirm a truth.</p>
                  <p>The next thing here to be considered is, whether <hi>Austin</hi> were not the Apostle of the <hi>English,</hi> both in fact and title. In order whereunto, we must first take notice, that the word being meerly <hi>Greek,</hi> doth signifie in its natural and original sence a <hi>Messenger,</hi> a <hi>Legat,</hi> an <hi>Embassador,</hi> from whom, to whomsoever sent; and though appropriated to twelve as by way of excellence, yet not improperly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated unto others in succeeding times, with reference to the Nations whom they had converted. So <hi>Boniface</hi> an <hi>English</hi> man the first Archbishop of <hi>Ments,</hi> is called by Dr. <hi>Holland,</hi> (as by many others) the Apostle of <hi>Germany; Palladius</hi> styled by <hi>Camden,</hi>

                     <hi>the</hi> Apostle <hi>of the</hi> Scottish <hi>Nation</hi>; and the <hi>Irish</hi> would not think themselves to be fairly dealt with, if their St. <hi>Patrick</hi> should not be honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with that Title also. In this sence <hi>Austin</hi> may be call'd, and that not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, the Apostle of the <hi>English</hi> Nation; though a <hi>derivative Apostle,</hi> an <hi>Apostle</hi> (as our Author calls him in the way of scorn, <hi>fol.</hi> 68.) <hi>at the second hand,</hi> though others propagated the Gospel further than he liv'd to doe. It was enough to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title him to this <hi>Apostleship,</hi> that be first publiquely preacht the Gospel, and brought the glad Tiding of Salvation amongst the <hi>English,</hi> though he neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted all the Nation, nor travelled into all parts of the Land to attempt the same. Neither <hi>St. Paul</hi> could be entitled the Apostle of the <hi>Gentiles, St. Thomas</hi> of the <hi>Indians,</hi> nor <hi>St. Matthew</hi> of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi>; if it were necessarily required to their Apostleships, that all the Nations of the <hi>Indians</hi> must be converted by the one, or the vast Countries of the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> must be converted by the other; of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, if <hi>St. Paul,</hi> to save them a labour, must have reduced all the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to the

faith of <hi>Christ.</hi> And this the Embassadors for the King of <hi>England</hi> at the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Basil,</hi> understood right well, when they contended for precedency with those of <hi>Castile.</hi> For when the <hi>Castilians</hi> had objected, that although <hi>Ioseph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> had preacht in <hi>England,</hi> it was but in a corner thereof, the grand bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Britain</hi> remaining <hi>Pagan</hi> many hundred years after: the <hi>English</hi> Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sadors wisely answered, that the Allegation was impertinent to the present pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, it being not the Universality, but the first Preaching of the Christian Faith which gained the name of an Apostle; there being no Disciple (as they truly ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged it) that ever converted a Kingdome totally and entirely to Christianity, for which consult our very Author, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4.181.</p>

From hence he carries him to a conference with the <hi>British</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops in the Country of the <hi>Wiccians</hi> (now <hi>Worcestershire</hi>) then part of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Mercia, fol.</hi> 60.

And this considered as it ought, with reference to the distance of those several places to which our very Author brings him, gives him just title to that honour which our Author would so willingly deprive him of, when telling us how the Papists called him the <hi>English</hi> Apostle, he adds these words, <hi>how properly</hi> (so called) <hi>we shall see hereafter.</hi>

                  <p>And here I will tender the Reader another <hi>distinction of Apostles,</hi> submitting it to his judgement, They were either of <hi>God alone, Man alone, God and Man together.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of <hi>God alone,</hi>

                  <p>I have spent more time than I intended in defence of this Title, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think it seasonable to proceed from the Person to his Acts. Of which the first we meet with is, the fixing of the Archiepiscopal See at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> for which our Author, amongst many other Reasons, gives us this for one, <hi>viz. That</hi> London, <hi>by reason of the receipt thereof was likely to prove the residing place for the English Monarch, and it was probable that the Archiepiscopal dignity would there be eclipst, and outshined by the Regal Diadem.</hi>] But here I must needs ask our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, whether he thinks, that this was really one of those many motives which occasioned <hi>Austin</hi> to resolve of <hi>Canterbury</hi> for his Seat of Residence? If yea, then must our Author grant him to be endued with the Spirit of Prophesie, which I think he will not; if not, then a contingency so remote could not be taken by him into consideration, as indeed it was not. For first, <hi>London</hi> at that time, was the chief City of the Kingdome of <hi>East-sex,</hi> one of the weakest of the seven, and so not likely to prevail over all the rest. Secondly, if any of the greater Kingdomes of <hi>Mercia, West-sex,</hi> or <hi>Northumberland,</hi> should in fine prevail, it was not probable that the Conquerors would remove the Seat Royal from their own Dominions into any of the conquered Countries. And thirdly, though the Kings of the <hi>West-Saxons,</hi> who prevailed at last, and became Monarchs of the whole, settled the Royal Seat in <hi>London,</hi> yet was it not till <hi>Winchester,</hi> their own Regal City, was destroyed by fire, and made unable to receive them.</p>

                  <p>Other Reasons are alledged by me, why <hi>Austin</hi> chose <hi>Canterbury</hi> rather than <hi>London</hi> for his <hi>Archiepiscopal See.</hi> These Arguments <hi>Iuncta juvant,</hi> and will hold in the <hi>Sheaff,</hi> though a <hi>single Arrow</hi> should be broken, I mean, though this one Reason (alledged by me) were disproved.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Austin</hi> needed no <hi>propheticall Inspiration,</hi> whilst <hi>prudential prevision</hi> could suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently suggest unto him, that if ever the <hi>Saxon-Heptarchy</hi> terminated (which was most probable) in a <hi>Monarchy, London</hi> might be presumed the principal place of the Royal Residence, as most convenient for Trading, and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious for scituation: I say <hi>London,</hi> an <hi>Infant</hi> in the time of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> a <hi>Stripling</hi> in

                        <hi>Camden in Richmondshire, fol.</hi> 720.</note> who withall telleth us,
<q>That it was reputed very sacred amongst the ancient <hi>English,</hi> for that in it, when the <hi>English-Saxons</hi> first embraced Christianity, there were in one day baptized with festival joy by <hi>Paulinus</hi> the Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> above ten thousand Men besides Women and little Children.</q>
Of <hi>Austins</hi> baptizing in this River, not one word saith he. Neither doth <hi>Beda</hi> touch upon it, as certainly he would have done, had there been ground for it. And therefore if I may have leave to venture my opinion, I shall concur with the <hi>old fragment</hi> as to the name of the River, and yet not carry <hi>Austin</hi> out of <hi>Kent,</hi> &amp; much less into <hi>Richmondshire</hi> to perform that office.

                  <p>But this still doth more and more confirm me in my judgement, that <hi>Austin</hi> advanced never into <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> and that the conversion of the <hi>Northumbrians</hi> was the work of <hi>Paulinus</hi> and others.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Conference pag. 7.</note> and that it was affirmed by some of the Bishops, that the Crosse in Baptism was used in the time of <hi>Constantine</hi>; Dr. <hi>Reynolds,</hi> the most able man of the opposite party, who had before acknowledged it to have been in use in other cases, from the very times of the Apostles, had not one word to say against it. And to say truth, no man of modesty and learning, could have spoke against it, when it was proved so clearly by Dr. <hi>Andrews</hi> then <hi>Dean</hi> of <hi>Westminster</hi> out of <hi>Tertullian, Cyprian, Origen,</hi> (each of which died long time before <hi>Constantines</hi> birth) to have been used <hi>in immortali Lavacro,</hi> in that blessed Sacrament. That good old saying of <hi>Tertullian, Caro signetur, ut anima muniatur,</hi> may serve once for all. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when our Author telleth us in the following words, that <hi>in that age nothing was used with Baptism, but Baptism,</hi> it must be considered as a smack of that <hi>old leaven</hi> which more and more will <hi>sowre the lump</hi> of his whole discourse. We have already had a taste of it in the very first Book, we finde a continuance of it here, and we shall see more of it hereafter; our Author not being coy in shewing his good affections not onely to the persons of the <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> but their incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity; not to the men onely, but their Doctrines and Opinions also.

                  <p>It is strongly grounded on convincing arguments, as God willing shall soon appear.</p>
                  <p>The Animadvertors marvelling why I am no better studied in the nature and original of the Hebrew Tongue, who <hi>(as he saith) have travelled over the Holy-Land,</hi> moveth me more to admire, that he himself should be so utterly ignorant in the <hi>Brasilian, Mexican, Aethiopian, Persian, Indian,</hi> and <hi>Tartarian</hi> Tongues; but especially in the <hi>China</hi> language, one letter whereof he did never understand, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he hath written a general Geographie of the whole world.</p>

                  <p>Nor is it the opinion onely, that this <hi>Tongue</hi> was spoken universally before the Flood, and even in <hi>Paradise</hi> it self in the state of Innocency, but that it shall be spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Celestial <hi>Paradise,</hi> the language of the Saints in glory.</p>

the Heathen gods spake Greek in <hi>Heaven,</hi> being past sixtie years old, he began to learn the Greek, that after death he might the better converse with them; a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and practise proportionable enough to Pagan principles: The <hi>analogy</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is too applyable to some <hi>prophane mouthes</hi> of our age, who by execrable <hi>oaths</hi> and <hi>Curses</hi> practise <hi>aforehand</hi> to blaspheme, rendring themselves (without their serious and seasonable repentance) in a neerer capacity to discourse with the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils</hi> and <hi>Damned</hi> in Hell.

                  <p>Now for the ground thereof, it is no other than an old <hi>Iewish</hi> Tradition, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, that this being the common Language of all people before the Flood, was afterwards appropriated unto <hi>Phaleg</hi> (the son of <hi>Heber</hi>) and to his Posterity, because not present with the rest at the bullding of <hi>Babel,</hi> and consequently not within the curse of confounded Languages.<note place="margin">

                  <p>Before we come to the serious examination of the point in hand, I would sain be satisfied what means this marginal note, (<hi>Heylins Cosmographie, page</hi> 19.) What?

                  <p>Now that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> was the <hi>common Tongue of the world,</hi> before the <hi>Confusion</hi> at <hi>Babel,</hi> is more than a <hi>meer Tradition,</hi> being <hi>back<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> with many Authorities and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>answerable Arguments.</p>
                  <p>Of Authorities, we begin with St. <hi>Hierom, one</hi> who is <hi>many Authors</hi> in this Point (because of his great and general skil in Languages) and who in his <hi>Comment</hi> on <hi>Zephany, chapt.</hi> 3.18. affirmeth, <hi>Linguam Hebraicam omnium Linguarum esse Matricem, that the Hebrew is the Mother of all Languages.

                  </p>
                  <p>To these I will add a <hi>Iury</hi> of publike Professors, all of Eminent note, since the reviving of Languages in the Western world.

                  <p>And secondly, that it is such a <hi>Tradition,</hi> as holds no good coherence with the truth of Story, it being a most clear and demonstrative truth, that the <hi>Hebrew</hi> tongue was not the Language which <hi>Abraham</hi> brought with him out of <hi>Chaldea</hi> and <hi>Mesopotamia,</hi> but that which he found spoken in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> at his coming thither, to which both he and his posterity did conform themselves. Or had it been the Language of <hi>Heber,</hi> as they say it was, (but most undoubtedly was not) yet, thirdly, had this been a priviledge conferred on <hi>Heber,</hi> that he and his posterity should speak the Original Language without alteration or corruption, it must have been extended to all those of the house of <hi>Iocktan,</hi> which descend from him; as also to the house of <hi>Laban</hi> in <hi>Padan-Aram,</hi> and to the <hi>Moabites,</hi> and the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> as the seed of <hi>Lot</hi>; and finally to the <hi>Madianites, Ishmaelites,</hi> and <hi>Idu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maeans,</hi> descended of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Esau</hi>; and not be limited and confined onely to the House of <hi>Iacob.</hi> Now that the language which afterwards was and still is called by the name of the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> was spoken vulgarly in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the coming of <hi>Abraham</hi> thither, is not affirmed by <hi>Brerewood</hi> onely, but by <hi>Scaliger, Grotius, Vossius, Bochartus,</hi> (all of them men of great renown for their learned studies) and by many others of this age. By most of which it is affirmed also, that the name of <hi>Hebrews</hi> was given unto them by the people of <hi>Canaan,</hi> not in regard of their descent from <hi>Heber</hi> the father of <hi>Phaleg,</hi> but from <hi>Abrahams</hi> passing over the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> when he came out of <hi>Chaldaea</hi> with his Family to dwell amongst them; that name in the <hi>Canaanitish</hi> language signifying as much as <hi>trajiciens</hi> or <hi>transfluvialis</hi>; and therefore not unfitly given by them to <hi>Abraham</hi> at his first coming thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>There be Three <hi>distinct Questions,</hi> which the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> doth purposely huddle together for his own advantage.
<list>
                        <item>1. Whether the <hi>Hebrew was the common Tongue of the old World.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2. Whether the <hi>Hebrew</hi> was so preserved in the <hi>posterity</hi> of <hi>Heber,</hi> and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to his Family, that no other communicated therein.</item>
                        <item>3. Whether <hi>Abraham</hi> did bring the <hi>Hebrew Tongue</hi> into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> or rather found it there, as spoken formerly by the <hi>Natives</hi> thereof.</item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such as maintain the first, of the <hi>Coevity</hi> of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> with the <hi>World</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> are not necessarily obliged to defend the two latter.</p>
                  <p>I <hi>said</hi> and <hi>onely said,</hi> (as neither inforcing it, nor inferring any thing thence) that the <hi>Hebrew was the common Tongue of the world,</hi> and have proved it. The <hi>rest</hi> I am ready to say, so soon as the affirming thereof shall <hi>lye in my way,</hi> or <hi>make for my work,</hi> and then (God willing) I will defend my <hi>positions. Til then</hi> I will <hi>gratifie</hi> the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> with no other Answer; and that for these reasons: 1. To shew my own <hi>liberty,</hi> that <hi>I am free born,</hi> and not bound to <hi>lacquey</hi> after his <hi>Animadversions</hi> when I have no businesse of my own. 2. To wean him from <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosenesse,</hi> by not indulging too much to his humor therein. Lastly, to spare <hi>time,</hi> my <hi>own,</hi> and the <hi>Readers pains</hi> now, that we may the more seasonably spend them hereafter, on matter of more importance.</p>

The <hi>Cimbrick Cherso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nese,</hi> truly and properly so call'd, comprehended onely those parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Denmark</hi> which we now call <hi>Iuitland,</hi> divided by the River <hi>Eydore</hi> from the Dukedome of <hi>Holstein.

                  <p>That <hi>Denmark, Norway,</hi> and <hi>Swedeland</hi> are a <hi>Chersonesus,</hi> or <hi>almost an Island,</hi> the Animadvertor will not deny. But that I called them the <hi>Cimbrian Chersonese,</hi> cannot clearly be collected from those my words, <hi>take it in the largest extent</hi>; which amount onely to a <hi>Concession,</hi> to such who have a mind so to <hi>accept</hi> it, and to extend the bounds thereof.</p>
                  <p>Here plainly to discover my judgement, I conceive that those <hi>Sholes of People, did not,</hi> and yet <hi>did,</hi> come out of the <hi>Cimbrick Chersonese,</hi> in the <hi>strickt</hi> and true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception thereof.</p>
                  <p>They <hi>did not,</hi> that is, they came not thence, as having all their birth therein. <hi>Iuitland,</hi> not so big as <hi>Yorkshire,</hi> and the <hi>Languet</hi> the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> speaks of, not bigger than <hi>Wales,</hi> being <hi>Hives</hi> too little to hold such <hi>swarmes</hi> and <hi>Cas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Yet I believe they did come out of that <hi>Chesonese immediatly,</hi> it being most probable, that out of the <hi>opposite Continent</hi> of <hi>Norway</hi> and Swedland, they crossed the <hi>Baltick-Sea,</hi> being narrowest thereabouts, and so came into <hi>Iuitland,</hi> and thence <hi>Inunded</hi> the most of <hi>Europe.</hi>

The objection which our Author makes against it, is the barbarous style and language of it; which if it be a good objection against this Charter, will be as strong against all the Charters of this age, as some ages following in which there was but little of the Elegancies of the <hi>Latine tongue.</hi> And therefore this objection might have well been spared, but that our Author would be thought to deal very equally in the business, by saying all that might be said against himself.</p>

                  <p>Our Author telleth us, ibid. <hi>That whereas formerly there were manifold</hi> Laws <hi>in the Land, made, some by the</hi> Britains, <hi>others by the</hi> Danes, <hi>others by the</hi> English, <hi>&amp;c. He caused some few of the best to be selected, and the rest as captious and unnecessary, to be rejected; from whence they had the name of the Common Laws.</hi>] That the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Law was so call'd, because compounded of the <hi>Saxon, British,</hi> and <hi>Danish</hi> Lawes, which were before of force onely in such places where the <hi>Danes, Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans</hi> and <hi>Saxons</hi> had the greatest sway; though it be easie to be said, will be hard to be proved. The <hi>Britains</hi> at that time liv'd under their own Princes, and were governed by their own Lawes, and so they were for a long time after; so that King <hi>Edward,</hi> having no dominion over them, could not impose a Law upon them. Nor was it propable that he should borrow any of their Laws, or impose them on his natural Subjects, considering the antipathy and disaffection betwixt the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. There were at that time indeed in <hi>England</hi> three kindes of Laws: The first called <hi>Dane-lage,</hi> or the <hi>Danish</hi> Laws, prevailing for the most part in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the <hi>East-Angles,</hi> and that of <hi>Northumberland:</hi> Secondly, <hi>Saxon-lage,</hi> used generally in the Kingdoms of the <hi>West-Saxons, East-Saxons, South-Saxons,</hi> and that of <hi>Kent:</hi> And thirdly, <hi>Mercen-lage,</hi> extending over all the Provinces of the Kingdome of <hi>Mercia.</hi> As for the <hi>Britans</hi> of <hi>Cornwall</hi> and <hi>Cumberland,</hi> they had no distinct Law for themselves (as had those of <hi>Wales</hi>) but were governed by the Laws of that Nation unto which they were Subject. By these three sorts of Laws were these Nations governed in their several and respective limits, which being afterwards reduced into one body, and made common equally to all the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, did worthily deserve the name of the Common-Law. But secondly I dare not give the honour of this Action to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor. The great <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinian</hi> in this work was another <hi>Edward,</hi> called, for distinctions sake, King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the elder, who began his Reign <hi>Anno</hi> 900. almost 150 years before this <hi>Confessor,</hi> to whom our Author hath ascribed it. But the truth is, that these Laws being suppressed by the <hi>Danish</hi> Kings, who governed either in an arbitrary way, or by Laws of their own Countrey, they were revived and reinforced in the time of this <hi>Edward,</hi> from whence they had the name of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessors Laws, and by that name were sued and fought for in the time succeeding, of which more hereafter. Now as this work may be ascribed to his love to Justice; so from his piety, his successors derive as great a benefit of curing the disease which from thence is called the Kings-Evill, which some impute (as our Author tells us) to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and hidden causes.</p>

                  <p>Upon occasion of which Conquest, our Author telleth us that, Ibid. <hi>This was the fifth time wherein the South of this Island was conquered; first by</hi> Romans, <hi>second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by</hi> Picts <hi>and</hi> Scots, <hi>thirdly by</hi> Saxons, <hi>fourthly by the</hi> Danes, <hi>and fifthly by the</hi> Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.] But this I can by no means yeeld to, the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> not being to be nam'd amongst those Nations who <hi>subdued</hi> the South part of this Island. That they did many times harrass and depopulate the South part of it, I shall easily grant; but to the subduing of a Countrey, there is more required than to waste and spoil it; that is to say, to fix their dwelling and abode (for some time at least) in the Countrey conquered; to change the Laws, alter the Language, or new mould the Government; or finally, to translate the Scepter from the old Royal Family to some one of their own. None of which things being done in the Invasions of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts,</hi> they cannot properly be said to have <hi>subdued</hi> the South parts of the Island, as our Author (out of love perhaps to the <hi>Scots</hi>) would perswade the Reader.</p>

                  <p>WE are now come unto the times of the <hi>Norman</hi> Government, when the Church began to settle on a surer bottom, both for power and polity; the Bishops lesse obnoxious to the Kings than formerly, because elected by the <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Canons</hi> of their own <hi>Cathedrals</hi>; their <hi>Consistories</hi> free from the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of Lay-assistance, and their <hi>Synods</hi> manag'd by themselves.

                  <p>All this is but <hi>perfatary,</hi> and therefore my <hi>Answer</hi> not necessary thereunto.

                     <hi>The Answer thereunto was this.</hi>
                     <q>
                        <p>TO this we say, that forasmuch as we repute and take our Authority of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Laws to be grounded upon the Scripture of God, and the determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of holy Church, which must also be a rule and squier to try the justice and righteousnesse of all Laws, as well Spiritual as Temporal; we verily trust, that considering the Laws of this Realm be such as have been made by most Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, religious, and devout Princes and People, how both these Laws proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from one fountain, the same being sincerely interpretrd, and after the good meaning of the makers, there shall be found no repugnancy, nor contrariety, but that the one shall be found as aiding, maintaining, and supporting the other. And if it shall otherwise appear, as it is our duty (whereunto we shall alwayes most diligently apply our selves) to reform our Ordinances to Gods Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to conform our Statutes and Laws, and those of our predecessors, to the determination of Scripture and holy Church; so we hope in God, and shall daily pray for the same, that your Highnesse will, if there appear cause why, with the assent of your People, temper your Graces Laws accordingly. Whereby shall ensue a most happy and perfect conjunction and agreement, as God being <hi>Lapis angularis,</hi> to agree and conjoyn the same. And as concerning the requiring of your <hi>Highnesse Royal assent</hi> to the authority of such Laws as have been by our Predecessors, or shall be made by us in such points and Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles as we have by Gods authority to rule and order by such Provisions and Laws; we knowing your Highness wisdome, and vertue, and learning, nothing doubt but the same perceiveth how the granting hereunto dependeth not upon our will and liberty. And that we your most humble Subjects may not submit the execution of our charge and duty certainly prescribed by God, to your <hi>Highnesse assent,</hi> although in very deed the same is most worthy for your most Noble, Princely, and excellent vertues, not onely to give your <hi>Royal assent,</hi> but also to devise and command what we should for good order and manners by Statutes and Laws provide in the Church, neverthelesse considering we may not so, ne in such sort refrain the doing of our office in the feeding and ruling of Christs people your Graces Subjects; we most humbly desiring your Grace
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61668:60"/>
as the same hath heretofore, so from henceforth to shew your Graces minde and opinion unto us, what your high Wisdome shall think convenient, which we shall most gladly hear and follow, if it shall please God to inspire us so to doe, with all submission and humility beseech the same, following the steps of of your most Noble Progenitors, and conformably to your our own Acts doe maintain and defend such Laws, and Ordinances, as we according to our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and by Authority of God, shall for his honour make, to the edification of vertue, and maintaining Christs faith, of which your Highnesse is named Defender, and hath been hitherto indeed a special Protector. </p>
                        <p>Furthermore whereas your said Lay Subjects say, that sundry of the said Laws extend in certain causes to your excellent Person, your Liberty and Prerogative Royal, and to the interdiction of your Land and Possessions: To this your said Orators say, that having submitted the tryal and examining of the Laws made in the Church by us and our Predecessors, to the just and straight Rule of Gods Laws, which giveth measure of Power, Prerogative, and Authority to all Emperors, Kings, Princes, and Potentates, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; we have conceiv'd such opinion, and have such estimation of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties goodnesse and vertue, that whatsoever any persons not so well learned as your Grace is, would pretend unto the same, whereby we your most hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Subjects may be brought in your Graces displeasure and indignation, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising that we should by usurpation and presumption, extend our Laws to your most noble Person, Prerogative and Realm, yet the same your High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse being so highly learn'd, will of your own most bounteous goodnesse fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilly discharge and deliver us from that envy, when it shall appear that the said Laws are made by us, or out Predecessors, conformable and maintainable by the Scripture of God, and determination of the Church, against which no Laws can stand or take effect.</p>
                     </q>
Somewhat to this purpose had been before endeavoured by the Commons in the last Parliament of King <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. of which, because they got nothing by it, but only the shewing of their teeth without hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any body; I shall lay nothing in this place, reserving it to the time of the long Parliament, in the Reign of King <hi>Charles,</hi> when this point was more hotly followed, and more powerfully prosecuted than ever formerly.</p>
                  <p>What sayes our Author unto this? Findes he here any such matter, as that <hi>the Laity at their pleasure could limit the Canons</hi> of the Church? Or that such Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons in <hi>whatsoever touched temporals were subject unto secular Laws and National Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes?</hi> And here of I desire the Reader to take special notice, as that which is to serve for a <hi>Catholicon,</hi> or general Antidote against those many venomous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuations, which he shall meet with up and down in the course of this History. As for the case in which our Author grounds this pestilent Position, it was the Canon made in a <hi>Synod</hi> at <hi>Westminster,</hi> in the time of <hi>Anselm, Anno</hi> 1102. prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting <hi>the sale of men and women like brute beasts</hi> in the open Market. Which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non not finding presently an universal obedience over all the Kingdome (as certainly ill customes are not easily left, when they are countenanced by profit) occasioned our Author to adventure upon this bold assertion.</p>

                  <p>It cannot be denyed, but that the Clergy did claim and challenge a power, and sometimes <hi>de facto</hi> executed it, over the temporal Estates of the La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>We have an eminent instance hereof, in the Canon, occasioning this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.

                  <p>Suppose a Convocation some thirty years agoe should have made a Canon, without any confirmation from Parliament, That no Merchant living in <hi>England</hi> should by his Factors sell any <hi>Negroes</hi> or <hi>Blacks</hi> in the <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> which formerly he had bought in <hi>Guinnie,</hi> it would not oblige to the observation thereof; because in such matters wherein <hi>propertie</hi> was concerned, the <hi>Canon</hi> must say to the <hi>Common-Law, By your leave Sir.</hi>

                  <p>But whatsoever our Author thinks, it cannot but appear to any who consults the story of former times, that the original of this Charter, was first writ in blood, obtain'd by working on the necessities of some Princes, extorted in the minority of another, and finally confirm'd by him who had not power to justifie his denial of it.</p>

                  <p>And fourthly he tels us, That the <hi>Garter</hi> is one of the <hi>extraordinary</hi> Habiliments of the Knights of this Order, their <hi>ordinary</hi> being onely the <hi>blew Ribbon</hi> about their necks, <hi>with the Picture of St.</hi> George <hi>appendant, and the Sun in his glory on the left shoulder of their Cloak</hi>; whereas indeed the <hi>Garter</hi> is of common wearing, and of such necessary use, that the <hi>Knights</hi> are not to be seen abroad without it, <hi>upon pain
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61668:65"/>
of paying two Crowns to any Officer of the Order, who shall first claim it, unlesse they be to take a journey</hi>;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hist. of St. George lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.8.</note> in which case <hi>it is sufficient to wear a blew Ribbon under their Boots to denote the Garter.</hi> Lastly, whereas our Author tells us, that the Knights hereof doe weare <hi>on the left shoulder of their Cloaks a Sun in his glory,</hi> and attributes this wearing, as some say, to King <hi>Charles.</hi> I will first put him out of doubt, that this addition was King <hi>Charles</hi> his; then shew him his mistake in the matter it self. And first, in the first year of that King, <hi>Apr.</hi> 26. 1626. it was thus enacted at a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Chapter</hi> of the Order, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>That all Knights and Companions of the Order, shall wear upon the left part of their <hi>Cloaks, Coats,</hi> and riding <hi>Cassocks</hi> at all times when they shall not wear their Roabs, and in all places of Assembly, an Escocheon of the Armes of St. <hi>George, id est,</hi> a Crosse within a Garter, not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with Pearls or Stones: in token of the honour which they hold from the said most noble Order, instituted and ordained for persons of the highest worth and honour.</q>
Our Author, secondly, may perceive by this Act of the Kings, that St. <hi>Georges</hi> Crosse within the Garter, is the main device injoyned to be worn by all the <hi>Knights</hi> of that noble Order; to which the adding of the <hi>Sun in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> served but for ornament and imbellishing, and might be either used or not used (but onely for conformities sake) as they would themselves.</p>

                  <p>Fol. 490. Sir Edward Montague <hi>had three sonnes,</hi> Edward <hi>the eldest Knight of the</hi> Bath, &amp;c.] The Author here is much mistaken in the House of the <hi>Montagues.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For first, that <hi>Edward Montague</hi> who was <hi>Knight of the Bath, &amp;c.</hi> was not Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to <hi>Iames</hi> Bishop of Winchester, and <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of Manchester, but their Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Son, that is to say, the Son of another <hi>Edward</hi> their eldest Brother.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, besides that, <hi>Edward, Iames, and Henry,</hi> there was another Brother whom the Author names not, though he could not chuse but know the man, <hi>viz.</hi> Sir <hi>Sidney Montague,</hi> one of the Masters of the Requests to the late King <hi>Charles.</hi> Therefore to set this matter right, I am to let both him and his Readers know, that Sir <hi>Edward Montague</hi> chief Justice in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the sixth, was father of another <hi>Edward</hi> who lived peaceably and nobly in his own Country. To whom succeeded a third <hi>Edward,</hi> who sought for honour in the Wars, and gained the reputation of a good Commander<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the elder Brother of <hi>Iames, Henry,</hi> and <hi>Sidney</hi> before mentioned, and the father of a fourth <hi>Edward</hi> who was made <hi>Knight of the Bath,</hi> at the Coronation of King <hi>Iames, Anno</hi> 1603. and afterwards created Lord <hi>Montague</hi> of <hi>Boughton</hi> in the nineteenth year of that King, <hi>Anno</hi> 1621. which honourable Title is now enjoyed by his Son (another <hi>Edward</hi>) <hi>Anno</hi> 1658.</p>
                  <p>And thirdly, though I grant that Dr. <hi>Iames Montague</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> (the second Brother of the four) was of great power and favour in the time of King <hi>Iames.</hi>

               <head>THE FOURTH BOOK. From the first preaching of <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> to the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth.</head>

                  <p>OUR Author begins this Book with the Story of <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth it in relating the successes of him and his followers, to which he seems so much addicted, as to Christen their Opinions by the name of the Gospel: For, speaking of such incouragements and helps as were given to <hi>Wickliffe</hi> by the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> with other advantages, which the conditions of those times did afford unto him, he addeth, That,</p>
                  <p>Fol. 129. <hi>We must attribute the main to Divine Providence blessing the</hi> Gospel.] A name too high to be bestowed upon the Fancies of a private man, many of whose Opinions were so far from truth, so contrary to peace and civil Order, so inconsistent with the Government of the Church of <hi>Christ,</hi> as make them utterly unworthy to be look'd on as a part of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> Or if the Doctrines of <hi>Wickliffe</hi> must be call'd the <hi>Gospel,</hi> what shall become of the Religion then establisht in the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and in most other parts of the <hi>Western</hi> World? Were all but <hi>Wickliffes</hi> Followers relaps'd to <hi>Heathenism</hi>; were they turn'd Jews, or had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd the Law of <hi>Mahomet</hi>? If none of these, and that they still continued in the faith of <hi>Christ,</hi> delivered to them in the <hi>Gospels</hi> of the four <hi>Evangelists</hi> and other Apostolicall Writers, <hi>Wickliffes</hi> new Doctrines could not challenge the name of <hi>Gospel,</hi> no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ought it to be given to him by the Pen of any. But such is the humor of some men, as to call every separation from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> by the name of <hi>Gospel,</hi> the greater the separation is, the more pure the <hi>Gospel.</hi> No name but that of <hi>Evangelici</hi> would content the <hi>Germans</hi> when they first separated from that <hi>Church,</hi> and reformed their own: And <hi>Harry Nichols,</hi> when he separated from the <hi>German</hi> Churches, and became the Father of <hi>Familists,</hi> bestows the name of <hi>Evangelium Regni</hi> on his Dreams and Dotages. <hi>Gospels</hi> of this kinde we have had, and may have too many, <hi>quot Capita t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now as <hi>Wickliffes</hi> Doctrines are advanc'd to the name of <hi>Gospel,</hi> so his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers whatsoever they were) must be called <hi>Gods servants,</hi> the Bishops being said <hi>fol.</hi> 151. to be busie in persecuting Gods servants; and for what crime soever, they were brought to punishment, it must be thought they suffered onely for the <hi>Gospel</hi> and the <hi>service</hi> of God. A pregnant evidence whereof we have in the story of Sir <hi>Iohn Oldcastle,</hi> accused in the time of King <hi>Harry</hi> the fifth for a design to kill the King and his Brethren, actually in Arms against that King in the head of 20000 men,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Stow in Hen</hi> 5.</note> attainted for the same in open Parliament, and condemn'd to die, and executed in St. <hi>Giles</hi> his Fields accordingly, as both Sir <hi>Roger Acton</hi> his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Counsellor, and 37 of his Accomplices had been before. For this we have not onely the Authority of our common Chronicles, <hi>Walsingham, Stow,</hi> and many
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61668:67"/>
others; but the Records of the Tower, and Acts of Parliament, as is confessed by our Author, <hi>fol.</hi> 168. Yet coming out of <hi>Wickliffes</hi> Schools, and the chief Scholar questionlesse which was train'd up in them, he must be Registred for a <hi>Martyr</hi> in <hi>Fox</hi> his Calendar. And though our Author dares not quit him, (as he sayes himself) yet such is his tendernesse and respect to <hi>Wickliffes Gospel,</hi> that he <hi>is loath to load his Memory with causlesse Crimes</hi>; fol. 167. taxeth the <hi>Clergie</hi> of that time for their hatred to him, discrediteth the relation of <hi>T. Walsingham,</hi> and all later Authors, who are affirm'd <hi>to follow him, as the Flock their Belweather</hi>; and finally leaves it as a special verdict <hi>to the last day of the Revelation of the righteous Iudgements of God.</hi>

                  <p>First, I fain would know, whether the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> would be contented with the Condition of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as <hi>Wickliffe</hi> found it, for <hi>Opinions</hi> and <hi>Practise,</hi> and doth not earnestly desire a Reformation thereof.</p>
                  <p>I am charitably confident, that He doth desire such an <hi>Emendation,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being both of us agreed in this <hi>Point</hi> of the <hi>convenience,</hi> yea <hi>necessity</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; in the second place I would as fain be satisfied from the <hi>Animadvertor,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther He conceived it possible, that such Reformation could be advanced (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Miracle</hi>) all on a sodain, so that many grosse Errors would not <hi>continue,</hi> and some new one be superadded.</p>
                  <p>The man in the Gospel first saw <hi>men walking as trees,</hi> before he saw per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly. Nature hath appointed the <hi>Twilight</hi> as a <hi>Bridge</hi> to passe us out of <hi>Night</hi> into <hi>Day.</hi> Such false and wild opinions (like the <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 9.18.</note> 
                     <hi>Scales,</hi> which fell down from the Eyes of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> when perfectly restored to his sight) have either <hi>vanished</hi> or been <hi>banished,</hi> out of all <hi>Protestant Confession.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Far be it from me to account the rest of <hi>England</hi> relapsed into <hi>Atheism,</hi> or lapsed in <hi>Iudaism, Turcism, &amp;c.</hi> whom I behold as <hi>Erronious Christians</hi> in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> and <hi>Practise,</hi> and yet still in such a condition, that though so living and dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if <hi>they lead a good life, and being weak, ignorant, and seduced, seriously repented of all their sins of ignorance,</hi> they <hi>might be saved;</hi> closing fully with the moderate Judgement of learned <hi>Hooker</hi> herein.</p>
                  <p>I know that the very worst of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> have assumed to themselves the very best of <hi>Names, gilding</hi> themselves over with the Title of <hi>Gospellers,</hi> and the like; but because <hi>Thieves</hi> often pretend themselves <hi>honest men,</hi> may not <hi>honest men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow</hi> themselves to be <hi>so,</hi> and also be so termed by others?</p>
                  <p>The words of the Animadvertor of <hi>Wickliffs Gospel,</hi> might well have been spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, seeing indeed it was <hi>Christs Gospel</hi> (<hi>dawning</hi> is part of <hi>day</hi>) preached by <hi>Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liffe,</hi> in a <hi>purer</hi> manner than in <hi>that Age,</hi> (thanks to God it was <hi>then</hi> so <hi>good</hi>;) <hi>impurer</hi> than in our Age, thanks be to God it <hi>now</hi> is <hi>better.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for Sir <hi>Iohn Oldcastle</hi> L. <hi>Cobham,</hi> his Case is so perplexed with contrary relations <hi>much</hi> may be said against him, and <hi>little lesse</hi> in his behalf; and I have cause to beleeve indeed, that his Innocence wanted not <hi>clearnesse</hi> but <hi>clearing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas the Animadvertor takes exception at my referring the <hi>Decision</hi> here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to the revelation of the <hi>righteous judgement of God,</hi> it must be Either because

                  <p>From the <hi>Scholar</hi> passe we to the <hi>Master,</hi> of whom it is reported in a late <hi>Popish</hi> Pamphlet, that he made a recantation of his Errors, and liv'd and dyed confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> This I will behold as a notorious falshood, an
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:61668:67"/>
imposture of the <hi>Romish</hi> party, though the argument used by our Author, be not of strength sufficient to inforce me to it. <hi>If,</hi> saith he, Wickliffe <hi>was sufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd to the Roman faith, why was not</hi> Rome <hi>sufficiently reconciled to him? Using such cruelty to him many years after his death, fol.</hi> 171. But this, say I, is no reason, of no force at all. <hi>Wickliffe</hi> might possibly be reconcil'd to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet the Ministers of that <hi>Church,</hi> to strike a terror into others, might execute that veng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But being cunningly wrought on by some Emissaries of the <hi>Romish</hi> party in the year 1622. he went back to <hi>Rome,</hi> was reconcil'd to that Church, and writ there most reproachfully of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; which notwithstanding, he was kept prisoner all the rest of his life, and his body burnt to ashes after his decease. So then it is no such new matter for a dissenting Christian, such as <hi>Wickliff</hi> and <hi>de Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minis</hi> were, though branded by the name of Hereticks, to be admitted to a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and yet that Church to carry a revengefull minde towards them when occasion serves.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Spalato</hi> is no proper parallel of <hi>Wickliffe,</hi> in this point. <hi>Spalato</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted a new <note n="*" place="margin">Out of exact intelligence sent from his neer Kindred, to <hi>Venice,</hi> and thence to Mr. <hi>Calendrine,</hi> now Minister of the Dutch Church.</note> Guilt, by bragging at the Table of a Cardinal in <hi>Rome,</hi> that his Book <hi>de Repub.

In order whereunto, as in a matter which concern'd the life of a Subject, the King with the advice of his Parliament, might lay down some rules for the regulating the proceedings of the Bishops and other Ordinaries.</p>

                  <p>Our Author proceeds. Fol. 183. <hi>This good precedent of the Archbishops bounty</hi> (that is to say, the foundation of <hi>All-souls</hi> Colledge by Archbishop <hi>Chiche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>) <hi>may be presumed a spur to the speed of the Kings liberality; who soon after founded</hi> Eaton Colledge, <hi>&amp;c. to be a Nursery to</hi> Kings Colledge <hi>in</hi> Cambridge, fol. 184.] Of <hi>Eaton Colledge,</hi> and the condition of the same, our Author hath spoken here at large, but we must look for the foundation of <hi>Kings Colledge,</hi> in the History of <hi>Cambridge, fol.</hi> 77. where I finde something which requireth an <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.</hi> Our Author there chargeth Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi> for avowing something which he cannot justifie, that is to say, for saying,
<q>That when <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Wainfleet</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester</hi> (afterwards founder of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge) perswaded King <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth, to erect some Monument for Learning in <hi>Oxford,</hi> the King returned, <hi>Imo potius Cantabrigiae, ut duas (si fieri possit) in Anglia Academias ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam.</hi> Yea rather (said he) at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> that (if it be possible) I may have two Universities in <hi>England.</hi>
                     </q>
As if <hi>Cambridge</hi> were not reputed one before the founding of <hi>Kings</hi> Colledge therein. But here the premisses onely are the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, the inference or conclusion is our Authors own. The Doctor infers not thereupon, that <hi>Cambridge was not reputed an University till the founding of</hi> Kings Colledge <hi>by King</hi> Henry <hi>the sixth</hi>; and indeed he could not: for he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged before out of <hi>Robert de Renington,</hi> that it was made an <hi>University</hi> in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the second. All that the Doctor sayes, is this, <hi>that as the University of</hi> Cambridge <hi>was of a later foundation</hi> then <hi>Oxford</hi> was, <hi>so it was long before it grew into esteem,</hi> that is to say, to such a measure of esteem at home or abroad (before the building of <hi>Kings Colledge,</hi> and the rest that followed) but that the King might use those words in his discourse with the Bishop of <hi>Winchester.</hi> And for the Narrative, the Doctor (whom I have talked with in this businesse) doth not shame to say, that he borrowed it, from that great Treasury of Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Antiquities Mr. <hi>Brian Twine,</hi> whose learned Works stand good against all Opponents; and that he found the passage justified by Sir <hi>Isaack Wake</hi> in his <hi>Rex Platonicus.</hi> Two Persons of too great wit and judgement, to relate a matter of this nature on no better ground than common <hi>Table-talk,</hi> and that too spoke in merriment by Sir <hi>Henry Savil.</hi> Assuredly Sir <hi>Henry Savil</hi> was too great a Zealot for that University, and too much a friend to Mr. <hi>Wake,</hi> who was Fellow of the same Colledge with him, to have his <hi>Table-talk</hi> and discourses of merriment to be put upon Record as grounds and arguments for such men to build on in that weighty Controversie. And therefore when our Author tells us, what he was told by Mr. <hi>Hubbard,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hubbard</hi> by Mr. <hi>Barlow,</hi> Mr. <hi>Barlow</hi> by Mr. <hi>Bust,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bust</hi> by Sir <hi>Henry Savil.</hi> It brings into my minde the like Pedegree of as true a Story, even that of Mother <hi>Miso</hi> in Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> telling the young Ladies an old Tale, which <hi>a good old woman told her, which an old wise man told her, which a great learned Clerk told him, and gave it him in writing; and there she had it in her Prayer-book</hi>; as here our Author hath found this on the end of his <hi>Creed.</hi> Not much unlike to which, is that which I finde in the Poet;

                  <p>Both our Relations ultimately terminate in <hi>Sir Isaack Wake,</hi> by the Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertor confessed the first <hi>printed Reporter</hi> thereof.

                  <p>Indeed it met not with universal Reception for some years (<hi>babits</hi> not being easily deposed:) and therefore the <hi>Convocation</hi> concurring with the Kings plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure therein, added their assistance in the year 1530. as the Animadvertor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serveth; and soon after by the Kings Proclamation, the matter was generally effected.</p>
                  <p>But whereas he sayth, That after that time 1530. <hi>William Lillye was thought the fittest man for that undertaking,</hi> Let me tell him, That a man dead <hi>five,</hi> if not <hi>eight</hi> years before, was not fit to make a Grammar.</p>

Which though our Author doth defend as <hi>Expressions rather than Opinions,</hi> the <hi>Careers of the Soul,</hi> and <hi>Extravagancies of humane infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> as he doth the rest; yet he that looks upon these points, and sees not in them the rude draught and lineaments of the <hi>Puritan</hi> Plat-form, which they have been hammering since the time of <hi>Cartwright</hi> and his Associates, must either have bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter eyes than mine, or no eyes at all. I see our Author looks for thanks for this discovery for publishing the paper which contain'd these <hi>new Protestant</hi> truths, and I give him mine.</p>

                  <p>I have many things to return in this Contest. <hi>First,</hi> had I <hi>garbled</hi> the <hi>Opinions</hi>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:61668:78"/>
of my own Head, and not presented them to the Reader, as I found them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented in the <hi>Records of the Convocation,</hi> then the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> had had just ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage against me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> He taketh exception at me in his <hi>Introduction,</hi> for not giving in <hi>the Degrees by which Heterodoxies in Religion were ejected and cast out:</hi> Yet not he is offended at me, because I goe about to doe it, shewing how bad Religion was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Reformation, even in the best Professors thereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is more than probable, that these Opinions, presented by such as were <hi>disaffected</hi> to the <hi>Reformation,</hi> were not <hi>over favourably</hi> stated, but rather <hi>worded</hi> to the <hi>disadvantage.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Some of these Opinions, thus condemned by the Animadvertor, are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ound in themselves. I instance in that which in this his <hi>List</hi> is the eleventh in number, <hi>viz That it is sufficient for a man or woman to make confession to God alone.</hi> This at this day is defended by the Protestan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> Church, which though <hi>commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Confession</hi> as <hi>expedient</hi> in some cases, especially when the <hi>afflicted Conscience</hi> cannot otherwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e, yet doth it not <hi>command</hi> it on any as necessary, <hi>necessitate precepti,</hi> so that the <hi>omission</hi> thereof should <hi>amount</hi> to a sin. I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> himself never solemnly <hi>confessed</hi> his sins to any but to <hi>God alo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e.</hi> And it is injurious in him, to demand of another to doe that which was never done by himself.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Lastly,</hi> How unjust were it to put all <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <hi>Ieremies bud figs by themselves,</hi> and thence to conclude <hi>all the rest</hi> (which indeed were <hi>very good</hi>) to be like unto them? Such the dealing of the <hi>Animadvertor herein,</hi> who hath <hi>called</hi> out the very <hi>Refuse</hi> and <hi>Dross of the Dross</hi> in these Opinions, and left out the rest, then maintained by Gods People in opposition to the <hi>Errors</hi> and <hi>Superstition</hi> of that Age, some whereof are here inserted.

our Author by the Parliament to suppresse them also, and not to have given them any place in the present History, especially not to have produc'd those arguments by which some shamelesse persons endeavoured <hi>to maintain both the conveniency and necessity of</hi> such common <hi>Brothel-houses.</hi>

                  <p>Indeed it is reported of <hi>Zeuxes,</hi> that famous Painter, that he so lively pictured a Boy with a Rod in his hand, carrying a Basket of Grapes, that <hi>Birds</hi> (mistaking them for real ones) peckt at them; and whilest others commended his <hi>Art,</hi> he was angry with his <hi>own work-manship,</hi> confessing, that if he had made the <hi>Boy</hi> but as well as the <hi>Grapes,</hi> the <hi>Birds</hi> durst not adventure at them.</p>
                  <p>I have the same just cause to be offended with my own indeavors, if the Arguments against those <hi>Schools of Wantonnesse</hi> should prove insufficient, though I am confident that if seriously considered, they doe in their own true weight pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate those produced in favour of them.

                  <p>Our Author proceeds. Fol. 253. <hi>Otherwise some suspect, had he survived</hi> King Edward <hi>the sixth, we might presently have heard of a</hi> King Henry <hi>the ninth.</hi>] Our Author speaks this of <hi>Henry Fitz Roy,</hi> the Kings natural Son by <hi>Elizabeth Blunt,</hi> and the great disturbance he might have wrought to the Kings two daughters in their Succession to the Crown. A Prince indeed whom his Father very highly cherished, creating him Duke of <hi>Somerset</hi> and <hi>Richmond,</hi> Earl of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> and Earl Marshal of <hi>England,</hi> and raising him to no small hopes of the Crown it self, as appears plainly by the Statute 22 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 7. But whereas our Author speaks it on a supposition of his <hi>surviving King Edward the sixth,</hi> he should have done well in the first place to have inform'd himself, whether this <hi>Henry</hi> and Prince <hi>Edward</hi> were at any time alive together. And if my Books speak true, they were not; <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Somerset</hi> and <hi>Richmond</hi> dying the 22 of <hi>Iuly, Anno</hi> 1536. Prince <hi>Edward</hi> not being born till the 12 of <hi>October, Anno</hi> 1537.

of a Survivor-ship in such a case, when the one person had been long dead before the other was born.</p>

                  <p>These incoherent Animadversions being thus passed over, we now proceed to the Examination of our Authors <hi>Principles,</hi> for weakning the Authority of the Church, and subjecting it in all proceedings to the power of <hi>Parliaments.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which he had before given us two Rules Preparatory to the great busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse which we have in hand. First, <hi>that the proceedings of the Canon Law were sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in whatsoever touched temporals, to secular Laws and National Customes. And the Laitie at pleasure limited Canons in this behalf,</hi> Lib. 3. n. 61. And secondly, <hi>that the King by consent of Parliament directed the proceedings of the Ecclesiastical Court in cases of Heresie. Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>n.</hi> 88. And if the Ecclesiastical power was thus curbed and fettered when it was at the highest, there is no question to be made, but that it was much more obnoxious to the secular Courts when it began to sink in repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and decline in strength. How true and justifiable, or rather how unjusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable and false these two principles are, we have shewn already, and must now look into the rest, which our Author in pursuance of the main Design hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to us. But first we must take notice of another passage concerning the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of Convocations or Synodical meetings, formerly called by the two Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops in their several Provinces by their own sole and proper power, as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor grants, <hi>fol.</hi> 190. to which he adds,</p>
                  <p>Fol. 190. <hi>But after the Statute of</hi> Premunire <hi>was made (which did much restrain the Papal power, and subject it to the Laws of the Land) when Arcbishops called no more Convocations by their sole and absolute command, but at the pleasure of the King.</hi>] In which I must confesse my self to be much unsatisfied, though I finde the same position in some other Authors. My reasons two, 1. Because there is nothing in the Statu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e of <hi>Praemunire</hi> to restrain the Archbishops from calling these meetings as before; that Act extending onely to such as <hi>purchase or pursue, or cause to be purchased or pursued, in the Court of</hi> Rome, <hi>or elsewhere any such Translations, Processes, Sentences of Excommunication, Bulls, Instruments, or any other things whatsoever which touch the King, against him, his Crown and his Regality, or his Realm; or to such as bring within the Realm or them receive, or make thereof notification, or any other Execution whatsoever within the same Realm, or without, &amp;c.</hi> And secondly, because I finde in the Statute of the <hi>submission of the Clergy,</hi> that it was recognized and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by the <hi>Clergie</hi> in their <hi>Convocation,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Stat</hi> 25 <hi>H</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 19.</note> that the <hi>Convocation</hi> of the said <hi>Clergie</hi> is, alwaies hath been, <hi>and ought to be assembled alwaies by the Kings Writ.</hi> And if they had been alwaies call'd by the Kings Writ, then certainly before the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of <hi>Praemunire</hi>; for that the whole Clergy in their <hi>Convocation</hi> should pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely declare and avow a notorious falshood, especially in a matter of fact, is not a thing to be imagined. I must confesse my self to be at a losse in this intricate Labyrinth, unless perhaps there were some critical difference in those elder times between a <hi>Synod</hi> and a <hi>Convocation</hi>: the first being call'd by the Arch-bishops in their several and respective Provinces, as the necessities of the Church; the other only by the King, as his occasion and affairs did require the same. But whether this were so or not, is not much material, as the case now stands, the <hi>Clergie</hi> not assembling since the 25 of <hi>King Henry the eighth,</hi> but as they are convocated and convened by the Kings Writ only. I only add that the time and year of this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission is mistook by our Author<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who placeth it in 1533. whereas indeed the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:61668:79"/>
Clergy made this acknowledgement and submission in their Convocation, <hi>Anno</hi> 1532. though it pass'd not into an Act or Statute till the year next following. Well then, suppose the Clergy call'd by the Kings Authority, and all their Acts and Constitutions ratified by the <hi>Royals</hi> assent, are they of force to binde the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to submit and conform unto them? Not, if our Author may be judge; for he tels us plainly,</p>
                  <p>Fol. 191. That <hi>even such</hi> Convocations <hi>with the</hi> Royal assent, <hi>subject not any (for recusancie to obey their Canons) to a civil penalty in</hi> person <hi>or</hi> property, <hi>until confirmed by</hi> Act <hi>of</hi> Parliament.] I marvel where our Author took up this opinion, which he neither findes in the Registers of Convocation, or Records of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Himself hath told us, <hi>fol.</hi> 190. that <hi>such Canons and Constitutions</hi> as were <hi>concluded</hi> on in Synods or Convocations, before the passing of the Statute of <hi>Praemunire, were without any further Ratification, obligatory to all subjected to their jurisdiction.</hi> And he hath told us also of such Convocations as had been called between the passing of the Statute of <hi>Praemunire,</hi> and the <hi>Act</hi> for <hi>Submission,</hi> that <hi>they made Canons which were binding, although none other than</hi> Synodical Authority did <hi>confirm the same.</hi> Upon which premisses I shall not fear to raise this Syllogism, <hi>viz.</hi> That power which the Clergy had in their Convocations before their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to the King, to binde the Subject by their Canons and Constitutions <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any further ratification</hi> than own <hi>Synodical Authority,</hi> the same they had when the Kings power signified in his <hi>Royal assent</hi> was added to them; but the Clergy (by our Authors own confession) had power in their Convocations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their submission to the King, to bind the Subject by their Canons and Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, without any further ratification than their own Synodical Authority; <hi>Ergo</hi> they had the same power to bind the Subjects, when the Kings power signified by the Royal assent was added to them. The <hi>Minor</hi> being granted by our Author, as before is shewed, the <hi>Major</hi> is onely to be proved. And for the proof hereof, I am to put the Reader in minde of a Petition or Remonstrance exhibited to the King by the House of Commons, <hi>Anno</hi> 1532. in which they shewed themselves agrieved, that the Clergy of this Realm should act Authori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>atively and Supreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Convocations, and they in Parliament do nothing, but as it was confirmed and ratified by Royal assent. By which it seems that there was nothing then desired by the House of Commons, but that the Convocation should be brought down to the same level with the Houses of Parliament; and that their Acts and Constitutions should not binde the Subject as before, in their <hi>Goods</hi> and <hi>Possessions,</hi> until they were confirmed and ratified by the Regal Power. The Answer unto which Remonstrance being drawn up by Dr. <hi>Gardiner</hi> then newly made Bishop of <hi>Winchester,</hi> and allowed of by both Houses of Convocation, was by them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the King. But the <hi>King</hi> not satisfied with this Answer, resolves to bring them to his bent, lest else perhaps they might have acted something to the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance of his divorce, which was at that time in agitation; and therefore on the tenth of <hi>May</hi> he sends a Paper to them by Dr. <hi>Fox,</hi> (after Bishop of <hi>Hereford</hi>) in which it was peremptorily required, <hi>That no Constitution or Ordinance shall be hereafter by the Clergy Enacted, Promulged, or put in Execution, unlesse the Kings Highnesse do approve the same by his high Authority and Royal assent; and his advice and favour be also interponed for the execution of every such Constitution among his Highnesse Subjects.</hi> And though the Clergy on the receipt of this paper remov'd first to the Chappel of St. <hi>Katherines,</hi> and after unto that of St. <hi>Dunstan</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult about it, yet found they no Saint able to inspire them with a resolution con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the <hi>Kings</hi> desires; and therefore upon the Wednesday following, being the fifteenth of the same Moneth, they made their absolute submission, binding themselves <hi>in Verbo Sacerdotii,</hi> not to make or execute any Canons or other <hi>Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical</hi> Constitutions, but as they were from time to time enabled by the Kings Authority. But this submission being made unto the King in his single person, and not as in conjunction with his Houses of <hi>Parliament,</hi> could neither bring the Convocation under the command of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> nor render them obnoxi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>us to the power thereof, as indeed it did not. But to the contrary hereof it is said by our Author, that</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="tcp:61668:80"/>Fol. 194. <hi>He</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> the King) <hi>by the advice and consent of his</hi> Clergy <hi>in Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and great Councel in Parliament, resolved to reform the Church under his inspe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from grosse abuses crept into it.</hi>] To this I need no other Answer than our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himself, who though in this place he makes the Parliament to be joyned in Commission with Convocation, as if a joynt Agent in that great businesse of Reforming the Church; yet in another place he tels us another tale.
<q>For <hi>fol.</hi> 188. It will appear, saith he (and I can tell from whom he saith it) upon serious examination, that there was nothing done in the Reformation of Religion, save what was acted by the Clergy in their Convocations, or grounded on some Act of theirs precedent to it, with the Advice, Counsel, and Consent of the Bishops and most eminent Church-men; confirmed upon the Postfact, and not otherwise by the Civil Sanction, according to the usage of the best and happiest times of Christianity.</q>
So then the Reformation of the Church was acted chiefly by the King with the advice of the Clergy in their Convocation; the confirmation on the post-fact by the King in Parliament: and that (by his leave) not in all the Acts and Particulars of it, but in some few onely, for which consult the Tract entituled, <hi>The Way and Manner of the Reformation of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Now as our Author makes the Parliament a joynt Assistant with the King in the Reformation, so he conferreth on Parliaments the Supreme Power of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying and confirming all Synodical Acts.</p>
                  <p>Fol. 199. <hi>The</hi> Parliament (saith he) <hi>did notifie and declare that</hi> Ecclesiastical Power <hi>to be in the</hi> King, <hi>which the Pope had formerly unjustly invaded: Yet so, that they reserved to themselves the confirming power of all</hi> Canons Ecclesiastical; <hi>so that the person or property of</hi> Refusers <hi>should not be subjected to temporal penalty without consent of</hi> Parliament.] But certainly there is no such matter in that Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in which the <hi>submission</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> and the Authority of the King grounded thereupon is notified and recorded to succeeding times; nor any such reservation to themselves of a confirming power, as our Author speaks of, in any Act of Parliament (I can knowingly and boldly say it) from that time to this. Had there been any such Priviledge, any such <hi>Reservation</hi> as is here declared, their Power in <hi>confirming Ecclesiastical Canons</hi> had been Lord Paramount to the Kings; who could have acted nothing in it, but as he was enabled by his Houses of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nor is this onely a new and unheard of Paradox an Heterodoxie (as I may call it) in point of Law, but plainly contrary to the practise of the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> from that time to this; there being no <hi>Synodical Canons</hi> or Constitutions (I dare as boldly say this too) confirmed in Parliament, or any otherwise ratified, than by the superadding of the Royal assent. For proof whereof look we no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Canons of 603 and 640 confirmed by the two Kings respectively, and without any other Authority concurring with them in these following words (<hi>viz.</hi>)
<q>We have therefore for Us, our Heirs, and lawfull Successors, of our espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Grace, certain knowledge, and meer motion, given, and by these presents doe give our Royal assent according to the form of the said Statute or Act of Parliament aforesaid, to all and every of the said Canons, Orders, Ordinances, and Constitutions, and to all and every thing in them contained. And further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, we doe not onely by our said Prerogative Royal, and Supreme Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, in causes Ecclesiastical, ratifie, confirm, and establish by these our Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents, the said Canons, Orders, Ordinances, and Constitutions, and all and every thing in them contained, as is aforesaid: But doe likewise propound, publish, and straightly enjoyn and command by our said Authority, and by these our Letters Patents, the same to be diligently observed, executed, and equally kept by all our loving Subjects of this our Kingdome, both within the Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> in all points wherein they doe or may concern every or any o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> them according to this our Will and Pleasure hereby signified and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed.</q>
No other Power required to confirm these Canons, or to impose them on the People but the Kings alone. And yet I trow there are not a few par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, in which those Canons doe extend, to the propertie and persons of such Refusers as are concerned in the same; which our Author may soon finde in them
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61668:80"/>
if he list to look. And having so done, let him give us the like Precedent for his Houses of Parliament (either abstractedly in themselves, or in cooperation with the King) in confirming Canons; and we shall gladly quit the cause, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly submit to his <note n="*" place="margin">I bilieve this should be <hi>bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rata.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the page is mistaken, 121, for 101, I dare not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it.</note> ter judgement.</p>
                  <p>But if it be objected, as perhaps it may, That the Subsidies granted by the Clergy in the Convocation, are ratified and confirmed by Act of Parliament, before they can be levied either on the Granters themselves, or the rest of the Clergy.</p>
                  <p>I answer, that this makes nothing to our Authors purpose, that is to say, that <hi>the person or property of Refusers should not be subjected to temporal penalty, without consent of Parliament.</hi> For first, before the submission of the Clergy to King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the 8. they granted Subsidies and other aids unto the King in their Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and levied them upon the persons concerned therein, by no other way than the usual Censures of the Church, especially by Suspension and deprivation, if any <hi>Refuser</hi> prove so refractary as to dispute the payment of the sum imposed. And by this way they gave and levied that great sum of an Hundred thousand pounds in the Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> onely; by which they bought their peace of the said King <hi>Henry,</hi> at such time as he had caused them to be attainted in the <hi>Praemunire.</hi> And secondly, there is a like Precedent for it since the said <hi>Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> For whereas the Clergy in their Convocation in the year 1585. being the 27 year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> had given that Queen a Subsidy of four sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y gave her at the same time (finding their former gift too short for her present occasions) a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence</hi> of two shillings in the pound to be raised upon all the Clergy, by virtue of their own Synodical Act onely, under the penalty of such Ecclesiastical Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures as before were mentioned. Which precedent was after followed by the Clergy in their Convocation, <hi>An</hi> 1640. the Instrument of the Grant being the same <hi>verbatim</hi> with that before; though so it hapned (such influence have the times on the Actions of men) that they were quarreld and condemned for it by the following Parliament in the time of the King, and not so much as checkt at, or thought to have gone beyond their bounds in the time of the Queen. And for the ratifying of their Bill by Act of Parliament, it came up first at such times (after the Submission before mentioned) as the Kings of <hi>England</hi> being in distrust of their Clergy, did not think fit to impower them by their Letters Patents for the making of any Synodical Acts, Canons or Constitutions whatsoever, by which their Subsidies have been levied in former times, but put them off to be confirmed and made Obligatory by Act of Parliament. Which being afterwards found to be the more expedite way, and not considered as derogatory to the Churches Rights, was followed in succeeding times without doubt or scruple; the Church proceeding in all other Cases by her native power, even in Cases where both the persons and property of the Subject were alike concerned, as by the Canons 1603, 1640, and many of those past in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time (though not so easie to be seen) doth at full appear. Which said, we may have leisure to consider of another passage relating not unto the Power of the Church, but the wealth of the Churchmen. Of which thus our Author.</p>

                  <p>I conceived it Civil to suffer the Animadvertor (to use his own phrase) <hi>parler le tout, to speak all out</hi> in this long Discourse; which, although it consisteth of <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Notes,</hi> yet because all treat of the same subject, and because a <hi>Relative strength</hi> might result thereby to the whole, I have presented it intire: Yet when all is said, I finde very little I have learnt thereby, and lesse (if any thing) which I am to alter.</p>
                  <p>These my two <hi>preparatory Rules</hi> (as the Animadvertor terms them) I have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <hi>stated,</hi> and proved, and here intend no repetition.</p>
                  <p>It is no <hi>Beame,</hi> and but a <hi>Moat-fault</hi> at most, if I have dated the submission of <hi>the Clergy to the King,</hi> not from the first private performance, but the passing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:61668:81"/>
into Print and publique cognisance. Thus the Age of Children are by their Parents reckoned from their <hi>birth,</hi> but by others from their <hi>entrance in the Register.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the main fault (and that a foul one, if true) layed to my charge is, for <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Authority of Church, and subjecting it to the power of Parliaments.</hi> But know it is past the might and spight of the most malicious man <hi>finally</hi> to weaken the <hi>just Authority</hi> of the Church, God having solemnly promised <hi>That the Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it.</hi> Yet Princes (as King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth did) might <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trence</hi> the Power of the <hi>Church</hi> (or ambitious <hi>Church-men</hi> rather) when they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded the just priviledges of others.</p>
                  <p>I shall onely return a few plain and general answers to what is objected. First, before I entred on the <hi>difficult Subject</hi> of <hi>Synods</hi> and <hi>Convocations</hi> (before and since the <hi>Clergies Submission</hi>) <hi>with their respective powers,</hi> I <hi>placed,</hi> as followeth,
<q>
                        <bibl>Church-History, Book <hi>1.</hi> pag. <hi>191.</hi>
                        </bibl>
                        <p>This I humbly conceive to be the difference betwixt the three kindes of Convocations, submitting what I have written, to the censure and correction of the learned in the Law, conscious of my own ignorance therein, as indeed such skill neither is to be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted or required in one of my profession, who am ready with willingnesse, yea with chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse, yea with thankfulnesse to God and man publickly to recall and retract what any such convince me to have mistaken herein; hoping that my stumbling in so dark a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, may prevent the failing of others.</p>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus humbly <hi>desired</hi> (I say not <hi>deserved</hi>) favour, I hope it will be indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged unto me.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I presume to tender this (I hope reasonable) motion to the Reader, that seeing the Animadvertor not onely freely confesseth this Subject to be an <hi>intricate Labyrinth,</hi> but also fairly acknowledgeth, <hi>that he findeth the Positions I maintain</hi> in <hi>SOME OTHER AUTHORS,</hi> that I may be <hi>discharged,</hi> and that the guilt (if any) may be derived on such <hi>Authors</hi> as have misguided me.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, When I use the word <hi>Parliament,</hi> it expoundeth it self what was meant thereby (capable in that age of no other comment) <hi>viz. The aggregation of the King, Lords, and Commons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I distinguish betwixt a <hi>consultive, conclusive,</hi> and <hi>punitive</hi> power in matters of Religion. The <hi>consultive power</hi> God hath intrusted his <hi>Church</hi> with, and the Clergy as the Representative thereof. The <hi>conclusive power</hi> also is inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in them, so far forth as to declare what is <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and what <hi>Heretical.</hi> But the <hi>punitive power</hi> (especially when exceeding Church Censors) and extending to Life, Limb, and Estate, is in the <hi>Parliament</hi>; that so neither <hi>Royal Prerogative</hi> nor <hi>Subjects Right</hi> may be injured.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, I distinguish betwixt the power which the <hi>Convocation</hi> had over the <hi>Clergy,</hi> and what they have over the Laity. Over the Estates of the latter, they have no power.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Clergy,</hi> they are all represented, by their voluntary elections, in their <hi>Clerks</hi> or <hi>Proctors: Volenti non fit injuria, A man that is willing is not wronged.</hi> What summes therefore they give away of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> they may be presumed impowred therein, with the consent of the <hi>Clergy.</hi> However, to clear all doubts, the consent of Parliament hath [since the <hi>Submission of the Clergy</hi>] been required unto it.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>black Swan</hi> in the reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> I mean that <hi>single</hi> and <hi>signal</hi> instance of tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Unparliament-impowred-Convocation,</hi> which gave that <hi>suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Subsidie</hi> to Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; I humbly conceive that the <hi>popularity</hi> of so peerlesse a Princesse, the <hi>necessity</hi> of her occasions, and the <hi>tranquilitie</hi> of those times (a happinesse denyed in our Age) made that <hi>unquestioned,</hi> which might be <hi>questionable</hi> if any <hi>turbulent Clergy-man</hi> had proved <hi>recusant</hi> in payment.</p>
                  <p>As to the Convocation 1640. let me request the Reader, that I may without danger humbly tender my opinion therein.

                  <p>Our Author proceeds. Fol. 253. <hi>I have heard</hi> (saith he) <hi>that</hi> Queen Elizabeth <hi>being informed that</hi> Dr. Pilkington Bishop <hi>of</hi> Durham <hi>had given ten thousand pounds in marriage with his Daughter; and being offended that a Prelates daughter should equall a Princesse in Portion, took away one thousand pounds a year from that Bishoprick, and assigned it for the better maintenance of the Garrison of</hi> Barwick.] In telling of which story our Author commits many mistakes, as in most things else. For first to justifie the Queens displeasure (if she were displeased) he makes the Bishop richer, and the Portion greater than indeed they were. The ten thousand pounds <hi>Lib</hi> 9 <hi>fol.</hi> 109. being shrunk to eight; and that eight thousand pound not given to one Daughter (as is here affirmed) but divided equally between two: whereof the one was married to Sir <hi>Iames Harrington,</hi> the other unto <hi>Dunch</hi> of <hi>Berkshire.</hi> Secondly, this could be no cause of the Queens displeasure, and much lesse of the Countries envie; that Bishop having sat in the See of <hi>Durham</hi> above seventeen years. And certainly he must needs have been a very <hi>ill Husband</hi> if out of such a great Revenue he had not saved five hundred pounds <hi>per annum</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his Children; the income being as great, and the charges of Hospility lesse than they have been since. Thirdly, the Queen did not take away a thousand pound a year from that Bishoprick, as is here affirmed. The Lands were left to it as before, but in regard the Garrison of <hi>Barwick</hi> preserved the Bishops Lands and Tenants from the spoil of the <hi>Scots</hi>; the Queen thought fit, that the Bishops should contribute towards their own defence, imposing on them an annual pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of a thousand pound for the better maintaining of that Garrison. Fourthly, Bishop <hi>Pilkington</hi> was no <hi>Doctor,</hi> but a Batchelor of Divinity onely; and possibly had not been raised by our Author to an higher title and Degree than the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity had given him, but that he was a <hi>Conniver at Non-conformity,</hi> as our Author
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61668:82"/>
telleth us <hi>Lib.</hi> 9. <hi>fol.</hi> 109. Lastly, I shall here add, that I conceived the Pension above mentioned, not to have been laid upon that See after <hi>Pilkingtons</hi> death, but on his first preferment to it, the <hi>French</hi> having then newly landed some forces in <hi>Scotland,</hi> which put the Queen upon a necessity of doubling her Guards and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing her Garrisons. But whatsoever was the cause of imposing this great yearly payment upon that Bishoprick, certain I am, that it continued, and the money was duly paid into the Exchequer for many years, after the true cause thereof was taken away; the Queens displeasure against <hi>Pilkington</hi> ending either with his life or hers, and all the Garrisons and forces upon the Borders being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away in the beginning of the Reign of King <hi>Iames.</hi> So true is that old saying, <hi>Quod Christus non capit, fiscus rapit</hi>; never more fully verified than in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</p>

<q>That it shall be lawfull for all people in time of Harvest, to labour upon Holy and Festival dayes, and save that thing which God hath sent, and that scrupulosity to abstain from working on those dayes doth grievously offend God.

Our Author follows this Design of putting matters of Religion into the power of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> though he hath chosen a very ill <hi>Medium</hi> to conclude the point. This Parliament as active as he seems to make it, troubled it self so little with matters of Religion, that had it done lesse, it had done just nothing. All that it did, was the Repealing of some Acts made in the time of Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and setling matters in the same State in which she found them at her first coming to the Crown. The Common Prayer Book being reviewed and fitted to the use of the Church by some godly men, appointed by the Queen alone, receiv'd no other confirmation in this present Parliament, than what it had before in the last years of King <hi>Edward.</hi> The Supremacy was again restor'd, as it had been formerly; the Title of Supreme head, which seem'd offensive unto many of both Religions, being changed into that of Supreme Governor, nothing in all this done <hi>de novo,</hi> which could intitle this Parliament to such activity in matters of Religion, but that our Author had a minde to undervalue the <hi>Convocation,</hi> as being <hi>little imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and lesse regarded.</hi> I grant indeed, that the <hi>Convocation</hi> of that year did only meet for forms sake, without acting any thing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>In the mean time I would fain know our Authors Reason, why speaking of the <hi>Convocation</hi> and the <hi>Parliament</hi> in the notion of Twins, the <hi>Convocation</hi> must be made the younger Brother. Assuredly there had been Convocations in the Church of <hi>England</hi> some hundreds of years before the name of Parliament had been ever heard of; which he that lists to read the collection of Councels pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished by that learned and industrious Gentleman Sir <hi>Henry Spelman,</hi> cannot but perceive.</p>

                  <p>I confesse <hi>Convocations</hi> in their <hi>general notion</hi> more ancient, and <hi>regular,</hi> and completely constituted than <hi>Parliaments:</hi> Yet of these <hi>Twins,</hi> I called the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> the younger Brother properly enough.</p>
                  <p>First, Because modern Convocations, as modelled since the submission of the Clergy to <hi>Henry the eighth,</hi> are many years junior to Parliaments.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Convocations alwaies began the day after the Parliament, the Archbishops and Bishops alwaies attending the King the first day in Parliament.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, The <hi>Parliament</hi> hath made a <hi>younger Brother</hi> of the Convocation: And there being a priority in Power, he in effect is the Heir and elder Brother, who confineth the other to a poor pittance and small portion as our Age can well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member.</p>

                  <p>Our Author proceeds. Fol. 71. <hi>This year the spire of</hi> Poles-<hi>steeple, covered with lead, strangely fell on fire.</hi>] More modestly in this than when he formerly ascribes the burning of some great <hi>Abbeys</hi> to <hi>Lightning from Heaven.</hi> And so this steeple was both reported and believed to be fired also, it being an ordinary thing in our common Almanacks, till these latter times, to count the time (among the other Epoches of Computation) from the year that St. <hi>Paul</hi>-steeple was fired with Lightning.

                  <p>But the <hi>literal</hi> and <hi>Grammatical sense</hi> is worded in so <hi>favourable</hi> and <hi>receptive terms,</hi> that two <hi>opposite parties</hi> (both well<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And one may read in the works of <hi>King Iames,</hi> that on this account he highly commendeth the discretion and moderation of the Composers of our Articles.</p>

                  <p>They had not otherwise attained to the end they aimed at, which was <hi>ad tollen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam opinionum dissensionem, &amp; consensum in vera Religione firmandum</hi>; that is to say, to take away diversitie of Opinions, and to establish an agreement in the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Which end could never be effected, if men were left unto the <hi>liberty of dissenting,</hi> or might have leave to put their own sense upon the Articles. But whereas our instances in the <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Christs descent into Hell,</hi> telling us that <hi>Christs preaching unto the Spirits there</hi> (on which the Article seemed to be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in King <hi>Edwards</hi> Book) was left out in this; and thereupon inferreth, that men are left unto a <hi>latitude concerning the cause, time, manner of his discent</hi>; I must needs say, that he is very much mistaken. For first the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> hath
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61668:90"/>
alwaies constantly maintained a <hi>local Descent,</hi> though many which would be thought her Children, the better to comply with <hi>Calvin</hi> and some other Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines of forain Nations, have deviated in this point from the sense of the Church. And secondly, the reason why this Convocation left out that passage of Christ preaching to the spirits in hell; was not, that men might be left unto a <hi>latitude</hi> concerning the <hi>cause, time,</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of his <hi>Descent,</hi> as our Author dreams; but because that passaage of St. <hi>Peter</hi> being capable of some other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations, was not conceived to be a clear and sufficient evidence to prove the Article.

                  <p>I cannot fully concur with the Animadvertor, That the <hi>Church of England hath constantly maintained</hi> a <hi>LOCAL DESCENT,</hi> though no man hath an higher esteem for those worthy Writers who are of that perswasion.</p>
                  <p>I will confess this hitherto hath staggered me, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> his application of <hi>Davids</hi> words to Christ,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 2.27.</note> 
                     <hi>thou shalt not leave my soul in hel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I appeal whether these words import not a favour to all unprejudiced hearers, which God did to his Son, bearing this natural and unviolated sense, <hi>That had God left Christs soul in hell, his soul had been in a bad condition, as being there in a suffering capacity, but Gods Paternal affection to his dear Son, would not leave his soul in hell,</hi> but did rescue it thence.</p>
                  <p>Now all our Protestant, and especially English Writers, who maintain a <hi>LOCAL DESCENT,</hi> doe very worthily (in opposition to the <hi>Romish Error</hi>) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, that Christ was then in a good estate, yea in a <hi>triumphing</hi> condition.</p>
                  <p>Now then, it had been no favour not to leave his soul in <hi>Hell,</hi> but a less love unto him, to contract his happiness in his triumph.</p>
                  <p>I protest, that in this or any other point, I am not possest with a spirit of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position; and when I am herein satisfied in any good degree, I shall become the Animadvertors thankful Convert in this particular.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, I am confident, That there needs no other answer to these notes, then the distinct and serious perusal of my <hi>Church History,</hi> with the due altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of favour indulged to all writings.</p>

                  <p>And well had it been for the peace and happiness of the Church, if the <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madvertor</hi> (and all of his Party) had had as high an esteem as the <hi>Author</hi> hath, for the Homilies, If none of them had called them <hi>HOMELY HOMILIES,</hi> (as one did,) And if they had conformed their practise to the second Homilie in the second Book, and not appeared so forward in countenancing Images of God and his Saints in Churches.</p>

                  <p>The Author proceeds. Fol. 76. <hi>The English Bishops conceiving themselves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred by their Canons, began to shew their authority, in urging the Clergy of their Diocess to subscribe to the Liturgy, Ceremonies and Discipline of the Church, and such as refused the same, were branded with the odious name of Puritans.</hi>] Our Author having given the Parliament a power of confirming no Canons, as before was shewed, he brings the Bishops acting by as weak Authority in the years 1563. &amp; 1564. there being at that time no Canons for them to proceed upon for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring their Clergy to <hi>subscribe to the Liturgies, Ceremonies, and Discipline of the Church</hi>: And therefore if they did any such thing, it was not as they were <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powred by their Canons,</hi> but as they were inabled by that Authority which was inherent naturally in their Episcopal Office.</p>

                  <p>I profess my self not to understand the sense of the Animadvertor, and what he driveth at herein. And as soon as I shall understand him, I will either fully concur with him, or fairly dissent from him, rendring my reason for the same.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Genebrards</hi> placing the beginning of the Name Puritan, <hi>about two years</hi> after, intimates a latitude in his Computation.</p>

                  <p>Where have I declared my self for a Presbyterian in point of Government? who never scattered sylable, (and if I did, I would snatch it up again) to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance such presumption.</p>
                  <p>I confess I said, That Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> was made Minister or Priest by the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery at <hi>Antwerp</hi>; that is, made Minister so far forth as they could give, and he receive the Ministerial Character, who never had it otherwise impressed upon him.</p>
                  <p>Suppose a <hi>disputable power should dub a Knight</hi>

                     </gap> Might not a Historian say such a man was made a Knight by such a power of person, not engaging himself to justifie his Authority that made him? And by the same proportion, I relating Mr. <hi>Travers</hi> made Minister at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> am not concerned to justifie, nor by my expression doe I any way approve their <hi>Minister-making,</hi> if they have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission thereunto.</p>
                  <p>I cannot close with the Animadvertor in his uncharitable censure of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistery</hi> of forain Protestant Churches, rendring them utterly invalid, because ordained by no Bishops. <hi>Cain</hi> (as commonly believed) is conceived to have killed a fourth part of mankinde by murthering <hi>Abel</hi>; but the Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors cruelty to Protestants hath exceeded this proportion, in spiritually killing more than a fourth part of Protestants, according to his own principles: For if no Priests in <hi>France, Low Countries, Swisserland,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>then no Sacraments; then no Church; then no Salvation.</hi>

Bishop Andrews when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred with others of his own order, in ordaining a Scotishman Bishop, who (as by proportion of time may be demonstrated) received his <hi>Deaconship</hi> and <hi>Prist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> from the Presbytery, conceived such ordination of validity <hi>when done</hi>; though I beleeve in his judgement, not so well approving the doing thereof: Otherwise he would never have consented to make a <hi>meer Lay man, per saltum,</hi> a Bishop.</p>

Neither the King nor any of his Good Subjects, in what Realm soever, can live in safety. <hi>Gods Honour</hi> and the <hi>preaching of his Truth</hi> are two such pretences, as will make void all Laws, elude all Oaths, and thrust out all Covenants and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, be they what they will.</p>

                  <p>I behold this <hi>Note</hi> as <hi>impertinent</hi> to that place, seeing it appears not in the Text, that those <hi>wise men</hi> made <hi>Herod</hi> any promise to return unto him. Secondly, Had they made him any promise, yea bound it with an <hi>Oath by the living God,</hi> such an <hi>Oath</hi> had not been <hi>obligatory,</hi> because God (to whom the <hi>forfeiture</hi> was due) <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leased</hi> the <hi>Band</hi> in an extraordinary Vision, unto them such, that our Age doth not produce.</p>

There was a time when the Chancellors (as our Author telleth us elsewhere) were alwaies Bishops; and from that time till the fall of Cardinal <hi>Wolsey,</hi> that Office continued for the most part in the hands of the Prelates: at what time, that great Office was discharged with such a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral contentment, that people found more expedition in their Suits, and more ease to their purses than of later times. By which it seems that men who are <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bred to know the true grounds and reasons of the Common Law,</hi> might and could mitigate the rigor of it in such difficult cases as were brought before them; the Chancery not having in those dayes such a mixture of Law as now it hath, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so tyed up to such intricate Rules as now it is.</p>

                  <p>I have nothing to return in opposition to the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> in his endeavouring to make a <hi>Clergy-man</hi> proper to be <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> as, <hi>as well qualified As any Common-Lawyer for the Place.</hi> Nor if I could, would I disprove what tendeth to the Honour of my Profession. The <hi>little toe</hi> is advanced when the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61668:96"/>
                     <hi>Head</hi> is Crowned, as a Member of the same Body; and my meannesse is sensible of some honour, that any of my Calling are put in a capacity of so high a Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Onely I request, that if the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> be advanced to the Place, and if I have a cause brought before him, that he would be pleased to hear it <hi>cum omni favore</hi> on this consideration, that he put me to much trouble in answering his <hi>caus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse Cavils</hi> against my <hi>Church-History.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Give me leave to add, that I suspect the <hi>Common-Lawyers</hi> will take advantage from the last words of the Animadvertor, confessing the Court of Chancery now more <hi>intricated</hi> and <hi>mingled</hi> with Law, than in former Ages. Hence I fear they will infer, that <hi>Clergy-men</hi> (though they were heretofore) will not hereafter be so able and fit to discharge that Office. But let us proceed.</p>

                  <p>But thirdly, whereas our Author in advocating for the Common Lawyers, prescribeth for them a Succession of six Descents, he hath therein confuted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and saved me the trouble of an Animadversion, by a Marginal Note; in which he telleth us, that <hi>Sir Ch. Hatton was not bred a Lawyer.</hi> If so, then neither was the <hi>Title</hi> so <hi>strong,</hi> nor the Proscriptions so well grounded as our Author makes it; the interposition of Sir <hi>Christopher Hatton</hi> between Sir <hi>Tho.

Because, saith he, <hi>fol.</hi> 112. <hi>they demanded such unreasonable liberty in education of the Loyal Offspring, and other Priviledges for English Priests, &amp;c.</hi>] If this be all, it signifies as much as nothing.

Our Author cannot be so great a stranger in the shops of <hi>London,</hi> as not to know that <hi>Trades-men</hi> use to ask many times twice as much for a Commodity, as they mean to take; and therefore may conclude as strongly, that they doe not mean to sell those wares for which they ask such an unreasonable price at the first demand. <hi>Iniquum petere, ut aequum obtineas,</hi> hath been the usual practise (especially in driving State-bargains) or all times and ages.

                  <p>Ibid. <hi>Whereupon King</hi> James <hi>not onely broke off all Treaty with</hi> Spain, <hi>but also called the great Councel of his Kingdom together.</hi>] By which it seems, that the breaking off of the Treaty did precede the Parliament. But <hi>multa apparent quae non sunt,</hi> every is not as it seems. The Parliament in this case came before, by whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual importunity and solicitation, the breach of the Treaties followed after. The King lov'd peace too well to lay aside the Treaties, and engage in War before he was desparate of successe any other way than by that of the Sword, as was assur'd both of the hands and hearts of his subjects to assist him in it.

The Priests who came over with the Queen were by agreement to be all of the <hi>Oratorian</hi> Order, as less suspected by the English, whom they had never provok'd, as had the <hi>Iesuits,</hi> (and most other of the Monastick Orders) by their mischie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous practises. But these <hi>Oratorians</hi> being sent back with the rest of the French, <hi>Anno,</hi> 1626. and not willing to expose themselves to the hazard of a second expulsion, the <hi>Capuchins,</hi> under <hi>Father Ioseph,</hi> made good the place. The breach with <hi>France,</hi> the action at the Isle of <hi>Rhee,</hi> and the losse of <hi>Rochel,</hi> did all occur, before the <hi>Capuchins</hi> were thought of, or admitted hither. And thirdly, some years after the making of the Peace between the Crowns, (which was in the latter end of 1628. and not before) the Queen obtain'd, that these Friers might have leave to come over to her, some lodgings being fitted for them in <hi>Somerset-house,</hi> and a new Chappel then and there built for her Devotion.</p>

                  <p>Our Author proceeds, f. 121. <hi>The Bishop of</hi> Lincoln, Lord Keeper, <hi>was now daily descendant in the Kings favour; who so highly distasted him, that he would not have him, as Dean of</hi> Westm. <hi>to perform any part of his Coronation.</hi>] As little truth in this as in that before. For first, the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> was not <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> at the time of the Coronation. Secondly, if he had been so, and that the King was so distasted with him, as not to suffer him to assist at his Coronation; how came he to be suffered to be present at it in the capacity of Lord Keeper? For that he did so, is affirmed by our Author, saying, <hi>That the King took a scrowl of parchment out of his bosome, and gave it to the Lord Keeper</hi> Williams, <hi>who read it to the Commons four severall times, East, West, North, and South,</hi> fol. 123. Thirdly, the Lord Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, who read that Scrole, was not the Lord Keeper <hi>VVilliams,</hi> but the Lord Keeper <hi>Coventry</hi>; the Seal being taken from the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the custody of Sir <hi>Thomas Coventry,</hi> in <hi>October</hi> before. And therefore fourthly, our Author is much out, in placing both the Coronation, and the following Parliament, before the change of the Lord Keeper; and sending Sir <hi>Iohn Suckling</hi> to fetch that Seal, at the end of a Parliament in the Spring, which he had brought away with him before <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term. But as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was willing to keep the Bishop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> in the Deanry of <hi>Westminster,</hi> for no less then five or six years after it was confer'd on another; so is he as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to continue him Lord Keeper for as many months, after the Seal had been entrusted to another hand.</p>

                  <p>My Heraldry is right both in Place and Time. The Earl of <hi>Arundel,</hi> as <hi>Earl Marshall,</hi> went after the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> as Lord <hi>High Constable,</hi> though going before him. For <hi>Barons</hi> went (in this Royall Procession, at the Kings Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronation) before <hi>Bishops, Bishops</hi> before <hi>Viscounts, Viscounts</hi> before <hi>Earls,</hi> the <hi>meaner</hi> before the <hi>greater</hi> Officers of State. Thus the Lord Constable (though the <hi>last</hi>) was the <hi>first,</hi> because, of all Subjects, nearest to the person of the Soveraign. It seemeth the dayes were very long when the Animadvertor wrote these causless cavills, which being now grown very short, I cannot af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford so much time in confuting them.</p>
                  <p>This his cavilling mindeth me, of what he hath mistaken in his Geography. For, the younger son of an English Earl comming to <hi>Geneva,</hi> desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a <hi>Carp</hi> for his dinner, having read in the Doctor's Geography, that the <hi>Lemman Lake</hi> had plenty of the Fish, and the best and biggest of that kind. The people wondred at his desire of such a dainty, which that place did not afford; but told him, That they had <hi>Trouts</hi> as good and great, as any in <hi>Europe.</hi> Indeed, learned <note n="*" place="margin">

to depart from it.

                  <p>And this I call piece of new <hi>State-Doctrine,</hi> never known before, because I find the contrary in the Coronation of our former Kings. For in the form and manner of the Coronation of King <hi>Edward</hi> 6. described in the <hi>Catalogue of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> set forth by <hi>Thomas Mills</hi> of <hi>Canterbury, Anno</hi> 1610. we find in thus.
<q>The King being carried by certain noble Courtiers in another Chair, unto the four sides of the Stage, was by the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> declared unto the people (standing round about) both by Gods and Mans Lawes, to be the right and lawfull King of <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and proclaimed that day to be Crowned, Consecrated, and Annointed: unto whom he deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, Whether they would obey and serve, or not? By whom it was again with a loud cry answered, God save the King, and, Ever live his Majesty.</q>
The same we have in substance, but in fewer words, in the Coronation of King <hi>Iames,</hi> where it is said, that
<q>The King was shewed to the People, and that they were required to make acknowledgement of their allegiance to his Majesty by the Arch-Bishop; which they did by acclamations.</q>
Assuredly, the difference is exceeding vast betwixt <hi>obeying</hi> and <hi>consenting</hi>; betwixt the Peoples <hi>acknowledging their alliegance and promising to obey and serve their lawfull Soveraign,</hi> and <hi>giving their consent</hi> to his Coronation, as if it could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without such <hi>consent.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>I refer my self wholly in this difference to the <hi>Arbitration</hi> of Mr. <hi>Mills,</hi> the same <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Edition</hi> cited by the <hi>Animadvertor,</hi> who speaking of the <hi>anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent form</hi> of the <hi>Coronation</hi> of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in reference to this passage, thus expresseth himself.</p>

                  <p>I am less able (if it should be true) to commend it in him. It is not certainly the office of a carefull Bishop, onely to leave things as he found them, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them, if amiss, to those Rules and Canons, from which, by the forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of some to innovate, and the connivance of others at the innovations, they had been suffered to decline.</p>

                  <p>And it is possible enough, that the practices which he speaks of, were not <hi>private</hi> neither, but a reviver of those antient and publick usages, which the Canons of the Church enjoyned, and by the remisness of the late Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been discontinued. But for a justification of the practises (the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate practises he speaks of) I shall refer him to an Author of more credit with him. Which Author, first, tells us of the Bishops generally,
<q>That being of late years either careless or indulgent, they had not required, within their Diocesses, that strict obedience to Ecclesiasticall Constitutions, which the Law expected; upon which, the Liturgy began totally to be laid aside, and inconformity the uniform practise of the Church. He tells us, secondly, of Arch-Bishop <hi>Abbot</hi> in particular, That his extraordinary remisness, in not exacting a strict conformity to the prescribed orders of the Church, in point of Ceremony, seemed to dissolve those legall determinations, to their first principle of indifferency, and led in such an habit of inconformity, as the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reduction of those tender conscienced mens too-long-discontinued obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, was interpreted an innovation. And finally, he tells of Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> who succeeded <hi>Abbot</hi> in that See, that, being of another mind and met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, he did not like, that the externall Worship of God should follow the fashion of every private fancy; and what he did not like in that subject, as he was in State, so he thought it was his duty to reform. To which end, in his Metropoliticall Visitation, he calls upon all, both Clergy and Laity, to observe the Rules of the Church.</q>
And this is that which our Author calls, the <hi>enjoyning of his private practises; private</hi> perhaps in the <hi>private opinion</hi> of some men, who had declared themselves to be professed enemies to all publick Order.</p>

                  <p>When the <hi>Writing</hi> for <hi>Arch-Bishop Abbot's suspension</hi> was to be <hi>subscribed</hi> by the <hi>Bishops</hi> aforesaid, the four <hi>Seniors,</hi> viz. <hi>London, Durham, Rochester,</hi> and <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> all declined to set their <hi>hands</hi> thereunto, and (seemingly at the least) shewed much <hi>reluctance</hi> and <hi>regrete</hi> thereat.

                  <p>Did I not foretell aright, that my <hi>rectification</hi> would cost me dear? even the burden of bad words.

                  <p>For if by <hi>Legislative power,</hi> he means a power of making Lawes, as the word doth intimate, then it is true, That the Canons of forrain Councells had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any such power within this Land: But if by <hi>Legislative power</hi> he means, a Power or Capability of passing for Lawes within this Kingdom; then (though he use the word improperly) it is very fals) that no such Canons were in force in the Realm of <hi>England.</hi> The Canons of many forrain Councells, <hi>Generall, Nationall,</hi> and <hi>Provinciall,</hi> had been received in this Church, and incorporated into the body of the Canon-Law, by which the Church proceeded in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of her Jurisdiction, till the submission of the Clergy to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth. And, in the Act confirmative of that submission, it is said expresly,
<q>That all Canons, Constitutions, Ordinances, and Synodals Provinciall, as were made before the said Submission, which be not contrary or repugnant to the Laws, Statutes, and Customs of this Realm, nor to the dammage or hurt of the Kings Prerogative Royall, were to be used and executed as in former times, 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 19.</q>
So that unlesse it can be proved, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in this case, <hi>by the Canons of forrain Councels</hi> was either <hi>contrary or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Laws and Customs of the Realm, or to the dammage of the Kings pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative Royall,</hi> There is no dangerous consequence at all to be found therein.</p>

                  <p>By <hi>Legislative power</hi> of the <hi>Canons</hi> of <hi>forrain Councels,</hi> I understand their power to subject the <hi>People</hi> of our <hi>Nation</hi> to <hi>Guiltiness,</hi> and consequently to <hi>Penalties,</hi> if found infringing them. Now I say again, such forrain <hi>Canons,</hi> though not <hi>against,</hi> but onely <hi>besides</hi> our <hi>Common Law</hi>; and containing no <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnancy,</hi> but <hi>disparateness</hi> to the <hi>Lawes</hi> of our <hi>Land</hi>; either never had such
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61668:105"/>
                     <hi>power</hi> in <hi>England</hi> since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> or else disuse long since hath antiquated it, as to the rigid exercise thereof.</p>
                  <p>For instance, a <hi>Bishop</hi> I am sure, and I think a <hi>Priest</hi> too, is, in the old <hi>Canons,</hi> rendred <hi>irregular,</hi> for playing a <hi>game at Tables, Dice</hi> being forbidden by the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons.</hi> Yet I conceive, it would be hard measure, and a thing, <hi>de facto,</hi> never done, that such <hi>irregularity</hi> should be charged on him, on that account.</p>
                  <p>We know it was the project of the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Papall party,</hi> to <hi>multiply Canons</hi> in <hi>Councels,</hi> meerly to make <hi>the more men,</hi> and <hi>men the more obnoxious</hi> unto him, that they might re-purchase their innocence at the <hi>price</hi> of the <hi>Court</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> I believe, the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> himself would be loth to have his <hi>canonicalness</hi> tried by the Test of all <hi>old Canons,</hi> made in <hi>rigorem disciplinae,</hi> yet not contrariant to our <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Customs,</hi> seeing they are so nice and numerous, that <hi>Cautiousnesse</hi> it self may be found an <hi>offendor</hi> therein. I resume my words, That it would be of dangerous consequence to condemn the <hi>Arch-Bishop</hi> by <hi>Canons</hi> of <hi>forrain Councels,</hi> which never obtained power here, either <hi>quoad reatum,</hi> or <hi>poenam,</hi> of such as did not observe them.</p>

                  <p>Far more mistaken is our Author in the next, when he tells us, fol. 128. <hi>Though this Arch-bishop survived some years after, yet hence-forward he was buried to the world.</hi>] No such matter neither: For, though for a while he stood confined to his house at <hi>Ford,</hi> yet neither this <hi>Confinement,</hi> nor that <hi>Commission,</hi> were of long continuance; for about <hi>Christmas,</hi> in the year 1628. he was restored both to his Liberty and Jurisdiction, sent for to come unto the <hi>Court,</hi> received as he came out of his Barge by the Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Dorset,</hi> and by them conducted to the King; who giving him his hand to kiss, enjoyned him not to fail the Councill-Table twice a vveek. After which time we find him sitting as Arch-Bishop in Parliament, and in the full exercise of his <hi>Iuris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction</hi> till the day of his death, which happened on <hi>Sunday, August</hi> the 4th. 1633.

                  <p>Our Author goeth on. Fol. 137. <hi>My pen passing by them at present, may safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Salute them with a God-Speed as neither seeing nor suspecting any danger in the Designe</hi>] Our Author speakes this of the <hi>Feoffees,</hi> appointed by themselves, for buying<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>in such Impropriations, as were then in the hands of Lay-persons. I say, appointed by themselves; because not otherwise authorised, either by Charter from the King, Decree in Chancery, or by Act of Parliament; but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a secret combination of the Brother-hood.</p>
                  <p>But secondly, this will further appear by their proceedings in the businesse, not laying the Impropriations, by them purchased, to the Church or Chappelry to which they had antiently belonged, nor setling them on the Incumbent of the place, as many hoped they would. That had been utterly destructive to their main design, which was not to advantage the Regular and established Clergy, but to set up a new body of <hi>Lecturers</hi> in convenient places, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of the <hi>Cause.</hi> And therefore having bought an Impropriation, they parcelled it out into annual Pensions of 40 or 50 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> and therewith salared some Lecturers in such Market-Towns, where the people had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly lesse to do, and consequently were more apt to Faction and Innovation, than in other places. Our Author notes it of their Predecessors, in <hi>Cartwrights</hi> dayes, that they preached most diligently in <hi>populous places; it being observed in</hi> England, <hi>that those who hold the</hi> Helm <hi>of the</hi> Pulpit, <hi>alwayes steer peoples hearts as they please, Lib.</hi> 9. <hi>fol.</hi> 195. And he notes it also of these <hi>Feoffees,</hi> that in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity hereunto, they set up a Preaching Ministry in places of greatest need; not in such Parish-Churches, to which the Tithes properly belonged, but where they thought the Word was most wanting, that is to say, most wanting to advance their project.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if we behold the men whom they made choice of, and employed in preaching in such Market-Towns as they had an eye on, either because most populous, or because capable of electing Burgesses to serve in Parliament, they were for the most part <hi>Non-conformists,</hi> and sometime such as had been silen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by their Ordinary, or the High-commission, for their Factious carriage. And such an one was placed by <hi>Geering,</hi> one of the Citizen-Feoffees, in a Town of <hi>Glocestershire</hi>; a fellow which had been outed of a Lecture neer <hi>Sandwich</hi> by the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> out of another in <hi>Middlesex</hi> by the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> out of a third in <hi>Yorkshire</hi> by the <hi>Archbishop</hi> of <hi>York,</hi> out of a fourth in <hi>Hartfordshire</hi> by the <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and finally suspended from his Ministry by the High-Commission; yet thought the fittest man by <hi>Geering</hi> (as indeed he was) to begin this Lecture.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and finally, these Pensions neither were so setled, nor these Lectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers so well establisht in their severall places, but that the one might be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, and the other removed, at the will and pleasure of their Patrons, if they grew slack and negligent in the <hi>holy cause,</hi> or abated any thing at all of that fire and fury they first brought with them. Examples of which I know some, and have heard of more. And now I would fain know of our Author, whether there be no <hi>danger</hi> to be <hi>seen</hi> or <hi>suspected</hi> in this <hi>design</hi>; whether these Feoffees in short time would not have had more Chaplains to depend upon them, than all the Bishops in the Kingdom; and finally, whether such needy fellowes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61668:106"/>
on the will and pleasure of their gracious Masters, must not be forced to Preach such Doctrines onely as best please their Humours. And though I shall say nothing here of their giving under-hand private Pensions, not onely unto such as had been silenced or suspended in the Ecclesiasticall Courts, but many times also to their wives and Children after their decease, all issuing from this common-stock: yet others have beheld it as the greatest piece of Wit and Artifice both to encourage and encrease their Emissaries, which could be possibly devised. If, as our Author tels us, <hi>fol.</hi> 143. <hi>The Design was generally approved, and that both discreet and devout men were doleful at the ruine of so pious a Project</hi>; it was because they neither did suspect the danger, nor foresee the mischiefs, which unavoidably must have followed, if not crusht in time.</p>

                  <p>Our Author proceeds, fol. 148. <hi>However, there was no Express in this Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that the Ministers of the Parish should be pressed to the publishing.</hi>] Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor doth here change his style. He had before told us, That on the first publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing of the Declaration about lawfull Sports on the Lords Day, no <hi>Minister</hi> was, <hi>de facto,</hi> enjoyned to read it in his Parish, <hi>lib.</hi> 10. <hi>fol.</hi> 76. and here he tells us, that there was no express order in the Declaration, (when reviv'd by King <hi>Charls</hi>) that the Minister of the Parish should be prest to the publishing of it; adding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ithall, that many thought it a more proper work for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stable or Tithing-man, than it was for the Minister. But if our Author mark it well, he may easily find, that the Declaration of King <hi>Iames</hi> was commanded to be published <hi>by order from the Bishop of the Diocess, through all the Parish-Churches</hi> of his Jurisdiction. And the Declaration of King <hi>Charls</hi> to be published with like order <hi>from the severall Bishops, through all the Parish-Churches of their seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Diocesses respectively. The Bishop of the Diocess</hi> in the singular number, in the Declaration of King <hi>Iames,</hi> because it principally related to the County of <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caster The Bishops</hi> in the plurall number, in that of King <hi>Charls,</hi> because the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of it was to be extended over all the Realm. In both, the Bishops are commanded to take order for the publishing of them in their severall Parishes; and whom could they require to publish them in the Parish Churches, but the Ministers onely? The <hi>Constable</hi> is a <hi>Lay-Officer,</hi> meerly bound by his place to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the Warrants and Commands of the <hi>Iustices,</hi> but not of the <hi>Bishop.</hi> And though the Tithing-man have some relation to Church-matters, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to the Bishop, in the way of <hi>presentments</hi>; yet was he no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> bound to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute any such Commands, because not tyed by an <hi>Oath of Canonicall Obedience,</hi> as the Ministers were. So that the Bishops did no more than they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, in laying the Publication of these Declarations on the backs of the Ministers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Ministers by doing less than they were required, infring'd the Oath which they had taken, rendring themselves thereby obnoxious to all

                  <p>I said, That there was no <hi>Express order</hi> in the Declaration, that the Minister of the Parish should be <hi>pressed to the publishing of it.</hi>

                  <p>Now the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> hath done me the favour, to prove my words to be true, acknowledging the Declaration onely enjoyned, <hi>That the Bishop of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess should order the publishing thereof, through all the Parishes in his Iurisdiction</hi>: And so <hi>consequently</hi> (as the Animadvertor <hi>inferreth</hi>) the Ministers must do it. Hereby the truth of my words do appear, that there was no <hi>express command,</hi> seeing an EXPRESS, and an INFERENCE are two things of a different nature.</p>
                  <p>Whereas I said, <hi>That many thought it a more proper work for the Constable or Tithing-man, then for the Minister.</hi> There are thousands now alive which will justifie the truth thereof.

                  <p>It seems that in our Authors judgment, it was well done by the Judges for the County of <hi>Somerset,</hi> to impose upon the Ministers of that County (over whom they could challenge no authority) to publish their own Declarations against <hi>Wakes</hi> and <hi>Feasts</hi>; and that it was well done of the Ministers to obey the same, for which see <hi>fol.</hi> 147.] These Bishops are beholden to him, for giving greater power to the <hi>Iudges</hi> and <hi>Iustices</hi> over his brethren of the Clergy, then he yields to them; and as much beholden are the Clergy, for putting so many <hi>Masters</hi> over them instead of a <hi>Father.</hi> The difference of the case will not serve the turn, the King having a greater power to indulge such freedom to his Subjects, then the others could pretend unto, to restrain them from it. If he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that <hi>the Ministers are most unfit to hold the Candle, to lighten and let in licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness,</hi> as he seems to do; he must first prove, that all, or any of the sports al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of, in those Declarations, may be brought within the compass of licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness, which neither the Word of God, nor the Canons of the Christian Church, nor any Statutes of the Realm had before forbidden. Lastly, whereas he tells us, That <hi>because the Iudges had enjoyned the Ministers to read their Order in the Church, the Kings Declaration was enforced by the Bishops to be published by them in the same place.</hi>] There is no such matter.

                  <p>I did not say, The Judges <hi>did well,</hi> or <hi>did ill</hi> therein; but I said, The Judges <hi>did order,</hi> that the Ministers should publish their Declaration against <hi>Wakes</hi> and <hi>Feasts.</hi> I have not (nor can quickly procure) a copy of their order, whether it were <hi>mandatory</hi> or, <hi>by way of advice,</hi> did desire <hi>Ministers</hi> to do that, which might be advantagious to Religion.

                  <p>Now for our Authors better satisfaction in the present point, I shall lay down the judgment of one so high in his esteem, (and once in the esteem of that party too) that I conceive he will not offer to gainsay him. It is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Book, called the <hi>Holy Table, Name, and Thing,</hi> vvho resolves it thus:
<q>
                        <pb n="16" facs="tcp:61668:107"/>
                        <hi>All the commands of the King</hi> (saith he) that are not upon the first inference and illation (without any Prosyllogisms) contrary to a clear passage in the Word of God, or to an evident Sun-beam of the Law of Nature, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cisely to be obeyed. Nor is it enough to find a remote and possible inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience that may ensue therefrom; (which is the ordinary objection against the Book of Recreations) for every good subject is bound in conscience to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and rest assured, that his Prince (envi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>oned with such a Councell) will be more able to discover, and as ready to prevent any ill sequel, that may come of it, as himself possibly can be. And therefore I must not by dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying my Prince commit a certain sin, in preventing a probable but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent inconveniency.</q>
This if it were good Doctrine then, when both the Author and the Book were cryed up even to admiration, is not to be rejected as false Doctrine now; truth being constant to it selfe, not varying nor alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with the change of times.</p>

                  <p>I want no satisfaction, I thank God, in the point; and therefore the <hi>Anim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertor</hi> might have spared his pains. As an Historian, I have truly related, <hi>de facto,</hi> what vvas done; and though the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> may conjecture at my judgment in this controversie, he cannot be confident thereof by any thing I have vvritten.</p>
                  <p>All I will add is this, Because <hi>I may write the more, I will write the lesse</hi> of this subject. I have good povver to back me for the present in this controversie, and might securely express my self therein.</p>
                  <p>When my Text shall lead me in my <hi>Vocation</hi> to treat of the <hi>Observation of the Lords Day,</hi> I shall not be sparing to express my opinion therein, and will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour (God-vvilling) to justifie it. Mean time, I vvill not go out of mine own <hi>house, which is my castle</hi>; I mean, I will not be drawn out into the <hi>open field</hi> of a controversie, but keep my self under this COVER, That mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact in this difference have been truly related by me: and let the <hi>Anim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertor</hi> disprove it if he can.</p>

But it is as common with some men of the newest Religions, to adscribe Gods secret judgements to some speciall Reasons, as if they had the Key which opens into his Cabinet at their severall Girdles; as if they were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to all Consultations in the Court of Heaven, before that dreadfull Judge could inflict any temporall Punishment upon Men on Earth. Otherwise they might find the Nation guilty of too many sins, which drew down this ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, to adscribe it unto any one sin, (if a sin it were;) and rather wonder at Gods mercy, patience, and long-suffering, in deferring his punishments long, then that he inflicted them at last.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61668:108"/>
and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> (consisting most, as he saith, in <hi>Superstructures</hi>) may be comprimised: <hi>and if</hi> (to use his owne Words) <hi>the Petulancy of the Puritans on the one side, and the Pragmaticalness of the Iesuites on the other side were charmed a while, moderate men might possibly have agreed on equall tearmes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this seemeth a strange thing to me, that <hi>moderation</hi> may make <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants</hi> agree with <hi>Papists</hi> in <hi>matters Doctrinall</hi>; and cannot make <hi>Protestants</hi> agree with <hi>Protestants</hi> in <hi>matters Ceremoniall.</hi> Being the <hi>same plaister,</hi> why hath it not <hi>equall vertue</hi>; especially, the <hi>latter</hi> being the <hi>lesser wound</hi>?

                  <p>Now that no <hi>moderate man stood up in the gap</hi> to make up this <hi>breach,</hi> I can assigne no other cause, save, That God, justly offended with our Nation, had not so great a favour for it, but suffered a <hi>Pustle</hi> to <hi>fester</hi> into an <hi>Ulcer</hi>; not from any <hi>insanability</hi> in the <hi>soar,</hi> but want of <hi>seasonable Surgery</hi>; and let the guilt thereof (that the burden may be the better born) be equally divided, betwixt both parties engaged therein.</p>

                  <p>The question was about the placing of the <hi>Communion-Table,</hi> whether it ought to stand in the middle of the <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Chancel,</hi> with <hi>one end</hi> towards
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61668:108"/>
the <hi>East</hi> great <hi>Window,</hi> like a <hi>common Table</hi>; or close up to the <hi>Eastern-wall,</hi> with <hi>ends North</hi> and <hi>South,</hi> according as the <hi>Altars</hi> had been placed in the former times.

                  <p>Suppose him sitting in the Chair, the Arguments on both sides urged, and all the Audience full of expectation which side would carry it. The Moderator <hi>Fuller</hi> of old merry Tales then ordinary, thus resolves the businesse, That he had heard it commended for a great piece of wisdom in Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi>
                     <q>That wheresoever he was a Parson, a Dean, or a Bishop, he never troubled Parish, Colledge, or Diocesse, with pressing of other Ceremonies upon them, than such which he found used there before his comming thither.</q>
That King <hi>Iames</hi> finding the Archbishop of <hi>Spalato</hi> in a resolution of questioning all such Leases, as had been made by his Predecessors in the <hi>Savoy,</hi> gave him this wise counsell, <hi>Relinque res sicut eas invenisti</hi>; That he should leave things as he found them. That the said King being told by a great Person, of the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted scituation of a Chappel in Cambridge,</hi> made answer, That it did not <hi>matter how the Chappell stood, so their hearts who go thither were set aright in Gods service.</hi> But for his part, he liked better of the resolution of Dr. <hi>Prideaux,</hi> (his brother in the Chair at <hi>Oxford</hi>) who being troubled with his neighbours of <hi>Kidlington,</hi> about the setting up of a <hi>May-pole,</hi> some being for it, and some against it, thus resolved the case; <hi>You,</hi> saith he, <hi>that will have a May-pole, shall have a May-pole; And you that will have none, shall have none.</hi> And that according to that pattern, he thought best to accommodate the present Controversie to the same effect, <hi>viz.</hi> You that will have an <hi>Altar,</hi> shall set up your <hi>Altar</hi>; and you that will have a <hi>Table,</hi> shall have but a <hi>Table.</hi> Which sentence, whether it would have pleased all parties, I do somewhat doubt; but sure I am, it had not tended to the advancement of that uniformity, which was then designed.</p>

                  <p>The Animadvertor here makes a <hi>Professor's Chaire</hi>; and, having solemnly set me down therein, puts words into my mouth, and makes an Oration for me, as Moderator in the present Controversie, with a jeer to boot on the memory of the Reverend Doctor <hi>Prideaux.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <note place="margin">Psal. 1.1.</note>But know, there is another <hi>Chaire,</hi> which <hi>David</hi> calls the <hi>Chaire</hi> of the <hi>scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full</hi>; and it is to be feared, that the Animadvertor in this point is too neare sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down therein.</p>
                  <p>If I should retaliate, and accordingly place the Animadvertor in <hi>a Chair,</hi> and fit him with a <hi>Speech</hi> personating him proportionable to his principles, possibly I might render him as Ridiculous, but most of all should abuse my self and my owne profession therein.</p>
                  <p>I thank God I can, though plainly, yet pertinently enough to my purpose, speak to expresse the notions of my mind. And when God shall take speech from me, (if my reason still remain) I shall rather with <hi>Zacharias</hi> make signes for writing-tables to write in, than to have words put into my mouth, forced and seigned on me by the Animadvertor. Let him thank God that he can speak so well for himselfe. And I will be content as well as I can, to utter my owne conceptions.</p>
                  <p>It would never have come into my Mind to have compared the Table of the Lord to a May-pole; the Wood of the one grew in Paradise, not so the other, being a light, and Ludicrous, and too often profane, stock of wood. I hope that the principles of my Education will restraine me from prophanesse in such un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitting parallels.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the Animadvertor sayes that an <hi>Expedient would</hi> not have <hi>tended to that Uniformity,</hi> that was designed herein, before <hi>God and Man,</hi> I will speak out my thoughts. That <hi>multiformity</hi> with <hi>mutuall</hi> Charity advanceth <hi>Gods Glory</hi> as much as <hi>Uniformity</hi> it selfe in matters meerly indifferent; which as the Pipes of an Organ may be of severall length and bignesse, yet all tuned into good har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony together.</p>
                  <p>I will instance in the Observation of Easter, the great Controversie betwixt the Easterne and Westerne Church in the Observation thereof; betwixt that which I may call <hi>Style Orientall,</hi> and <hi>Style Occidentall</hi> for the Date thereof. And I verily believe that God was equally honoured by both, by such as Religiously observed it.</p>

                  <p>But from these <hi>moderate men,</hi> which were so in contemplation onely, let us proceed to one who was such in practise, (the Lord Bishop of <hi>London</hi>) of whom he saith; fol. 150. <hi>He had a perfect command of his passion, an happiness not granted all Clergy-men in that Age, though Privy-Counsellors.</hi>] So perfect a man of his own passion and affections, that he will not think himself honoured with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, which comes accompanied with the disparagement of his chiefest friend; (for that this lash was made for the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> no wise man can doubt.) Our Author might have spared the dead, without any wrong to the living; but that he thinks no <hi>Topick</hi> so usefull in his <hi>Logick,</hi> as the rule of Contraries. <hi>Contraria juxta se posi a magis elucescunt.</hi> Upon which ground, the better to set off Bishop <hi>Andrews,</hi> this poor Archbishop must be charged with want of <hi>moderation, in enjoyning his own private practises and opinions upon other men.</hi> And here, that Bishop <hi>Iuxon</hi> might appear with the greater lustre, the said Arch-bishop with all his passions and infirmities, must stand by for a foil. He had indeed no such command upon his passions, as to be at all times of equall temper, especially when wearied with the businesse of the Councill-Table, and the High-Commission. But as he was soon hot, so he was soon cool'd; and so much is observed by Sir <hi>Edward Dering,</hi> though his greatest ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary, and the first that threw dirt in his face in the late long Parliament; who telleth us of him, that <hi>the roughness of his uncourtly nature sent most men dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented from him; but so, that he would often (of himself) find waies and means to sweeten ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>There were other Clergy men Privy-Counsellors beside <hi>Arch-Bishop Laud</hi>: Dr. <hi>Abbots, Neil, Harsnet, Williams, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore the Animadvertors Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of my words cannot be conclusive in Reference to <hi>Arch-Bishop Laud</hi>:</p>
                  <p>I confesse else where I do reckon Anger amongst his personall imperfections, which a Historian may do without any wrong at all, (The spirit of God saying, <note n="*" place="margin">Jam. 5.17.</note> 
                     <hi>Elias was subject to like passions as we are</hi>); I am confident as angry as Arch-Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> was, He would not have bin angry with me for writing of it, as sensible of and sorrowfull for his owne imperfection therein.</p>
                  <p>I am much of the mind of Sr. <hi>Edward Dering,</hi> that the roughnesse of his un-court-like nature, sweetned many men when they least looked for it, sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing some of them, (and my selfe for one) with unexpected Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesies.

                  <p>If I have run into so many <hi>errours,</hi> it will be charity in the <hi>Animadvertor fairly</hi> to <hi>lead</hi> me back again a <hi>foot-pace</hi> into the <hi>truth,</hi> and then he shall have <hi>thanks</hi> for his pains: alwaies provided, he doth not <hi>pinch</hi> me by the <hi>arm</hi> as he conducteth me, which will turn my <hi>thanks</hi> into <hi>anger.</hi> But seeing the <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertor</hi> careth for both alike from my hands, let him do as he pleaseth.</p>
                  <p>Next we have his <hi>tripartite History</hi> of my <hi>errors,</hi> which he will have to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from one of these three causes.

                        <item>2. <hi>Zeal</hi> to their <hi>good cause</hi>; which I behold as a <hi>jeer,</hi> and <hi>treading</hi> on the <hi>toes</hi> of <hi>Scripture, Galatians</hi> 4.18. <hi>It is good to be zealously affected alwaies in a good thing.</hi>

                  <p>These are ANI-MAD-VERSIONS indeed, when a <hi>Writer's words</hi> are <hi>madly verted, inverted, perverted,</hi> against his true intent, and their Grammaticall sense.</p>
                  <p>My words run thus, Mr. <hi>William Prin was born</hi> (<hi>about</hi> Bath) <hi>in</hi> Glocester-shire; where <hi>Bath</hi> is <hi>walled</hi> about with a <hi>Parenthesis,</hi> not essentiall to the Sentence, thus perfect without it, <hi>Mr. William Prin was born in Glocester-shire.</hi> These <hi>walls</hi> the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> hath most dis-ingenuously dismantled, to lay <hi>Bath</hi> open; and, if pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61668:110"/>
to bring it into <hi>Glocester-shire,</hi> that so he may have something to cavil at me.</p>
                  <p>Indeed <hi>Bath</hi> is not <hi>in,</hi> but <hi>within</hi> three miles of <hi>Glocester-shire</hi>; and the next eminent place to— the <hi>Village</hi> of Mr. <hi>Prin</hi>'s <hi>nativity.</hi> When Towns stand in the confines of two Counties, is it not proper enough to say, Such a one was born (about <hi>London</hi>) in <hi>Surrey,</hi> though <hi>London</hi> be in <hi>Middlesex</hi>; or (about <hi>Windsor</hi>) in <hi>Buckingham-shire,</hi> though <hi>Windsor</hi> be in <hi>Bark-shire</hi>?</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> writing in his own defence, against such as traduced him; <hi>Some,</hi> saith he, <hi>do not cavill, because they have found fault; but do find faults, because they may cavill</hi>: And be it reported to the Reader, whether the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> may be accounted one of them. And now the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> having a little refreshed himself in my <hi>Crosse-Bath,</hi> and somewhat pleased his <hi>spirit</hi> of <hi>opposition,</hi> he thus proceedeth.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, whereas he saith, that <hi>he began with the writing of some Orthodox Books</hi>] Though I look on Mr. <hi>Prin,</hi> (so far forth as I am able to judge, by some Books of his not long since published) as a man of a far more moderate spirit, than I have done formerly; yet can I not think his <hi>first Books</hi> to have been so <hi>Orthodox</hi> as our <hi>Author</hi> makes them.

                  <p>But I must and will say something of his <hi>Perpetuity of the Regenerate Man his Estate,</hi> as being that which is particularly named in my Margin, and chiefly intended by me. A <hi>Book,</hi> wherein an <hi>usefull, necessary,</hi> and <hi>comfortable Truth</hi> is learnedly defended. A <hi>Book,</hi> which will <hi>perpetuate</hi> the memory of the Writer; who, had he proceeded, and continued, as he began, none could have <hi>took just exception</hi> at, or <hi>got just advantage</hi> against him.</p>

                  <p>As for the Books of Mr. <hi>Prin,</hi> entituled, <hi>Lame Giles his Haltings, Cozen's co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zening Devotions,</hi> and his <hi>Appendix</hi> to another, they have many things repugnant to the Rules and Canons of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> No greater enemy against <hi>howing at the Name of Iesus,</hi> nor greater enemy to some Ceremonies, here by Law established.

                  <p>Thirdly, the Book called <hi>Histrio-Mastix,</hi> was not writ by Mr.<hi>Prin</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>three years</hi> before his last sufferings, as our <hi>Author</hi> telleth us, for then it must be writ or published <hi>Anno</hi> 1634. whereas indeed that Book was publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in Print about the <hi>latter end</hi> of 1632. and the <hi>Author</hi> Censur'd in <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> for some passages in it about the latter end of the year 1633. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, had it been as our <hi>Author</hi> tells us, the punishment must have preceded the offence; and he must suffer for a <hi>Book,</hi> which was not publisht at that time, and perhaps not written.

                  <p>The <hi>Animadvertor</hi> hath a speciall <hi>faculty</hi> in <hi>cavilling</hi> without cause. My <hi>Clock</hi> of <hi>time</hi> strikes <hi>true</hi> enough, but that he is minded not to tell it <hi>aright.</hi> My

                  <p>And now, Reader, judge, where the many errors be into which I have run, in the <hi>story</hi> of Mr. <hi>Prin</hi> and his <hi>sufferings,</hi> seeing <hi>no one mistake</hi> can be <hi>produced</hi> and <hi>proved</hi> against me.

<list>
                        <item>1. The revived controversie, <hi>Lords-Day,</hi> lasted ten years, bandied with books from 1628. till 1638.</item>
                        <item>2. I was loath to scatter my Book with it, but resolved on one intire Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative thereof.</item>
                        <item>3. I fixed on the yeare 1633. therein to insert the same, because the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Number, from the rising to the sinking of the difference, then came to the very heat and height thereof.</item>
                        <item>4. Hence my <hi>Narrative</hi> retreated some years back to 1628. when <hi>Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born</hi> began the difference.</item>
                        <item>5. Hence also it sallied forth to the year 1635. (when Bishop <hi>White</hi>'s book was set forth) and beyond it.</item>
                        <item>6. The date of the yeare 1633. stands still unmoveable on my Margin; the whole Relation, being for the reasons aforesaid entered under it. So that nothing is offered to the Reader unjoynted in Time, if I be but rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.</item>

                     <q>The Bishop's purgation depending chiefly upon the testimony of one <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon,</hi> it happened, that the <hi>February</hi> after, one <hi>Elizabeth Hodson</hi> was delivered of a base child, and laid to this <hi>Prideon.</hi> The Bishop finding his great Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness charged with such a load of filth and infamy, conceived it would inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate all his testimony, and, that once rendred invalid, the Bishop could easily prognosticate his own ruine; therefore he bestirs himself amain. And though by order of the Justices at the publick Sessions at <hi>Lincoln, Prideon</hi> was charged as the reputed father, the Bishop by his two Agents, <hi>Powel</hi> and <hi>Owen,</hi> procured that Order to be suppressed; and by subornation and mena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61668:111"/>
of, and tampering with, Witnesses; at length in <hi>May,</hi> 10 <hi>Car.</hi> procured the child to be fathered upon one <hi>Boon,</hi> and <hi>Prideon</hi> acquit. Which lewd practises, for the supportation of his favourite's credit, cost the Bishop, as he confest to Sir <hi>Iohn Munson</hi> and others, twelve hundred pounds; so much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, and by consequence much more.</q>

                  <p>I appeal to the unpartiall <hi>Perusers</hi> of what I wrote, whether by this <hi>Note,</hi> any thing of moment is added to the matter in hand, except the naming of a <hi>light houswife,</hi> (which I conceived beneath my <hi>History</hi>) the rest being truly by me related before.</p>

                  <p>But to proceed: the cause being brought unto a censure, fol. 157. <hi>Secretary</hi> Windebank <hi>motioned to degrade him; which</hi> (saith he) <hi>was lustily pronounced by a Knight and a Lay-man, having no precedent for the same in former Ages.</hi>] But first, it is not very certain that any such thing was moved by Sir <hi>Francis Windebank.</hi> A manuscript of that daies proceedings I have often seen, containing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree and Sentence, with the substance of every Speech then made; and amongst others, that of Sir <hi>Francis Windebank,</hi> in which I find no motion tending to a Degradation, nor any other punishment inflicted on him, than Fine, Suspen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and Imprisonment; in which the residue of the Lords concurred, as we find in our Author.</p>

                  <p>It is very certain, he moved it, and I avow it from honourable Eyes and Ears. The <hi>Animadvertor</hi> misguides the reference of those my words, [<hi>having no precedent for the same in former Ages,</hi>] making them relate to the <hi>Bishop's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation,</hi> (whereof one <hi>precedent</hi> since the <hi>Reformation, Unus homo nobis</hi>) which indeed refer to the <hi>Knight's</hi> and <hi>Lay-man</hi>'s first mentioning thereof, which is <hi>unprecedented</hi> I am sure, that such a person should FIRST make such a motion against a Bishop.</p>
                  <p>I confess, at B<hi rend="sup">p</hi>. <hi>Midleton's</hi> Degradation, some of the <hi>Lay-Privy-Counsellors</hi> were present, but acted little therein, (so, far from FIRST mentioning of it) onely <hi>concurring</hi> with the Court, the matter being chiefly managed by Arch-bishop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> and some other <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Deans</hi> the <hi>Commissioners,</hi> as most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per persons to pass such a <hi>censure</hi> on one of their own profession.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. <hi>Heylyn.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Secondly, it had been more strange if the Knight had not been a Lay-man, the Church of <hi>England</hi> not acknowledging any Order of Spirituall Knight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Knights in Divinity are greater strangers in this Land, then Lay-Divines; these last being multiplied of late, even <hi>ad infinitum</hi>; the first, never heard of.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Fuller.</speaker>
                  <p>The <hi>Pleonasm</hi> of the addition of <hi>Lay-man</hi> to <hi>Knight,</hi> is not so culpable in it self, but that it might have passed without censure; and let not the <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertor</hi> be over-confident herein.</p>
                  <p>I have been credibly informed, that Sir <hi>Miles Sandys,</hi> (third son to <hi>Edwin Arch-bishop</hi> of <hi>York</hi>) Fellow of <hi>Peter-house</hi> in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and Proctor of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity, <hi>Anno</hi> 1588. was made a <hi>Deacon,</hi> (and so no <hi>meer Lay-man</hi>) and in his younger years a <hi>Prebendary</hi> of <hi>York.</hi> Within this twenty years there was one
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61668:111"/>
Mr. <hi>Seaton</hi> beneficed in <hi>Hartfordshire,</hi> a Scotish-man, and at this day a Knight. But the matter being of no more moment, let us proceed.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Dr. <hi>Heylyn.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>And thirdly, had it been so mov'd, and so <hi>lustily</hi> mov'd, as our Author makes it, the Knight and Lay-man might have found a precedent for it in former ages.</p>
                  <p>Which last clause is to be understood (as I suppose) with reference to the times since the Reformation: For in the former times, many precedents of like nature might be easily found. And being understood of the times since the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, it is not so infallibly true, but that one precedent of it, at the least, may be found amongst us. <hi>Marmaduke Middleton</hi> advanced to the Bishoprick of Sr. <hi>Davids, Anno</hi> 1567. after he had sat in that See three and twenty years, was finally condemned (for many notable misdemeanors) not onely to be deprived of his Bishoprick, but degraded from all holy Orders. Which sentence was accordingly executed by and before the High-Commissioners at <hi>Lambeth-house,</hi> not only by reading of it <hi>in Scriptis,</hi> but by a formal divesting of him of his Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall Robes, and Priestly Vestments, as I have heard by a person of good cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, who was present at it. And somewhat there is further in the story of this <hi>Marmaduke Middleton,</hi> which concerns the <hi>Bishop</hi> now before us; of whom our Author telleth us further, That being prest by two Bishops, and three Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, to answer upon Oath to certain Articles, which were tendred to him in the <hi>Tower, he utterly refused to do it, claiming the priviledge of a Peer,</hi> fol. 159. Which plea was also made by the said Bishop of St. <hi>Davids,</hi> offering to give in his Answer to such Articles, as were fram'd against him, <hi>on his Honour</hi> onely, but refusing to do it on his <hi>Oath.</hi> Which case being brought before the Lords, then sitting in Parliament, was ruled against him; it being ordered, that he should answer upon Oath, as in fine he did. To this Bishop let us joyn his Chaplain, Mr. <hi>Osbolstone,</hi> who being engag'd in the same Bark with his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, suffered shipwrack also, though not at the same time, nor on the same occasion; Censured in <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> not onely to lose his Ecclesiasticall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, but to corporall punishments.</p>

                  <p>In my weak judgment, the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> had better have omitted this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage (of this Bishop's <hi>Degradation</hi>) in this juncture of time, where in the <hi>repute</hi> of that <hi>Function</hi> runs very low, and their adversaries too ready to take all ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to disgrace it. The rather, because Bishop <hi>Godwin</hi> taketh no notice at all thereof, but <hi>beginneth, continueth,</hi> and <hi>concludeth</hi> the <hi>life</hi> and <hi>death</hi> of this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop in lesse then <hi>two lines. Marmaduke Middleton translated from Ireland, died</hi> Novemb. 30th. 1592.</p>

                  <p>Our Author proceedeth, fol. 166. <hi>But this last personall penalty he escaped, by</hi> going beyond Canterbury, <hi>conceived seasonably gone beyond the Seas, whilst he secretly concealed himself in</hi> London.] And he had scap't the last penalty, had he staid at home. For though Mr. <hi>Osbolston</hi> at that time concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Archbishop to be his greatest enemy, yet the Archbishop was resolved to shew himselfe his greatest friend, assuring the Author of these Papers (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any thing was known of Mr. <hi>Osbolstons</hi> supposed flight) that he would cast himselfe at the Kings feet for obtaining a discharge of that corporal punishment unto which he was sentenced. Which may obtain the greater credit; First, in regard that no course was taken to stop his flight, no search made after him, nor any thing done in Order to his apprehension. And secondly, by Mr. <hi>Os<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolstons</hi> readinesse to do the Archbishop all good Offices in the time of his troubles, upon the knowledge which was given him (at his coming back) of
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61668:112"/>
such good Intentions. But of these private men enough; passe we now to the publick.</p>

                  <p>Whether or no he was sought after, I know not; this I know, he was not taken: and more do commend his warinesse in his flight, than would have praised his valour for staying, in hope his Punishment should be remitted. It had been most Mercy to stop the <hi>denouncing,</hi> but was a good <hi>after-game of pitty</hi> to <hi>stay the inflicting</hi> of so cruell a <hi>censure</hi> on a <hi>Clergyman.</hi> As the <hi>Animadvertor, then,</hi> had the <hi>Credit</hi> to know; so the <hi>Author, now,</hi> hath the <hi>Charity</hi> to believe, the Arch-Bishops good resolution.</p>
                  <p>However I cannot forget, that when the Sentence in the Star-Chamber, passed on Bishop <hi>Williams,</hi> (where he concurred with the highest in his Fine) He publickly professed, that He had fallen <hi>five times down on his knees</hi> before the King in the Bishop's behalf, but to no purpose. It might be therefore suspected that his intention to do it <hi>once</hi> for Mr. <hi>Osbolston</hi> might not have taken effect. And therefore, had the Arch-Bishop's good resolution been known unto him, Mr. <hi>Osbolston</hi> might most advisedly conceale himselfe.</p>

                     <p>The Plot had been laid long before upon other grounds, that is to say, Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stioning of some Church Lands, then in the hands of some great Persons, of which they feared a Rovocation to the Crown.

But of this there hath so much been said between the <hi>Observator</hi> and his <hi>Antagonist,</hi> that there is nothing necessary to be added to it. Secondly, there was no such matter as the <hi>passing of an Act of Revocation, for the restoring of such Lands as had been alienated from the Crown, in the minority of the Kings Predecessors,</hi> of which he tells us, <hi>fol.</hi> 192. The King indeed did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> once intend the passing of such an Act, but finding what an Insurrection was likely to ensue upon it, he followed the safer counsell of Sir <hi>Archibald Acheson,</hi> by whom he was advis'd to sue them in his Courts of Justice. Which course succeeding to his wish, so terrified ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of those great persons, who had little else but such Lands to maintain their Dignities, that they never thought themselves secure, as long as the King was in a condition to demand his own. Thirdly, though it be true enough, that <hi>some persons of honour had been denied such higher Titles as they had desired,</hi> fol. 163. yet was it not the denying of such Titles unto <hi>Men of Honour,</hi> which wrought these terrible effects; but the denying of an <hi>honorary Title</hi> to a <hi>man of no honour.</hi> If Colonel <hi>Alexander Lesly,</hi> an obscure fellow, but made rich by the spoils and plunder of <hi>Germany,</hi> had been made a Baron when he first desired it, the rest of the male-contents in <hi>Scotland</hi> might have had an heart, though they had no head. But the King not willing to dishonour so high a Title, by conferring it on so low a person, denyed the favour: Which put the man into such a heat, that presently he joyned himself to the faction there, drove on the plot, and finally undertook the command of their Armies. Rewarded for which notable service with the Title of <hi>Earl of Levin</hi> by the King himself, he could not so di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest the injury of the first refusall, but that he afterwards headed their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions upon all occasions.</p>

                     <p>But what proofs have we for all this? Onely the malice of his enemies, or our Authors own disaffection to him, or some common fame. And if it once be made a fame, it shall pass for truth, and as a truth find place in our Author's History, though the greatest falshood. <hi>Tam facilis in mendaciis fides, ut, quicquid famae liceat fingere, illi esset libenter audire, in my Author's language.</hi> But for the last he brings some proof, (he would have us think so at the least) that is to say, the words of one <hi>Bayly,</hi> a <hi>Scot</hi>; whom it concern'd to make him as odious as he could, the better to comply with a <hi>Pamphlet,</hi> called, <hi>The intentions of the Army</hi>; in which it was declared, That the <hi>Scots</hi> entred <hi>England</hi> with a purpose, to remove the Arch-bishop from the King, and execute their vengeance on him. What hand Dr. <hi>Couzens</hi> had in assisting of the work, I am not able to say. But sure I am, that there was nothing was done in it by the Bishops of <hi>England,</hi> but with the counsel and co-operation of their brethren in the Church of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, viz.</hi> the Arch-bishop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> the Arch-bishop of <hi>Glasco,</hi> the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of <hi>Murray, Ross, Brechin,</hi> and <hi>Dunblane,</hi> as appears by the Book, entituled, <hi>Hidden works of darkness, &amp;c.</hi> fol. 150, 153, 154, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And this our Author must needs know, (but that he hath a mind to quarrell the Arch-bishop upon every turn) as appears plainly, 1. By his Narrative of the Designe in King <hi>Iames</hi> his time, from the first undertaking of it by the Arch-bishop of St. <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes,</hi> and the Bishop of <hi>Galloway</hi> then being; whose Book corrected by that King, with some <hi>additions, expunctions,</hi> and <hi>accommodations,</hi> was sent back to <hi>Scotland.</hi> 2. By that unsatisfiedness which he seems to have, when the project was resum'd by King <hi>Charls,</hi> Whether the Book by him sent into <hi>Scotland,</hi> were the same which had passed the hands of King <hi>Iames,</hi> or not; which he expresseth in these words, <hi>viz. In the Reigne of King</hi> Charls, <hi>the project was resumed, but whether the same Book, or no, God knoweth,</hi> fol. 160. If so, if <hi>God onely know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were the same or no,</hi> how dares he tell us that it was not? And if it was <hi>the same,</hi> (as it may be for ought he knoweth) with what conscience can he charge the making of it upon Bishop <hi>Laud</hi>? Besides, (as afterward he telleth us, <hi>fol.</hi> 163) <hi>The Church of</hi> Scotland <hi>claimed not onely to be</hi> Independent, <hi>and free as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61668:114"/>
any Church in Christendom; a Sister, not a Daughter of</hi> England. And consequently the Prelates of that Church had more reason to decline the receiving of a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy impos'd on them, or commended to them by the Primat of <hi>England,</hi> for fear of acknowledging any subordination to him; than to receive the same Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy here by Law establisht, which they might very safely borrow from their Sister-Church, without any such danger. But, howsoever it was, the blame must fall on him who did least deserve it.</p>

                     <p>I will return to my words, which gave the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> the first occasion of this long discourse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Generally they excused the King in their writings, but charged Arch-bishop</hi> Laud.</p>
                     <p>I do not charge the Arch-bishop for <hi>compiling the Book,</hi> but say, The <hi>Scots</hi> did. Nor do I say, That what they charged on him is true; but it is true, that they did charge it on him. Had I <hi>denyed</hi> it, I had been a <hi>liar</hi>; and seeing I <hi>affirmed</hi> no more, the Animadvertor is a <hi>caviller.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is observable, that when our <hi>Chroniclers</hi> relate, how Queen <hi>Anne Bollen</hi> was charged for Incontinency; <hi>Margaret</hi> Countess of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> for treasonable compliance with the Pope; <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Surrey,</hi> for assuming the Arms of <hi>England; Edward</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerset,</hi> for designing the death of some Privy Counsellors; <hi>Thomas</hi> Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> for aspiring, by the match of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> to the English Crown; <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Essex,</hi> for dangerous machinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons against the person of Queen <hi>Elizabeth; Thomas</hi> Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> for endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to subject <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> to the King's arbitrary Power: That the Historians, who barely report these Persons thus charged, are not bound to <hi>make the charge good</hi>; it is enough if they name their respective accusers, as here I have named the <hi>Scots.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is also observable, that some of the Persons aforesaid, though condemned and executed, have since found such favour (or justice rather) with unpartiall Posterity, that though they could not revive their persons, they have restored their memories to their innocence. And if the like shall be the hap of this Arch-bishop, I shall rejoyce therein; I mean, if the <hi>Animadvertor</hi>'s defence of him seems so clear, as to out-shine the evidence; so weighty, as to out-poize all al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations, which in printed Books are published against him.</p>
                     <p>In testimony whereof, I return nothing in contradiction to what the <hi>Anim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertor</hi> hath written; and it is questionable, whether my <hi>desire</hi> that he may, or <hi>distrust</hi> that he will not, be believed be the greater. Whatever the success be, I forbear farther rejoynder.</p>
                     <p>To fight with a shaddow, (whether one's own or another's) passeth for the proverbiall expression of a vain and useless act. But seeing the <hi>dead</hi> are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times tearmed <hi>shaddows, umbrae,</hi> to fall foul on them, without absolute necessity, is an act, not onely <hi>vain,</hi> but <hi>wicked</hi>; not onely <hi>useless,</hi> but <hi>uncharitable</hi>: And therefore no more hereof.</p>

                     <p>The <hi>Scots,</hi> were then <hi>weak,</hi> unprovided of all Necessaries, not above three thousand compleat Armes to be found amongst them: The <hi>English</hi> on the other side making a formidable appearance, gallantly Horst, compleaty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and intermingled with the Choisest of the Nobility, and Gentry, in all the Nation.</p>

                     <p>I am much of the mind of the <hi>Animadvertor,</hi> that there was a visible Dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity betwixt the two Armies, and the Ods in the eye of flesh, on the side of the <hi>English.</hi> They were <hi>Gallantly Horst</hi> indeed, whether in Reference to their <hi>Horses</hi> or <hi>Riders,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> pleasantly said, <hi>It would make the Scots fight against them, were it but to get their brave Cloaths.</hi> Indeed the strength of the <hi>Scots</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted in their Reputation to be strong, (reported here by such as Friended them) and the <hi>Scotch Lyon</hi> was not half so fierce, as he was painted unto us.

                     <p>This is consonant to what He hath written, of the same Subject in the <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 74.</note> 
                        <hi>Short view of the Life and Reign of King Charls,</hi> that the King set forth against the <hi>Scots,</hi> accompanied with such an Army of <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen</hi> as might <hi>ASSURE him of a cheap and easie</hi> VICTORY.

I never heard of an ASSURANCE-Office, for the successe of <hi>Battels.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But all this is written by the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> like an <hi>Historian,</hi> but not like a <hi>Doctor in Divinity.</hi> This mindeth me of a <note n="*" place="margin">Cambden's Remains pag. 250.</note> Passage of King <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Second,</hi> who standing on the <hi>Cliffes</hi> about St. <hi>David</hi>'s in <hi>Wales,</hi> and there viewing <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, I with my Ships am able</hi> (saith he), <hi>to make a Bridge over it, if it be no further:</hi> Which speech of his being related to <hi>Murchard King</hi> of <hi>Lemster</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi>; he demanded, if he added not to his speech [with the Grace of God]: When it was answered that he made no mention of God; <hi>Then,</hi> said he more cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, <hi>I feare him the lesse, which trusteth more to Himselfe, then to the Help of GOD.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <p>Our Author thus proceedeth, fol. 168. <hi>Next day the Convocation came toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c. when, contrary to the generall expectation, it was mentioned to improve the present opportunity, in perfecting the new Canons which they had begun.</hi>] I have not heard of any such motion, as our Author speaks of, from any who were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent at that time, though I have diligently laboured to inform my self in it: Nor is it probable, that any such motion should be made, as the case then stood. The Parliament had been dissolv'd on <hi>Tuesday</hi> the 5th. of <hi>May</hi>; the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy met in Convocation on the morrow after, expecting then to be dissolved, and licensed to go home again. But, <hi>contrary to that generall expectation,</hi> in stead of hearing some newes of his Majesties Writ for their dissolution, there came an Order from the Arch-bishop to the Prolocutor, to adjourn till <hi>Saturday.</hi> And this was all the businesse which was done that day; the Clergy generally being in no small amazment, when they were required not to <hi>dissolve,</hi> till fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Order. <hi>Saturday</hi> being come, what then? <hi>A new Commission,</hi> saith he, <hi>was brought from his Majesty, by vertue whereof</hi> WE <hi>were warranted still to sit, not in the capacity of a Convocation, but of a Synod.</hi> I had thought our Author, with his <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>judicious</hi> Friends, had better harkened to the tenour of that Commission, than to come out with such a gross and wild absurdity, as this is, so fit for none as Sir <hi>Edward Deering,</hi> and for him onely, to make sport withall in the House of Commons. At the beginning of the Convocation, when the Prolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutor was admitted, the Arch-bishop produc'd his Majesties Commission un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Great Seal; whereby the Clergy was enabled to consult, treat of, and conclude such Canons, as they conceiv'd most expedient to the peace of the Church, and his Majestie's service. But this Commission being to expire with the end of the Parliament, it became void, of no effect as soon as the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was dissolved. Which being made known unto the King, who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd

the Convocation should continue, and that the Clergy should go on in compleating those Canons, which they had so happily begun; He caus'd a new Commission to be sent unto them, in the same words, and to the very same effect, as the other was; but that it was to continue <hi>duran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if they had <hi>protested,</hi> and protested earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as our Author tells us, the noise of so many Votes concurring, must needs be heard by all the rest which were then assembled; from none of which I can learn any thing of this <hi>protestation.</hi>

                     <p>I am nothing moved with his jeer, when he calleth me of the <hi>Quorum</hi> in this <hi>Convocation.

                     <p>Herein the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> doth speak a <hi>sad truth</hi>; the Dissentors were ill ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised herein, whereby their <hi>Protest</hi> (<hi>significant</hi> onely in their own consciences) was legally rendred of none effect.</p>
                     <p>But herein they may partly be excused, because they (though not entring a <hi>written Protest</hi>) supposed a <hi>verball one</hi> would <hi>manifest their dislike,</hi> and hoped it would sufficiently secure them from a danger, which (though suspected) was not certain to ensue.</p>
                     <p>This afterwards was very eagerly urged against them, by a <hi>Committee</hi> in <hi>Parliament</hi>; and sorry I am, that they could not make their <hi>answer</hi> as clear as the <hi>objection.</hi>

                     <p>Howsoever, our Author keeps himself to his former folly, shutting up his extravagancy with this conclusion, fol. 169. <hi>Thus was an old Convocation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into a new Synod.</hi>] An expression borrowed from the speech of a <hi>witty Gentleman,</hi> as he is called by the Author of the <hi>History of the Reign of King Charls,</hi> and since by him declar'd to be the Lord <hi>George Digby,</hi> now Earl of <hi>Bristow.</hi> But he that spent most of his wit upon it, and thereby gave occasion unto others for the like mistakings, was Sir <hi>Edward Deering,</hi> in a speech made against these Canons, <hi>Anno</hi> 1640. where we find these flourishes:
<q>Would you confute the <hi>Convocation</hi>? They were a <hi>holy Synod.</hi> Would you argue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Synod</hi>? Why, they were <hi>Commissioners.</hi> Would you dispute the <hi>Commission</hi>? They will mingle all powers together, and answer, that they were some fourth thing, that neither we know nor imagine; that is to say, (as it followes afterwards, <hi>pag.</hi> 27.) a <hi>Convocationall-Synodicall-Assembly</hi> of <hi>Commissioners.</hi>
                        </q>
More of this fine stuff we may see hereafter. In the mean time we may judge, by this remnant, of the whole Piece; and find it upon proof to be very sleight, and not worth the wearing. For first, the Gentleman could not, and our Author cannot chuse but know, that a <hi>Convocation</hi> and a <hi>Synod</hi> (as us'd in <hi>England</hi> of late times) are but the same one thing under divers names, the one borrowed from a <hi>Grecian,</hi> the other from a <hi>Latin</hi> Originall. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the Clergy of the Province of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> being nothing but a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinciall Synod</hi>; as a <hi>Nationall Synod</hi> is nothing else, but the Convocation of the Clergy of both Provinces. Secondly, our Author knowes by this time, that the <hi>Commission</hi> which seems to makes this doughty difference, changed not the <hi>Convocation</hi> into a <hi>Synod,</hi> (as some vainly think) but onely made that Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation active in order to the making of Canons, which otherwise had been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to proceed no further then the grant of <hi>Subsidies.</hi> Thirdly, that nothing is more ordinary, then for the <hi>Convocations</hi> of all times since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> to take unto themselves the name of <hi>Synods.</hi> For, the Articles of Religion made in the Convocation <hi>Anno</hi> 1552. are called in the Title of the Book, <hi>Articuli de quibus in Synodo Londinensi convenit, &amp;c.</hi> The same name given to those agreed on in the Convocation, <hi>Anno</hi> 1562. as appears by the Title of that Book also, in the <hi>Latin</hi> Edition. The Canons of the year 1571. are said to be concluded and agreed upon <hi>in Synodo inchoatâ Lond. in aede Divi Pauli, &amp;c.</hi> In the year 1575. came out a Book of Articles, with this Title following, <hi>viz. Articles whereupon it was agreed by the most reverend father in God, the Arch-bishop of</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61668:118"/>
                        <hi>and other the Bishops, and the whole Clergy in the Province of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>in the Convocation or synod holden at</hi> Westminster. The like we find in the year 1597. (being the last active Convocation in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time) in which we meet with a Book entituled, <hi>Constitutiones Ecclesiasticae, &amp;c. in Synodo incho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atâ Londini vicesimo quinto die mensis Octobris.</hi>

<q>I must confess my self to be at a loss in this intricate Labyrinth, unless per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there were some criticall difference between a SYNOD and a CONVOCATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON; the first being called by the Arch-bishops, in their severall and respective Provinces, as the necessities of the Church; the other onely by the King, as his oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions and affairs, did require the same.</q>

                        <hi>Endeavoured to prove,</hi> that the Clergy had no power to make Canons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out common consent in Parliament, because <hi>in the</hi> Saxon's <hi>times, Lawes and Constitutions Ecclesiasticall had the confirmation of Peers, and sometimes of the People; to which great Councills our Parliaments do succeed.</hi>] Which Argument, if it be of force to prove, that the Clergy can make no Canons, without consent of the Peers and People in Parliament; it must prove also, that the Peers and People can make no <hi>Statutes</hi> without consent of the Clergy in their Convocation. My reason is, Because such Councels in the times of the <hi>Saxons</hi> were mixt As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, consisting as well of Laicks as of Ecclesiasticks; and the matters there concluded on of a mixt nature also, Laws being passed as commonly in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:61668:120"/>
them in order to the good governance of the Common-wealth, as Canons for the regulating such things as concern'd Religion. But these great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of the <hi>Saxons</hi> being divided into two parts in the times ensuing, the Clergy did their work by themselves, without any confirmation from the King or Parliament, till the submission of the Clergy to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth. And if the Parliaments did succeed in the place of those great Councells, (as he saies they did) it was, because that antiently the Procurators of the Clergy, not the Bishops onely, had their place in Parliament, though neither <hi>Peers</hi> nor <hi>People</hi> voted in the Convocations. Which being so, it is not much to be admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>that there was some checking</hi> (as is said in the second Argument) <hi>about the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use of the generall making of such Church-Laws.</hi> But <hi>checking</hi> or repining at the proceeding of any Superiour Court, makes not the Acts thereof illegall; for, if it did, the Acts of Parliaments themselves would be reputed of no force, or illegally made, because the Clergy for a long time have <hi>checkt</hi> (and think they have good cause to check) for their being excluded. Which <hi>checking</hi> of the Commons appears not onely in those antient Authors which the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man cited, but in the Remonstrance tendred by them to King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, exemplified at large in these Animadversions, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>n.</hi> 61. But because this, being a Record of the Convocation, may not come within the walk of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lawyer, I shall put him in mind of that memorable passage in the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 51 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3d. which in brief was this: The Commons finding themselves aggrieved, as well with certain Constitutions made by the Clergy in their Synods, as with some Laws or Ordinances which were lately passed, more to the advantage of the Clergy then the Common People, put in a Bill to this effect, <hi>viz.</hi>
                        <q>That no Act nor Ordinance should from thenceforth be made or granted on the Petition of the said Clergy, without the consent of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; and that the said Commons should not be bound in times to come by any Constitutions made by the Clergy of this Realm, for their own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, to which the Commons of this Realm had not given consent.</q>
The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of which is this, (and 'tis worth the marking)
<q>
                           <hi>Car eux ne veulent estre ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligez a nul de vos Estatuz ne Ordinances faitz sanz leur Assent.</hi> Because the said Clergy did not think themselves bound (as indeed they were not in those times) by any Statute, Act, or Ordinance, made without their assent in the Court of Parliament.</q>
But that which could not be obtain'd by this <hi>checking</hi> of the Commons, in the declining and last times of King <hi>Edward</hi> 3. was in some part effected by the more vigorous prosecution of King <hi>Henry</hi> 8. who, to satisfie the desires of the Commons in this particular, and repress their checkings, obtained from the Clergy, that they should neither make nor execute any Canons, without his consent, as before is said; so that the Kings power of confirming Canons was grounded on the free and voluntary submission of the Clergy, and was not built, as the third Argument objecteth, on so weak a foundation as <hi>the Pope's making Canons by his sole power</hi>: the Pope not making Canons here, nor putting his Prescripts and Letters decretory in the place of Canons, but onely as a remedy for some present exigency. So that the King's power in this particular not being built upon the Popes, as he said it was, it may well stand, <hi>That Kings may make Canons without consent of Parliament,</hi> though he saith they cannot. But whereas it is argued, in the fourth place, that the clause in the Statute of Submission, in which it is said, that <hi>the Clergy shall not make Canons without the Kings leave,</hi> doth not imply, that by His leave alone they may make them; I cannot think that he delivered this for Law, and much less for Logick. For, had this been looked on formerly as a piece of Law, the Parliaments would have <hi>check'd</hi> at it at some time or other, and been as sensible of the Kings enchroachments, in executing this power without them, as antiently some of them had been about the <hi>disuse</hi> of the like generall consent in the making of them.</p>

                        <hi>Fol.</hi> 180. In the next place our Author tells us, that Mr. <hi>Maynard endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red also to prove, that these Canons were against the King's</hi> Prerogative, <hi>the Rights, Liberties, and Properties of the Subject.</hi>] And he saith well, that it was endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be proved, and endeavoured onely, nothing, amounting to a proof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be found in that which followes. It had before been Voted by the House of Commons, that the <hi>Canons are against fundamentall Laws of this Realm, against the Kings Prerogative, Property of the Subject, the Right of Parliament, and do tend to faction and sedition.</hi> And it was fit that some <hi>endeavours</hi> should be used to make good the <hi>Vote.</hi> But, this being but a generall charge, requires a generall answer onely, and it shall be this: Before the Canons were subscribed, they were imparted to the King by the Arch-bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and by the King communicated to the Lords of the Councill; who calling to them the assistance of the Judges, and some of the Kings Councill learned in the Laws of this Realm, caus'd the said Canons to be read and considered of, the King being then present. By all which, upon due and mature deliberation, the Canons were approv'd; and being so approv'd, were sent back to the Clergy in the Convocation, and by them subscribed. And certainly it had been strange, that they should pass the approbation of the Judges and learned Lawyers, had they contained any thing <hi>against the fundamentall Laws of the Land, the Property of the Subject, and the Rights of Parliament,</hi> or been approv'd of by the Lords of his Majesties Councill, had any thing been contained in them derogatory to the Kings <hi>Prerogative,</hi> or <hi>tending to faction and sedition.</hi> So that the foundation being ill laid, the superstructures and objections which are built upon it, may be easily shaken and thrown down. To the first therefore it is ansvvered, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath been more ordinary in all former times, than for the Canons of the Church to inflict <hi>penalties</hi> on such, as shall <hi>disobey them</hi>; exemplified in the late Canons of 1603. many of which extend not onely unto Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but even to <hi>Degradation</hi> and <hi>Irregularity,</hi> for which, see <hi>Can.</hi> 38.113. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To the second<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there is nothing in those Canons which <hi>determine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>h</hi> or <hi>li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miteth</hi> the Kings Authority, but much that makes for, and defendeth the Right of the Subject, for which the Convocation might rather have expected thanks then censure, from ensuing Parliaments. To the third, That when the Canon did declare the Government of Kings to be founded on the Law of Nature, it was not to condemn all other Governments, as being unlawfull, but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that of the Kings as being the best. Nor can it Logically be inferr'd, that because the Kingly Government is not receiv'd in all places, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought not so to be: or that the Government (by this Canon) should be the same in all <hi>places,</hi> and in all <hi>alike</hi>; because some Kings do, and may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully part with many of their Rights for the good of their Subjects, which others do, and may as lawfully retain unto themselves. To the fourth, That the Doctrine of <hi>Non-Resistance</hi> is built expresly on the words of St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 13. <hi>v.</hi> 2. and therefore to condemn the Canon in that behalf, is to condemn the Word of God upon vvhich it is founded. Finally, to the fifth and last, That the Statute of 5, 6 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. declaring, that the daies there mentioned shall be kept for <hi>Holy-daies,</hi> and no other, relates onely to the abolishing of some other Festivalls, which had been formerly observ'd in the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and not to the disabling of the Church from ordaining any other Holy-dayes, (on emergent causes) in the times to come.</p>

But he had no reason to impute it to the <hi>finger of God,</hi> or to the carelesnesse of the Bishops in suffering themselves to be so supinely surpris'd. For first the Bishops saw too plainly, that those general words by which they were disabled from inflicting any <hi>pain</hi> or <hi>penalty,</hi> would be exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to Suspension, Excommunication, and other Ecclesiastical censures. But secondly, they saw withall that the stream was too strong for them to strive against, most of the Lords being wrought on by the popular party in the House of Commons, to passe the Bill. Thirdly, they were not without hope, that when the <hi>Scots</hi> Army was disbanded, and that Nation satisfied, by the Kings condescensions to them, there might be such an explication made of those ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral words, as to restrain them unto temporal <hi>pains</hi> and civill penalties, by which the censures of the Church might remain as formerly. And fourthly, in order thereunto they had procured a <hi>Proviso</hi> to be entred in the House of

                     <p>The occasion of it was a Speech made by the King in the House of Peers in favour of the Earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> upon the Saturday before; which mov'd them to unite themselves by this Protestation for <hi>bringing to condign punishment, all such as shall either by force, practice, plots, counsels, conspiracies, or otherwise do any thing to the contrary of any thing in the same Protestation contain'd.</hi> Which Protestation being carried into the House of Peers, was after some few dayes generally taken by that House also. But the prevalent party in the House of Commons, having further aims then such as our Author pleaseth to take notice of, first caus'd it to be printed by an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the fifth of <hi>May,</hi> that they might be sent down to the <hi>Sheriffes and Iustices of Peace in the severall Shires</hi>; to whom they intimated, <hi>that as they justified th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That Bishop was releast upon Bail, when the other were returned unto his Diocesse, as the others did, and there continued for a time; when of a suddain he was snatched from his House at <hi>Downham,</hi> in the Isle of <hi>Ely,</hi> carried to the Tower, and there imprisoned; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver being brought unto a Hearing, nor any cause shewed for his imprisonment to this very day.</p>

                     <p>Nothing false or faulty.

                     <p>King James setled the <hi>Deanry of Westminster</hi> under the great Seal on <hi>Dr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams,</hi> so long as he should continue Bishop of Lincoln. <hi>Hinc illa Lacrimae,</hi> hence the great <hi>heaving</hi> and <hi>hussing</hi> at Him, because He would not resigne it, which was so signal a Monument of his Master's favour unto him.</p>
                     <p>Being Arch-bishop of <hi>York,</hi> King <hi>Charls</hi> confirmed his <hi>Deanry</hi> unto him for

three years, in lieu of the profits of his Arch-bishoprick, which the King had taken <hi>Sede vacante.</hi> So that it is probable enough, the renuing that Tearm might be a Joynt-Motive of his going to <hi>Oxford.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But I see nothing which I have written can be cavilled at, except because I call <hi>Yorkshire</hi> the King's <hi>Quarters,</hi> which <hi>as yet</hi> was the Kings WHOLE, when the Arch-bishop first came thither, (as being a little before the War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan) though few Weeks after, it became the King's <hi>Quarters.</hi> Such a Prolepsis is familiar with the best Historians; and, in effect, is little more, then when the <note n="*" place="margin">Animadversi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, pag. 205.</note> Animadvertor calleth the <hi>Gag</hi> and <hi>Appello Caesarem,</hi> the Books of <hi>Bishop Montague</hi>; who, when they were written by him, was no (though soon after a) <hi>Bishop.</hi>

                     <p>I tell you again, It is true. The Earl of <hi>Essex</hi> and the Lord <hi>Say</hi> were two of the Lords (though this be more then I need discover) who checked them.

                     <p>But I must needs say, that there was small ingenuity in acknowledging a mistake in that, wherein they had not been mistaken; or by endeavouring to avoid a <hi>reputed Rock,</hi> to run themselves on a certain Rock, even the Rock of Scandall.</p>

                     <p>Their brief and generall acknowledgment, that they vvere sorry that they had spoken in this point, vvhat had incurred the displeasure of the Temporall Lords, was no trespass on their own ingenuity, nor had shadovv of scandall to others therein.</p>
                     <p>I confess, men must not bear fals-witness, either against themselves or others; nor may they betray their right, especially when they have not onely a <hi>perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall concernment</hi> therein, but also are in some sort <hi>Feoffees in trust</hi> for Posterity. However, vvhen a predominant Power plainly appears, which will certainly over-rule their cause against them; without scandall, they may (not to say in Christian prudence they ought) to wave the vindication of their priviledges for the present, waiting, wishing, and praying, for more moderate and equall times, wherein they may assert their right, with more advantage to their cause, and less danger to their persons.</p>

                     <p>For that the <hi>English</hi> Bishops had their vote in Parliament as a <hi>third Estate,</hi> and not in the capacity of <hi>temporal Barons,</hi> will evidently appear by these reasons following. For first, the Clergy in all other Christian Kingdoms of these Northwest parts make the <hi>third Estate</hi>; that is to say, in the <hi>German Empire,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by <hi>Thuanus</hi> the Historian, <hi>lib.</hi> 2.

l.</hi> 7. The <hi>Swedes</hi> observing antiently the same form and order of Government as was us'd by the <hi>Danes.</hi> The like we find in <hi>Camden</hi> for the Realm of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in which antiently the Lords Spirituall, <hi>viz.

And certainly it were very strange, if the Bishops and other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates in the Realm of <hi>England,</hi> being a great and powerfull body, should move in a lower Sphere in <hi>England,</hi> then they do elsewhere. But secondly, not to stand onely upon probable inferences, we find first in the History of <hi>Titus Livius,</hi> touching the Reign and Acts of <hi>King Henry</hi> the fifth, <hi>that when his Funerals were ended, the three Estates of the Realm of</hi> England <hi>did assemble toge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, the Petition tendred to <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard</hi> Duke of <hi>Glocester,</hi> to accept the Crown, occurring in the Parliament Rolls, runs in the name of the <hi>three Estates</hi> of the Realm, that is to say,
<q>The Lords Spirituall, and Temporall, and the Commons thereof. Thirdly, in the first Parliament of the said <hi>Richard</hi> lately Crowned King, it is said expresly, that at the request and by the consent of the three Estates of this Realm, that is to say, the Lords Spirituall, and Temporall, and Commons of this Land assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in this present Parliament, and by Authority of the same it be pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, decreed, and declared, That our said Soveraign Lord the King, was, and is the very and undoubted King of this Realm of <hi>England, &amp;c.</hi> Fourthly, it is acknowledged so in the Statute of 1 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 3. where the Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall and Temporall, and the Commons in that Parliament assembled, being said expresly, and <hi>in terminis,</hi> to represent the three Estates of this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> did recognize the Queens Majesty to be their true, lawfull, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Soveraign Liege Lady, and Queen.</q>
Add unto these the Testimony of Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> though a private person, who in his Book of the Jurisdiction of Courts (published by order of the <hi>long Parliament</hi>) chap. 1. doth expr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Those aged Bishops had been but little studied in their owne concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and betray'd their Rights, if any of them did acknowledge any such mistake in challenging to themselves the name and priviledges of the third Estate.</p>

                     <p>In this long discourse, the <hi>Animadvertor</hi> hath given in the severall Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, whereof I, in my Church-History, gave the Totall summe; when saying, that there were passages in the old Statutes, which did countenance the Bishops sitting in Parliament in the Capacity of a THIRD ESTATE.</p>
                     <p>I have nothing to returne in Opposition, and heartily wish that his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (to use the Sea-man's phrase) may prove <hi>stanche</hi> and <hi>tight, to hold water,</hi> when some Common-Lawyer shall examine them.</p>

                        <hi>so farre</hi> in this point, I could wish he had gon a <hi>little further,</hi> even to answer the two Common Objections against the THIRD-ESTATE SHIP of Bishops.</p>
                     <p>The First is this: The Bishop not to speak of <hi>Bishops Suffragan,</hi> of the <hi>Isle of Man,</hi> is a Bishop for all purposes, and intents, of Jurisdiction and ordination, yet hath he no place in Parliament, because not holding <hi>per In egram Baroniam,</hi> by <hi>an Intire Barony.</hi> Now if Bishops sat in Parliament as a THIRD-ESTATE, and not as so many Barons, why hath not the Bishop of <hi>Man,</hi> being in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>York,</hi> a place in Parliament as well as the rest?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, If the Bishops sit as a THIRD-ESTATE, then Statutes made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

                     <p>I also, request him (when <hi>his Hand is in</hi>) to satisfie the <hi>Objection,</hi> taken from a <note n="*" place="margin">Alledged by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Non sedemus hîc Episcopi, sed Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rones: Nos Barones, vos Barones, Pares hîc sumus. <hi>We sit not here as Bishops, but as Barons,</hi> We are Barons, <hi>You are Barons, here we are peers,</hi> which is much inforced by <hi>Anti-Episcopists.</hi> And whereas the Animadvertor translated it <hi>not as Bishops onely,</hi> it is more then questionable, that this <hi>interpolation</hi> ONLY will not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by such who have a mind curiously to examine the matter.</p>
                     <p>I protest my integrity herein, that I have not started these Objections of my selfe, having had them urged against me; and though I can give a bungling An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer unto them, I desire that the Animadvertor (being better skill'd in Law) would be pleased (if it ever comes again in his way) to returne an Answer as short and clear as the Objections are; and I, and many more, will be bound to returne him thanks.</p>

                           </gap>oul</hi> as our Author makes them. But first, our Author might have done well to have satisfied himselfe in all particulars, before he rais'd so foul a scandall on his Christian Brethren, and not to have taken them up upon hear-say, or on no better grounds then the credit of the <hi>first Century,</hi> which he after mentions. Which modesty he might have learnt, 1. From the Author of that scandalous and infamous Pamphlet, (whatsoever he was) desisting from the writing of a <hi>second Century,</hi> as being sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that the <hi>Subject was generally odious.</hi> And certainly, if it were <hi>odious</hi> in that party to write the same, it must be much more <hi>odious</hi> in our Author to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the writing. He might have learnt it, 2. from the most excellent Master in the Schools of Piety and Morality which this Age hath given us, even the King himselfe; who as our Author telleth us, <hi>fol.</hi> 208. would not give way that any such Book should be written <hi>of the vicious lives of some Parliament Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> when such an undertaking was presented to him. But if their <hi>Offences</hi> were so <hi>foul,</hi> the Writer of the Century had some reason for what he did, and our Author had some reason for what he saith, especially if the putting in of one <hi>Herb</hi> had not <hi>spoil'd all the Pot of Pottage.</hi> But first, <hi>Qui alterum incusat probri seipsum intueri oporiet,</hi> is a good rule in the Schools of Prudence, and therefore it concerns our Author to be sure of this, that all things be well at home, both in his owne Person and in his Family, before he throw so much foul dirt in the face of his Brethren. In which respect <hi>Manutius</hi> was conceived to be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fittest man in <hi>Rome</hi> (as indeed he was) to perform the Office of a <hi>Ce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And secondly,

                        <hi>Non temerè de fratre malt aliquid credendum esse,</hi> was antiently a <hi>Rule</hi> in the Schools of Charity; which our Author either hath forgotten; or else never learned. He would otherwise have examin'd the Proofs, before he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the Sentence; and not have positively condemned these poor men for such <hi>foul offences as cryed to justice for punishment</hi>; and of such <hi>scandalous enormities,</hi> as were not fit to be covered with the Mantle of Charity. But he takes himselfe up at last with a doubt, that there might want sufficient proof to convict them of it. <hi>Nothing</hi> (saith he) <hi>can be said in their excuse,</hi> if <hi>(what was the main matter) their crimes were sufficiently proved.</hi> And if they were not <hi>sufficiently proved,</hi> as indeed they were not, (no witnesse coming in upon Oath to make good the Charge) our Author hath sufficiently prov'd himselfe an <hi>unrighteous Iudge,</hi> an <hi>Accusator stratrum,</hi> as we know who is, in accusing and condemning them for <hi>scandalous enormities</hi> and <hi>foul offences,</hi> branding them by the name of <hi>Baal,</hi> and calling them <hi>unsavory Salt, not fit to be thrown upon the Dunghill,</hi> yet all this while to be unsa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in the sufficiency of the proof. <hi>Decedis ab Officio Religiosi Iudicis,</hi> is the least that can be said here; and I say no more. Onely I note, what sport was made by that <hi>Century</hi> then, and may be made hereafter of this part of the Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>; to which the libellous Pamphlets of <hi>Martin-Mar-Prelate,</hi> publisht in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, serv'd for Authentick Witnesses, and sufficient evidence to disgrace this Church.

                     <p>For not being able to disprove it, I shall quit our Author with one story, and satisfie the equal Reader with another. First for my Author, I have heard a tale of a <hi>Lady</hi> too, to whose Table one Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> was a welcome though a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent guest; and being asked once by her, Whether he would please to eat the wing of a <hi>Woodcock,</hi> he would needs put her to the question, how her Ladyship knew it was a <hi>Woodcock,</hi> and not a <hi>Wood-hen.</hi> And this he pressed with such a troublesome importunity, that at last the Lady answered with some shew of displeasure, that the Woodcock was Fuller headed, Fuller breasted, Fuller thighed, and in a word, every way <hi>Fuller.</hi> Whether this tale be <hi>true or false,</hi> I am not able to say; but being <hi>generally believ'd,</hi> I have set it down also.</p>

                     <p>But my other story is more serious, intended for the satisfaction of our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and the Reader both. It was in <hi>November, Anno</hi> 1639. that I receiv'd a message from the Lord <hi>Archbishop,</hi> to attend him the next day at two of the clock in the afternoon. The Key being turn'd which opened the way into his Study, I found him sitting in a chair, holding a paper in both hands, and his eyes so fixt upon that paper, that he observ'd me not at my coming in. Finding him in that posture, I thought it fit and manners to retire again. But the noise I made by my retreat, bringing him back unto himselfe, he recall'd me again, and told me after some short pawse, that he well remembred that he had sent for me, but could not tell for his life what it was about. After which he was pleas'd to say (not without tears standing in his eyes,) that he had then newly receiv'd a letter acquainting him with a Revolt of a Person of some Quality in <hi>North-Wales,</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; that he knew that the increase of Popery by such frequent Revolts, would be imputed unto him, and his Brethren the Bishops, who were all least guilty of the same; that for his part he had done his utmost, so far forth as it might consist with the Rules of Prudence, and the Preservation of the Church, to suppresse that party, and to bring the chief stick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers in it to condign punishment, to the truth whereof (lifting up his wet eyes to Heaven) he took God to witnesse; conjuring me (as I would answer it to God at the day of Judgement) that if ever I came to any of those places, which he, and his Brethren, by reason of their great age, were not like to hold long, I would imploy all such abilities as God had given me in suppressing that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who by their open undertakings, and secret practices, were like to be the ruine of this flourishing Church. After some words of mine upon that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, I found some argument to divert him from those sad remembrances, and having brought him to some reasonable composednesse, I took leave for the present; and some two or three dayes after waiting on him again, he then told me the reason of his sending for me the time before. And this I deliver for a truth on the faith of a Christian; which I hope will over-ballance any Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which hath been brought to prove such <hi>Popish inclinations,</hi> as he stands generally charg'd with in our Author's History.</p>

                     <p>By that Parenthesis [<hi>as he calleth himselfe</hi>] it is left suspitious, that his <hi>true Name</hi> was otherwise.

                     <p>Nor indeed could it stand with reason, that they should wave the patronage of a gracious Soveraign, who had been a <hi>Nursing Father</hi> to them, and put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under the arbitrary power of those who they knew minded nothing but destruction toward them. And that the University did not think it selfe oblig'd by any thing contained in that Article, appears even by our Author himselfe, who tells us in this very passage, that <hi>the Delegates from the University pleaded
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61668:134"/>
their priviledges before the Committee of Parliament, that they were onely visitable by the King, and such as should be deputed by him</hi>; which certainly they had never done (unlesse our Author will conclude them to be fools or madmen) had they before submitted to that <hi>Paramount power,</hi> which he adscribes unto the <hi>Houses.</hi> Nor did the Houses of Parliament find themselves impowered by this clause of the Article, to obtrude any such <hi>Visitation</hi> on them. And therefore when the Delegates had pleaded, and prov'd their priviledges, a Commission for a Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was issued by the two Houses of Parliament in the name of the King, but under the new broad Seal which themselves had made; which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the University stood still on their own defence, in regard that though the Kings name was us'd in that Commission, yet they knew well, that he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver given his consent unto it. Whereupon followed that great alteration both in the <hi>Heads</hi> and <hi>Members</hi> of most <hi>Colledges</hi> which our Author speaks of.</p>

                     <p>Our Author proceeds. And on the reading of Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> his Answer, declares expresly, that <hi>no such Oath was tendred by him to that University.</hi>] But first, Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> doth not absolutely deny, that there was any such Oath, but that he <hi>was a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to it</hi>: and possibly he might be so far a <hi>stranger</hi> to it, as not to be an Actor in that part of the Tragedy. Secondly, Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> onely saith, that he <hi>cannot call to mind, that any such thing was mov'd by the Earl of</hi> Manchester; and yet I trow, such a thing might be mov'd by the Earl of <hi>Manchester,</hi> though Mr. <hi>Ash</hi> after so many years was willing not <hi>to call it to mind.</hi> Or else if no such Oath was <hi>tendred by him,</hi> as our Author is assur'd there was not, that part of the Tragedy might be acted by Mr. <hi>Good</hi> the other Chaplain, without communicating his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions to his fellow <hi>Visitor.</hi>

                     <p>Mr. <hi>Ash,</hi> on serious and Solemn recollection, hath since given me Assurance, both by his word of Mouth, and <hi>Writing,</hi> that no such Oath was urged to his knowledge; and being a Minister of the Gospell, I am in Charity and Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence bound to believe Him.</p>

                     <p>And therefore thirdly, I would know why Mr. <hi>Good</hi> was not writ to also, that having from him the like Certificate, our Author might have had the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grounds for his <hi>unbelief,</hi> before he had pronounc'd so positively against the Author of that <hi>Querela.</hi>

                     <speaker>Fuller.</speaker>
                     <p>The reason was because Mr. <hi>Good</hi> was dead, and (had I known whither) I did not know by what <hi>Carrier</hi> to convay my Letter unto him. I pronounced not positively against <hi>Querela</hi> in point of the Oath, which I left under very vehement <hi>Suspitions.</hi>

                     <p>Fourthly, and finally, it is not easie to be thought, that the Author of that Book should have vented such a manifest falshood, especially in a matter so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory to all Christian charity, and that neither the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Manchester,</hi> nor either of these two <hi>Chaplains,</hi> or any friends of theirs, should in the space of ten
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:61668:135"/>
years and more, endeavour to wipe off such an odious imputation, till our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor out of pure zeal to the <hi>Paramount-power,</hi> played the Advocate in it.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Possibly the <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Manchester</hi> might <hi>not know,</hi> that the <hi>urging</hi> of such an <hi>Oath</hi> was objected against him and his; and probably, if he <hi>did know,</hi> he satisfied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his own <hi>Integrity</hi> and <hi>Innocence,</hi> leaving the <hi>Blame</hi> and <hi>Shame</hi> to fall on such as were guilty thereof.</p>

                     <p>But to return again to <hi>Oxford,</hi> one of the first effects which followed on the alteration before remembred (though mentioned by our Author in another place) was the rifling of the Treasury in <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledge, of which he tells us, <hi>lib.</hi> 9. <hi>fol.</hi> 234. That a <hi>considerable sum of Gold,</hi> being by Dr. <hi>Humphry</hi> (who had been Master of that Colledge) <hi>left in a Chest, not to be opened, except some great necessity urged thereunto, was lately shar'd between</hi> Dr. <hi>Wilkinson</hi> (who then held the place of President by the power of the Visitors) <hi>and the fellows</hi> there.

The summe there found amounted to above twelve hundred double Pistolets, the old Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor having no fewer than one hundred for his part of the spoile, and every fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low thirty a piece for theirs; each Pistolet exchang'd at sixteen shillings six pence, and yet the Exchanger got well by the bargain too. Too great a sum for Dr. <hi>Humphry,</hi> who had many Children, and no provident Woman to his Wife, to leave behind him to the Colledge, had he been so minded. The Money (as the Tradition went in that Colledge) was left there by the Founder, to remedy and repair such ruines, as either the casualty of fire, or the ravages of a Civil warre might bring upon it; to which the nature of the Coin being all <hi>French</hi> pieces (remember that the <hi>English</hi> at that time were Masters of a great part of <hi>France</hi>) gives a further testimony.</p>

                     <p>Fol. 227. <hi>He sueth to the Parliament for favour, and obtained it, whose General in a manner he becomes in laying siege to the Town and Castle of</hi> Abercon-way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] This is the <hi>truth,</hi> but whether it be the whole <hi>truth,</hi> or not, I do more then doubt. His <hi>suing for</hi> and <hi>obtaining pardon from the Parliament,</hi> precedeth in the order of time, his being their <hi>General</hi>; and therefore it is not to be thought, but that he had done some special service to the Parliament to prepare the way for such a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Before his commitment to the Tower about the Bishops Protestation, he was grown as odious to the Commons, as before he had been honoured by them. He had liv'd some time with the King at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and is said to have done him good services in <hi>Wales</hi>; and (which is most) he had a fair temporall Estate, able to yeeld some thousands of pounds for Composition in <hi>Gold-smiths hall.</hi> So that there must be somewhat in it more then ordinary, which occasioned that he neither came under Fine nor Ransome, as the rest of the Kings party did. But what that was, whether he serv'd them with intelligence when he was at <hi>Oxford,</hi> or by inhibiting his Tenants and Neighbours to pay their accustomed Taxes to the Kings Forces when he liv'd in <hi>Wales,</hi> I determine not. Certain it is, that before his redintegration with them, he had been in a manner besieged in his House of <hi>Penrin</hi> by the Lord <hi>Byron,</hi> for the prohibiting of sending in such provisions as had been required; and that observing with what carel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Upon the merit of which service, and the promise of greater, it is no wonder if such Ministers and Sollicitors of his as were imploy'd in that businesse, compounded for him without <hi>fine,</hi> though not without money. That which our Author tells us of his being their General, seems to have been fore-signified some five or six years before the siege of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> Castle. For I remember that about such time as he was prisoner in the Tower with the rest of the Bishops, his picture was sold commonly in black and white, in his Episcopal Roabs, with a squa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>But our Author goes on, Ibid. <hi>He was very chaste in his Conversation.</hi>] And I hope so too, notwithstanding the scandalous reports of <hi>Weldon</hi> the <hi>namelesse Author</hi> aim'd at (in the following words) in his Pamphlet called the <hi>Court of King Iames,</hi> and some vulgar fames or hear sayes too much credited by a late Historian. But I must needs say, that I am not satisfied in the arguments which are brought to prove it. <hi>Wilson</hi> in his unworthy History of the reign of King <hi>Iames,</hi> makes him to be <hi>Eunuchus ab utero,</hi> an Eunuch from his Mother's womb. The author of the pamphlet called the <hi>Observator observed,</hi> conceives that <hi>Wilson</hi> went too far in this expression, and rather thinks, <hi>that he contracted some impotency by falling on a stake when he was a Boy, fol,</hi> 10. Our Author here seems to incline unto this last, assuring us from such <hi>who knew the Privacies and casual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his infancy,</hi> that this Arch-bishop was <hi>but one degree remov'd from a</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sogynist, <hi>though to palliate his infirmity to noble Females he was most compleat in his courtly addresses.</hi> But first, the falsity and frivolousnesse of these defences leave the poor man under a worse suspicion than they found him in. His manly coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, together with his masculine voyce, shewed plainly that he was no Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch; and the agreeablenesse of his conversation with the female Sex, did as plainly shew, that he was no <hi>Misogynist,</hi> or Woman-hater. And secondly, admitting these surmises to be true and real, they rather serve to evidence his impotency than to prove his chastity; it being no chastity in that man to abstain from Women, who either by casualty, or by nature is disabled from such co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulations. The vertue of chastity consisteth rather in the integrity of the soul, than the mutilation of the body; and therefore more to be ascrib'd to those pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, <hi>Qui salvis oculis foeminam vident,</hi> in <hi>Tertullian's</hi> language, than to the old Philosopher, who put out his eyes to avoid temptations of that nature. So that if this be all which they have to say for the Bishop's chastity, these advocates had shewed more wisdom in saying nothing, than speaking so little to the purpose.</p>

And because I would not be thought to say this without book, I have both seen and had in my keeping, till of late, (if I have it not still) an Acquittance made unto a Minister in discharge of the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Pension of twenty Nobles <hi>per annum,</hi> to one who was then a Student in <hi>Christ-Church.</hi> The name of the parties I forbeare; he that receiv'd it, and he for whom it was receiv'd, (and perhaps he that paid it too) being still alive.

it would be both to him and them to keep up the Commons of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and gaind so farre upon them that they pass'd over to him all the rents of that Church, upon condition that he should pay the annual pensions of the Prebendaries, School-Masters, Quire-men, and inferiour Officers, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Commons of the Scholars.

                     <p>Our Author proceeds, Fol. 228. <hi>He was so great an honourer of the English Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, that of his owne cost he caused the same to be translated into Spanish, and fairly printed, to confute their false conceipt of our Church,</hi> &amp;c.] If this be true, it makes not onely to his honour, but also to the honour of the English Liturgy, transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into more Languages then any Liturgy in the world, whatsoever it be; translated into Latine by <hi>Alexander Alesius,</hi> a learned <hi>Scot</hi> in King <hi>Edwards</hi> time; as afterward by Dr. <hi>Walter Haddon</hi> in the reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and his translation mended by Dr. <hi>Mocket</hi> in the time of King <hi>Iames</hi>: translated into <hi>French</hi> by the command of that King, for the Isles of <hi>Guernsey</hi> and <hi>Iersey</hi>: into <hi>Spanish</hi> at the charge of this Bishop (as our Author telleth us): and finally into <hi>Greek</hi> by one Mr. <hi>Petly,</hi> by whom it was dedicated and presented to the late Arch-Bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the greatest Patron and Advancer of the English Liturgy. But secondly, I have some reason to doubt, that the Liturgy was not translated at the charges of Bishop <hi>Williams.</hi> That it was done by his pocure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I shall easily grant: but whosoever made the Bill of Charges, the Church paid the reckoning; the <hi>Dominican</hi> Fryer who translated it, being rewarded with a Benefice and a good Prebend, as the Bishop himselfe did signifie by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Duke of <hi>Buckingham.</hi>

Thus far I am assured by such as saw it, That the Bishop (who had more skill in the Spanish then his policy would publiquely own), did with his owne hand correct every <hi>sheet</hi> therein.</p>

                     <p>And Thirdly, Taking it for granted, that the Liturgy was translated and printed at this Bishop's charges; yet does not this prove him to be so great an honourer of it as our Author makes him. For had he been indeed a true honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer of the English Liturgy, he would have been a more diligent attendant on it than he shewed himself: never repairing to the Church at <hi>Westminster</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he was Dean) from the 18. of <hi>February</hi> 1635. when the businesse of the great Pew was judged against him, till his Commitment to the Tower in <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> 1637.</p>

                     <p>One reason why he seldome came to Prayers to Westminster Church, was, because he was permitted but little to live there, after he fell into the King's displeasure, being often sent away the day after he came thither. On the same token, that once Sr. <hi>Iohn Cook</hi> being sent unto him to command him to avoid the Deanery; Mr. <hi>Secretary,</hi> said the Bishop, <hi>what Authority have you to command a Man out of his owne House</hi>? Which wrought so much on the old Knight, that he was not quiet till he had gotten his owne pardon.</p>

                     <p>Nor ever going to the Chappell of the <hi>Tower</hi> (where he was a Prisoner) to attend the Divine Service of the Church, or receive the Sacrament, from <hi>Iuly</hi> 1637. when he was committed, to <hi>November</hi> 1640. when he was enlarged. A very strong Argument that he was no such Honourer of the <hi>English Liturgy,</hi> as is here pretended: A Liturgy most highly esteemed in all places whereso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it came, and never so much vilified, despis'd, condemn'd as amongst our selves; and those amongst our selves who did so vilifie and despise it, by none more countenanced then by him, who is here said to be so <hi>great</hi> an <hi>Honourer</hi> o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>During his durance in the Tower, there was a Kinsman of Sr. <hi>William Balforés</hi> then Lieutenant, a Scotish man (and his name, Mr. <hi>Melvin too</hi>) who being mortally sick, sent for Bishop <hi>Williams</hi> to pray with him. The Bishop read to him <hi>the Visitation of the sick,</hi> having fore-acquainted this dying man, That there was a form of Absolution in this Prayer, if he thought fit to receive it: Wherewith Mr. <hi>Melvin</hi> was not onely well satisfied, but got himselfe up as well as he could on his knees in the bed, and in that posture received Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61668:140"/>
favourable to some select Persons of that Opinion.</hi> An Action somewhat like to that of the Earl of <hi>Kildare,</hi> who being accused before <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, for burning the Cathedrall Church of <hi>Cassiles</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> profess'd ingeniously, <hi>That he would never have burnt the Church, if some body had not told him that the Bishop was in it.</hi> Hate to that Bishop, an Arch-Bishop of <hi>Ireland,</hi> incited that mad <hi>Earl</hi> to burn his Cathedrall Church. And hate to Bishop <hi>Laud,</hi> the Primate and Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litan of all <hi>England,</hi> stir'd up this Bishop to raise a more unquenchable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bustion in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> So that we may affirm of him as <hi>Tertullian</hi> (in another case) of the Primitive Christians, viz. <hi>Tanti non est bonum, quanti est odium Christianorum.</hi> But are we sure that he was favourable to the Non-Conformists out of an antipathy to Bishop <hi>Laud</hi> onely?

            <p>You may be pleased to remember that some two years since being informed by our friend <hi>Mr. Davenport,</hi> that you took some excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons at what I had written concerning you, in my Church-History, I returned you an Answer to this Effect.</p>
            <q>That I would make you just reparation, either in the next Edition of my History, or in another Book which I was about to set forth <hi>Of the Worthies of England:</hi> choosing therein the most proper and conspicuous place, which might render it most visible to the Reader.</q>
            <p>This last Book had since been printed, had not the unhappy difference between <hi>Dr. Heylyn,</hi> and me, retarded it.</p>
            <p>What I wrote concerning your Accusation in the House of Commons, I transcribed out of the Manuscript journalls of that House. As for your purgation in the House of Lords, I knew not thereof: which maketh such my omssion the more excusable.</p>

            <p>EPistles to the Reader by way of Preparation are properly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the front of a Book; but those by way of Recollection follow best in the Reare thereof. If you have had the Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and Patience to peruse this Book, you deserve the Name of a Reader indeed; and I do as heartily wish, as charitably hope Thee Qualified with those three Epithets wherewith I have intitled thee.

               <hi>I</hi> Hope, Sir, that we are not mutually Un-friended by this Difference which hath hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened betwixt us.

            <p> I could have wished, that in your book entituled, <hi>a Case concerning the buying of Bishops Lands, with the lawfullnesse thereof,</hi> &amp;c. you had forborn this following expression against me.</p>

               <p>As that flashy jeering Author of the late published History of the Church (upon hear-say onely, and out of Resolution <hi>calumniari fortiter</hi>) hath falsely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Let us go back to the occasion of these words. When Dr. <hi>Hacket, May</hi> the 11<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. 1641. made a Speech, in behalfe of the <hi>Deans,</hi> and <hi>Chapters</hi> of England, for the preventing of the alienation of their Lands and revenues, you returned an Answer thereunto; and about the conclusive Result thereof, is our present contest.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Dr. <hi>Burges.</hi>
               </speaker>
               <p>You say, you onely concluded those things unalienable from the Church, which were setled upon it by Divine Right.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fuller.</speaker>
               <p>I Report, you concluded <hi>Deans</hi> and <hi>Chapters</hi> lands alienable without sin of Sacriledge, from that particular Use; yet so as that they ought still to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served to the Church in generall.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>I confesse, I neither was, (nor might be) present in the Parliament: and therefore must take it on <hi>Hear-say.</hi> However I distinguish on <hi>hear-say</hi> which is double,

            <p>I conceive mine to be of the latter and better sort. And I have no other way to defend my selfe, than by appealing to many members of the House then pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, still alive, and firmly remembring that transaction.</p>
            <p>Surely, Sir, the Parliament never brought into question, <hi>Whether things might be alienated from the Church, which by Divine Right were setled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> It was inconsistent with their prudence, amounting in effect to this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, <hi>Whether Gods, or their power were the highest.</hi> And, Sir, if you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded no more than what you say, you <hi>concluded</hi> what was never <hi>controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> by any Christian.</p>

            <p>I Am sensible of a mistake in the Catalogue of <hi>Vice-Chancellours</hi> and <hi>Proctours</hi> of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> (besides a needless repetition of <hi>two, twice</hi>) betwixt the years 1617, and 1620. <hi>inclusively.</hi> It arose from some difference betwixt the written Coppies I used, and such (I believe, the truer) as are since printed.</p>
            <p>I see <hi>what,</hi> not <hi>whither,</hi> to <hi>sly,</hi> who can <hi>discover,</hi> do <hi>confesse,</hi> but [for the present] cannot <hi>rectify</hi> the <hi>Errour,</hi> craving the charitable assistance of my <hi>Mothers</hi> Sons herein.</p>
            <p>The best is, all the mistake lyeth within the compasse of <hi>three years,</hi> (all <hi>officers</hi> being right <hi>before</hi> and <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>) and the <hi>Fortunes</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> the Truth I mean of our <hi>Church-History,</hi> is not concerned therein.</p>
