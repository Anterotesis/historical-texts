            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

*</head>
            <p>AS the authoure of thys lytle
boke moued wyth the desyre
to profyte as wel the rude and
vnlearned as the lettered and
professers of knowlege, wrote
it in his vulgare tongue: euen
so I (moste dearelye beloued bretherne) moued
also wyth the desyre to brofyte my naturall
countremen so much as shal lye in my litle po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
haue thought it my bounden deuty to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploye
my diligence to the translatyng therof.</p>
            <p>And bycause it hath pleased the lorde to giue
me more knowledge in the latyne tongue then
in the frence (wherin thys boke was fyrste
wrytten) I haue translated it after the Latine
copy, putting the faythful reader out of doubt
that I haue not in any poynte gone from the
true meanynge of the authoure, but haue tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
obserued the phrases of both tongues,
auoydynge in all that I myght the darke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of translatynge after the latine phrases, to
the intente the Englyshe reader myghte haue
the full vnderstandynge hereof wythout anye
knowledge of the latyne tongue And that the
Godly myndes of the studiouse readers may
be the more steated to reade the matter wyth
<pb facs="tcp:7580:3"/>
indifferent iudgement, I shal without dissimu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lacion
assure them that herein is no matter of
contencion at all. But cheritably wythout any
worde of reproche as well the ryght vse of the
Sacrament of the body and bloude of Christ,
as the abuses and errours concernynge the
same, are sette forth so playnelye that no man
(vnlesse he wyl wyllingly shutte vp the eyes of
his co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science agaynst the manifest trouth) can
reade the boke thorowlye, but he shall easelye
perceyue what greate abuses haue these syxe
hundreth yeares ben, and are at thys presente
daye mayntened and defended as concernynge
the ministracion therof.</p>
            <p>Fyrste for that the popyshe churche haue
and do abuse it in offeryng it vp as an health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
sacrifyce for the redemption of the soules
of the congregatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for in theyr Cannon (why
the they cal the secretes of the masse) are these
wordes. Pro redemptione animarum ecclecie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tue.
That is to saye, for the redemption of the
soules of thy churche, where they holde opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and teach, that by offerynge vp thys sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
(as they cal it) they applye to, or make par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the passion of Christe, all them that
here or hyre suche masses as they haue inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
dashed full of whysperynges, douckynges
and crossynges besydes the demure counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
in theyr tourne and halfe tourne. I wyl
speake no more as concerninge theyr fonde in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uencions
aboute the ministration of this most
sacred Sacrament. Lest I should therby be an
offence or stomblynge stocke to the weake bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
whose consciences are not yet fullye sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed
as concernynge the true beleue of thys
holy mistery, I meane leste I shoulde gyue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
occasion to do, as certeyne fonde talkers haue
<pb facs="tcp:7580:3"/>
of late dayes done and at thys presente daye
do inuent and applye to thys mooste holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramente,
names of dispitie and reproche, as
to cal it Iake in the boxe, &amp; rounde Roben, and
suche other not onely fonde but also blas phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouse
names, not onely voyed of al edificacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
(whiche ought to be the ende of al our doinges
and sayinges) but very sclau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>derouse also. For
thoughe the thynge beynge so tourned frome
the ryght vse as it is, be abhominable, so that
it is l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>afull for vs to speake vnreuerentlye of
it in the abuse: yet is it not mete for them that
professe charitie, nothinge to refrayne for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
sake. The co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>science I say of the weake
brothers not yet stronge in the trueth and so
muche the more for that many Godly mynded
persones (whiche by the persuasions of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyne
discrete and modeste brothers, haue ben
made, of Romyshe Idolaters and diligent stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes
of duncicall dregges, disciples of greate
hope in the sincere and trewe euangelyke doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine)
haue by the hearynge of these names of
reproch and dispitte, taken occasion to thynke
that the knowledge which those men dyd pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse
(whiche woulde be so outragiouse as to
mocke and iest at the remembraunce of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempcion)
coulde not procede of the spirite of
God. And haue throughe thys persuasion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tourned
to theyr olde leuen agayne, thynkyng
them to be the trew teachers of gods doctrine
whiche offende in the contrarye, makinge it so
diuine a thynge that it shoulde be of no lesse
importau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce then the whole Trinitie, the father
the so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne and holy gost, for so they affirme say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge,
that for as muche as it is the bodye of
Christe, and that Christ is in al places at ones
with his father, and his father wyth hym and
<pb facs="tcp:7580:4"/>
the holy goste: it muste neades folowe that in
it is the whole trinitie, the father, the sonne
and the holy goste. For these are not, nor can
not be seperated.</p>
            <p>I wyll saye for these men that they haue the
zeale of god, but it is not accordinge to know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.
For as the Iewes (were from tyme to
tyme,<note place="margin">Act. vii.</note> taught and beleued that God dwelled in
the temple that Solomon buylded) coulde not
abyde to heare that God shoulde not dwell in
a temple made wyth mannes hande, nothynge
consyderyng that he is immensus and can not
be conteyned (for heauen is his seate, and the
earth his fote stole) euen so these men through
a fonde persuasion of the essenciall presence of
Christe in the Sacramente: can not abyde to
heare that the whole trinitie shoulde not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
conteyned vnder a piece of breade, yea vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
euery litle crombe therof. I speke not thys
as one puttinge no difference betwene that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall
breade and oure comon breade, but
that I maye therby declare and open the great
blyndnesse of them that knowyng and confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng
the immensurable nature of God, would
haue hym reallye and naturallye conteyned in
so small a thynge.</p>
            <p>Heauen is my feate (sayth he) and the earth
is my fote stole, and yet wyll they trusse hym
so shorte that they wyll brynge hym into aly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
pire wherin a man can not tourne his fyste.</p>
            <p>He fylleth all places, and is conteyned in
no place, and yet wyll they at theyr pleasure
place hym in the chalyce, he was neuer visible
to the mortall eye, and yet wyll they make him
appere at euerye knaues requeste that wyll do
as other men do, I meane paye theyr ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye
shote, and so doyinge he shall not onelye se
<pb facs="tcp:7580:4"/>
him but also eate him vp euerye morsell
I woulde the men woulde delygentlye peruse
the wordes of saynt Augustine in theyr lege<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
on Corpus Christi daye, whiche are these ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
out of the. xxvi. treatyse vpon Iohan.<note place="margin">S. August.</note>
He that eateth my flesh and drinketh my bloud
tarieth in me and I in hym. To eate that meat
therefore, and to drinke that drinke, is to tarye
in Christe and to haue Christe tariynge in vs.
And by this he that taryeth not in Chryste and
in whom Chryst tarieth not: no doubt he doth
not spiritually eate his fleshe, nor drynke hys
bloude, al thoughe he do carnallye, and visibly
crushe with his teeth the sacrament of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> body
and bloude of Chryste but he dothe rather eate
and drynke, to his damnacion, the sacrament
of so noble a thyng. Here is your transsubstan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciacion
vtterlye denyed. For saynt Augustine
putteth a plaine difference betwene the sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and the, thinge it selfe. Agayne the same
Angustine, in the same place addeth these wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des.
The sacrament of thys thinge, that is of
the vnitie of the body and bloude of Christe is
in some places prepared euerie day, in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places but certayne dayes as on the sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye,
and is taken of the table of the Lorde, to
some persons, to life, to some other to destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
but the thynge it selfe, in to all persones,<note place="margin">Note.</note>
to lyfe, and to destruction to no man, that may
be pertaker therof, What nedeth it to reherse
anye mo wytnesses, seynge these are sufflicy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
eyther to proue saynte Augustine an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyke,
other else to declare thys transsubstanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acion
to be bothe foolyshe and abominable.</p>
            <p>Both for that it trusse the together the diuiny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
and inlargethe the humanytye, beyonde all
measure, thrutchyng vp into a corner y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arte
<pb facs="tcp:7580:5"/>
whiche no place can conteyne, and settynge at

nedes be in one place onely. Yf euery man wyl
folowe his conscience in this matter I doubte
not but they shal sone be persuaded how farre
wyde thys transsubstanciacion is frome the

so often as you eate thys breade and drynke

Here is a playne declaration of the ende &amp;

hys mooste dolorouse death &amp; preciouse bloude
moste ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teously shed vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the crosse. And who
so euer eateth &amp; drinketh it vnworthly (that is
to saye for any other purpose the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for the same
it was ordeined for) the same eateth &amp; drinketh
hys owne da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pnation. I thynke not contrarie
but y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> moste men wyl thynke this a strau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation
of this place (for as moche as the
moste auncient (yea all) y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctours that make
any mencion of this place, and Caluine hym
selfe in this boke whyche I haue translated)
do applye the vnworthynesse in receyuynge of
thys Sacrament, to the vnpenitent hert of the
persone whiche receyueth it. And in very dede
such one is farre vnworthy to receyue so wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
a Sacrament for as much as he is not the
membre nor seruaunt of Christ, but a membre
of the deuyll and seruaunt to synne. And thys
interpretation is no lesse godly then fruitfull.
For therby are the membres of Christe put in
feare to presume to come to the table of the
lorde vnlesse they haue fyrst examined &amp; found
them selues the trewe membres of Christe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
and adorned with perfyt faith, hope and
charitie. But yf we wyl go to the natyue sence
of the text: we shal perceyue, that in this place
Paule speaketh of the small regarde the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhinthians
had to thys mooste sacred Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not vsyng it wyth so much reuerence as
they ought to do. For he addeth these wordes.
Puttynge no difference of the Lordes bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
<pb facs="tcp:7580:7"/>
As he shoulde haue sayed esteamyng it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
better then the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mune bread wherwyth
they fedde theyr bodyes. The phrase of spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng
gyueth this interpretation, for yf I say.
This man was not worthely enterteyned. I
meane not that the partie whiche enterteyned
him was not worthye to enterteyne so noble a
man: but that he was not vsed as was besea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng
for such a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be vsed. So that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t vnworthely, is to receyue
it otherwyse or for an other purpose then it
oughte to be receyned for, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> is after any other

do receyue it to theyr dampnation, putting
no difference of the Lordes bodye, but vsynge
it as a matter of marchaundyse, or occupacion
to get theyr lyuynge vpon. They onely receyue
it worthely, which receiue it as a most worthy
Sacrament and signe representynge vnto vs
the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion and partipacion we haue in all
that euer Christe dyd or purchased for vs, by
taking our nature, &amp; sufferyng therin al maner
of moste miserable afflicions, &amp; finally, by hys
mooste cruel and dolorouse death. Therfore to
hoyse it ouer theyr heades, to daunce it ouer

it is not the communion of Christes body and

these assertions stande wyth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion of

of theyr erroure. They say that as Christ was
the hygh priest or bysshop, to ministre vnto his
apostles the communion of his body &amp; bloude,
whych he dyd in dead offer on the crosse to his
father: so dyd he ordayne hys apostles and in
them all that shoulde succede them: priestes to
offer vp the selfe same (saye they) to applie the
sacrifice done by Chryste wyth the merites of
the same, to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that are present ther at, or that
shall by any meanes haue it done for them. Oh
blynde bussardes. Where are youre spirituall

that hathe so moche gostely knowledge as the

wyne amonge the faythfull people, wyssynge
them to certifye them selues thereby that they
are partakers of the body and bloud of Christ.
For what sayth the text? So ofte as you shall
do thys: ye shall do it in the remembraunce of

signes. As thys beliefe and truste therfore,
<pb facs="tcp:7580:10"/>
are necessarye to the abydynge in Chryst: so is
the vse of these holye Sacramentes also, for
that it is the establyshment and confirmyng of
the sayd beleue and trust. To all them therfore
to whom this beleue and trust are necessarie:
are these sacred Sacramentes also necessary.
Where vpon I conclude that all Christians
which are of age and discresion to deserne the
fayth in Chryst: ought also to vse these moost
holy Sacramentes to establyshe and confyrme
thys fayth withall. And Chryst knowyng the
weakenes of manne, and howe hard it was to
beate into his head the vnderstandyng of the
hygh mystery of the perticipation and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
that all faythfull shoulde haue in hys me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites:
vsed these visible signes, that we myght
in them (euen with oure senses) perceyue this
wonderful distribucion of the body and bloud
of Chryst amonge his faythfull, whyche oure
grosse nature coulde no more compasse wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
these visible sygnes, then the carnall and
fleshly Iewes coulde when Chryst tolde them
of the eatyng of his flesh and drynkyng of his
bloud by beleuyng in hym. To helpe our weke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes therfor, it pleased the almyghtie wysdome
of the Lorde, to declare vnto vs by our senses,
the thyng that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same senses caused the Iewes
to abhorre. The maner I saye of oure pertici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
and communion in Chryst and all that
euer he deserued for vs. For euen as we se that
we beyng many are partakers of one loofe of
breade, by eatynge therof, and of one cuppe of
wyne by drynkyng thereof: so are we certified
by that participation, that we (beyng manye)
beleuynge in Chryst: are by that belefe, made
partakers of Chryste, and wyth Chryste in al
that is his, none otherwyse then all the mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bres
<pb facs="tcp:7580:10"/>
of one bodye be partakers of all ioyes
and pleasures that chaunce to the heade. For
as the lofe wherof we eate is made of manye
graynes: and the Cuppe of wyne wherof we
drynke is made of manye grapes, and yet is
but one Cuppe of wyne, and the lofe but one
lofe: euen so are we that beleue in Christe, but
one bodye wyth hym and he oure heade, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wythstandyng
we be manye in numbre, and
of diuerse nacions, estates and condicions.</p>

            <p>And as in the bodye is no membre wher vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

is there none estate or condicion but it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
yea necessarye to the other. Thys is
a greate misterye (sayeth Paule) the misterye
I saye of Christe and hys congregacion, for
it is hys bodye,<note place="margin">Thesalo. v.</note> of hys fleshe and of hys bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
Not that the congregacion or churche
is that naturall bodye that dyed on the crosse,
nor we (the members of the same churche)
the fleshe and bones of the same: But for
that it was that congregacion, it was we (the
membres of thys churche) that caused Christe
to take oure nature vpon hym, that therein
he myghte satisfye for oure synnes, makynge
vs partakers wyth hym in thys satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and so are we hys bodye and mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres,

the spirite shall minister vnto vs abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntly,

we be partakers of the bodye and bloude of
him that hath produced these thynges, and gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen

            <p>Nowe entre we into that question, whiche
hath bene so greatly tossed both in tyme paste
and in these oure dayes also: howe those wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
are to be vnderstande, wherin Christe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
his bodye breade, and hys bloude wyne.
Whiche wordes maye easely be opened, yf we
kepe in memorye those principles whyche I
haue before set forth: that is to saye, that all
the fruite we seke for in the supper, is brought
to noughte, onlesse Christe be gyuen vnto vs
therin, as the foundacion and substance of all
the whole matter. And yf we ones graunt this
thynge, then no doubt we shall grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t also, that
there is gyuen vnto vs nought els but an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable

<pb facs="tcp:7580:17"/>
Christ: whiche thynge were execrable &amp; shame
full blasphemye. Forthermore, yf the maner of
the communion with Christ be suche that we
be partakers of all the mercies and benifites
which he gate for vs by his death: then are we
not partakers w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the spirite onely but w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>boode
also: wherin he perfourmed perfit obedi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence
to God the father, to the intent he mighte
paye oure det es. Althoughe, to saye the truth
the one can not be wythoute the other. For
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he geueth him selfe vnto vs, he doth it to
the intent we shoulde possese him whole. And
therfore, as I haue sayde, that his spirite is
oure life: euen so doth he his owne mouth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that hys fleshe is oure foode,<note place="margin">The mouthe of the soule (y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> receiueth this fode) is fayth.</note> and his

in vayne, no remedy oure life must neades
consiste in him, and oure soules be nourished
wyth hys fleshe and bloude, as wyth theyr
proper and peculyar foode. Of that thynge
haue we testimony in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> supper, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is sayd
of the breade that we should take it and eate it
and that it is his bodye: and of the cuppe, that

the bodye and bloude named, to the intent we

lyfe therin. Now yf any man woulde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mande
of me whether the breade be the bodye

I answer, that the breade and wy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

bloude of Christe, and that they be called the

            <p>For not wythstandynge that oureeyes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

nor oure wyttes can not comprehende the com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>munion
that wee haue in the bodye of Christe
yet is it there openlye shewed before oure eyes.
We haue, in a lyke thynge, an example verye
fytte for the purpose. When the lorde woulde
that his spirite should appeare in the baptisme
of Christe, he shewed him vnder the shape of a
doue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Iohn the Baptyste recytyng that hysto<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rye
sayeth that he sawe the holye Gost descen
dynge. But yf we marke it well, we shal fynde
that he sawe nought els but a Doue. For the
substance of the holy Gooste is muisible.</p>
            <p>But for that he knewe that vision to be no
vayne figure, but the mooste sure token of the
prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of the holy goost: he doubted nothyng
at all to affirme that he sawe him: because he
was represented vnto him vnder soche sort as
he was able to abyde. Euen so must we say as
concernynge the communion that we haue in
the bodye and bloude of Christe. It is a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
misterye, whyche can neyther be sene
wyth the eyes, nother comprehended with the

requireth, it is set forth wyth visible fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures
and signes: but yet vnder such sort that
it is not a bare and simple figure, but ioyned

whan they be receyued so as they oughte

            <p>Nowe muste we come to the thyrde of the
chiefe partes whyche we haue purposed in the
begynnynge of thys lytle boke, that is to saye
to the ryght vse, that we maye reuerentlye ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue
the institution of the Lorde. For who
so euer cometh vnto thys sacrament, wyth a
certayne comtempte, negligentlye or wythout
regarde, nothynge carefull to holde hys pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,
and to perseuer in that where in the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
hath called hym: he dothe frowardlye abuse
it, and in abusynge fylthyly contaminate it.</p>
            <p>But to contaminate and pollute the thynge
that god hath so holyly consecrated, is a great
and intollerable sacriledge. Neyther is it in
vayne that Paule declareth so greuouse and
cruell dampnation to all them that receyue it
vnworthelye. For yf there be nothinge, either
in heauen, eyther in earh, that is more worthy
then the bodye and bloude of the Lord: it is no
smal faute to dispice it,<note place="margin">Note what it is to receyue a Sacrament vnworthyly.</note> and to receyue it wyth<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out
consyderation, and to come thyther not
well and diligentlye prepared. Forthermore,
he dothe aduertise vs to proue our selues, that
we maye vse it euen as the thynge requyreth.
Yf so be that we vnderstande what probati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that oughte to be: we shall also perceyue
what vse that is whych we loke for, but great
and wyse circumspection muste be had in this
thynge. For as we can not be to diligent in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminynge

daungerouse anxietie, yea rather into
horrible tormentes. And to be delyuered from
these inrollynges of perturbacions, we muste
(as I haue sayde before) reduce all thynges to
the institution of the Lorde, as to the rule,
whiche yf we folowe, wee shall neyther slyde
nor erre. And folowynge it we ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syder
whether we fele in our selues vnfayned
repentaunce and fayth. Whyche two are so
ioyned betwene them selues, that it is not pos<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sible
that the one can by any meanes con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>yste
wythout the other. For yf we do suppose that
our lyfe remayneth in Christe: then muste wee
acknowledge that in our selues we are deade.</p>
            <p>Yf we seke oure force and strength in hym:
then must we vnderstande that we destituted
of all strength, do faynte. Yf we put all oure
felicitie in his mercy: we must neades perceiue
howe great our misery is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that is a way.
Yf our quietnesse &amp; tranquilite be reposed in
him: the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> must we feele nought els in our selues

And such affection can not be in vs but

vpon the begynnyng, but increasynge by

called the supper a sacrifice. But they showe a
reason why, because the death of Christ is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented

this purpose, that because the supper is the me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morie
of that onlye sacrifice, wherin we ought
vtterlye to content oure selues, therfore is that
name attributed. Neyther can I blame the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
of the olde congregacion, because they
did in theyr gesture &amp; riete figurate a certaine
ymage of a sacrifice, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the same cerimonies in

               </gap>fice. Whyche thinge
for that it pricketh to nere the Iewyshe marke
and is not agreable to the institution of the
Lorde, I do not alowe it.</p>
            <p>For in the olde testament (the tyme of figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res)
the lorde instituted such ceremonies, to be
obserued, vntyll that sacrifyce were celebrated
in the fleshe of his moste deare beloued sonne,
whyche was the truth of them all.</p>
            <p>Seynge therfore, all thys is finished, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayneth
no more but that we vse the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
therof. It is therfore superfluous, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
that thynge, wyth figures. Therfore, by
the instruction of Christ, we are not commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to offer or sacrifyce:<note place="margin">Then is the masse the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes sacrifice.</note> but to take and eate
the thinge that is al ready offered and sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced.
And although the au<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cientes, dyd somwhat
offende in that obseruation: yet was not the
impietie so great as that which dyd afterward
crepe in. For the thynge that was proper and
peculiar to the death of Christe, was vtterlye
transposed to the masse: that it myght satisfye
to god for our offences, &amp; that we myght be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concyled
by it. Besydes these thynges, that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
whyche was Christes, was attributed vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>to
them which called them selues priestes that
they myghte sacrifyce vnto god, and that they
myght praye before hym wyth theyr sacrifices
to optayne pardone and remission of oure sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
I wyl not disse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble in these solucio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s which

That the masse is no newe sacrifyce,<note place="margin">The Diuels solusion.</note> but

to couer theyr abhominacion wyth some ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

it shall be euident, that al those masses
wherin is no suche communion of the supper

of the olde congregation: and therfore can it
by no meanes agree or stande with the wordes
of the lorde. Is not suche an interpretacion to
violent and to muche wrasted? To saye, that
when Christ shewynge bread, calleth it his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye,
the substance of the bread is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that the bodye of Christe succedeth in the place
thereof? But it neadeth not to call the matter
into question, seinge that the bryght &amp; splendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferouse
veritie is of it selfe able to confute so
absurde a vanitie. I let passe infinite testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes
both of the scripture and of the fathers
also, wherin the sacramente is called breade. I
saye this onely, that the nature of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
requireth: that the material bread remayne
for the visible signe of the body For it is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall
rule amonge y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes: that the sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
whiche we se in them, ought to haue some
similitude wyth the spirituall thinge that they
represent. As we are therfore in baptisme, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed
that oure soules be inwardlye washed,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the water, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> washeth the fylth of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,

euen so must there neades be in the supper ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teriall
breade, that it may be declared vnto vs
that the bodye of Christe is oure foode. For
what declaracyon were it, yf the qualitie wyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
shoulde represent vnto vs that body. We
knowe therfore manifestlye, that vnlesse the
substance of bread do there remayne, al the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentacion,
whiche the lorde (wyllynge to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
hym selfe to oure infirmitie) gaue
vnto vs: doth vtterly decaye and peryshe.</p>
            <p>For the wordes which the lorde spake sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de
no lesse then yf one woulde saye.<note place="margin">Let ne what these wordes this is my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, do signifi.</note> In lyke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

wherwyth the soules be quyckened. Besydes
these thynges. For what purpose doth Paule
propone that similitude? as one lofe is made
of many graynes, mingled and ioyned to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
one wyth an other: euen so wee (for as
muche as we take parte al of one bread) ought
to be faste ioyned togyther one with an other.
And yf the whytnesse onelye shoulde remayne
wythout the substance, were it not a thyng to
be laughed at to here a man speake as Paule
doth? Wherfore wythout any doubtyng at al
I conclude that thys transsubstanciacion is
the deuylles interpretation, to depraue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> truth
of the supper.</p>
            <p>Many dotynge castes haue folowed of this

not be denyed, but that in the popyshe church,
was receyued both of high and lowe, and is at
this day with fyre, sworde, murder, &amp; al kynde
of tormentes cruelly defended and holden, this
opinion: that Christe is conteyned vnder these

that lyke as in earth Christ toke our humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
euen so, he pluckynge the same out of thys

               </gap>ure therof, caryed it vp into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And
for thys cause oughte we when we speake of
the humanitie of Christ, to consider two thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
The fyrste, that we diminishe nothinge of
the veritie of his nature. The other, that we
derogate nothynge of his glorious estate. And
to do thys thynge in his kynde, we muste lefte
vp our myndes into heauen, that we may seke
out redeamer there. For yf we wyll caste hym
frome vs vnder the corruptible Elementes of
thys worlde:<note place="margin">Breade and wyne are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible.</note> we shall both destroye those thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
whiche the scriptures do wytnes as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his humane nature: and also bringe to
nought his moste glorious ascension. But by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
many me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue abundantly handled this
matter: I had rather let it passe then to wade,
further therin. My mynde was to note, by the
waye, thys thynge onely. That to thynke that
Christ is shutte vp vnder the bread and wine,
other els to ioyne the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so togither, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> our mynde
cleaue fast there and is not erected into heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:
is a diuelyshe dottage, whyche thynge I shall
also toutche in an other place. And when thys
peruerse opinion was once receyued, it ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
many other supersticions. Fyrst that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
<pb facs="tcp:7580:28"/>
adoracion, which is none other thyng but
mere idolatry. For yf a man woulde prostrate
him selfe before the breade, and honour Christ
there, as yf he were there presente, conteyned
therin: were not that the setting vp of an idole
in steade of the Sacrament? For we were not
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded to honour, but to eate. We ought
not therfore so rashely to attempt that thinge.
Forthermore thys was an obseruation in the
olde congregacion, to admonishe the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the supper shoulde be celebrated, that they
lyfte vp theyr hertes, to the intent they shoulde
vnderstande, that they oughte not to styke in
the visible signe,<note place="margin">Understande this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aright.</note> yf they would honour Christ
a right. But we shal not long contende as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernynge
thys article: yf the presence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
of the veritie wyth the signe be well
vnderstande: wherof I haue all readye spoken
and wyl hereafter declare at large. Out of the
same fountayne are sprongen the residewe of
the supersticiouse ceremonies: as to carye the
Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thorow the stretes once in the yere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
as it were in a pompe, an other season to set
vp a taberancle for it, and to kepe it al the yere
longe shutte vp in a pire or case, that the people
maye giue hede there vnto as vnto god, which
shynges bycause they are all not onely inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by mans wytie without the worde of god,
but also playne repugnante to the institucion
of the supper: they ought of all Christians vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
to be reiected.</p>
            <p>I haue declared whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>se thys calamity of the
papisticall churche, that the people doth all the
yeare longe absteyne from the communion of
the supper, had hys begynnynge: bycause it is
counted as a sacrifice whyche one man muste
offer vp in the name of the whole multitude.
<pb facs="tcp:7580:29"/>
But although we maye vse it but once euerye
yere, yet it is then miserably pulled in sunder, &amp;
as it were torne in pieces. For where as the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament
of the bloude ought to be distributed
to the people, as it apeareth by the expresse co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement

            <p>Wherin we maye easelye perceyue, wyth
what foole hardinesse and frowardnesse the

in his body: and then comynge to the cuppe
he sayed not onely drynke ye, but he added ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prestely,
al. Woulde we haue a thynge spoken
more openly? he byddeth vs eate the breade v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synge
no vniuersall worde therin. But of the
cuppe he byddeth vs all drynke. Whense co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
thys difference: but that he entended ther
by to preuent thys malyce and subtyl crafte of
the dyuell? Neuerthelesse, the pope is of suche
arrogancye and pryde: that he dare be bolde
to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde to the contrarye: loke that ye do

As though the Lorde had not bene of

For yf the one part maye be lefte as superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:
it had bene folyshe and vayne for both to

some of the popes bande, perceyuyng that this
so greate abhominacion coulde not otherwyse
be defe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded then impudentlye, went aboute to
couer it by some other meanes. They say,<note place="margin">The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he spake not to oure pristes.</note> that
when Christe instituted this Sacramente, he
spake vnto his apostles onelye who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had as
then promoted to the order of priesthode. But
what answer wyl they make to Paule, which
sayeth, that he hath taught the christen people
the thing that he learned of the lorde, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one should eate of the bread &amp; drynke of the
cuppe? But who hath reueyled vnto these men
that Christe gaue the supper vnto his apostles
as vnto priestes? The wordes sou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

in that he doth afterwarde co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunde,
that they folowing his example, shoulde do the

<pb facs="tcp:7580:30"/>
woulde shoulde continewe in his churche for
euer. And thys rule was in the auncient tyme
obserued: vnto suche time as Antichrist ruling
alone, auaunced him selfe, and stretched vp his
hornes agaynste God vertitie, to the intent to
destroy it vtterly. We se therfore that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
the more briefely: I wyll comprehende in

some vnprofitable, some also noysome &amp; daun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gerouse:

in y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> popish church in steade of the supper, if I
shoulde define it a righte, is none other thinge,
then a mere apishe emulation &amp; disguised mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
I cal it an apishe emulacion, bicause that
like as apes do play the wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tons in imitatyng,
rudely &amp; without reason, the workes of men:
eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> so do they imitate the Lordes holy supper

               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions,
they corrupte the hole truth therof. And
to declare this to be true, is not thys the chiefe
thynge hat the Lorde lefte with vs, that we

is pronunced, but bicause it is vnderstande &amp;c.
Wherby he declareth that the sacramentes do
take theyr force and energy of the word of the
lorde: when it is preached after suche sorte as
it maye be vnderstanded. The residewe, is not
worthy the name of a sacramente. But in the
masse, it is so farre vnlyke that any doctrine
should be intelligibly harde, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary wyse
al the whole mistery is thought to be propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
vnlesse all thinges be sayd and done priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
&amp; couertly to the intent nothing may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyued

For after the maner of an inchau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter, they
thynke that wyth whysperynges &amp; diuers ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures,
they brynge Christe out of heauen into

prophanacion of the supper, then the obserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
therof: and that the peculier and chief sub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>stance
of the supper wanteth: which consisteth
in thys thynge, that the mistery be truely ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to the people, and the promesses rehersed
wyth open voyce: not that the priest: wyth out
other reason or vnderstandyng, shoulde stylly
whysper out an hummyng that can not be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstande.
I call it a play or maskyng, bycause
there is nought els sene but the folyshnes and
gestures of players, which thinges woulde be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a playe muche better then the sacred sup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>per

olde testament were celebrated with diuers or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namentes
&amp; ceremonies. But bicause they had

a good significacion, and were all ordeyned to
instructe and exersice the people in godlynesse:
they were far vnlike vnto these, which serue
for none other purpose at all, but that wyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

            <p>For yf I laye for me this one thyng, what
so euer was then doone was founded on the
commaundement of God: and that theyr foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyshe

on mans inuencion: were not there a great dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ference?
But I haue thynges to disproue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
wyth, that be moch greater then these be. For
it was not for naught that the lord prescribed
such a forme for a tyme, to the intent that at y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>

No doubt because he had not as then declared
hys doctrine so playnly, he woulde so moche
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> rather y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> his people shold be exercised in figu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ers:
that the thynge whych wanted in that te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament,

sense that Christ apeared in the fleshe: loke by
howe moche more the doctrine is lyghtened, so
moch more are the figures diminished. Seyng
therfore we haue the bodye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we must leaue the

cerimonies: we shal patche agayne that
vaile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that Christ brake in sonder by his death
and so shall we obscure and darken the lyght

multitude of cerimones, whych is sene in the

masse, is the forme of the Iewyshe law, vtter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
contrarie to the christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> relygyon. I am not

they ought in no case to graunte that the bread
is transsubstanciated (as they say) into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye

            <p>Hense shal it come to passe that they shall

they shal iudge the institucio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the lorde to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violated
and broken, in that the people is rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
of the one parte of the sacrament: and that
it is necessarie, that bothe partes be wholy dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed,
yf it shoulde be obserued aryght, In
fyne, they shal suppose, that it is not onely su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluouse

becometh not the chrystian religyon, to vse so
many cerimonies, take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Iewes, more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the symplicitie wherin the apostles instructed

no doctrine at al may there be herde, but is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
buryed, as though it were a certeyne kind
of magycall arte. To conclude at the laste, wee
<pb facs="tcp:7580:32"/>
must now come to the last of the chiefe partes.
That is to saye,<note place="margin">Yet by thys was y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> trueth tried out.</note> to that contencion whyche in
oure tyme is steared in this matter, whiche for
as much as no doubt it was of the deuils stea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng
vpon to let, or rather to breake the course
of the Gospell, I woulde wyshe it to be forgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
for euer: much lesse can I be delyted in the

            <p>But bycause I do perceyue very many god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
myndes: which know not whyther to turne
them selues: I wyll briefely say the thyng that
I shall thynke necessarye to declare howe they
maye delyuer them selues.</p>
            <p>Fyrste I desyre and beseche al faythfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sones
euen for the names sake of the lyuynge
God, that they be not greatly offended, bicause
thys controuersy is moued amonge them that
were the chiefe capiteynes, in restorynge and
brynging in agayne of the doctrine of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.
For it is no new thinge for the lorde to suf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fer
his seruau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes to be ignorant in some thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges:
and suffer them to contende amonge them
selues: not that he woulde suffer them to erre
continuallye, but for a tyme:<note place="margin">The apostles varyed in some thinges</note> to the intente he
myght make them more humble. And no doubt
yf all thynges had chaunced prosperoussye to
thys daye, and had flowed accordynge to oure

them selues: other els the mercy of god shoulde
not haue ben so muche knowen as it ought to
be. And therfore the lordes wyll was to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waye
from men aloccasyon of gloriynge: that
glory myght be gyuen vnto hym onely.</p>
            <p>Forthermore, yf we consyder wyth howe
greate darkenesse the worlde was beset, when
they whiche moued this controuersy, beganne
to leade vs backe againe to the light of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie:
<pb facs="tcp:7580:33"/>
in dede we wyll merueyle nothynge at all

               </gap> all thynges euen from
the begynnynge. It is rather a notable miracle
of god, that they, in so litle space of time, were
so illumined, that they them selues myghte es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
&amp; leade other out of that synke of errours
wherin we had ben so longe tyme drowned.</p>
            <p>But there is no better waye, then to reherse
the matter it selfe euen as it was done. For
therby it shal apeare, that there is not so much
matter of offence in thys behalfe, as is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
supposed to be.</p>
            <p>When Luther beganne to teache, he hande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the matter of the supper so, that as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernynge
the corporall presence of Christe, he
seamed to leaue it suche, as all men dyd then
conceyue. For condemnynge transsubstancia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
he sayed that the breade was the bodye of
Christe, bycause it was ioyned togyther wyth
hym. Besydes thys, he added certeyne harde
and grosse similitudes. But that he dyd by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion,
bycause he coulde not otherwyse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
his mynde. For it is an harde thynge to
expounde so harde a matter: and not to vse
some thynges, not all of the fittest for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose.
After this dyd zuinglius, and Ecolampa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius
begynne to growe. Whyche when they
consydered the gyle and disceyt that the deuyll
bad brought in, inestablishing that carnall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence:

hundreth yeres before: they supposed it wyc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse
to dissemble a matter of so greate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portaunce.
And chiefely bycause there was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nxed
vnto thys erro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that Christe shoulde be worshypped as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded

was verye harde, to pull backe thys opinion,
<pb facs="tcp:7580:33"/>
whiche had ben longe &amp; deaplie roted in the her<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tes
of men, they applyed all the force of there
wytte, to impugne the same, teachynge that
it was a most grose and absurde <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rroure not
to acknowledge those thinges whiche be thro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ughout

But whylse they were very moche bente vnto
this purpose: they omited to declare what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence
of Chryste in the supper we ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue,
&amp; what communio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his body and bloud

haue come to some co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>corde, they recoyled more
and more: myndyng nought els but to defende
theyr opinion and to confute the contrary, we
perceyue therfore in what thing Luther erred
and also wherin zinglius and Ecolampadius
dyd erre: It was Luthers duetie: at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
to admonish that it was not his purpose
to stablyshe suche a locall presence as the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pistes
do dreame. Also, to proteste y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> he soughte

those rude similitudes, most hard to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standed:
or els to vse them moderatlye, and to
interprete them so, that they myghte not haue
ben cause of any offence. To conclude, sence
that contention was moued, he passed al mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure

in rebukynge other, wyth to much<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

to his accustomed vehemency, to the
intent to impugne them that helde the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye,
he vsed incredible fourmes of speakynge:
whiche coulde not well be suffered of them
whose mindes were but sklenderly appoynted
to gyue credence to him. The other also, offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in that they did sticke so styefely in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnynge
of that supersticiouse and fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

            <p>For notwythstanding that they denyed not

To conclude, seyng that we knowe they were
both of Godly conuersacion and excellent do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,
and that they also whiche at this daye

            <p>And chieflye because it hath pleased oure lorde
