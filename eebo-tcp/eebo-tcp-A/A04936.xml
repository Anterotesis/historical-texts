            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE chiefeſt thing (Right Honorable and my ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular good Lord) that emboldneth men to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, their labours vnto any perſonage, is the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitie betweene the matter of the worke, which they offer, and the minde of him to whom it is preſented. And as the auncient comicall Poetes were wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to pen ſuch Enterludes, as they thought would be plauſibly heard of their auditory: ſoe our common writers doe faſhion and ſhape the ſubiect of which they entreat, according to the affection of him, whoſe patronage they require in countenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing their writings: this (I ſay) though it be practiſed of all writers now a daies, and migt haue ſerued as a fitte preſident for me to haue follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed: yet haue I ſwarued and digreſſed from ſo generall a cuſtome, in preferring this labour of mine to the vewe of your Honor (the matter ſo far diſſenting from your Honors diſpoſitions) ſo that as it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not without ſom colour be obiected, that I might haue prouided far better (had I bene any way ſufficient) both for the acceptation of my labour, &amp; alſo for the fit anſwering of your Honors affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if I had treated of the politick gouernment of our contry, &amp; of the weilding of a commonwealth: to the neceſſity of which calling, not Fortune the Queene of the old Philoſophers, but God himſelfe hath called, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enforced you if that opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Plato be true, that euery good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate taketh vpon him his office vnwillingly. But that obiection will ſone be taken away, if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſider how fooliſh a thing it were to inſtruct
<pb facs="tcp:13038:3"/>
him with his imaginarie precepts, whom (beſides a great light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) moſt happie experience hath made a perfect &amp; abſolute gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Plato that moſt graue and wiſe deemer of the ſtate tyrannicall, was ſo many times conuicted of follie, howe often he aduentured in the preſence of kinges to diſcourſe of the regiment of a common wealth. Dionyſius (of whom it was doubted, whether he did more harme by his extreame crueltie, or good by his prouident wiſedome which both he left alike to his ſucceſſours to imitate) called that nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Philoſopher (whom I euen now named) in Scicilia of purpoſe to heare him, and with great patience liſtened to him, as he diſputed of mannes felicitie and admired him as he handled thoſe morall vertues, which Socrates his maiſter was feigned to haue brought from heauen, and as he treated of the frame &amp; machine of the world: but on a time (taking aduauntage by the kinges attention) when he had ſtolne into the diſcourſe of pollicie, Dionyſius felt himſelfe ſo moued, that he had exerciſed his tyrannie againſt him alſo, if Dio and Ariſtomanes had not recouered him out of his iawes, and ſo ridde him out of the land, by ſelling him to Polis the Lacedemonian marchaunt. And this was the verdict, that the wiſe king (when his furie was ſomewhat calmed) gaue of that moſt learned Philoſopher for his holeſome counſell (as he thought) namely, that his diſcourſes ſeemed vnto him to be the prattles of idle olde men: ſo much experience diſdaineth to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled by arte, and ſo impatient is he of inſtitution, whoſe knowledg is acquired Vſu &amp; Memoria, (the two auncient parentes of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.) VVhat a great argument of follie therefore ſhall he giue, that ſhall go about to lay a plot for your Honor, from whence you may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riue an example of gouernment, who haue ſo many yeares in ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome a common wealth, and to the moſt wiſe &amp; vertuous Princeſſe in the world ben reteined as a moſt honorable and graue counſellour? I will not ſay, as Zopyrus vnto Darius, or as Cineas vnto his Pyrrhus, or as Creſus vnto his Cyrus, the one of which by pollicie aduiſed his king to circumuent his enemies, the other allured them to his ſubie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by his eloquence, &amp; the third by his own vnfortunat experience directed him howe to conuey any daungerous enterpriſe. All which ſerued their Princes to none other vſe, but to helpe them to purchaſe the worſt part of glorie by bloudie oppreſſion: but rather as a Neſtor vnto his Agamemnon, as a Zenophon vnto his Cyrus, &amp; as a Plutarch
<pb facs="tcp:13038:3"/>
vnto his Traian, which thought it not ſo glorious to tie their enemies to them by forced feare, as their friends and neighbours by peaceable amitie, the ſtrongeſt gard that Princes can truſt vnto. I muſt needes confeſſe that theſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pariſons do faile in repreſenting ſo much as I do conceiue, for that I may not feare the ſuſpitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of flatterie in ſo manifeſt a truth, can the whole Scene of mans life ſo gorgeouſlie &amp; ſtately ſet forth by the hiſtoria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of ſeueral ages, ſhew vs at one time, on one ſtage two ſuch notable actors (namely) ſo redoubted, ſo pereleſſe, &amp; ſo ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous a Princeſſe holding the ſcepter, ſo graue, ſo wiſe, &amp; ſo prouident a counſeller ſuſteyning the perſon of Eubolus? I would I might (my credit ſaued with your Honor) perſue your prayſes yet further, but I know very well, that you (who with an vnwearied affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do not ceaſe continually to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit ſuch vertuous deedes as deſerue to be eternized for euer, are ſone tired, when you heare them remembred by another. And truely I would not haue ſpoken ſo much for feare of offence, but that I know for a certainety, that you aſcribe the being of your vertues to God the giuer of al good things, befor who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to extenuat our graces, I know not whither it be more blame worthy, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhameleſly to aſſume vnto our ſelues, whatſoeuer is wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gfully attributed vnto vs by our flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds. But to what end (will you ſaie) are all theſe words? name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to this: to excuſe my ſelfe, in that I haue not laboured to fit your affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the preſentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of this my labour, which is ſo impoſſible, in reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of your ſingular knowledg in al kind of good lerning, that there is no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo ſelfwiſe or loftie, which feareth not to come vnder your lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned cenſure. VVhich excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of yours when I had loked into, &amp; had found my ſelfe altogether vnable to anſwere: I purpoſed (as I thought) more politicklie to aſſaie your humanitie, which (in deed) graceth all the reſt of your vertues, which (I thought) I might ſone abuſe in offering ſuch a ſubiect, in which ſome ſtudy, &amp; induſtrie (beſides many yeares had made me in part able to iudge, &amp; ſuch a one, as the earneſt affaires of the Common wealth, in which you are alwayes buſied, togeather with the inconuenient vneaſines of the ſtudie hath kepte your Honor from being acquainted with. VVhich bold attempt of mine, your wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſhall ſo much the eaſier be brought to pardon, by how much the more erneſtly your rare clemencie encouraged me to enterpriſe it: for I do plainely confeſſe, that I haue not thought this Booke of mine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be peruſed of your Honor, aſwell becauſe of mine owne vnabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

who am altogeither inſufficient to performe any thing that your Ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nor may like of, as alſo in reſpect of thoſe manifold graces, wherewith the Lord hath filled you: by the vertue of which you could in a tongue (farre more eloquent then this of ours) diſcerne and know the ſecrets of phiſicke which I haue now in part reuealed: If the common weale of vs all did not rather cary you away, then that delight which is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reaped by priuate ſtudy. And yet neuertheleſſe, when I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with my ſelfe, that it was not the affectation of any popular praiſe, but an honeſt zeale to benefite my countrimen, which begotte in me this deſire to publiſh this worke, and alſo (yf I may without the ſuſpect of vaine glorie ſeeme to diuine of the iſſue of my laboures) perceiuing that they might bring ſome commodity vnto the more ignorant ſorte of our common Practicioners &amp; Aemperiques (if they were with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence peruſed:) and thirdly, when I perceiued in my ſelfe a certaine earneſt willingnes which I haue alwayes had (though of late it hath bene more vehemently inflamed) to commend ſome peece of ſeruice vnto your Honor: (I ſay) theſe cauſes meeting thus together did eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially adduce me (though many doubtes ſtept afore me in mine enterpriſe, offring to reenforce my ouer preſumptuous determinatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) with ſuch a bold confidency as it were to ruſh into your preſence, and to demaund without any ſhew of merite your Honors moſt fauorable Protection, that this booke of mine (vnable of it ſelfe) may run vnder your Patronage, which as it were Gorgon his buckler, I will obuert and turne againſt all the venemous bitinges of ſclanderous tongues. The Lord God, (who hath made you a notable inſtrument to worke the aduauncement of his glorie, the furtheraunce and propagation of good learning) lengthen &amp; protract your life beyond your fatall period, and giue you a will to liue, a deſire ſtill to beare vp that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, which her Maieſtie hath laid vpon your ſhoulders, &amp; with theſe, all good ſucceſſe in this world, and eternall happines in his kingdom.</p>

This fable proceeding (I knovv not from vvhat braine) is remembred of Philo the levv, in his treatiſe of the vvorld vvhich ſeemeth to implie thus much, that as there is nothing vvithin this mortall circuite, that God hath, as it vvere kept to himſelfe, and not made ſubiect to the induſtrious ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie of man: ſo there is no meanes by vvhich a man can approch neerer vnto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of that nature vvhich he firſt enioyed, and then loſt by his fall, then by the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full indagation of the ſecretes of nature, or anie vvaie, vvhereby he may more truely glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie his maker, then in his life time vvith his tongue to communicate that knovvledge vvhich he hath by his induſtrie atcheiued, and to haue a care alſo, that it may be faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commended to his poſteritie. And doubtleſſe this vvas the conſideration, that moued the vviſe king Solomon to vvade ſo far in the ſearching of the cauſes of thinges, vvho abandoning all thoſe gliſtering shevves vvhich his riches and kingdome profered him, applied his minde to the ſtudie of nature, &amp; compiled a great volume, vvherin he larglie diſcourſed not onely of birdes and beaſtes, but of all herbes and trees, euen from the cedar in Libanon, to Hiſop that ſpringeth out of the vvall. And the ſelfe ſame opinion of the excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of that kinde of life hath from time to time inuaded the mindes of many kings &amp; noble perſonages, vovving to them ſelues vvithout any light of their forefathers, to go through the cloudie darkneſſe of nature. And althoug they ſomtime ſtumbled, yet are they to be pardoned, if vve conſider both the obſcuritie and the length of the vvaie they vvent in. Zoroaſtes the reputed ſonne of Noie vvas the firſt, that of manie confuſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, began to fashion out &amp; as it vvere to delineat the beginning of an art by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting dovvn cartaine preceptes of the ſame, &amp; after him Oſiris the king of AEgypt, and Zeſoſtris alſo king of the ſame contry (though rudlie) laid the foundatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Aſtronomie by demonſtration of the courſe of the heauens, &amp; of phiſicke by opening the nature of manie herbes, and alſo of the ſecretes of their vvater of Nilus. To the vvorthines of vvhich ſecrete, Plato that great philoſopher did vvillingly ſubſcribe, vvhen falling into a grieuous maladie in AEgypt, and beng not able by his ovvne experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes (though he had aſſaied many) to cure him ſelfe, he vvas preſerued by the Prieſtes of that countrie, vvho taught him the vertue of their vvater, vvhereas af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in remembraunce of this benefitte, he vvrote this verſe, rehearſed by Laer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius: Mare vniuerſa proluit hominum mala: the ſea doth vvaſhe avvaie all the infirmities of man. So that by this vve may ſee, that this noble and learned Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher

had neuer brought vs nevves out of AEgypt, either of ther pollicie &amp; gouernment of their countrie, or of the rare and exquiſite knovvledge in Aſtronomie, if he had not taſted of the benefit, vvhich the Phyſicke of that time affoorded him. But vve vvill remember ſome of thoſe kinges, vvho had an eſpeciall fantſie to this art, vvhoſe names are de<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

And Mithridates the king of Pontus shall be the firſt, vvho at one time vndertoke tvvo mighty battels the one vvith the Remaines, the other vvith nature. In the laſt of vvhich the more daungerous he preuailed like a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querour, and in the firſt he dealt ſo valiantly, that the glorie of his forepaſſed victories ſuppreſſed &amp; killed the remembraunce of his laſt ouerthrovv. The vvhich (as Plinie remembreth) vvas a like profitable to the common vvealth and to mans life: for in his mannour vvhere he lay, there vvere founde many bookes vvritten by his ovvne handes, both of the vertues of herbes and of the conſtitution of mans bodie, vvith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies of many infirmities of the ſame. Euax alſo the king of Arabia vvrot a booke of the effectes of ſimples, vvhich he dedicated to Nero the Emperour. But vvhat should I recken perticularly the names of euerie one, vvhen in former ages there vvas no king, either of AEthiopia, AEgypt, or Arabia, vvho did not himſelfe either vvrite ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvhat concerning this art of Phyſicke, or elſe by his liberalitie encouraged others to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploie their times in the ſame? vvhich may make much (no doubt) to the credite of the arte, vvhen as kinges haue appropriated it to themſelues, and haue thought themſelues honoured by the profeſsion of the ſame. And as many argumentes do induce me to beleeue beſides the vvitneſſe of the Hiſtorians, that Phyſicke is the arte, vvherein many kings haue trauailed and delighted: ſo nothing more ſtrongly then this, that vvhereas other gods vvere tyed to their ſeuerall places, as Iupiter to Elis, Diana to Epheſus, Apollo to Delos, and ſo forth. AEſculapius the ſonne of Apollo by the daughter of Phlegias made a god for his cunning in Phyſicke, hath his temple and altars euerie vvhere in Corinth, in Lacedemon, in Athens, in Thebes, in Epidaure, in Arcadia, Meſſenia, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other countries (as Pauſanias remembreth) all vvhich honours vvhich vvere done to him (no doubt) vvere inſtituted by the kings and rulers of thoſe countries, vho eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially fauored that arte, thinking it great reaſon, that he vvho inuented an arte ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally auailable for mankinde, should be generally honoured of all men. And (I pray you) hovv much inferiour vvas the reno<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ne of Hippocrates, vvho deſcended of his lyne, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that the one vvas placed amongeſt the gods in heauen, and the other reuerenced as a mortall god vpon earth? Did not he make Coos, the place vvhere he vvas borne, of an inglorious Iland, a famous contrie, onely by the acceſſe of other nations, vvho vvere brought thither by the report of his vvonderfull skill in Phiſicke? vvhat familiaritie had he vvith kinges? vvhat eſtimation among the Philoſophers of that time as Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites and other? and to conclude, hovv vvas his fame ſpread vniuerſally throughout all Greece? I vvill not tarie vpon the recitall of the famous Phyſitions, vvho haue ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued before vs in ſeuerall ages, as Dioſcorides, Galen, Paulus AEtius, AEgineta and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. For it vvill eaſily appeare of vvhat credit this noble ſcience of phiſicke vvas in times paſt, if you conſider the inſolencitie and pride of auncient Phyſitions, vvher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of many of them diſdained the fellovvshippe of kinges, and ſome of them emboldned onely by the credit of their ſcience purchaſed amongeſt men, grevv to ſuch impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, that they vvould haue ceremonies and rightes performed vnto them as vnto godes. One ſuch vvas Themiſon Ciprius the daintie of Antiochus, another vvas Theſſalus
<pb facs="tcp:13038:5"/>
vvhom Galen maketh menſion of, vvho vvent about to innouate and chaunge the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thode of phyſicke ſet dovvne by Hippocrates and others. But the moſt famous of all vvas Menecrates the Syracuſan, vvho foolishly vſurped the name of Iupiter, oftentimes boaſting, that by his arte he coulde breath life into mortall men after the manner of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter, vvhich arrogant title the people neuer vvent about to derogate from him, but rather ſuppoſed that it vvas deſerued on his parte, becauſe he cured many of the falling euill, vvhich diſeaſe eſpecially raigned in his time. This Menecrates in a certaine epiſtle vvhich he vvrot to Phillip the king of Macedon vſeth theſe vvords: Thou art king of Macedon, and I of Phyſicke it lyeth in thy povver at thy pleaſure, to deſtroy men vvhich enioy their health, and in mine to preſerue ſickemen, and reſtore dead men to life, and to keepe the health of men vnſpotted euen vnto their olde age, if they vvill o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey me. Vnreaſonable ſurely and monſtruous vvas the pride of this man, and it vvas ſo fed vvith the applauſe and approbation of his citizens vvho vvondred at his rare cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that he marched in the citie vvith a trayne of gods after him: one in the habite of Hercules, another in the shape of Mercurie, another tooke vpon him the form of Apollo, &amp; he himſelfe ſupereminent in the midſt reſembling Iupiter, vvore a purple robe, and a crovvne of gold vpon his head, &amp; held in his hand a mightie ſcepter. The opinion of this ſcience did ſo poſſeſſe the mindes of the people in thoſe dayes, that they imagined the profeſſour of the ſame to be ſent immediatlie from heauen, for the commoditie of the vvhole countrie, and for the preſeruation of mankinde: vvhich made them not to doubt to doe vnto them all ſuperſtitious reuerence that might be, vvhereof grevv this exceſsiue pride, vvhich hath areſted as it vvere the mindes of many Phyſitions. I vvould not vvish that the Phyſitions of our time shoulde dravv this vnto an example, but rather vvith all lovvlynes to viſit euen the pooreſt, vvhen their helpe is required: for ſeeing that the life of the moſt miſerable vaſſall is as deare in the ſight of God, as the life of the moſt renoumed Monarch, shall not the Phyſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> looke to haue a shrevvd check at Gods hand, if either he hath proudly denied his help to the poore, or negligently viſited them? I vvill not diſcend into this common place, though (to ſpeake the truth) the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancie of many of our Phyſitions might giue me ſufficient occaſion, vvishing them to leaue of to imitate the ſvvelling inſolencie of Mencerates, and the reſt, and to tracke, rather in the ſtepes of Hippocrates and Galen, of vvhom it is thus vvritten, that they neuer diſdayned to shroude them ſelues vnder the ſimpleſt roofe in their countrie, to doe the pooreſt man good. And as they themſelues ſaide (beſides the glorie that they purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by their curteous benignitie) they added alvvayes to their cunning, and by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience confirmed their arte and knovvledge, vvhich might vvell ſtagger, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the infinite varietie of diſeaſes, and the ſtraunge diuerſities of mens diſpoſitions. And truely if nothing elſe, yet the enriching of their knovvledge vvhich is gathered eſpecially by long experience, might be cauſe good enough to attract and dravv them to laie holde of anye occaſion to goe to the diſeaſed perſon. And in mine opinion, the neglecting of this, vvhich proceedeth either from couetouſnes or pride, hath bene the onely cauſe, that euen from the beginning, there haue bene reckened ſo fevv good Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians: For (exempt onely Hippocrates, Galen, Auricen, AEginet<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

VVhich although ſome men vvill aſcribe to the laborious difficultie and confuſed vaſtenes of this arte eſpecially: yet I dare boldly affirme, that there hath not bene nor is, any ſuch blocke or ſtay, vvhich hath impeached ſo much their

And truely I cannot more fitly compare our am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piriques and practiſioners, then to him that pupoſeth to be a ſeaman &amp; trauailer, vvho though he ſtudiouſlie ſtriueth to attaine to the perfection of his arte, though he carefully buſieth about the coſmographicall mappes, though he induſtruouſly peruſeth the bookes of nauigation, naie (that vvhich is more) though he diligently conferreth vvith verie expert ſaylers: yet vvhen he hath forſaken the quiet hauen, and launched out into the rough ſeas, and hath taken vpon him the gouernment of the ship, vvhen he shall behold ſo manie horrible mountaines of vvater, the roaring of ſo many huge vvaues, and the outraging ſurges of the diſquieted monſtre, he vvill then confeſſe that he onely dreamed before, vvhen he imagined of the courſe of the ſeas, that his bookes vvere lame ſchole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maiſters, that the tales of his companions vvere a great deale leſſe then the things the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Since therefore the caſe ſo ſtandeth that art is vveake vvithout practiſe, and that (as Galen ſaith) experience is gotten longo rerum vſu: let the Phiſition (if he doth not prefer ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fame and vile lucre before true and abſolute knovvledge) let him (I ſaie) that his minde may be enriched, not leaue the pooreſt houſe vnfrequented. But to ſaie the truth, there is nothing derogateth ſo much from the excelling in their ſcience, as doth the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of perfection, vvhich is eſpecially gotten by the iudgement of the multitude, the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe determiner of thinges.

<pb facs="tcp:13038:6"/>
(good Reader) that I before diſcourſed of the glorie of this ſcience, and hovv it hath bene accounted of in times paſt: the dignitie vvherof, though it be ſomthing leſſened &amp; empayred (vvhich vvhether it hath happened by the ignoraunce of our Phyſitians, or by the ſiniſter opinion of the vvorld I vvill not novv diſcuſſe) yet if vve vvill vprightly vvaigh vvith our ſelues, vve may perceiue that the iudgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of men hath not any vvhit detracted from the true dignitie of the thing it ſelfe. For truly vvhat can be more noble the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to preſerue the body of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in a good eſtate, vvhich of the philoſophers is termed a litle vvorld, in reſpect of the varietie of his ſeuerall functions? vvhat can be more excellent then to be able to maintaine &amp; kepe in order that beſt vvorkmanship of God, &amp; (that vvhich is more) to correct, reforme &amp; ame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d it, &amp; as it vvere a cu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning Pylot to gouerne &amp; rule it as a litle veſſell caſt out into the great ocean, ſubiect (I do not knovv) to hovv many rockes &amp; dangers, if it be not vprightly vveilded? And ſeeing there is nothing giuen vnto vs of God, more acceptable then the health of the bodie, hovve honorablie muſt vve thinke of the meanes, by vvhich it is continued and reſtored if it be loſt? Pir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus the king of Epir did ſacrifice vnto no other god or goddeſſe, but onely vnto health, to vvhom he erected a famous temple in his ovvne countrie, calling it Templum ſani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis. He contemned or at the leaſt neglected all oracles vvhich other princes buſilie ſought after, as predictions of the euentes and ſucceſſes of the battailes vvhich they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted, or any other the like enterpriſe. He craued nothing at the handes of the gods, but onely the fruition of his health, thinking that induſtrie &amp; diligence, meeting vvith the health of the bodie, vvere able to atchiue anie thing, vvere it beſet vith neuer ſo many daungers. And in mine opinion (as the Hiſtorian verie grauelie diſcourſeth) men do folishlie erre, vvhen they complaine of nature, for lymiting the age of man vvithin the compaſſe of ſo fevv yeares, as three or foure ſcore: vvhenas truely, if the matter vvere vvell expended, vve vvould confeſſe, Induſtriam potius quam tempus deeſſe (as he ſaith) and that there is no arte or ſcience, be it neuer ſo difficult, but might be perfectlie knovven vvithin that short precinct, if the greater parte of our life did not paſſe and vanish avvaie in darkneſſe (ſlouth and ignoraunce drovvning and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvhelming in vs all light of nature) or if the courſe thereof vvere not interrupted and cut of by vntimely death, vvhich is haſtened on our partes by our inordinate and heede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe lyuing. The youg man flourishing as it vvere in the Aprill of his age, cockereth in himſelfe a foolis imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his ovvn luſtineſſe, &amp; reputeth it as a diſcredit to him to ſeeme to feare the approache of any diſeaſe, leauing the prouident gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the bodie to decrepite and vvythered olde age. In the meane time he layeth the reyne vpon his affections, and expoſeth himſelfe to anie inconuenience: either he vveltreth in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or is tyred vvith immoderate exerciſe, or (that vvhich is incident ſpeciallie to that part of our age) he admitteth vnſeaſonable vvatchinges, ſurfetting bankets, &amp; the vnſatiate execution of the follies of Venus, thinking in deede that there is nothing leſſe agreeing vnto youth and adoleſcencie, then to be pliant and obedient to anie commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and holſome method of life: yea many of them are of this minde, that the time of their youth is infamouſly ouerſlipped, vvhen they doe not rush in their voluptuous and inordinate demeanour at vvhat time the luſtie prime of their age doe ſomevvhat ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and ſupport them: &amp; if at any time they be ouertaken vvith anie infirmitie (vvhich often happeneth) as vnvvilling to be beholding to the ſcience of Phiſicke, they leaue it to be vvorne avvay by rhe ſtrength of their bodie, vvhich in deede I confeſſe hideth many diſeaſes, and for the time taketh avvaie the ſence of them, but it neuer vtterlie extinguisheth anie: for although in the infancie of the infirmitie, in reſpect of the
<pb facs="tcp:13038:7"/>
vveakenes of it, is be eaſily depreſſed &amp; ouermaiſtred by the valure of the bodie (vvhich in youth is ſomething puiſſaunt and forcible) yet vvhen age comming one vvith his ſtealing ſteppes, or elſe reckleſſe life doth detract from the force of the one, and maketh vvay for the other to ſpreade &amp; gather povver, the diſeaſe being as it vvere the ſurui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour poſſeſſeth the vvhole bodie, and at the laſt procureth his vtter ſubuerſion. And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times it happeneth that a diſeaſe breaketh out in old age, the cauſe vhereof perhaps vvas giuen in our youth. And it fareth vvith vs, as it doth vvith them vvhich are bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vith that little ſerpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of Arabia, vvhich ſtriketh a man, but ſo ſecretly, that he neuer feeleth it, neither doth he knovv it but by the vvound vvhich shevveth it ſelfe a long time, after the foundation thereof vvas laid. The opinion that the auncient Phyſitions had of the effect of ſnovv vvater is of force to perſvvade this, vvho haue vvritte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that if ſnovv reſolued into vvater be dronke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a yong childe, it vvill as it vvere maintaine vvarre againſt naturall heat, and that vvith ſuch continuance, as it vvill not shevve his effect, vntill he hath attained vnto extreame old age. I doe not altogeather beleeue this, although the great colde vvhich is naturally in that vvater, may lead me to think, that it is of a mightie operation. But there is nothing more certaine then this, that many men, repoſing to much truſt in the ſtrength of their bodies, &amp; ſo being careleſſe in gaine-ſtanding and reſiſting the beginninges of many maladies (vvhich their diſſolute order of life hath begotten and engendred) haue ben yoked by old age before the courſe of their yeares did require it, and haue brought it ſo to paſſe that their bodies haue bene nothing elſe, but ſtorehouſes and manſions of diſeaſes. VVhich kinde of men I may vvell compare to an euill &amp; neglige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t tenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, vvho being ſetled in a faire dvvelling houſe by his Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord, ſuffereth it to ruinate and in the end to fall vpon his ovvnt head for vvant of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>payring: ſo they, vvhen God hath beſtovved their bodies vpon them as gorgeous pallaces or manſion houſes, vvherein the minde may dvvell vvith pleaſure and delight, do firſt by their euill demeanour shake, and diſcraſe them, and then being altogeather careles of repairing them, do ſuffer them to run to deſtruction, or elſe vvhile they go about to late to vnderprop them declining to ruine, (as he that is lodged in an old cabbin feareth, leaſt vvith euerie puffe of vvind it shoulbe ouerturned) ſo they quake at the leaſt alteration of their bodie, and at euerie little paine, doe expect a finall diſſolution: then vvill they confeſſe vnto you, that vvhile they ryoted vnaduiſedlie in their youth they did but build matter for repentaunce in age. And vvhat do they elſe but by their examples giue vs to learne, that as the interception and praeſciſion of diſeaſes is very auaileable, vvhich ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth a man throughout his race vvith pleaſure and delight, ſo that nothing commeth more neere vnto the goodnes thereof, then (if by chaunce vvhen vve be plunged into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſeaſe) carefully to prouide that the beginning therof may be impeached: the vvhich that thou maieſt the better do, I haue (good Reader) for thy benefit, collected out of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie authours, as it vvere a breuiarie or abridgement of phiſicke, and togeather vvith thoſe diductions, I haue interlaced experimentes of mine ovvne, vvhich by long vſe and practiſe I haue obſerued to be true. Throughout the vvhole booke I haue bene more curious in preſcribing the ſundrie curations and vvaies to helpe the diſeaſes, then in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planing the nature of them, my reaſon vvas, becauſe if my bookes should come to the handes of the vnlearned a little vvould ſuffice (the former being more neceſſarie.) Againe I knevv, that the learned vvould not be contented or ſatisfied vvith it, though it had bene neuer ſo great: and yet I haue not omitted anie neceſſarie ſigne, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe may appeare eaſily to any capable braine. I shall ſeeme boldly to haue aduentured the edition of this labour, ſeeing that I shall run into the babble of our countrie phiſitians,
<pb facs="tcp:13038:7"/>
vvho thinke their art to be diſcredited, vvhen it is published in ſo baſe a tongue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and againe, are loath to haue the ſecretes of their ſcience reuealed to euerie man. In deede I knovv that vnder ſome colour they may obiect ſomevvhat, but yet they may vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, that I haue follovved the example of many learned Phiſitians both of our Englishmen &amp; other countrie men alſo, vvho published their practiſes in their mother tongue, &amp; in other countries eſpecially it is ſo rife &amp; commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that in Italie &amp; Frau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce you shall not find any learned Phiſitian, that hath not vvritten as much, (nay rather more) in his ovvne countrie language, then in Latine: yea vve haue many bookes in phiſick, that haue firſt bene ſet out in French and Italian, and aftervvard for the commoditie of other nations, haue bene tranſlated into latine, and ſo made generall, vvhich before the vvriter had as it vvere bequeathed to his countrimen. And no doubt they vvere all touched vvith an eſpeciall care to profit their ovvne countre, being vvilling that all men (as in deede it concerneth all) should reape the commodities of their labours. For I cannot ſee hovv that ſaying of Quintilian can be verified in this one arte (vvhich is this) that then all artes should be truely happie, vvhen the profeſſours of the ſame should only iudge of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but I haue alvvaies bene of this minde, that it behoueth euerie man to be cunning in his ovvn conſtitution, &amp; to knovv ſo much as may ſerue to foreſtall the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming of many or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie diſeaſes, vvhich commonly light vpon the ignoraunt: yea &amp; ſometime to be able to chaſe avvay a maladie vvhen it hath alreadie caught hold of the bodie: my reaſon is, both becauſe euerie man may iudge beſt of his ovvne bodie, and perceiue the declininges and alterations of the ſame, And againe vve knovv, hovv many haue died, and do die continuallie for vvant of helpe, (the Phiſitian being not alvvaies at their elbovve) vvhereas in the beginning of their ſickneſſe, a litle knovvledge might haue ſtopped the paſſage of the infirmitie. In the old time vvhen phiſicke vvas brought vnder no forme, but conſiſted onely of a fevv experimentes vvhich paſſed from hand to hand, yong chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren together vvith other artes did receiue certaine preceptes and rules, hovv to order and gouerne the bodie, and learned alſo preſeruatiues againſt poiſons, and the receipt of ſalues to cure any greene vvound, and the meanes to helpe certaine ordinarie diſeaſes, vvhich (in deede) vvere but fevv (the age of man being the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> far more ſtrong.) VVe read hovv Linus, vvho vvas ſcholemaiſter to Hercules vvhen he had inſtructed him in the arte of vvreſtling, (vvhich then vvas honoured eſpecially) and in Muſicke, that he gaue him the receipt of a certaine balme, vvhich he often vſed in many of his aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And vvhat vvas it, that gaue matter to the fable of Achilles, hovv his mother Thetis had made his bodie impenetrable, but that knovvledge of his vvhich he had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of his maister Chyron the centaure, vvho taught him the vertue of an herbe, vvhich to this daie bereth his name, by vvhich he healed all his vvounds he receiued in battaile? VVhat an honorable menſion doth Homer make of Machao and Podalirius the ſonnes of Aeſculapius, in that they could cure themſeues, vvhen they vvere at anie time hurt of the enemie? This cunning alſo had Mithridates, and Fabricius the Romaine he that vanquished Pirrhus, and alſo Marcus Curius and many other vvho are recorded by Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories, vvhoſe names I vvould remember, if I did not ſee the enlarging of this common place by examples to be altogether vnneceſſarie, vvhen there is no man vvhich ſo farre ſvvarueth from common ſenſe, that vvill not confeſſe it to be verie expedient &amp; neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for all to knovv the eſtate of their ovvne bodies. I vvill therfore foreſake the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of ſo manifeſt a thing, and returne vnto thee (good Reader) vvhom I haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die offended in exceeding the iuſt length of a Preface, like vnto that vvaiefaring man, vvho vvhen he had purpoſed to vndertake a long iourney, ſtumbled euen in the verie

threſshold of his doore. But if it be an offence, I did voluntarilie run into it, chooſing rather to be carped at of the Rethorician for vſing too many vvordes, then to be vvor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thely reprehended of the readers for being to ſparing in vttering the reaſons, vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I vvas firſt adduced to publish this my labour.

A man may eaſely diſcourſe of this, but the fantaſies of man are to variant to preuaile a vvhit in diſſuading them. For mine ovvne parte (that I may novv ende) I haue not ſought or hunted after any vaine glorie by the edition of this my labour, but onely I haue endeuoured by this meanes (being vnable any vvaie elſe) to do ſome good to my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, vvhich deſire of mine shall ſufficiently comfort me, though I vvant the outvvard approbation of the vvorld. And yet this one thing I vvoulde craue at the handes of the learned, that If by chaunce my bookes come vnder their cenſure, they vvill either giue them their good vvord, or elſe ſuffer themſelues to be iudged of by perfourming the like labour. And as Martiall pretilie ſung.

though in deede this ſupplication of mine may rather more fitly be preferred vnto the vnlearned, vvho thinke they haue gotten a goodly meanes to purchaſe their ovvne credit, vvhen they can vnder ſome colour maligne the doings of any man, as though o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers vvell doinges vvere as impeachmentes to their eſtimations, or the errours of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men the ſubiect and matter of their praiſes.

great aboundance of humours, ſometime through humoures, that ſtoppe the paſſage of the vapoures and moiſture in the head: ſometime through windines engendred in ſome parte of the head, being weake.

Yf paine of the head doth come through aboundance of humours, contained in one parte of the head, or in two, or in all partes, the paine is more vehement, that commeth of hote humours, or of colde, that which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of drie thinges is more moderate, yf ther be not manifeſt heat or colde ioyned with them, as for moyſt thinges touching ther qualitie, doe cauſe noe paine at all, but with ther qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tity they maie fill the paſſages and ſoe cauſe paine. If aboundance of all foure humours equaly, or of bloud alone doe cauſe headache without obſtruction and ſtopping of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages, it maketh the head heauie and full, as it were ſtretched out and ſwolne, but if the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of humours be with obſtruction, it cauſeth moderate paine if the obſtruction be but little, but if the obſtruction be great, ther ſhall be very great paine. Alſo if the multitude of humours haue a ſharpe and byting qualitie, according to that qualitie the paine will be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cking and ſhooting, if with the heauines or ſtretching of the head therbe beating, and as it were a pulſe, it betokeneth inflammacion in the head.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT which the Latines call Vertigo, is a diſeaſe, wherin the patient doth imagine that his head is turned rou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d about. Ther is another diſeaſe ſomewhat like vnto this, which in Latin is called, <hi>Tenebricoſa Vertigo,</hi> and that is when the patient doth thinck that al that he ſeeth turneth about, and ſodenlie with it, his ſight faileth him, he ſuppoſing that he is compaſſed about with miſt and darknes. It is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly of the Phiſitions called <hi>Scotomia. Fuſchius</hi> doth thinck that they erre greatlie, that make a difference betweene the former kinds, but it maie be confirmed out of good Authors, Hippocrates, Galen &amp; others. Both the aforſaid kinds be inge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred after one ſort, and that is through the inordinate mouing of windy vapours and ſpirits, contained in certain partes of the braine.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cauſae.</hi>
                  </note> This diſeaſe is cauſed either of the braine it ſelfe being diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pured and euill affected, or of the mouth of the ſtomake offending the braine. The braine it ſelfe is affected euill, when a groſſe and tough humour is contained in it, from whence a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porous and windy ſpirite being reſolued by weake heat, is moued inordinately about in the braine. The mouth of the ſtomake doth affect the braine, when through corrupte hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours being gathered aboundantly in it, vapours and windy exhalations are carried vp to the braine, &amp; ſo turne about the animall ſpirits contained in it.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Signa.</hi>
                  </note> Thoſe that are troubled with this diſeaſe, a darknes and miſte appeareth before ther eyes vpon euery light occaſion, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if they turn about. For it chaunceth to them by turning once about, as is doth to other when they turne often, and therfore the patient many times falls downe. Alſo it doth aſtony him, if he ſee another man, or a wheele, or any ſuch like thing turne about, as alſo it he ſee whirle pooles in the water turne about, for the viſuall ſpirites beholding a wheel that tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth about, or any ſuch like thing, doth alſo turne about in like ſorte, and ſo the mouing of the humour and the ſpirittes are troubled vnequall and inordinate. When this diſeaſe doth procead of the braine being euill affected, then ther proceadeth ſound of the eares, veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t paine in the head, and heauines therin. Alſo the ſmelling and the other ſenſes proceading from the head are hurte. Ther fitte is then chiefly when the Sunne doth heat them, or when ther head is hotte by ſome other meanes, &amp; ſo the humours being diſſolued, do turne about in the braine. When the diſeaſe proceadeth from the mouth of the ſtomake, then they feele before it, a gnawing in the ſtomake, as it were the hart burne, &amp; a diſpoſition to vomit. This diſeaſe maie be diſcerned from the falling ſicknes, for that this doth nether take awaie the ſenſes from the patient, nor it cauſeth not the crampe and writhing of members in the fitte.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Prognoſtica.</hi>
                  </note> This diſeaſe is not to be lightly eſteemed, for the <hi>Vertigo</hi> (as Galen ſaith) is nigh to the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſicknes, and the <hi>Apoplexie.</hi> And therfore it wold be well looked to. For the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ertigo</hi> and <hi>ſcotoma</hi> will quickly be changed into pernitious diſeaſes, for that they are verie nigh to them, ſpecially to the falling ſicknes and the <hi>Apoplexie.</hi> And if thoſe things that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient doth imagyne to ſee before his eyes, appeare bloudye and reddiſhe, he is apt to fall into madnes, but thoſe that ſeeme to ſee purple colours, are diſpoſed to the falling ſicknes. The <hi>Scotoma</hi> or darke vertigo becommeth moſt vehement in winter, or in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſpring. Beſydes in manie it is a ſigne that the falling ſicknes will followe. And many do vſe to call it a litle Epilepſie. As concerning diet:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Victus ratio.</hi>
                  </note> let the patient remaine in an ayer, that is temperate, pure, bright, and cleare, and let him eſchewe groſſe and cloudie ayer. Let him eſchew windes, eſpecially ſouth windes, let him alſo auoid the beames of the ſunne &amp; the moon: as alſo let him not behold things that moue ſwiftly, as ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning waters, or things
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:13038:17"/>
that turne about, as wheels, &amp; ſuch like, or to looke into deep pittes is euill for him. Let him eate meates of good iuyce, &amp; of eaſy digeſtion, &amp; ſuch as engendre no windines, as partrich, capon, pheſant, chicken, veale, ſcaly fiſhes and ſuche like, that be eaſie of digeſtion. And let him vſe to eate but moderately of them, for ſatiety, as alſo long faſting is not good for him. He muſt eſchewe all things that cauſe vapours to aſcend into the head as oynions, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, leekes &amp; ſuch like. And therfor if he drinke wyne, let it not be very olde, ſmall whit wine may be permitted him. After meate it is good for him to eat ſome reſtrictiue thing to ſtoppe the vapours that they aſcend not to the head, &amp; that ſpecially if the ſtomake be cauſe of this diſeaſe. Let his excercyſe be moderate, let him eſchewe ſleepe of the day, nether let him ſleepe within two hours aftermeate. Let not the place be to hote wher he ſleepeth, nor let him not kepe his head to hote. In his excercyſes let him not ſtirre his head muche. And therefor it is good for him to vſe frictions often, eſpeciallie in the morning before he ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, beginne at the vpper partes, &amp; end with the nether. He muſt refrain from perturbations and affections of the mind, ſpecially from anger, feare, and ſadnes, as alſo from loud crying, and ſinging. Carnall copulation is not good for him.

Therfor you muſt drawe away the bloud at ſundrie tymes vntill you haue ſufficient. But if any thing doe hinder you from bloud letting, firſt you muſt purge him with a ſharpe cliſter, whereof you ſhall haue example afterward in the Chapter of <hi>Apoplexye.</hi> Afterward miniſter a purgation according as the humour abounding doth require. But forget not firſt to vſe a preparatiue,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Localia.</hi>
                  </note> when the whole body is ſufficiently purged, you muſt vſe locall things to the head, &amp; firſt apply cupping glaſſes to the hinder parte of the head with ſcatification. Afterward vſe to miniſter gargariſmes, &amp; ſternutations to draw rewme from the head. Poure into the noſe iuyce of chickweed, betes or cyclaminus. Alſo nitrum beaten with nigella and mixed with old oyle, purgeth well by the noſethrills. Alſo odours made of the decoction of maiorame, hyſope, &amp; floures of ſtaechados, a litle <hi>caſtoreum,</hi> muſke, and vinegre being added is good. After that let the patient enter into a bath, ſpecially a naturall bath that is of alome, &amp; if his head be ouer hote in the bathe, you muſt coole it often with oyle of roſes &amp; vinegre applyed in clothes to it ſpecially on the fore parte of the head, and about the forehead and the tempels. And if the diſeaſe doe ceaſe by theſe remedies, then vſe noe other. But if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinew ſtill, you muſt cut the arteryes that be nigh the temples aboue the eares, ſpecially if the diſeaſe come of hote vapours aſce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding to the braine by the arteries. And this is not only the praecept of Galen, but alſo of <hi>Aetius,</hi> &amp; <hi>Paulus Aegineta.</hi> How the arteries ſhould be cut you ſhall lerne of the ſaid <hi>AEgineta</hi> in his. 6. booke &amp; 4.

And therfor if the diſeaſe be cauſed by any of theſe meanes before reherſed, the patient ſhall feele ſmall eaſe or none by cutting of the arteries. And therfor be dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to enquire of the aforſaid cauſes, before you cut the arteries.<note place="margin">

And for that ſome be troubled with the light, and ſome with darknes, it is beſt to trie them in both, and to lay him in the light, which is afraid of darkneſſe, and contrary he that is offended at the light, let him be in a dark place.

Let his drinke be water, wherin a litle Cynamon or barley hath bene boiled, you may commixe with it ſyrupe of violettes, or of roſes, or of water lillies. But beware you giue them not much at once, nor oftentimes, but ſeldomee, and a litle at once. When ſignes of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Moreouer let the ſicke be kept quiet without mouing as much as is poſſible, if he be riche let ſeruauntes hold him, if poore, bind him, for inordinate mouing deminiſheth ſtrength. Alſo a bath of ſweete water is good for him, if the body be drye and rimpled, but he muſte vſe it bloud warme.

Therfore the Phiſition muſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently diſcerne the cauſes. The cauſes of this diſeaſe be either externall or internall, if they be internall, either aboundance of fleume, or melancholie is cauſe of it. If ther be no ſignes of thoſe humours abounding, then muſt it needes come of ſome externall cauſe, eſpeciallie if it come not through extreme old age. The externall cauſes you maie lerne by relation of the ſicke, and thoſe that are about him, as if anie diſeaſe be newly paſſed, and ſo turned into obliuion, or if medicines were miniſtred inwardlie, or applyed outwardly to the head which haue vertue to coole extremelie.

If cold be ioyned with moiſture, it engendreth the lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and Carus wherof we will entreate in the next Chapter. Therfore in them that haue loſt ther memorie you muſt obſerue ther ſleepes, whither they be ouer ſleepy, or in a meane, or ſleepe not at all, for ſo ſhall you finde what diſtempure doth moſt abound. Beſides you muſt marke whither they auoid any thing at the noſe, or whither any thing diſtill from the head by ther mouth, or whither thoſe partes be altogether drie. For by them you maie likewyſe coniecture the diſtempure abounding. And if fleume be cauſe of the euill, you ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceue it not only by immoderate ſleepe, and aboundaunce of excrementes diſcending from the braine (as is afore ſaid) but alſo by the diſpoſition of the ſicke, by his age, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, by the time of the yere, the region, the ſtate of the ayer, and by the diet that he vſed before.

But note, if the diſeaſe be cauſed of a cold &amp; moiſt diſtempur, then the whole order of his diet muſt be hote and drie.

For the bodie being corroborate, &amp; ſtrength renewed, the memorie will come again. If you require to know what things are requiſite for ſuch a diet, you ſhall find it in the Chapter of the feuer hectike. If the memorie be loſt by extreme age, then phiſick will nothing auaill. But only they muſt content them ſelfes with diet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenient, but if the memory fail ſodainlie, the other members of the body being ſafe, then the falling ſicknes is to be feared, or the palſey, or the <hi>Apoplexy.</hi> And therfor in ſuch a caſe you muſt prouide diligently by al meanes that no ſuch thing chaunce as is to be feared.

The whole ſcope of curing the diſeaſe, if it come only of a cold diſtempure of the braine conſiſteth in heating.

                  </note> The cure is of two ſortes, according to the diuerſity of the euills. For in the ſoporiferous and ſleepy <hi>Coma,</hi> you muſt vſe thoſe remedies that are praeſcribed in the Chapters of <hi>Carus,</hi> and the Lethargie, and to ſpeak briefly after the whole body be purged, if the euill be cauſed of moiſtnes, then you muſt applye ſuch things as will drye the braine made with ſharpe vineger and roſes, and cammomill commixed, and you may alſo let the fume therof go vp into the noſethrills. If it be cauſed of cold, then apply oyle of dill, and cammomill warmed, and if the cold be great, you maie ſomtime boile in oyle, peniroyall &amp; dill and vſe it. But if the euill be cauſed of cold and moiſture ioyned together: then muſt it be cured, as the Lethargy. If it com of weaknes and lack of ſtrength, then you muſt vſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoratiues to recouer it againe. Suppoſitaries are very good to be vſed in theſe kindes of diſeaſes, for that they ſtirre and prouoke nature. For the watching <hi>Coma,</hi> ſince it conſiſteth of mixed and contrary cauſes, it muſt be cured by contrary medicines partly as the freneſie, and partly as the lethargie. And to know which of them you muſt vſe moſt, you may lerne that by the humour moſt abounding. For if fleume abound mor then choler, then you muſt vſe moſt the remedies againſt the lethargy: but if contrariewyſe choler do moſt abound, then muſt your remedies be for the moſt parte ſuche as are good againſt the freneſy.

But when ther is a litle impedime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in the breathing, then you may iudge that ther is but litle hurte in the braine, and ſo you maie account it a ſmall and weak Apoplexy. The worſt and ſtrongeſt Apoplexie is, wherin the breathing is ſo deminiſhed that it can very hardly be perceiued, and that is almoſt as euill, wherin the breath ſtoppeth for a whyle, and then is fetched with great violence.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">P</seg>ARALYSIS in Greeke, <hi>Reſolutio</hi> in Latin: in Engliſhe the Palſeye. It is a diſeaſe wherin the one halfe of the body either the right or the left doth looſe both ſenſe and mouing. Alſo ſomtime the palſey chaunceth in one member only, (as for example) in the hand, the legge, or the tongue. But note here that the palſey which followeth the Apoplexy is particularly called in greeke <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. And therfore the word <hi>Paralyſis</hi> is a more generall name then <hi>Paraplegia.</hi> But wheras in the palſey, ſomtime ſenſe only is loſt, and ſometime mouing alone, and ſomtime both ſenſe and mouing: it is eſpecially called reſolution of the ſenewes or palſeye, when mouing is loſt. Why ſomtime feeling is loſt only, &amp; ſomtime mouing alone, &amp; ſomtime both together, Galen declareth at large in his firſt Booke <hi>de ſymptomatum cauſis,</hi> Cap. 4. &amp; ther for it need not be here reherſed, notwithſtanding it ſhall not be amiſſe to aunſwere briefly to that queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>VVhy in the palſey ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſenſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, ſometime mouing alone, and ſometime both together periſhe.</hi>
                  </note> Firſt note that aſwell the faculty of mouing as of ſenſe floweth from the braine, as from a fountaine, and is deryued from thence by &amp; in the ſenewes to the inſtruments of motion and ſenſe, and therfor it muſt needes be, if that faculty of the braine be hindred or ſtopped by any cauſe, that it cannot diſcend to the inſtruments of mouing or of ſenſe: that they ſhould looſe mouing or ſenſe according as the ſenewes be affected. And therfor in thoſe members that participate two kindes of ſenewes, as the eyes and the tongue doe, the former queſtion is eaſy to be ſoluted, for that they haue one kind of ſenewes for motion, &amp; another kind for ſenſe, and ſo the one may be hurte, and the other ſafe, or they may be both hurt, and ſo both ſenſe and motion periſhe. But in members, that haue but one kind of ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newe, the queſtion is more obſcure to aunſwere. In ſuch members therfore, if (the ſkinne being take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> away) the muſcle lying naked cannot moue at all, and yet feeling remaineth in it, you may know that the hurt is not great. But if the ſenowes be much ſtopped, then hath it
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:13038:22"/>
loſt both ſenſe and mouing, for it is vnpoſſible that the ſenſe of a muſcle ſhould be loſt, and the motion remaine ſtill. The reaſon is for that leſſe of the animal facultie is requiſite for feeling, then for mouing, ſo that ther may come ſufficient quantitie of that facultie to a muſcle to cauſe feeling in it, and yet not enough to cauſe it to moue alſo, and therfor a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked muſcle, which hath his facultie both of feeling and mouing, of one kind of ſenowe, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not moue and lacke ſenſe. But ether it hath ſenſe, and lacketh mouing, and then his hurt is but litle, or it hath loſt both, and that is when the hurt is great, and the ſenowe is altogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtopped. But where there is a member that hath ſenowes placed in the muſcles to cauſe mouing, and other ſenowes ſpread in the ſkinne to cauſe feeling (for the ſenowes that are diſperſed in the muſcles do not ſend out branches to the ſkinne as ſome ſuppoſe) I ſay it may come to paſſe in that member, that ſometime it may loſe feeling alone, and ſometime mouing alone, and ſometime both togither. For it may be that the ſkin which couereth the muſcle may looſe his ſenſe of feeling, the ſenowe being affected which is diſperſed in it, and yet the ſenowe that runneth in the muſcle may be ſafe, and therfore the muſcle may moue. But if the ſenowe which is ſpred in the muſcle be affected, and the ſenowe that commeth to the ſkinne remaine ſafe, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber cannot moue, and yet it hath ſenſe and feeling left, and that commeth to paſſe, becauſe the ſenowe of the one is hurt, and the other hath his ſenowe ſafe: although they ſpring both fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one place, yet they are deuided in the way as they come to the member. And if both the ſenowes be affected as well that, that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the muſcle, as that which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to the ſkinne, then both ſenſe of feeling and mouing alſo periſh and ar loſt, and that is whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine from whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce they do both ſpring, is affected and hurt. You may diſcerne that, when you know exactly the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon originall &amp; ſpring of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ſenowe, in conſidering diligently whether the braine it ſelfe be affected, or the backbone at the head of it, or in any of his ſpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dils beſides.

                     <hi>Four kindes of Cataractes curable.</hi>
                  </note> Of theſe maner of Cataractes be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen diuers ſpices or kyndes, wherof four be curable, and three be vncurable. The firſt kind of the curable Cataract, is light, right, bright, like white chalke, or as Alabaſter well poliſhed, and it is cauſed by a ſtroke in the eye either with a ſticke or a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſtone, or any other outward violence. The ſecond kynd is ſomewhat white, and much like <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to a Caeleſtiall colour, and this procedeth from the ſtomache, and is commonly cauſed of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holſome meates, and vnkind nouriſhment, wherof a groſſe fumoſitie reſolueth, and aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vp into the brain, and from thence falleth downe into the eyes. The third kind is alſo whitiſh, but it turneth into the colour of aſhes, and is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly engendred of paine in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> head, as of the Mygrime, or ſuch like diſeaſes, and it is cauſed ſometime of great ſorrow and great heauines, whereof commeth immoderate weeping, and ſometime of much cold and much watching, &amp; ſuch other like. The fourth ſpice is of a Cytrine colour, and is commonly engenderd of exceſſiue meat and drincke indigeſt, and alſo of great labour, and ſometime <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> of the humour Melancholicke. Theſe are the four curable kindes, but they be neuer healed till they be growen and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firmed, and the ſigne or token of their full perfection is, when the patient ſeeth right nought, vnleſſe it be the brightnes of the Sunne by day light, or the light of the Moone by night. Many ignorant perſons, nether knowing the cauſe, nor the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of theſe maner of cataractes, haue aſſayed to cure them with purgations, powders, and plaiſters, but they haue bene deceiued: for nether inward medicines, nor outward reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies can any whit preuaile, vnleſſe you ioyne to them <hi>Artem acuariam,</hi> the Art of the Nedle:
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13038:29"/>
which, becauſe it is vnknowen to many of our practicioners, I will inſert a diſcourſe of it in this treatiſe. Neuertheleſſe, before you vſe the nedle, it is requiſite that the braine ſhould be purged with <hi>pilulae leroſolymi ana,</hi> which you ſhal make thus. ℞. Turbith. ℥.j. Aloes hepaticke. <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>.ſs. maces, quibibes, maſticke, and ſaffron. ana. <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>.j. and beat them to pouder altogether, and confect them with the iuyce of Roſes, and make pilles thereof: and this purgation muſt be miniſtred the daye before you trye with the needle. And on the next daye, while the diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed party is faſting, about nyne of the clocke, cauſe him to ſitte ouerthwarte a ſtoole in ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding faſhion, and plante your ſelfe lykewiſe on the ſame ſtoole face to face againſt him, and bidde him, hold his ſound eye cloſle ſhutte. Encourage him alſo, and exhort him to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, for the tractabilitie of him maketh much to the conuenient diſpatche of your labour. Then with your left hand lifte vp the ouer eyelidde, and with your other hand putte in the needle made therfore, on the ſide furtheſt from the noſe: and ſubtillie thirle the tunicle ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatrice, writhing alwayes your fingers too and froe, till you touch the corrupt water (which is the cataract) with the point of the needle; and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> begin by litle and litle to remoue that water from before the ſight to the corner of the eye, and there keep it with the point of your needle,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cautio.</hi>
                  </note> the ſpace of three minutes of an houre, and then remoue your needle eaſilie from it. And if it happen that it riſeth vp againe, bring it backe the ſeconde time. But this caution you muſt be ſure to haue, that when the needle hath touched the cataracte; you doe not writh it about with your fingers too and froe, till it be ſet in his place before named, but that you gentlie drawe it thither: and when you haue brought it thither, thirle the needle a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, till it hath gathered the water about it, and then pull it out. (this done) Cauſe him to ſhutte his eye, and apply therto a plaiſter of flaxe and the white of an egge, and cauſe him to lye in his bedde nyne dayes together, remouing the plaiſter three times on the daye, and three times on the night without any other ſtirring of it. Prouided, that he lye in a verye darke place, and let his dyet be thinne, as rere egges and white bread. And if he be young and luſtie, let his drinke be water, but if his body be weake, let him drinck wyne well lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phate. For truly much nouriſhment would preiudice our cure by ingendring much bloud in the eye, which is verie hurtfull nowe in the beginning of the healing it. (The nynth daye being paſſed let him ryſe and waſhe his eye well with faier cold water, and he ſhall enioye his ſight by the helpe of God, euen as he did before, although ſome one of the cataractes be fayrer healed then the other, as namelye the ſeconde kynde and the fourth kynde: but that which is cauſed by a ſtrype, (thoughe the water be with more eaſe extracted) yet the eye neuer recouereth his clearnes of ſight againe, becauſe it is greatlye bruiſed and troubled by the force of the ſtroke. And the third kynde alſoe, thoughe it be ſoone reſtored to his olde perfection, yet it abydeth not long therein, vnleſſe it be continued as well by good dyet, as alſoe by this electuarie, which is called <hi>Diaolibanum ſolarimitanum,</hi> which is thus confected. ℞. of cloues. ℥.ij. nutmegges of India, &amp; ſaffron. ana. <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>.j.ſs. and of good <hi>Caſtoreum.</hi> 
                  <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>.j. Let all theſe be beaten into pouder and ſearced, and confect that pouder with clarified honye, and let the patient receiue of this electuarie in the morning faſting the quantitie of a cheſtnutte, or walnutte, and at euening to bedward as muche. And let him vſe digeſtiue nouriſhing meates, which ingender good bloud, but let him beware of beif and goates fleſh, and Eeles, and rawe onyons, for they ar oftentimes vſed to rypen the cataract, which muſt be done before you ſtriue with it. In winter, let the patient drincke hote wines, in the which let him infuſe Sage and Rewe. Let him alſoe abſteine from the companie of women, nether let him frequent common bathes, for euerie ſtrong fume hurteth him greatlie. The aforeſaid electu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie of <hi>Diaolibanum</hi> is good to drye teares. It auaileth alſoe againſt all maner of payne of the migrime which proceedeth of fleume. After this ſorte are all the curable cataractes healed, (I meane) by the needle, which muſt be made of golde, ſiluer, or of cleane Spanniſhe lattine: for Iron, or Steele are britle and frangible. And if the cataracte ſhould proue hard in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing downe, the point might eaſilie breake, which, if it ſhould abyde in the eye, it would in time conſume the eye through aboundance of teares and greatnes of paine.</p>

This kynde of cataracte is cauſed of a corruption in the mothers wombe, and therefore they that haue them, are for the moſt part borne blinde, and therefore they beſtowe their labour in vaine, that aſſay to cure them, for the Nerues opticke be oppilate and mortified, ſo that no medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines can preuaile, although many that haue this kinde, do ſee the light of the Sunne, and the ſtature of a man euen to their liues end: we call it <hi>Gutta ſerena,</hi> becauſe it is engendred of a water that falleth from the braine, of the which truly one litle droppe corrupteth and diſſolueth all the humours of the eyes, and ſtoppeth the hollow neruies and ſenowes, ſo that the viſible ſpirites may no more paſſe through them. The ſecond cataract incurable is that which appeareth in the eye of a greene colour, like water ſtanding in watery places, not much moued, nor remoued: this is the moſt daungerous kynde of all, if ther be any degrees in them, and it is procured by the ouermuch coldnes of the braine, and with great buffeting and beating about the head, with great faſting, and ſuch other like. The third vncurable Cataract is, when the pupill of the eye is dilated and ſpread ſo farre, that no circles may be ſeene within the tunicles of the eyes, and the eye ſeemeth all blacke, or els all white. And thus are the three kyndes of Cataractes vncurable diſtinguiſhed and knowen: which will forbidde the practicioners to deale with them.</p>

There be other diſeaſes alſoe of the eye engendred of bloud, as the ophthal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and pannicles; And theſe kyndes of infirmities are tyed to the ſeaſon of the year,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:13038:30"/>
for they commonly happen about the end of Auguſt, and ſo foorth to the end of September and the rather then, becauſe they proceed of the eating of the varietie of fruictes. The Oph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalmy is thus deſcribed: An Ophthalmy is a corrupt bloud ingendred of hote humours, and commonly, it ſtandeth and appeareth in the white of the eyes, and round about the tuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and blaknes of the eye, and it procedeth of immoderat ſorrow &amp; burning, and of abou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

In this kind of infirmitie it is good to vſe this powder, which many, (in reſpect of the notable vertue therof) do call <hi>Puluis benedictus,</hi> which is thus made. ℞. white ſarcocall, and beate it to verie fine pouder, and fill the patientes eye with it, and lett him ly with it wide open till the pouder be conſumed, and in the meane time make a plaiſter of flexenherdes, and waſh it well in cold water, which (when you haue dreined out in your hand) lay it on the patient his eye, which he ſhall ſtill kepe open, and it will procure him to take his reſt verie well. Many ignorant practicioners, while they haue endeuoured to cure this infirmitie with many impertinent medicines, haue added ſorrow to ſorrow, and haue brought the eye without his liddes, &amp; ſo made it vncurable, which by the aforſaid pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der might eaſilie haue bene healed.

This ointment is not only tied, to this care, but it hath many vertues: ſom of the which, I wil expreſſe, though it be impertinent to this diſcourſe. It is verie good againſt a greene wound for it both purgeth &amp; clenſeth it. It is good againſt the tooth ache or paine in the gummes, if the cheeke be annointed therwith. It is good againſt the paine in the matrice, if it be ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten like an electuarie. It is good for them alſo who are moleſted in exceſſe, if their ſtomach be annointed, and their feete together with their handes. It auaileth againſt the migrime, and generally for euerie paine of the eyes, if the patient be annointed therwith vpon the temples as before. The ſecond pannicle muſt be cured at the very beginning, for if it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate and hardened vpon the tunicle, it may not by any ſubtilitie be remoued (the tunicle ſaued) and therfore it is not ſafe to aduenture to cure it, when by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance of time, it hath vnited it ſelf with the ſaluatrice. But at the firſt you ſhall cure it thus: firſt make a cautery in the temples with a round cautery, (as ſhalbe ſhewed afterward whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I ſpeak of cauteries) For fire diſſolueth and conſumeth the pannicle, and ſo keepeth it from vniting and incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with the tunicle, and maketh the eye fitte to be clarified with this medicine following. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the eye is cauterized, put into the eye ſome of the pouder called <hi>Puluis Nabetus</hi> (which I will teach afterward) and while he lieth with this pouder in his eye, take four crabbes, and roſt them vnder the Embres very well, and then take them, and being pilled and cored, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporate them with the white of an egge in maner of an ointment, and lay it vpon a cleane flexin herde, and bind it to the eye with a linnen band, and ſo renew this plaiſter morning &amp; euening till you haue abſolued your cure.

And this pouder is made of Sugar Candy of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> which pouder is very auailable againſt many ſickneſſes of the eye. The ſecond infirmitie which happeneth to the eye by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> fleume, is when the eyes appeare troubled and full of veynes, ſo cloſed with a pannicle that the pate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>it cannot well ſee, nor diſcern any thing, &amp; this ſiknes is called <hi>pannicu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vitreu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

The third in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> cauſed by fleume is, when the eye appeareth carnous or fleſhie, the which carnoſity (if it be waxed hard by the ſpace of a yeare or two) giueth place to no medicine. But in the beginning cauteries (in that maner that I preſcribed them before) will heale it, ſo that after cauterizing you very warely cut away all the carnoſitie with a ſharp Raſour, without offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the tunicle Saluatrice, which when you haue done, fill the eye full of pouder of Candy, and then cauſe the patient to ſhutte his eye, and then lay to it a plaiſter of flaxe of the white of an egge, and chaunge the plaiſter twiſe on the day xv dayes, and after xv dayes, make this plaiſter. ℞. a handfull of <hi>Cardus benedictus,</hi> &amp; ſtampe it well, and mingle it with halfe the white of an egge, and ſo make a plaiſter with flexen herdes, &amp; lay it vpon the eye, remouing

The fourth maladie cauſed of fleume is, when the eye appeareth all bolne, and alwayes ſheadeth teares, ſo that the patient may not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his eyes by reaſon of the heauines of the eyeliddes, for there is a fatnes on the ouer eye lidde, which troubleth the eye very much, and this diſeaſe is called the ſcab of the eye, and it proceedeth from ſuperabounda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of ſalt fleume, the cure of it is this: you ſhall firſt purge the ſtomach and braine of the patient with this receipt: ℞.

In theſe diſeaſes therfore it ſeemeth to the patient, that there are flies flieng in the ayer, and that there are three or four Moones, and three or four faces, when he beholdeth but one: but theſe infirmities happen moſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly to aged perſons, which are melancholy, ſuperfluitie of melanchoy dimming their eyeſight. There muſt not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any medicine be put into the eye of the patient, but make this electuary mitigatiue and apparatiue, which will open the opilations of the nerues, which did before forcloſe the way to the viſible ſpirits.

There is another infirmitie alſo which proceedeth by the aboundance of melancholy, and that they call <hi>Vngula</hi>: for it is much like the Naile of a finger, ſometime it breedeth in the corner of the eye to the earewarde, &amp; ſo ſpreadeth ouer the eye, if it be not hindred and reſiſted betymes: ſometime alſo it happeneth that another vngle ariſeth in the other corner, and if they meete, it maketh the cure more vncertaine, yet by headfull ſkill &amp; diſcretion it may be healed by the hand: Take therfore a twiche of ſiluer, and therwith lift vp ſubtellie the vngle from the tunicle, proceeding to the lachrimall wher it grewe, and there cut it away, and then lay the white of an egge and flexe vpon it .x. dayes together, remouing it twiſe on the day, and at the end of ten dayes waſh his eye with hote water, and put into it <hi>Puluis Nabetus</hi> before named, till the eye be ſufficientlie cleared. Let him abſteine from ſuch meates as do feed melancholy. It happeneth alſo ſometime, that the ſuperfluous aboundance of melancholy, ſeated in the braine, begetteth a drynes in the eye liddes, which afterward turneth to ytching and burning. But this diſeaſe is cured by letting the patient bloud vpon the middle veyne in the forehead, and after with vſing this collirye. ℞. fourty tender croppes of the Bramble, and ſtampe them ſmall, then putte them in a newe earthen veſſell together with a quarte of good white wyne, and ſo boyle them till the halfe

be conſumed, and then clenſe it, and preſerue it in a glaſſe to your vſe, and twiſe in the daye put ſome of it into your patientes eye, till it be hole. Of the like ſuperfluitie of melancholy groweth ſomtime a corrupt humour without the eye vpon the lidde, which embolneth all the one ſide of the face with extreeme paine, but with no offence to the ſight of the eye. The ſignes of this diſeaſe are theſe: it maketh the eyeliddes hard and red, and keepeth the eye ſo ſhutte, that the patient may not open it. For the cure of it, you ſhall take fine flower of old wheate, and yolkes of egges. ana. ℥.j. of ſaffron. <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>.j. and ſtampe them well together with womans milke, till it be as an ointment, then make a plaiſter of it, and applye it, ſo that none enter into the eye. You may alſo vſe this: ℞. a lilly roote and crabbes &amp; roſt them in the embres, till they be ſoft, then, taking away the core &amp; the pilles of the crabbes, ſtampe them both of like quantitie with the whites of egges, and ſo vſe it: On the ſteppe of the wound, where the ſore was, lay this oyntment, that it maye drawe the fleſhe together, ſo that no ſcarre maye appeare. ℞. <hi>Aloes,</hi> hennes greace, oyle of bitter Almondes, and white waxe, and incorporate them together into an oyntment and apply it. It is very good in all the diſeaſes of the eyes, to annoynt the temples of the patient, and the forehead with <hi>vnguen<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tum Alabaſtrum</hi> before named, for it aſſwageth the payne and helpeth the other medicines in their operation. It happeneth many times in this infirmitie that the patient his eyeliddes, for want of prouident ſkill do reuerſe, which is a great blemiſhe. In this caſe you muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellie with the Raſour deuide the eyelidde from the wound, and part them with a litle roule made of fine linnen clothe dipped in the white of an egge, which you ſhall lay betwixt the lidde and the ſore .xv. dayes together, chaungeing it daylie, and then make the oyntment of hennes greace and white waxe, and lay of it vpon the roule, and it will conſume the wound, ſo that there ſhall appeare no Cicatrice. The like cure you ſhall vſe, when the reuerſement of the eyeliddes is cauſed of ſuperfluitie of bloud. Of the melancholike humour ther is alſo engendred in many men a ſicknes, which groweth between the noſe and the eye, and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth like a peece of lung or light. It is grauelly, and auoideth out alwayes filth. This ſore is called <hi>vulgalpus.</hi> For the cure of it, you ſhall only take a twiche, and lifte the ſore vp ſubtelly, and with the point of a Raſour cutte vp the ſore by the roote, and cauterize it with a hote yron, and vſe the oyntment before rehearſed, which they call <hi>vnguentum ſubtile,</hi> that is hennes greace and white waxe, and annoynt the place with it, till it be hole.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE diſeaſes happen eſpeciallie vnto Maſons, Millers, Carpenters, Wrightes and Smythes: for if any chyue, chippe or duſt skippe into the eye, and through negligence be left behinde, it will incarnate vpon the tunicle ſaluatrice, and then can you not cure the eye, but by remouing and drawing the ſaid chiue, which you ſhall do with your needle, deuiding it cunningly from the tunicle. And if it happeneth that there be any pitte in the place, where it lay, by reaſon that it abode long time therin: then put into the eye the ſtreyns of egges, ordered, as I declared before, twiſe in the day and once in the night, and vpon the eye lay a plaiſter of flexe, and the white of an egge, and within thre dayes it will heale the party diſeaſed. And after this ſort you ſhall alſo remoue the hawe in the eye. But you ſhall in drawing out the hawe, binde two needles faſt together at the toppe, and ſo take the hawe betweene the two pointes, and ſo eaſilie rewling the needles, bring it away. Sometime it happeneth that the eye is ſtung with the Bea or waſpe, or ſome other venymous thing, or blaſted with an infected ayer: and if any of theſe happen, the eye is much diſquieted and grieued, ſo that the patient may take no reſt, and it bolneth vp that he may not ſee. The only cure for ſuche &amp; the like accidentes is this, as I haue by experience often tried. Take a handfull of <hi>Cardus benedictus,</hi> and ſtampe it ſmall, and temper it well with half the white of an egge, &amp; therwith make a plaiſter laying it on flexen herdes, binding it hard to the eye, where it ſhall lye till it be dryed, and then ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plye another: and ſo conſequentlie vſe it till your patient be throughly hole. Theſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties this herbe hath: it aſſwageth ſwelling, and eaſeth the paine, deſtroyeth the venyme, and putteth away bloud from the eyes. This is alſo a preſent remedy for the eyes that are

bloudſhed, when they burne as though there were grauell in them. And thus much for the eſpeciall diſcourſes of ſundry diſeaſes, which do moſt commonly bend to that litle member, the eye, together with their particular cures.</p>

We muſt take heed, that we touch not the vlcerate ton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils with our finger, not ſo much as to touch it ſoftly. For the vnſkilfull, to whome with great error men do ſeeke in doubtfull matters: they do annoy it vehemently, alſo they doe thruſt the aggreiued place, &amp; pull alway the ſcabbe or roue, which they ought not to do, before they ſee the rooue lifted vp, and ſcarce cleauing to the ſore. For if we intend to pull away the ſcabbe, whils it ſticketh faſt, the vlceration will pearce more deep, and inflammation will followe, and the paine will increaſe, and they will come to venemous vlcers. Therfore it is good to blowe in dry remedies, and to annoint liquid thinges with a feather. Dogges doung mixed with hony and annointed, taketh away the rooues maruellouſly, which wilbe the better, if the dogge be fed only with bones two dayes before. It helpeth greatly, nether hath it any vnſauorines being miniſtred in meates. Alſo the aſhes of ſwallowes burnt, and the aſhes of Centory <hi>minor</hi> burnt, with hony mixed is good. After the irritations and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinges made by medicines, you muſt appeaſe it with decoction of lycorice, and with a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gariſme, which is made of maſticke, mirrhe, <hi>Tracaganthum, amylum</hi> and ſaffron,<note place="margin">

                  </note> miniſtring alſo, while the vlcer feedeth, milke mixed with <hi>terra lemnia</hi> to gargariſe. What need many wordes? You muſt be diligent and carefull, ſpecially in clenſing and purging the vlcers. Many infantes do ſuffer the crampe in purging of the vlcers. Some be ſtrangled, becauſe the way of ſwallowing is dryed vp. It is good to apply outwardly fomentes, and emplai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, with taking heed, leaſt we do coole it. For the cure will proſper, if the matter, that is holden within, can be drawen outward. Therfore alwayes after the taking of the plaiſters away, couer the partes that be about the chinn, by laying vpon it ſoft woll, ſprincled with <hi>oleum nardinum.</hi> To conclude, when the ſkurfes are looſened, and the vlcers purged, vſe this remedie following. ℞. flours of red roſes. <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>.iij. ſaffron. <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>.j.ſs. <hi>Balauſtiae.</hi>

The gnawing a ſunder of thoſe vaines is cauſed of ſharpe humours either falling from the head to the lounges, or els engendred in the lounges it ſelfe. Moreouer the bloud, that is ſpit out, ſometime com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth from the breaſt and the lounges, or from the <hi>Trachea arteria,</hi> and ſometime from other places of the mouth or gummes, or the iawes, or from the ſtomake, vnto the which doth fal bloud out of the veyns and members adioyning (that is to ſay) from the liuer &amp; the ſplene.

And when thou haſte annoynted the partes of the body, and rubbed them well, then you muſt come to the bone, and that you muſt likewiſe firſt rubbe with a linnen cloth, and then with oyle: from that you, muſt go againe to the legges, and then to the armes, and ſo againe to the backe, and ſo you muſt do all, and that in a bright chamber without moiſture, whoſe ayre muſt be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perat.

But if there pulſe be very ſmall and feeble, or alſo beſides that wonderfull inequall, you may know that there is extreme perill: but yet you muſt do as it is taught before, and go about none other thinge. But if the pulſe be indifferently ſtrong and great, and be not cut of, nor thruſt together, then you muſt conſider the ſtate of the belly, and if it do not auoid ordure ſufficiently of it ſelfe, you may poure in ſomwhat boldly beneath.

For the cure, you muſt diligently conſider which grief it is, whether it be a diſeaſe cauſed only of the ſtomach, or of the whole body, or of ſome other member. For if humours do flow into the ſtomach from ſome other member, or from the whole body; you muſt firſt take care for the whole body, or for that member that is diſeaſed, but yet you may not neglect the ſtomach altogether. For vnleſſe the whole body be firſt purged of vicious humours, he laboureth in vaine that goeth about to reſiſt the flowing of humours into ſome one place. So alſo he that doth cure the member that is firſt diſeaſed, he cutteth of as it were the fountaine of all flowinges into the ſtomach. Yf you will knowe how thoſe members are to be cured that doe ſend excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes into the ſtomach, you muſt learne that in ther proper chapters before or after.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> Doglike appetite is contrarie to loſſe of appetite. For they that are thus diſeaſed, they deſire much meate: and when they can not reſtraine their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, they deuour in meate without meaſure: then they being heauie with the multitude of meate, and their ſtomach not beinge able to beare the meates, that are in it, without hurt, they turne to vomiting. Then afterward they fill them ſelues with meate, and againe they returne to vomiting like dogges. It is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through colde diſtempure of the ſtomach, or through vicious and ſharp humours which do gnaw and pricke the mouth of the ſtomach. For cold vicious humours do cauſe a gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much like the proportion of ſucking, and do raiſe appetite of meate. Alſo ſometime it chaunceth thorough vnmeaſurable diſſipation and ſpreading abrode of the whole bodie, which do followe either the violence of heate, or the weakeneſſe of the vertue retentiue. Cold diſtempure of the ſtomach is knowen by euill digeſtion,<note place="margin">

If it be cauſed of vnmeaſurable diſſipation and ſpreading abroade, and that through heate which conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth the meate like fire, and rarefieth the ſkinne: then the egeſtions ſent out by the bellie, be leſſe in quantitie, then the meate that is eaten, and alſo the egeſtions be drier: But if that diſſipation come through weakeneſſe of the retentiue vertue, which cannot maiſter the meates:<note place="margin">

And yet it addeth ſtrength to the ſtomach, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde it will not eaſilie receaue any hurtfull humour. Therefore that is the beſt remedie for vicious humours, ſtuffed in the ſtomach, to bring them foorth. It is miniſtred the weight of <g ref="char:dram">ʒ</g>.iiij. with wine infuſed with warme water.

You maye well giue them great plentie of wine, euen as much as they can drink, and ſuch wine that doth heate greatly, as thoſe do that be yellowe in colour, thinne in ſubſtance, ſweete in ſmelling, and without reſtriction.

Therefore they that are troubled with great hunger, in a iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney without a feuer, or any other wayes, you muſt recomfort them with vinegre, or peny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>royall, giuen them to ſmell vnto, or earth whatſoeuer it bee, ſprinckled with vinegre, or apples, or peares, or ſuch other like fruite which is next hande.

For by ſuch odoures and ſauours they that haue this diſeaſe, are for the moſt part refreſhed, ſeeing there is nothing (as wee ſayed before in the ſecond booke, the fourteenth chapter) that doth refreſh and renue the ſtrength ſooner then odours. Moreouer you muſt binde the extreame partes of them with bandes, and you muſt put the tippes of their handes and feete in verie hote water, and you muſt raiſe them and ſtirre them, as well by prickinge of the cheekes, as alſo by pullinge of the heare and eares. And when he is ſomewhat come againe to him ſelfe, you ſhall miniſter vnto him breade infuſed in wine, or ſome ſuch thing, which doeth reſtore ſtrength verie quickelye, (as be) reare egges, Alica with wine. The next remedie they muſt looke for by meate, which if they can not take when it is offered them, you muſt put it into the mouth violentlye, and compell them to ſwallowe it, for by and by after that, they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from their great hunger, and from their fayntinge, and are rayſed quicklye.

Alſo you may know of them the ſhortneſſe of ſleeping: you may knowe if the meates their ſelues were of euill quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by his belkinges and ſauours, like thinges roſted or burned. For in them that be hoate and cholericke, the belkinges or corruptions ſauour like meate roſted or burned.

Therefore you muſt eſpecially take diligent heede to the meaſure, and quantitie of your meate, and you muſt refraine your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, and eate no more then your ſtrength is able to ſuffer. Alſo you muſt beware of euill order (that is) that you do not firſt eate quinces, or pomegranates, or ſome ſuch like thing: and afterward to eate pot herbes out of oyle of ſauce made with ſalted fiſh, or other things which do ſoften the bellie. Alſo you muſt eſchewe eating out of due ſeaſon (that is) that you do not eate before ſome moderate exerciſe, or before yeſterdayes meat be well diſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and alſo not before your accuſtomed houre. Alſo you muſt eſchewe all thinges that be hard by nature to digeſt: as is fleſh that is hard by nature, that is, bieffe and hartes fleſh, alſo eſchewe all old fleſh. Alſo you muſt beware of meates that be fatte, or that be poudred in ſalt, and ſtale kept. Among pot-hearbes, thoſe that be verie hote, or verie coulde, or alſo thoſe that engender wind, be hurtfull.

When there commeth an vnpleaſant belking, declaring manifeſtly that there is corruption of meates: without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing you muſt prouoke vomite, and by drinkinge of warme water, you muſt conſtraine all that is corrupt to come foorth. For if they remaine in the ſtomach, they cauſe tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge and wreſtlinge and heauineſſe of the head: and ſometimes they ſende foorth cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler vpwarde and downewarde,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vomitus.</hi>
                  </note> or they cauſe fluxe of the wombe or feauers. Therefore ſuch as can not digeſt but hardly, wee accuſtome them longe tyme before, that they maye vomite eaſilie, for that is beſt in manie perilles. And if anie be harde to vomite by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and be ill diſpoſed to drinke coulde thinges, in anie cauſe it is not inconuenient to giue him a cuppe of pure coulde water to drincke, for the ſtomach beinge ſtrengthened, it ſoone thruſteth out thoſe thinges that ſticke in it, and ſendeth them downe to the lower partes. Then the next daye let the ſicke be kept in quiet and reſt, and vſe rubbinges of his feete, and chafing of the ſides, vntill the rumbling and windineſſe breake out beneath, and vntill the belkinges do come foorth with a gentler qualitie. And then it is good to riſe vp, that firſt the bellie may ſende out the corrupt thinges by ſeege, and afterwarde let the ſicke walke moderately, and let him be idle, becauſe of the troubled vapours, which be aſcended into the head through corruption. After this he muſt apply his minde to daylie buſineſſe without perturbation and indignation. Then againe the bellie muſt be prouoked to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide thoſe thinges that remaine yet. Afterwarde you muſt bidde him reſt, and you muſt powre vppon and nouriſhe the feete with warme water: and the face being waſhed with pure coulde water, let him reſt in his bedde, and procure him to ſleepe by all meanes. After which let him vſe a little walkinge, and then a Bathe. After bathinge let him take meate moderately,<note place="margin">

Therefore let them be vſed moſt before meate after the rubbings in the morning, and two houres before exerciſe.</p>

For if this fluxe <hi>diarrhaea</hi> be cauſed through the weakenes of the inſtrumentes that ſerue for digeſtion (as is) the ſtomach, the bowels, the liuer and the ſplene: you muſt ſeeke the ſignes of theſe out of their owne chapters. But if it be cauſed through much deuouring of euill meates and drinckes, you may know it partly by the patients tale, and partly alſo by thoſe things that come forth by ſeige. For if they be cholericke they be yellow of colour, &amp; they be not caſt out without feeling of gnawing &amp; heate: alſo the patient feeleth bitternes of the mouth, thirſt, thinne ſtate of the body, &amp; other tokens which ſignifie choler.

For thoſe humours which are ſtopped being caried vpward doe cauſe paine in the head, or phrenſie, or litargie, or impoſtumation behind the eares not without daunger. Therefore in the beginning you may not ſtop the fluxe, which floweth profitably for the health of the body.

For it both ouerturneth the ſtomach, and cauſeth inflammations of the bowels, it kindleth thirſt and reſtoreth feauers, and cauſed the euils aforeſaide, and generally cauſeth a worſe diſeaſe. Therefore if there be aboundaunce of cholericke humours in the body: nature muſt be expelled with eaſie purging medicines, (as is infuſion) of rewbarbe, <hi>caſia fiſtularis,</hi> the barkes of mirabolanes, <hi>Citrine</hi> or <hi>manna.</hi> After that giue cowes milke or goates milke warme, being new milked: or ſeeth it at the fire and ſtirre it continually, till it be conſumed vnto the third part: which you may doe by quenching of redde hote iron, or ſteele gaddes in the milke often, but while it ſeetheth you muſt take the ſcume or ſome of it. For ſurely you can finde noe quicker re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy againſt fluxes of choler. And becauſe the milke that is eaten of one that hath a feuer, is wont to turne into a burning ſauour, or alſo ſharpe or ſoure, and ſo cauſeth more hurt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> good: therefore if the patient hath a feuer togeather with this fluxe, you ſhall eſchew mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtring of milke to him, dreſſed after rhat ſorte. But you muſt poure the fourth part of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the milcke, and ſeeth it vntill halfe be conſumed, and then miniſter it vnto him. If the choler be heaped vp togeather in the bowels, you muſt caſt in cliſters made of the decocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of barcley, with ſuger, roſet, oyle of roſes, yolkes of egges and ſuch like.

The ſecond is when waterie bloud, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> like vnto the water, wherein bloodie fleſhe being newe killed, hath bene waſhed and ſooked, is ſent out: which chaunceth through weakeneſſe of the liuer.

                     <hi>Teretes.</hi>
                  </note> according to their thickneſſe they be round and a hand breadth in length, and ſometime longer, and they be commoner then other. They be often in the ſlender and ſmall guttes, and they go into the ſtomach, and therefore they are voyded often by the mouth, and to ſome alſo they come out at the noſthrilles. And this kind of wormes is peculiar to infants &amp; chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and boyes, and girles. The ſecond kinde of wormes called <hi>Lati,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lati.</hi>
                  </note> be broade and longe like a gard or band. They be of incredible length as Plinie witneſſeth, lib. 2. cap. 3.3. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time they are ſeene three hundred foote long, and ſometime more. This kind of worme (as <hi>Paulus</hi> and <hi>Aetius</hi> witneſſe) is nothing elſe but a permutation and chaunging of the thinne filmes going about the ſmall guttes within, into a certaine liuing bodie, that will moue and ſtirre. The third kinde of wormes called <hi>Aſcarides,</hi> be thinne and ſhort like ſmall wormes.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aſcarides.</hi>
                  </note> They be found moſt commonly in the right gut, and in the end of the fundament. All the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore kindes be engendred and cauſed of crude, rawe, groſſe, and fleugmatike mater,<note place="margin">

                  </note> and of the ſtomach, thinne and ſmall coughes, and oftentimes prouoking and drie. In manie there followeth yeſking and ſleepe with mouing of the ſtomach: and alſo they do ariſe vp vnrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonablie. Manie do awake and leape vp with noyſe &amp; crying out, &amp; fall aſleepe againe: but ſome do both put foorth their tongue, &amp; ſhut their eyes and be quiet, and keepe ſilence, &amp; do fret &amp; fume with them which raiſe them, becauſe they cannot watch they be ſo weake. Some haue their eyes ſprinkled with bloud, and a pulſe that is vnequall, obſcure, fayling &amp; running backe. Alſo to manie there chaunceth loſſe of appetite. Children, while they ſlepe do chewe their tongue, and alſo faſhioning of their mouth as though they ſucked or recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued meate. Alſo to ſome there chaunceth gnaſhing of the teeth. But theſe things are done by little and little and betweene whiles. To ſome they runne foorth into the ſtomach, and do cauſe gnawing and diſpoſition to vomit, and the pacients refuſe meate: and if they be compelled to eate, they ſcarce can ſwallowe that which they take, or they vomit it vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. In manie the bellie doeth throw out corrupt meates, and is puffed vp like as it were a timpanie. The reſt of the bodie it doth conſume and make leane without reaſon, neither faſting going before, nor vnmeaſurable purging being made. Alſo it chaunceth ſometime the face to be made verie red, ſpecially about the balles of the cheekes: but this colour tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth againe into ſwartneſſe. Some do ſpeake fooliſh thinges in their ſleepe like franticke perſons. Some chaunge the place that they lie downe in, and tumble, and caſt them ſelues from place to place: they increaſe feuers in them without order with vehement coldneſſe of the extreme partes, hauing fittes the third or fourth day without order. But alſo theſe ſignes
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:13038:62"/>
and tokens altogether which we haue now rehearſed, muſt not euerie one of them be loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for in euerie bodie: but the chiefeſt of them &amp; ſometime manie. Brode wormes do bring continuall gnawing of the ſtomach, and an impotent, and incorrigible appetite to meate. For the worme that is in the guttes,<note place="margin">

                  </note> deuoureth the meate that is eaten, ſo that he hath need of more ſtraight way, and except he eate ſtraight way, the bowelles are gnawne: they that are thus diſeaſed there followeth ſlenderneſſe and weakeneſſe of the body with inequality.

                  <hi>Aſcarides</hi> do raiſe a vehement itch in the fundament, and do prouoke the patient to go to the ſtoole continuallie. And they that be troubled with this diſeaſe, for the moſt parte be the better after egeſtion and eaſing of themſelues. Let their diet be hote and dry, ſpecially if the pacient lacke a feauer, and let them vſe meates of good iuice, and which will ſoone be diſperſed throughout the whole body: and ſuch as do not increaſe the cauſe that ingendreth wormes. Therfore all meates are to be eſchewed, which can ingender fleugmaticke humours. Moreouer they that are troubled with wormes, muſt be nouriſhed and fed liberally, and may not ſuffer hunger: becauſe the wormes, except they haue meate to feede on, they then by and by gnawe the hard partes of the bodie: but giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meate at that time, ſpecially when they are not altogether emptie.

Therefore when many haue not ſpied and knowen this, it commeth to paſſe for lacke of heede taken to auoide the wormes, that they be gnawen and eaten of them, and ſo being pulled and gnawne, they die.

He hath a ſharp feuer, a ſmall and drie cough, an infaciable thirſt, abhorringe of meates, hardneſſe and difficultie of breathinge, the colour of the tongue firſt redde and afterward blacke. Vomites aſwell of pure choller, as alſo like yolkes of egges, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde alſo ruſty, the belly is coſtiue. Alſo the colour of the bodie is chaunged, like as in the yellowe iaundiſe, alſo hee hath the hicket. In the time of their fitte they are taken with a certaine rauing, and do voide foorth ſharpe vrine. The inflammation that chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth through cauſes in the crooked and hollowe partes of the liuer, do cauſe abhorring of meate, diſpoſition to vomit vomits of choler, and vnquenchable thirſt. The inflammation, that ingendreth in the outward and round partes of the liuer, cauſeth the patient to haue greater paine in drawinge of breath then the other, and do raiſe a greater cough, &amp; it doth ſtretch out paine vnto the right part of the necke, ſo that it ſeemeth to plucke it of. Alſo it chaunceth ſometime, that the muſcles leaning vppon the liuer be enflamed: therefore manie being deceaued, do thinke it to be an inflammation of the liuer. Therefore it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie to tell the differences betweene theſe. For if the liuer be inflamed, there followeth a round ſwelling, faſhioned like the liuer, which will alſo be faſhioned accordinge to the laying of the bodie. For it appeareth greater, when the bodie is tourned downe on the lefte ſide, and againe leſſer, when it is tourned to the right ſide. For the liuer going vnder the baſtard ribbes, it neither appeareth to the ſight, nor to the feeling. Againe the thinne ſkin, inclining to the inflammation of the liuer, it apperreth to haue a naturall faſhion. If the muſcles be enflamed, the ſkinne is ſtretched out round about, ſo that if one would pull it vp with his fingers, he can not eaſilie. Moreouer there appeareth a ſwelling according to the placing of the muſcles, that lye vppon the liuer, long in faſhion and manifeſt to ſight &amp; feeling.

But if the iaundeis be cauſed through obſtruction of the bladder that receiueth the choler, then two ſpeciall remeadies muſt be vſed: blood letting &amp; pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging.

The belly being purged, you muſt againe miniſter medicines, which do purge the entrailes. For which purpoſe the roote of, <hi>Cyclaminum</hi> beaten and druncke is onely good: for this doeth not onely purge againe the intrailes, but alſo it is moſt meete, to ſhut out the choler, by ſwet in the whole ſkinne all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer.

The liuer is affecte by the ſpleene being colde and by the ſtomach and the bowelles, alſo by the longes, the reynes, and the mydriffe. Alſo it chanceth through vnmeaſurable auoyding of the hemorhoydes: or through womans fluxe,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:13038:70"/>
or through retention of menſtruis, or through ſoule other great affection of the wombe. For in all theſe the liuer hath no vnnaturall ſwelling: and yet the bodie is taken with the dropſie, onely through refrigeration of the liuer, affected in the beginning. But afterwarde ſometime it alſo waxeth harde, which is euident to be ſeene in them, which through vntimely drincking of colde water, haue their liuer cooled on heapes, ſo that the dropſie followeth by and by, before the liuer be lyfted vppe into a knottie ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.

Alſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward it is groſſe and filthy, and there be vehement feuers preſent. And if the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion increaſe ſtill, all theſe ſignes wax more vehement. To theſe commeth diſpoſition to vomite, and gnawing of the ſtomach, and vomiting of choler.

There followeth vehement abhorring of meate, and to ſome there are continuall exacerbations, but to ſome betweene whiles. And gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie egeſtion of the wombe, and much excretion of vryne do go before thoſe paines. The ſicke muſt ly in a verie ſoft bed: and the firſt day he muſt abſtaine from meate, but you may not extend his faſting to manie dayes.

And if the paine be not eaſed by thoſe things that be applied outwardly: apply a cupping glaſſe to the loynes, &amp; the guts, &amp; ſcarification being made, you muſt draw out much bloud.

Moreouer the meſtruis doe not flowe in them, whoſe bloud is either groſſe or clammie, or if it be ſent to ſome other parte of the bodie, and purged out, as for example, if it goe out at the noſe, or at the fundament. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in ſome that haue caſt out much bloud from the breaſt, the menſtruis are ſtopped, and in ſome, becauſe much bloude hath gone out of a veine being cut. Alſo other kindes of emptyinges hath often done the ſame thing, as aboundaunt ſweating, continuall vomiting, fluxes of the bellie: and all kindes of puſtules and wheales which budde out of the skinne. Beſides the cauſes nowe rehearſed, oftentimes the menſtruis are withholden through great and ſharpe ſickeneſſes, and through aboundaunce or ſcarcitie of foode. For of little foode, that little doeth expirate and breath out ſtreight, and of much foode the paſſages are ſtopped, and the excretion and voiding out of the menſtruis is preuented and letted. And for thoſe cauſes the menſtruis are ſpecially ſuppreſſed &amp; ſtopped, the whole bodie being euill affected. Alſo they are in like manner withholden and ſtopped, when the wombe it ſelfe is afflicted with a particular diſeaſe or vice: which thing chaunceth to the wombe ſometime through hote or colde diſtempure of the ſame. Alſo many times the purgation of the menſtruis is letted through hardenes engendred in the mouth of the matryce, or through ſome excreſcence and growing vppe of a peece of fleſhe, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo through aboundant fatneſſe. Alſo to ſome by and by in the beginning, certaine filmes or thinne skinnes engender about the necke or entrie of the matrice. To other ſome the ſcarres of vlcers, which haue bene before in the wombe, haue ſtopped the mouthes of the veſſelles, which caried bloud into the wombe. To ſome after the aborſion of the wombe, (the mouth of it being exulcerate, and afterwarde healed and brought to a ſcarre) there commeth conioyning &amp; compaction of it, which beſides that, it letteth all other tranſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the wombe, it alſo ſtoppeth the excretion and voiding out of bloud. Moreouer ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne carefulnes, immoderate feare and great ſorrowe doe ſtoppe the menſtruis. There followeth ſuppreſſion and ſtopping of the menſtruis, heauines of the whole bodie,<note place="margin">

Alſo there followe continuall feauers, and blackiſh vrines, with certaine red attre, and filth in them, euen like as one ſhoulde mixe ſoote with the water wherein newe killed fleſhe hath lately bene waſhed.

                  </note> if ſhe fall on her haunches, the pannicles and filmes, that holde vp the womb, and the members adioyning do breake and cauſe this diſeaſe. Alſo it chaunceth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie times that in a ſore trauell of child birth, the womb falleth out becauſe of the drawing out of the ſecundine, which, the womb that ioyneth to it doth follow. Alſo many times it chaunceth through negligent and vnſkilfull drawing out of the child, ſpecially if it be dead. Moreouer it chaunceth ſomtime through a ſtripe, or lifting vp of a great weight, or through vehement perturbation of the mind, as death of children, or comming of enemies, or tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough perillous ſayling, or through ſome ſuch like cauſe, all the bodie being louſened, the womb falleth out. Alſo ſometime this euill chaunceth (all the whole being looſened) tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough reſolution or weakeneſſe of the pannicles and muſcles, which thing chaunceth ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to them that be olde. Oftentimes the womb falleth out, through the flowing downe of an humour much in quantitie and clammie. It falleth out moſt commonly by the mouth of it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Signa.</hi>
                  </note> and that which falleth out, is like to the egges of an oſtrich, differing only in that, that it is bigger, or leſſe in quantitie. There is no neede of manie ſignes, becauſe the diuerſitie of cauſes may partly be knowen by the conſtitution and ſtate of the bodie, and partly alſo by the telling of the ſicke, and them that be with them dayly: when this diſeaſe is but newly begunne,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Curatio.</hi>
                  </note> you muſt endeuour to put vp the wombe againe, and to reſtore him into his owne place, for in the beginning it will be obedient to be put vp readily, and being in his owne place, it will tarie ſo ſtill, ſpecially if age agree vnto it. For in them that are well ſtricken in age, the wombe being put vp againe, it ſlideth out againe through euery light cauſe. It is good therefore, if there be hard dong in the right gut, to bringe it out with a clyſter.

If all the wombe be inflamed, it will be painefull all ouer, but if ſome part of it be vexed with an inflammation, then the paine is greateſt in that part. For if the hinder parts of it be vexed with infla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mation, the paine will afflict the loynes moſt, and hard dong is withholden and ſtopped, becauſe then the right gut is preſſed together verie much.

Afterward you ſhall place the ſicke in a dark houſe, which is moderately warme, biddinge her to be quiet, and prohibiting all mouing from her legges.

For the naturall forme of a child com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming foorth is, firſt with his head, (his hands being ſtretched out vpon the thighes) &amp; with his head declining to the neither parts, but ſtraightly directed to the mouth of the matrice. the beſt forme in comming foorth, next vnto this, is, firſt with his feete, hauing the hands ſtretched vppon both the thighes, and ſo deſcending ſtraight vp. All other formes in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming foorth, except theſe two, are contrarie and abhorring to nature. The trauaile is made difficile through the Secundine: if it be not pulled away, becauſe of the groſſneſſe or thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of it, or if it breake before it ſhould do, becauſe of the thinneſſe of it. For then, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moure that is gathered together in the matrice, is ſent out before the conuenient time. Therfore the priuities be without moiſture, and be drie at the time of the trauaile, when moyſtneſſe were neceſſarie, which ſhould make a ſlipperie, &amp; eaſie, going out of the child, and ſo through drineſſe, the childe ſlideth out hardly. Alſo difficultie in childe-birth is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred of outward cauſes: as of colde, which thickeneth the matrice, and maketh the paſſages ſtraighter, or through a great heate, which diſſolueth and weakedeth the ſtrength. But outwarde cauſes are knowen by the telling of the pacient, or of them that ſitte by her. Weakeneſſe of the woman that laboureth,<note place="margin">

                  </note> as fatneſſe may be knowen by the ſtate of the bodie. Alſo by diſeaſes, that ſhee hath had before, you may readily come to the knowledge of weakeneſſe, and of many other euilles. Weakeneſſe of the childe is knowen by feeble and ſlowe mouing of it. Which if it be dead, it moueth not, and there is coldneſſe of the belly, and great paine about the nauell. Alſo a ſtinking breath is breathed out, &amp; a naughty colour of the face. Greatneſſe of the childe may be coniectured by the conſtitution of the parentes bodie, and by greatneſſe of the womans belly. Groſſeneſſe and thickeneſſe of the ſecundine may be gathered &amp; known thus: if none of the aforeſaid ſignes be preſent, and the woman ſtrong and luſty, and the child moueth quickly and eaſily. As for the cure, it va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieth according to the diuerſitie of cauſes.<note place="margin">

You muſt with your fingers annoint the mouth of the matrice, with butter, oile, ducks greace, hens greace, &amp; ſuch like, &amp; you muſt ſpreade it abroad, &amp; open it wider by little &amp; little.

Alſo the decoction of fenugreeke, or mallowes, or lineſeede, or alſo egs are good, becauſe they are of a loſening &amp; mollifying vertue.

Many do vſe to ſuch violent ſhaking of the body. And if any woman be weake, and haue ſore trauaile in childe birth thorough reſolution of the bodie, you muſt comfort and refreſh the bodie, with medicines that do thicken, and drawe togither, and with ſuch meates and drinkes, as do recreate, reſtore, &amp; ad ſtrength to the bodie: as be inceſſions &amp; ſprinklings with mirtles, vine leaues, pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, roſes, ſmelling to vinegre, and annointinges with wine, mixt with cold oyle of roſes.

And if the head or foote, be ſent out firſt, you may not drawe out the childe taking holde by that member: but put your fingers to the ſhoulders or haunches of the childe, and thruſt vp that againe, which is come forth into the conuenien place, if there be two or three, or mo children, and do thruſt altogether into the necke of the matrice, you muſt driue backe the reſt into the bottome of the wombe, and bring that out firſt, which ſeemeth to be moſt readie: but if it do not come foorth, becauſe the infant is dead, or hath a very great head, or through ſome other cauſe, you muſt come to drawing out of the childe, or to cutting, which is taught aboundantly of <hi>Aetius, lib.</hi> 16. <hi>cap.</hi> 23. and of <hi>Paulus lib.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 74. For it is not our purpoſe to teach handy cure heare. Moreouer if the tunicle or ſecundine of the childe be thicker and ſtronger, then that it may be broken, you muſt cut it. Thoſe that haue the humour, which is contained in the tunicles or ſecundine, flowing and running out before the conuenient time, ſo that the places be dried vp, you ſhall waſh it all about with whites of egges, with the decoction of mallowes, and fenugreeke ſtrained, or with iuyce of Ptiſan warmed.

Alſo the leaues of it will doe the ſame thing.

                  </note> it is called in Greeke <hi>Arthritis,</hi> in Latine, <hi>articularis morbus,</hi> the ioint ſicknes. Sometime, this euill doth ruſhe in ſodainely, being equally diſperſed throughout all the ioyntes. But for the moſt parte, the fluxe is wont to fall in priuilie, and by little and little. For in ſome, paine doth inuade the ioynte of the great toe, but in ſome the ende of the heele is afflicted. Againe in ſome other, the hollownes of the foote is grieued, either through chafeing of the ſhoe, or ſome ſuch like thing. The goute taketh his beginning at the feete, whereupon it taketh the name, and it proceedeth vpward by little &amp; little to the knees, &amp; alſo to the ioyntes of the huckle bones, &amp; the thighes. Afterward to the handes, euery ioint particularly being grieued. They that are taken extreamly with this diſeaſe, they haue paine in the backbone ioyntes, and in the ioyntes of the ribbes, and eye liddes, and to ſome paine in the throte alſo: neither is there anie connexion or knitting of boanes,<note place="margin">

Sorowes, cares, watchinges, and other perturbations of the minde do not onely engender this euill, but alſo doe breede hurtefull and corrupt humours.

And if this feauer doeth ſo encreaſe, that it doeth melt and conſume the whole bodie, and all the harde,<note place="margin">

Likewiſe all other feauers, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender through inflammation of any member, haue diuerſe names, according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitie of the member. Therefore in euerie ſicke perſon you muſt diligently diſcerne fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, which come without diſeaſe of other members, from thoſe feauers which engender through inflammation of ſome member. Of the aforeſaide feauers, ſome be <hi>Typicae,</hi> (that is) certaine and ordinate: and ſome be, <hi>erraticae,</hi> (that is) vncertaine and vnordinate. <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picae</hi> be ſuch feauers, whoſe fittes and ſlakinges from them doe come iuſtly at their appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time. <hi>Erraticae</hi> are ſuch feauers as be contrarie to theſe, for they keepe no certaine and iuſt time, nor any order of fittes, nor the intermiſſion betweene them, as be thoſe feauers, which engender of melancholie, which is moued in cetaine members, and in ſome it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth vnmoueable, in other members it putrifieth, or beginneth to boyle. Hitherto we haue rehearſed the kindes of ſimple feauers: it remaineth therefore, that we declare brieflie the kindes of compoundes and mixt feauers. Therefore compound feauers are cauſed two wayes:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The kindes of compound fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers.</hi>
                  </note> firſt, becauſe theſe feauers aforeſaide (that is) a Tertian, Quotidian, and Quartain, may be mixed togeather without the diſeaſe of any member. Secondarily, becauſe theſe feauers, which be engendred through inflammation of ſome member, may commixe togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

and ioyned togeather, and ſomtime they are altogeather confounded. Complicatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as Galen witneſſeth) is when the feauers inuade the patient at diuerſe houres. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion is, when they begine at one time. There be foure complications or ioyning togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the feauer Tertian and Quotidian (as Galene witneſſeth.) One,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Complications of Quotidians and Tertians.</hi>
                  </note> when a Tertian and Quotidian are mixed togeather being both intermittig feauers. Another is, when an intermitting Tertian is ioyned with a continuall Quotidian. This is called by a peculiar name of the greekes <hi>Hemitritaeus,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Hemitritaeus.</hi>
                  </note> becauſe all his nature hath the halfe parte of ech of the ſayde feauers. The thirde is when an intermitting Quotidian is mixed with a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall Tertian. The fourth is when a continuall Quotidian is ioyned with a continuall tertian. To be ſhorte, feauers of one kinde are complicate and ioyned with feauers of the ſame kinde, as continuall with continuall, and intermitting with intermiting feauers, and tertians with other tertians, and one quartaine with an other quartaine. Alſo it chaunceth many times, that feauers of diuerſe kinds are coupled togeather as quotidians with tertians and each of them with quartaines, and ſometime intermitting feauers are mixed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall feauers. Moreouer after the ſame ſorte, feauers which are engendred with inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ſome members, are ſometime mixed togeather, as if diuerſe members doe ech of them kindle a feauer, proper to them ſelues, or the affection, where they engender be mixed. Seeing therefore, that feauers are compounded and wixed many ſundrie wayes: firſt the kindes of ſimple feauers muſt be with great diligence perfectly learned of them, that ſtudie Phiſicke: for vnleſſe they know them verie perfectly, it can not be that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer they ſhould know well compound feauers.

Therefore Galen doth moſt worthely call this, the moſt ſimple feauer, becauſe it is the ſhorteſt, &amp; the moſt gentle feauer, being nothing malignant. Therefore if any thing in this feauer be committed either by ignoraunce of the Phiſitions, or through intemperance of the ſicke, or by errors of the miniſters &amp; aſſiſtants, wherby it turneth into another kinde of feauer,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cauſae.</hi>
                  </note> that doth not chaunce through the nature of this feuer. <hi>Diaria febris</hi> is cauſed, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as the ſpirite or breath is inflamed &amp; heat aboue nature without any putrefaction or rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tennes. And that chaunceth many wayes: ſomtime through conſtipation binding or thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſkinne, which ſtoppeth &amp; keepeth in, the vapours or ſpirites which were wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to flow out by the poores, which becauſe they be hote and ſharpe, therefore they engender a feauer. Sometime it is cauſed through wearines, and vehement defatigation. Alſo through watchinges, crudities, and lacke of digeſtion, ſadnes, feare, yre, vehement care of the mind, burning of the Sunne, colde, hungre, dronekennes, and ſwelling of the carnelles in the throte,<note place="margin">

                  </note> and ſuch like, which can heate the ſpirites and enflame them. The Signes whereby diaries are knowen, are of two ſortes: for ſome ſignes be common to all diaries, and ſome be proper and peculiar to ech cauſe.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Common ſignes ſix.</hi>
                  </note> The common ſignes be ſix in number, whereof the firſt is the pulſe. For all the diaries, as much as in them is doe chaunge the pulſe in greatneſſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> ſwiftneſſe, and oftnes. But it keepeth exquiſitely that order, ſoftnes and equallitie, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> is according with nature. The ſecond common ſigne is the vrine, which in diaries is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather according to nature, or doth little turne from a naturall ſtate. An vrine, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordeth with nature,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>A naturall v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine.</hi>
                  </note> is ſubrufe in colour, meane in ſubſtaunce, hauing in it a reſidence, white, light, and equall. The thirde token is the equalitie of heate which in all diarie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> feauers is gentle, pleaſaunt, and eaſie. The fourth ſigne is the maner of ending of it, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> all diaries are looſened and ended by a breath or vapour, which cannot be perceiued, or by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> aboundaunt vapours or moiſtures, or ſwete ſwettes. The fifth is the wanting of euill ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomates and accidentes: as be vehement paine of the head and ſtomach, and other parts, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> abhorring of meates, vnquietneſſe, vnſatiable thirſt, and ſuch other like. The ſixth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſigne is, that all diarie feauers be engendred of an outwarde cauſe, which the Phiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at theſe daies cal a primitiue cauſe. But the particular ſignes, whereby ech <hi>Diaria</hi> doth differ from other,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Particular ſig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes of diaries.</hi>
                  </note> be theſe that follow. They which haue <hi>Diaria</hi> feauer, cauſed through watching, there chaunceth to them a naughtie colour, and ſwelling of the face, heauie mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the eyes:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Signes of wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinges.</hi>
                  </note> for they ſcant lift vp the eye liddes, there is moiſtnes of the heares of the eye liddes, and ſmall pulſes. For watching (as Hippocrates ſaith) ſeeing it letteth dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, it engendreth aboundaunce of crude and raw humours and vapours, it diminiſheth the naturall heate, and vnlooſeneth the bodie, whereupon there followeth the tokens a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaide. To be ſhort, watchinges doe reuoke and pull backe nature from digeſting: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they cauſe great cruditie and rawnes, aſwell in the braine, as in the reſt of the bodie, whereupon alſo doth chaunce the tokens aforeſaide. The ſignes of a diarie, cauſed of care and ſorrowe be theſe,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Signes of care and ſorrows.</hi>
                  </note> leannes of the bodie. If ſorrow be the cauſe, it is clearer, if care, it is darker. Alſo hollowneſſe, and drienes of the eyes doth ſignifie both the ſaide effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctes: but in thoughtes and congitations it is leaſt, becauſe the ſpirites and humours are leſſe conſumed. And it is moſt euident in ſorrow. Alſo there follow theſe effectes, a certain vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accuſtomed palenes or ſwartnes, ſo that the ſkinne is deſtitute of her naturall colour. They which haue a diarie through, wrathe or furious anger, they haue neither hollowneſſe of eyes,<note place="margin">

<pb n="173" facs="tcp:13038:94"/>
and their face is redde, and there is loftines of the pulſes. So alſo the ſignes of the reſt of the diaries, being engendred through perturbation of the minde may chiefely be knowen by the pulſes. For in ſadnes the ſpirites are caried inwarde,<note place="margin">

For they that haue this feauer cauſed of botches, or impoſtumations they may profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablie tarie in the aire or fume of the bathe, becauſe it both rarefieth and maketh thinne the ſkinne, and alſo it prouoketh and enticeth ſwette out of the bodie. Neither doeth it hurte thoſe patientes with drines, as it would do thoſe, that haue this feauer engendred of werines, watchinges, cares, and other perturbations of the minde. For ſeeing their body is dried vp altogeather by thoſe cauſes, they muſt be kept from the aire of the bathe, leaſt it augment their griefe. Therefor ſuch may tarie the longer in a bath of ſweete water being made hote, that through the moyſture of it, they may recouer the humiditie that is loſt, and is decayed in them.

They that haue this feauer cauſed through burning of the Sunne, you muſt cure them by and by in the beginning with cooling, and with many bathinges of ſweete water, and onely with pouring on a little oyle without friction or rubbing of it, for it rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth heate. Thinges that doe coole the heade being applyed to it, be oyle of roſes, and of vnripe oliues, and other which be rehearſed in libro primo. Theſe being firſt made colde, and then receiued with wooll, and holden vppe alofte, you muſt preſſe it with your hande, and let it droppe downe vpon the foreparte of the heade, and that continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, while the feauer doeth decline: then afterwarde bring the ſicke into a bathe. If any perſon haue this feauer through colde he muſt alſo be brought to a bathe in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of his fitte, and his head muſt be nouriſhed both before and after the bathing with oyle of <hi>yreos</hi> and <hi>oleum nardinum,</hi> and ſuch like.

They that labour of a <hi>Diaria</hi> feauer through hunger, in the inclination of the fitte, you muſt bring them ſtraight vnto a bathe, and pouring vppon them much ſweete oyle warmed, rubbe them ſoftlie, and you muſt keepe them longe in the water of the warme bathe, that thereby the drienes, which hunger hath cauſed in the bodie, may be corrected and amended by the oyle and the bath. When they be come out of the bath you muſt recreate and refreſh the ſtrength with conuenient meates, &amp; then you muſt bring them againe to a bath, and when they come out againe, (the perturbation with their ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing being ceaſed) you muſt giue them hote water to drincke, and by and by you muſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter iuice of ptiſan, and ſometime they may take luttuſe, and they may eate fiſhes taken out of grauellie places, &amp; being light meate ſodden in a whyte broath, which, what it was in old time, Galen ſheweth in lib. 4. <hi>de ſanitate tuenda.</hi> If the feauer <hi>Diaria</hi> doe chaunce throught cruditie or rawnes of the ſtomach: you muſt firſt conſider, whither the wombe be ſoluble, or elſe coſtiue.

Obſerue &amp; watch how much of the feuerous heate is diminiſhed by this diet. For if the third day in the morning, you ſee verie little of the feuer left, &amp; if there be no ſignes of rottennes of humours in the pulſe nor cruditie or rawneſſe in the vrine: if the ſuſpect houre wherin the feuer tooke the patient the firſt day be after noone, you may boldly waſh the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient quickely long before ſixe of the clocke, but it is ſufficient, if you ende the waſhinge three houres before. Likewiſe if you ſuſpect the tenth houre, you may waſh him vntill the ſeuenth houre, for three houres or foure is ſpace enough betweene the bathing and the fit. When the bodie hath beene heat in the bath, being firſt annointed with ſweete oyle war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and rubbed verie moderately and eaſilie, then by and by it muſt be wiped without and waſhed. Theſe things following do ſcoure and cleanſe moſt moderately (that is) meale of <hi>Eruum,</hi> and of barley, and alſo of beanes. Moreouer <hi>mulſa</hi> which is waterie doeth the ſame.

Stronger ſcourers then theſe, be the froth of ſalt Peter, the ſalt Peter it ſelfe, and then <hi>aphonitrum,</hi> ſope is one of them that is able to ſcoure moſt of all. Moreouer after a bath, you muſt giue the patient no thing, but water, which hath had a little <hi>apium</hi> ſodden in it, although there be three houres ſpace betweene the bathing and the ſuſpected houres. But if the fitte doeth inuade the patient in the euening, or two houres ſooner, then you may waſh him in the morning, and giue him meate, but you muſt giue him onely, iuyce of Pryſan. Then if the ſuſpected houres bring nothing with them, then you may waſh him againe, if you will and giue him meate, but you muſt haue reſpect to the vrine and the pulſe. But if there chaunce anie thing in the ſuſpected houres, you muſt conferre it with the fitte, which you had the firſt day, and then you muſt conſider the vrine, and alſo the pulſes. For all theſe will appeare to be in a meane temperature, when there is left but a little obſtruction. Wherefore you ſhall waſh him the fourth day, and giue him meate, hauing reſpect to the aforeſaide conſideracions: and you ſhall hope that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing will be left the fifth day.

                  </note> The diſcommodities and hurts which do follow cold drinks miniſtred immoderatelie and out of time, be theſe: firſt becauſe it prohibiteth and letteth groſſe &amp; clammie humours to be attenuated &amp; digeſted, whither they haue ingendred ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions or rottennes, or inflammation, or impoſtume, or knobby hardneſſe, or ſuch like affects. As often therefore as a feuer is kindled of ſuch humours cold things are not good for their auoiding: but to this feuer it bringeth much eaſe, becauſe it quencheth the feuer that is alreadie kindled. But yet ſeing the cauſe of the feuer remaineth ſtill, of neceſſitie another fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer muſt be kindled new againe, and manie times a worſe, then that which went before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the bodie is thickned through cold. And this is one diſcommodity not to be neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected. Another is, that cold things hurt manie weake members of the patient, whether they be weake by naturall diſtemperature, or by ſome vice that they haue gotten. So in ſome, it hath bene found that their throte hath bene ſo hurt, that they could not ſwallowe, in ſome, the ſtomach, that they could ſcarce digeſt. In ſome the mouth of the ſtomach, or the liuer, or the gut colon, or the longs, or the midriffe, or the reines, or the bladder, or ſome other ſuch like member is ſo ſtriken with cold, that it is made weake and vnable to do his proper action and office. Manie by immoderate drinking of it out of time, haue by and by bene ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with difficultie of breathing, &amp; with cramp and trembling, and haue had hurt in all their ſinewes. Therefore to be ſhort, in them that haue anie ſwelling of fleume or bloud, or anie knobbie hardneſſe: you may not giue cold water vnto them, nor yet to them,<note place="margin">

And in the feuer you muſt alſo regard two things, the one that the portion of the feuer, which is now kindled &amp; enflamed, may be cured and quenched: the other is, that the portion of the feuer which is not yet kindled may be letted &amp; ſtopped. Alſo two things muſt be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered concerning the rottenneſſe, one is, that the rottenneſſe alreadie engendred, may be healed, the other is, to let and ſtop that which is readie to engender putrifaction. That which is readie to ingender, is cauſed through perſpiration and breathing out, if it be impedite and letted. So that of this other two conſiderations do ſpring: firſt that the humour which is withholden, may be purged and emptied out: ſecondarily to prohibite and keepe in, that which is to be with holden and kept backe. It will be prohibited with thoſe remedies, which do heale obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.

                  </note> You muſt then ſpecially let him bloud, when the whole bodie ſwellleth more then it was wont to doe, or when the veynes be ſwollen vp, or ſtretched out, for that doe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the multitude of humours are voided and emptied out, you muſt next come to the curing of obſtructions, and you muſt miniſter medicines, whereby ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions may be taken awaye.

                  </note> Therefore you muſt vſe to miniſter thoſe thinges that can deliuer the patient from obſtructions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out heate. What thoſe thinges be, wee haue declared before in the ſeconde Chapter of this Booke. When thoſe humours that cauſed the obſtructions be deuided, cut and ſcoured, you muſt aſſay to voide and emptie them out by the wombe or guttes, by the vrine, and by ſweattes. But ſeeing thoſe thinges, which ſhould bring this to paſſe, be hote, of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie the rottenneſſe and the feuer muſt be encreaſed by them. Therefore as much, as we maye, we muſt labour to chooſe ſuch a thing, as doeth heate but little, or, if wee can finde anie, that doeth not heate at all, (as in this caſe a Bath,) you muſt vſe that.

And a litile after he ſayeth, A bath, if ir be diſcreetlie vſed, it mollifieth the harde, and ſtretched partes, and it brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth foorth excrementes or moltinges, if anie ſticke within the ſkinne. Theſe thinges being done, and thoſe humours ſcoured out, which were compact togither in the ſkinne, ſo that the obſtruction and perſpiration impedited be taken away, you muſt come to the Cure of the rottenneſſe.<note place="margin">

                  </note> Therefore at this time you muſt firſt corroborate and reſtore the ſtrength, whereby it may exuperate, and ouercome the rottenneſſe, and be able to digeſt the humoures. And you ſhall heale the putrifaction and rottenneſſe, if you do voide and emptie out by all meanes, that which is corrupted &amp; putrified. That which is left ſtill within, you muſt bring it to an exqulſite meane by moderate motions, and coole breathinges, and you ſhall worke the emptying out of the humoures by vrine, egeſtions, vomiting, and ſweattes.

Alſo this feuer by and by in the beginning, and in euerie fitte cauſeth a vehement cold, rigour, and ſtiffeneſſe, and by this meanes it differeth from a burning feuer, as is before rehearſed. And the cold in this feuer differeth from the cold in a quartaine feuer thus,<note place="margin">

not chaunce without vehement rigour and could, pricking and wounding in the fleſh: but a quartaine feuer doth not by and by the firſt daie inuade the patient with vehement rigour and colde. For as it proceedeth forward and increaſeth: ſo alſo the rigour and cold encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and the patient doth not feele pricking, but rather feeleth great cold, and as it were nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to the bone with it. There is in a tertian feuer an exact and perfect order and equalitie of the pulſes: but yet in the encreaſing of the fittes, the pulſes are raiſed and prouoked to vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie, greatneſſe and fregnencie. Moreouer in the vigour and force of the feuer, it cauſeth thirſt, and burneth vp the patient, ſo that he caſteth of the clothes, to make him bare, and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and he breatheth largely and often, and he bloweth out as it were a flame of fire, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth to drinke cold water. Afterward the heate ſpreadeth equallie all ouer the bodie, ſo that the breaſt is no hotter, then the extreame partes and members. And when you laie your hand vpon him, at the firſt touching you ſhall feele much gnawing, and byting heat, bruſting out as it were with a certaine vapour &amp; moiſture: but not long after your hand will vanquiſh it, if you do holde it ſtill. Moreouer there followeth this feuer vomiting of choler, and the bellie is laxatiue, and they piſſe vrine that is cholerike, ſubrufe, and ſomewhat yealow and moderately thicke. Alſo their vrine hath by and by a white cloud, or a laudable ſublation in the middes. If the vrine be redder, and if in the firſt fitte there do appeare, neither ſublation in the middes, nor cloud, the feuer will extend and remaine ſeuen fittes. Moreouer this feuer leaueth of till another fitte, when the fitte hath endured the ſpace of xij. houres at the moſt. For this is the longeſt time of a fitte in true and pure tertians. But ſometime the fitte is ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the aforeſaid ſpace of time, hauing difference more or leſſe according to the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie and qualitie of choler within, or becauſe of the ſtrength of the patient, or through the preſent affect of the patientes bodie at that preſent time. Therefore we name that an exact and pure tertian feuer, which endeth his fitte within twelue houres: but that which hath a longer fitte, that is not called an exquiſite tertian, but an extended and ſtretched out tertian. And if the feuer doth inuade the patient daily with vehement rigour and cold, and with the ſignes aforeſaid of the vrine and pulſes, as alſo of other thinges afore rehearſed: then it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>duplex tertiana,</hi>

Moreouer in this baſtardly tertian, the ſignes of concoction do appeare more ſlowly, neither is there ſuch great heate in the vigour and ſtate of this feuer, as in the exquiſite tertian.

Therefore the diette in this feuer muſt not be altogether cooling and moiſtening, as it is in an exquiſite tertian: but let it haue ſome power and vertue to heate, cut and deuide: for the choler in this feuer is groſſer, neither is it ſo hote. They therefore that haue this feuer, maye profitiblely take brothe of ptiſan, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome pepper is put, and you muſt giue them <hi>mulſa</hi> to drinke, wherein hath bene ſodden hiſope, origan, and ſpikenard. Alſo you muſt giue them ſoupinges and brothes eaſie to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt. Moreover ſeeing the time of the fitte is long, and ſo endureth a whole daye, you may not giue him meate daily but eache other daye: for by this meanes we ſhall beware and take heede, that nature be not called awaye from her office and worke, and ſo the diſeaſe ſhould be increaſed: for you muſt onely take heede that the diſeaſe doth not increaſe, and that the ſtrength of the ſicke, which muſt ſtriue and fight a great while, be not weakened, debilitate and caſt downe. But it is hard to keepe and ſaue both, becauſe hunger looke how much it profiteth to the digeſtion of the diſeaſe, and ſo much or more it hurteth and debilitateth the ſtrength. And meates, looke how much they increaſe the patientes ſtrength and ſo much they hinder, and let concoction and digeſtion. To conclude therefore, you muſt vſe hunger to them that be ſtrong and luſtie, and their diſeaſe hard to digeſt. And you muſt feede them more largly, whoſe ſtrength is debilitate and weake, and their diſeaſe not ſtubborne for to digeſt.<note place="margin">

                  </note> This feuer doth not by and by in the beginning inuade the patient with vehement rigour and cold the firſt daie, but it is like to them that are cold in winter through vehement froſt: but when the feuer hath continued and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded forward and is increaſed, then alſo the rigour and cold increaſeth with it, and waxeth
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:13038:101"/>
greater and ſtronger daily, till the whole diſeaſe be come to his full increaſe and force. And the cold doth not ſeeme to the patient as it were pricking and vexing the skinne, as it doth in an exquiſite tertian, but there is cauſed vehement cold, and as it would breake the bones. Their pulſes are verie rare and ſlow in the beginning of the fittes, but when the feuer is in his full force, or alſo when it is increaſed, then of neceſſitie the pulſes are ſwift and often: but yet they do keepe their naturall ſlowneſſe and raritie, if you conſider the ſwiftneſſe and frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie comming in the fittes. But the mouing of the heate, the increaſing, and the vigour, and force of this feuer is cleane contrarie to that in tertian feuers. For in this feuer the mela<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>choly humour is kindled and inflamed by litle and litle, as it were a ſtone, or a ſhell, or a bone, or ſome other ſuch like cold and drie bodie. And when that any flame or heate is kindled in it, then in the fitte it leaueth nothing fumous or ſmokie, but it burneth and conſumeth it.

And the intermiſſion and ceaſing betweene the fittes ſeemeth to be exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and pure without any greefe at all: becauſe in this feuer, looke how much melancholie is kindled and inflamed, and ſo much in the time of the fitte is diſperſed, conſumed, and drawen out cleane. Moreouer in a quartaine feuer there followeth not vomiting vp of cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler. Their vrines are thinne, white and waterie, and as it were ſtrained from a groſſer matter. Alſo this feuer beginneth ſpeciallie in Autumne or Harueſt, comming after erratike feuers. But you muſt behold both the nature of the patient, and his temperament, alſo his diet vſed before, his age, the region, and other ſuch like. For if thoſe thinges de cold and drie, then you maie looke more ſurely, that a quartaine feuer will enſue, ſpeciallie if at that time, quartaines be rife among the people. They that haue a quartaine feuer, in the beginning they muſt be handled and ordered moderately and gently,<note place="margin">

                  </note> neither maie they be vexed with any vehement medecine, or by vehement emptying and purging: for the humour which cauſeth the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, is ſtubburne to be drawne and handled. Therfore in the beginning, and before it be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, it will hardly and ſcarcely follow the medicine that draweth it: and that becauſe of his groſſeneſſe and coldneſſe, and alſo becauſe it ſtoppeth the narrow wayes, by the which it ſhould paſſe out.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Bloud letting.</hi>
                  </note> Yet if bloud doe ſeeme to abound much, then you muſt take awaie that. And if when you haue ſtricken a veine, the bloud that commeth out, do appeare blacke and groſſe, as for the moſt parte it doth in diſeaſes of the ſplene, you maie then boldly draw it out. For great aboundaunce of ſuch bloud being drawen out, nature will get the vpper hand in digeſting the reſt of the humour, and will make the feuer ſhorter. You muſt cut the innermoſt veine of the left arme, which is called <hi>lienaris vena,</hi> the ſpleene veine, or <hi>mediana:</hi> for this veine emptieth out the melancholie humour, ſpeciallie from the ſplene, which is wonte to be diſeaſed in a quartaine feuer: but if, when the veine is ſtriken, the bloud doth appeare thinne, and yealowiſh, you muſt ſtoppe it by and by: for ſuch an humour is not vnprofitable in a quartaine, but it correcteth and amendeth the groſſe and cold humour, aſwell bycauſe of his ſubſtaunce,<note place="margin">

Moreouer, let him abſtaine from all thinges which doe coole and drie the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die. He muſt eate birdes that liue vpon mountaines, and do engender good iuice: for thoſe that do liue in fennes and mariſhes, they be vnwholeſome and full of execrementes, and do ingender a groſſe humour. He muſt vſe fiſhes of grauellie waters, which be ſoft and without toughneſſe, but in this feuer ſalte thinges and muſtard muſt be miniſtred in meates, that they maie extenuate, cut, and deuide, the groſſe and clammie humours, and that they maie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume and feede vp the ſuperfluous humiditie and moiſture.<note place="margin">

They maie not altogether be kept and refraine from frictions, deambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and other occuſtomed exerciſes (that is to ſaie) you muſt ſuffer them to vſe exerciſes, but not ſo much as they did in their health.

<pb n="187" facs="tcp:13038:101"/>
that would cauſe perill and daunger of obſtructions. But if exerciſes be vſed moderately, and that in the time of intermiſſion betweene the fittes, they will voide out excrementes and bring other commodities which Galene rehearſeth in lib. 2. <hi>de tuenda ſanitate.</hi> They muſt altogether abſtaine from bathing if they can,<note place="margin">

For parte of that humour, which is not putrified nor rotten as yet, being ſpread by all the veines, or in the reſt of the bodie, ingendreth the rigour and cold, but,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Signa.</hi>
                  </note> the other rotten parte of the humour ingendreth the feuer. A quotidian feuer doth not inuade the patient with rigour and vehement cold by and by the firſt daie, but in proceſſe of time, it commeth rather like a cooling, then like a rigour. The pulſe when the fitte begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth is inordinate and vnequall, ſlow, litle, and weake. Neither alſo in the augmenting and increaſing of the quotidian, is there ſwiftneſſe of mouing of the pulſes, nor greatneſſe, nor ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie. The heate in this feuer is not ſo ſharpe and vehement as it is in a tertian: for it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther burneth them, neither are they compelled to make naked their bodies, and to throw of their clothes, neither doth it compell them to breath much and often, and to blowe out of their mouthes as it were a flame, nor to deſire to drinke cold water, but it is moiſt and ſmoky, and commixed with much vapour. Alſo it is hardly kindled, and it conſumeth a longe time, vntill that, by increaſing, it come to the force and ſtate. Moreouer, they that haue this feuer, do not thirſt, becauſe not onely the tongue, but alſo the whole bodie in this feuer is moſt moiſt. The vrines in quotidian feuers either be white, and thinne, and waterie, or thicke, and troubled. There bruſteth out no ſweate at all in the firſt dayes, neither is there any exact and perfect reſt from being feuerous. For the feuer remaineth eche time almoſt the ſpace of 18. houres. There chaunceth alſo to them vomiting of fleume: and thoſe thinges which are ſent out by egeſtion, are colder, moiſter, cruder, more waterie, and more flegmatike. Alſo a quotidian feuer doeth chiefly, vexe them that be moiſte, and flegmatike of nature. Alſo it chaunceth in a moiſt ſeaſon, ſpecially in winter that is cold and moiſt, and in olde folke and children. Hereupon Galene writeth, that he neuer ſaw a young man that was choletike and drie by nature, taken with this feuer: but they that be older, and moſt flegmatike, hauing a groſſe ſubſtance of the body, and do liue an idle life, ſeruing their belly and giuen to droun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe, vſing bathing often and ſpecially after meate, they are ſoone taken with this quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidian feuer.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Victus ratio.</hi>
                  </note> Let the diet in this feuer be altogether extenuating, cutting and deuiding. Therefore you muſt now ſeeke ſuch places, wherin we haue declared aboundantly, what kind of diet, it ſhould be. In the firſt dayes (that is) when ſignes of cruditie and indigeſtion do yet appeare, the fleume muſt be deuided and cut, and the poores &amp; paſſages that be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Curatio.</hi>
                  </note> muſt be ſcoured and clenſed. And therefore you muſt miniſter <hi>oxymell,</hi> becauſe it doth ſcoure mightly, it cutteth and deuideth the glutinous and clammie humours, and it deliuereth the poores from obſtructions. And you muſt miniſter thoſe thinges which prouoke vrine,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:13038:102"/>
that (the fleume being already extenuated and deuided) may the more readily paſſe by the conduites, and be emptied out. Therefore it is good to miniſter decoction of the roote of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pium, percely, ireos, fennell, and ſuch other like often rehearſed before with <hi>ſirupus acetoſus compoſitus,</hi> and <hi>mel roſarum,</hi> and <hi>ſirupus è duabus radicibus,</hi> and other that haue the vertue and power to extenuate, cut, and deuide. About the vigour and force of the feuer, you muſt take heed and haue regard to the ſtomache, and ſpecially to the mouth of it. Therefore you muſt prepare thoſe thinges, which (being applied outwardly,) may adde ſtrength to the ſtomache, ſuch as be, maſticke, ſpikenard, wormwood, and ſuch other like.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vnguentum.</hi>

The ſtomacke being ſtrentgthened, you muſt compell vomiting, firſt by miniſtring of radiſhe, then after, meates muſt be eaten for ſo it lifteth vp the meates, and cauſeth the eaſier vomite. After he muſt vſe medicines, that doe purge out fleume: for fleume vhen it is digeſt, may conueniently be purged. What medicines thoſe be that can purge out fleume, it is euident in our other bookes, and this here ſuffiſeth to cure a quotidian feuer.</p>

This feuer knoweth no paine, and they that haue it, do thinke that they haue no feuer, neither do they perceiue or feele any heate, ſeeing all the membres of their body be equally heat, (as Galene declareth aboundantly in his booke <hi>de inaequals intemperie.</hi> The feuer ethicke is ingendred and cauſed two wayes.

                  </note> for the moſt parte of burning feuers, which haue continued ſo longe, that in proceſſe of time they conſume the humiditie and moiſture, that is conteined in the body of the hearte, or alſo, if it reſiſt more aboundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, then thoſe feuers are not onely ethickes, but alſo <hi>maraſmodes</hi> (that is) conſuming &amp; mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting feuers: for feuers being ingendred, (the humiditie yet ſtill remaining) when they haue caught and occupied the bodie of the hearte, hereupon they are ſpecially kindled and infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med like the flame of a candle with a matche. And this is one way of ingendring of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ethicke. Another way of ingendring of them is this, when they begin of them ſelues by and by, being ingendred as diary feuers be, either of ſorrow, or anger, or ouermuch wery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, together with burning of the heate of the ſunne. The feuers that be thus ingendred, be not very hard to cure: but ſuch feuers of theſe, as be turned into conſuming and waſting, which the Greekes do call <hi>maraſmos,</hi> through the negligence and ignorance of phyſitions, if thoſe feuers be in their force and ſtrength, and not as it were beginning ſtill,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>.</note> it is not onely hard to cure theſe, but it is alſo impoſſible to remedy them. For the nature of them is hote and dry, ſo that the hearte is in like eaſe, as the ſnafte of a candle, when it is very much burnt. For when it is much burnt, it will breake and diſſolue, and through dryneſſe fall a ſounder, ſo that although you power aboundance of oile to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Alſo there hangeth on the haires of the eye liddes, dry gumme and filth, and vnclenly affectes, as is ſeene in them ſpecially, that goe a long iourney in the duſt, when the ſunne burneth hote. Alſo the vitall

flowre in them periſheth, and the skinne of their forehead is dry and retched out, and their eye liddes wincke often as though they were ſleapy, but their diſeaſe is not to ſleepe, but is rather impotency and debility to watche. Alſo the fleſh of their temples is conſumed, ſo that they ſeeme hollow places, for what other thing haue they but skinne and bone? for if you looke vpon their bare belly, it ſhall appeare to you, that neither bowell nor filme is lefte. The hypochonders and ſides are pulled vpward to the breaſt. And if you touch their ſkinne, it is very drye, which if you take hold on with your fingers, and pull it vp, it is like the hide of a beaſt. The pulſes be thinne, hard, weake and often. The heat when you lay your handes firſt on him doeth ſeeme weake: but a litle after it bruſteth out ſharp and gnawing more and more, if you hold your hand longe vpon him.

                  </note> Therfore an hemitrice feuer is cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when putrified fleume is commixed with rotten choler. It is declared before that a tertian inuadeth the patient with rigour and veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t cold,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Signae.</hi>
                  </note> and a quotidian commeth with cooling of the extreme partes. Therefore the feuer which is compounded of them both cauſeth hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour and ſhaking for cold, which is leſſe, then the rigour of a tertian, and greater &amp; more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t then the cooling of a quotidian: ſo that it is a meane betwene them both. It is ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred two ſundry wayes: for either two fittes are ioyned together by and by at the beginning, and do inuade the patient together both at once, or elſe eche of them co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth ſeparate from the other. Therefore when the tertian doeth exceed the other, it cauſeth a more horrible fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and alſo it hath much rigour and vehement cold in the augmenting of the fitte, and there is preſent greater heate and more burning, and choler is driuen out either by vomiting, or by egeſtion, or it breatheth out a moiſt vapour, but whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the quoditian exceedeth the tertian, then cold is in the extreme partes, &amp; but a litle ſhaking, and neither burning nor thirſt doth

And when the quotidian is of greateſt force, the pulſes and horrour waxe leſſe and gentler: but if the tertian preuaile, by and by the pulſes and horrour increaſe and waxe greater. Note therfore, when a feuer is ingendred of an intermitting tertian, and a continuall quotidian being equall of like force, greatneſſe and ſtrength, then it is called an exquiſite hemitriteus ague: but if one feuer do exceed the other,<note place="margin">

But in an vnpure hemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice, when there is moſt of choler, or moſt of fleume: you muſt alſo vary and chaunge the cure, according to the humour and feuer that aboundeth. For if choler haue the vpper hand, you muſt chiefly vſe the remedies, which we haue declared in the cure of the tertian. But if fleume abound moſt, vſe the thinges moſt that be declared in the cure of the quotidian. To conclude you muſt moſt couet the cure of that which hath moſt neede, and doeth moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, but ſo, that you do not altogether neglect the other. Therefore we neede not in this place rehearſe the remedies, wherby this feuer ſhould be deſtroyed and cured, ſeeing euery man may learne the cure of them, more readily according to the diuerſitie and nature of the humours out of the Chapters of curing of the tertian and quotidian. Therfore if any man do firſt learne to know exactly and perfectly the curing of ſimple feuers, he ſhall alſo know how to cure compound feuers without any more labour: for the cures of ſimple feuers being knowen, and conſidered, it is moſt ready to any man to cure compound feuers, ſo that here we ſhall not neede to write ſeuerally of the curing of compound feuers.</p>

Therefore the chiefeſt cauſe why men are infected with the Peſtilence, is breathing in of ayre, without which no breathing thing doeth prolonge their life. For it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth for the moſt parte of breathing in of ayre which is corrupted of a putrifying and rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting euaporation.<note place="margin">

                  </note> The beginning of corrupted ayre, and of the rotten euaporation, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a multitude of dead bodyes not burned or buried, as it chaunceth in warres, or the eua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration of ſome pooles, fennes or mareſhes in the Sommer time.

                     <hi>Notae.</hi>
                  </note> Hereupon Galene ſayeth, that of all temperamentes of the ayre, the worſe is that, which is hote and moiſt. Alſo oftentimes (as is afore ſaid) naughty and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt diette ingendreth humours in the bodye, that be eaſie and ready to putrifie and rotte, and ſo is the cauſe why ſuch bodyes are infected with the Peſtilence. And then truely they ſpecially haue the Peſtilence, which vſe a naughtie and corrupt diette, and ſo be full of all kindes of ſuperfluities. Therefore it neede not ſeeme marueilous, if ſometime ſome one among many (which yet doeth very ſeldome chaunce) be infected with this diſeaſe, the ayre yet not being peſtilent and corrupt. For they that keepe a good and heathfull diet, and be without ſuperfluities in their bodies, they take no hurte at all, or elſe very litle hurte, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

                  </note> howe it chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth that all men are not taken equallie with the Peſtilence, ſeing euerie one is conſtrained to breath in the peſtilent aire. The firſt cauſe why ſome remaine vnhurt, is becauſe they be not full of ſuperfluous humiditie and moiſture, but do vſe moderate diet and exerciſes, and haue their bodie eaſie to breath out vapours. Another cauſe is, becauſe all mens bodies be not of like diſpoſition and affect. For diſpoſitions of mens bodies are of manie ſundry forms, for ſome bodies are quickly ouercome and infected, and do moſt readily ſuffer any cauſe: but ſome againe be inſuperable, &amp; can not be ouercome, nor will at all ſuffer the infection, or els verie hardlie.

The fourth is, when the windes are often in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſouth and in the weſt in Autumne. The fifth is a darke and troubled aire in Autumne threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> raine, but yet it doeth not raine at all. The ſixt is, if women conceaued with child, do <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> ſuffer aborſion for euerie light cauſe. The ſeuenth is, when in ſommer after raine ſodenlie a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> great aboundance of frogges of diuerſe colours do gather togither on a heape.

And ſeing (as we haue declared in the beginning of this Chapter) it is euident that the peſtilence is not cauſed, but through the breathing in of peſtilent and corrupt aire: there can not be a more preſent remedie to preſerue one,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Flight is the beſt remedie.</hi>
                  </note> then flying from the corrupt aire. For there is no other meanes to auoide the peſtilent ayre, becauſe whether we will or no, wee muſt drawe in ſuch aire, vnleſſe we get vs away into ſome other place, where the ayre is not corrupted nor infected, but pure and good. Which you muſt the rather and more quick- he do if the euill be greatly infectiue. And you muſt flee farre of into ſuch a place whereas the aire is knowen to be pure and good, and deſtitute of corruption, neither muſt you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne home againe from that place verie ſoone. Hereuppon it is not raſhlie ſayde of the Common ſort, that theſe three Aduerbes <hi>Cito, longe</hi> and <hi>tarde,</hi> in the time of the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, do more pleaſure and profite then three ſhoppes verie well furniſhed. Therefore they, that may conueniently for their buſineſſe, flee away let them not ſuffer them ſelues to be perſwaded by anie meanes, to tarie in the peſtilentayre: which if they doe, they ſhall fooliſhlie put them ſelues in daunger of Peſtilent death: but if you may not flee for vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent buſineſſe, and iuſt cauſes, then let your firſt care be, that the houſe in which you muſt tarie, be without all kinde of ſtinke, and kept cleane from all filthineſſe and ſluttiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. Let the windowes of it be iuſt ſhut, ſpeciallie in cloudie and rainie dayes, that the peſtilent aire enter not in. But if you will open them, ſee that they open vppon the eaſt or north quarter, and doe it, when the Sunne is riſen aboue the earth ſome houres. You muſt come abroade but ſeeledome, and not except the element be cleare and bright: neither come then, vnleſſe you haue firſt taken ſome medicine, which is able to preſerue you from the infection. You muſt make fiers daylie in your houſes, with oken wood, Iuniper, <hi>tamariſcus,</hi> laurell or ſuch like, that thereby the corrupt ayre that is in the houſe, may be corrected and purged.

A hote diſcending of a fluxe (ſayth he) aſſone as it hath once placed it ſelfe in the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, firſt the greater arteries and veynes are filled &amp; ſtretched out, then by their meanes the leſſer are diſtended, and ſo it proceedeth vntill it commeth to the leaſt of all. In them, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a fluxe is ſtrongly compact togeather, and can no longer be conteyned, parte thereof iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out through the extreame partes of them, and part is ſtrained out through the holes of the tunicles, and is ſpeadily ſent forth, and then thoſe voide places are filled with the fluxe, which are betweene the beſt and chiefeſt bodies. Thus all thinges proceeding of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour do waxe hote in euerie place, and alſo are ſtill poured forth. And theſe are they the ſynewes, the bindinges or ligaments, the ſmall ſilmes, the verie fleſh, and beſides theſe, the arteries and veynes, wich truely being the principall, are diuerſly and many waies afflicted aboue the reſt. For inwardly by reaſon of the fluxe they are both made hote, and alſo are ſtretched out, and torne and pulled a ſunder. And outwardly alſo, they are not onely made hote, but alſo are ſuppreſſed and made heauy. But the other partes of the bodie, ſome truely are onely made hote or kept downe, and ſome are affected with both. And this diſeaſe is called <hi>phlegmone.</hi> Hitherto Galen. Therefore in ſuch kinde of tumours chauncing beſides nature, which are cauſed of the flowing of humours, ſomething alreadie (at the leaſt waie at the beginning, and before the fluxe did beginne to ſtriue) is made and engendred, and ſomething is yet to come, and reſteth in the generation. That which doth happen as yet, is the matter which went before, which as yet abydeth in the fluxe: but that which is enge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred alreadie, is the ioyned matter, which hath alreadie flowed: and is compact in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieued place. Hereupon therfore there muſt be vſed a dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t care of the Phyſition in ſuch kindes of <hi>phlegmone</hi> which as yet remaine in generation (as in all other tumours alſo, &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, which are yet in begetting, neither as yet haue obtained perfection) as Galen lib. 13. <hi>meth. med.</hi> doth declare the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be known &amp; perceiued, both by that which foreſeeth,<note place="margin">

Antecedent cauſes are thoſe, which of themſelues are fit &amp; materiall to beget any diſeaſe or affect, as are four humours both naturall &amp; not naturall. Naturall humours are thoſe which ſerue to nouriſh the body, &amp; haue their being with the blouds, &amp; are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended vnder the name of bloud. Which if they be ſent out from the veynes &amp; arteries, they do ſodenly congeale &amp; gather togeather, wheather they flow without the body, or do remaine ſtill in the place wherein they be conteined.

But for all this, ſome Phyſitions of our age, and thoſe verie well learned, doe contende that Galene woulde ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte but two cauſes (that is to ſaie) an externall, and an internall (or as they ſaie nowe) a primitiue and an antecedent. Of the which that (he ſayth) doeth happen to the bodie outwardely, which altereth and chaungeth the ſame greatly, the which alwayes is ſeperated, vntill it hath eſtabliſhed his maladie, as heate, colde, the byting of a Scor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion. But the internall hath his being within the bodie, and doth preſently procreate the maladie, as are humours affected beſides nature. But they doe conſtantly affirme, that he neuer ſo much as dreamed of that, which they terme <hi>cauſa coniuncta,</hi> when as accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his opinion, euerie affect which letteth and hindereth the actions and duities of the bodie, is a maladie it ſelfe, and not the cauſe of a maladie, and that <hi>coniuncta cauſa,</hi> which Auicene and his ſecte haue inuented, according to their owne deſcription, which they aſſigne vnto it, is nothing but a certaine kinde of affect letting the execution thoſe duties partayning to the bodie: which is the verie definition of a maladie it ſelfe. And therefore they proue that it nothing differeth from a diſeaſe it ſelfe, which is wonte to preiudice thoſe actions which agree with nature.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Some thincke that coniuncta cauſa nothing differeth from the maladie it ſelfe.</hi>
                  </note> But becauſe one, and the ſelfe ſame o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion hath occupyed all mens mindes of this latter age concerning this triple kinde of the cauſes of all ſuch diſeaſes, it ſhall not ſeeme altogeather abſurde, if that I throughout all this treatiſe of myne, for playneſſe ſake, ſhall deuide and diſtinguiſhe theſe three cauſes, into theſe three kyndes and titles:: I meane <hi>primatiua, antecedens</hi> and <hi>coniuncta.</hi>

In them therefore there is required a diligent and ſingular care of the Phiſition, to declare the cure of them. But theſe common manifeſtations, according to the difference of the Tumour it ſelfe, and the nature of the affected membre, doe verie much differ and alter. For truely in all Tumours alreadie ingendred, and in euerie part of the bodie, the euacuation of that which annoyeth, and infeſteth, is in no caſe to be vſed and
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:13038:114"/>
miniſtred, as Galene teacheth <hi>libro</hi> 2. <hi>ad Glauconem,</hi> and in the places aboue recited, which alſo ſhall manifeſtlie appeare in that which followeth. But we muſt not cure thoſe tumors with ſuch remedies, which are yet but beginning and occupying euerie member, or emptie, out that which is alreadie ingendred in them, but we are enforced (if we intend to followe the right order of curing) to vſe ſometime one remedie, ſometime another, which is of force to ſtop the fluxe, and auoide out that which is engendred, ſo farre foorth, as the kinde of the tumoure and the nature of the affected member doeth require.<note place="margin">

                  </note> But in the nature of affected members foure thinges chieflie are to be conſidered. vidz. their temperature, their forme or faſhion, their ſituation or place, and their power and ſtrength.

Except you will with Galene comprehend and containe it vnder the laſt thing, which is the vertue and ſtrength of the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour. Theſe things therefore alſo doe much alter that generall order of curing, which is commonly obſerued throughout all kinde of tumours aboue nature. It is therefore requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite, that, in curing thoſe tumoures which chaunce beſides nature, we remember all thoſe declarations which are taken from them. For <hi>Phlegmone,</hi> or anie other tumour which hath his abode in the fleſhie parts of the bodie, is otherwiſe cured then thoſe which are ſituated in the ſinewie places: otherwiſe in the eye, then in the knee or neck: and otherwiſe are the kernels in the throte cured, then thoſe which are reſident in other parts of the bodie.

For bloud doeth flowe verie aboundantly (ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time one or other member ſending it foorth) and that part doth entertaine and receaue it, which beginneth to be affected with <hi>phlegmone</hi>: but ſometime that member which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted doeth drawe it vnto it ſelfe.

But they which are attractiue, do draw or pull with a ſicklie heate or griefe.

                  </note> as we haue already declared. Therfore of all theſe, there are three intentions or orders of curing thoſe tumours, which haue their beginning of flowing, collected &amp; ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered of the later ſort of Chirurgians. 1. The firſt is to turne away the fluxe, &amp; preuent it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together. 2. The ſecond is, to mitigate the griefe, &amp; altogither to remoue that cauſe, for the which, the member intertaineth or alſo draweth the flux vnto it. 3. The third is to empty out all that humour that hath flowed to the aggrieued place. But how the firſt intention ſhould be finiſhed, Galen hath fitly taught <hi>li.</hi> 13. <hi>meth. med.</hi> where he declareth vnto vs all the waies to auert &amp; turne away the flux, &amp; the meanes to ſtop &amp; inhibite <hi>phlegmone,</hi> which as yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth in generation, writing after this manner: when humours are equally augmented a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them ſelues (which the Greekes call <hi>plethora</hi>) yea alſo when all the bodie is void of excrements &amp; doth containe a mediocrity of iuicie humours, (paine &amp; the heate of that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber alſo wherin <hi>phlegmone</hi> raigneth raiſing the flux) through the emiſſion of bloud we helpe and remedy <hi>phlegmone</hi> which now beginneth to rule. <hi>Plethora</hi> alſo is cured both with often bathing and with exerciſe, and alſo with much friction and rubbing. Furthermore it is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by medicines that will digeſt, ſo that a feuer be not preſent, and beſides all theſe it is hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped through hunger, &amp; a good diet, although the ſick be feuerous. But when the body is ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fed either with melancholie, or choler, or fleume, or with other clammie &amp; viſcous humors (which ſtate of the bodie the Greekes call <hi>cacochymia</hi>) the euacuation thereof muſt be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured by a purgation,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cacochymia.</hi>
                  </note> which is a fit remedie for euerie humour that raigneth. But of them we will ſpeake more at large in their perticular Chapters.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Antiſpaſis.</hi>
                  </note> Nowe <hi>Antiſpaſis</hi> (that is) a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uulſion the contrarie way, is a common remedie againſt all theſe kind of tumours, while the fluxe doeth yet ſtronglie preuaile, as in the beginning and encreaſing of the euill: but in the end of the ſtate, and in the declination thereof, while the fluxe nowe remaineth and ſticketh in the member, and the whole bodie is ſufficientlie emptied, the euacuation muſt be attempted and fetched either from the affected part, or from that which is next adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thereunto.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Secundus ſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus.</hi>
                  </note> The ſecond intention contayneth remedies to prouoke ſleepe. vidz. which do mitigate paine, and alſo bind and preuent the fluxe. Morouer it teacheth remedies, which are able to looſen and diſſolue the naturall poores, by the which the affected member is wo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be throughly purged. But the matter of all theſe ſhall be aboundantly deſcribed hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tertius ſcopus</hi>
                  </note> But we will handle the third intention, which is perfited with ſuch things as do euacuate the matter that exciteth the tumour, from the affected place. And that matter is euacuated not only by medicines which do euaporate &amp; diſſolue, but alſo by ſuch as do repell and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe

And therefore in the beginning of theſe phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monous tumors, and other whatſoeuer do deriue their beginning from the influxion of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, we may rather vſe repreſſing medicines, then thoſe which do euaporate: except in certaine caſes, of the which (ſaith Guido) Galene ſeemed to haue appointed foure.<note place="margin">

Let this therfore be a generall rule or canon of art, In the beginning of all tumours, which proceede of the influxion of humours, (thoſe three excepted which were named a little before) one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie pure repreſſiues are to be vſed. But in their increaſing we muſt mingle with theſe repul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiues, ſome of thoſe thinges which do diſſolue and diſcuſſe. But in the ſtate of tumours, yea and ſomewhat before the ſtate, wee muſt commix repreſſiue medicines equallie with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſiue, and when there is declination preſent, or the end of the ſtate, we may lawfully vſe onely reſoluing and releaſing remedies: to conclude, ſo long as the humour doeth yet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, we muſt labour to repell it, and driue it away: but if the fluxe doth ſtill remaine, we muſt ſeeke to digeſt it. But if it dependeth vppon both, (that is to ſay) that partly ſomthing hath alreadie flowed, and cleaueth faſt to the place, and partly ſome thing may yet abound and flow: then it ſhall be lawfull to vſe commixed remedies, (that is) partly thoſe, which can reſolue &amp; vnbind, and partly thoſe which are able to bring backe, and repell.

But their cures, whereby we will finiſh all thoſe inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions whereof we intreated before, according to their diuerſe matter that exciteth the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ſhall be deſcribed and declared in their perticuler Chapters, as by conſequence and order they ſhall followe.</p>

But Apertion is made more ſafely with a knife, then with burning and ſcalding medicines, if nothing do hinder it, and commonly ſuch kind of phlegmonous tumours, being already turned into ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puration, are opened with a penknife. Moreouer Apertion, or the letting out of the matter ought to be done, by reaſon, both of the aboundance of matter there gathered together, and alſo of the affected place. But if any part of the mattered member, ſhall ſeeme to be putrified &amp; rotten, it is needful to cut it of, to the forme or likneſſe of an oliue or mirtle leafe, that it may heale the more eaſily. But Galene commandeth to auoid &amp; eſchew alwayes any great inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, who did heale ſuch kind of mattered tumours, both in the partes about the priuy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, and alſo in the armeholes onely by inciſion (as he vſed chiefly to do) and by medicines that were of force to dry: Now if neede ſometime required to cut of ſomwhat, by reaſon of the plenty not only of matter, but alſo of the corrupted partes, he vſed no greater inciſion the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the breath of a great mirtle leafe. For by wide &amp; large ſections, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the member is brought vnto a ſcarre, beſides that it is made moſt filthie, it alſo becommeth very weake, and vnfit to moue withall.

And in thoſe truely, the lenghtes of them muſt be drawen ouerwart, and not by the ſtraitneſſe or rightneſſe of the legge or body: for when we bend the legge or the arme, the skinne naturally doeth apply it ſelfe with it.

But if a humour doeth flow in the knee, you muſt cut a veine in the elbow either the outward or the middle veine except you meane to ſcarifie the other legge, or breake the veine a ſunder in it, as Galene counſeleth in a certaine place.<note place="margin">

                  </note> Therefore the election of the cutting any veine, and the inuention to turne the humour another way, (which Hippocrates calleth <hi>antiſpaſis</hi>) is manifeſted and declared by the affected parte, and by the place or ſituation of the member that is to be cured, as Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lene 13. and 14. <hi>meth. med.</hi> and in other places, doeth oftentimes teach. But that body, which <hi>phlegmone</hi> occupieth, not onely when it is plethorike and full of humours, but alſo when the greatneſſe of the euil doth exhorte vs to it, (though it be but meanely ſtuffed with humours,) we muſt empty and euacuate by letting of bloud, if we will follow the aduiſe of Galene, who <hi>lib.</hi> 13. <hi>meth. med.</hi> commandeth that, it ſhould be ſo, thus writing.

Whenas inflammation being cauſed through the defluxion of humours, doeth vexe with great paine, you muſt mitigate the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemencie of the ſame without any hurte doing. 2.

Apply to the tumour, a ſponge dipped in ſharpe wine or <hi>poſca,</hi> that ſo you may preuent the paſſage of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the humour that floweth. 5. If theſe thinges ſhall profit, and yet the matter appeareth not any where, you muſt vſe ſoft and gentle emplaiſters, and thoſe eſpecially, which are made as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> remedies againſt fluxe. 6. Amongeſt thoſe thinges, which are of power to drie, and repell the fluxe of bloud without paine, you muſt chooſe the beſt, as is that reſolution with oile of roſes, which it made of the ſtone <hi>chalcitis</hi>: then lay vpon it pure wooll dipped in ſharpe wine. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> 7. But when matter appeareth in the member, you muſt often applie the aforeſaid cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſme, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> or that rather, which is made of barely meale. 8. If the aboundance of thicke mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doeth exceed the medicines ſo that there is no hope of reſolution you muſt make an iſſue for that which yeeldeth not vnto digeſtion in that place eſpecially, where it is higheſt. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> 9. After inciſion, you muſt drie the wound, if paine be not vrgent, and clenſe it and ſcoure it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> without greife. 10. If after inciſion, paine be vehement, you muſt firſt aſſuage it with fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, then with a cataplaſme, ſtraight after with ſome moiſt medicine, or with ſuch a one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> as dryeth not. 11.

In an exquiſite <hi>eryſipelas</hi> make no detraction of bloud. 2. If the bodie be full of choler and the affect be great, purge the bellie downward with the medicine <hi>cholagogon.</hi> 3. If the diſeaſe be little &amp; ſmall and the bodie without choler, vſe no medicine to purge choler, but <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> content your ſelfe with ſome ſharpe clyſter. 4. When you haue purged the whole bodie (as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> you muſt) annoint the affected member in the beginning with medicines that can mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> repreſſe and aboundantly refrigerate, euen to the chaunging of the colour. 5. When <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> you ſee the cholour of the aggreaued member altered, and the heat of <hi>eryſipelas</hi> ſlaked, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the inflammation ceaſed, you muſt paſſe ouer from refrigerating and adſtrictiue medicines <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> before that the member be throughly blew or blacke, vnto their contraries (that is) vnto digeſtiues or diſcuſſiues and drying remeadies. 6. Thoſe <hi>eryſipelata</hi> which are cauſed of vl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and of other manifeſt cauſes you muſt firſt ſcarifie, and afterwarde apply a cataplaſme of barely meale. 7. If <hi>eryſipelas</hi> be not exquiſite or true, but <hi>phlegmonous:</hi> you may let bloud <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> without fearing any thing, eſpecially if bloud do abound in the bodie.</p>

Nowe wee make perfect and we finiſh the two later thinges, that is, the rary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the thicke bodie, and the extenuation of the groſſe vapour, by one and the ſame kinde of medicines, which is by vſinge thoſe remedies which doe profite to the extenuation of the members and by applying thoſe helpes, which can heate either more or leſſe according to the inflation of the afflicted members according to the thickeneſſe or thinneſſe thereof, and according alſo to the groſeneſſe or thinneſſe of the vapours. For according to the difference of theſe things, the power or facultie of thoſe medicines, which are miniſtred, ought to be intended and remitted. The thinne parts therfore, &amp; the vapour or ſpirit which is not verie thick, are but meanely to be dealt withall: but the groſſe members, &amp; that vapour which containeth much thick matter, do require medicines, which may great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly extenuate &amp; heate them.

haſtely at one time without ceaſing: for out minde is to vſe no viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t thing in this our work. And truely in little tumours, that is, in ſmall <hi>ſtrumae,</hi> make but a ſimple inciſion, or diuide them with a ſmall line; but in great abſceſſions cut the skinne to the forme of a myrtle leafe: then thoſe veſſelles which are vncouered (as the veynes and arteries) put them ſoftely and eaſily aſide. After theſe thinges, diſtend and ſtretch out the ſides of the ſection, or the edges of the diuided skinne, with pinſers, or with other ſuch inſtruments, and plucke out the filmes within, either with your fingers, or with ſome other inſtrument appointed for that purpoſe, and ſo by little and little picke out <hi>ſtruma,</hi> where it appeareth bare and vnfolded from the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles. But if <hi>ſtruma</hi> ſhalbe wound about the veſſells, you muſt handle the cure with great attention, leaſt through negligence, there followeth a copious profuſion of bloud. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in diſpatching this cure, drawe one onely ſide of the ſection at once with the pynſers, and ſo by little and little ſeperate it with the poynt of a penknyfe from the other partes ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto adioyned, and when you haue drawen and looſed the connexion on the one ſide, doe the like alſo on the other ſide, and then cut out the whole foundation or ground worke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the ſinowes and veſſelles lying vnderneath. But in thoſe <hi>ſtrumae,</hi> which do chaunce about the armeholes, and about the pryuie members, you muſt make an ouerthwart inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by reaſon of the doubling of the skinne. Moreouer in that ſection, which is made in <hi>ſtrumae</hi> that poſſeſſe the necke, you muſt haue a ſingular care, leaſt either the arteries, which they call <hi>carotides,</hi> or the quiuering ſinowes be touched and hurte. But if by the cutting of any veſſell when you make inciſion, the profuſion of bloude doth delaie and hinder your worke, either take vp the veſſell with a ſmall corde, or (if it be not verie great) cutte it quite of (as Paulus counſelleth) or elſe, (if it burſteth not out with great violence) applie ſuch remedies, as are appoynted to ſtench the bloud. Afterward returne againe vnto your enterpryſed labour. Therefore, when the foundation of <hi>ſtruma</hi> is brought into a narrowe roome, cutte it cleane of, cunninglie and handeſomlie, and then put in the forefinger, and ſearche the place diligentlie, wheather there be any other <hi>ſtrumae</hi> thereunto adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or not, which, (if there be anie founde) you muſt alſo drawe forth after that manner, which we haue before expreſſed.

But in enterpriſing the ſame, we muſt be verie attentiue &amp; warie (as wee haue ſaide before of <hi>ſtrumae</hi>) that we raſhly hurt not and teare in peeces the filme or tunicle, whereupon the humour, which was contained therein, guſhing out plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifullie, doeth both hinder our operation, and ſome portion thereof alſo remaineth ſtill behinde.

It is alſo verie vnpleaſaunt vnto all creatures liuing, ſo that neither mice nor flies will taſt thereof. It ſheweth likewiſe, like vnto aboundaunce of ſalt, wherein no liuing thing can vpholde his life, as the ſea which is ſayed to be dead.

For truely this humour (ſayth Galene) when it waxeth vehementlie hoate, either becauſe of the corruption thereof, or becauſe of a burning feuer, it cauſeth melancholie:<note place="margin">

The ſecond <hi>ſpecies</hi> or difference of vnnaturall melancholie is that,<note place="margin">

But the flyes alſo doe abhorre it, as in a trewe melancholie. If bloud alſo or fleume ſhall be vehementlie heated in the bodie, and burnt, there is alſo cauſed a melancholike humour, which Auicene becauſe of the aduſtion tearmed to be vnnaturall. But theſe two laſt kindes, which doe come of the aduſtion of bloud and fleume, Auicene hath thought to be verie milde and gentle, yet Galene writeth, that that kind of melancholie, which is ingendred of burnt choler, is a great deale more daungerous then that which hath his generation of groſſe bloud,<note place="margin">

But the thicker and the blacker the bloud is whereof cancre proceedeth the more daungerous will the diſeaſe be. Now when cancre is full growen, as they ſay, and inueterate, it admitteth not any cure, except it be plucked vp by the rootes either by ſectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or by aduſtion: but thoſe cancres, which haue their conſtitution in the inward partes of the bodie, doe not deſire any ſuch kinde of cure, as that auncient Hippocrates ſimplie the prince of Phyſitions hath taught vs very well in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoriſme following:<note place="margin">

Thoſe cancres therefore are onely curable which doe ſticke in the outward part of the bodie, and which are exulcerate, and doe ſo wearie the ſicke, that they willingly deſire the diligence of the chyrurgian: and theſe tumours alſo do conſiſt in thoſe partes, which a man may cut and ſeare of hard by the rootes.

Therefore to cure theſe cancres, but yet beginning, you muſt vſe medicines of a meane &amp; moderate ſtrength, which neither their imbecillitie can be vanquiſhed, nor for the vehemencie can mightily thicken the bloud.

But if you intende to ſeare of the rootes of this euill, yet truely you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe this neither without hurting of the next partes, eſpecially if you make exuſtion neere vnto the principall members. Great cancres therefore, and thoſe which are inue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate, muſt neither raſhly be burned with any inſtrument, nor cutte of with a penknife, but rather handled gently and mildly (as we haue ſaide before.) For many men not by the applying of any forcible or vehement medicines to take away this euill, but by the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miniſtring of eaſie and gentle remedies, which can as it were pleaſe or delight, haue ſo hindred theſe tumours, that they coulde not attaine vnto any perfect age or rypeneſſe.

Imprimis in a canker which is but newly begone, and which conſiſteth of noe verie thicke humour, nor cauſeth the veynes to ſwell greatly: purge out the melancholicke humour which cauſeth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> this euill vniuerſally throughout the whole bodie. 2. If age and ſtrength doth ſuffer it, cut a veine in the elbow, and draw out as much bloud as neede requireth. 3. Afterward myni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> to the ſicke ſuch medicines as can purge melancholie downewarde: in the beginning <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> let them be gentle and eaſie, but afterwarde ſomewhat vehement increaſing their force by little and little. 4.

In the meane time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point vnto the ſicke a thinne diet, which can engender good iuyce, and cauſe no melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholike <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> bloud. 6. If you cannot auoyde it, but that a groſſe and melancholious humour be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> gathered togeather in the veynes: you muſt euacuate the ſame by turnes, both with ſimple and compound medicines. But theſe former Aphoriſmes doe pertaine vnto the Phyſition: nowe we will declare the dutie of the Chyrurgian. 7. applie vnto the affected member bothe before purging, and in the verie time of purging, ſuch medicines as can repell, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> driue backe: but when the bodie is vniuerſally purged, then vſe digeſtiue remedies, but let them be ſuch as are of a moderate ſtrength and of a gentle nature. 8.

man compound togeather Syrupe of wormewoode and ſtechados being taken in euen portion or quantitie, there would come thereof a Syrupe good for the ſtomach, becauſe of the wormewoode, and good for the heade becauſe of the ſtechados. A Syrupe is good &amp; profitable to digeſt humours before a purgation, that they may the eaſier and better obey the purgation. Therefore they are vſed of many Phyſitions to be giuen before medicines, although we haue not read, that olde practiſers did obſerue it, but they did commit the digeſtion of humours wholy to nature. Looke the comment. <hi>Aphoriſm.</hi> 9. lib. 2. when anie man will purge the bodie, it behoueth to make it flowing. Truely Hippocrates would doe thus, ſaying, that the concoct and digeſt matter ought to be healed and moued, and not the crude and rawe matter. And Galene ad Glauconem. lib. 1. ſpeaking of the cure of <hi>Tertiana notha,</hi> woulde not haue worme woode to be giuen till the ſeuenth daie. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it doth appeare for a truth, that ſyrupes ought rather to be giuen for the humours lefte after a purgation, then for their digeſtion and coction. But many doe obſerue and vſe, that humours being groſſe, clammie, and viſcous, may by ſyrupes that do attenuate, cutte and deuide, be preparate and made eaſie to auoyding and purging they call this dige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of humours.
