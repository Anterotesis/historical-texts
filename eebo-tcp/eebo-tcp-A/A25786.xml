            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The Acts of Parliament where upon the same is founded, are otherwise repeated than they bear for. 1.

               <hi>Item.</hi> In the next Parl. of the proposition of the Dittay founded upon the 43. Act. 2 Parl. <hi>Iac.</hi> 1. and the 134. Act of the 8. Parl. and 10 Act. 10. Parl. and the 205. Act. 14. Parl. of King <hi>Iac.</hi> 6. None of these Acts are repeated as they bear, but confounded, both as to the crimes and pains therein contained, to a very far different sense (as is humbly conceived) from that which the said acts severally propose. Transferring the pains of the said several acts and crimes therein contained from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as may appear by what follows, for the first of these Acts, being the 43. Act Parl. 2 <hi>Iac.</hi> 1. Is only of lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Makers and Tellers of them which may engender strife between the King and his people, and the pain of the Act is tinsel of life and goods to the King, as is clear both by the title and body of the act. The second act, <hi>viz.</hi> the 134 act. 8. Parl. K. <hi>Iac.</hi> 6. is also the same crime, <hi>viz.</hi> against those that utter false, slanderous and untrue speeches, to the disdain, reproach or contempt of his Majesty, his councel or proceedings, or to the dishonour of his Majesties parents and progenitors: adding also those meddle in the affairs of his Majesty, and his Estates, and the pain is the pain contained in the acts of Parliament made against Leasing Makers and the Tellers of them. The 3. is the 10. Act. 10. Parl K. <hi>Iac.</hi> 6. Is against th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

These that hears the said words leasings, and doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend and reveal the Authors thereof, shall incur the like punishment with the principal offenders, and yet leasing

And only speaking to the dishonour of his Majesty, Parents and Progenitors, and medling with the affairs of his Highness Estate is repeated out of the said Act 134. and joyned to the crime contained in the said Acts 10. Parl. 10. <hi>Iac.</hi> 6. and to both the pains added of loosing life, lands and goods, whereas the pain of the said act. 10. is only of death; and the pain of the said 134. Parl. 8. <hi>Iac.</hi> 6. Is only the pain contained in the Acts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst leasing Makers which in the said 43 act Parl. 2. <hi>Iac.</hi> 1. Is only the loss of life and goods and not of life, lands and goods, but all annerly the Escheates, of goods move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, as may appear, First, Because whenever the pain of tinsel, of life and goods is found either in the Acts of Parliament or old Lawes, goods are understood moveable, as is clear from the crimes that are ordained to be so pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, as Manslaughter. Be the 42. stat. <hi>Robert</hi> 3. Is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited under the pain of tinsel of life and goods, where <hi>Skein</hi> explains, that these goods are to be understood of Moveables. And be the Act 90. Parl. 6. <hi>Iac.</hi> 1. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of him who is fugitive for slaughter, is forbidden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pain of tinsell of life and goods (Where <hi>Skein</hi> expounds goods to be goods moveable, in his Tractar of Crimes tit. 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. Parl. 4.) And so it is clear in the other acts of Parliament that their whole pains are distinct, <hi>viz.</hi> Tinsel of life and goods alike, is only extended to moveables; and tinsel of life, lands and goods, which lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter pain in the stile of our acts of Parliament is commonly thus expressed: That he who incurs it, shall die and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit life, lands and goods, as the 31. Act, Parl. 7. <hi>Iac.</hi> 2, <hi>&amp; passim alibi</hi> forfeiture properly relating to lands; and in the common signification of our said goods to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of goods moveable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secundo.</hi> More specially it may appear, that the pain of the said 43. act. Parl. 2. <hi>Iac.</hi> 1. given to the said 134. act
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:65289:6"/>
Parl. 8. <hi>Iac.</hi> 6. relates in the pain thereof, is only the pain of escheat of Moveables, because the pain of forfeiting of life, lands and goods, is the proper pain of the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If such uncertain libel were admitted the defender be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the obscurity and uncertainty of the libell should be prejudged of an certain defence he could make against the relevancy of the same because the relevancy of it consists in the subsumption of the facts and crimes libelled under some certain law, which being condescended on be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct subsumption under each law of the crimes that were libelled properly to fall under the same. The defender would alledge why such crimes cannot be subsumed revelant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly under such laws and acts which the otherwise cannot do in such multiplicity both of different acts and crimes as are libeled in this duty.

foresaid, yet such firme relyance hath he of his Majesty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting in his gracious clemency) which does in his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all heart so much abound) That albeit his Majesty by his Proclamation, <hi>Dadet</hi> the 12.

The defender in all humility conceiving that it is no wayes to be supposed that his gracious Majesty did therebey intend to rip up or revive, or to institute any new tryall of old offences forgotten and forgiven as said is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially, seeing it is not to be supposed that the bowells of his mercyes should be so straitned to this his ancient Kingdome, to which he has upon all occasions given so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny signall and recent testimonies of his superabundant fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour then they are, and have been to his Subjects of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dominions, to whom according to his Majesties decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, he hath granted a full and free pardon, from which few, and these only the unpardonable murderers of his royal father are excluded; for whom, or any guilty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, no punishment can be sufficient, and therefore the defender in all humility conceives the said articles, though libelled, are not to be insisted on.</p>
            <p>The solemnity of the oaths both of Covenant and League, will be as the defender hopes, pregnant presumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to put and end all controversie, anent the sincerity of his (as of the Church and Kingdome) their loyal inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the maintenance of the person and authority of our dread Soveraign whereunto they were thereby so reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously ingaged, and the constant tenor of his acting still by vertue of publick Orders and Warrants of Parliament, and their commit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

these unnatural civill discords as he did witnesse by his incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to unaccommodation with <hi>Montross</hi> in the year 1645. mentioned after in answer to the tenth article, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit fully agreed to betwixt him and the defender, yet he could not obtain the commitees approbation thereof, which is in evidence, that the defender had not the chief sway of affaires and was alwayes inclinable to peace (religion being secured) like as the carrying on the ingagement in the year 1648. though the defender differed in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as to the way and manner upon the grounds and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, thereafter exprest in answer to the ninth Articles) does clearly evince that he had not the chief sway in publict actings, and what power and interest he had in the year 1649. he did faithfully according to his bond duty improve the same for removing these differences betwixt his Majesty and his subjects, wherein he was pationately earnest as shall be made appear in answer to the said tenth article and after his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties hom-coming and during his being in this Kingdom, and thereafter till the enemy had fully prevailed and that by his articles of agreement he was there prisoner he faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully served his majesty, and even during his Majestyes ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, did alwayes and still shall return loyall duty and good affection to his person, government and poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

D. ad L. libellorum ff. de Accusatione,</hi> because amongst o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reasons, <hi>diversitas loci varia argueret facinora,</hi> saith <hi>Battand: Reg. 6. prax. cum post angel,</hi> &amp;c. But so it is, there is no moneth condescended on when the defender should have spoken these words, and therefore the dittay in this article is inept. 2. There is no particular act of Parliament in the act libellit upon in the proposition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descendit, on which is contravened by the words libellit, therefore the libel in this article of the subsumption, is general and obscure; and till the particular Law contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d be condescendit, one can receive no answer. 3. The speaches as they are libellit, falls not under the compass of the acts libellit on in the proposition of the lybel, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any of the pains therein contained, because they are but libellit, as the narration of the opinion of others, which is not relevant to infer so much, that the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor is of the same opinion, except it were also libellit that he did declare his homologation, and that he was of the same judgement, which neither is, nor can be libellit far les, then is it relevant to infer a crime, and so high a crime as Treason; for suppone the defender had said, That they are very learned both Divines and Lawyers, whose opinion it is, that the Pope is the head of the Church, and that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:65289:11"/>
he has power to dispense with the article of faith, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Kings (a horrid opinion)<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that it is their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion also we may merit heaven by good works, and that all Hugonites or Protestants are damnable here<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Restituit papa salus deponit, &amp;c. articulus solvit.</p>
            <p>And had said to Mr. <hi>John Stewart</hi> thereupon, Mr. <hi>John</hi> you understand Latin, albeit these opinions of these Divines and Lawyers be exec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ably Heretick, yet no body will say, that the defenders relation of him, would have inferred him to have been guilty of the same; No more in our case can the relation libellit infer him to have been of that opinion with these Divines and Lawyers, or in any way thereby to have contravened any act of Parliament li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled. 2. The foresaid opinion is libellit only to have been related <hi>in abstracto,</hi> (nothing of our Kings Majesty who then was) And whereas it is libellit, that it appears the sence and meaning thereof appeared to have been of the then Kings Majesty, in so far, as the defender subjoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Mr. <hi>Iohn Stewart,</hi> the words aforesaid, that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood latin. 1. The libel in this part is ambiguous for this may be interpret, either that it was the meaning of the opinion of these Divines which he related, (this seems to be most consonant to the words) or els that his own meaning was, That it was the judgement that the then Kings Majesty our Soveraign might be so dealt with, as is libelled in the latter part of his article, and so the Article in this part thereof is ambiguous and inept, and there ought to be no process thereupon. <hi>Nam Libèllus (in criminali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus praesertim) nihil ambiguitatis vel obscuritatis continere debet per cap. Constitut. 6. extr. derig. don. Bot. 3.</hi> If it be understood in the former sence, it is but still relative of the opinion others; and if in this latter sence, to wit,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:65289:12"/>
that it was his own judgement, the presumption libelled of what he spake to Mr. <hi>Iohn Stewart,</hi> is no way relevant to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it. 1. Because they held a more obvious meaning, <hi>viz.</hi> That it might have been the opinion of these Divines and Lawyers was related in latin, and indeed <hi>Grotius</hi> and <hi>Berclaius,</hi> who write of that Subject, are both in latin, and that he had subjoyned to Mr. <hi>Iohn Stewart,</hi> Mr. <hi>Iohn</hi> ye understand latin. 2. That such opinions being rather the fancy of notional Schoolmen, (otherwise not unlearned in their own art) or of such as are Doctors notionals in the Law, (if there be any of such opinions) rather then of solid juriscon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ult, who for most do not so much as move these questions not to be moved. 3. If any such words had been spoken to Mr. <hi>Iohn Stewart,</hi> They might have had this more proverbial sense. Some Lawyers and Divines are of that opinion, but the subtilty of these questions or opinions is latin to me, that is, I understand it not, as we say commonly of things we understand not, <hi>It is latin to me.</hi> But Mr. <hi>Iohn</hi> ye are a Schollar, and ye understand it. Now it is a rule in Law, that where the meaning is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or obscure, that which is the most favourable sence should be followed. <hi>L. 9. ff. de reg. juris and Matheus de afflictis decisione 265. n. 68. 69. &amp; decis. 307. n. 15.</hi> and when these words are ambiguous, The declaration of him who uttered them should be acquiessed unto; <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the defender is ready to declare, that if ever he had spoken such words, he was very far from any such mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as is libelled against him. Nor 4. is it any way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumable that any rational man, who had the honour to know his late Majesty, could have made application of any of these three causes to so worthy and illustrious a Prince, seeing the said <hi>Grotius, Berclay,</hi> and others that writs upon that subject, acknowledges yea it is obvious to common sense, that hardly can they fall out in the worst of Princes, if he be but <hi>compos mentis</hi>: and as to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption that follows, that the defender meaned by the late Kings Majesty, because the condition wherein the kingdom was for the time. 1.

            <p>As to that part of the article annent the burning of the house of <hi>Forther</hi> beside the exceptions against both the points thereof alledgit before in the beginning, it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levant to say that the defender seised there upon to infer any crime except it were libelled he seised by force, for he might have entred <hi>in vacuam possessionem. 2 Non relevant</hi> to libell that those under him did seise thereupon or raise fire therein, except it were libelled that the defender had given expresse order or wanrrand to raise that wilfull fire: who as he gave not order therefore, so he was not present not near the place, not knew any thing thereof till after the house was burnt &amp; <hi>noxia caput sequitur.</hi> 3.

Taking of the house of <hi>Towart</hi> and <hi>Escog,</hi> is not subsumed upon any of the acts of Parliament lybelled, there being none of them anent the taking in of houses belonging to the leiges, and so is not relevant to infer any of the crimes contained therein. 6.

            <p n="7">7. The defender adhering to their defences, and craving that they being against the relevancy be first discust, repeats his former answer founded upon his commission of Leiutennendry therein mentioned, for they who are designed <hi>Lawmont</hi> and <hi>Escoges</hi> friends, were the <hi>Mac Donalds,</hi> or their Adherents and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessories (as is noture, and the defender if need shall be, offers to prove it) whom by the foresaid Commission he had power to prosecute with fire and sword, with dispensation of slaughter, and raisings of fire in manner at length contained in the Commission, which amongst the other acts of Parl. 1644. is ratified by his Majesty in his Treaty at <hi>Breda,</hi> as is alledged in the said answer which is holden herein repeated, and therefore the defender ought to be assoiled from this article, and truly what cruelty was exercised, was by the Lord of <hi>Lawmont</hi> himself against the Heretors and other inhabitants in the Shrievdome of <hi>Argyl,</hi> for the which upon a supplication given into the Kings Majesty and Committee of Estates at <hi>Sterling</hi> in <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust</hi> 1651.

            <p>It is alledged against the seventh article, That 1. The first part thereof (anent the men alledged mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered at <hi>Lockhead</hi> and <hi>Dinnavertie</hi>) is no wayes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levant, not only in respect that the particular moneth and dayes whereupon the same should have been done, are not condescended upon, but also in respect there is not one particular person by name and surname whereby he might be known condescended upon, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst whom the deeds libelled should have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, without the which this part of the article can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be sustained as relevant, it being contrary to all Law and practise, that murther in the general without nameing the persons murdered should be sustained as relevant Dittay against any. 2. The slaughter alledge a

It is alledged, That the defender cannot be charged with any of the deeds ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled in the said first part of the article (though they were true and relevantly lybelled, as they are not) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the expedition made against the rebels in <hi>Kintyre</hi> in the year labelled, was by <hi>David Lesley,</hi> and these under his command, against such, who contrary to his Majesties order sent to them at that time, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to lay downe armes, and contrary to their own engagements, not to joyn with <hi>Ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, Mac Donald</hi> did notwithstanding continue in armes and rebelliously (as was then declared by the Estates of Parliament) resisted <hi>David Leslie</hi> in the execution of his said Commission against them, who therefore after defeating of them in the field, took them out of the said houses of <hi>Lockhead</hi> and <hi>Dunnavertie</hi> without any capitulation, and disposed of them as the Counsel of Warre then present with him thought fit (which is noture, and the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der offers to prove, if need be) for which, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his services, the said <hi>David Lesly</hi> got the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments approbation in <hi>anno</hi> 1648. as the said ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probition and exoneration bears, which will clearly prove any thing that is herein alledged, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the defender, nor any in his company at that time cannot be charged with any deeds lybelled in the first part of this article, but ought to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soiled therefra. 4. The defender repeats his third defence made to the fifth article founded upon his Commission of Leivtennendry, the persons menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:65289:20"/>
in this article against whom the deeds are lybelled, to have been committed, having been the Mac. <hi>Donalds</hi> or the Adherents and Accessories which is noture, (and the defender offers to prove, if need be) to prosecute whom he had the Commission containing dispensation, and which was ratified in manner men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the said answer, like as he repeats the 4 &amp; 5 answer made to the said article, in respect whereof he ought to be assoilied therefra.</p>
            <p>It is alledged against the 2, 3 and 4 members of this 7 ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, that they are no wayes subsumed, nor cannot be subsumed under any of the acts of Parliament ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled, and therefore the dittay herein is inept, and the defender ought to be assoiled therefra, (and yet in point of fact they are but meer Calumnies) As to the second part (anent the said old man and his son) it is no wayes relevant, not condescending on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons names, and therefore can receive no other answer, but that it is a meer fiction to make the defender more odious, who ingenuously professes, that he never heard of such a thing, till he saw it in the libel. The third part of this article hath no better ground than the second, and the defender desires, that for clearing his innocency of the fact lybelled therein (anent the sending of two hundred men from <hi>Ila</hi> to starve in <hi>Iura</hi>) that the Gentlemen in the said Islles may be examined upon the truth of the matter. It is alledged that the fourth part of this article, anent <hi>Coil Kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toch.</hi>

            <p n="7">
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:65289:20"/>7. Is of the same nature with the former two, and therefore the simple relation of the truth is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to refute the falshood thereof, which is short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Coil Kittoch</hi> was not brought to <hi>Leith</hi> either by order of the Committee of Estates or Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, but being taken prisoner in <hi>Ila</hi> by the forces under the command of <hi>David Lesly,</hi> and delivered to the defender, the defender put him aboard in Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Browns</hi> ship who undertook to deliver him at Dunstaffnage. But Captain Brown finding the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of a fair wind to Leith, to which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and not willing to lose the same, did not go to <hi>Dunstaffnag,</hi> but came streight to <hi>Leith</hi> Road, and immediately gave the defender notice, that he had his prisoner aboard, whom therefore the defender received from him, and sent him to <hi>Dunstaffnage</hi>: and the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der desires that Captain <hi>Brown</hi> who lives at <hi>Weymes,</hi> may be examined upon the truth of this matter, by whom he offers to prove this, if need were.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is libelled that <hi>Coil Kittoch</hi> was hanged it is true, but it is also true that he was condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to die in a justice or Liestenant court judicially which is noture. And the defender offers to prove, if need shall be, so that this can be a ground of no crime nor ditty what somever, but however the defender ought to be assoiled therefra.</p>
            <p n="8">8.

            <p n="13">13. The cause of the first member of the said eight Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, anent the pretended act of Parliament, as is libelled, for abandoning and leaving his Majestie to the disposal and mercy of his enemies, the Sectarian Army, does debond from the Acts of Parliament (as clearly appears) and can be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed on under none of the Acts of Parliament libelled: For if the tenth Act of Parliament, 1647. be understood and meaned, as the Act libelled (that being an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament) the Defender humbly alledges, That an Act of an acknowledged lawful Parliament, should be made a crime of accession, whereunto a Member of Parliament shall be indicted (especially for so high a crime as Treason) is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ground of Law of practice, and is hoped, the honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Parliament will no ways sustain it; and therefore, that he needs say no more now in confirmation hereof.</p>

injury to be done to the same (as indeed it was horrid to think that any on earth should have done) or prejudice to His Majesties Posterity: But thereafter it is clear from the fourth and seventh Acts of the Parliament, 1648. that the Sectarian Army disobeyed, and threatened the Houses of Parliament, imprisoned and banished faithful Members, and by a sudden surprizing, violently seized upon the Person of the Kings Majestie, carried Him from His House at <hi>Homeby,</hi> against His own will, and declared Resolutions of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and kept him under their guards, till at length, <hi>by their Power and Prevalency.</hi> He was committed, and kept close Prisoner at the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> this being the true case out of the express words of the Acts before cited.</p>
            <p>As to that Declaration, Act. 10. Parl. 1647. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender alledges, 1. The Act bears express, That it was to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie His Majesties own desire. 2. That it is homologat and approven by the Parliament, 1648. in so far, as by their fourth Act, institulate, <hi>Anext their Resolutions concerning the breaches of Covenant and Treaties betwixt the Kingdom of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>and</hi> England, and demands for reparation thereof; findes the violent seising on his Sacred Majesties Person, and taking Him away from <hi>Homeby</hi>-house (as appears by Act 7.) by that Army, against the resolutions of both King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, a breach: And amongst the Reparations, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire expresly, that conform to the former desires of this Kingdom, the Kings Majestie may come with Honour, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Safety to some of his Houses in or near <hi>London,</hi> that the Parliaments of both Kingdoms may make applications to him. And in their seventh Act, intituled, <hi>A Declaration of the Parliament of</hi> Scotland, <hi>to all His Majesties good Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this Kingdom, concerning their resolutions for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, King and Kingdom,</hi> &amp;c.

His Majesties good, and Peace of these Kingdoms</hi>; whereof this is one, <hi>That conform to the former desires of this Kingdom, The Kings Majestie may come with Honor, Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Safety to some of His Houses in or near</hi> London; and declares, that thereafter they will endeavour it; and Act 8. in their desires to both Houses Parliament in <hi>England,</hi> the same desire is repeated, <hi>Conform to the former desires of this Kingdom.</hi> By all which it is clear, That the seizing upon His Sacred Majesties Person, was the violent deed of that wicked-Army, done with a violent surprisal, against the declared resolutions of both Kingdoms. And that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties coming to some of His Houses in or about <hi>London,</hi> where both Kingdoms might make applications to Him, conform to His Kingdoms desire (which is that wherein the the Estates declares their concurrence with His Majestie, and both Houses of Parliament in <hi>Englands</hi> desire in the said tenth Act) is approven as a just and necessary desire for His Majestie, and accordingly enacted among that Parliament, 1648. their desires to the said Houses, and declare it should be endeavoured, if refused, so highly is it approven by the said Parliament. In respect whereof, specially of the standing Acts of Parliaments, 1648. the Defender humbly craves, That albeit the Article was relievantly, distinctly, and clearly libelled and subsumed on some of the Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in the Proposition condescended on (as he humbly conceives is not) yet he ought to be assolized there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from.</p>
            <p>And for further clearing what was the ground and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of that Act, and the reasons inducing the Defender and the Parliament at that time to go along therein, and how little ground there is for challenging him thereon, it would be considered, That when the late King came to the Army before <hi>Newcastle,</hi> the Defender was in <hi>Ireland,</hi> by Commission from the Parliament, 1646. and that His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Declarations anent the grounds of His resolution in coming to the Scots, was sent both to the Committee of Estates in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and to the Parliament of <hi>England</hi>; so
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:65289:24"/>
that the same being printed before the Defender came to <hi>Newcastle,</hi> he neither did not could know any other ground of his coming, nor what was contained in His Declaration, <hi>viz.</hi> His gracious Resolution to comply with His Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in both Nations, and those entrusted by them in every thing, for setling of truth and peace; and that he would totally commit himself to their counsels and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vises. Upon which terms, both the Committee of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Officers of the Army, declared to His Majestie, and to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> that they received him: And all this before the Defender came from <hi>Ireland</hi> to <hi>Newcastle</hi>; from whence. His Majestie sent him with Instructions to the Commissioners at <hi>London</hi> (of which Commissioners the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender was one also) to hasten the Propositions; and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately commanded the Defenders, to take the advice of the Duke of <hi>Richmond,</hi> and Marqueis of <hi>Hertford,</hi> anent what might concern His Majestie; and particularly, if it was fit, that the Scots Army should declare for His Majestie; whose judgement and opinion was (which they conjured him to tell his Majestie) that such a course was the onely way at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to mine his Majestie, for that he himself knew, That neither the Nobility or Gentry of <hi>England,</hi> who attended him at <hi>Oxford,</hi> wished him to prevail over his Parliament by the sword; and much less, would they indure the Scots Army to do it, and that it would make all <hi>England</hi> as one man against him; And that it was their earnest request to His Majestie, by any means to give way to the Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Which advice he not onely faithfully told to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie at <hi>Newscastle,</hi> and many others there, and to our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soveraign who now is, when he was in <hi>Scotland</hi>; but also being in the Tower, he intreated the Lieutenant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to propose for him, that the Marquess of <hi>Hertford</hi> who was then alive, might be examined in this matter; which was put off from time to time, because of His Majesties great affairs. And as it is most certain, that as neither Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent nor Sectary was able to carry one vote in the House at that time, so it is notior, that they who tendred His

No ways acknowledging the relievancy of the subsump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion herein, upon any of the Acts of the Proposition; till the same be clearly condescended on, and craving the same may be first done, Oppones the Act of Parliament, and the truth is while the Defendor was at <hi>London</hi> there was nothing spoken at all by him of leaving his Majesty in <hi>England</hi> except what he was expresly commanded by his Majesty to speak to <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> and <hi>Hertford</hi> as aforesaid.</p>
            <p>To the third Member of the eighth Article, bearing, <hi>That in a joynt Committee of both Kingdoms, where the English questioned whether the Scots Army would concur with them in their said Treason and Treachery; the Defendor after many arguments used in their favour, earnestly requested them to have patience for a little time, and that it would appear how far they intended to concur: And that within few days thereafter there was a Declaration and Vindication emitted in name of the said Army, holding forth That in case his Majesty did not condescend to all the desires of both Kingdoms, which were no less then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vesting himself of all Regal Power, Civil, Ecclesiastical and Military, they would deliver him up, which immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the receit of Two hundred thousand pounds the Defendor and they did.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is Answered, That adhering to the former defences anent the subsumption, and repeating it here, This mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber although it were rightly subsumed (as it is not) is most irreleivant and general in time, place, person and speeches, mention being made of many arguments, and never one produced, and of a Question and Answer, out of which (even as libelled) Treason cannot be inferred, <hi>viz. That the Defendor requested them to have patience a while, and it would appear how far the Army intended to concur; but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in few days after the Army declared themselves in manner as aforesaid.</hi> Seeing these alledged words of the Defendor, as they are indefinite and general, so the most they could infer is, <hi>That in a short time it would appear whether the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my would concur or not</hi>; and what can from thence be infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:65289:25"/>
as to any thing the Army did; if they have outshot their duty, as it was in regard of him, with the speaking of these words, a future contingent wherein the Defendor had no causualty, so they must answer for themselves, and not the Defendor.</p>
            <p>And for ought he knows there was never any such Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration emitted, neither should there be any captions use made of words, if there had been any such words spoken, as there was never, especially to infer his Treason, for that <hi>Lubricum linguae,</hi> is oftner a frailty then a fault; and that by all Doctors of both Laws it is constantly held that <hi>verba debent intelligi ne sonent in delictum.</hi> And that <hi>in dubio</hi> they should be interpreted <hi>a proferenti.</hi> And therefore no ways acknowleding the words and deeds libelled, except in so far as concerns the Defendor his vote to the Declaration, and as the circumstance libelled, That <hi>the delivery of his Majesty was immediately after the payment of 200000 l,</hi> it is clear that there was no respect to that money in what was done there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, by the Act of 7. Parl. 1648. wherein the Estates there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, <hi>That money was never the cause nor motive of any of our undertaking and resolutions, whatever enemies had falsly sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested of that kind.</hi> And lastlly, adhering to his former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences oppones to this whole Article the Treaty at <hi>Breda,</hi> and the Acts of Parliament of Oblivion and Ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>As to the Ninth Article, and whole first member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, bearing, <hi>That the Defendor opposed the proceedings of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, 1648 by arguing, voting, and after the resolutions of Parliament were past in an Act, in protesting against the same.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is alledged for the Defendor, 1. It is not condescen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under which of the Acts of Parliament libelled on in the proposition, this Article is subsumed, and therefore the libel as to that member of the Article, for arguing, voting and protesting, is inept, and the Defendor hath just reason in such an incertitude to deny it that can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leivantly
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:65289:26"/>
subsumed on any of the said Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Arguing and voting is no ways releivant to infer the conclusion of the Ditray, because by Divine law, Law of Nations, Statutes and practices of this Kingdom, <hi>in delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rando,</hi> a Member of Parliament or other Councel should give advice or suffrage according to his perswasion of the good or ill of the subject debated on, and under considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein if his reason cannot bring him up, nor his conscience admit him the length of others in such publick Counsels; he ought to have charity for the one and excuse for the other.</p>
            <p>Like as by the 5. Act Parl. 2. K. <hi>Charls</hi> the First, It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly statute <hi>That every member of Parliament shall faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and freely speak, answer and express themselves upon it and every thing which is propounded in so far as they think in their conscience may conduce to the glory of God, the peace of the Church and State, and employ their best endeavours to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the same.</hi> Under which oath (read in the audience of the late King, and by him approven in the Parliament 1641.) the Defendor, as a Peer of that Parliament in <hi>anno</hi> 1648. was solemnly tied to the Dictates of his Reason and prescripts of his Conscience, and cannot be called in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion as a member, having freedom therein: and conform thereto, is the oath of this present Parliament, bearing that every member shall faithfully and freely according to their best judgement give their advice and vote in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>To the second part of the first member of the said Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanent the Defendor <hi>his protesting and dissenting from the said Act,</hi> 1648.</p>
            <p>It is alledged for the Defendor, The Protestation not produced, as it ought to be, whereby it will appear that if any was, the same was before the Act of Parliament past, and that they did only proteste and enter their dissent against proceeding to the determination of the question then
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:65289:26"/>
in hand which evinces the same to have been before the Act was made. Like as the Defender offers himself to prove by the Members of Parliament then present, That being asked if they would renew the Protestation after the Act, they shunned to do the same, the Act being now past.</p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>Absolvitor</hi> (Though the same were produced) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is offered to be proven, That the same was ratified In the fourth Act Parl. 2. Sess. 2. <hi>Cha.</hi> 2. which was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at the Treaty at <hi>Breda,</hi> and confirmed at <hi>Perch</hi> and <hi>Sterling,</hi> as is said. But for the honorable Parliament, their more full clearing anent the Defenders carriage in the said particular, It is offered to be proven, if need be is, That the Defender (before the Commissioners return from the said Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> in the said year) when he heard that His Majestie had satisfied his peoples desires concerning Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in presence of divers persons of honour, he exprest himself passionately earnest to engage for his Majesties free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Like as the only difference of the opinion anent the Engagement was in the manner the grounds of these that were dissatisfied, being as they are exprest in the said Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, <hi>viz. That the Parliament should not proceed till the Commission of the Church were consulted and aiding also</hi> (which is not therein exprest) <hi>till advertisement and three months warning were given, conform to the large Treaty; until all means of peace had been first essayed, and while first the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness and necessity of that war should be found by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> conform to the 7. Act thereof. And it is humbly conceived that many in this present Parliament do remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how unanimous all were that His Majesty should be brought out of the hands of the Sectaries, to some of His Houses in or about <hi>London.</hi> And all they differed in was, That the Church should be consulted anent the securing of Religion, all means of peace should first been essayed, and warning given in manner aforesaid, conform to the large Treaty, the breach whereof was made one of the grounds of that Declaration, Act 7. And it cannot be refuted but
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65289:27"/>
that at several meetings the dissenters debated the dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousness of of that War (especially if the Army should be defeated) from the sad consequences that might thereupon ensue to King, Kingdom and Religion, as immediately, thereafter fell out. Whereas had the Nation been intire and whole in their power and force that Army of Sectaries in probability would not have dared to have attempted those matters which afterwards they did; so that the case being truly stated there will appear no malice against his Majesties Person, Authority, and Restitution thereof, but an unclearness to enter into a War of such danger and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, and the respect they had to the security of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion (as all then prosessed) according to the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</p>
            <p>To the second member of the Ninth Article, whereby it is alleadged, <hi>That in contempt of the authority of that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and against the preservation of his Majesties person and Authority; that the Defender convocated an Army of rebellius Subjects, and therewith committed divers and sundry outrages, slaughters and vastations upon the persons and estates of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Subjects, invaded Cities and Castles, seised upon Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeens; Arms and Ammunition, and called in an Army of Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to his assistance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is answered, 1. That the same is not relievantly sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed upon any act of the proposition; at least till the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate condescend upon which Act thereof the same is founded, the defendor is not bound to make answer.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Defendor denies that he did convocate these Forces, or gave counsel or command therefore; and as to his being with them he must be assolied.</p>

the year of God, 1640. to the year 1648. (wherein the Generality and Representatives, both Civil and Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick in the Kingdom concurred) are charged upon the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender as his particular actings, or as if the Defender had been special author, whereas in this Article anent the treating with, and home bringing of his Majestie (therein it is known the Defender, according to his bound duty) was most active and zealous, and therein he wrestled with all his might, and by his pains and Gods blessing thereon, overcame ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulties, and did effectuate the same. The Libeller does so far detract from the Defenders faithful discharge of his duty in this so glorious action, and without libelling the least presumption of any circumstance to make the same probable, the Defender is accused, as if he had in his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment been against his Majesties home coming; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And for further clearing hereof, if this Article shall be further insisted on, my Lord Advocate will be pleased to condescend who the parties were, that made the motion for addresses to his Majestie, of whom the Defendent should have been afraid, if he had been of a contrary judgement, to have opposed openly; for if the Defender had so great sway in affairs (as all along the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Articles he is allowed to have had: and also, if he had intended (as is broadly and with foul month alledged) in the said Libel all along alledged, to have extirped and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:65289:30"/>
evacuated the Kings Majesties Authority, Government and Posterity, and had such correspondence with those abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Regicides, as all are perswaded by the said libel to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, in the said year of God 1649. when the said Traytors were strong, and both this land through divisions and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therways very low, and when the power was in the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and his complices their hands (as my Lord Advocate is pleased to libel and term them) who at that time had the managing of affairs; then was the fittest time and best op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, if they had any such disloyal thoughts, to have shaken off that Government; but so far did they abhor any such treachery, That they not only proclaimed His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and according to their duty owned His Interest (even with the hazard of their lives and fortunes) there being noneso shallow but easily might have seen that the discharge of the said duty would bring upon themselves and the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the power of <hi>England</hi> (the onely power of Arms and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being at that time in the abominable Regicides their hands) who did immediately thereafter invade this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>As to the other member of the Tenth Article, whereby it is libelled, <hi>That the Defendor (to obstruct His Majesties pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, yea in so far as in him lay, and to terrifie him therefrom, by his and his complices crulelty executed upon the Marquess of</hi> Montross, <hi>who as his Majesties Commissioner did represent his Majesties person) caused to murder the said Marquess in</hi> anno 1650. <hi>in manner,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is no way releivantly libelled, that the Defendor in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral caused murder him, except it were condescended <hi>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> modo</hi> he caused; and if thereby be meant his voycing in Parliament 1649. in the said matter; <hi>non relevat,</hi> because a vote, Act or sentence of Parliament is no way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leivant to infer a crime against any particular member there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as hath been oft before alleadged.</p>
            <p>Likewise 2. The sentence of the forfeiture of the life and estate of the said Marquess, was no decree of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:65289:31"/>
1649. but of the Parliament 1645, which was homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logat by several other Acts of Parliament, excepting the said Marquess among other excepted persons, as specially by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> and by the 22 Act of the Parliament 1648.</p>
            <p>And yet 3. The Defendor did not vote in the business of <hi>Montrost,</hi> as he can prove (if need be is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) by the members there present 1649. And as to the aggravations of the said Murder, the said Marquess being His Majesties Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner for the time, It is no way a releivant circumstance to aggravate the same, except it had been libelled, That the said Commission had been shown to the Parliament, which no body can affirm; but on the contrary, the said Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment conceived they had just reason to presume that there could be no such Commission for his coming against them at that time, because His Majesty after the murder of His Royal Father, very graciously had admitted their graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Applications to him.</p>
            <p>Likeas before <hi>Montross</hi> his coming at that time to <hi>Scotland,</hi> and always thereafter, His Majesty had a Committee of the said Parliament, under the name and title of the Committee of Estates of His Majesties Kingdom of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to the Defendor his alledged <hi>keeping correspondency with</hi> Cromwel <hi>in the year</hi> 1650. As the same is irrelevantly libelled, no deeds nor acts or correspondency being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descended on; so there was never any such thing. And there was one named <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who vented this untruth, hanged at <hi>Sterling,</hi> and at his death did declare, That the same was a mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t unjust calumny; and it is not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leived that at that time he would have charged his soul with a lie, and in Law the words of a dying man are oricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously beleived.</p>
            <p>As to the Act of the West-Kirk, the Defendor (no ways acknowledging the releivance of the said Article, as it is libelled) was so free from having the least accession to the said Act or Declaration; that so soon as he got know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:65289:31"/>
thereof, to evidence his fidelity to his Majesty, it is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to be proved by witness (for their loyalty above all exception) that when the first news came that the Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners were about the drawing of the said Act, the Defendor gave advice to His Majesty, To draw a fair Declaration, and to go such a length, as in freedom he could, that thereby he might prevene the said Act, and obviate the pressing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: But as for the other that was pressed, he was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther against the same, and dealt with the Minister who came from the Commission of the Kirk, to forbear pressing. His Majesty therewith, which also if need were might be proved.</p>
            <p>As to the eleventh Article and subsequent Articles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the same are for deeds of compliance after the Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers had prevailed and were in possession: Before the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor make particular answer it is necessary to premise in general, that it being notoriously known to the world (to the eternal honor of this Kingdom) as for that damnable usurpation of <hi>Oliver,</hi> not onely we were not active in esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing the same, but according to our bound allegiance to our Soveraign, were to the utmost possibility of our power in arms under His Majesty, and other ways active a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and in opposition thereto, many lost their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states, many their lives, and all of us our liberries; and when we could do no more, being oppressed by the force of the said Usurper (as a chaste forced Virgin) we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We have suffered, and been only passive under that irresistable force. And as this was the condition of the Kingdom, so specially the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor, who as he had been most active and instrumental in His Majesties home-bringing (which was the only ground of the quarrel, and for which he was looked upon by them, as one of their capital enemies) even so after it
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:65289:32"/>
pleased God for our exercise and punishment, to suffer their power to prevail over all his Majesties Forces, and over this Kingdom such aversion had the Defender, even so much as to live under their power, let be, to comply actively with them, that after <hi>Worcester,</hi> the Defender offered to Mr. <hi>David Dick,</hi> if he could get his company, or the company of any other honest Minister, that he would never capitulate with any Englishman, so long as he could subsist in any part of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> either his lands or Isles thereupon: It is humbly cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that Mr. <hi>David Dick</hi> may be examined; neither did the Defender ever capitulate with them, till <hi>August,</hi> 1652. having before that endeavoured, all that in him lay, to have perswaded those of <hi>Athol, Monteith,</hi> and other his Neighbours in the Highlands, to have concurred with him, that they might have joyntly made some probable force for resisting the overspreading power of the Usurper, but all in vain: Likewise, long before that time, the whole Forces and Strengths of the Kingdom were surrendered, yea, the whole Kingdom, by their Deputies and Representatives (who met at <hi>Dulk<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="61" facs="tcp:65289:32"/>
such jealousie had they of the Defender, that by his Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation, he was prisoner upon demand: Nither during all the time of their power over th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s Kingdom, had he ever any favour of the said English, but was always look upon by them with a most jealous eye: And for evidencing here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Defender humbly craves, that there be Comm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssion granted for examining of Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Vtter</hi> (anent what was deponed by Mac <hi>Nachtan,</hi> and several, <hi>viz.</hi> of the Defenders small affection to the Engl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This being the Defenders true case, it is hoped, that the honorable Court of Parliament, will take consideration how the Defender stood out as long as he could, till he was prisoner; and will have a different consideration of Subjects acting under the lawful Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate in exercise of his Authority by himself, or others law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully constituted by him; and of the actions under cruel Usurpation and Tyrannie, the lawful Magistrate being forced for his own safety, to abandon his Dominions and people to the lust and oppression of the unjust Usurper, (who was Master not onely of their fortunes and persons, but their lives, and all that was dear to them) and had for a long time detained the possession of his unjust Usurpation, and devouted the lawful Magistrate: Which case is not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly difference by all who write on that subject, but also <hi>Cook,</hi> in the third part of the Institutes of the Laws of <hi>England, cap.</hi> 10. anent his Treason, in expounding the Statute of the 25 of <hi>Edward</hi> the third, upon the words of the Statute <hi>Le Roy,</hi> puts such weight upon the Kings being in possession, or one of the same, that he expressly affirms, the Statute is to be understood of a King regnant, and in possession of the Crown and Kingdome; as also, that in such cases, a favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able consideration is to be had of the actions of a subject who was particularly noticed, and jealously looked upon by the Usurper, for his affection to the lawful Magistrate and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:65289:33"/>
his Government: (All which being remitted to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner his grace, and the Honourable Parliament their consideration) he now comes to answer to the eleventh Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle: Against which eleventh Article, and all the members thereof, as libelled it is alledged, the said Article is general, not condescending on the day or moneth, nor on the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular year of God of the committing of the deeds therein libelled, but onely alternative in <hi>Anno</hi> 1653. or 1654. and therefore (as has been oft before alledged) the same is inept, and there can be no proces thereon. 2. It is not conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scending on, nor cleared, which of the acts of Parliament libelled on in the Proposition, this Article, and several mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers thereof, are subsumed, and therefore it is obscure and general, and in that incertitude, the Defender has reason to deny, that it can be subsumed on any of the said Acts, to infer the said crime ond pain.</p>
            <p>As to that which is first libelled in this Article, <hi>That the Defender did not rise in Arms with the Commissioner his grace, and the Earl of</hi> Glencarn, <hi>who were Commissioners by his Majestie.</hi> The Defender he repeats the two exceptions aforesaid against the whole Article, being confident this cannot be subsumed on none of the Acts libelled on: And further alledges, that it is not relievancy libelled, to infer, (<hi>vel minimam culpam</hi>) against the Defenders, far less so high a crime, except it were libelled, that your Lordships Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner had been shewed him, and he required, which was never done: And herein he may refer himself to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioner, his Graces Declaration, and if his Grace does not remember, that the Defender sent him word, shewing his desire to have met with his Grace, and to have spoke with him about the business; but had never the honour to have his Graces answer or appointment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. For further clearing, that his not joyning, except he had been required, is no crime, it is evident from the fourth Act of the first Parliament, <hi>Iac.</hi> 1. that those onely are punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, who does not assist the Kings Host, being required thereto: and <hi>Craig. pag.</hi> 365, says, that because the King

has so many Vassals, they are not obliged, nor cannot be punished, except the particular pain to be inflicted upon the away-stayer, be particularly exprest in the Edict by which they are commanded to appear: and pag. 365. he says, That these who come not, being warned by an Edict, shall be counted, and pag 370. he says, That the Vassal should not be obliged to appear at any such services, except they be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, which command should be proven by his Peers: These Edicts were particularly required by the fundamental Law, and were called <hi>heri bona,</hi> which is defined by <hi>Cujas</hi> to be the calling and citation of the Army, and is <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>quart. leg. franc.</hi> to be the punishment of him who comes not to the Kings Host, when he is called, and this assertion is clearly proven from <hi>Rague,</hi> in his Treatise <hi>de Iur.

               <item>2. And except they have for them reasonable excuses: but sure it is, the Defender not only was never required, as has been alledged, but there was even pregnant reasons, as he humbly conceives, the which it seemed very probable at that time, that albeit it be the duty of all his Majesties subjects, to rise for his Majesties interest, in opposition to Usurpers, yet it was not seasonable, as affairs then stood, till either they had been defeated by sea in the ingagement that they then had with <hi>Holland</hi> (whereby both the forces might have been diverted, and the Transportation of Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als and Ammunition from <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> and the parts of <hi>Scotland</hi> under their command, and their Army in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> might have been intercluded;) or that <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>France</hi> had concluded that peace whereof there was then several reports, and thereupon his Majesties subjects in <hi>Scotland,</hi> might have had hope of some probable assistance in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings in his Majesties service; or that division and in consequence confusion, had fallen out in the English

Army amongst themselves, whereof there seemed to be but little hope, so long as the appearance for His Majesty should meet them as against a common enemy, as it was. Likeas it would be thought it should have no other effect; and as in effect the event proved, that that Army never divided till they had no common enemy, against whom mutual preservation does necessitate a mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinse, but all at amity one with another. And albeit a particular command had not been absolutely necessary (if His Majesty had been there in person) yet in a juncture of time wherein such a War was improbable for many state reasons (which induces the Defendor to beleive that there was no Commission granted at that time) which presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <hi>excusant a dolo,</hi> and without dole (as has been said for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly) there can be no crime: And though he had been required, yet could not have been punished for his not obeying, seeing in effect he was the enemies prisoner up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on demand.</item>
            </list>
            <p>But this is conceived onely to be libelled as an aggravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what followed, which is, <hi>That he joyned in open hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity with the Vsurpers, forces, especially with the Colonels</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verton, <hi>and</hi> Twisleton, <hi>at the least</hi> Cobbet <hi>and</hi> Twistleton, <hi>at the least</hi> Twisleton, <hi>when he was in the Highlands, and in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the said Earls.</hi>

            <p>It is answered, 1.

And as to the alternative, That he joyned with one or other of them, it is most lax and obscure, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in that also this Dittay is inept: And for the alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive added <hi>(at the least he gave counsel) non relevat</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause general) except the counsel were condescended on, and that it were such as might fall under the Acts libelled on; and the most that can be alleadged, if the time were condescended on of his alleadged joyning, is, that he was in

The said <hi>Lilburn</hi> immediately upon the notice thereof having come with a considerable party of the English Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to <hi>Dunbarton,</hi> and sent to the Defender to meet him, and to go along with him in <hi>Arguile</hi> towards <hi>Kentyre</hi>: If the the said Colonel does not know and perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the Defender shunned the meeting, and would not go, whereupon he returned back with the forces af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he was at the length of <hi>Lothlomond,</hi> whereupon the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendor humbly craves that he may be urged to declare; As also that the Countess of <hi>Balcarras</hi> may be examined, if the defendor did not assist her and her Husband in their passage through <hi>Arguileshire,</hi> as they were going to a meeting at <hi>Finlarig,</hi> for the business in the hills, in the year One thousand six hundred fifty and three.

            <p>As to the last deed in the said Article, <hi>That the Defender in</hi> anno <hi>One thousand six hundred fifty and four, took upon him power to bring off such as was in that service, and to give remissions therefore, and particularly to</hi> John Mac Dowgall.</p>
            <p>It is general neither condescended on time nor person brought off, and therefore inept, and irreleivant. And if it be meant only of the person named, <hi>viz. John MacDow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall</hi> of <hi>Dumslich,</hi> it will never be made out that he was in that service, when the Commissioner his Grace, and the Earl of <hi>Glencarn</hi> was in the field; nor that ever there was a Remission granted by the defender to him or any other in relation to that service.</p>
            <p>As to the Twelfth Article and first member thereof, anent the defenders <hi>countenancing and assisting by his personal presence the Tyrannical and Treasonable Proclamation of</hi> Richard <hi>the Usurper and Protector of His Majesties Dominions at the Mercat cross of</hi> Edenburgh <hi>and</hi> Dunbarton.</p>
            <p>The defender is so notoriously innocent of this Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the Article, that he might with much confidence (in place of all other defence) simply deny it. But he will do no more for defence and clearing of his innocency, That where he is to propone his defence of <hi>alibi,</hi> that there month and day must be condescended on, whereof none is conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended on in this member of the Article; and till this be condescended on it is inept, and the defender ought to be assolzied therefrom; But the days of the said proclamation at <hi>Edenburgh</hi> and <hi>Dunbarton,</hi> being condescended on, the defender offers him to prove that during these days he was <hi>alibi,</hi> and neither at the City of <hi>Edenburgh</hi> nor <hi>Dunbarton</hi> all these days.</p>

<pb n="73" facs="tcp:65289:38"/>
overcome and perswade his reason to things absolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, for the subsistence at least for the preventing the ruine of the whole body of the Kingdoms, and of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties Leiges therein, as was the stopping that miserable uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which the Defender knew that it would be, as it had, been before, at even other Parliaments, so at that strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attempted, as indeed thereafter it was; which union was that Vorax, wherein our Religion, our ancient Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment Monarchick in his Majesties Person and Family, and the interest of Nobilities and our Liberties; were wholly swallowed up; and under pretext of being united, we were really enslayed to that pretended Commonwealth: The easing (if they could not perswade him to the taking off) of the maintenance and Sess (which upon <hi>Scotland,</hi> was six triple more then the proportion of <hi>England,</hi> and in it self so heavy, with the Excise and other publique burthens, laid by the Vsurper on it, that more was exacted in one moneth, then his Majesties Royal Predecessors would have imposed or taken of Taxation for an age, so that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey could not subsist under it;) as also taking off some of the Forces under which we were kept in bondage, if that at least could have been obtained: The prevention of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration and change of our whole Laws (which was vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently threatned) yea, and in general, the confounding and (<hi>dolo optimo</hi>) circumventing and defeating of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels by which the event proved, it was more hopeful and easie to overcome that force, then by might or power. And as the liberty of the Election of the Members in <hi>England,</hi> at that time of <hi>Richards</hi> Parliament made service to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie in it, hopeful to all his Majesties friends and loyal subjects; so was it no small encouragement to the Defender to go there for the same end, and at the meeting in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Scots affairs, and several other meetings, when they were upon the debate of the said union, the Defender (of purpose to stop the same) did propone, that there could be no union, except it were agreed, that we might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy

joy our Religion in <hi>Scotland</hi> without alteration, as it was established by our own Laws; and that we might be ruled and judged according to the same Laws, and except our Sess were proportioned according to theirs in <hi>England:</hi> All which concerns the Defender knew would never be granted; and were indeed so utterly improbable at that time, that the proposition thereof was construed for no other end, then for the end aforesaid, to stop the said union: Likewise, it did so well succeed, as in effect it did obstruct it (as the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral persons of quality that were present can, and if need be, will declare;) and at that meeting, the actings and usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Vsurper <hi>Oliver,</hi> and the oppressions of that Army were of purpose much called in question, to make that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and them odious, which accordingly happily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and such a breach and confusion amongst them was made, that their affairs thereafter could never come to any consistency, which made considerably and evidently, way to his Majesties happy and glorious Restitution: To all which joyning, That the call and command of the arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Force, has <hi>Purenes necessitates,</hi> a necessity of obeying ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon persons under their power; it will follow from what is alledged out of these abovecited authors, founded strongly on reason, the Defender in that state of affairs had necessity and some obligation, to go and essay what could be by counsel, wisdom and prudence (since now there was no strength nor might left) effectuate for the standing, at least, to evite the ruine of the Countrey, in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars above mentioned, and others of that nature; at least, the Defender, as all of us, was under their force, and for eviting of his own and the Countreys ruie, <hi>habuit Parenes necessitatem:</hi> and by consequence there was no design of Treason therein; but by the contrary, most loyal intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, upon good ground of hope, and very probable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance: And therefore it is hoped, the Commissioners Grace, and the Estates of Parliament, will not finde this member relievant, to infer so high a crime against the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:65289:39"/>
(<hi>how maxime attento</hi>) that beside publique ends, it was even a necessary self-preservative act, for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der had several other things of personal interest, as that, that they had ordained him to pay to them about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>For eviting whereof, he behoved to go at that time to <hi>London,</hi> and could not have his person secured from ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restments there, but by going in Commission: And it is known, that his Majestie is so gracious, as in not a few, to excuse what they did of that nature, to evite (though but their own personal ruine) not imputing it to unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness in them at such a time; according to whose glorious and imitable example, it is (with much confidence hoped) that the Commissioners Grace, and Honourable Estates of Parliament, will have a favourable construction of what the Defender did in that particular, being necessitated thereto, both for publique and private interest, without any deceit or fraud, either in the intention or event, there being nothing at that time, while the Defender was there, done for confirming the Vsurpation, or excluding his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties interest.</p>
            <p>Likewise, it may appear, that it was onely the concourse both of publique and private interests and necessities, afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, that moved the Defender to go at that time; because, though he was desired oftimes before to go, yet he still refused till then: He was one of the last that went to that, being the very last pretended Parliament under their power; not till long after that Commissioners had gone for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for several years, and that all had submitted to their

Constitutions, and were of necessity made use of as Laws for the time.</p>

            </p>
            <p>It is answered, That it is notor, Nobility was not then respected at all, nor was any ground of excuse, the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to the elections being commanded to all, as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (and so Noblemen and others heretofore met promis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culously through all the Nation) as is notoriously to all known.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is libelled, <hi>That he had not his residence within the Shire:</hi> it ought to be repelled as irrelievant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is true, and was known to the Usurpers, and their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters and underlings, that he had land within the said Shire, and that considerable: so that he could not decline the said employment, without prejudice, the will and lust of the Vsurper at that time being uncontroulable, and tied to no rules of law or iustice.</p>
            <p>And where it is inferred, <hi>That sitting and voting in that pretended Parliament, he acknowledged his Majesties power and interest to be in the Usurpers person.</hi> It is answered, 1. He acknowledged the same no otherways, but as all the Kingdom did, to wit, <hi>de facto,</hi>; for <hi>de facto</hi> the Vsurper had taken or possest himself of the power, as his Majestie is pleased to speak of it, in his Proclamation sanent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with <hi>Portugal,</hi> in October last, and had detained the same for a long time: But neither the Defender, nor any other loyal subject, ever did or will acknowledge, that <hi>de Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> the same belonged to him, or that he had any just right or lawful title thereto (as also <hi>Lessius</hi> says in the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written place, speaking of them that seeks from Vsurpers that use of Government, whereunto he says, they are
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:65289:40"/>
holden in and obliged, once taking on them the Government, (though sinfully and unlawfully:) they seek the benefit of it, says he not absolutely, but under a tacit condition, <hi>viz.</hi> If the Usurpers will take upon them the Government, <hi>Petunt</hi> (saith he) <hi>sub tacita quadam conditione si velit se pro principe gerere,</hi> speaking of the Usurper, and that the Usurper would not give the use of the power he had taken upon him, but in the way he pleased, was his crime which he continued during his usurpation. In respect of all whiew, it is humbly craved, That the defender may be assolzied from the crime of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son libelled thereupon.</p>
            <p>Like as for the defendors further clearing in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, it is humbly desired that certain Ministers and others above exception, whom the defender shall condescend on may be examined, if after his return from <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1658. he did not express with great joy his hopes That business in <hi>England,</hi> did tend toward His Majesties advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> That a Commission be directed for examining Sir <hi>Anthony Ashly-Cooper,</hi> and several other Englishmen above all exception, how the defendor express himself in private anent his dissaffection to that Usurpation during his being there the time of the said Parliament, even though to his very great hazard at that time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item,</hi> That certain persons upon whose names also he shall condescend may be examined, if the defender to their certain knowledge the time of Sir <hi>George Booths</hi> ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing (which fell out immediately after the defendors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the said Parliament) did not put himself out of the way, being informed that he was to be secured, and thereupon delaid his journey to <hi>Caithness,</hi> and so readier to have laid hold upon any opportunity that should have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for His Majesties Service and restitution; that time being the most probable that ever offered after <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the precept of Twelve twonsand pound <hi>sterling,</hi>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:65289:41"/>
which is alleadged the Defendor got from the Usarper.</p>
            <p>It is answered, The Defendor did indeed obtain a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, but not as a reward of any service (which he never neither did, nor desired to deserve from them) but for what they had wrongfully intromitted with, of the half of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of Wine and Strong water (whereunto the defendor had right by Act of Parliament, before they had any power in <hi>Scotland.</hi>)</p>
            <p>And as to the Thirteenth Article, First, For the whole Article, it is not consented on what Act of Parliament, the same consisting of three different members is subsumed, and till it be condescended on, there can be no process there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
            <p>And as to the first member thereof, anent the words alleadged spoken at <hi>Innerary.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. No time condescended on, and therefore the libel in that part is inept for the reasons afore mentioned, for which a criminal dittay ought to be special in the time at least year and month.</item>
               <item>2. Whereas it is libelled, <hi>He rebuked the Ministers for praying for the King</hi>; in the words libelled, <hi>or some such like words; Non relevat</hi> as to the Ministers, except the persons were condescended on whom he rebuked.</item>
               <item>3. <hi>Nonrelevat, Some such like words</hi>; some such like being most general, except the words were particularly li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled, alleadged to be such like, whereby the defender might advise his defences, and alleadge why they were not such like, as he would, if any words ever he spoke were condescended on. For the truth is he never spoke any such words: And was so far from rebuking any for praying for the Kings Majesty, That after the defeat at <hi>Worcester</hi> (which is the general time libelled, wherein he should have rebuked the Ministers for praying for the King) he himself caused continual praying for His Majesty both in his Parish Church and family, yea even in presence and audience of the English when they came there, though
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:65289:41"/>
it was to his great hazard so to do.</item>
            </list>
            <p>As to the second Member anent the words libelled and alleaged to have been spoken by the defendor at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, That he wondered how the people should be so mad as to call home a Family whom God had rejected, and would never restore</hi>; or some such like words.</p>
            <list>
               <item>First, This is also general, neither time, that is, year nor moneth, nor particular place condescended on.</item>
               <item>Secondly, It is libelled, <hi>That it was in the presence of persons of quality,</hi> they ought to be condescended on.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, In so far as it is libelled the defender said <hi>The people was mad to call home His Majesty</hi>: It is general and inept, not condescending what people, and what was the occasion; if there was any motion made of calling home the King, whereupon that should have been spoken, and among whom it was: And <hi>Damhanders cap. 30. prax. com. num.</hi> 4. and others says, <hi>A criminal Dittay should be most clear and contain, Omnes criminis patrari qualitates, lib. 30.

               <item>Fourthly, <hi>Some such like words, Non relevat,</hi> except the words were specially condescended on, which if they were the Defender would alleage and evince they were no wise such like, for the truth is, he never spake any such words, but on the contrary did all that he could there to make way for His Majesties happy Restitution; as has been at length cleared of before.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And was a very suspected person, in so far as in the year One thousand six hundred fifty seven, <hi>Oliver</hi> was so jealous of the Defendor, That he commanded him to stay at <hi>London,</hi> and not to return to <hi>Scotland,</hi> till his affairs (as he was pleased to express) were settled: So that not without great difficulty, by the mediation of the Lord <hi>Brongbil</hi> and <hi>Charls Fleetwood,</hi> he obtained his liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:65289:42"/>
whereupon the Defender desires the said <hi>Charls Fleetwood</hi> to be examined, which he also desired at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi> And not onely was suspected as odious to the English for his known affection thereunto: As is notorious and has also before been exprest.</p>
            <p>As to the third member of the said Article, anent the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadged speech in <hi>Mastertones.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Neither the year nor month condescended on, and therefore general as to the time, and inept.</item>
               <item>2. As to the first member thereof, <hi>That he would own any thing he had done.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>First, It is exceedingly general, and not releivant, except what were the things he had owned were specially conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended, and what time, year and month; it is an unparalleld generalty, and therefore till made special, no process there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It can import nothing in common sence wherein to own a thing is to acknowledge it for a mans own, <hi>But what he had acknowledged to be his own whether word or deed, he would yet acknowledge,</hi> which is an expression of ingenuity, and no crime, and this being the received sence of owning, the word cannot be strained to any other sence, or if occasion should be taken so to do, and that another sense could be put on that expression, yet being <hi>more interpretatio capienda est,</hi> the most-being interpretation is to be taken. <hi>Perd. ea qua S. I. 1. F. de reg. Iuris,</hi> as being both justest and safest by that Law. And in ambiguous speeches, or such as may receive two sence, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is the best expounder of his own mind, and his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation ought to be admitted, <hi>per Leg. in ambiguiis F. de reg. Iuris</hi> and other laws. But the sense aforesaid is so plain that there is no place for caption.</p>
            <p>As to what follows in the said member, <hi>That if what he had owned or done were to do, he would do it again, albeit he had known that all that has been would have come.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. As is alleaged against the first part of this member, this is exceedingly general, but as to the time and month he should have spoken it on.</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:65289:42"/>2. As to what the things are that he would doe if they were to be done, and that time the things were done or owned to be done, on that the saying that he would doe if they were to doe is a crime.</item>
               <item>3. What were those things in particular, that are understood or may be subsummed under the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall of all things that has comed to passe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it may be inferred, that that were a crime to the Defender to have said, that notwithstanding of them he would doe what he had done if that were to doe; and therefore the Libel in this part of the member is also general, obscure and inept: And to evince the ineptitude of this generality, suppose the Defender were thus indicted; You are indicted for all that ye have done the times by-gone preceeding your being in <hi>Iames Master<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnes</hi> house after your coming for <hi>London,</hi> were not that ditty without all controversie Irrelevant? Then is it not also Irrelevant to be indicted for owning in general that he had owned, or saying in general, that he would doe that he had owned du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that time if that were to doe again, without any further particular condescendance.</item>
               <item>Like as 4. There is a very clear and obvious and benign sense these words may have (if ever he spake, as he truly never remembers that he spake any such words, <hi>viz.</hi>) that if it had been possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that times could have returned, and actions to be done under the same circumstances and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations they had then, it is probable these same might be the Defenders actions again, though he had known that had comed thereafter, not having
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:65289:43"/>
connexion with or necessary dependance on these actings, each does not so much as import his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent thoughts or approbation thereof, but is very consistant with a present disapprobation of the same; And is it not ordinary to say, that if such times were as has been, or such motives or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of actions as has been, that it is very like I would be engaged in them as well as others, or as I have been my self? And yet to say with great consistance I ought not so to doe, like as truly it is known, and if need be, is offered to be proved, that the Defender, on the just contrary, had said to one Counsellour of <hi>Cromwels,</hi> and to many other famous Gentlemen, that things had been done wherein he would have been very far from engaging in, if he had seen what followed, which was the product of the corruption of evill men, that had abused what was well intended, for accomplishing of their wicked ends and (till they brake forth and could not be resisted) unknown designes. And the Defender hopes the sense afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said is very clear, and even though it were not so obvious, yet <hi>Rapienda est occasio quae benignus prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit responsum L — Rapiend. 168. F. de. reg. Iuris,</hi> That is any occasion should be even rest (as it were, though there were some violence done to the words) for a benign interpretation, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by all meanes that interpretation of the words that may seem to inferre a crime ought to be eschewed, or if the word might be drawn to any other sense, yet <hi>In dubiis benignior<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:65289:43"/>
the most benign sense is to be preferred <hi>pret. semp. 56. F. de reg. Juri</hi>; or where words are obscure, or may suffer two senses, the parties own interpretation is to be taken, as the best intepreter of his own mind; <hi>Per ca quae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </item>
               <item>5. The Doctors say, that <hi>voluntas &amp; proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum delinquentis distingunt facinora per legem ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressam Leg. qui in Iur. 53. F. de furtis in prae:</hi> That is the will and purpose of him that commits a crime, distinguisheth it, but <hi>velleitas,</hi> or <hi>voluntas in essicax,</hi> as it is called, not a will, but a would is no purpose to doe, and can be the cause of no crime, especially being about things past, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified with an impossible condition, if things alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy done were to doe (which is altogether impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible) that a deed done can return to have a new being and so to be done; and even there is some presumption of that mistake may be in this from the very place libelled, in which it is alledged to have been spoken, it being such as it is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that men may be very apt to fail both in judgement and memory, and so both wrong them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves &amp; misconstrue others. And as for the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations that follows, that by speaking these words,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:65289:44"/>
the Defender took upon him by outward success, to give judgement upon the secret Counsell of the Almighty. 1. As it is in nowise true that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender spoke any of the words libelled, so this does (as he humbly conceives) in nowise follow upon the words immediately going before alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed spoken in <hi>Mastertounes, viz:</hi> that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender owned what he had owned, or would doe the same if it were to doe, for that is not any Judgement given of any hidden counsels of the Lords, but in expression at most of his own acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And as for the words before these, albeit he had been so presumptuous as to say them (as he blessed the Lord he never was) yet it is not libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led that any thing that is therein alledged to have been spoken, either at <hi>Innerarrey</hi> or <hi>London,</hi> was spoken or inferred from providence and success: For the Defender blesses the Lord, he has been otherwise taught, then to use (or rather to abuse) so Turkish an Argument, and which the Lord has by his Majesties happy restitution so signally refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ed.</item>
            </list>
            <p>And as to the last Aggravation, that the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereby hardned others, such as otherwise was ill disposed, in their wicked courses towards his Majesty, it is indeed a sad reflection upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers herein not called however. 1. It is so ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral both as to these others and their courses, that it cannot, and the Defender hopes it shall have no weight, especially considering that 2. The Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der oppones his defences of before alledged, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all the members of this Article, whereby it
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:65289:44"/>
is clear, that as they are libelled they can inferre no such thing, in respect of all which the Defender ought to be assoilzied also from this Article of the ditty.</p>
            <p>As to the last Article. 1. It is not condiscended under which of the Acts of Parliament libelled on it is subsummed, and till then it is ineptly libelled, and there can be no process thereupon: Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Defender has the testimony of his own Conscience, yea &amp; of an higher, that nothing libelled therein is true, albeit if he had said that the Usurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers hazard was great from his Majesty, and if his Majesties designes took effect, they were ruined, the same were notour truths, and it ought to have been so; that is, it ought to be, &amp; it was good, they were in hazard from his Majesties designes; and it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s most just, that his Majesties designes should take effect to their ruine. And what crime could be in so saying he cannot apprehend; however he never spoke any such words to <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> or <hi>Ireton,</hi> which <hi>Ireton</hi> he never saw with his eyes; and did far more abhorre the least thought of giving counsell to challenge or question his late Majesty upon his precious Life, and his Innocency shall rest confident, absolutely to deny the same.</p>
            <p>And as to the last part of this Article, whereby it is libelled that in <hi>Anno</hi> 1649. in face of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament then sitting, he told that the Usurper <hi>Cromwell</hi> had told him, that <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> would never be at peace till the King were put to death. The Defender adheres as to this part
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:65289:45"/>
to the generall exception against all this Article.</p>
            <p>That it is not condiscended under which of the Acts of Parliament libelled on it is subsummed, till which be done there can be no process, and if it be intended that it be subsummed under the 43: Act 2. p. <hi>Iam.</hi> 1. and the 134. Act Parl. 8. and 10. Act and 10. Par. and 205. Act. 14. Parl. K. <hi>Iam.</hi> 6. all these Acts, as both by their titles and tenours, and by <hi>Skeine</hi> in his Index on the words leasing makers appears; and it seemes by their conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in this libell, they are understood also therein of lying and slandering his Majesty, and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, and the words libelled, though very horrid, yet seemes to be of another nature. And 2. to that Act 205. P. 14. <hi>Jam.</hi> 6. whereon only anything can be subsummed against him for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing and not apprehending. 1. It is generall as to the time when <hi>Cromwell</hi> should have told it to him, and therefore inept till the time be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discended on, which must be, especially seeing if it be not condiscended on, to have been after the Ingagement was broken; nothing can be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summed on the said act thereupon against the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, nor on his not apprehending him, for he was not holden thereto by that act expresly, except (according to Law) it had been in his power: But so it is, it is known that at that time it was not in the power of the whole Kingdome to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend him, whether his victory or strength be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, or the Kingdomes low and weak conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at that time, wherein they lay open to ruine by him, if the Lord had not restrained him more nor
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:65289:45"/>
their power could effectuate; and as to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing and not revealing, the Defender ought to assoilzied, because by the expresse words of the act, that revealing is declared to be such a reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to some of his Majesties Privy Counsell, or some under Officer, &amp;c. as that there through the Authors of slanderous speeches may be called, try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and punished; but that cannot be subsummed, except it were subsummed, that the speeches were spoken before witness, otherwise could not have been proved, and without probation could not have been so urged, as that sentence could have been given thereupon, and the Author punished, according to the words of the act, (which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so according to Common Law, and which is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after cleared); like as if the word thereafter should have been found treasonable, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender not being found able to have proved them, he should have brought himself under the crime of treason, for accusing another of treason, and not being able to prove it, and therefore could not be holden so to do: As also albeit the Defender had heard any such words as is libelled (which he altogether denies) and that before witness, yet through his revealing thereof the Author could not be tryed or punished, for it is noturly known it was above the power of the Kingdomes, at that time as said is, or for many yeares thereafter, to punish him; and therefore the Defenders not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing cannot be subsummed upon the said act of Parliament, to inferre the pain contained there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, or related unto.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:65289:46"/>Lastly, the pains of the said Act, and other Acts before mentioned together therewith, is not the pain of treason (as has been oft before evinced) and therefore the Defender cannot be convened for treason, or the pain thereof upon the said Acts, but ought to be assoilzied therefrom.</p>

cause, from the pain of death. Whence 3. It is alledged, even according to <hi>Clarus</hi> his opinion, concealing not releivant, to inferre the pain of death, except where the concealer has been conscious to, and heard some treaty; that is, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate consultation against the Prince or his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state: But so it is the words libelled, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what is alledged to have been heard in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1649. seems not to import that, being, as would appear, but <hi>volitantia verba,</hi> if any such thing had been heard, which the Defender abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely denies; and importing indeed the authour <hi>Cromwels</hi> thought or opinion, that there would be troubles still so long as his Majesty (<hi>horrendum dictum</hi>) were not put to death: But <hi>Clarus lib.</hi> 5. <hi>prax. crim.

Thereby making a clear difference betwixt a clear sole thought and a treaty, about committing the crime: Now the words as they are libelled do not import any treaty with any for committing that

horrid Murder, but the signification only of <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels</hi> damnable thought, what might be the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of not taking of the Life of our dread So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign.</p>
            <p>And hence 3. It will follow, that these words cannot be subsummed releivantly, under that part of the proposition of the Libell, because that any sense these words seemed to have as they are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belled, would appear only to import his naked thought of what might be the consequence of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the life of our then dread Soveraign, but no purpose of his to take the same; neither could any presume, albeit his thought anent that conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence had been true, (as it is most contrary to the truth) that yet any man, in whom there had been the least sparkle of common reason, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, would have purposed to commit, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted one of the highest evils of sin, to evit (though) very great evils of punishment, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a received rule among men, at least among Christian-men, That the least of the evils of sin should not be committed to evit the greatest of the evils of punishment.</p>

            <p n="5">5. All these Laws anent concealing and not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealing (as the Defender humbly conceives) must be understood where the treason is privately plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the execution thereof is carried on by secret conveyance, and which by revealing might be crushed and prevented: But it is not our that the Usurper, as he had the power of armed force, so he had the unparalleld boldness, to carry on his execrable treason most openly, and that his power was such, as it was impossible for his Majesties poor Subjects of this Kingdom to resist (nor yet his Majesties other Kingdomes, thoguh far more powerfull, and that many thousands of them from their souls abhorred the said act) or prevent, and impede the same. And if the Defender had heard any such words of the Usurper (as he has
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:65289:48"/>
just reason to deny he never heard) what ever they should im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; what probable reason might have been, for not reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it at that time, from the prevalency and power of that ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the condition of our poor Country, and utter impossibility to bring him to punishment, beside the want of probation, and so what place there were to <hi>Clarus</hi> his counsel of humanity, the Defender leaves to the Commissioner his Grace, and the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Estates of Parliament to judge.</p>
            <p n="6">6. What ever relievance there were in the Defenders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiling, yet his acknowledgement thereof in Parliament 1649. As libelled non relievant to infer or prove it. I. Because a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession that prejudgeth a party must be Judicial, that is, <hi>In Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicio, idque, utroque, Iure, &amp; Civili, Canonico,</hi> as says <hi>Panor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitane,</hi> C. <hi>Ex parte Decret. de confess. num. 16.</hi> That it must be in Judgement in a Process, wherein he who confesseth is convened, as is clear by <hi>Leg. 6.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:65289:49"/>
confessed what was libelled in judgment; and the Parliament had been sitting on that Process, but so it is, that neither is it, nor can be libelled, and therefore his naked acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not relievant, and in effect, if in any discourse before the Parliament, any such word had escaped the Defender, (which he no wise acknowledges) yet that such a passing and indeliberate word, should infer or prove a crime, or so high a crime against him, he is hopeful the Honourable Court of Parliament will be very far from ever finding; for the very reason why confession has so much weight, is because it is presumed that no man will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess against himself in judgment, that whereupon he is convened and processed without great deliberation, which holds not if the acknowledgment be given out of any process, there being no dependant action or processe upon the matter thereof: And therefore the Defender is confident that he needs not trouble the honourable Court with more legall dispute against the rele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the alleadged acknowledgment.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The words or acknowledgment lybelled as spoken in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, 1649. Can never be obtruded to the defender, nor that he was conscious to the Counsell of that horrid murther of his late Majesty, because it is notour, and he offers him to prove if need be, that the whole Members of the said Parliament, 1649. And he himself amongst others in plaine Parliament were purged by their Solemne Oathes of all knowledge of, or accession to that wicked designe in relation to the Kings Majesty and House of Parliament.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And yet he is so confident he never spake any such thing in Parliament, that the day being condescended on, and dyet of sitting of Parliament, as by all Doctors is agreed it ought to be, then the Defender offers to prove his alibi; he offers to prove (if need be) he was alibi all that dyet, and so not in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where he is alleadged to have spoken these words, and yet that the Defenders innocency as to the accession or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that horrid murder, may yet further appear, it is known to many persons, and to some of the Members of this present
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:65289:49"/>
Parliament, that when <hi>Cromwell</hi> was in <hi>Scotland,</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1650. (notwithstanding it is known what malice he had to the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at that time) In this particular he expressed himselfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Marquesse of <hi>Argyle, That he thought him a man that had neither Conragenor Honour to have been upon such a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse</hi>; and the Defender thanks God he had so much honour and honesty as in nowise to be accessory thereunto, and to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horre the same.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The Defender ought to be assoilzied from their two last Articles, as from all the other from the year 1641 to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties home coming to <hi>Scotland</hi> in <hi>Anno</hi> 1650. because of the ratification and oblivion contained in his Majesties Treaty at <hi>Breda,</hi> and most full and ample Act of ratification and oblivion at St <hi>Iohnstone</hi> and <hi>Strivling,</hi> Anno 1650. and 1651.</p>
            <p>And in regard the deeds libelled are either such as preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Treaty and Act of Oblivion in Anno 1641. And were thereby pardoned and buryed in Oblivion, or such as intervened after the yeare 1641. before his Majesties home coming in the yeare 1650. During which time he is in his Lybell charged with severall deeds which are irrelevant, and whereof the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender is most innocent. And for such publick actings as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender is charged with and had accession to, the Defender is also secured and pardoned by his Majesties Treaty &amp; gracious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discendance at <hi>Breda,</hi> which was also thereafter ratified in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or are deeds of necessary compliance both for the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and self preservation in that unhappy juncture, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyance as it was sore against his inclination, if it had been in his power to have helped, so is not no more then whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms did, and far less then many condescended to; It is in all humility expected, that the Defender should not be brought under the compassof Law for the same, which were as to make him the singular sufferer in so universal a guilt, so there can be no precedent therefore instanced, either out of Scripture, or holy Writ, the Histories of our own, or of other Nations, That a Subject not having contributed to the said usurpation, but to his power resisted the same, when the said unjust usurpation
