            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our importunity hath prevailed, and I
could wish my <hi>Answers</hi> to your <hi>Quaeres</hi>
might gaine this with you that they are
rather sent to please you then my selfe,
whose knowledge lies rather in the
Hyssop on the wall then the <hi>Cedars</hi> of
<hi>Lebanon:</hi> I assure you I would now goe home and
know my self, and study it throughly, <q>
                  <hi>Nam miser ille
qui notus nimis omnibus ignotus moritur sibi.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>First, In that you heard not from me upon the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
of <hi>Oxford,</hi> I heare so much of it on both eares,
and the distance was so little from <hi>London,</hi> that I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore
to report that to you, which you might have
beene an eye-witnesse of at so little charge and
trouble: onely let me be your true informer, that
you had nothing committed then by ours, that had
not its rise from integrity and faithfulnesse to the
State, accompanied with such skill, as the Lord was
pleased to dispence; and let me tell you, men upon
the place (in such case) can better judge, then lookers
on afarre off, I hope you will not lose by that bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97028:3"/>
in the end, though it seeme for present an ill
penniworth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, For <hi>Worcester,</hi> I am sorry so little is
spoken of it, where so much worth and gallantry ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
and indeed I cannot remember where I have
seene so much done in so short a time; where, when
that valiant Commander of Horse Colonell <hi>Whaley</hi>
had done his duty, and with the helpe of Countrey
forces had blockt up part of the Towne; foure Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of foote under the command of Colonell
<hi>Rainborow</hi> came, and raised works within Pistoll shot
of their royall Sconce and the City, the Enemy play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon them with Case-shot out of Sakers all the
time, wherein Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Pride,</hi> and Lieut.
Colonell <hi>Ewers</hi> had a chiefe share; whereupon the
Enemy accepts of those Propositions you have
seene: Master <hi>Richard Salwey</hi> a Member of the House
who was of our Councell in this Worke deserves
well of his Countrey and the Kingdome for his
wisedome and faithfulnesse many wayes: and truely I
wish Colonell <hi>Rainborow</hi> a sutable imployment by
Sea or Land, for both which God hath especially
fitted him, foraine States would be proud of such a
Servant: I Preached at <hi>Worcester</hi> at our comming in,
and afterwards, and did observe a doore open to the
Gospell.</p>
            <p>I am now fully satisfied with the Answer of my
many many Petitions that I might live to see this
day, this blessed day, and the last towne of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
taken: I am thinking whether to goe a few dayes
more in this Vale to admire what I have seene upon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97028:3"/>
Earth, and then dye, that I may praise him as he
would be praised, who hath founded mercies for his
servants, and brought forth deliverance to miracle
through Jesus Christ. I finde our Souldiers general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the old forme, rather wondring then boasting,
admired by the Enemy for their gallantry and
Conduct.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Your demand about the disposing the
Army, is not so proper for a private Pen to ingage
in; yet this I may say, that other Nations in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
would thinke, if they lookt round about
them and within them, the disbanding an Army (if
trusty) ought not to be a worke of hast: when the seas
are down in <hi>England,</hi> I thinke the passage unto <hi>Ireland</hi>
will be easier, and if we can maintaine a defensive
warre this Winter, I trust the Spring will invite ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
over thither: onely I wish the <hi>English</hi> a good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine
of all things, and that they would attend two
things in the <hi>Irish</hi> warre besides, <hi>viz.</hi> not to spend
time about Castles and Forts, but to become Master
of the Field: and secondly, to burne up the Enemies
provisions every where. The wild <hi>Irish</hi> and the <hi>Indian</hi>
doe not much differ, and therefore would be handled
alike: yet I could tell you a more excellent way; In
the meane, if these faithfull Commanders were in
Garrisons (without any designe be it spoken) you
have alwayes an Army ready, the private souldier
will still run to his honest and well-known Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;
yea, so firme they are, that if their Officer should
be changed, I beleeve those souldiers must be prest to
stay with others.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:97028:4"/>
Briefely, this I say to your Question, that this
Army was hardly gotten, and I wish it may be as
hardly disbanded; if you have no present imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
were I perswaded that forein threatnings
were in earnest; I wish this Army might be sent to
encounter them, and teach Peasants to understand
liberty, and I would not doubt but to see good fruit
of it soone, I would rather our men should live upon
their wine, then they upon our Beere: It is one of
the great interests of this State to keepe warre at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance:
Feare not that Army whose Commanders
(like <hi>Samuel</hi>) can aske any County or Towne where
they have been whose, Oxe or Asse they have taken?
never fewer complaints, not many men of such quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
whose designe is onely to obey their Masters: <hi>viz.</hi>
The Parliament, the slighting the Army is their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
triumphant chariots would have broke our
necks.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Whereas you desire some expedient to
the difference: I assure you the question in hand: and
the Lord walking in the clouds towards us, it is no
wonder we walke in the darke among our selves. And
truly it woundes my soule, when I thinke <hi>Ireland</hi>
would perish, and <hi>England</hi> continue her misery
through the disagreement of ten or 20. learned men:
but if you will pardon and pitty my folly, I will state
the disease, and then we have half, won the cure.
To omit the three common enemies that befoole lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and unlearned, noble and ignoble, Gentleman
and Peasant, I meane the flesh, the world, and the
devill. You shall find our; First and maine mischiefe
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:97028:4"/>
lies in our spirits, which are now made so keene and
thorny, that they cannot be touch'd but by a paire of
iron gloves, could wee but conquer each others
spirit, wee should soone befoole the divell, and
his Instruments: to which end I could wish we
that are Ministers might pray together, if that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be, let us speake together, eate and drinke toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
because if I mistake not, estrangement hath
boyled us up to jealousie and hatred.</p>
            <p>2. Let us much studie, hold forth, and rejoyce
in what we agree, as please our selves, and grieve
others in what we differ, our animosities may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
our selves, but wrong the Gospell.</p>
            <p>3. Let us remember <hi>England,</hi> as it was never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered
but by faction, so it can never be ruled but by
love; the same Last will not fit an <hi>English</hi> and a
<hi>Scotish</hi> foote, they come not suddenly to what they
enjoy, and therefore should give <hi>England</hi> a little brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
over what is propounded, It will be their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
to keepe what they have, and our to be growing
up to what we desire.</p>
            <p>4. An evill lies in this, that we unwillingly drive
on our enemies designes: <hi>Barnevelsh</hi> laid his project
upon an <hi>Arminian</hi> bottome, and so made Religion a
stalking horse to his Politick ends.</p>
            <p>5. Let the present Church-government goe on,
and walke softly and tenderly, let those that lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
for it improve it, <hi>&amp; valeat quantum valere potest:</hi>
Let others that are godly know it may helpe, at least
to hew stone, and square timber for a more glorious
building, to bring from one extreamitie to another,
God useth his owne media onely, violence becometh
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:97028:5"/>
not Saints: In Popish times the Clergie had not the
coercive power, but subjected the civill magistrate
to doe their worke; I wish the State keepe a good
bolt upon that doore: I am confident the chiefe
meanes to greater an error will be by violence and
opposition, when slighted it dyes. Coales blowne
get heat and strength, neglected grow cold. I wish
every one might be severely punished that spoke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
either Presbytery or Independencie till they
could define that aright, and distinguisht about them
and their wayes, them I beleeve we stole hvee <hi>altum
silentium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, men are not in their proper worke, which
excentrick motions produce many things uncoucht:
I need not particularize, but when I see the langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing
perishing conditions of many Counties, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
want of preaching I must be bold to say to
wrangling is none of our proper worke; I think we
might doe God more service in Studie and Pulpits,
then in waiting at great mens doores, and working
them up to their selvish interests. I could adde that
we take <hi>causam pro non causa,</hi> we put our troubles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
schismaticks, and opinionists, and never attend the
true cause: There may shortly be a great change in
the <hi>Nether-Lands,</hi> but you shall finde the cause not
in the harmelesse <hi>Anabaptists,</hi> whereof there are
swarmes, but in some <hi>Hispaniolized</hi> Statesmen.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Your demand of my thoughts of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
in order to forraigne States, I answer with a
wish, <hi>viz.</hi> That forthwith we might have some
choise agents sent out as two to <hi>Sweden,</hi> two to the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97028:5"/>
               <hi>Cantons</hi> our good friends, two to the <hi>Netherlands,</hi>
and so to other parts as we see cause, and these ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with a Manifest of Gods gracious dealings
with this State, letting them to know we omitted
this worke in our misery lest our friends might
feare us for beggers, but now being upon an even foot
with them, we let them know our condition, and how
ready we are to owne them against a common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
every man in this Nation pretending to soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery
upon good experience. This being done, and
our Navey in its true <hi>English</hi> beauty, I would not
doubt but others may be as glad to know an <hi>English</hi>
man, as we desire acquaintance with them. And if
our back-doore were well shut at home, how might
<hi>Euphrates</hi> be dried up; I meane the <hi>West Indies</hi> and the
<hi>East</hi> too offer themselves to our devotion. Let us
still remember the support of Trade is the strength
of this <hi>Island,</hi> discountenance the Merchant, and take
beggery by the hand. This is the misery of <hi>England</hi>
whilest others are beate into slavery, they are apt to
be complemented into it.</p>
            <p>Other Kingdomes and Countries are therefore
terrible to us, because we are so little terrible to
them: Were we not more effeminate then our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors
in Queene <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, I know not why
three Kingdomes should doe lesse then one; you see
we can fight if we must, I dare undertake if you can
finde worke abroad, it will not be hard to finde men:
nay it were easie to finde both, if we were agreed at
home: What you heare of a conjunction between
the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> and his Lieutenant Generall the
Duke of <hi>Lorrayne</hi> with some promises from his
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97028:6"/>
Uncle <hi>Bavaria</hi> need not trouble you, the <hi>Danes</hi> and
<hi>Saxons</hi> never mastered this <hi>Island</hi> by power, but by
our home-bred distempers. To prevent those feares
let <hi>English</hi> men keepe to their proper Interests, and
<hi>Scots</hi> to theirs, and I know not why we might not
march into <hi>Bavaria</hi> and <hi>Lorrayne</hi> before they come
unto us, and make them pay all old Arreares. I must
confesse I am divided between <hi>Ireland</hi> and the <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinate,</hi>
onely I quiet my selfe in this that we may
doe both.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Touching the preserving and improving
the Conquests and mercies: I onely commend unto
you these few rules.</p>
            <p>1. By the same meanes the mercy is gained it may
be preserved, if men, yea good men were instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall
in the one, they must be in the other; confide
when you see reason to confide: thy friend and thy
fathers friend put price upon, he that loves you and
your Countrey may be trusted to conserve what is
wonne: to which adde praying, and beleeving, for in
all these God hath appeared: I would as soon credit
a garrison to a knowne honest godly <hi>English</hi> man,
differing from me in his opinion, as all <hi>France</hi> being
most Catholicke trust it selfe to their Protestant
Leaders.</p>
            <p>2. Walke plainely in your Counsells, God needs
no mans lyes to carry on his worke. Commonly
these <hi>Arcana Imperii</hi> and <hi>ruina populi,</hi> let your yea be
yea, and your nay nay. God preserveth the simple:
Doe but observe the Historie of <hi>Europe,</hi> and you shall
finde those admired deepe set counsells of men
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:97028:6"/>
mingled with so much flesh, have proved but grasse.</p>
            <p>3. If <hi>England</hi> be now a conquered Kingdome,
we cannot have much to begge of a conquered ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and therefore I could wish all markes of slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
might be taken off, and since God hath invested
us with our almost lost liberty, let it be our care
that after ages may not say we conquered our selves
into a new slavery.</p>
            <p>4. Because not onely our selves, but also the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
of our late enemies confesse the influence of
the City is such, that we could not have wanted it,
and therefore their highest designe now is to make
it royall, you may remember how willing I was
once to have made a match, my weakenesse was such
that I did not study whether both parties were well
agreed, and my simplicity kept me from thinking
of a Corrivall, yet now I pray improve your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests,
and let <hi>London</hi> know that if they thinke a
Parliament sits the quieter by being so neare them,
so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> thinke when the Parliament doores are shut
up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Westminster,</hi> their shops will hardly stand open
at <hi>London:</hi> If the clashing of swords cannot be heard,
yet death clinching up their windowes by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of the plague calls for something.</p>
            <p>5. Justice will exalt and maintaine a Nation, I
wish they might be first sharers in it, that first ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured
their estates and lives; had the Citizens
remonstrated more about their debts due, and lesse
about their wills, they might had more thankes,
and (it may be) by this time some might have kept
Orphanes from their doores, that crie for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:97028:7"/>
lent to supply the States use, he that will ride a
free horse to death, may in time be spurring a dull
Jade to no purpose. And for distributive Justice,
let it be impartiall. Two things may breake the
Axle-tree of any State, <hi>viz.</hi> First, Opposition to
knowne truthes, or slighting that Religion in the
purity of it, which we owne in mixtures, and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
bloud not wiped off by the hand of Justice. A
State may stand upon any frame of Government,
if fastened together with Justice, Charity, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry,
the onely upholders of that flourishing
Neighbour-Nation the <hi>Netherlands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Lastly, Because <hi>England</hi> is devout, and Religion
of one kind or another carries most prevalency, and
that this Nation acts generally upon religious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions,
above any I know, therefore that which
hath been our wound must be our cure (preaching
and Preachers I meane) the Gentry must be base, and
so the Parliament unsupplyed of good members;
the common-people will worship any dunghill-god,
the City is full of blacke iniquity, if preaching be
neglected: how long therefore shall I intreat some
three or foure Itinerary Ministers in a County? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists
went out before Churches were setled,
how easily might the Land be (in some measure) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to God, and their owne civill Interests, if
provision was laid in of this kinde? but you will
object we have above nine thousand parishes, and
not a thousand able men: I answer, you see the
need of Itinerants, and secondly, Why may we not
follow the practise of other Reformed Churches?
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97028:7"/>
and gather up godly youths out of shops, and send
them for improvement somewhere, why not a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of <hi>Oxford</hi> set apart to that use? and if men
cannot answer the narrow examen of an Assembly,
why might there not be a Committee to judge of
some competency in some men for the present to
send out, though they should fall short of Arts and
Tongues? <hi>John Alasco</hi> was a Baron, yet in <hi>Edward</hi>
the sixts time, you may see what Church worke he
did: why not learned godly Gentry, Lawyers, that
might be spared some of them, physicians, &amp;c. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
this way? teaching their tenants were a
better Trade, then racking of Rents by some of our
Gentry. How ripe have I found <hi>Herefordshire</hi> and
<hi>Worcestershire</hi> for the Gospell, and many other
Counties? Helpe Lord!</p>
            <p>To the Question concerning my self; I answer,
I am at present upon a good Study, ever how to
want what the Lord is not willing to give: I am
turning my cheeke to the smiter: I have been think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to answer sixe or seven Pamphlets that name me
either enviously or disgracefully, but yet remaine
doubting. The Lord rebuke Satan. I see (with <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy</hi>)
though I neither borrow nor lend, &amp;c. yet
this may be my portion. This I must say, if either in
Doctrine or Practise I have failed, the time is not
yet wherein any Brother in a way of God hath dealt
with me: and if my different judgement offend any,
my Answer is, that with much expence of money
and time, with diligent inquiry into reformed
Churches, I have taken paines to satisfie my selfe,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:97028:8"/>
and remaine now where I was for substance fifteene
yeares since, resolving by that experience to keepe a
window open to more light and truth, though
scoft and slighted; my care hath beene to acquaint
my selfe with the most learned and godly in the
Countrey where I travell, first I lived about sixe
yeares neere that famous <hi>Scotchman</hi> Mr. <hi>John Forbes,</hi>
with whom I travelled into <hi>Germany,</hi> &amp; injoyed him
in much love and sweetnes constantly, from whom I
never had but incouragement though we differed in
the way of our Churches. Learned <hi>Amesius</hi> breathed
his last breath into my bosome, who left his profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorship
in <hi>Friezland</hi> to live with me because of my
Churches Independency at <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> and charged
me often, even to his death, so to look to it, and if
there were a way of publik worship in the world, that
God would owne it was that: he was my Colleague
and chosen Brother to the Church where I was
an unworthy Pastor: and I thanke the Lord such a
Church it continues to this day; that truely I sli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
tooke up nothing in that kind, nor did I los<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>
my seven years being in <hi>New England,</hi> amongst those
faithfull, learned, godly brethren, whose way of
worship if wee professe, it will not be groundlesse
when their Writings are examined. But to those
Printed Scribles against me I may provide shortly
a more satisfactory Answer, where I may plainly
charge home untrue and unworthy passages upon
the Authors; though I know, <hi>Et facere &amp; pati fortia
Christianorum est.</hi> Now the good Lord who hath led
Captivity captive for us, suodue us to himselfe, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:97028:8"/>
grant that in these tossing, tumbling, foaming Seas
we depart not from our Principles of Reason, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,
