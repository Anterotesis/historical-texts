            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that <hi>H. N.</hi> (Gods chosen Minister) and his

censured with several false judgements,
by many false hearts, and <hi>good-thinking</hi>
wise-ones, by many false Christians, and
unsent Teachers, or Preachers, and by some
unfaithfull and opinionated self-seekers,
who are turned away from us. And that
the Godly Testimonies of the holy Spirit of
the Love of <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> (published by <hi>H. N.</hi>
were by many disgracefully contemned

in regard of the Love which I bear and have
to all mens salvation, I could not omit to

believe the Truth, understand the Godly
Testimonies of the holy Spirit of Love, and
may be preserved in these dangerous times)
and to witnesse the Truth before them, how

the days of <hi>Maximilian</hi> the first, being

it fell out on an Evening in a Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

(with many words,) That they should

               <p>2 The same time, The Lord ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

what is that singular Grace bestowed on
us, for which we ought to give praise

               <p>3 When the child had asked this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

reconciled us to his Father<note n="d" place="margin">Rom. 5. b. Col. 2. b.</note> and hath

Grace, which God, bestowed on
us, to the laud and praise of his great
Power.</p>
               <p>5 Then said the child, O my Father,
I doe read indeed of the sufferings of our
Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> and I heare it daily
testified in Sermons, that God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath bestowed on us his great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
and that his beloved Sonne <hi>Jesus
Christ</hi> hath suffered the ignominious
death of the Crosse by reason of sinne<note n="g" place="margin">Mat. 27. Rom. 5. a. 1 Pet. 2. c.</note>
but I finde not according to Truth, that
the sinne is amended in us, nor that the
true righteousness<note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 1. e. 2. b.</note> (wherein <hi>Adam</hi>
was created and placed) is restored in us
or set up again.</p>
               <p>6 Then said the Father, Oh my sonne,
what I have told you about the grace of
God shewed to us through <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi>
you need not to doubt of it, beleeve the
same in simpleness of heart, and, that it
all is come to passe as I have told you.</p>
               <p>7 Then said the child, O my Father <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
I make no question of the mercy of
God, which is come unto us through <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
Christ,</hi> and all that which is preached
to us of Christ, and his satisfaction for
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6553:8"/>
the sinne, as that he (through the death
on the Crosse) hath prepared and obtein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for us<note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 1, c. Eph. 5. c.</note> the Salvation from the

Christ</hi> (for to bring us againe in all

hath prepared the way for us, that we
might obtein the same.</p>
               <p>8 For I understand (out of the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of Christ,) That <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> is
preached unto us (in his Gospel) to such
an end, that we should beleeve in him,<note n="n" place="margin">John 3. b.</note>
and should obediently<note n="o" place="margin">Heb. 5. b. 12. a 1 Pet. 1. 5.</note> follow him in

with the spiritual &amp; heavenly goods,
the (which as it stands to me in my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding)
is the same Grace and Mercy
of God, which is come unto us through
<hi>Jesus Christ:</hi> So I cannot conceive, that
it is any otherwise brought again, or shall
be restored: which was lost through the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:6553:8"/>
fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> or that we have missed by
reason of <hi>Adams</hi> sinne.</p>
               <p>9 For as I have heard preached in the
Church, that the Worke of God, which
he did make in the beginning, and also
the man<note n="q" place="margin">Gen. 1. c. Wisd. 2. c. Ecclus 17. a.</note> when he created him, was
perfect, between which perfect worke of
God, there came in a breach or rent
through the sinne<note n="r" place="margin">Gen. 3. b.</note> whereby the man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
is turn'd off from his God, and is
wholly<note n="s" place="margin">Ephes. 4. b.</note> estranged from his upright
manly estate, and from the union with
his God.</p>
               <p>10 Now if all this same shall be resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>
again, then that which was torn
and broken, must be<note n="t" place="margin">Ezech. 34. c.</note> joyned together
again, and the man, with all that God
hath made and ordained, (even as it was
in the beginning) must be set againe in
his upright<note n="u" place="margin">Gen. 1. c.</note> forme and order, which we
see now plainly and perceive, that the
same is not yet come to passe, or accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished
in us; Therefore it appeareth alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
(in my understanding,) That God
for the bringing again of the man into
his upright being, &amp; that the repentance
or satisfaction for our sins, must have
another performance, and fulfilling, then
many men suppose or conceive.</p>
               <p>11 Then the Father mervailed much
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:6553:9"/>
at the distinct expressions of the child, and
said, O my son, hold they self iu silence, lest
you dig too deep into the works of God.
I will relate the matter to our spiritually
learned (which are our advisers)<note n="*" place="margin">or instructers</note> they shall
well instruct thee therein (to the belt) for
I my selfe, doe not understand this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness,
nor thou neither as I suppose, and
besides, thou art yet too much young to be
able to comprehend such things, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let us hearken to our Advisers, and
simply beleeve them herein.</p>
               <p>12 Then said the child, Father it is
well, let it be so, I submit my selfe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
to your authority, and so in that
evening) there was no more talke of
it.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> 13 But all the night after the Father
was much perplexed with the sayings of
his young sonne. And (being of himselfe
plaine and simple) went the next day to
the Minorie-brethren to his Confessor
(for he thought in his judgement that
these brethren of the Minories (which
were called also the Observators) were the
most holy and most judicious in the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
things and able to give good instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to him and his sonne) and intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to his Confessor (confiding in him

               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:6553:9"/>
14 And his Confessor gave to him
this answer, That he should bring his
sonne to him, then he would take to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
a good brother, and would resolve
them of all these matters.</p>
               <p>15 The Father did according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of his Confessor, and at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient
time he went with his young
sonne <hi>H. N.</hi> to the Minorie-brethren,
That both of them (the Father and the

               <p>NOw when both of these came to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/>
the Confessor of the Father of <hi>H.
N,</hi> then the Confessor looked on the
child, which was very young and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and said to the Father, Is that
the lad thou told'st me of. That hath such
strange whimses in his head? Surely,
he is to childish yet, as to trouble himself
with such things as you told me of.
Thou shouldest of right (with a rod) cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stise
him from the same, &amp; neither to hear
nor answer him in his sayings, for it is
not otherwise then the madness of a
child.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:6553:10"/>
2 Then said the Child, hold there Sir,
why do you speak forth such words? It
is true that I am yet young and childish,
and am still under the Rod and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
of my Father, and stand under his
doctrine and instruction, And if my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(at his convenient time) doth instruct
me, And I cannot conceive or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
(in my apprehension of my Fathers
saying, should it not be granted or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
me to aske for the sense and true
meaning thereof?</p>
               <p>3 When the Confessor observed the
Lad's so modestly answeared him, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to be somewhat moved in himself;
And answered then to the child more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly,
and said, yea, in truth my sonne
it behoveth, you indeed, to aske what
the right understanding is, but you are
yet much too young and too small of capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
to search into the<note n="a" place="margin">S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> 4 Then said the Child because I am
young and of a small understanding in
the mysteries of divine matters, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
am I the more inclined for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to aske, and not to search thereafter
out of my owne power, but desire to be
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6553:10"/>
instructed and taught therein (from my
youth) of my Elders and Teachers.</p>
               <p>5 Then said the Confessor it is well
done my sonue if you keepe there, but me
thinketh, that thou makest a doubt, (as thy
father informeth me) of the satisfaction
of <hi>Christ,</hi> for the transgression of <hi>Adam</hi>
and for all our sins.</p>
               <p>6 Then said the childe: no Sir, thereof
I doubt not: but my saying is, that I do
plainly see,<note n="b" place="margin">Rom 6. 8. a.</note> That the satisfaction in
<hi>Christ</hi> for our redemption or deliverance
from the sinue, (for which <hi>Christ</hi> suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
death on the Crosse<note n="c" place="margin">Rom. 6. a. Phil 2. a. Heb. 5. 9. b. 12. a.</note> and made satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction)
is not performed as yet in us,
and that we have not followed <hi>Christ</hi> in
his Passeover to his Father, and if I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eeive
this, and find it to be so. Is it ill
done that I akse whether the satisfaction
or the upright fruits of repentance be still
owing, or how<note n="d" place="margin">Luke 1. 8. Eph. 1. a. Col. 1. b.</note> we shall be delivered
from the sinnes, and be brought to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
righteousnesse?</p>
               <p>7 And when I inquiring after this, and
likewise have and hope that it be performed
in us, and that the righteousness in which
<hi>Adam</hi> was created and set into shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
unto us, and that we also shall be
delivered from the fall and transgressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of <hi>Adam,</hi> this is (I hope) no doubt of
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:6553:11"/>
Christ satisfaction, but I may iustly
doubt of our satisfaction; for I conceive
in my understandings, that we are still
indebted to God concerning our satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in <hi>Jesus Christ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> 8 Then said the Confessor, O my
sonne thou runnest out too far with thy
young understanding, for after that, thou
mayest not search so deepe, nor no man
else, but simply beleeve all that concerneth
<hi>Christ</hi> and our salvation.</p>
               <p>9 Then said the child, well Sir, I will
simply beleeve all as you say, yet must I
aske somthing of thee out of my simplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
&amp; desire for the love of <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> that
thou wouldest answer to my simple que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion.</p>
               <p>10 Then said the Confessor, well my
sonne, aske and I will answer thee.</p>
               <p>11 Then said the child. if <hi>Adam</hi> had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
simply according to the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of God, and had not falne off
from God, &amp; had not transgressed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of God, should then he, and we, have
lived, in the sinne or in the righteousnes?</p>
               <p>12 The Confessor said, <hi>Adam</hi> and we
all should have lived eternally in the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousness,
and no sin nor<note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 2. a. Sap. 1. b.</note> death should
have reigned over us.</p>
               <p>13 Furthermore the child asked and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:6553:11"/>
said, when God created Heaven and Earth
and all that is therein<note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 1. c. 2. a</note> and the man al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so,
whom he made after his owne Image,
did not God then make all chings good

would have it?</p>
               <p>14 The Confessor said O, yea, my son,
<note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 1. 2.</note> what ever God hath made, he made
it well, and good, and all what God said
and<note n="h" place="margin">Psal. 32. b. 140. a. John 1. a.</note> commanded to be, it stood there

               <p>15 Then said the child, Seeing the man <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/>

should with these matters (if he be let a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone)
bring himselfe into weaknesse of

he be punished for these things, and make

               <p>7 I hoped indeed for the help of man:

in my trouble, for the proud have lifted up

unto me an early ripe Grape.</p>
               <p>14 My heart rejoyced in the wisdome,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/>
and I went presently in her way: and thus
from my youth I sought after her.</p>
               <p>15 I hearkned, and inclined my ears af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
her, and took her to me, or united me
with her.</p>
               <p>16 Then found I much wisdome, and
through her I increase greatly, and praised
him who gave me wisdome.</p>
               <p>17 I was resolved to do accordingly,
and to endeavour carefully after the good:
and I was not there at ashamed.</p>
               <p>18 I wrested there after with all my
heart, and was diligent to do accordingly.</p>
               <p>19 I lifted up my hands to Heaven, and
my soul was enlightned through the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?

               <p>20 I ordered my heart to wisdome, and
found her pure in all things: and I joyned
in all things: and I joyned my heart with
her, even from the beginning.</p>
               <p>21 Therefore shall I not be forsaken, for

               <p>5 There was also figured forth, unto

               <p>7 And therefore, that we might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

all the fourth six dayes of our journey,
wee most humbly besought the Lord (in

according to the good-think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of men: And thus we came on the
fourth sixth day into a <hi>Straightness,</hi> in
which Straightnesse we perceived that the
way to the upright life (which men goe

which are turned to themselves, and have
placed their love and pleasure upon their

               <p>19 Notwithstanding that we full well
perceiving that to pass through the
straightness is an narrow Gate, and
small Path, yet wee feared not its pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage:
but instantly betook our selves to
a good observation, namely,<note n="x" place="margin">Mat. 26. Luke 12 d.</note> 
                  <hi>Heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>

               </p>
               <p>20 Of this heaviness of heart, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:6553:61"/>
perplexednesse of mind, for to pass through
the way unto the life uprightly, we were
(in our sighing and praying to the Lord)
very willingly received: and obteined of
them a good promise to our comfort. For

told (to our comfort) that we should in no

               <p>25 Of the forgetting of all that which

were in all friendly manner received: and
uprightly endevoring us, in the forgetting

totally to forget it all, that which
men are to forsake in respect of the good (or
