            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is a great diſtance, betwixt the vulgar opinion of men, and the iudicious apprehenſion of wiſe men. Opinion is as blind <hi>Oedipus,</hi> who could ſee nothing, but would heare all things, <hi>Hinc aucupari verba ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moris vagi,</hi> to hawke after the winged report of a vagabond rumor. But iudgement, is as <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in his throne, able by the ſpirit of wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to diſcerne betwixt <hi>conteſting</hi> truth, and falſhood: neither depending on the popular breath of fame, which is euer partiall, nor vpon the euent of good deſignes, which are euer ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuall. Theſe two commanders of our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, haue diuided the vniuerſall ſpirits of our land, whilſt (in the honorable enterpriſe for
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:23153:3"/>
plantation in <hi>Virginia)</hi> ſome, are caried away with the tide of vulgar opinion, and others, are encouraged, by the principles of religion, and reaſon. But becauſe, it is for hawkes and not for men, to build their neſts in aires, and becauſe the honor and proſperity of this ſo noble an action, is eclipſed by the interpoſition of clamorous &amp; tragicall narrations: the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler of this relation endeuoureth to waſh away thoſe ſpots, which foule mouths (to iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie their owne diſloialty) haue caſt vpon ſo fruitfull, ſo fertile, and ſo excellent a country. Wherein he profeſſeth, that he will relate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing (concerning <hi>Virginia)</hi> but what he hath from the ſecrets of the iudiciall councell of <hi>Virginia,</hi> from the letters of the Lord <hi>La Ware,</hi> from the mouth of Sir <hi>Thomas Gates,</hi> whoſe wiſedomes (he conceiueth) are not ſo ſhallow, as eaſily to be deceiued <hi>of others,</hi> nor conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſo wretched, as by pretences to deceiue others.</p>
            <p>But when a matter of ſuch conſequence, is not to be ſhufled ouer with ſupine negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and when no man raiſeth a faire buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that laith not a firme foundation, it will
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:23153:3"/>
not be impertinent, to dig a little deeper, that we may build a great deale higher: and from the vniuerſall policie of all ciuill ſtates (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhing the world with colonies of dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall ſubiects) to deriue this wiſedome to our populous ſtate and country.</p>

Now if <hi>Tertullians</hi> rule be true, <hi>Omne genus ab origine cenſendum</hi> that euery action is moſt beutifull in the originall. Can there be a better beginning then from God, whoſe wiſedome is not queſtioned, and whoſe footſteps in all ſucceeding ages haue beene followed. Search the records of diuine truth, and humane monuments of ſtate, you ſhall find, <hi>Salmanaſar</hi> tranſporting the Babilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,

            </p>
            <p>You ſhall find that 140. yeeres after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Troy</hi> the <hi>Ionian</hi> colony, was carried from <hi>Greece,</hi> to <hi>Aſia:</hi> by which that famous Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was firſt builded, and inhabited.

vndertaken by ſo mighty ſtates and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, vpon triuiall and vulgar motiues, when by theſe courſes that firſt bleſſing (of <hi>creſcite</hi> and <hi>multiplicamini,</hi> increaſe and multiplie) hath beene ſanctified: the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſorte haue beene prouided: the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of plagues, famine and ſedition, hath beene exhauſted: the fennes of a ſtate politique were drained: the enemies of their peace were bridled: the reuenues of their treaſury were augmented: and the limites of their dominions were enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.</p>
            <p>Which diuine, humane, externall, and domeſticall, examples, doe ſhine before vs, as a <hi>Pharaoes</hi> towre, that wee ſhould not make ſhipwracke of our intentions, concerning <hi>Virginia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Blacke enuie, and pale feare, being not able to produce any arguments, why that ſhould bee lawfull for <hi>France,</hi> which is (in vs) vnlawfull: that which to <hi>Rome</hi> was poſſible, (to vs) is impoſſible: that which to others is honourable, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:23153:5"/>
(in vs) ſhould bee traduced, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodious, baſe, and contemptible: <note place="margin">Three Heads. Lawfull, Poſſible, Profitable.</note>wherefore vnder theſe three heads of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, poſſibility, and commoditie, will I marſhall all thoſe reaſons, which may reſolue the religious, encourage the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall, confirme the noble, and ſatiſfie the timorous aduenturer.</p>
            <p>Firſt, if it bee vnlawfull: it muſt be ſo, either in reſpect of the law of God, or in regard of the lawe of man. If in reſpect of Gods lawe, (conſidering our primarie end is to plant religion, our ſecondarie and ſubalternate ends are for the honour and profit of our nation) I demand a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of this plaine queſtion: whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bee not a determinated truth, that the Goſpell ſhould bee preached, to all the world, before the end of the world? If, it muſt bee preached, (as heauen and earth muſt paſſe awaie, but Gods word ſhall not paſſe awaie) then muſt it bee preached, one of theſe three waies: Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meerly Apoſtolically, without the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:23153:5"/>
helpe of man, (without ſo much as a ſtaffe (or meerely imperiallie, when a Prince, hath conquered their bodies, that the Preachers may feede their ſoules; Or mixtly, by diſcouerie, and trade of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants; where all temporall meanes are vſed for defence, and ſecurity, but none for offence, or crueltie. For the firſt (to preach Apoſtolicallie) it is ſimplie impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: except wee had the gift of tongues, that euerie nation might heare the word of God in their owne language; or the guift of miracles, that it might be confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, with wonders from heauen; which two beeing ceaſed, queſtionleſſe the iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall commiſſion of the Apoſtles is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired: Or if yet the matter bee vrged, that God by fiſhers did conuert Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and therefore that wee muſt aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture our liues without humane helpe; yet muſt it bee remembred, that there is no Apoſtolicall preaching, but where wee may expect eitheir their conuerſion, or our martyrdome. But we can expect nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:23153:6"/>
not their conuerſion who cannot vnderſtand vs, nor our martyrdome, when the people of <hi>Florida,</hi> did deuoure the Preachers of the word, without ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any word. <hi>Non quia Chriſtiani, ſed quia homines,</hi> not becauſe they were chriſtian men, but becauſe they were men, wee cannot be ſaid to be martyrs, when wee are not killed becauſe wee are chriſtians. And therefore the Ieſuite <hi>Acoſta</hi> confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth (notwithſtanding <hi>Bellarmines</hi> relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Indian miracles) that they haue no tongues, they haue no ſignes from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and they can haue no martyrdome, and by conſequent there is no meanes left of Apoſtolicall preaching.</p>
            <p>For the ſecond, to preach the Goſpell to a nation conquered, and to ſet their ſoules at liberty, when we haue brought their bodies to ſlauerie; It may be a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſacred in the Preachers, but I know not how iuſtifiable in the rulers. Who for their meere ambition, doe ſet vpon it, the gloſſe of religion. Let the diuines of <hi>Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manca,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:23153:6"/>
diſcuſſe that queſtion, how the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of the weſt Indies, firſt deſtroied, and then inſtructed.</p>
            <p>The third, belongs to vs, who by way of marchandizing and trade, doe buy of them the pearles of earth, and ſell to them the pearles of heauen; which action, if it be vnlawfull, it muſt proceede from one of theſe three grounds, either becauſe we come to them, or trade with them, or tarrie and dwell and poſſeſſe part of their country amongſt them.</p>
            <p>Is it vnlawfull becauſe wee come to them? why is it not a dutie of chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, to behold the imprinted footſteps of Gods glorie, in euery region vnder hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen? Is it not againſt the lawe of nations, to violate a peaceable ſtranger, or to denie him harbour. The Ethiopians, Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and men of <hi>China,</hi> are branded with a foule marke of ſanguinarie and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inhumanity, for bleſſing their Idols, with the bloud of ſtrangers. It is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull to trade with them, except <hi>Salomon</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:23153:7"/>
ſhall bee condemned for ſending for gold to <hi>Ophir, Abraham</hi> for making a league with <hi>Abimelech,</hi> and all chriſtendome ſhall bee traduced, for hauing comerce with Turks and miſcreants.</p>
            <p>Finallie, it is not vnlawfull, that wee poſſeſſe part of their land, and dwell with them, and defend our ſelues from them. Partlie becauſe there is no other, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and mixt courſe, to bring them to conuerſion, but by dailie conuerſation, where they may ſee the life, and learne the language each of other.</p>
            <p>Partlie, becauſe there is no truſt to the fidelitie of humane beaſts, except a man will make a league, with Lions, Beares, and Crocodiles.</p>
            <p>Partlie becauſe there is roome ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in the land (as <hi>Sichem</hi> ſometime ſaid) for them, and vs: the extent of an hundred miles, being ſcarce peopled with 2000. inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Partlie, becauſe they haue violated the lawe of nations, and vſed our Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors

            <p>To the third, he briefly ſignifieth, that no

other Commiſsioners were in his Ship, but ſuch, (as for eſpeciall reaſons) were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely and peremptorily appointed, by the Councell of <hi>Virginia.</hi> And thus you ſee, that <hi>Tacitus</hi> wiſely obſerued two great ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of great actions, <hi>Ignorantiam veri, &amp; Inuidiam,</hi> the ignorance of Truth, and the emulation of Vertue.</p>
            <p>To returne therefore vnto the maine channell of this diſcourſe, and to diſpell the clouds of feare, that threaten ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks, and ſea-dangers: For we are not to extenuate the ſeas tempeſtuous vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, nor yet therefore to diſpaire of Gods aſsiſting prouidence. For true it is, that when <hi>Sir Thomas Gates, Sir George Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,</hi> and <hi>Captaine Newport,</hi> were in the height of 27. and the 24. of Iuly 1609. there aroſe ſuch a ſtorme, as if <hi>Ionas</hi> had been flying vnto <hi>Tarshiſh:</hi> the heauens were obſcured, and made an Egyptian night of three daies perpetuall horror; the women lamented; the hearts of the paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers failed; the experience of the ſea Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:23153:13"/>
was amaſed: the skill of the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners was confounded: the Ship moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently leaked, and though two thouſand tunne of water by pumping from Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day noone till Fryday noone was diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, notwithſtanding the Ship was halfe filled with water, and thoſe which labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to keepe others from drowning were halfe drowned themſelues in labouring. But God that heard <hi>Ionas</hi> crying out of the belly of hell, he pittied the diſtreſſes of his ſeruants: For behold, in the laſt period of neceſsitie, <hi>Sir George Summers</hi> deſcryed land, which was by ſo much the more ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, by how much their danger was deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairefull. The Iſlands on which they <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ell were the <hi>Bermudos,</hi> a place hardly acceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, through the inuironing rocks and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: notwithſtanding they were forced to runne their Ship on ſhoare, which through Gods prouidence fell betwixt two rockes, that cauſed her to ſtand firme and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to be broken, God continuing his mercie vnto them, that with their long
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:23153:13"/>
Boats they tranſported to land before night, all their company, men, women, and children, to the number of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fiftie, they carryed to ſhoare all the prouiſion of vnſpent and vnſpoyled victuals, all their furniture and tackling of the Ship, leauing nothing but bared ribs, as a pray vnto the Ocean.</p>
            <p>Theſe Iſlands of the <hi>Bermudos,</hi> haue euer beene accounted as an inchaunted pile of rockes, and a deſert inhabitation for Diuels; but all the Fairies of the rocks were but flocks of birds, and all the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uels that haunted the woods, were but heards of ſwine. Yea and when <hi>Acoſta</hi> in his firſt booke of the hyſtories of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> auerreth, that though in the continent there were diuerſe beaſts, and cattell, yet in the Iſlands of <hi>Hiſpaniola, Iamaica, Margua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rita,</hi> and <hi>Dominica,</hi> there was not one hoofe, it increaſeth the wonder, how our people in the <hi>Bermudos</hi> found ſuch abundance of Hogs, that for nine moneths ſpace they plentifully ſufficed: and yet the number ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:23153:14"/>
not much diminiſhed. Again, as in the great famine of <hi>Iſraell,</hi> God commanded <hi>Elias</hi> to flie to the brooke <hi>Cedron,</hi> and there fed him by Rauens; ſo God prouided for our diſconſolate people in the midſt of the Sea by foules: but with an admirable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: vnto <hi>Elias</hi> the Rauens brought meat, vnto our men the foules brought (themſelues) for meate: for when they whiſteled, or made any ſtrange noyſe, the foules would come and ſit on their ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, they would ſuffer themſelues to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and weighed by our men, who would make choiſe of the fatteſt and faireſt, and let flie the leane and lighteſt. An accident, I take it, that cannot be paralleld by any Hyſtorie, except when God ſent abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Quayles to feed his <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the barren wilderneſſe. Laſtly they found the berries of <hi>Cedar,</hi> the <hi>Palmeto</hi> tree, the prickle peare, ſufficient fiſh, plentie of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toiſes, and diuers others kinds, which ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to ſuſtaine nature. They found diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of woods, which miniſtred materials
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:23153:14"/>
for the building of two Pinaces, according to the direction of the three prouident Gouernours.</p>
            <p>Conſider all theſe things together. At the inſtant of neede, they deſcryed land, halfe an hower more, had buried their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial in the Sea. If they had fel by night, what expectation of light, from an vninha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited deſart? They fell betwixt a laberinth of rockes, which they conceiue are moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred into the Sea, by thunder and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. This was not <hi>Ariadnes</hi> threed, but the direct line of Gods prouidence. If it had not beene ſo neere land, their companie or prouiſion had periſhed by water: if they had not found Hogs, and foule, and fiſh, they had periſhed by famine: if there had not beene fuell, they had periſhed by want of fire: if there had not beene timber they could not haue tranſported them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to <hi>Virginia,</hi> but muſt haue beene for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten foreuer. <hi>Nimium timet qui Deo non credit,</hi> he is too impiouſly fearefull, that will not truſt in God ſo powerfull.</p>

What is there in all this tragicall Comae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die that ſhould diſcourage vs with impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie of the enterpriſe? when of all the Fleete, one onely Ship, by a ſecret leake was indangered, and yet in the gulfe of deſpaire, was ſo graciouſly preſerued. <hi>Quae videtur poena, eſt medicina,</hi> that which we accompt a puniſhment of euill, is but a medicine againſt euill.</p>
            <p>After nine Moneths aboade in theſe Iſlands, on the tenth of May 1610. they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barqued themſelues in their two new built Pinaces, and after ſome eleuen daies ſaile, they arriued neere point Comfort vpon the coaſt of <hi>Virginia:</hi> where they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of ſo wofull miſerie, as if God had onely preſerued them, to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate in an new extremitie.</p>
            <p>From which calamitie, the other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of impoſsibilitie are framed; For if the Countrie bee barren, or the ſcituation contagious; as famine, and ſickneſſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy our Nation: wee ſtriue againſt the ſtreame of reaſon, and make our ſelues the

            <p>Howſoeuer, men haue belyed both it and themſelues, heretofore, yet let no rumor of the Countrie (as if in the wombe thereof lay not theſe elementall ſeedes of plenty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe) waue any mans faire purpoſes, or wreſt them to a declyning and falling off from the buſineſſe.</p>

               <note place="margin">Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> For the healthineſſe and temperateneſſe of the Clymate, agreeing to our conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, much neede not be related, ſince in all the former written Treatiſes, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:23153:18"/>
obſerued.</p>
            <p>No man ought to judge of any Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie by the fennes and marſhes (ſuch as is the place where <hi>James</hi> towne ſtandeth) except we will condemne all England, for the Wilds and Hundreds of Kent and Eſſex. In our particular, wee haue an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible proofe of the temper of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie: for of an hundred and odd, which were ſeated at the <hi>Falles,</hi> vnder the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of <hi>Captaine Francis Weſt,</hi> and of an hundred to the Sea-ward on the South ſide of the riuer, (in the Countrie of the <hi>Nanſamunds)</hi> vnder the charge of <hi>Captaine Iohn Martin;</hi> of all theſe two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, there did not ſo much as one man miſcarrie: when in <hi>Iames</hi> Towne, at the ſame time, and in the ſame moneths, 100. ſickned, and halfe the number died.</p>
            <p>The like experiment was long ſince in the regiment of <hi>Sir Raph Lane,</hi> where, in the ſpace of one whole yeare, not two of one hundred periſhed. Adde vnto this the diſcourſe of philoſophie, when in that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:23153:18"/>
Countrie fleſh will receiue ſalt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue vnputrified (which it will not in the Weſt Indies) when the moſt delicate of all flowers, grow there as familiarly, as in the fields of <hi>Portingale,</hi> where the woods are repleniſhed with more ſweet barks, and odors, then they are in the pleſanteſt places of <hi>Florida.</hi> How is it poſsible that ſuch a virgin and temperat aire, ſhould work ſuch contrarie effects, but becauſe our fort (that lyeth as a ſemy-Iland) is moſt part inuiro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with an ebbing and flowing ſalt water, the owze of which ſendeth forth an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholſome &amp; contagious vapour? To cloſe vp this part with <hi>Sir Thomas Gates</hi> his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment: he profeſſeth, that in a fortnights ſpace he recouered the health of moſt of them by moderat labour, whoſe ſickneſſe was bred in them by intemperate idlenes.</p>
            <p>If any man ſhall accuſe theſe reports of partiall falſhood, ſuppoſing them to be but Vtopian, and legendarie fables, becauſe he cannot conceiue, that plentie and famine, a temperate climate, and diſtempered bodies,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:23153:19"/>
felicities, and miſeries can be reconciled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, let him now reade with judgement, but let him not judge before he hath read.</p>
            <p>The ground of all thoſe miſeries, was the permiſsiue prouidence of God, who, in the fore-mentioned violent ſtorme, ſeperated the head from the bodie, all the vitall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of regiment being exiled with <hi>Sir Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Gates</hi> in thoſe infortunate (yet fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate) Ilands. The broken remainder of thoſe ſupplies made a greater ſhipwrack in the continent of <hi>Virginia,</hi> by the tempeſt of diſſention: euery man ouervaluing his own worth, would be a Commander: euery man vnderpriſing an others value, denied to be commanded. The emulation of <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> watered the plains of <hi>Pharſaly</hi> with bloud, and diſtracted the ſinewes of the Romane <hi>Monarchy.</hi> The diſſentions of the three beſieged Captains betraied the Citie of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> to <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi> how much more eaſily might ambitious diſcord teare in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces an infant Colony, where no eminent and reſpected magiſtrats had authoritie to
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:23153:19"/>
puniſh preſumptuous diſobedience. <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> hath obſerued, that when <hi>Nero</hi> ſent his old trained ſouldiers to <hi>Tarantum</hi> and <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium,</hi> (but without their Captains and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turians) that they rather made a number, then a Colony: euery ſouldier ſecretly gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into ſome neighbour Prouince, and forſooke their appointed places: which hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched this conſequent miſchiefe; the Cities were vninhabited, and the emperour was fruſtrated: when therfore licence, ſedition, and furie, are the fruits of a headie, daring, and vnruly multitude, it is no wonder that ſo many in our colony periſhed: it is a wonder, that all were not deuoured. <hi>Omnis inordinatus animus ſibi ipſi fit poena,</hi> euery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate ſoule becomes his owne puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The next fountaine of woes was ſecure negligence, and improuidence, when euery man ſharked for his preſent bootie but was altogether careleſſe of ſucceeding penurie. Now, I demand whether <hi>Sicilia,</hi> or <hi>Sardinia,</hi> (ſometimes the barnes of <hi>Rome)</hi> could hope
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:23153:20"/>
for increaſe without manuring? A Colony is therefore denominated, becauſe they ſhould be <hi>Coloni,</hi> the tillers of the earth, and ſtewards of fertilitie: our mutinous loiterers would not ſow with prouidence, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they reaped the fruits of too deare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bought repentance. An incredible example of their idlenes, is the report of <hi>Sir Thomas Gates,</hi> who affirmeth, that after his firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming thither, he hath ſeen ſome of them eat their fiſh raw, rather than they would go a ſtones caſt to fetch wood and dreſſe it. <hi>Dij laboribus omnia vendunt,</hi> God ſels vs all things for our labour, when <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe might not liue in paradice without dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the garden.</p>
            <p>Vnto idleneſſe, you may ioyne treaſons, wrought by thoſe vnhallowed creatures that forſooke the Colony, and expoſed their deſolate brethren to extreame miſerie. You ſhall know that 28. or 30. of the companie, were appointed (in the Ship called the Swallow) to truck for Corne with the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and hauing obtained a great quantitie
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:23153:20"/>
by trading, the moſt ſeditious of them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired together, perſuaded ſome, &amp; enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced others, to this barbarous proiect. They ſtole away the Ship, they made a league a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelues to be profeſſed pirates, with dreames of mountaines of gold, and happy robberies: thus at one inſtant, they wronged the hopes, and ſubuerted the cares of the Colony, who depending vpon their returne, fore-ſlowed to looke out for further prouiſion: they created the <hi>Indians</hi> our implacable enemies by ſome violence they had offered: they carried away the beſt Ship (which ſhould haue been a refuge, in extremities:) they weakned our forces, by ſubſtraction of their armes, and ſuccours. Theſe are that ſcum of men that fayling in their piracy, that beeing pinched with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and penurie, after their wilde rouing vpon the Sea, when all their lawleſſe hopes failed, ſome remained with other pirates, they men vpon the Sea, the others reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to returne for England, bound them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by mutuall oath, to agree all in one
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:23153:21"/>
report, to diſcredit the land, to deplore the famyne, and to proteſt that this their comming awaie, proceeded from deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate neceſſitie: Theſe are they, that roared out the tragicall hiſtorie of the man eating of his dead wife in <hi>Virginia;</hi> when the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of this Ship willingly confeſſed before 40 witneſſes, that at their comming awaie, they left three moneths victuals, and all the cattell liuing in the Fort: ſometimes they reported that they ſaw this horrible action, ſometimes that <hi>Captaine Dauies</hi> ſayd ſo, ſometimes that one <hi>Beadle</hi> the Lieutenant of <hi>Captaine Dauies</hi> did relate it, varying this report into diuerſitie of falſe colours, which hold no likeneſſe and proportion: But to cleare all doubts, <hi>Sir Thomas Gates</hi> thus relateth the tragedie.</p>
            <q>
               <p>There was one of the companie who mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally hated his wife, and therefore ſecretly kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her, then cut her in pieces and hid her in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers parts of his houſe: when the woman was miſſing, the man ſuſpected, his houſe ſearched, and parts of her mangled body were diſcoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:23153:21"/>
to excuſe himſelfe he ſaid that his wife died, that hee hid her to ſatisfie his hunger, and that he fed daily vpon her. Vpon this, his houſe was againe ſearched, where they found a good quantitie of meale, oatemeale, beanes and peaſe. Hee thereupon was araigned, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the murder, and was burned for his hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible villany.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Now ſhall the ſcandalous reports of a viperous generation, preponderate the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of ſo worthie leaders? ſhall their venemous tongues, blaſt the reputation of an auncient &amp; worthy Peere, who vpon the ocular certainty of future bleſsings, hath proteſted in his Letters, that he will ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice himſelfe for his Countrie in this ſeruice, if he may be ſeconded; and if the company doe giue it ouer he will yet lay all his fortunes vpon the proſecution of the plantation? ſhall ſworne lyes, and combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned oathes, ſo far priuiledge trechery, and piracy as to rob vs of our hopes, &amp; to quell our noble reſolutions? God forbid: <hi>Qui in mendacio confidit, cito diffidit,</hi> a lyers confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:23153:22"/>
is but a blazing diffidence.</p>
            <p>Vnto Treaſons, you may ioyne coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſſe in the Mariners, who for their priuate lucre partly imbezeled the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, partly preuented our trade with the <hi>Indians,</hi> making the matches in the night, and foreſtalling our market in the day: whereby the Virginians were glutted with our trifles, and inhaunced the prices of their Corne and Victuall. That Copper which before would haue prouided a bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhell, would not now obtaine ſo much as a pottle: <hi>Non habet euentus ſordida praeda bonos,</hi> the conſequent of ſordid gaine is vntimely wretchedneſſe.</p>
            <p>Ioyne vnto theſe an other euill: there is great ſtore of Fiſh in the riuer, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of Sturgeon; but our men prouided no more of them, then for preſent neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, not barrelling vp any ſtore againſt that ſeaſon the Sturgeon returned to the ſea. And not to diſſemble their folly, they ſuffered fourteene nets (which was all they had) to rot and ſpoile, which by orderly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:23153:22"/>
drying and mending might haue been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued: but being loſt, all help of fiſhing periſhed. <hi>Quanto maiora timentur diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia, tanto promptior debet eſſe cautela,</hi> fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall loſſes that cannot be repealed, ought with the greateſt caution to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of the Colony, by theſe acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents began to find a ſenſible declyning: which <hi>Powhatan</hi> (as a greedy Vulture) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing, and boyling with deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenge, he inuited <hi>Captaine Ratclife,</hi> and about thirty others to trade for Corne, and vnder the colour of faireſt friendſhip, he brought them within the compaſſe of his ambuſh, whereby they were cruelly mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and maſſacred. For vpon confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his fidelitie, they went one and one into ſeuerall houſes, which cauſed their ſeuerall deſtructions, when if but any ſixe had remained together, they would haue been a bulwarke for the generall preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. After this, <hi>Powhatan</hi> in the night cut off ſome of our boats, he draue away all the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:23153:23"/>
Deere into the farther part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, hee and his people deſtroyed our Hogs, (to the number of about ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred) he ſent none of his <hi>Indians</hi> to trade with vs, but laied ſecret ambuſhes in the woods, that if one or two dropped out of the fort alone, they were indaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered.</p>
            <p>Caſt vp this reckoning together: want of gouernment, ſtore of idleneſſe, their expectations fruſtrated by the Traitors, their market ſpoyled by the Mariners, our nets broken, the deere chaſed, our boats loſt, our hogs killed, our trade with the <hi>Indians</hi> forbidden, ſome of our men fled, ſome murthered, and moſt by drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the brackiſh water of <hi>Iames</hi> fort weakened, and indaungered, famyne and ſickneſſe by all theſe meanes increaſed, here at home the monies came in ſo ſlowly, that the <hi>Lo. Laware</hi> could not be diſpatched, till the Colony was worne and ſpent with difficulties: Aboue all, hauing neither Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, nor Preacher, they neither feared God
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:23153:23"/>
nor man, which prouoked the wrath of the Lord of Hoſts, and pulled downe his iudgements vpon them. <hi>Diſcite iustitiam moniti.</hi> Now, (whether it were that God in mercie to vs would weede out theſe ranke hemlockes; or whether in iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them he would ſcourge their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieties; or whether in wiſedome he would trie our patience, <hi>Vt magna magnè deſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remus,</hi> that wee may beg great bleſsings earneſtly) our hope is that our Sunne ſhall not ſet in a cloude, ſince this violent ſtorme is diſperſed, ſince all neceſſarie things are prouided, an abſolute and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull gouernment is ſetled, as by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing relation ſhall be deſcribed.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Sir Thomas Gates</hi> arriued in <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia,</hi> the ſtrange and vnexpected condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wherein he found the Colony, gaue him to vnderſtand, how neuer was there more neede of all the powers of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then at this preſent; it being now his charge, both to ſaue ſuch as he found
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:23153:24"/>
ſo forlorne and wretched, as to redeeme himſelfe and his from fal ing into the like calamities. All which conſidered, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into conſultation with <hi>Sir George Summers,</hi> and <hi>Captaine Newport,</hi> and the Gentlemen and councell of the former gouernment. They examined firſt their ſtore, which after two cakes a day to a man, would hold out but ſixteene dayes, (it being fiue moneths betwixt the ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of the <hi>Swallow,</hi> and his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding) the Corne of the <hi>Indians</hi> but newly ſowed, not an eye of Sturgeon, as yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the riuer: And therefore at the ſame conſultation it was concluded by a generall approbation, That they ſhould abandon the Countrie, and in the foure Pinaces (which remained in the riuer) they ſhould make for the New found land, where (it beeing fiſhing time) they might meete with many Engliſh Ships, into which they hoped to diſperſe the moſt of the Company.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:23153:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
This concluſion taking effect, vpon the ſeuenth of Iune Sir <hi>Thomas Gates</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing appointed euery ſhip her comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and number, and deliuered like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to each a proportionable weight of prouiſion) cauſed euery man to repaire aboord; his company (and of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany himſelfe) remained laſt on ſhore, to keepe the towne from being burned, which ſome of our owne company mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly threatned. About noone they fell downe with the tyde to the Iland of Hogges, and the next morning to the Mulbury Iland: at what time, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered the long Boate of the Lord <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware,</hi> which his Lordſhip (hearing of this reſolution by the Captaine of the Fort, which ſtandeth at the mouth of the riuer) ſuddenly diſpatched with letters to Sir <hi>Thomas Gates,</hi> which informed him of his Lordſhips arriuall. Vpon receite of theſe letters, Sir <hi>Thomas Gates</hi> bore vp the Helme, and that night with a fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable winde relanded all our men at the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:23153:25"/>
Fort. Before which, the tenth of Iune (being Sunday) his Lordſhip came with all his Fleete, went aſhore in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, heard a Sermon, read his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion, and entred into conſultation for the good of the Colony.</p>
            <p>In which ſecret counſell, I will a little leaue his Lordſhip, that wee may duly obſerue the reuealed counſell of God. He that ſhal but turne vp his eye, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ſpangled Canopie of heauen, ſhall but caſt down his eye, and conſider the imbroidered Carpet of the earth, and withall ſhall marke, how the heauens heare the earth, the earth heare the corne and oyle, and they relieue the neceſsities of man, that man wil acknowledge Gods infinite prouidence. But hee that ſhall further obſerue, how God inclineth all caſuall euents, to worke the neceſſary helpe of his Saints, muſt needs adore the Lords infinite goodneſſe. Neuer had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny people more iuſt cauſe to caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues at the foot-ſtoole of God, and to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:23153:25"/>
reuerence his mercy, then our diſtreſſed Colony: for if God had not ſent Sir <hi>Thomas Gates</hi> from the Bermudos with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in foure daies, they had all beene famiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: if God had not directed the heart of that worthy Knight, to ſaue the Fort from fire at their ſhipping, they had been deſtitute of a preſent harbor, and ſuccor; if they had abandoned the Fort any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time, and had not ſo ſoone returned, queſtionleſſe the Indians would haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied the Fort, which had beene the meanes of our ſafety among them, and a terrour vnto them. If they had ſet Saile ſooner, and had lanched into the vaſt O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, who could haue promiſed, that they ſhould haue encountred the Fleet of the Lo. <hi>La-ware?</hi> eſpecially when they made for the New-found land, a courſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our Nauies approaching. If the Lord <hi>La-ware</hi> had not brought with him a yeares prouiſion, what comfort could thoſe ſoules haue receiued, to haue beene relanded to a ſecond deſtruction? <hi>Brachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:23153:26"/>
               <hi>Domini,</hi> this was thearme of the Lord of Hoſts, who would haue his people to paſſe the redde Sea and Wilderneſſe, and then to poſſeſſe the land of Canaan: It was diuinely ſpoken of heathen <hi>Socra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, Si Deus ſit ſolicitus prote, cur tu tibi ſis ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitus?</hi> if God for man be carefull, why ſhould man be ouer diſtruſtfull?</p>
            <p>The noble Lord gouernor, after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation, deliuered ſome few words to the company, laying iuſt blame vpon them for their haughty vanities, and ſluggiſh idleneſſe; earneſtly entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to amend thoſe deſperate fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, leſt he ſhould be compelled to draw the ſword of Iuſtice, and to cut off ſuch delinquents, which he had rather draw (euen to the ſhedding of his vital blood) to protect them from iniuries; heartning them with relation of that ſtore hee had brought with him; conſtituting officers of all conditions to rule ouer them, alot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting euery man his particular place to watch vigilantly and worke painefully.

This Oration and direction being recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with a generall applauſe, you might ſhortly behold the idle and reſtie diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of a diuided multitude, by the vnity and authority of this gouernment, to be ſubſtantially cured. Thoſe that knew not the way to goodnes before, but che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed ſingularity and faction, can now chalke out the path of all reſpectiue due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and ſeruice: euery man endeuouring to out-ſtrip each other in diligence: the French preparing to plant the Vines, the Engliſh labouring in the woods and groundes; euery man knoweth his charge, and diſchargeth the ſame with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacrity.

Nor ſhould it be conceiued, that this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines excludeth Gentlemen, whoſe bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding neuer knew what a daies labour meant; for though they cannot digge, vſe the ſquare, nor practiſe the axe and chizell; yet may the ſtayde ſpirits of any condition finde how to employ the force of knowledge, the exerciſe of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, the operation and power of their beſt breeding and qualities. The houſes which are built are as warme and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible againſt winde and weather, as if they were tiled and ſlated; being couered aboue with ſtrong boordes, and matted round within, according to the faſhion of the Indians. Our forces are now ſuch as are able to tame the fury and treachery of the Sauages: our Forts aſſure the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:23153:27"/>
and fruſtrate all aſſailants. And to leaue no diſcouragement in the heart of any, who perſonally ſhall enter into this great action, I will communicate a double comfort: firſt, Sir <hi>George Summers</hi> (that worthy Admiral) hath vndertaken a dangerous aduenture, for the good of the Colony.</p>
            <p>Vpon the fifteenth of Iune (accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with Captaine <hi>Samuel Argoll)</hi> he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in two Pinaces vnto the Bermu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dos; promiſing (if by any meanes God will open a way to that Iland of Rockes) that he would ſoone returne with ſixe moneths prouiſion of fleſh, and with liue Hogges to ſtore againe Virginia. It is but eleuen daies ſaile, and we hope that God will ſend a pillar of fire to direct his iourney. The other comfort is, that the Lord gouernour hath built two new Forts (the one called Fort <hi>Henry,</hi> and the other Fort <hi>Charles,</hi> in honor of our moſt noble Prince and his hopefull brother) vpon a pleaſant hill, and neere a little ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelet,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:23153:28"/>
which we call South<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>hampton ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. They ſtand in a wholſome ayre, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing plenty of ſprings of ſweete water; they command a great circuit of ground, containing wood, paſture and meadow; with apt places for vines, corne and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens. In which Forts it is reſolued, that all thoſe that come out of England ſhall be at their firſt landing quartered; that the weariſomnes of the ſea may bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed in this pleaſing part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
            <p>The fertility of the ſoile, the tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of the climate, the form of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the condition of our people, their daily inuocating of the name of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus expreſſed; Why ſhould the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe (by the rules of mortall iudgement) be deſpaired?

I dare ſay, that the reſolution of <hi>Caeſar</hi> in Fraunce, the deſignes of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> in Greece, the diſcoueries of <hi>Hernando Cortes</hi> in the Weſt, and of <hi>Emanuel,</hi> King

of Portugale in the Eaſt, were not incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged vpon ſo firme grounds of ſtate and poſsibility. All which I could demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate out of their owne Records, were I not preuented with haſt, to ſatisfie their longings, who with an open care, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken after the commodities of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: whoſe appetites I will no longer fruſtrate, then their eyes can runne ouer this ſuccinct Narration.</p>
            <p>I called it a ſuccinct Narration, becauſe the commodities in former Treatiſes haue beene largely deſcribed, which I will only here epitomiſe, leſt any man ſhould change his reſolution, when the ſame grounds remaine, which were the cauſe of his former aduenture.</p>
            <p>The Councell of Virginia (finding the ſmalneſſe of that returne, which they hoped ſhould haue defraied the charge of a new ſupply) entred into a deepe conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and propounded amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, whether it were fit to enter into a new contribution, or in time to ſend for
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:23153:29"/>
home the Lord <hi>La-ware,</hi> and to abandon the action. They reſolued to ſend for ſir <hi>Thomas Gates,</hi> who being come, they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iured him to deale plainely with them, and to make a true relation of thoſe things which were preſently to be had, or hereafter to be hoped for in Virginia<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sir <hi>Thomas Gates</hi> with a ſolemne and ſacred oath replied, that all things before repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted were true: that the country yeeldeth abundance of wood, as Oake, Wainſcot, Walnut tres, Bay trees, Aſhe, Sarſafraſe, liue Oake, greene all the yeare, Cedar and Firre; which are the materials, of foape aſhes, and pot aſhes, of oyles of walnuts, and bayes, of pitch and tarre, of Clap boards, Pipe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>ſtaues, Maſts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent boardes of forty, fifty and ſixtie length, and three foote bredth, when one Firre tree is able to make the maine Maſt of the greateſt ſhip in England. He a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouched, that there are incredible variety of ſweet woods, eſpecially of the Balſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum tree, which diſtilleth a pretious
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:23153:29"/>
gum; that there are innumerable white Mulberry trees, which in ſo warme a cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate may cheriſh and feede millions of ſilke wormes, and returne vs in a very ſhort time, as great a plenty of ſilke as is vented into the whole world from al the parts of Italy: that there are diuers ſorts of Minerals, eſpecially of Iron oare, lying vpon the ground for ten miles circuite; of which we haue made triall at home, that it maketh as good Iron as any is in Europe:) that a kinde of hempe or flax, and ſilke graſſe doe grow there naturally, which will affoord ſtuffe for all manner of excellent Cordage: that the riuer ſwarmeth with Sturgeon; the land a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boundeth with Vines, the woodes doe harbor exceeding ſtore of Beauers, Foxes and Squirrils, the waters doe nouriſh a great encreaſe of Otters; all which are couered with pretious furres: that there are in preſent diſcouered dyes and drugs of ſundry qualities; that the Orenges which haue beene planted, did proſper
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:23153:30"/>
in the winter, which is an infallible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, that Lymmons, ſugar Canes, Almonds, Rice, Anniſeede, and all other commodities which we haue from the Staights, may be ſupplied to vs in our owne countrey, and by our owne indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry: that the corne yeeldeth a trebble en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe more then ours; and laſtly, that it is one of the goodlieſt countries vnder the ſunne; enterueined with fiue maine Riuers, and promiſing as rich entrals as any Kingdome of the earth, to whom the ſunne is no neerer a neighbour.</p>
            <p>VVhat theſe things will yeelde, the Merchant beſt knoweth, who findeth by experience, that many hundreth of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of pounds are yearly ſpent in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome in theſe commodities. The Merchant knoweth, that Caueare and Traine which come from Ruſsia, can be brought hither but once in the yeare, in regard of the Ice: and that Sturgeon which is brought from the Eaſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, can come but twice a yeare; and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:23153:30"/>
that not before the end of Aprill, or the beginning of May; which many times in regard of the heat of thoſe moneths, is tainted in the tranſportation: when from Virginia they may be brought to vs in foure and twenty daies, and in al the colde ſeaſons of the yeare. The Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants know, that the commodity of ſope and pot aſhes are very ſcant in Pruſsia; that they are brought three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles by land, and three hundred miles by riuers, before they come to the Sea; that they pay a cuſtome there, and another in Denmarke, which enhanceth the prices exceedingly: But in Virginia they may haue them without carriage by land or cuſtom (becauſe fiue Nauigable Riuers doe lead vp fiue ſeuerall waies into the bowels of the whole countrey.) As therefore the like Riuers, are the cauſe of the riches of Holland, ſo will theſe be to vs a wondrous cauſe of ſauing of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences. The merchant knoweth, that through the troubles in Poland &amp; Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couy,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:23153:31"/>
(whoſe eternall warres are like the Antipathy of the Dragon &amp; Elephants) all their traffique for Maſtes, Deales, Pitch, Tarre, Flaxe, Hempe, and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, are euery day more and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered, and the woods of thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are almoſt exhauſted. All which are to be had in Virginia with farre leſſe charge, and farre more ſafety. Laſtly, the Merchant knoweth, that for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities in the Staights, as ſweet wines, orenges, lemmonds, anniſeeds, &amp;c. that we ſtand at the deuotion of politique Princes and States, who for their proper vtility, deuiſe all courſes to grinde our merchants, all pretences to confiſcate their goods, and to draw from vs al mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of gaine by their inquiſitiue inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: when in Virginia, a few yeares labour by planting and husbandry, will furniſh all our defects, with honour and ſecurity; eſpecially ſince the Frenchmen (who are with the Lord Gouernour) do confidently promiſe, that within two
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:23153:31"/>
yeares we may expect a plentifull Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>VVhen therfore this noble enterpriſe, by the rules of Religion is expreſly iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; when the paſſages by Sea are all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen and diſcouered; when the climate is ſo fruitfully tempered; when the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall riches of the ſoile are ſo powerfully confirmed: will any man ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray his owne inconſiderate ignorance, and bewray his raſhneſſe; that when the ſame Sunne ſhineth, he ſhould not haue the ſame eies to beholde it; when the ſame hope remaines, he ſhould not haue the ſame heart to apprehend it? At the voyage of Sir <hi>Thomas Gates,</hi> what ſwarmes of people deſired to be tranſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted? what alacrity and cheerefulneſſe in the Aduenturers by free wil offerings, to build vp this new Tabernacle? Shall we now be deiected? Shall we caſt downe our heads like Bull ruſhes? becauſe one ſtorme at ſea hath deferred our ioyes and comforts! VVe are too effeminate in our
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:23153:32"/>
longings, and too impatient of delaies. Gods al-diſpoſing prouidence, is not compellable by mans violence. Let any wiſedome giue a ſolide reaſon, why his purpoſe ſhould be changed, when thoſe grounds which gaue life to his firſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, are not changed. It is but a golden ſlumber, that dreameth of any humane felicity, which is not ſauced with ſome contingent miſerie. <hi>Dolor &amp; voluptas, inui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem cedunt,</hi> Griefe and pleaſure are the croſſe ſailes of the worlds euer-turning-windmill. Let no man therefore be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer wiſe, to caſt beyond the moone and to multiply needleſſe doubts and queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. <hi>Hannibal</hi> by too much wiſedome, loſt opportunity to haue ſacked Rome <hi>Charles</hi> the eighth of Fraunce, by tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing, loſt the Kingdome of Naples, and the gouernement of Florence: <hi>Henry</hi> the ſeuenth by too much ouer-warines, loſt the riches of the golden Indies. Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is pretious, but when it is occaſion. Some of our neighbours would ioine in
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:23153:32"/>
the action, if they might be ioynt inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in the Plantation; which is an eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent prooſe, that Virginia ſhall no ſooner be quitted by vs, then it will be reinhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them. A diſhonor of that nature, that will eternally blemiſh our Nation; as though we were like the furious <hi>Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus,</hi> or impetuous Swiſſers, who in a brunt can conquer any thing, but with wiſedome can maintaine nothing. It is time to wipe away ſuch an imputation of Barbariſme, eſpecially ſince the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is ſo pregnant, that without this or the like, the ſtate cannot ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome dangerous and imminent mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. He is ouer blinde that doth not ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> what an inundation of people doth ouerſlow this little Iland: Shall we vent this deluge, by indirect and vnchriſtian policies? ſhal we imitate the bloody and heatheniſh counſell of the Romanes, to leane a Catthage ſtanding, that may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſt our people by forraine warre? or ſhall we nouriſh domeſticall faction,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:23153:33"/>
that as in the dayes of <hi>Vitellius</hi> and <hi>Veſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian,</hi> the ſonne may imbrew his hands in the blood of the father? Or ſhall we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the barbarous foot-ſteps of the ſtate of China, to impriſon our people in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle circle of the earth, and conſume them by peſtilence? Or ſhall we like the beaſt of Babylon, denie to any ſort the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable eſtate of mariage, and allow abho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable ſtewes, that our people may not ouer increaſe in multitude? Or ſhall we take an inhumane example from the Muſcouite, in a time of famine to put tenne thouſand of the poore vnder the yce as the Mice and Rats of a ſtate poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique? If all theſe be diabolicall and hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh proiects, what other means remaines to vs, but by ſetling ſo excellent a Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to diſimbarke ſome millions of people vpon a land that floweth with all manner of plenty?</p>
            <p>To wade a little further, who euer ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted the monuments of antiquity, and doth not finde, that Carthage aſpired to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:23153:33"/>
be Empreſſe of the world, by her oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of hauens and multitude of ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping? What hindereth the great Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metane Prince, from ſeazing vpon al the territories of Europe, but onely the want of skilfull marriners? What created the rich and free ſtates of Holland, but their winged Nauy? It was a fit embleme that painted death ſtanding vpon the ſhoares of Fraunce, Germany and Spaine, and looking ouer into England: intymating vnto vs, that ſo long as we are Lords of the narrow ſeas, death ſtands on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhoares, and onely can looke vpon vs: but if our wooden wals were ruina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, death would ſoone make a bridge to come ouer, and deuoure our Nation. When therefore our mils of Iron, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe of building, haue already turned our greateſt woods into paſture and cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion, within theſe few years; neither the ſcattered Forreſts of England, nor the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed Groues of Ireland, will ſupply the defect of our Nauy. When in Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:23153:34"/>
there is nothing wanting, but onely mens labours, to furniſh both Prince, State and merchant, without charge or difficulty. Againe, whither ſhall wee tranſport our cloth, and how ſhall we ſuſtaine our Artiſans? Shall we ſend it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Turkey? Some priuate and deceitfull auarice hath diſcredited our merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize. Into Spaine? it aboundeth with ſheepe and wooll. Into Poland and Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couy? the daunger doth ouer-ballance the gaine in times of contention. Into Fraunce and Germany? they are for the moſt part ſupplied by their owne peace. VVhen if our Colony were peopled in Virginia, <hi>mutabit vellera merces,</hi> we ſhall exchange our ſtore of cloth for other merchandize. Let any man reſolue why the Councell of Virginia, doe now moſt earneſtly continue their aduentures? why thoſe that were (eye witneſſes) of the former ſuppoſed miſeries, do voluntarily returne with ioy and comfort? why thoſe noble and worthy perſonages, doe
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:23153:34"/>
offer to make the action good vpon the hazard of their liues &amp; fortunes? And why Sir <hi>Thomas Gates</hi> longeth and haſteneth to go thither again, and the Lord <hi>La-ware</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireth ſo earneſtly to ſtay there? Are not all theſe things as deere to them as to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the Aduenturers? Haue not their hopes the ſame wings? their feares the ſame fetters? their eſtates the ſame rockes? their liues and ſoules greater gulfes of perill and deſpair? And yet neither the imbracements of their wiues, nor indulgence to their babes, nor the neglect of their domeſticke fortunes, nor baniſhment from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine ſoile, nor any experimented dangers haue broken their noble reſolution.</p>

               <hi>Caeſar,</hi> wil not be wanting to adde a fourth, if wee would diſſolue that froſty Ioineſſe which chilleth our zeale, and maketh vs ſo cold in the action. But it is a meere <hi>Idaea,</hi> ſpeculation and fancy, to ſow ſparingly, and yet expect for to reape plentifully; when a penurious ſupply is like the caſting on of a little water vpon a great fire, that quencheth not the heat, but augments it: when procraſtinating delayes, and lingring counſels, doe loſe the oportunity of flying time; whereby we rather bewray our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony then releeue them: let no man adore his golde as his God, nor his Mammon as his Maker. If God haue ſcattered his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings vpon you as ſnow, will you returne no tributary acknowledgement of his goodneſſe? If you will, can you ſelect a more excellent ſubiect, then to caſt downe the altars of Diuels, that you may raiſe vp the Altar of Chriſt: to forbid the ſacrifice of men, that they may offer vp the ſacrifice of contrite ſpirites; to reduce Barbariſme and infidelity, to ciuill gouernement and Chriſtianity? <hi>Sifrigido loquor, nihil loquor;</hi>
