         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Theſe are the very cauſes vvhy I haue ſtaied, and as yet haue proceeded no further in the anſvveringeof M. Dormans booke. But vvhen I had paſſed thus farre, and the biſhoppes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvvere<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the reporte than vvent, vvas not fully finiſhed, and many good mèn muche deſired ſomme anſvvere, and as many aduerſaries as much bragged, that their bookes vvoulde neuer be anſvvered: the councell of ſome friendes, and ſuche continuall bragge of ſo many aduerſaries cauſed me to ſuffer this little taſte, as vntimely fruite, the ſooner to come abroade: that ſuche as finde double faulte vvith vs, for not anſvveryng ſpeedely, or fully, might in parte be ſatiſfied. And the rather haue I conſented to ſuche aduiſe of my friendes, for that by this taſte that I haue giuen the readers of M. Dorman, they ſhall knovv him throughly not a lyon (as they ſay) by his longe nayles, but a lyar by his leude tales. For by the vevve hereof, they may not onely iudge of his vvhole treatie: but alſo, this principall parte, and firſte fronte, (in the vvhiche M.

At the leaſt, I truſt, I haue ſo farre ſatiſfied the diſcrete reader concerninge M. Dorman, that it ſhall ſuffice hereafter to paſſe ouer the reſidue of his booke by briefe notes. And I doo truſte alſo, that ſuche as ſhall blame me moſte for not anſvvering the vvhole, ſhalbe greued moſte that I haue anſvvered ſo much: and that thoſe, that ſhall finde moſte faulte i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

For as their bookes vvere not therfore ſodenly vvriten, for that they came ſodenly abroade, ſo ſhal <note place="margin">M. <hi>Raſtell in his prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fa econfeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth his booke to haue bene begun four yeeres agoe.</hi>
               </note> they, I doubt not, be anſvvered ſpedely: that is, in ſhorter ſpace then they vvere vvriten in. And yet all ſpeede is not alvvay in moſt haſte. For it may ſo fall out that M. Dorman vvith the vvhole company of his adhaerentes the Papiſtes ſhall more eaſily write tenne ſuch boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes more at randon, as this is written, then be hable to mainteine and to defende directlie this little parcel of his booke, as eyther tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie or learnedly written. And thus muche I thought good to ſaie concerning our not ſpeedie anſweringe (as ſome men thinke) and my parcel anſwering (which ſome men wil blame) for the ſatisfiyng
<pb facs="tcp:13729:6"/>
of ſome, for all looke not to ſatisfie, though al Dormans, and al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Papiſts, were altogether already ſo anſwered as they al might be aſhamed of their dooinges, as I doubt nothinge, god willinge, but it ſhall ſhortely ſo come to paſſe, though peraduenture not one emongſt them all will euer confeſſe the ſame.</p>
            <p>Now that I haue ſo diligently and largely, and as it may ſeeme care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully alſo, anſwered M. Dorman (whoſe owne dooynges, I affirme to be more woorthy of laughter, than of any earneſt anſwere) which ſhall. I am ſure, be layde alſo to my charge, I doo certifie the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that I doo not anſwere the reaſons alleaged in this booke, as M. Dormans, but as the reaſons of D. Hardinge, of whom M Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man hath borowed them: and not onely Doctor Hardinges, but Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>krus, Pighius, and Hoſius reaſons alſo, yea and of all thoſe, that haue written in Latine for the Popes vſurped power, and ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, in whoſe writinges the like reaſons are to be found, and out of whom D. Hardinge (as out of him M. Dorman) hath tranſlated <hi>adverbum</hi> almoſt, ſuch places as he thought for his purpoſe: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I haue vſed the more dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as vnder the name of one, anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe ſo many. An other and moſt weightie cauſe why I haue vſed ſuch diligence and prolixitie, is this: M. Dorman though he be a weake aſſaylant and ſclender reaſoner, yet is he a great lyar, and a venemous ſclaunderer: and therefore hath he ſette abroade a lewde booke in deede, but not ſo lewde as ſclaunderous: and ſclaunderous not to ſeueral perſons onely, but to our whole countrey, to our la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wes, and to our gratious ſoueraigne, whom he chargeth as vſurping vndue authoritie: ſclaunderous I ſay, not here at home onely, but abroade alſo in foraigne countreis. VVherefore whom ſo euer M. Dorman ſheweth him ſelfe to be, and how ſclender an aunſwere ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer might beſt become him: I thought it ſhould become me, not ſclenderly to eſteeme the honour of my prince, my d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>etie to my countrey, and to the lawes of the realme: but with earneſtneſſe to repell ſuche reproches, as M. Dorman hath attempted to blemiſhe them withall. Thirdelie for that the ſimple and vnlearned readers haue often beſt liking in bookes more boldely then learnedly writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and are moſt in daunger to creadite moſt lewde and ſclaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſe lyes (in ſo muche that a great many for the commendation of theſe vertues, doo praeferre the Scholar before the Maiſter, M. Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man I meane, before D.

of meane vnderſtandinge, to whom the guilefull dealinges of the Papiſtes can not with breuitie be made manifeſt. For as a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent at a touch thruſteth in his ſtinge and venime: but the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheafe in like wiſe can not be as ſodeinlie cured, but requireth lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time, and buſineſſe: ſo can not the ſclaunderous and venemous lyes by M. Dorman quickely tould, be ſo quickely and brieflie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, with ſuch plaineneſſe, as is mete for ſuch who are moſt in daunger to credite ſuch falſe tales. VVherfore (good reader) if I ſhal ſeeme to be too prolix and tedious, yea and to careful too in anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe ſo largely and diligently ſuch a one as M.

And therefore euen the chief of the <note place="margin">Hoſius contra Brentium lib<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1. folio. 24. &amp; lib. 5. fol. 249.</note> Papiſtes can not but therefore muche commende vs. What abuſe therefore is this of the readers, and of his own, and other mennes tyme, that M.

this is altogether impertinent to his purpoſe, to make any ſhewe for the Popes authoritie, or any reſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>blaunce of our doinges againſt the Pope. For if he would haue it to perteine to vs, as doing the like now as was dooen in ſainct Baſilles tyme by the Arrians (For he ſaieth, it dooeth liuelie repreſente our tymes) why maie not we with as good, and more reaſon, affirme it rather to apperteine to the Papiſtes them ſelues, and moſte liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie to repreſent their doynges?

For the obteinyng of the whiche higheſt place among them, ſo many fraudes, ſimonies, poiſonynges, bloudie fightes, and murders haue been committed: as maie to ſuche, who will read their owne ſtories, well appeare. Yea the verſe Pope that now is, <note place="margin">In oratione habita in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtorio Romae 1564.

               <p>You ſee here the concluſion gathered out of that, whiche hetherto by hym hath been alledged out of S. Cyprian, and ſainct Baſill. And how the verie wordes written by ſainct Cyprian, in the places before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, for the maintenaunce of biſhoppe Rogatian his authoritie, and for his owne authoritie alſo, thei being bothe Biſhoppes of Afrike, he is not aſhamed here in his concluſion, to place out of place, and to apply them
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13729:14"/>
to the proofe of the biſhoppe of Rome his ſupremacie, whervnto thei apperteine nothyng at all: and to frame thereof this leude argument: The entrie into all here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies is, to make open warres againſt the biſhop appo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inted by God, to bee the lawfull gouernour and heade of the churche. This is the <hi>maior,</hi> and is proued by S.

                  </gap> the <hi>minor,</hi> is falſe, and a falſe concluſion doeth folowe of the ſame. For the biſhop (of whom S. Cyprian ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth) appointed by God to be lawfull gouernour, and heade of the churche, is in Carthage S. Cyprian hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: and Rogatian, in his owne Dioceſſe: and not the Biſhop of Rome, otherwiſe then in his owne Dioceſſe onely. And therefore open warre to bee made againſte them, in their owne Dioceſſe, whereof thei be lawfull biſhoppes, is the beginnyng of hereſies, and not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſte the biſhop of Rome, vſurpyng to be head of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſall Churche, ouer the whiche, of right, he hath no authoritie. For theſe woordes. <hi>[the biſhop appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, to bee the lawfull gouernour and head of the churche]</hi> if thei make for any ſupremacie at all, thei make for the ſupremacie of Rogatian, and Cyprian biſhops of Afrike, of who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> S. Cyprian ſpeaketh theim: and not of the biſhop of Rome, of whom in thoſe Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles he ſpeaketh not one woorde. And if thei make not for the ſupremacie of Cyprian, &amp; Rogatian, thei make for none at all: and if thei make for no ſupremacie at al, they were here without all cauſe alledged by M. Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, but onely to deceiue the ſimple, by ſuche a guile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and vntrue introduction to his firſte falſe propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:13729:15"/>
of the Pope his ſupremacie. Now if he thinke yet that he might make ſuche a ſimple collection of S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian and S. Baſill his woordes, as this: That as the beginnyng of hereſies in their time, was the contempt of the inferiours towardes their owne Biſhops (for ſo S. Cyprian teacheth) ſo in likewiſe is the contempte of the Pope, as the higheſt of all biſhops, the beginnyng of hereſies now. Firſt I denie the argument, for that it foloweth not, though it be euill for the inferiour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeie his owne biſhop, to whoſe obedience in all god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe he is bounden. Therfore it is euill for a ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, not to obeie a ſtraunge foraine vſurpar, to whom he oweth no duetie of obedie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Againe I ſaie, though it be the beginnyng of hereſie, to diſobey Cyprian, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatian, yea or Cornelius, beyng godlie and catholike biſhops: yet is it not likewiſe the beginnyng of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, to diſobey any the late Popes of Rome: who were not onely no godlie biſhops (as were Cyprian, Roga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and Cornelius) but bothe moſte wicked, and in deede no Biſhops at all, but falſe vſurpers of worldlie tyrannie.

As it is euident, that we are moſte farre from No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natus hereſie, ſo is Nouatus his othe not onely vnlike, but cleane contrary to our othes. The controuerſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Cornelius and Nouatus was not, whether the biſhop of Rome was the ſupreme head of the churche, (as it is now betwene vs and the Papiſtes) but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Cornelius or he was by right y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Biſhop of Rome. And Nouatus exacted of the Romaines, or Italians, an othe, that thei ſhould cleaue to hym as their biſhop, againſte Cornelius, who was their true Biſhoppe in <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Euſebius libr.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 43.</note> déede: whiche was vnlawfull to require. Our othes be of obedience to our naturall Prince, due by Goddes lawe: and of renouncyng of foraine vſurped power, or authoritie ouer our Prince and countrey: without the whiche, we ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> not be faithful to our owne ſoueraigne. But let vs conſider his woordes. <hi>Thus did Nouatus,</hi> ſaieth M.

And further the ſaied

othe concerned the maintenaunce of Nouatus his he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie: whiche was, that ſuche, as for feare of tormentes had renounced the Chriſtian faithe, or had offered In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to the Idoles of the Gentiles, though thei repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted therefore, were not to bée receiued into the churche againe: whiche cruell opinion, as well S.

Dorma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not onely to applie to vs the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Nouatus othe, exacted for the maintenaunce of his hereſies: but alſo to call Nouatus our aunceſtor, and our Biſhops as his diſciples, indurate heretikes: who doo moſte abhorre bothe Nouatus, and his hereſie, and moſte earneſtly, and pithilie in all their writyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and Sermons doo impugne the ſame, by ſettyng foorth to their power, the vnſpeakeable mercie of God towardes all ſinners truely penitent. Wherby it maie appeare to the diſcreate readers, that M. Dorman, and ſuche other malitious aduerſaries, paſſe not muche whether they lie, or ſaie truthe, ſo they maie bryng vs, by hooke or crooke out of credite, and into the hatred of the worlde. I beleue alſo that M. Dorman in the allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Nouatus his othe, had a further reſpecte to that he maketh mention of the bodie &amp; bloud of Chriſt: by the whiche, becauſe Nouatus cauſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to ſweare, M. Dorma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thought belike, thereby to proue, or at leaſt to make an inſinuation, to the ſimple, that the bodie and bloud of Chriſte, ſhould bee corporallie preſente in the Sacramente: but the daiely othes of blaſphemous men, ſwearyng likewiſe in his corporall abſence, doo confute that collection.

<pb facs="tcp:13729:18"/>
matter of the lordes ſupper (whiche he here calleth the ſacrament of th'altar) he was farre deceiued. For both Nicephorus and Euſebius callyng it after the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration (as thei terme it) bread, and Nicephorus ſaiyng that thei taſted that whiche thei receiued, that is to ſay, bread: and by the circumſtances it appearyng, that the vſe of the primitiue churche than, was agreable to our vſe now, in geuyng the Sacrament into the receiuers handes, bothe is their tranſubſtantiation cleane euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, by twoo witneſſes, euen by M.

But to cloke theſe matters, where Nicephorus calleth it the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution of the breade, M.

But in deede this is M. Dorman his ordinarie cuſtome in alledgyng of authours, to paſſe ouer with ſilence that whiche is againſte hym, and to take that whiche ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a ſhewe for hym, and withall to adde that is not in the authour, in ſuche ſorte, as the ignorante would thinke it to be the authours verie woordes. I knowe, it is impertinente to entreate of the matter of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:13729:18"/>
in this controuerſie of the Popes ſupremacie: but M. Dorman, of purpoſe as it ſemeth, doeth mingle ſuche thynges by the waie: whiche, if thei be there an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, ſhal make a mingle mangle of diuers matters vnpleaſaunte to the reader: and if thei bee paſſed ouer not anſwered, as impertinent to the preſent treatie, he truſted it would ſerue to inta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gle the ſimple, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to bee an occaſion to his fauourers, to triumphe in the meane tyme, as though wee diſſembled the matter by ſilence, for that wee could ſaie nothyng to it. But to retourne to the purpoſe againe: whereas M. Dorman hath here in one halfe leafe, heaped a greate number of euidente lies, as it were, in a packet together, I haue thought good to putte the reader in remembraunce of them, in order as thei lie. The firſt lie is, that after his diſcourſe out of S. Cyprian, of the Biſhop appoincted by God, to be the gouernour and head of the Churche, he ſaieth, <hi>the biſhop of Rome is that heade,</hi> whereas by S. Cyprian, the contrarie is euident: and that hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <note place="margin">1.</note> or biſhop Rogatian is that head, whereof he ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, as hath been fully heretofore declared. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde is, <hi>that to make warre againſte the Biſhoppe of Rome, is the firſte entrie to hereſie.</hi> Whereas S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian <note place="margin">2.</note> teacheth, that the contempte of euery godlie bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop in his owne dioceſſe, by ſuche as are their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, is the beginnyng of hereſies. The third is, that he ſaieth: <hi>Thus did Nouatus:</hi> to witte, that Nouatus <note place="margin">3.</note> made hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>yrſt entrie into his hereſies, by makyng open warr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> againſt the biſhop of Rome, appoincted by God to be in earth the gouernour and head of the Churche: whiche is a double lie, and maieſtande for twoo. For Nouatus began his hereſies firſte in Afrike, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with S. Cyprian, before he troubled Cornelius <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Cyprianus lib.</hi> 2. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 8.</note> at Rome, as by the teſtimonie of S. Cyprian is euide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t.
<pb facs="tcp:13729:19"/>
Wherefore his entrie to his hereſies, was his proclai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myng of open warre againſte S. Cyprian, appoincted by God, to be the gouernour and head of the Churche, as S. Cyprian hymſelf ſaieth. The other parte of this lie is, that he ſaieth, <hi>Nouatus made warre againſt him, as the gouernour and head of the churche:</hi> for his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, <hi>Thus did Nouatus,</hi> muſt nedes be referred to that whiche wente before: but Nouatus tooke not Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, but hymſelf to be biſhoppe of Rome, as doeth by the ſtorie euidentlie appeare: wherefore the ſtrief be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene theim was not, whether Cornelius as biſhop of Rome was head of the churche (as M. Dorman would haue it ſeme) but whether he, or Nouatus were biſhop of Rome. The fourth lie is a double lie alſo: where he reporteth that Nicephorus ſaieth, <hi>that Nouatus hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4.</note>

And this dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blelie, the receiuyng of the bleſſed Sacramente of the altar, in ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ifte lie is, that he ſaieth, <hi>wee doo ſweare men in ſuche ſorte as Nouatus did: and that no manne</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">5.</note> 
                  <hi>can either gette any liuyng, or kept that he hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out makyng of this othe:</hi> Meanyng ſuche as Nouatus exacted. But Nouatus exacted an othe of the Romai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to cleaus to hym againſte their owne Biſhoppe,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:13729:19"/>
whiche was vnlawfull. Wée require an othe of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iectes Engliſhemen, of obedience to their and our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Prince, and of renouncyng all forraine and v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped power. Again Nouatus cauſed them to ſweare that his hereſie was the truth, and that Cornelius true doctrine was hereſie. Wee haue no ſuche matters in hande, but are on Cornelius ſide againſte Nouatus, teachyng the ſame doctrine that Cornelius did, abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryng the hereſie that Nouatus taught. Wherefore in this manifolde fable of M. Dormans, amplified by his Rhetorike, looke how often he ſaieth, <hi>ſo did Luther, ſo did Caluine, ſo doo thoſe wicked men in our countrey:</hi> as ofte, as he ſaieth: <hi>Thei exacted this othe. &amp;c. If he geue not this othe. &amp;c.</hi> So many tymes as M. Dorma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> doeth repeate theſe woordes, <hi>this</hi> and <hi>ſo,</hi> ſo many loude, lewde lies hath he made, one vpon an others backe: whereas in deede it is neither ſo, nor ſo.</p>
               <p>This M. Dormans deceiptfull dealyng, moſte vſual vnto hym, was the cauſe why I ſaide once in publike place, that I had not found any one authoritie by him, (as farre as then I had redde) truely alledged, beſides his vntrue notyng of the places in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> marge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Which, though it ſometyme happen by negligence of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, M.

Thus farre ſainct Cyprian. Whereby you maie ſee, that he calleth not Cornelius here the biſhoppe of the Catholike churche, but Biſhoppe Cornelius ordeined in the Catholike churche by God his iudgemente, and the election of the Cleargie and people. And this is all one in ſenſe and meanyng with the other. For <hi>Epiſcopus Catholicę ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiae,</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopus in catholica eccleſia,</hi> be as muche to ſaie, as <hi>Catholicus Epiſcopus,</hi> a catholike biſhoppe, and not <hi>the Biſhoppe of the Catholike or vniuerſall Churche,</hi> as M.

For this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng in controuerſie, whether Cornelius or Nouatus was the true and Catholike Biſhoppe, or Prieſte, and whiche was the vſurper and heretike: here doo <hi>Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and <hi>Vrbanus</hi> with others confeſſe, that Corneli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us was the Catholike biſhoppe. Wherefore M.

                  <hi>God, one Chriſte our Lorde, one holie Ghoſt, and that there muſt be one biſhoppe in the Catholike churche.</hi> or more truely, in this place, in a Catholike Churche. This M. Dorman did not doubte, but that the ſimple ſorte would take it to bee a moſte plaine proofe, not of Cornelius ſupremacie onely, but <hi>ex abunda<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te,</hi> that he
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13729:30"/>
alone was that one Biſhoppe, whiche ought to be one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the whole Catholike Churche: for ſo it ſemeth by his marginall note, <hi>of one God, one Biſhoppe &amp;c.</hi> he meaneth. But I truſt, that fewe will allowe M. Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, euen of thoſe that be of his own part, if he would ſo wreſt ſainct Cypria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that as there is one onely God, and none but he: ſo there ſhould bée but one onely Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppe, and no mo but he. Whereas nothing leſſe was meant by them, that made this confeſſion, nor by ſainct Cyprian, who maketh reporte thereof. For firſte, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ximus</hi> and his felowes, whiche had before ioigned the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues to Nouatus, who chalenged to bée a true catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like biſhoppe, and biſhoppe of Rome alſo, doo now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Cornelius to be the true biſhoppe: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there can be no moe biſhoppes in any one catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like churche but one, therefore now affirmyng Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius to be that one Biſhoppe, thei doo reiecte Nouatus as no biſhoppe, but an vſurper: and thereby acknowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that there ought to bee but one biſhoppe in that catholike churche. And ſo nothyng leſſe is meant here, by one biſhoppe, then one head biſhoppe ouer all other biſhoppes: muche leſſe is meant one biſhoppe alone of all the Churche, as there is one onely God ouer all: as it maie ſeme that M. Dorman would gather. For the declaration whereof, it is to be noted, that when ſainct Cypria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſpeaketh of one biſhop of the catholike churche, he meaneth no one ſpeciall Biſhoppe ouer all, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differentlie all, and euery catholike biſhop throughout the vniuerſall churche: for that thei haue euery of them the full poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of one onely biſhoprike. Whiche as it is but one throughout all the worlde, ſo hath euery bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop the ſame, wholie, and fullie. So that when ſainct Cyprian ſpeaketh of one Biſhoppe onely to rule the Churche, he meaneth the Biſhoppe of that Dioceſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:13729:31"/>
whiche he then entreateth of, who ſo euer, and of what countrey ſo euer he be: as here in this epiſtle, he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Cornelius: and in his epiſtle to Pupianus, by the <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>epiſt.</hi> 5.</note> ſaid one biſhop, appoincted by God to rule the churche, he meaneth hymſelf beyng biſhop of Carthage. For in bothe places he hath the ſame woordes, of one biſhoppe <note place="margin">

This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth yet more fully to be declared, as well by Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius, as by ſaincte Cyprian hymſelfe in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Firſt Cornelius writyng to Fabius Biſhoppe of Antioche (as Euſebius teſtifieth) hath theſe woordes <note place="margin">

By whiche woordes it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Catholike churche, whereof Cornelius and Cyprian doo ſpeake, and wherein there muſte bee but one biſhop, is not the vniuerſall churche through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the worlde, as M.

churche is by Cornelius here, &amp; by S.

Now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cernyng S.

The whiche vnitie we muſt firmely hold and mainteine: ſpeciallie wee Biſhoppes, whiche doo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne in the Churche, that we maie proue the biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike it ſelf alſo to bee one, and vndeuided. Let no man by liyng deceiue the brotherhodde: let no man corrupte the veritie of faith by falſe preuarication. There is one Biſhoprike, parte whereof euery man hath wholie, or <note place="margin">In ſolidum.</note> more plainely, there is one Biſhoprike, whiche euery biſhop hath wholie for his part. There is one churche, whiche is ſpread abroade by increaſe of fruictefulneſſe into a multitude: as there be many beames of the ſu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, but one light: many braunches of the tree, but one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of it, ſtaied vpon a ſure roote. &amp;c. Thus farre ſaincte Cyprian, with muche more proceſſe to proue the vnitie of the churche, and the vnitie of one biſhoprike, whiche euery Biſhop wholie hath for his parte: and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentlie, all Biſhops to be equall. Wherefore maiſter Dorman hath in vain noted in the marge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of his booke in this place, <hi>One God, one Chriſte, one holie Ghoſt, one Biſhoppe:</hi> as though the Biſhoppe of Rome were that one Biſhop, and none but he: as there is one one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, and none but he. Where as that place of ſainct Cyprian (as by conference with this place appeareth) proueth, that though there be one biſhoprike through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the worlde, yet are there many biſhops, and that euery one, in his owne Dioceſſe, hath the whole poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of that one Biſhoprike: and that therefore there is an equalitie of all Biſhops, and ſo conſequently, no ſuperioritie of any one ouer all, as M. Dorman would haue it. For if euery Biſhop haue <hi>in ſolidum,</hi> that is to ſaie, fullie, and wholie that one Biſhoprike, or biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:13729:32"/>
function and office, as S. Cyprian ſaieth, no one ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue more, then the whole, and therefore, no one can be aboue all other. Whiche maie appeare more plainlie, by the compariſons of one faithe, and one Baptiſme, whiche ſaincte Cyprian in the ſame place vſeth. For as there is but one faithe, though there be many faithfull perſones: one Baptiſme, though many Baptiſed: ſo there is by ſainct Cyprian his iudgement but one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprike, yet be there many Biſhops: whiche one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprike is equallie, and wholie diuided emongeſte all the ſaid Biſhops: as faithe and Baptiſme are equally, and wholie diuided emongeſte the faithfull Baptiſed: and yet remaineth ſtill but one Biſhoprike, as there doeth but one faithe, and one Baptiſme: for that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry biſhoppe hath that one biſhoprike wholie: as euery true faithfull hath the one chriſtian faithe wholie: and <note place="margin">In ſolidum.</note> euery one, that is duely Baptiſed, hath that one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme wholie. And conſequently it foloweth, that as no one man hath any ſuperioritie in Baptiſme, or faithe, aboue other truely faithfull, and Baptiſed: ſo hath no one biſhoppe any ſuperioritie ouer other biſhoppes, for that euery biſhop hath that one biſhoprike wholie, and therfore none hath it more then other, but be all equall <note place="margin">In ſolidum.</note> in office and authoritie. This is S. Cyprian his minde of one Biſhopricke, whiche euery biſhop hath wholie, and equallie, and is therfore in his owne Dioceſſe the one onely biſhop in the catholike Churche to gouerne the ſame. Whereby any manne, but of meane vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandyng, maie well perceiue, that this ſaiyng of one biſhoppe, vſed by ſainct Cyprian, maketh nothyng for the biſhoppe of Rome his ſupremacie, but directlie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte it: makyng all other biſhops equall with hym: as thei, whiche haue <hi>in ſolidum,</hi> wholie, that one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprike, as well as he. And therefore when ſainct Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian
<pb facs="tcp:13729:33"/>
nameth one biſhop in the catholike church, or of a catholike churche, he meaneth the biſhop of that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall dioceſſe which he entreateth of, of what countrey ſo euer it be, as here he meaneth Cornelius: and by the like wordes in other places, he meaneth other biſhops, and of other dioceſſes. Whiche is moſte euident by the like wordes, of one Biſhop who gouerneth the church, vſed by the ſame ſaincte Cyprian, in this epiſtle to <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pianus.</hi> His woordes be theſe: <hi>Epiſcopus, qui vnus e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

And therefore are we worthie to dye moſte cruell death, due to ſuche falſe heretiques. Graunte this one propoſition of the Popes ſupremacie with the appurtenaunces, I ſaie, and by and by, all that M.

But if you like your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion ſo well, that you will nedes co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, <hi>that there ought to bee one generall heade of all Churches,</hi> you muſt thus begin.

euery Biſhop in his owne dioceſſe, is that one Biſhop that ruleth in the churche: and that iudge for the time, in the ſteede of Chriſte. And that in this place, ſaincte Cyprian meaneth no ſupremacie of any one Biſhop, but the equalitie of all Biſhops, it maie bee moſte eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to them, that will read the whole epiſtle, and note how ofte he ſpeaketh of all Prieſtes, and Biſhops. As, <hi>Sacerdotibus tantus honor conceditur:</hi> ſo great honor is geuen to Prieſtes: and immediatlie before the place by M.

Wherefore the Apologie is herein vniuſtlie blamed of you M. Dorman: neither dooeth S.

               <p>It is true that S. Hierome is of the ſame minde that S. Cyprian was of: but neither of them bothe were of that minde that D. Hardyng and M.

Neither hath ſainct Hierome in the whole dialogue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Luciferians, aſmuche as one woorde that is ſpeciall to the Biſhop of Rome onelie, but common to all biſhops of all places: as the learned, that will reade the dialogue, ſhall eaſilie vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de: and as Eraſmus in the argumente of the ſaied Dialogue, hath well no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſaiyng: <hi>Liber eſt in primis lectu dignus, quippe qui multa ſalutaria praecepta complectatur de vita Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porum.</hi> The booke is verie woorthie to be reade (ſaieth Eraſmus) as the whiche doeth conteine many holſome preceptes concernyng the life of Biſhops.

<pb facs="tcp:13729:51"/>
the whiche holie ghoſt we all doo affirme to bee geuen in true Baptiſme? Learne, this obſeruation to come of that authoritie, that after the aſcenſion of our Lorde, the holie ghoſt came doune vnto the Apoſtles. And we finde that the ſame is dooen in many places, rather for the honour of Prieſthoode, then of the neceſſitie of the lawe. Els if the holie Ghoſte come doune onelie at the praier of the biſhop, thei are to be lamented, who being baptiſed by Prieſtes and deacons, in little tounes and villages, or places further of, doo dye before thei be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited by the biſhops. <hi>The healthe of the church depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vpon the eſtimation of the chief Prieſt: who, if he haue not authoritie peareleſſe, and aboue all other, ye</hi>

                  <hi>ſhall haue in the churche ſo many ſchiſmes, as there be Prieſtes.</hi> Thus farre S. Hierome: whoſe woordes I haue repeated at large, and in the laſt place without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny intermiſſion haue ioigned the verie woordes, by D. Hardyng and M. Dorman alledged, to S. Hieromes woordes nexte before. Whereby it is moſte euidente that S. Hierome ſpeaketh of euery biſhop in his owne dioceſſe, and of the prieſtes and deacons that bée vnder hym in his ſaid dioceſſe. And that the authoritie which S. Hierome ſaieth the Biſhop hath, is the authoritie of laiyng his handes vpon children, or other lately bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by inferiour miniſters, and curates in villages of the ſaid dioceſſe (whiche authoritie is apperteinyng to all biſhops in their owne dioceſſe) &amp; that biſhops haue that authoritie geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> them aboue other prieſtes or dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, beyng curates of ſmaller tounes and villages in their dioceſſe, not by the neceſſitie of Gods lawe, but for the honour of their biſhoprike. For if euery prieſt of the dioceſſe ſhould in all poinctes bée of equall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie with the biſhop, there would ariſe ſo many Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes by the arrogancie of the prieſtes, as there bée prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtes.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:13729:51"/>
And for this cauſe hath euery biſhop an authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie peareleſſe (as M. Dorman dooth tranſlate it) and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all other prieſtes in his dioceſſe. For it is euident by the places before alledged, that compariſon is made betwene prieſtes, deacons and cuvates in ſmal tounes and villages, who haue authoritie to baptiſe, beeyng many, and betwene the Biſhop of the dioceſſe, who is one, and the high prieſte in the ſaied dioceſſe, and hath authoritie peareleſſe ouer all other prieſtes and deaco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in the ſame dioceſſe: And that there is no compariſon here made betwene the biſhoppe of Rome, as the high prieſte, or biſhop ouer all other prieſtes and biſhops, as D. Hardyng and M. Dorma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> without all ſhame would wreſt it: whereas there is not one woorde from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnyng of that longe dialogue of S. Hieromes vnto this place by them alleged, nor to the ende of the ſame, either written, or meante of the biſhop of Rome, but of euery Biſhop in his owne dioceſſe. And therefore this whole matter is altogether impertinente to D. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng, and M. Dormans purpoſe, of one onely heade o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the whole Churche, vnleſſe M. Dorman would frame vs therof this leude argument: Sainct Hierome ſaith that euery biſhop ought to haue authoritie aboue all other prieſtes of his owne dioceſſe, <hi>ergo</hi> the Biſhop of Rome ought to haue a preemine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce peareleſſe aboue all biſhops of all dioceſſes, and ouer the whole churche throughout the whole worlde. Whiche maie well bee M. Dorma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s reaſon: but fure I am, that no reaſonable man, beyng awake, will ſo reaſon.

And withall whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer was doen afterward, was not doen <hi>de iure diuino:</hi> vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the grounde of Gods lawe, as you would haue the Popes ſupremacie to ſtande, but of an eccleſiaſtical or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and pollicie. For that whiche was doen by Goddes lawe, was not dooen afterwarde, but firſt: this whiche was thus doen afterward, ſaieth ſainct Hierome, was doen rather for the honour of the prieſthood, then for the <note place="margin">Hierome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia Luciferia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos: ad hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem potius ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdotii, qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ad legis neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitatem.</note> neceſſitie of the law. For by the lawe of God, which is firſt, the prieſt (as S. Hierome ſaieth) maie doo aſmuche, exceptyng orderyng onelie, as maie the biſhop: but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde for order, one was placed in the higheſt place for the auoidyng of ſchiſmes. And if a prieſte by ſaincte Hieromes minde, maie doo aſmuche as a Biſhoppe, I thinke one biſhop alſo may by Gods lawe, doo aſmuche as an other biſhop. Further ſeyng <hi>this one afterwarde choſen to rule the reſte,</hi> was choſen aſwell at Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, as at Rome, or elſwhere: and the Biſhop of Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria was that rular of the reſte of his Cleargie, as well as was the biſhop of Rome of his owne cleargie: it muſt nedes fall out, that theſe woordes, <hi>one choſen afterwarde to rule the reſte,</hi> either make for no ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie of any one biſhop ouer all the churche, as apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinyng to euery Biſhop in his owne dioceſſe: or if M. Dorman will needes inforce a ſupremacie by the ſaied woordes, he ſhalbe inforced to confeſſe the ſaied ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie to be commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to the biſhop of Alexandria (where S. Hierome ſaith this one was choſen to rule the reſt) with the biſhop of Rome: as by the other place laſte be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore alleged by M. Dorman out of S. Cyprian, the ſaid
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:13729:53"/>
ſupremacie ſhould appertaine to the Biſhoppe of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage. But bothe Carthage, and Alexandria are nowe in the handes of Infideles, and therefore can there bee no ſupremacie of the church there: and yet aſwel there, as at Rome, where Chriſt is as muche blaſphemed, as he is either at Alexandria, or Carthage. But it is in deede moſte plaine by that epiſtle of S. Hierome, that he doeth not meane that one biſhoppe ſhould be aboue an other, muche leſſe, one heade ouer all other. For he expreſly ſaieth, that all biſhops be equall, and none ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, nor inferiour to an other by Gods lawe. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doeth it hurte our cauſe, in caſe that wée graunt to M. Dorman, that this place doeth appertaine to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles: and that one was choſen emongſt the Apoſtles themſelues to haue the chiefe place: that is, to ſpeake firſte, to moderate other, to ſtaie contention, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie ſchiſmes. Naie it maketh with vs directlie, who doo graunt that as emongeſt thoſe .xij. one was ſo cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen to bee ruler: ſo it is good, that in euery competente number of prieſts and cleargie, one be choſen likewiſe to be ruler. And if M. Dorman vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this graunt, would inferre ſuche a ſupremacie of one ouer the reſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, as the Pope claimeth ouer the churche: Saincte Paule reprouyng Peter more ſharplie to his face, then <note place="margin">

And for more reaſonable cauſe of exceptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to this Leo here, and all other Popes too, in this matter wee ſaie: that Zozimus or Soſimus biſhop of Rome about a. 24. ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res before this Leo, moued with an ambitious deſire of this ſupremacie, which the biſhops of Rome his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſours now ſtriue for, as it were, <hi>pro aris &amp; focis,</hi> for life and death, as one might ſaie, did corrupte and falſifie the decrees of the Nicene Councell, pretendyng that it was decreed in that Councell, that the biſhop of Rome ſhould be the chief iudge, aboue all other biſhops, &amp; that it ſhould be lawful for any ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnder any other biſhop, to appeale to the Biſhoppe of Rome, as to the higheſt iudge ouer all eccleſiaſticall perſones: and the ſaid Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zimus, as the maner of falſaries is, did counterfeite a decrée to that purpoſe, and put it in writyng, and labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to put it in executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by mainteinyng one <hi>Apiarius,</hi> a prieſt of the dioceſſe called Sicce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſis in Afrike, againſt his biſhop called Vrbanus: whiche <hi>Apiarius</hi> beyng by his ſaied biſhop, for his moſte wicked life excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, appealed to the ſaied Zozimus Biſhop of Rome.

Though Hoſius goeth about in vain to defende the cauſe of this corrupter, moſte impudently goyng about to prooue, that neither in Gréece, nor Afrike, nor els where, there was any true copie of the Nicene Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell remaining, but onely with the Biſhop of Rome: whiche how cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible it is, I leaue to the diſcreate readers iudgement. But of this matter M. Dorman geueth me occaſion to ſpeake more largely hereafter. After this Zozimus, his ſucceſſour Bonifacius the firſt, Celeſtine the firſt, with all others almoſte, folowyng Zozimus ſteppes and ambition, haue with toothe and naile ſtriuen for this ſupremacie: and for that purpoſe did ſticke ſtill to the falſified Nicene Canon, and haue likewiſe falſified other Councelles, in ſundrie places: and haue forged a great many of the epiſtles now abroade in the names of the olde Popes, Clemente, Anacletus, Euariſtus, Teleſphorus, and other their predeceſſours, whome thei make to write almoſte of nothyng els, but of the prerogatiue of Peters chaire, the ſee of Rome: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

And it maie ſeeme that if the Popes iudgemente bee aboue the Councell, as Pighius doth teache, the Councell did erre, in geuyng hym ſuche a title: and if the Councell in this poincte did well, as Pighius ſaieth, but M. Dorman denieth, either the Pope ſhould haue receiued the ſaid title offered, or not haue claimed the like of thoſe, who would not gladlie graunte it vnto him. Wherefore I truſt no reaſonable man will diſalowe our exceptions to ſuche witneſſes in their owne cauſe. Yet beſides theſe cauſes of moſte iuſte exceptions to this Pope, and all other Popes in their owne cauſe of their falſely vſurped ſupremacie, I will goe otherwiſe to woorke with M. Dorman.

And if mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Dorman thinke he can well enoughe frame this Iarre: I ſaie further, I will proue the ſaiynges of Leo vntrue, by twoo witneſſes, againſte this one: by indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferente witneſſes, againſt this partiall witneſſe in his owne cauſe: by witneſſes without and aboue all excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, againſte this witneſſe, vnto whom ſo many and ſo iuſte exceptions maie bee taken.

<pb facs="tcp:13729:60"/>
truthe, with Leo onely bearyng witneſſe to hymſelf. Leo ſaieth, <hi>In the holie Apoſtles themſelues there was a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of power, and that it was geuen to one to be aboue all the reſte.</hi> On the contrary parte S. Cyprian ſaith, The Lorde gaue like and equall authoritie to all his Apoſtles: all the Apoſtles bee indued with like fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip, bothe of honour, and power. Thus ſaieth S. Cyprian in his booke intitled <hi>De ſimplicitate praelato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> Of the ſimplicitis of prieſtes: noting them as dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble faced prelates, that teache, or attempt the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary. Againe Leo ſaieth: <hi>Out of this forme is taken our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of Biſhoppes, that in euery Prouince one bee chief and of moſte authoritie, and the biſhop of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cities to haue greater care, and conſeque<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly that he who ſitteth in Peters chaire, ſhould haue charge, &amp; be heade of the vniuerſall Churche.</hi> Thus ſaieth Leo: and thus he ſaieth, becauſe he hymſelf would be Lorde and head ouer all the churche. S. Cyprian ſaieth: Euery bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop hath his ſeuerall portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Chriſtes flocke to rule and gouerne, for the which he muſt geue an acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lorde. And that thoſe, who are vnder the charge of the biſhop of one countrey, maie not appeale to a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of an other: nor the cauſe determined by one Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, maie be called in queſtion before an other: for that the authoritie of one Biſhop is not inferiour to an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: nor the authoritie of the biſhop of Afrike is leſſe, then the authoritie of the biſhops of Italie, or Rome it ſelf (for his woordes haue euidentlie that relation) and that none thinke the authoritie of one biſhop to be leſſe then the authoritie of an other biſhop, but a fewe wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and deſperate men. Thus you ſee how your owne witneſſes are at ſquare, and there is, yea, and naie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twéene this your Leo, and S. Cypria<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in theſe matters.

worſhippyng one Chriſt, and obſeruyng one rule of truthe, are equall with the churche of Rome: all bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoppes bee the ſucceſſours of the Apoſtles, and of one prieſthoode, and of the ſame merite and dignitie. Thus ſaieth S. Hierome. But Leo ſaith contrary: <hi>that it was geuen to one to be aboue all the reſt, &amp; that thei, who be appoincted in greater dioceſſes or cities, haue more care and authoritie: and that th' onely ſee of Peter hath charge of the vniuerſall Churche, &amp; is heade therof.</hi> Thus ſaith Leo. S. Hierome ſaith: The leſſe dioceſſe or toune, or the poorer eſtate maketh not the biſhop lower, or leſſe in authoritie: the greater prouince, the greater citie, the greater riches make not a Biſhop greater in authoritie. And though Leo doo make neuer ſo muche of Rome, and ſet it aboue the vniuerſall Churche: S. Hierome ſaith, Th'authoritie of the vniuerſall churche is greater, then the authoritie of the churche of Rome, as the worlde is greater, then the citie of Rome. And he ſaith further: What dooeſt thou allege me the vſe of the one citie of Rome for a lawe of the churche, wherof ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth preſumption of a fewe againſt all men?

of the whiche twoo are moſte directlie againſte them, and againſte the thirde alſo, who alone ſeemeth to make with them: &amp; that thirde, as in his owne cauſe, to bee ſuſpected: and further to bee doubted alſo, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it bee he in deede, or an other vnder his name: and ſuche as he is, the woordes of his teſtimonie either ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtlie falſified, or els at the leaſt in diuers copies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng not onely diuers, but cleane contrarie? as hauyng in one copie, it is ſo, in an other (if M.

of euery biſhop in his owne dioceſſe, and for the obedience due vnto hym there. He dooeth neuer applie it, as dooeth M.

Whereof I inferre, that for auoydyng of ſchiſmes, and explication of doubles, euery churche of euery countrey and dioceſſe ought to haue an head, and a iudge to reſorte vnto. And as there is no confuſion in the worlde, nor diſcorde, for that ſundrie partes of the worlde haue ſundrie ciuill gouernours, as is moſte ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarie that thei haue, and is in the ſcriptures declared to be ſo by God appoincted: ſo is there no diſorder, that ſeuerall churches haue ſeuerall biſhoppes to their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, <note place="margin">

And ſo is that ſentence of Nazianzene generally take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, nothyng againſt the gouernance of ſeuerall biſhops in ſeuerall dioceſſes: no more then it is againſte the ciuill regiment of ſeuerall gouernours, in ſeueral countreis. For as it is apperteinyng to God onely, &amp; to our ſauior Chriſt his ſonne, by their almightie power &amp; wiſedome to gouerne all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, &amp; all the church: ſo is it enough, and to muche for any one man well to gouerne a little parcell therof. And ſo to returne to Nazianzene his ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng: <hi>VVhere is no rule, there is no order:</hi> Truthe it is: but where one Biſhop as one head, is in euery dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, there is ſome rule: therefore there is ſome order. <hi>VVhere many rule, there is ſeditio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:</hi> It is true, if many magiſtrates haue equall rule in one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, or if many eccleſiaſticall perſones haue equall authoritie in one ſeuerall Churche, wee confeſſe it is like to their phantaſie, who would haue many equall Goddes to rule the worlde. But one ſeuerall ruler in one ſeuerall dominion, one ſeuerall biſhop in one ſeuerall dioceſſe, dooe reſemble one God rulyng one whole worlde, and one Chriſt ruling one whole churche, ſo well as earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly creatures maie reſemble the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lie creatour. But one earthlic man by gouernyng all the whole worlde,
<pb facs="tcp:13729:72"/>
or the whole churche throughout the worlde to reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God or Chriſte, is a preſumption vnhearde of, but onelie in the Pope of Rome. Let therefore ſeuerall ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and Biſhoppes holde themſelues contented with ſeuerall dominions and dioceſſes, accordyng to Gods <note place="margin">

For it is falſe that ſuche ſeuerall rulers in ſeuerall places doo cauſe ſedition, and it is prooued falſe by the ciuile gouernemente of diuers rulers in diuers cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>treis, for ſo it ſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth for the moſte part throughout the worlde at this daie. Wherefore M. Dorman and D. Hardyng maie as well ſaie that the worlde is ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly gouerned by diuers princes, as the Churche by ſeuerall Biſhoppes.

               <p>M. Dorman is ſo mightie in reaſonyng, and hath ſo many and ſo good groundes, that he is full of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions as you ſée.

The aduerſaries of the Goſpell, who are the corrupters thereof, and would haue no corruption nor decaie of the Churche now noted or knowen, ſaie: although the Churche of God was obſcured, and brought to a little number in the old lawe, and in the ſhadowe, and figure, when no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was perfite: yet can it not be ſo in the time of the Goſpell, the tyme of grace and perfection, &amp;c.

Becauſe in this time ſith hereſies poſſeſſed thoſe Churches, there can bee no proofe of true chriſtianitie, neither can there be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther refuge of Chriſtians, deſiryng to knowe the true faithe, but the diuine ſcriptures. For before it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by many meanes, whiche was the true churche, and whiche was Gentilitie: but now, thei who would knowe whiche is the true churche, can knowe it by no meanes, but onelie by the ſcriptures. Why ſo? For all theſe thinges, whiche are properly Chriſtes in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> truth, the ſame hath hereſie alſo in ſchiſme. Hereſie hath chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches likewiſe, and the diuine Scriptures likewiſe: Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops likewiſe, and other orders of clearkes: Baptiſme likewiſe, the ſacramente of thankes geuyng likewiſe, and all other thinges: to conclude, euen Chriſt himſelf. He therefore that would knowe, whiche is the true churche of Chriſt, how can he knowe it in ſo greate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of likelihoode, but onely by the ſcriptures? Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the churche of Chriſt might be knowen before by the maners of it, when the conuerſation either of all, or of the moſte parte of Chriſtians was holie, whiche was not ſo emongeſt the wicked. But now Chriſtians are become either ſuche, or woorſe then be the heretikes or Gentiles: yea there is greater continencie emongeſte them, though thei bee in ſchiſme, then is emongeſt the Chriſtians. He therefore that would knowe whiche is the true Churche of Chriſte, how can he knowe it, but onelie by the ſcriptures? The Lorde therefore know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng that in the laſt daies there would be ſo greate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of thinges, dooeth commaunde that Chriſtians, whiche be in Chriſtianitie, willyng to haue the ſuertie of true faithe, dooe flie to no other thing but to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

Thus farre that aunciente author: whoſe ſentence and verie woordes, though for auoidyng of prolixitie alittle intermitted, I haue truely rehearſed. You maie ſee that this auncient writer will not allowe, that you beeyng the one partie ſhould claime to your ſelf the name of Chriſtians, the name of the churche, the names of biſhops, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes of the cleargie, and ſo to take vpon you as iudges to condemne the other partie: but that bothe you and wee muſt be iudged and tried whether we be in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianitie, and in the true church, by the ſcriptures. You ſee the names of the churche, of Biſhops and cleargie, whiche are common to heretikes with Chriſtians, can not prooue you to bee catholikes, for that heretikes vſe the ſame names: but that bothe you and wee muſte knowe by the Scriptures, whether wee bee in the true faithe, or no: for that (as he ſaieth) in this confuſion of thinges bothe the true churche, and the true faith muſt bee knowen by the Scriptures onelie, and by no other thyng: and that whoſoeuer goeth aboute otherwiſe to knowe them, ſhall ſtumble and periſhe. Wherein this author dooeth agree with S. Auguſtine, S. Hierome, S. Chryſoſtome, and with all the olde Doctours of the auncient churche. Whereby al men maie well vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande, that it is not our newe opinion (as M. Dorman would haue it ſeme) but the olde true perſwaſion of all the auncient doctors and godly fathers of the primitiue churche, that the Scriptures, as moſte indifferent and certaine, ought to be iudges in controuerſies in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, rather then Doctours, then Councelles, then your Churche, then dead menne, then angelles, yea that the ſcriptures ſhould bee iudge, and not thei. And that the true ſenſe of ſcriptures, if doubte riſe thereof, maie bee
<pb facs="tcp:13729:84"/>
and muſt be gathered by the conference of the ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res, who doo clearly expounde themſelues. For the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration whereof the ſaid doctors doo ſo often and lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gely write, that the reherſall thereof would fil an huge volume: but I did thinke that this much would ſuffice. But you Papiſtes will neuer allowe the Scripture as iudge, nor the ſenſe thereof to be certaine, vntill it come to the expoſition of the Churche: and you will bee that churche, that muſt ſo expounde it, your ſelf: that is, you will grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t no ſenſe to be true, but your own ſenſe. But wee deny that you are the true Churche, that hath this autoritie of determinyng of the ſenſe of the ſcriptures. And if you will ſaie ſtill, your are the churche, &amp; neither will, nor can proue it, but onely by ſo ſaiyng, we be not ſo voide of all ſenſe and vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, but that we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue you will haue no ſenſe but your owne, and that you will be ſtill, bothe parties and iudges in your own cauſes againſte vs, as the Iuiſhe high Prieſte, Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeis, and Scribes would needes be againſt Chriſt and his Apoſtles: who did (by your iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, as it ſemeth) allege the ſcriptures for themſelues againſte the ſaied high Prieſte, Scribes and Phariſeis in vaine, for that thei being the churche, as you now be, were the iudges of the ſenſe of the ſaied ſcriptures by Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles alleged. And I am ſure that the high Prieſte, with his Iuiſhe churche, was able to ſaie as muche for the ordinarie ſucceſſion of the high Prieſtes his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours, euen from Aaron vntil his time, for antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, for conſente, and for vniuerſalitie, againſte Chriſte and his Apoſtles (ſo fewe in compariſon, and, as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, latelie ſtarte vp): as you are able to ſaie for your churche, or againſt vs. But yet we doo thinke that the woorde of God, as it was alleged by Chriſte and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles againſt the ſaied high prieſt, and his churche, ſo
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:13729:84"/>
maie it and ought alſo to be alleged by vs, againſt your high prieſt, and your churche: and that the ſame woords of God whiche ſhal iudge bothe you &amp; vs in the worlde to come, as is ſaied, ought alſo to be iudge betwéen you and vs here in this tranſitorie worlde: for ſo dooeth our ſauiour Chriſt teache, ſo doo S.

Hierome, with all the auncient doctors of the Churche teache alſo, as hath been partely beſore ſpecified, crie you neuer ſo muche to the contrarie, and make you neuer ſo many exceptions to the ſcriptures, and claime vnto your ſelues, as beyng the churche, the interpretatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thereof: yet ſuche are both your doctrine, and dooynges, and ſo contrarie to the woorde of God, (whervpon the true churche is builded) that we muſte needes thinke that you are not the true church of God. And whether you ſo bee or no, ſeeyng it is in queſtion, and a greater doubte and controuerſie emongeſt men, I am ſure, then can bee about the ſenſe of any place of the ſcripture, you ſhall neuer bee able to make any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception vnto the Scripture, as no competent iudge in controuerſies, but we ſhall be able tenne tymes more to make exception to your Pope, and his churche, as no indifferent nor meete iudge. Wherefore ceaſe once to bragge of that, as the vndoubted iudge of all doubtes, whiche is it ſelf emongeſt men, of all other doubtes the greateſt doubt: that is, whether you be the true church of God, or no. Whiche is with vs in deede no doubte, nor with any that hath any vnderſtandyng in Goddes woorde, and iudgemente in true religion. For we cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainlie knowe by the woorde of God, vpon the whiche as the true churche is builded, ſo is it by the ſame to be knowen, that you bee not the churche of God, for that you ſo ſwarue from the woorde of God. As for vs, that wee are at your handes, though we bryng ſo euidente

Wherefore, M.

And therefore we doubt nothing, but al wiſe indifferent readers will plainly perceiue, that ye lie moſte ſhamefully, and will abhorre and deteſt your malice, an deride and hiſſe out your blindeneſſe, who thought them ſo blinde that thei could iudge no colours: and your partiall readers will bluſhe, I doubte not, at your doultiſhe dooynges, and peraduenture beſhrowe your harte, or rather your foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhe heade, that hath handled their parte in ſuche ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſorte.

                  <hi>quomodo profertur à catholicis, eſt verbum dei: quomodo profertur ab haereticis, eſt verbum diaboli.</hi> The ſcripture as it is alleged or vttered by the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes (to witte Papiſtes) is the woorde of God: but as it is vttered of heretikes (meaning vs) it is the woorde of the Deuill. Thus would Hoſius, by a leude imitation of ſaincte Hieromes woordes vſed in his vehemencie, perſwade the people to thinke that the Scripture vtte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by any, but Papiſtes onelie, is the woorde of the deuill. But the Scripture of it ſelf is euer Gods woorde in deede, though the abuſe thereof bee Deuiliſhe: and therefore Hoſius by hatred of the Scripture, ouerrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching hymſelf, dooeth in deede ſpeake thus of it vntru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie. And as the Scripture is neither noſe of waxe, nor Leaden rule, nor the woorde of the deuill, for that it pleaſeth Pighius, or Hoſius ſo to name it: no more are wee heretikes, for that it pleaſeth them, and other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries maliciouſlie ſo to terme vs: neither bee thei themſelues by and by Catholikes, becauſe thei falſelie ſo miſname themſelues. It is not their onelie ſaiyng, and proouyng of nothyng, that can make either vs to bee, that we bee not, or them not to bee that, whiche in deede thei are, the verie Synagoge of Satan: whiche is by the light of Goddes woorde made manifeſte, and prooued in ſuche ſorte now in our daies, that a good parte of the Chriſtian worlde perſwaded thereby, hath forſaken their Satanicall ſecte of Papiſtrie, and ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned

themſelues to the ſincere doctrine of the Goſpell: whereof riſeth all this their deadlie hatred, and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous miſnamyng of the Scripture.

Wherefore the Papiſtes are not onely in blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous woordes againſt the ſcriptures like to <hi>Suenk<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>feldius,</hi> who compareth it to other Goddes creatures: but in ſcoffing againſt the woorde of God in ſuche abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable ſort, and comparyng it to ſuche leude inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes and madde members, as are leaden rules, and ware<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> noſes, are more horriblie blaſphemous, then euer was <hi>Suenkfeldius.</hi> And whereas Pighius had a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall noſe, and other me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers of his bodie, by the vertue of Gods woorde, and yet in mockage dooeth compare Gods woorde ſo beneficiall to him, to a noſe of waxe, by his ſwiniſhe tongue vttring ſuche blaſphemous woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, it is greate pitie, that he had not had accordyng to his Pighiſhe name, an hoggiſhe groine in ſteede of his noſe, &amp; a ſwiniſh body accordingly: that he might alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as he was hoggiſh in minde, ſo likewiſe in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde ſhape of bodie alſo, haue anſwered fullie to his

Nowe concerninge Hoſius his great learninge, it is not without cauſe that M. Dorman dooeth ſo excéedingly auance it. For as M. Dorman hath borowed this his booke of D. Harding, ſo hath D. Harding borowed all this his and your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Popes ſupremacie of Hoſius: And Hoſius hath borowed it of Pighius Hierarchie, and Pighius hath borowed it of dronken Eckius, the founder of all theſe mattiers in our dayes. And moſt true it is, that there is not one reaſon, nor authoritie almoſt in all that great volume of Hoſius againſt Brentius, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining fiue ſeuerall bookes, but that he hath had out of Pighius Hierarchie, and <hi>Alphonſus de haereſibus,</hi> after whiche ſorte any meane man may bee counted learned. This I am hable to prooue as true, as I
<pb facs="tcp:13729:102"/>
haue hithertoo, I truſt, prooued you M. Dorman a lier in all you haue hitherto written, and doubt nothing ſo to procéede with you to thende of your leude lies, laden in this your Lighter of falſe fables. Wherfore Hoſius deſerueth the name of the Compilator, rather than the author of that great booke, wrytten againſt Brentius litle booke, intitled <hi>Prolegomena,</hi> for that he hath ſtolen all his authorities, and reaſons out of the ſayde Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghius his Hierachie, and <hi>Alphonſus de Haereſibus,</hi> as all learned reading the ſayde bookes ſhall moſt eaſely and plainly perceiue. Yea and in compilyng them together, it is iudged vpon probable coniectures, by the ſtyle and poeticall phraſes, and verſes vnmeete for Hoſius age and vocation, that as he hath borowed the mater of his bookes, ſo hath he had the helpe of other in pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſame: and yet may he well call the bookes his owne, as bought with his owne money, and large rewardes beſtowed vpon his ſtyle wrightes.</p>
               <p>Concerninge his great vertue, though I know not his life, yet I iudge it a woorthie mattier for M. Dorman his commendation, and him ſelfe woorthie of the court of Rome.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:13729:116"/>
Hierome a Prieſte of Rome &amp;c. ioigned hymſelf in communion to his owne biſhoppe Damaſus, <hi>Ergo</hi> we Engliſhemen muſie ioigne our ſelues likewiſe to the biſhoppe of Rome that now is, beyng bothe a forainer and an enemie.

Naie, it foloweth rather thus: As ſaincte Hierome refuſed to ioigne hymſelf to <hi>Vitalis</hi> biſhoppe of Antiochia, and an Arrian, bothe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was a ſtraunger, and alſo an heretike, and ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gned hymſelf to Damaſus his owne Biſhoppe, and a godlie Biſhop: ſo ought wée to refuſe the Pope, beyng bothe a foraine vſurper, and a falſe heretike, &amp; to ioigne againſte hym, with our owne godlie biſhops at home. But (will M. Dorman ſaie) ſaincte Hierome addeth a cauſe (whiche is the pith of the matter) ſaiyng thus: <hi>Super illam petram, &amp;c. I knowe that vpon that rocke [Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters chaire] the Churche is builded:</hi> whiche is the cauſe why S. Hierome ioigned with Damaſus, will he ſaie. But he maie be aſhamed, had he any ſhame at al, thus ſhamefully by a falſe parentheſis to intermingle theſe woordes <hi>[Peters chaire]</hi> in this ſentence of S. Hierome, and ſo to falſifie it, as though S. Hierome had ſaied, or ment in this place, that the Popes chaire is the rocke, whereon the Churche is builded. And now maie ye ſee to what ende all M. Dormans long former drifte com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, to witte, to bryng vs from the ſcriptures to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters chaire, that is, the Popes conſiſtorie, there to bee iudged, whiche now at the laſte, after ſo long ſuſpenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and delaie, vnder S.

Quicunque extra hanc domum agnum comederit, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanus eſt. Si quis in Arca Nohae non fuerit, peribit regnante diluuio.</hi> That is to ſaie, Let enuie auoide, let the ambition of the height of Rome departe, I ſpeake to the ſucceſſour of the fiſher, and a diſciple of the croſſe. I folowyng no chief or head, but Chriſt, am ioigned in communion to your holines, to ſaie, Peters chaire: v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that rocke, I knowe the Churche to bee builded: whoſoeuer eateth the Lambe without this houſe, he is prophane or vnholie. If one be not in the arke of Nohe, he ſhall periſhe when the floud is aloft. Thus farre S. Hierome. Now if a manne would aſke of M. Dorman why he left out thoſe twoo lines, wherein S. Hierome admoniſheth Damaſus, as the ſucceſſour of the poore fiſher Peter, to laie aſide all ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whiche the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the citie of Rome might mooue hym too, and withall affirmeth that he will folowe no chief head but Chriſte (whiche woordes are ioigned, and by a partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple dependyng to that, whiche M. Dorman alleged) whatſoeuer he ſhall anſwere thereto, I knowe the true anſwere: M. Dorman did of falſehood, and corruption of the meanyng of ſainct Hierome, thus detrunke and mangle his ſentence: for he did ſée that S. Hierome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing Damaſus of humilitie, and withall profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyng hymſelf to folowe no chief or head but Chriſt, not exceptyng Damaſus caſe, but rather affirmyng hym not to be <hi>Primum,</hi> the chief, maketh clearely with vs, who in this controuerſie of the Popes vſurped ſupre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie ſaie the ſame: We folow no head but Chriſt: we
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:13729:117"/>
ioigne in communion with none, but ſuche as folowe hym &amp;c. Furthermore he did ſee that the woordes of S. Hierome folowyng <hi>(vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this rocke I know the church to bee builded)</hi> might and ought to bee referred vnto Chriſte, mentioned by S. Hierome ſo nere before, and by Peter co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed to be that rocke, wheron the churche is builded: and therefore M. Dorman left out of ſaincte Hieromes ſentence the me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tion of Chriſt, that he might moſt falſly and blaſphemouſly referre the rocke to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters chaire, as though Peters rotten chaire, or ruinous Rome were the rocke, whereon the churche of our ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior Chriſt is builded. And to make the purpoſed wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſſe of theſe aduerſaries of the verie rocke Chriſte and his truthe (who care not what thei allege for the maintenaunce of their deſperate cauſe of the Popes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie, though the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues dooe knowe it ſerueth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for their purpoſe at all) more manifeſte to all the worlde, I lette the reader vnderſtande, that Eraſmus in his ſcholies or annotations vpon this epiſtle (whiche M.

Thus farre Eraſmus. It pleaſeth M.

before he was called Simon) but this name, that he ſhould be called Peter, was geuen him of the Lorde: to th'ende, that by that figure he might ſignifie y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> churche. For becauſe Chriſte is <hi>Petra,</hi> the Rocke: <hi>Petrus</hi> is the Chriſtian people. For, <hi>Petra</hi> is the principal name: and therefore <hi>Petrus</hi> cometh of <hi>Petra,</hi> and not <hi>Petra</hi> of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trus:</hi> as <hi>Chriſtus,</hi> Chriſte, is not named <hi>à Chriſtiano,</hi> of a Chriſtian, but <hi>Chriſtianus,</hi> a Chriſtian, is named of <hi>Chriſtus,</hi> Chriſt. Therefore ſaith Chriſt, Thou art Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and vpon this rocke which thou haſt confeſſed, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this rocke whiche thou haſt knowen, ſaiyng, Thou art Chriſte the ſonne of the liuyng God, I will builde my churche: that is, vpon my ſelf, beyng the ſonne of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng God will I builde my churche.

And the Apoſtle Paule whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he did knowe that he was choſen or preferred, and Chriſt deſpiſed by ſome men, ſaied: is Chriſte diuided? Was Paule crucified for you? Or were you Baptized in the name of Paule? And as not in Paules name, no more were ye baptized in the name of Peter, but in the name of Chriſt, that Peter might be builded vpon the rocke, not the rocke vpon Peter, and ſo foorthe.

You ſee that Peter is here the figure of the whole Churche, in makyng his confeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, not of the churche of Rome one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: you ſee that as Chriſte is the rocke, ſo repreſenteth Peter the chriſtian people, and not the people of Rome onely, muche leſſe the Pope onely: you ſee that <hi>Petrus,</hi> to ſaie, the Churche, is builded vpon <hi>Petra,</hi> Chriſt: and not <hi>Petra,</hi> Chriſte, builded vpon <hi>Petrus,</hi> Peter: you ſee that ſuche as will haue Peter beyng a man, to be their rocke to builde vpon, bee ſectaries and heretikes, diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng them ſelues from Chriſte, deſpiſyng hym, and chooſyng men: and that thei onely be true Chriſtians, whiche wil not builde vpon Peter, nor vpon any other man, but vpon the rocke onely, whiche is Chriſt hym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: you ſee, thei that builde vpon Peter maie ſaie, I holde of Cephas, whiche is Peter: but thei that builde vpon the rocke maie ſaie, I holde, or I am of Chriſte. Wherefore I conclude, that all that builde vpon the Pope, or his chaire, as it were vpon the rocke, as thei bée called, ſo bee thei in deede Papiſtes, not Chriſtians: as were all thoſe falſe orders of hypocrites, who forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng to builde vpon the rocke Chriſt, and buildyng v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon men woorſe then Peter, Paule, or Apollo, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande tymes, forſooke to ſaie, <hi>Ego ſum Chriſti,</hi> I am of Chriſt, I am a Chriſtian: and ſaied, <hi>Ego Franciſcanus, ego Dominicanus &amp;c.</hi> I am of Franciſce, I am of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minike, a Franciſcane, a Dominicane, a Bernardine, yea an Auguſtinian, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to this doctrine of S.

A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, the cauſe why ſaincte Hierome did not knowe, but reiected, <hi>Vitalis, Meletius,</hi> and <hi>Paulinus,</hi> was not for that thei did not ſubmitte them ſelues to Damaſus as to the ſupreme head of the Churche, or for that cauſe tooke them to bee enemies, as maiſter Dorman would haue it ſeeme (for there was no ſuche matter then in queſtion) but becauſe thei did not agree with Dama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus in the truthe, but taughte falſelie of the greateſte poinctes of our religion, and would haue wrapped the ſame in obſcure and ſtrange termes, therby to deceiue the more, therefore did ſainct Hierome not knowe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

And ſo ſome writer in fauour of him, by like, that was choſen, and kept reſidence at Rome, hath written this againſt ſome other, that vſurped Peters ſeate: and ſo they beynge many at one time, troubled the order of the ſucceſſion of one, after an other, begunne at Peter, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, till ſuch diſcorde came in by thoſe, who ſettinge vp an other chaire, and ſo not ſitting in Peters chaire, ſate (as he ſaieth) in the chaire of peſtilence. Howſoeuer it be, the mater can not be applied to vs, who doo not v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpe Peters chaire.

a liue monſtre: or the whole worlde hauing God to his head, is therefore a dead truncke, becauſe it hath no one onely earthly head, nor can haue any ſuch: no more can the vniuerſall churche, throughout the whole worlde haue any ſuche one earthly head. Wherefore, as M.

For M. Dorman can not be ignorant, that wée in all our Sermons and writinges of ſuche mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, dooe make a moſte cleare and euident difference
<pb facs="tcp:13729:133"/>
between the functions and offices of princes, ciuill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, and Prieſtes Eccleſiaſticall miniſters: And neither did we euer teache that Princes ought, neither did they euer deſire, to execute the offices Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call of miniſtring the Sacramentes, preachinge, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicatinge, abſoluinge, and ſuche like. Wherfore you doo lewdly, and impudently abuſe your ſelf M.

For whan all this is graunted you, what haue you obteined: or what haue we loſt? Is it not well and plainely declared by the examples of kyng Dauid, Salomon, Ioſaphat, Ezechias, and Ieſias, that princes haue authoritie in gouerning of the Cleargie, &amp; churche matters, though they may not execute all eccleſiaſticall functions and offices? What though our moſt gracious ſoueraigne Ladie, beynge a woman, haue not ſo great ſkill in feates of warre, as haue hir capitaines: haue not ſo good knowledge in the lawes of hir realme, as hir Iuſtices, and other learmed men in the lawes haue: (though ſhe haue in all good learning, and in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures too more knowledge, then had any of your Popes this ſeuen hundreth yeres I beleue, and therefore no lette in that poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

may with as good reaſon dooe it, as you woulde take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way hir ſuperioritie ouer hir clergie from hir, for that ſhe can not, may not, nor will not execute eccleſiaſticall functions. Though the quéenes maieſtie haue not that vnderſtanding of all the affaires of hir realme, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in all thinges, that actiuitie in executing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that hath the whole body of hir moſt honorable Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell, yet doothe the whole body of hir Councell, though moſt honorable, humblie acknowledge hir to be their head: onely proude Prieſtes, becauſe ſome thinges are incident to their office, whiche the Prince may not, nor liſte not to dooe, refuſe their ſoueraigne to be their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame gouernour. Let the biſhoppes be the Queenes Maieſties moſt godly Councell in matters of religion, (and I pray God they may ſo be) as is the other moſte honorable Councell in ciuill matters: but let that god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Councel, as well as that moſt honorable Councel, be vnder the godly and moſte highe honorable Prince, as ſuperiour to them both.
