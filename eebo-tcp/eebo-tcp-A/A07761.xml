            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T seemes to
mee strange,
and a thing
much to bee
marueiled, that the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borer
to repose himself
hasteneth as it were the
course of the Sun: that
<pb facs="tcp:13715:3"/>
the Mariner rows with
al force t'attain the port
&amp; with a ioyfull cry sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutes
the descried land:
that the traueller is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
quiet nor content til
hee beat the end of his
voyage: and that we in
the meane while tyed
in this world to a perpe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tuall
taske, tossed with
continuall te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pest, tyred
with a rough and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bersom
way, cannot yet
see the end of our labor
but with griefe, nor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
our port but with
tears, nor approche our
home and quiet abode
but with horrour and
<pb facs="tcp:13715:3"/>
trembling. This life is
but a <hi>Penelopes</hi> webbe,
wherein we are alwaies
doing &amp; vndoing: a sea
ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to all winds, which
somtime within, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
without neuer ceas
to torment vs: a wearie
iourny through extream
heats, &amp; colds, ouer high
mountains, steep rocks,
&amp; theeuish deserts. And
so wee tearme it, in wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
at this web, in ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing
at this oar, in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
this miserable way:
yet lo whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> death comes
to end our work, when
shee stretcheth out her
armes to pull vs into
<pb facs="tcp:13715:4"/>
the port, when after so
many dangerous passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
and loathsome lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings
she would co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>duct
vs to our true home and
resting place: in stead of
reioycing at the end of
our labor, of taking co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
at the sight of our
land, of singing at the
approach of our happie
mansion, we would fain
(who would beleeue it?)
retake our vvorke in
hand, we would againe
hoise saile to the winde,
and willingly vndertake
our iourney anew. No
more, then, remember
we our paines, our ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks
<pb facs="tcp:13715:4"/>
and dangers are
forgotten: we feare no
more the trauelles nor
the theeues. Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise,
wee apprehende
death as an extreame
paine, wee doubt it as a
rocke, wee flie it as a
thiefe. Wee do as little
children, who al the day
complaine, and when
the medicin is brought
them, are no longer
sicke: as they, who (all
the weeke long) runne
vp &amp; downe the streets
with paine of the teeth,
and seeing the Barber
comming to pull them
out, feel no more pain:
<pb facs="tcp:13715:5"/>
as those tender and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
bodies, who in a
pricking pleurisie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine,
cry out, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
stay for a Surgion,
and when they see him
whetting his Launcet
to cut the throat of the
disease, pul in their arms
&amp; hide them in the bed,
as if hee were come to
kill them. Wee feare
more the cure then the
disease, the Surgion the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the pain, the stroke the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the impostume. Wee
haue more sense of the
medicines bitternesse
soone gone, then of a
bitter languishing long
<pb facs="tcp:13715:5"/>
continued: more fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of death the end of
our miseries, then the
endlesse miserie of our
life. And whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
this folly and
simplicitie? we neither
knowe life, nor death.
We fear that we ought
to hope for, and wish
for that wee ought to
feare. Wee call life a
continuall death: and
death the issue of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
death, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of a neuer dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
life. Now what
good, I pray you, is ther
in life, that wee should
so much pursue it? or
<pb facs="tcp:13715:6"/>
what euill is there in
death, that wee should
so much eschue it? Nay
what euill is there not
in life? and what good
is there not in death?
Consider al the periods
of this life. We enter it
in teares, wee passe it in
sweate, wee ende it in
sorrowe. Great and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
rich and poore, not
one in the whole world
that can plead immuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
from this condition.
Man, in this point worse
then all other creatures,
is borne vnable to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
himselfe; neyther
receiuing in his first
<pb facs="tcp:13715:6"/>
yeares any pleasure, nor
giuing to others but an<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>noy
and displeasure, and
before the age of discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
passing infinit dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: only herein le<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>
vnhappie then in other
ages, that hee hath no
sense nor apprehension
of his vnhappinesse.
Now, is there anie so
weake minded, that if it
were graunted him to
liue alwayes a childe,
would make account of
such a life? So then it is
euident, that not simply
to liue is a good; but wel
and happilie to liue. But
proceed. Growes hee?
<pb facs="tcp:13715:7"/>
with him grow his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailes.
Scarcely is hee
come out of his nurses
hands, scarcely knowes
what it is to play, but he
falleth into the subiectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
of some schoolemaster.
I speake but of those
which are best &amp; most
precisely broght vp: Stu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dies
he? it is euer with re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pining.
Playes hee? ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
but with feare. This
whole age, while hee is
vnder the charge of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
is vnto him but as
a prison: he only thinks,
and only aspires to that
time whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> freed from the
mastership of another,
<pb facs="tcp:13715:7"/>
he may become master
of himself; pushing on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
(as much as in him
lyes) his age with his
shoulder, that soone he
may enioy his hoped li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
Inshort, he desires
nothing more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> end
of this base age, and the
beginning of his youth.
And what else I pray
you is the beginning of
youth, but the death of
infancie? the beginning
of manhood, but the
death of youth? the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of to morrow,
but the death of to day?
In this sort then desires
he his death, &amp; iudgeth
<pb facs="tcp:13715:8"/>
his life miserable: and
so ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not be reputed in
any happinesse or con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tentment.
Behold him
now, according to his
wish, at liberty: in that
age, wherein <hi>Hercules</hi>
had the choise, to take
the way of vertue or of
vice, reason or passion
for his guide, and of
these two must take
one. His passion enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
him with'a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
delights, prepares
for him a thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d baits,
presentes him with a
thousand worldly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
to surprize him:
and fewe there are that
<pb facs="tcp:13715:8"/>
are not beguiled. But
at the reckonings ende,
what pleasures are they?
pleasures full of vice,
which holde him still in
a restlesse feauer: plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
subiect to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
like sweete meats
of hard digestion: plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
bought with pain
and peril, spent and past
in a moment, and follo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
with a long &amp; loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som
remorse of consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
And this is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
nature (if they be wel
examined) of al the plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sures
of this world. Ther
is in none so much sweet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes,
but ther is more bit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ternes: <pb facs="tcp:13715:9"/>
none so pleasant
to the mouth, but leavs
an vnsauoury after-taste
and loathsome disdain:
none (which is worse) so
moderated but hath his
corrosiue, &amp; caries his pu<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nishment
in it self. I will
not here speak of the dis<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pleasures
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fessed by al,
as quarelles, debates,
woundes, murthers, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments,
sicknesse, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril,
wherinto sometimes
the incontinency, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> insolency of this
ill guided age conducts
him. But if those that
seeme pleasures, be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
els but displeasurs:
<pb facs="tcp:13715:9"/>
if the sweetnes therof be
as an infusion of worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood;
it is plain enough
what the displeasure
is they feele, and how
great the bitternes that
they taste. Behold in
sum the life of a young
man, who rid of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
of his parents,
abandons himselfe to
all liberty or rather bo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
of his passion:
which, right like an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane
spirit possessing
him, casts him now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the water, now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the fire: sometimes
carries him cleane ouer
a rocke, and sometime
<pb facs="tcp:13715:10"/>
flings him headlong to
the bottome. Now, if
he take and follow rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
for his guide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
on the other part
wonderfull difficulties:
he must resolue to fight
in euery parte of the
field, at euery step to be
in conflict, and at hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strokes;
as hauing his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
in front, in flanke,
and on the rerewarde,
neuer leauing to assaile
him. And what enimie?
al that can delight him,
all that hee sees neer, or
far off; brieflie the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
enemy of the world,
the world it selfe: But
<pb facs="tcp:13715:10"/>
which is worse, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
treacherous and
daungerous intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
among his own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
&amp; his passion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
himselfe desperate:
which, in that age
grown to the highest, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waits
but time, houre, &amp;
occasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to surprize him
&amp; cast him into all vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes.
God onely and
none other can make
him choose this way:
God only can hold him
in it to the end: God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
can make him victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
in all his combates.
And well wee see how
fewe they are that enter
<pb facs="tcp:13715:11"/>
into it, and of those few
how many that retire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.
Followe the one
way or followe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he must either sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
himself to a tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicall
passion, or vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
a weary &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual
combate, willingly cast
himself to destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or
fetter himself as it were
in stocks, easily sink with
the course of the water,
or painfully swimme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the streame. Loe
here the yong m<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who
in his youth hath drunk
his full draught of the
worlds vain &amp; deceiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
pleasures, ouertake<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <pb facs="tcp:13715:11"/>
by them with such a
dull heauinesse, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonishment,
as drunke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards
the morrow after a
feaste: either so out of
taste, that hee will no
more; or so glutted, that
he can no more: not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
without griefe to
speak, or think of them.
Loe him that stoutely
hath made resistance:
hee feeles himselfe so
wearie, and with this
continuall conflicte so
brused and broken, that
either hee is vpon the
point to yeeld himself,
or content to die, and so
acquit himselfe. And
<pb facs="tcp:13715:12"/>
this is all the good, all
the contentment of this
florishing age, by chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
so earnestly desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
and by olde folkes
so heartilie lamented.
Nowe commeth that
which is called perfect
age; in the which men
haue no other thoughts
but to purchase them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
wisdome and rest.
Perfect indeed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
onely perfect, that all
imperfections of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
nature, hidden
before vnder the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of childhood or the
lightnesse of youth, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
at this age in their
<pb facs="tcp:13715:12"/>
perfection, We speake
of none in this place but
such as are esteemed
the wisest, &amp; most hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in the conceit of the
world. Wee played as
you haue seene in feare:
our shorte pleasures
were attended on with
long repentance. Be
hold, now present them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to vs auarice, and
ambition; promising, if
wee will adore them,
perfect contentment of
the goods and honours
of this world. And sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ther are none but the
ture Children of the
Lord, who by the faire
<pb facs="tcp:13715:13"/>
illusions of the one or
the other cast not them
selues headlong from
the top of the pinnacle.
But in the end, what is
all this contentment?
The couetous man
makes a thousand voia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
by sea and by land:
runnes a thousand for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes:
escapes a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
shipwracks, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
feare and trauel:
and many times hee ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
loseth his time, or
gayneth nothing but
sicknesses, gouts, &amp; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pilatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
for the time to
come In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purchase of
this goodly repose, hee
<pb facs="tcp:13715:13"/>
bestoweth his true rest;
and, to gaine wealth,
loseth his life. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
hee hath gained in
good quantitie: that hee
hath spoyled the whole
East of pearles, and dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen
drie all the mines
of the West: will hee
therefore bee settled in
quiet? can hee say that
he is content? All char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and iourneyes past,
by his passed paines hee
heapeth vp but future
disquietnesse both of
minde and body; from
one trauell falling into
nother, neuer ending,
but changing his mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.
<pb facs="tcp:13715:14"/>
Hee desired to
haue them, and now
feares to lose them: he
got them with burning
ardour, &amp; possesseth in
trembling cold: hee ad<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tured
among theeues
to seek them; &amp; hauing
found them, theeues &amp;
robbers on al sides, run
mainely on him: he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oured
to digge them
out of the earth, and
now is inforced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligge,
and rehide them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Finally, comming from
al his voiages, he comes
into a prison: and for an
end of his bodily trauels
is taken with endlesse
<pb facs="tcp:13715:14"/>
trauels of the mind. And
what, at length, hath
this poore soule attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
after so many mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries?
This Diuell of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerise,
by his illusions,
&amp; enchantments, bears
him in hand that hee
hath some rare and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
thing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so it
fareth with him, as
with those silly crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the Diuel se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
vnder colour of
relieuing their pouerty,
who finde their hands
full of leaues, supposing
to finde them full of
crownes. He possesseth
or rather is possessed by
<pb facs="tcp:13715:15"/>
a thing, wherein is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
force nor vertue;
more vnprofitable, and
more base, then the
least hearb of the earth:
Yet hath he heaped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
this vile excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and so brurish is
grown, as therewith to
crowne his head, which
naturally hee shoulde
tread vnder his feet. But
howsoeuer it be, is hee
therwith content? Nay
(co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>irariwise) lesse now,
then euer. We co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mend
most, those drinkes that
breede an alteration,
and soonest extinguish
thirst: and those meats,
<pb facs="tcp:13715:15"/>
which in least quantitie
do longest resist hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger.
Now hereof the more a
man drinkes, the more
he is a thirst; the more
hee eates, the more an
hungred: It is a dropsie
(and as they tearme it)
the dogs hunger: soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
may hee burst then
be satisfied. And (which
is worse) so strange in
some is this thirst, that
it maketh them dig the
pittes, and painefully
draw the water, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
will not suffer them
to drinke. In the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
of a riuer they are
drie with thirst: and on
<pb facs="tcp:13715:16"/>
a heap of corne cry out
of famine: they haue
goods and dare not vse
them: they haue ioyes
it seemes, and doe not
enioy the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: they neither
haue for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues nor
for another: but of all
they haue, they haue
nothing: and yet haue
wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of al they haue not.
Let vs then returne to
that that the attaining
of all these deceiueable
goods is nothing else
but wearinesse of body;
&amp; the possession for the
most part, but weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the mind: which
certainely is so much
<pb facs="tcp:13715:16"/>
the greater, as is more
sensible, more subtile,
and more tender the
soule then the body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But
the heap of al misery is,
when they come to lose
them; when either ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack,
or sacking or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uasion,
or fire, or such
like calamities, to which
these fraile thinges are
subiect, doth take and
carie them from them.
Then fall they to crie, to
weep, &amp; to torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t them
selues, as little children
that haue lost their plai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>game;
which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
is nothing
worth. One cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
<pb facs="tcp:13715:17"/>
them, that mortal
me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue any other good
in this world, but that
which is mortall. They
are in their owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits
not onely spoyled,
but altogether slayed.
And, forasmuch as in
these vaine things they
haue fixt al their hopes;
hauing lost them, they
fall into despaire, out of
the which commonly
they cannot bee with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawen.
And (which is
more) al, that they haue
not gained according
to the accountes they
made, they esteem lost:
all that, which turnes
<pb facs="tcp:13715:17"/>
them not to greate and
extraordinarie profite,
they account as da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage:
whereby wee
see some fall into such
despaire, as they cast
away themselues. In
short, the recompence
that couetise yeeldes
those that haue serued it
all their life, is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
like that of the
Diuell: whereof the end
is, that after a small
time hauing gratified
his Disciples, eyther
gee giues them ouer to
a hangman, or him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
breaks their necks.
I wil not here discourse
<pb facs="tcp:13715:18"/>
of the wickednesse and
mischiefes whereunto
the couetous men sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect
themselues, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
to these goodes,
whereby their consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
is filled with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
remorse, which
neuer leaues the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et:
sufficeth that in this
ouer-veheme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t exercise,
which busieth and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the greatest part of
the world, the body is
slain, the mind is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
the soule is lost
without any pleasure or
contentment.</p>
            <p>Come we to ambition,
which (by a greedinesse
<pb facs="tcp:13715:18"/>
of honour) fondly hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
occupied the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
persons: Think we
there to finde more?
nay rather, lesse. As the
one deceiueth vs, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
vs for al our trauel,
but a vile excrement of
the earth: so the other
repayes vs, but with
smoke and winde; the
rewardes of this being
as vaine, as those of that
were grosse. Both in the
one and the other, wee
fall into a bottomelesse
pit: but into this the fall
by so much the more
dangerous, as at the first
shew, the water is more
<pb facs="tcp:13715:19"/>
pleasant and cleare. Of
those that giue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to court ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
some are greate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
Princes, others
commaunders of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
both sortes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their degree
you see saluted, reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renced,
and adored of
those that are vnder
them. You see them
apparelled in purple,
in scarlet, and in cloth
of golde: it seemes,
at first sight, there is no
contentment in the
world but theirs. But
men knowe not, how
heauie an ounce of that
<pb facs="tcp:13715:19"/>
vaine honour weighes,
what those reuerences
cost them, and how
dearely they paye for
an ell of those rich stufs:
who knewe them well,
would neuer buy them
at the price. The one
hath attained to this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
after a long and
painefull seruice, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding
his life vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
occasion, with
losse oft times of a leg
or an arme, and that at
the pleasure of a Prince,
that more regards a hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
perches of ground
on his neighbors fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers,
then the liues of
<pb facs="tcp:13715:20"/>
a hundred thousand
such as hee: vnfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate,
to serue who loues
him not: and foolish,
to thinke himself in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
with him, that
makes so litle reckening
to lose him for a thing
of no worth. Others
growe vp by flattering
a Prince, and long sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
their tongues
&amp; hands to say and do
without differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer
they will haue
them: whereunto a
good minde can neuer
command it selfe. They
shall haue indured a
thousand iniuries, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
<pb facs="tcp:13715:20"/>
a thousand dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces;
and as neere
as they seem about the
Prince, they are neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
alwayes as the
Lyons keeper, who by
long patience, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand
feedinges, and a
thousand clawings, hath
made a fierce Lyon fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar;
yet giues him
neuer meate, but with
pulling backe his hand,
alwaies in feare least he
should catch him: and
if once in a yeare hee
bites him, hee sets it so
close, that he is paied for
a long time after. Such
is the ende of all Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:13715:21"/>
fauourites. When a
Prince after song brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
hath raised a ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to
greate height, hee
makes it his pastime, at
what time he seemes to
be at the top of his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell,
to cast him downe
at an instant: when hee
hath filled him with all
wealth, hee wrings him
after as a sponge; louing
none but himselfe, and
thinking euerie one
made, but to serue, and
please him. These blind
Courtiers make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
belieue, that they
haue friendes, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
that honour them:

co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly friendship co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists,

<pb facs="tcp:13715:22"/>
grieued either

what greater hel is ther,
what greater torment,
than enuie? which in
truth is nought else but
a feauer <hi>Hectique</hi> of the
minde: so they are vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
frustrate of all
friendship, euer iudged
by the wisest the chiefe
&amp; soueraigne good a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men. Will you
see it more clearely?
Let but Fortune turne
her backe, euerie man
turns from them: let hir
frowne, euerie man
lookes aside on them:
<pb facs="tcp:13715:22"/>
let them once be disroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
of their triumphall
garment, no bodie will
any more know them.
Againe, let there be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parelled
in it the most
vnworthie, and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
whatsoeuer: euen
he without difficulty, by
vertue of his robe, shall
inherit all the honours
the other had don him.
In the meane time they
are puffed vp, and grow
proude, as the Asse
which caried the image
of <hi>Isis</hi> was for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
done to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse,
&amp; regard not that
it is the fortune they
<pb facs="tcp:13715:23"/>
carrie which is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
not themselues, on
whom as on Asses, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times she wilbe cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But you will say: At
least so long as that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
endured, they were
at ease, &amp; had their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment;
&amp; who hath
3. or 4. or more yeares
of happie time, hath
not bin al his life vnhap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pie.
True, if this bee to
be at ease, continually
to feare to bee caste
down from that degree,
whereunto they are rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed:
and dayly to desire
with great trauell to
clime yet higher. Those
<pb facs="tcp:13715:23"/>
(my friend) whom thou
takest so well at their
ease, because thou seest
them but without, are
within farre otherwise.
They are faire built pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
full within of deep
ditches, and dungeons:
full of darkenesse, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
and tormentes.
Thou supposest them
lodged at large, and
they thinke their lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gings
strait. Thou thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
them very high, &amp;
they thinke themselues
verie lowe. Now, as sick
is hee, and many times
more sicke, who thinks
himselfe so, then who
<pb facs="tcp:13715:24"/>
indeede is. Suppose
them to bee Kings: if
they thinke themselues
slaues, they are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:
for what are wee
but by opinion? You
see them well followed
and attended: and euen
those whom they haue
chosen for their guarde,
they distrust. Alone or
in companie euer they
are in feare. Alone they
looke behinde them: in
company they haue an
eye on euery side of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
They drinke in gold and
siluer; but in those, not in
earth or glasse, is poyson
prepared and d<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>unke.
<pb facs="tcp:13715:24"/>
They haue their beds
soft &amp; well made: when
they lay them to sleepe
you shall not heare a
mouse stir in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:
not so much as a fly
shal come neer their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Yet neuerthelesse,
where the countrey man
sleeps at the fal of a great
riuer, at the noyse of a
market, hauing no other
bed but the earth, nor
couering but the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s,
these in the middest
of this silence and
delicacie, doe nothing
but turn fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> side to side,
it seemes still that they
heare some bodie, their
<pb facs="tcp:13715:25"/>
rest it selfe is without
rest Lastly, wil you know
what the diuersitie is be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tweene
the most hardly
intreated prisoners and
them both are enchai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
both loaden with
letters, but that the one
hath them of iron, the
other of gold; and that
the one is tied but by the
body, the other by the
minde. The prisoner
drawes his fetters after
him, the courtier wears
his vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him. The priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
minde sometimes
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>forts the paine of his
body, and sings in the
midst of his miseries: the
<pb facs="tcp:13715:25"/>
Courtier tormented in
mind, wearieth incessa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
his body, &amp; can neuer
giue it rest. And as for
the contentment you i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine
they haue, you
are there in yet more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued.
You iudge and
esteeme them greate,
because they are raised
high: but as fondly, as
who shuld iudge a dwarf
great, for being set on
a Tower, or on the
toppe of a mountaine.
You measure (so good
a Geometrician you
are) the image with
his base, which were
conuenient (to knowe
<pb facs="tcp:13715:26"/>
his true height) to bee
measur'd by it self: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
you regarde not the
height of the image, but
the height of the place
it standes vppon. You
deeme them great (if in
this earth there can bee
greatnesse, which in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
of the whole hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens
is but a point): But
coulde you enter into
their minds, you would
iudge, that neither they
are greate; true great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
consisting in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of those vaine
greatnesses, whereunto
they are slaues: nor seem
vnto themselues so, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:13715:26"/>
dayly they are aspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
higher, and neuer
where they would bee.
Some one sets downe a
bou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in his mind; Could
I attain to such a degree,
lo, I were content: I
would then rest my selfe.
Hath hee attained it?
hee giues himselfe not
so much as a breathing:
hee would yet ascende
higher. That which
is beneath, hee counts a
toy: it is in his opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
but one step. Hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
himselfe lowe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
there is some one
higher, in stead of repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
himselfe high, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb facs="tcp:13715:27"/>
ther be a millio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer:
&amp; so high he climes
at last, that either his
breath failes him by the
way, or he slides fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
top to the bottom. Or is
he get vp by al his trauel
it is but as to find himself
on the top of the Alpes,
not aboue the cloudes,
windes and stormes: but
rather at the deuotion
of lightnings and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pestes,
and whatsoeuer
else horrible, and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
is engendred, and
conceiued in the ayre:
which most commonly
taketh pleasure to thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolt
and dash into
<pb facs="tcp:13715:27"/>
powder that proude
height of theirs. It may
be herin you will agree
with mee, by reason of
the examples wherwith
both histories, &amp; mens
memories are ful. But say
you, such at least whom
nature hath sent into the
world with crownes on
their heads, and scepters
in their hands: such as
from their birth she hath
set in that height, as they
neede take no paine to
ascende: seeme without
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trouersie exempt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
all these iniuries, and by
consequence may call
themselues happie. It
<pb facs="tcp:13715:28"/>
may bee indeede they
feele lesse such incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities,
hauing been
borne, bred, and brought
vp among them: as one
borne neere the downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fals
of <hi>Nilus</hi> becomes
deafe to the founde: in
prison, laments not the
want of libertie: among
the <hi>Cimmerians</hi> in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall
night, wisheth
not for dave: on the
top of the Alpes, thinks
not strange of the mists,
the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pests, the snowes,
and the stormes. Yet
free doubtlesse they are
not, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the lightening
often blasteth a flowre
<pb facs="tcp:13715:28"/>
of their crownes, or
breakes their scepter in
their hands: when a drift
of snowe ouerwhelmes
them: whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a mist of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinesse,
and griefe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
blindeth their
wit and vnderstanding.
Crowned they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
but with a crowne
of thornes. They beare a
scepter: but it is of a reed
more then any thing in
the world pliable and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient
to all windes: it
being so far off that such
a crowne can cure the
maigrims of the mind, &amp;
such a scepter keepe off
and fray away the griefs
<pb facs="tcp:13715:29"/>
and cares which houer
about them; that it is
contrariwise the crown
that brings them, and
the scepter which from
al parts attracts them. O
crowne, said the Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Monarch, who knew
how heauie thou sittest
on the head, would not
vouchsafe to take thee
vp, though hee found
thee in his way. This
prince it seem'd gaue for
tune to the whole world,
distributed vnto men
haps and mishaps at his
pleasure could in show
make euery ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tent:
himselfe in the meane
<pb facs="tcp:13715:29"/>
while freely confessing,
that in the whole world,
which he held in his ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
there was nothing but
griefe, &amp; vnhappinesse
And what wil al the rest
tell vs, if they list to vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
what they fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d? We
will not aske them who
haue concluded a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
life with a dishono<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rable
death: who haue
beheld their kingdomes
buried before them, &amp;
haue in greate miserie
long ouerliued their
greatnesse. Not of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onyse</hi>
of <hi>Sicil,</hi> more con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tent
with a handfull of
twigs to whip litle chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb facs="tcp:13715:30"/>
of <hi>Corinth</hi> in a
choole, then with the
scepter, wherewith he
had beaten al <hi>Sicil:</hi> nor
of <hi>Sylla,</hi> who hauing rob<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bed
the whole State of
<hi>Rome,</hi> which had before
robbed the whole world,
neuer found meanes of
rest in himselfe, but by
robbing himselfe of his
owne estate, with incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
hazard both of his
power &amp; authority. But
demand we the opinion
of king <hi>Salomon,</hi> a man
indued withsingular gifts
of God, rich and weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of all thinges. who
sought for treasure from
<pb facs="tcp:13715:30"/>
the Iles: He will teach vs
by a booke of purpose,
that hauing tried all the
felicities of the earth, he
found nothing but vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
trauell, &amp; vexation of
spirit. Aske wee the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
<hi>Augustus,</hi> who
peaceably possessed the
whole world: Hee will
bewaile his life past, and
amonge infinite toyles
wish for the rest of the
meanest ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the earth:
accountinge that daye
most happie, when he
might vnload himself of
this insupportable great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes,
to liue quietly amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
he least. Of <hi>Tiberius</hi> his
<pb facs="tcp:13715:31"/>
successor, he wil co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fesse
vnto vs that hee holds y<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Empire as a wolf by the
eares, and that (if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
danger of biting he
might) he would gladly
let it goe, complayning
on Fortune for lifting
him so high, &amp; then ta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>king
away the ladder,
that he could not come
down again. Of <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sian,</hi>
a Prince of so great
wisdome and vertue in
y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> opinion of the world:
he wil prefer his volun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tarie
banishme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t at <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi>
before al the Roman
Empire. Finally, the
Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:13715:31"/>
fift, esteemed by our
Age most happie that
hath liued these many
ages: hee will curse his
conquests, his victories,
his triumphes: and not
be ashamed to confesse
that farre more good in
comparison he hath felt
in one day of his Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish
solitariness, then in
all his triumphant life.
Now, shall wee thinke
those happy in this ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginate
greatnesse, who
themselues think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
vnhappy? seeking
their happinesse in lesse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
themselues, &amp; not
finding in the world one
<pb facs="tcp:13715:32"/>
place to rest this great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
or one bed quietly
to sleep in? Happie is he
onely who in mind liues
contented: and hee most
of all vnhappie, whome
nothing he can haue can
content. Then miserable
<hi>Pyrrhus</hi> king of <hi>Albany,</hi>
who would winne al the
world, to win (as he said)
rest and went so farre to
seeke that which was so
neere him. But more
miserable, <hi>Alexander,</hi>
that being borne King
of a great Realme, and
Conqueror almost of
the earth, sought for
more worldes to satisfie
<pb facs="tcp:13715:32"/>
his foolish ambitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, with
in three daies content
with sixe foot of grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d.
To conclude, are they
borne on the highest
Alpes? they seeke to
scale heauen. Haue they
subdued al the Kinges of
the earth? they haue
quarelles to plead with
God, and indeuour to
treade vnder foote his
kingdome. They haue
no ende nor limite, till
God laughing at their
vaine purposes, when
they thinke themselues
at the last step, thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striketh
al this presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
breaking in shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
<pb facs="tcp:13715:33"/>
their scepters in
their handes, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
intrapping them
in their owne crownes.
At a word, whatsoeuer
happines can be in that
ambition promiseth, is
but suffering much il, to
get ill. Men thinke by
dayly climing higher to
pluck themselues out of
this ill: and the height
wherunto they so pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
aspire, is the height
of misery it self. I speak
not here of the wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chednes
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who all
their life haue held out
their cap to receiue the
almes of Court fortune,
<pb facs="tcp:13715:33"/>
and can get nothing, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
with incredible hart
griefe, seeing some by
lesse pains take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> haue ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
fal into their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds:
of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who iustling one
another to haue it, lose
it, and cast it into the
handes of a third: Of
those, who holding it in
their hands to hold it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,
haue lost it through
their fingers. Such by all
men are esteemed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie,
&amp; are indeed so,
because they iudge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
so. It sufficeth that
al these liberalities, which
the Deuill casteth vs as
out at a window, are but
<pb facs="tcp:13715:34"/>
baits: all these pleasures
but ambushes: and that
hee doth but make his
sport of vs, who striue
one with another for
such things, as most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
is hee, that hath
best hap to finde them.
Well now, you will say,
the Couetous in all his
goods, hath no good:
the Ambitious, at the
best hee can bee, is but
ill. But may there not
be some, who supplying
the place of Iustice, or
being neere about a
Prince, may without fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
such vnbridled
passions, pleasantly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioye
<pb facs="tcp:13715:34"/>
their goods, ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
honour with rest
and contentment of
minde? Surely, in former
ages (ther yet remaining
among men some sparks
of sinceritie) in some
sort it might bee so:
but being of that com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>position
they now are, I
see not how it may be in
any sort. For, deale you
in affaires of estate in
these times, either you
shal do wel, or you shall
do il. I fil, you haue God
for your enemy, &amp; your
owne conscience for a
perpetually tormenting
executioner. If well, you
<pb facs="tcp:13715:35"/>
haue men for your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
and of men the
greatest: whose enuy &amp;
malice wil spie you out,
&amp; whose cruelty &amp; tyra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
will euermore threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
you. Please the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
you please a beast:
&amp; pleasing such, ought
to be displeasing to your
selfe. Please your selfe,
you displease god: please
him, you incur a thousa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d
dangers in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, with
purchase of a thousand
displeasures. Wherof it
grows, that if you could
hear the talke of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sest
and least discontent
of this kinde of men,
<pb facs="tcp:13715:35"/>
whether they speake ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly,
or their wordes
passe them by force of
truth, one would gladly
cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge garment with his
tena<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: another preacheth
how goodly an estate it
is to haue nothing: a
third, complaining that
his braines are broken
with the noise of Court
or Palace, hath no other
thought, but as soone as
he may to retire himself
thence. So that you
shall not see any but is
displeased with his own
calling, &amp; enuieth that
of another: readie neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thelesse
to repent him, if
<pb facs="tcp:13715:36"/>
a man should take him
at his word. None but is
wearie of the businesses
wherunto his age is sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect,
&amp; wisheth not to be
elder, to free himselfe of
them: albeit otherwise
he keepeth off old age, as
much as in him lyeth.</p>
            <p>What must wee then
do in so great a contrari<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ety
&amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fusio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of minds?
Must we, to find true hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manitie,
flie the societie
of men, &amp; hide vs in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests
among wild beasts?
to auoyde these vnruly
passions, eschue the asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bly
of creatures suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
reasonable? to plucke
<pb facs="tcp:13715:36"/>
vs out of the euils of the
worlde, sequester our
selues from the world?
Could wee in so doing
liue at rest, it were some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>But alas! men cannot
take heerein what part
they would: and euen
they which doe, finde
not there all the rest
they sought for. Some
would gladly do: but
shame of the world re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals
them. Fooles, to
bee ashamed of what
in their harts they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne:
&amp; more fooles,
to bee aduised by the
greatest enemie they
<pb facs="tcp:13715:37"/>
can or ought to haue.
Others are borne in
hand that they ought to
serue the publicke; not
marking, that who cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, serue onely them
selues: and that the
more part would not
much seek the publicke,
but that they found their
owne particular. Some
are told, that by their
good exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple they may
amend others: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider
not that a hundred
sound men, euen Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicians
themselues, may
sooner catch the plague
in an infected Towne,
then one bee healed:
<pb facs="tcp:13715:37"/>
that it is but to to tempt
God, to enter therein:
that against so contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
an ayre there is no
preseruatiue, but in get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
far from it. Finally,
that as little as the fresh
waters, falling into the
sea, canne take from it
his saltnesse: so little
canne one <hi>Lot</hi> or two,
or three, reforme a
Court of <hi>Sodome.</hi> And
as co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the wisest,
who (no lesse careful for
their soules, then bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies)
seek to bring them
into a sound and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
ayre, far from the
infection of wickednes:
<pb facs="tcp:13715:38"/>
and who ledde by the
hand of some Angell of
God, retire themselues
in season, as <hi>Lot</hi> into
some little village of
<hi>Segor,</hi> out of the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the worlde, into
some Countrey place
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the infected townes,
there quietly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the time in some
knowledge and serious
contemplatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: I willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
yeelde they are in a
place of lesse danger, yet
because they carrie the
da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger in themselues, not
absolutely exempt from
danger. They flie the
court; &amp; a court follows
<pb facs="tcp:13715:38"/>
them on all sides: they
endeuour to escape the
world; and the worlde
pursues them to death.
Hardly in this Worlde
can they finde a place
where the Worlde
findes them not: so gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
it seekes to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
them. And if
by some speciall grace
of God they seem for a
while free from these
dangers, they haue som
pouertie that troubles
them, some domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
debate that torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts
them, or some familiar
spirit that tempts them:
briefly, the world dayly
<pb facs="tcp:13715:39"/>
in some sort or other
makes it selfe felt of
them. But the worst is,
whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are out of these
externall warres and
troubles, we finde great
ciuill warre within our
selues; the flesh against
the spirit, passion against
reason, earth against
heauen, the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
vs fighting for the
world, euermore so lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in the bottome of
our owne hearts, that on
no side we can flie from
it. I will say more: hee
makes profession to flie
the world, who seekes
thereby the prayse of
<pb facs="tcp:13715:39"/>
the world: hee faineth to
run away, who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the prouerbe; by
drawing back sets him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
forwarde. hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth
honours, that
would thereby be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to take them: and
hides him from men, to
the end they should com
to seeke him. So the
world often harbours in
disguised attire among
them that fly the world.
This is an abuse. But fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
we the company of
men, the world hath his
Court among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: seek
wee the Deserts, it hath
there his dens &amp; places
<pb facs="tcp:13715:40"/>
of resort, and in the
Desert it selfe tempteth
Christ lesus. Retire we
our selues into our selues,
wee finde it there as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean
as any where. We
cannot make the world
dye in vs, but by dying
our selues. Wee are in
the world, and the world
in vs, and to separate vs
from the world, we must
separate vs from our
selues. Now this separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is called Death. We
are, we think, come out
of the contagious City<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
but wee are not aduised
that we haue sucked the
bad ayre, that we carrie
<pb facs="tcp:13715:40"/>
the plague with vs, that
we so participate with it,
that through rockes,
through deserts, through
mountaines, it euer ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companieth
vs. Hauing
auoyded the contagion
of others, yet we haue it
in our selues. We haue
withdrawen vs out of
men, but not withdrawn
man out of vs. The te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stuous
sea torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts vs: we
are grieued at the heart,
&amp; desirous to vomit: and
to be discharged therof,
we remoue out of one
ship into another, from
a greater to a lesse: wee
promise our selues rest
<pb facs="tcp:13715:41"/>
in vaine: they being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
the same windes
that blowe, the same
waues that swell, the
same humors that are
stirred. To all, no other
port, no other meane
of tra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>quillitie but onely
death. We were sicke in
a cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber neer the street,
or neere the market: wee
caused our selues to bee
carried into some bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker
closet, where the
noise was not so great.
But though there the
noyse was lesse: yet was
the feauer there neuer
the lesse: and therby lost
nothing of his heate.
<pb facs="tcp:13715:41"/>
Change bed, chamber,
house, countrey, againe
and again: we shal euery
where find the same vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,
because euery where
we finde our selues: and
seeke not so much to be
others, as to bee other
wheres. Wee follow so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarinesse,
to fly careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
We retire vs (so
say wee) from the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked:
but cary with vs our
auarice, our ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
our riotousnesse, all
our corrupt affections:
which breed in vs 1000.
remorses<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; 1000. times
each day bring to our re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>membrance
the garlike
<pb facs="tcp:13715:42"/>
&amp; onions of <hi>Egypt.</hi> Dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
they passe the Ferrie
with vs: so that both on
this side, and beyond the
water, we are in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
combat. Now could
we cassere this company
which eates and gnawes
our mind, doubtlesse we
should be at rest, not in
solitarinesse onely, but
euen in the thicket of
men. For the life of
man vppon earth is
but a continuall warre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.
Are wee deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
from externall pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices?
wee are to take
heede of internall espi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alles.
Are the Greekes
<pb facs="tcp:13715:42"/>
gone away? wee haue a
<hi>Sinon</hi> within, that wil be
tray them the place. We
must euer be waking, ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uing
an eie to the watch,
and weapons in our
hands, if wee will not
euerie houre be surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
and giuen vp to the
wil of our enemies. And
how at last can wee es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape?
Not by the woods,
by the riuers, nor moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains:
not by throwing
our selues into a presse,
nor by thrusting our
selues into a hole. One
onely meane there is,
which is death: which in
the ende separating our
<pb facs="tcp:13715:43"/>
spirit fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our flesh, the
pure and cleane part of
our soule from the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane,
which within vs
euermore bandeth it self
for the world, appeaseth
by this separation that,
which conioyned in one
&amp; the same person could
not, without vtter choa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of the spirit, but be
in perpetuall conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>And as touching the
contentment that may
be in the exercises of the
wisest men in their soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarines,
as reading diuine
or prosane books, with
all other knowledges
<pb facs="tcp:13715:43"/>
and learnings: I holde
well that it is indeede a
farre other thing, then
are those mad huntings,
which make sauage a
multitude of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> posse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssed
with these or the like
diseases of the mind. Yet
must they all abide the
iudgement pronounced
by the wisest among the
wise, <hi>Salomon,</hi> that al this
neuerthelesse applied to
mans naturall dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is to him but vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
and vexation of
minde. Some are euer
learning to correct their
speech, and neuer think
of correcting their life.
<pb facs="tcp:13715:44"/>
Others dispure in their
Logique of reason, and
the Arte of reason: and
lose therby many times
their naturall reason.
One learnes by Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticke
to diuide, to the
smallest fractions, and
hath not skil to part one
shilling with his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Another by Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrie
canne measure
fieldes, and townes, and
Countreyes: but cannot
measure himselfe. The
Musician can accord his
voices, and soundes, and
times together: hauing
nothing in his heart but
discords, nor one passion
<pb facs="tcp:13715:44"/>
in his soule in good tune.
The Astrologer lookes
vp on highe, and falles
in the next ditch: fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowes
the future, and
sorgoes the prese<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: hath
often his eye on the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens;
his heart long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
buried in the earth.
The Philosopher discour<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>seth
of the nature of all
other things: &amp; knowes
not himselfe. The His<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian
canne tell of the
warres of <hi>Thebes</hi> and of
<hi>Troy:</hi> but what is done
in his owne house can
tell nothing. The Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer
will make lawes for
all the worlde, and not

one from himselfe. The
Physician will cure o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
and be blind in his
owne disease: finde the
least alteration in his
pulse, and not marke the
burning feauers of his
minde. Lastly, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine
wil spend the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
part of his time in
disputing of faith, and
cares not to hear of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
wil talke of God, &amp;
not regarde to succour
men. These knowledges
bring on the minde an
endlesse labour, but no
contentment: for the
more one knowes, the
more he would know.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13715:45"/>They pacifie not the
debates a man feeles in
himselfe, they cure not
the diseases of his mind.
They make him learned
but they make not him
good: cunning but not
wise. I say more: The
more a man knowes, the
more knowes he that he
knowes not: the fuller
the mind is, the emptier
it findes it selfe: foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as whatsoeuer a
man can know of anie
science in this world, is
but the least part of
what he is ignorant: all
his knowledge co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sisting
in knowing his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb facs="tcp:13715:46"/>
all his perfection
in noting his imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
which who best
knowes and notes, is in
truth among men the
most wise and perfect. In
short, we must conclude
with <hi>Salomon,</hi> that the
beginning and ende of
wisedome is the feare of
God: that this wisedome
neuerthelesse is taken of
the world for meere fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie,
and persecuted by
the world as a deadly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie:
and that as who
feareth God, ought to
feare no euil, for that all
his euils are conuerted to
his good: so neither
<pb facs="tcp:13715:46"/>
ought hee to hope for
good in the world, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
there the diuell his
professed enemy, whom
the Scripture tearmeth
Prince of the world.</p>
            <p>But with what exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
soeuer wee passe
the time, behold old age
vnwares to vs comes vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
vs: which whether
we thrust our selues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the prease of men, or
hide vs some where out
of the way, neuer failes
to finde vs out. Euerie
man makes account in
that age to rest himselfe
of all his trauailes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
further care, but to
<pb facs="tcp:13715:47"/>
keep himself at ease &amp; in
health. And see contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
in this age, there is
nothing but an after tast
of al the foregoing euils:
and most commonly a
plentifull haruest of all
such vices, as in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> whole
course of their life hath
held &amp; possessed them.
There you haue the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habilitie
and weakenesse
of infancy, and (which
is worse) many times
accompanied with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie:
there you are
payed for the excesse
&amp; riotousnes of youth,
with gowtes, palsies,
and such like diseases,
<pb facs="tcp:13715:47"/>
which take from you
limme after limme, with
extreame paine and
torment. There also
you are recompenced
for the trauels of mind,
the watchings &amp; cares
of manhoode, with
losse of sight, losse of
hearing, and all the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
one after another,
except only the sense of
paine. Not one parte
in vs but death takes in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gage
to be assured of vs,
as of bad pay masters,
which infinitely feare
their dayes of payment.
Nothing in vs that will
not by and by bee dead:
<pb facs="tcp:13715:48"/>
&amp; neuerthelesse our vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
yet liue in vs; &amp; not
onely liue, but in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite
of Nature dayly
growe young againe.
The couetous man hath
one foote in his graue,
and is yet burying his
money: meaning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
to finde it againe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
day. The ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
in his Will ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
vnprofitable po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ps
for his funerals, making
his vice to liue and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphe
after his death.
The riotous, no longer
able to daunce on his
feete, daunceth with his
shoulders: all vi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

left him, and hee
not yet able to leaue
them. The childe wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sheth
for youth and this
man laments it. The
young man liueth in
hope of the future: and
this feeles the euill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
lamentes the false
pleasures past, and sees
for the time to come
nothing to hope for;
More foolish then the
child, in bewailing the
time hee cannot recall,
&amp; not remembring the
euill he had therein: and
more wretched then the
young man, in that after
a wretched life not able
<pb facs="tcp:13715:49"/>
but wretchedly to d<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
matter of despaire. As
for him, who from his
youth hath vndertaken
to combate against the
fleshe, and against the
World: who hath taken
so great paines to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
himselfe and leaue
the World before his
time: who besides those
ordinary euilles findes
himself vexed with this
great and incurable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease
of olde age, and
feeles notwithstanding
his fleshe, how weake
soeuer, stronger of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
then his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:
<pb facs="tcp:13715:49"/>
what good I pray
can hee haue but onely
herein; that hee sees his
death at hand, that hee
sees his combate fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
that hee sees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
readie to depart by
death out of this loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
prison, wherein
all his life time hee hath
beene racked and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented?
I will not here
speak of the infinit euils
wherewith men in all
ages are annoyed, as
losse of friends and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
banishments, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iles,
disgraces, and such
others, common and
ordinarie in the world:

one making sorrow for

world is so full of euills,
that to write of all, wold
require another world

<pb facs="tcp:13715:50"/>
who had hee beene set

woulde giue it ouer to
him that came next:
yea, sooner then hee,
who shall consider, in
all the goods that euer
he hath had, the euils he
hath endured to get the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
and hauing them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
and keepe them (I
speake of the pleasures
that may bee kept, and
not of those that wi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther
in a moment) will
iudge of himselfe, and
by himselfe, that the
keeping it selfe of the
greatest felicitie in this
world, is full of vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse
<pb facs="tcp:13715:51"/>
and infelicitie.
Conclude then, that
Childe-hood is but a
foolish simplicity; youth
a vaine heate; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
a painefull care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse;
and olde age, a
noisome languishing:
that our playes are but
tears, our pleasures fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
of the minde, our
goods, rackes, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
our honours
heauie vanities, our rest,
vnreste: that passing
from age to age, is but
passing from euill to
euill, and from the lesse
vnto the greater: &amp; that
alwayes it is but one
<pb facs="tcp:13715:51"/>
waue driuing on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
vntill we be arriued
at the hauen of death.
Conclude I say, that life
is but a wishing for the
future, and a bewailing
of the past: a loathing
of what we haue tasted,
and a longing for that
wee haue not tasted: a
vaine memorie of the
state past, and a doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
expectation of the
state to come: Finally,
that in all our life there
is nothing certaine, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
assured, but the
certaintie &amp; vncertainty
of death. Behold, now
comes death vnto vs:
<pb facs="tcp:13715:52"/>
Behold hir, whose ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proache
wee so much
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eare. Wee are now to
consider whether shee
be such as we are made
belieue: and whether
wee ought so greatly to
flie hir, as commonly
we doe. We are afraid
of her: but like little
children, of a vizor, or
of the Images of <hi>Hecate.</hi>
We haue hir in horror;
but because we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceiue
her not such as shee is,
but ougly, terrible, and
hideous: such as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
the Painters to
represent vnto vs on a
wall. Wee flie before
<pb facs="tcp:13715:52"/>
hir: but it is, because
(foretaken with such
vaine imaginations) we
giue not our selues lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to marke hir. But
stay wee, stand we sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast,
looke we hir in the
face<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wee shall finde hir
quite other then shee is
painted vs, and altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of other counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce
then our mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
life. Death makes
an end of this life. This
life is a perpetuall mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
and tempest: Death
then is the issue of our
miseries and entraunce
of the port where wee
shall ride in safetie from
<pb facs="tcp:13715:53"/>
all windes. And should
wee feare that which
withdraweth vs from
misery, or which drawes
vs into our hauen? Yea
but you will say, it is a
paine to dye. Admit it
bee: so is there in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of a wound: Such
is the Worlde, that
one euill cannot bee
cured but by another;
to heale a contusion,
must bee made an incisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
You will say, there
is difficultie in the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage:
So is there no ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
no port, wherein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the entraunce is not
straite and combersom.
<pb facs="tcp:13715:53"/>
No good thing is to bee
bought in this World
with other the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the coyne
of labour &amp; paine. The
entrance indeed is hard,
if our selues make it
hard, comming thither
with a tormented spirit,
a troubled minde, a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering
and irresolute
thought. But bring we
quietnes of minde, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancie,
and full resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wee shall not finde
any danger or difficultie
at all. Yet what is the
paine that death brings
vs? Nay, what can shee
do with those paines we
feele? Wee accuse hir
<pb facs="tcp:13715:54"/>
of all the euils we abide
in ending our life, and
consider not how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
more woundes or
grieuous sickenesses we
haue endured without
death: or how many
more vehement paines
we haue suffered in this
life, in the which wee
called euen hir to our
succour. All the paines
our life yeeldes vs, at
the last houre wee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
to death: not
marking, that life begun
and continued in al sorts
of paine, must also nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssarily
ende in paine.
Not marking (I say) that
<pb facs="tcp:13715:54"/>
it is the remainder of
our life, not death that
tormenteth vs: the end
of our nauigation that
paines vs, not the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
wee are to enter:
which is nothing else
but a safegarde against
all windes. We com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine
of death, where
wee should complaine
of life: as if one hauing
beene long sicke, and
beginning to bee well,
should accuse his health
of his last paines, and
not the reliques of his
disease. Tell me, what
is it else to bee deade,
but to bee no more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb facs="tcp:13715:55"/>
in the world? Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
and simplie not
to bee in the World,
is it any paine? Did
wee then feele anie
paine, when as yet
wee were not? Haue
wee euer more resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of Death, then
when wee sleepe? Or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
more rest, then at
that time? Now if this
be no paine, why accuse
wee death of the paines
our life giues vs at our
departure? vnlesse also
wee will fondly accuse
the time when as yet we
were not, of the paines
wee felt at our birth. If
<pb facs="tcp:13715:55"/>
the comming in be with
teares, is it wonder that
such bee the going out?
If the beginning of our
being, bee the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of our paine, is it
maruell that such be the
ending? But if our not
being in times past hath
beene without paine, &amp;
all this being contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
full of paine: whom
should we by reason ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
of the last paines?
the not being to come,
or the remnant of this
present beeing? Wee
thinke we dye not, but
when we yeelde vp our
last gaspe. But if wee
<pb facs="tcp:13715:56"/>
mark well, wee dye eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
daie, euerie houre,
euery moment. Wee
apprehende death as a
thing vnusual to vs: and
yet haue nothing so co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
in vs. Our liuing
is but continuall dying:
looke how much wee
liue, we dye how much
we increase, our life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creases.
We enter not
a step into life, but wee
enter a step into death.
Who hath liued a third
part of his yeares, hath
a third part of himselfe
dead: VVho halfe his
yeares, is already halfe
dead. Of our life, all
<pb facs="tcp:13715:56"/>
the time past is dead, the
present liues and dyes
at once, and the future
likewise shall dye. The
past is no more, the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is not yet, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
is, and no more
is. Briefly, this whole
life is but a death: it is as
a candle lighted in our
bodies: in one the wind
makes it melte awaie,
in another blowes it
cleane out, many times
ere it bee halfe bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned:
in others it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth
to the ende.
Howesoeuer it bee,
looke howe much it
shineth, so much it
<pb facs="tcp:13715:57"/>
burneth: hir shining
is her burning: her
lighte is a vanishing
smoke: her last fire,
her last wike, and her
last droppe of moisture.
So is it in the life of man,
life and death in man is
all one. If wee call the
last breath death, so
must wee all the rest: all
proceeding from one
place, and all in one
manner. One onely
difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
this life, and that
we call death: that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the one, wee haue
alwaies whereof to die:
and after the other, ther
<pb facs="tcp:13715:57"/>
remaineth only where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
to liue. In summe, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
hee that thinketh
death simply to bee the
end of man, ought not
to feare it: in asmuch as
who desireth to liue
long, desireth to dye
longer: and who fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
soone to dye, fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
(to speake proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly)
least he may not lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
dye.</p>
            <p>But vnto vs, brought
vppe in a more holie
schoole, death is a far
other thing: neither
need we, as the Pagans,
of consolations against
death: but that death
<pb facs="tcp:13715:58"/>
serue vs as a consolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
against all sorts of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction:
so that we must
not onely strengthen
our selues, as they, not
to feare it, but accustom
our selues to hope for it.
For vnto vs it is not a
departing from paine
and euill, but an accesse
vnto all good: not the
ende of life, but the ende
of death, and the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of life. Better,
saith <hi>Salomon,</hi> is the day
of death, then the day of
birth: and why? because
it is not to vs a last day,
but the dawning of an
euerlasting day. No
<pb facs="tcp:13715:58"/>
more shall wee haue,
in that glorious light,
either sorrowe for the
past, or expectation of
the future: for al shal be
there present vnto vs, &amp;
that present shall neuer
more passe. No more
shall wee powre out our
selues in vaine and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
pleasures: for wee
shal bee filled with true,
and substantiall plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.
No more shall we
paine our selues in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
togither these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s
of the earth; for
the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s shall be ours:
and this masse of earth,
which euer drawes vs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes
<pb facs="tcp:13715:59"/>
the earth, shall
bee buried in the earth.
No more shall we ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearie
our selues with
mounting from degree
to degree, and from ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
to honour: for wee
shall highly bee raised a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
all heights of the
world; and, from on
high, laugh at the folly
of all those wee once
admired, who fight to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
for a point, &amp; as
little children for lesse
then an apple. No more
(to be briefe) shall we
haue co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bats in our selues:
for our flesh shal be dead,
and our spirit in full life:
<pb facs="tcp:13715:59"/>
our passion buried,
and our reason in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
libertie. Our soule,
deliuered out of this
foule and filthie prison,
(where, by long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing,
it is growen
into an habite of croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse)
shall againe
drawe her owne breath,
recognize her aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
dwelling, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
remember her
former glory and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
This flesh (my friend)
which thou feelest, this
body which thou tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chest,
is not man. Man is
from heauen: heauen
is his countrey and his
<pb facs="tcp:13715:60"/>
ayre. That hee is in his
body, is but by way of
exile and confinement.
Man indeede is soule &amp;
spirit: Man is rather of
celestial and diuine qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie,
wherein is nothing
grosse nor material. This
body, such as now it is, is
but the barke and shell
of the soule: which
must necessarily be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken,
if wee will be hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched:
if we will indeed
liue and see the light.
Wee haue, it seemes,
some life, &amp; some sense
in vs: but are so crooked
and contracted, that
wee cannot so much as
<pb facs="tcp:13715:60"/>
stretch out our wings,
much lesse take our
flight towardes hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
vntill wee bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burthened
of this earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
burthen. Wee looke,
but through false spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles:
wee haue eyes,
but ouer growen with
pearles: wee thinke we
see, but it is in a dreame,
wherein we see nothing
but deceit. All that wee
haue, and all that wee
knowe, is but abuse and
vanitie. Death onely can
restore vs both life and
light: and we thinke (so
blockish we are) that she
comes to rob vs of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:13715:61"/>We say we are Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians:
that we beleeue,
after this mortall, a life
immortall: that death is
but a separation of the
bodie and soule: and that
the soule returnes to her
happie abode, there to
ioy in God, who onely is
all good: that at the last
day it shall againe take
the body, which shall
no more bee subiect to
corruption. With these
goodly discourses wee
fill all our bookes: and in
the mean while, when it
comes to the point, the
verie name of death as
the horriblest thing
<pb facs="tcp:13715:61"/>
in the World makes vs
quake and tremble. If
we beleeue as we speak,
what is that wee feare?
to bee happie? to bee at
our ease? to bee more
content in a mome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
we might be in the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
mortall life that
might be? or must not we
of force confesse, that we
beleeue it but in part?
that all wee haue is but
wordes? that all our
discourses, as of these
hardy trencher-knights,
are but vaunting and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie?
Some you shall
see, that will say: I
knowe well that I
<pb facs="tcp:13715:62"/>
passe out of this life
into a better; I make
no doubte of it: one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
I feare the midway
step, that I am to step
ouer. Weake hearted
creatures! they will kill
themselues, to gette their
miserable liuing: suffer
infinite paines, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
woundes at another
mans pleasure: passe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
deathes without
dying, for things of
nought, for thinges that
perish, and perchance
make them perish with
them. But when they
haue but one pase to
passe to bee at rest,
<pb facs="tcp:13715:62"/>
not for a day, but for
euer; not an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
rest, but such as
mans minde cannot
comprehend: they trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
their harts fail them,
they are affraide: and yet
the grounde of their
harme is nothing but
feare. Let them neuer
tell mee, they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the paine: it is but
an abuse; a purpose to
conceale the little faith
they haue.</p>
            <p>No, no, they would
rather languish of the
gowte, the sciatica, anie
disease whatsoeuer: then
dy one sweet death with
<pb facs="tcp:13715:63"/>
the least paine possible:
rather pyningly dye
limme after limme,
out-liuinge as it were,
all their senses, moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and actions, then
speedily dye, immediat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to liue for euer. Let
them tell mee no more
that they would in this
worlde learne to liue:
for euerie one is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
sufficiently instruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in himselfe, and not
one but is cunning in the
trade.</p>
            <p>Nay rather they should
learne in this Worlde to
dye; and once to dye wel,
dye dayly in themselues:
<pb facs="tcp:13715:63"/>
so prepared, as if the end
of euerie dayes worke,
were the ende of our
life. Now contrariwise
there is nothing to their
eares more offensiue
then to heare of death.
Senselesse people! wee
abandon our life to
the ordinarie hazardes
of warre, for seauen
frankes pay: are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
in an assault, for a
little bootie: goe into
places whence there is
no hope of returning,
with daunger manie
times both of bodies
and soules. But to
free vs from all hazards,
<pb facs="tcp:13715:64"/>
to winne thinges inesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable,
to enter an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
life, wee faint in the
passage of one pase,
wherein is no difficultie,
but in opinion: yea, wee
so faint, that were it not
of force wee must passe,
and that God in despite
of vs will doe vs a good
turne, hardly should
wee finde in all the
World one, how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happie
or wretched so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer,
that would euer
passe.</p>
            <p>Another will say,
had I liued till fiftie or
sixtie yeares, I should
haue beene contented, I
<pb facs="tcp:13715:64"/>
should not haue cared to
liue longer: but to dye
so young is no reason. I
should haue knowen the
world before I had left
it. Simple soule! in this
worlde there is neither
young nor old.</p>
            <p>The longest age in
comparison of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
is past, or all that is to
come, is nothing: and
when thou hast liued
to the age thou nowe
desirest, all the past will
bee nothing: thou wilt
still gape for that is to
come. The past will
yeelde thee but sorrow,
the future but expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:13715:65"/>
the present noe
contentment. As rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
thou wilt then be to
redemaund longer res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite,
as before. Thou
fliest thy creditour from
moneth to moneth,
and time to time, as
ready to pay the last
day, as the first: thou
seekest but to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted.</p>
            <p>Thou hast tasted all
which the worlde estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
pleasures: not
one of them is new vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
thee. By drinking of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tener,
thou shalt bee
neuer a white the more
satisfied: for the body
<pb facs="tcp:13715:65"/>
thou cariest, like the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
paile of <hi>Danaus</hi>
daughters, will neuer be
full. Thou mayst soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
weare it out, then
wearie thy selfe with
vsing or rather abusing
it.</p>
            <p>Thou crauest long life
to cast it away, to spende
it on worthlesse de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
to misspend it on
vanities. Thou art co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetous
in desiring, and
prodigall in spending<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
Say not thou findest fault
with the Court, or the
Palace: but that thou
desirest longer to serue
the Common wealth, to
<pb facs="tcp:13715:66"/>
serue thy Countrey, to
serue GOD. Hee
that set thee on worke
knowes vntill what day,
and what houre, thou
shouldest bee at it: hee
well knowes how to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
his worke. Should
hee leaue thee there
longer, perchance thou
wouldest marre all. But
if hee will pay thee libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
for thy labour,
as much for halfe a
dayes worke, as for
a whole: as much for
hauing wrought till
noone, as for hauing
borne all the heate of
the day: art thou not
<pb facs="tcp:13715:66"/>
so much the more to
thanke and prayse him?
but if thou examine
thine owne conscience,
thou lamentest not the
cause of the widow, and
the orphane, which
thou hast left depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
in iudgement: not
the dutie of a sonne, of
a father, or of a friend,
which thou pretendest
thou wouldest perform:
not the ambassage for
the Common wealth,
which thou wert euen
readie to vndertake: not
the seruice thou desirest
to doe vnto God, who
knowes much better
<pb facs="tcp:13715:67"/>
how to serue him-selfe
of thee, then thou of thy
selfe.</p>
            <p>It is thy houses and
gardens thou lamentest,
thy imperfect plots and
purposes, thy life (as
thou thinkest) imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte:
which by noe
dayes, nor yeares, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
might be perfected:
and yet thy selfe migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
perfecte in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
couldest thou
but thinke in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
that where it ende it
skils not, so that it ende
well.</p>
            <p>Now to ende wel this
life, is only to ende it
<pb facs="tcp:13715:67"/>
willingly: followinge
with full consent the
will and direction of
God, and not suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
vs to bee drawen
by the necessitie of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinie.</p>
            <p>To end it willingly, we
must hope, and not feare
death. To hope for it,
wee must certainely
looke, after this life, for
a better life. To looke
for that, wee must feare
God: whom whoso well
feareth, feareth indeede
nothing in this world,
and hopes for all things
in the other. To one
well resolued in these
<pb facs="tcp:13715:68"/>
points, death canne be
but sweete and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able:
knowing, that
through it hee is to
enter into a place of all
ioyes,</p>
            <p>The griefe that may
bee therein shall bee
allaied with sweetnesse:
the sufferaunce of ill,
swallowed in the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of good: the
sting of Death it selfe
shall bee dead, which
is nothinge else but
Feare. Nay, I will say
more, not onely all the
euilles conceiued in
death shall bee to him
nothing: but hee shall
<pb facs="tcp:13715:68"/>
euen scorne alll the
mishappes men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt
in this life, and
laugh at all these ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours.</p>
            <p>For I pray what can
he feare, whose death is
his hope? Thinke wee to
banish him his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey?
Hee knowes hee hath a
Countrey otherwhere,
whence wee cannot ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
him: and that all
these countreyes are but
Innes, out of which hee
must part at the will of
his host.</p>
            <p>To put him in prison?
a more straite prison he
cannot haue, then his
<pb facs="tcp:13715:69"/>
owne bodie, more fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie,
more darke, more
full of rackes and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>To kill him and take
him out of the world?
thats it he hopes for: that
is it with all his heart hee
aspires vnto. By fire, by
sworde, by famine, by
sickenesse? within three
yeares, within three
dayes, within three
houres, all is one to him:
all is one at what gate,
or at what time he passe
out of this miserable
life. For his businesses
are euer ended, his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires
all dispatched;
<pb facs="tcp:13715:69"/>
and by what way he shal
go out, by the same hee
shall enter into a most
happie and euerlasting
life.</p>
            <p>Men canne threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
him but death, and
death is all hee promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
himselfe: the worst
they canne doe, is, to
make him dye, and that
is the best hee hopes for.
The threatninges of
tyrants are to him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises,
the swordes
of his greatest enemies
drawen in his fauour:
for as much as hee
knowes that threatning
him death, they threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb facs="tcp:13715:70"/>
him life: and the
most mortall woundes
can make him but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall:
Who feares
God, feares not death:
and who feares it not,
feares not the worst of
this life.</p>
            <p>By this reckening,
you will tell me, death
is a thing to bee wished
for: and to passe from
so much euil, to so much
good, a man should (it
seemeth) cast away his
life. Surely, I feare not,
that for any good wee
expect, wee will hasten
one steppe the faster:
though the spirit aspire,
<pb facs="tcp:13715:70"/>
the body (it drawes with
it) withdrawes it euer
sufficiently towards the
earth. Yet is it not
that I conclude. Wee
must seeke to mortifie
our flesh in vs, and to
cast the World out of
vs: but to caste our
selues out of the world
is in no sort permitted
vs. The Christian ought
willingly to depart out
of this life, but not co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly
to runne away.
The Christian is ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by GOD to fight
therein: and cannot
leaue his place without
incurring reproach and
<pb facs="tcp:13715:71"/>
infamie. But if it please
the graund Captaine to
recall him, let him take
the retrait in good part,
and with good will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey
it. For hee is not
borne for himselfe, but
for God: of whom hee
holdes his life at farme,
as his tenant at will, to
yeelde him the profites.
It is in the Land-lord to
take it from him, not
in him to surrender it,
when a conceite takes
him. Diest thou young?
prayse God, as the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
that hath had a
good winde, soone to
bring him to the Port.
<pb facs="tcp:13715:71"/>
Dyest thou Olde?
prayse him likewise: for
if thou hast had lesse
winde, it may be thou
hast also had lesse waues.
But thinke not at thy
pleasure to go faster or
softer: for the winde is
not in thy power; and
in steade of taking the
shortest way to the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,
thou maiest hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely
suffer shipwracke.
God calleth home fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
his worke, one in the
morning, another at
noone, and another at
night. One hee exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciseth
till the first sweat,
another hee sunne-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth,
<pb facs="tcp:13715:72"/>
another hee roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth
&amp; drieth through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
But of all his hee
leaues all to rest, and
giues them al their hire,
euerie one in his time.
Who leaues his worke
before God call him,
loseth it: and who
importunes him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the time, loseth
his reward. Wee must
rest vs in his wil, who in
the middest of our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
sets vs at rest.</p>
            <p>To ende, wee ought
neither to hate this life
for the toyles therein;
for it is slouth and cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardise:
nor loue it for
<pb facs="tcp:13715:72"/>
the delights; which is
folly and vanitie: but
serue vs of it, to serue
God in it, who after it
shal place vs in true qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse,
and replenish
vs with pleasures which
shal neuer more perish.
Neither ought wee to
flie death; for it is chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish
to feare it: and
in flying from it, wee
meete it. Much lesse to
seeke it, for that is te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meritie:
nor euerie one
that would die, can die.
As much despaire in
the one, as cowardise in
the other: in neither any
kinde of magnanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
<pb facs="tcp:13715:73"/>
It is enough that we
constantly and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
waite for her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,
that she may nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
finde vs vnprouided.
For as there is nothing
more certaine then
death, so is ther nothing
more vncertain then the
houre of death, knowne
onely, o God, the onely
Author of life &amp; death,
to whom wee all ought
endeuour both to liue &amp;
die.</p>
