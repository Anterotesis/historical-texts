         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:913:7"/>
be moalded into such a fashion
as will be durable in after-ages.
The seedes espeicially, and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall
parts of vertue, are
by an early, and strong perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to bee soe engrafted into
them, that they need not know,
whither nature or praecept
were the teachers of them. To
be dutifull to their parents, and
obedient to their counsels; to
abhorre intemperance, lying,
and deceite, as prodigies and
things vnusuall; to adore espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
the power of God, and
sometimes by mercy, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
by iudgement, to consider
of it. These things must bee
taught them, without trouble
or seuerity; for what euer wee
follow for feare of punishment,
from the same things with a
sad loathing wee vse to bee
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:913:7"/>
auerse, and the hatred concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
in our youth, I know not
by what custome of horrour,
wee oft nourish in our old age.
The must daily bee seasoned
with instructions concerning
the excellency and rewards of
vert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>; and vices in a shamefull
and disdainefull manner, must be
named to them, to make them
altogether ignorant, that such
vices are now often in publike
practised, and without infamy.
Being thus brought vp in such
gentle rudiments, they will hate
vices, and learne not to feare
vertue as too rigid, and harsh a
mistresse. They will easily bee
brought to these beginnings of
right discipline, by the guidance
of their parents and teachers,
whose opinions, like diuine
Oracles, will altogether sway
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:913:8"/>
their minds yet weake, and not
troubled with the ambition
of iudging. Besides this, they
cannot be allured, by the fiatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
promises of any vice, whose
age as yet, is not onely vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
of pleasure, but vtterly
incapable of it: they will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
easily condemne that thing,
which in the iudgement of
their friends, is dishonest, and
commended to themselues, by
noe temptation. Nor, would we
here initiate their childhood in
any such torment, as supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
and anxious piety; but
manly, and wary vertue; for
since the mindes of men, by an
inbred waight, bend heauily
downward to the worst things;
wee had neede to bow them,
while yet they are tender, quite
contrary; that by this meanes
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:913:8"/>
when their naturall force shall
bring them backe, they may yet
retaine a happy meane betwixt
their nature, and education. But
in this discipline of tender
youth, as soone as their mindes
are sensible of praise, the desire
of it is to bee kindled in them,
that they may then learne, and
accustome themselues to affect
honour; and in all exercises, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in schooles, or abroad at
play, they may labour with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to excell their equals. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
when their age encreasing,
shall bring them by degrees as
it were, out of bondage, soe that
both the awe of their parents
may not too sensibly decrease in
them, and they not wanton it,
through a suddaine, and vnexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
encrease of liberty: we must
leaue their childhood to those
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:913:9"/>
delights which are proper to
that age, least we should seeme
to accuse nature, which hath
ordained that age to bee weake
and feeble; and vnseasonable
sowing of wisedome in them,
corrupt their natures, not yet
ripe for such instructions. Let
harmelesse wantonnesse be free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
allowed them; let them gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be taught learning, rather as
a change of recreation then a
loathsome burthen; and rather
feare, then feele, the correction
of their parents: let them lastly,

and doe exhibite to themselues,
and reuolue wisedome, in the
shape of an Hobgoblin, whose
sowre, and sharpe documents
they are not yet capable of.</p>
            <p>That sense of misery which
is most cruelly exquisite, is
most incident to that age:
whilst their tender mindes doe
want ability to gouerne their
feare, and iudge of miseries,
which yet they know not,
worse then they are. And as
men, whom fortune hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with great calamities, how
large so euer their capacities are,
will fill them all with the sense,
and contemplation of their
owne miseries: euen soe in chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
when that happens which
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:913:10"/>
they feare the worst, all their
ability of fearing, and grieuing
is spent vpon it. A man, which
by chance had escaped the
hands of theeues, who threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to hange him; being asked,
with what minde he expected
death; with the same (quoth
hee) that, when I was a boy, I
expected whipping. Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer,
the bitternesse of perpetuall
feare in childrens mindes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumeth
that moisture, which
nature intendeth to make abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant,
for the spreading of their
limmes, and growth of their
bodies. For the stomacke we see,
doth then want his naturall vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
when the heate, and spirits
are called from thence, to aide
the di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ressed braine; nor is the
blood strongly diffused vpon
promise of ioy, being too much
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:913:10"/>
consumed with the interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of sadnesse. Therefore such
dispositions in the bondage of
seuere custody, the abilities of
their mindes, either frighted, or
wasted, will stand at soe vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
a stay, that those, who were
wise aboue their Childhood, do
afterwards want the ordinary
wisedome required at Mans
estate. To Colts, and young Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
we freely allow an vncurbed
wantonnesse, least their first
strength, which is then grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
should bee hindered by a
fearefull apprehension of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
bondage; and are wee soe
blinded in minde, that what
wee behold in other creatures,
we eyther neglect, or will not
vnderstand in our owne chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?
Neither yet is this age of
Infancy to bee let loose to an
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:913:11"/>
in finite liberty; let them with
moderation bee kept in awe,
taught to reuerence their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
highly, and bee euer igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
how much liberty is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to them. For if the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a child be too malapert
and full of fiercenesse, these pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts
of lenity belong not to
him; that swelling, which the
vice of nature has engendred in
him, and which often the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
too much gentlenesse hath
ripened, and brought to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
vlcer, may bee easily lanced,
and taken away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whilest yet it
is greene, and of easie growth.
After this manner, their deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
childhood shal be freely left,
both to their own, and their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
pleasure; &amp; after they haue
fulfilled the folly of their harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
concupiscence, age it selfe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:913:11"/>
will by little and little, change
their desires; and the rootes of
vertue will spring vp in them,
which they will loue, not soe
much by heat of nature, as iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
Then they will bring to
their first youth, and twilight of
wisdome, a minde free, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
quiet, which by the vertue
of their education, is ille <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But as euery meane is directly

               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:913:12"/>
Childhood was iudged worthy
of the Romane Senate. There is
also a naturall dowry, and
wealth bestowed vpon those
yeares, a strength of capacious,

filled, that children vnwittingly
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:913:12"/>
may receiue such good things
as will afterwards grow vp in
them, whither they will or noe.
The variety also of Languages,
which is gotten by vs, with
much expence of time, will be ea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sily
taught our growing children
by often discoursing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersing
with them; so that
these things of little labour and
noe iudgement, will easily be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
vnto, by that age, which
is neither strong for labour, nor
ripe for iudgement. But if wee
shall suffer this easie, and most
memory, to grow emptily dry;
those very things must be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
learned with long and
wearisome labour, which in our
infancy, had bin better and with
lesse wearisomnes stored vp: for
what is more miserable, then to
bee enforced to spend that time
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:913:13"/>
of mans estate, which nature
hath or damed a time of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
(though too to short for
soe many Artes and Sciences) in
such things, as our empty child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
if well nurtured, had sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
vp safely in the closets of
our memories.</p>
            <p>But in the childhood, there
are often presages of future ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues,
or vices; nature beginning
to build a foundation fit for
their following abilities. <hi>Cyrus,</hi>
that first founded the <hi>Persian</hi>
Monarchy, was then beleeued
to bee a shepheards child,
when there appeared in him
that great spirit, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
put a yoake vpon the
neckes of the whole Ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t. when
he was a Boy, hee played among
Boyes of his owne age; and
being chosen King by the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:913:13"/>
chance of play, hee truly exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the regall power ouer his
play fellowes: those that were
stubborne, with a high and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident
(if not too proud) a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty
hee seuerely punished. The
fathers of those children, whom
<hi>Cyrus</hi> had beaten, complained
of it to King <hi>Astyages:</hi> the
King commanded <hi>Cyrus</hi> to bee
brought to him; who was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
daunted, nor expressed any
childish, or low feare, at sight
of the Throne, and royall Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem;
hee sayd, hee was chosen
King among the Boyes, and had
done nothing but the office of
a King. <hi>Astyages</hi> suspecting
from this some greater matters
then the present fortunes of the
Boy perswaded, enquired more
narrowly of his birth, and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentage;
and at last found him
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:913:14"/>
to be his owne grandchilde, his
daughters sonne. That <hi>Cato,</hi>
who was afterwards called <hi>Vti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censis,</hi>
from the City of <hi>Vtica,</hi>
where he killed himselfe; was
in his infancy more then a child.
When he La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:913:15"/>
which at the first appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

are of a softer nature, and moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,

you shall see, though they cry

are dry eyed: those, when they
grow vp, are of fierce natures;
or else, their dissembling and

eyther true affections, or

            <p>At their first entrance into
mans estate, the heare of blood,
and too great an apprehension
of their owne strength, doth
breede in them a wonderfull
change, and carry away their

Then indeed, doth nature
not strongly carry euery dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position

and euery kinde of humane dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,
by the conduct of

the paths of youth, are able to
direct those, which are now in

selfe-admiting not able enough
to choose friends, not to resist

could goe astray. From thence,
arises a profitable repentance,
and diligence, to repaire the
ruines, which youth has made.</p>
            <p>They are great seekers of
wealth, and honour, and soe
greedily labour to acquire the
ornaments, and supporters of
life, as if they thought, their life
were endlesse. Noe age is more
cunning, then this Middle age, in
dissembling friendshipp, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning
their affections. They
then begin, to be truely valiant,
moderating, not extinguishing
that heate of courage, by which
youth was rash<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

body. They are wary in their
vices, and loue not vertue, (for
the most part) without hope
of reward. But, old age by little
and little, like a tide, ouerflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this happy middle estate of
mans life, doth benumme his
blood, and afterward his vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing.
This age differing in ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bit,

partly encrease the vertues of
the former ages, and partly
make them degenerate into vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Feare especially, is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion
of that age, &amp; disturbeth
the minde, a seat otherwise fit,
to containe wisedome. For old

those euills, which eyther them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
haue escaped, or others
haue beene ruined by. From
hence it happens, that the
strength of counsell, and wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
the greatest endowment
of old age, is often corrupted
by too much feare, whilest it
looketh too watily, euen into
the safest things, and had rather

            <p>Happy was that delayer, who

this whose some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iest

in that, the safety of the Romane
Empire. But this one blemish in
old men, their other vertues
may well excuse; especially, their
wisedome in coniecturing of

things to come. Which wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

            <p>How many Cities, and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires,
by their wisedome, haue
beene preserued; how many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits

haue reaped thereby; as

soe daily experience may

hence, (perhaps) proceedes,
that great, and vnwearied de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of talking in old men; as if
it were a spurre, giuen by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
for feare it should be wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risome

            <p>But many of them in this

doth commonly breede an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame

               <hi>GReenewich</hi> is an ancient
seat of the <hi>Brittaine</hi> Kings,
her situations by the Thames
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:913:24"/>
side, foure miles from London.
A hill there is, that ouer tops the
palace, and at a moderate dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
of height, takes a faire
suruey both of the towne, and
riuer. You ascend to the top of
it, by other little hils; vpon the
summity of the high hill, is a
flat of great circuit. In a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
by chance I ascended thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
noe man was neere me, to
disturbe the recreation of my
thoughts, which wandred
about with delicious freedome.
But the wonderfull pleasure of
the place had almost sooner ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uished
my minde, then filled
mine eyes, with the fayrest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
not onely in Brittaine,
(but it may bee) in all Europe.
A spatious plaine commanding
from aboue the lesser hills,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:913:25"/>
and those hills enuironing round
that lofty plaine, did neither
suddenly debatre the prospect,
nor suffer the sight to bee too
much dispersed through the
emptie aire; the riuer Thames
filling the adioyning fields with
a most pleasant fruitfullnesse:
and at the foote of the hill, the
waues returning in manner of a
ring, haue almost made an Iland
of it. All along the channell,
were ships of all kindes, both
for warre and traffique; those,
that were neare, I might who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
discerne; those that were far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
off, or partly hidden, by
interposition of rising bankes,
appeared to mine eyes by their
mast, and faile yards, like a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
wood in the winter time.</p>

of pasture has exempted it from
tillage; nor hardly, is there
ground any where more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
fruitfull for grazing of
cattell. The lands of priuate men,
after the manner of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
were fenced with ditches,
whose bankes were adorned
with rowes of trees: especially
the high waies one each side
were planted with poplars, that
the whole valleys to him, that
surueyed them, from the top of
the hill, appeared like con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Nature was not forgetfull of soe

shee hath lifted to the tops of

Some, she hath scorched with

But man created after the

of this beauty of variety. For

that noe picture can with more

what excellencies of Artes?

noe diuersity. which is more

wherein they liue, forcing them

euery age of the world has a
certaine Genius, which ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruleth
the mindes of men, and
turneth them to some desires:
Some ages breath nothing, but
martiall discipline, &amp; within few

common-wealths, and
sometimes Monarchies are af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
by the people. Some Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that seemed (as it were) to
bee borne to barbarisme, in
processe of time, are brought to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:913:29"/>
perfect ciuility: and in some
few ages, are peruerted againe
to their old barbarisme. Soe the

with great abilities, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a while, industrie slackening
hath beene couered, (as it
were) with a cloud, and lost.
When the affaires of Greece
did flourish, what ciuility,
what wit, or subtilty, was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
to that Nation? Soe great
was the skill of their handy-craftes
men, that their carued
statues of men, and beasts, did
seeme almost to liue: soe fluent
their oratory, soe sweete their
poetry, that euen the ambition
of <hi>Rome</hi> proposed them to her
sons, onely to imitate, not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel.
But fortune remoouing after
ward to other Nations, noe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
more then the Graecians, did
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:913:29"/>
sorrowfully sigh at the mention
of their ancestors, from whose
ability they were then fallen.</p>
            <p>But if wee obserue the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings
of the Romane Empire,
and the passages of times nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer

discouer the changeable
Geniuses of the ages. Vnder
<hi>Augustus, Rome</hi> in peace had
adorned her greatnesse, with all
the dresses of true humanity:
and among other things, her
language was then in the height
of purity. By small things wee
may guesse at the greater. From
whence proceeded soe many
Poets of happy raptures, and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
straines in those times,
but from some certaine Spirit,
which then inspired them?
which had neuer before beene
propitious to Italian Poets, and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:913:30"/>
afterwards againe forsooke
them. Those few yeares, from
<hi>Nero</hi> to <hi>Traian</hi> had many Poets,
and many that laboured in the
study of Rhetorike; in whom
the declining of the Roman lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
did plainely apeare; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead
of the natiue beauty, and
maiesty of it, which was then
lost, they vsed obscure, and swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
heights, with forced sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
instead of naturall. At the
same time, in the reigne of <hi>Nero,</hi>
that peace was broken, which
had long setled the Romane
<hi>Empire,</hi> and all the world was
filled with combustion; nothing,
but warre was in the mindes of
all men, in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi>
and the vttermost parts of the
Easterne world. From whence
proceeded it, but from a certaine

This fault of the Frenchmen
in forreyne countries is more
cruelly raging in the bowels of
their owne land; where in all
places, like swordplayers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

suddaine and rash quarrels, they
violently hazard their liues in

From hence, soe often are the

to the open ayre, into
stalls or houses. They are vsually
contented with open sleepes in
the cold fields, and such pasture
as the moderate warmth of the
winter doth nourish. For the
winters are not there so sharpe
as the climate, and neerenesse
of the North would make vs

            <p>For the diligence of their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
when the rage of wolues
was exceeding fierce, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued
or wearied the care of
the shepheards, rooted out by
great industry the whole race
of them; soe that the hardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of their cattell, which are
able to endure the open ayre in
all seasons, and the destruction
of wolues, doe bring vnto the
people an inestimable wealth.
The inhabitants at ease, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
forgetting labour, doe
grow rich in victuals, hides,
and fleeces, as benefits which
the ground of her owne boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
doth bestow vpon them.
They scarce take any paines at
all in nourishing of saffron,
whereof they haue store, and
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:913:58"/>
exceeding good; the herbe it
selfe, not in reward of care, and
industry, but of her owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord,
opening and offering her
treasure to them. And that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
might be wanting to soe
prosperous a fortune, they haue
felt noe inuasion of forreyne
souldiers for many ages: home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
commotions in this age
are very seldome: neither doe
warrs euer long continue in
<hi>England</hi> as in other Lands. In
the compasse of eight dayes,
many times are great insurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
begun and ended. They
warre with men, not with
houses, and goods; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions,
but fresh, and newly
risen, are suddainly decided in
set battells.</p>
            <p>By reason of wealth so easily
accrewing, the carelesse, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:913:58"/>
rich common people, are not a
little puffed vp. Soe that ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(according to the vse of
other Nations (doe they hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
reuerence the dignity of
their Nobles, nor are they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustrious,
or skillfull in handy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crafts
by reason of their ease,
and plenty. For those that are
bound to any trade, doe for the
most part finish their appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiship
in seauen yeares; after
which time they are free of
the company, and then, as if
themselues were exempted
from-labour, they take other
apprentices to be vnder them:
who after a short learning are
employed as iourneymen. They
themselues, not onely on so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne,
and festiuall daies, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
holy-day (who would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue
it?) doe freely take their
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:913:59"/>
ation and pleasure, if it be faire
weather, in the fields adioyning,
or, if it be rainy, are merry in
tauernes. Which causeth a dull
and vnskillfull trading, trusted
to the knowledge of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices,
and the buyers are
more peremptorily raised to
greater prices, that the worke
of the apprentices, and the idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of the Masters may be soe
maintained. But yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
some kindes of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manship
wrought both with
industry and most exact skill,
and highly prized through the
whole world, doe sufficiently
declare, that in that country
there is noe fault in the climate,
to dull their wits, but too
much abundance to make them
idle. For as for the stirring vp of
wits, and cherishing of Arts,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:913:59"/>
too cruell, and rigorous a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment
is not at all good, too
much depressing the mindes of
the people, and dulling them
with despaire; soe too plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and wanton a fortune,
which intendeth labour, but
onely, as it were, in recreation,
and sport, can neuer raise the
industry and ability of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people, to an exact dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and skill in Arts.</p>
            <p>There are noe tributes pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
any where in that great
Kingdome, nor stations of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans
in Cities, or the passages
of bridges, except only in those
places, where shipping is set
forth into forreyne countries.
For they are strictly tyed to
make acknowledgement vnto
those, who are fanners of the
Kings customs, of all Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:913:60"/>
whatsoeuer is brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Kingdome, or carried
out.)</p>
            <p>But the pride of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people is not more bitter,
and distastfull towards stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
then towards their owne
gentry, who account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
equall almost to the best
and ancientest of them. By
which pride of the clownes,
the gentlemen doe suffer in
some, sort for the richnesse of
their country, and are brought
almost into an hatred of that
pretious cause of their indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>They are all in generall grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
honorers of the Nobility,
which is confined within the
small number of those whom
they call Lords. Those are,
Dukes, Marquesses, Earles, and
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:913:60"/>
Barons: all the sonnes of Dukes
and Marquesses, and the eldest
sonnes of Earles; in equall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
with these the piety of
their ancestors hath placed
Bishops. To these Noblemen
it is not thought a disparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
for any tostoope to the
lowest seruice; and the Nobles
vnderstand well enough, that
the people seated, as it were
on the ground, doe behold with
admiration their height, nor are
those dignities bought by the
common people for money, but
descend to their heires by right
of inheritance, or new Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
by the grant of the King,
are aduanced into those de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees;
and that you may not
thinke it a vaine title, many
Lawes and priuiledges doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
the respect of those high
names.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:913:61"/>
For if it happen that a Lord be
in debt, and not able to pay, the
creditours can haue no law to
attach his body; though the
bodies of other debtors, euen
before iudgement, are impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
in <hi>England.</hi> But this is a
greater and more glorious pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge,
that Noblemen being
accused of the greatest crimes,
as namely treason to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
are notwithstanding free
from the racke; the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ers of

that truth, if no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The English for the most

and fit for counsell; they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire

wits, and dispositions of
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:913:61"/>
their owne Nation. When they
silute, or write letters, they
scorne to descend to comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of feined seruice, which
the flattery of these ages haue
brought vp, vnlesse it be these,
which are infected with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reyne
behauiour. The people
are studious of sea-businesse;
nor is there any stronger de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
of that great Island then
the diligence of soe many say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.
They are as good souldiers
by land as by sea, especially
when they are accustomed to
another ayre, and haue tasted
of forreyne diet, which whilest
it is nouelty to them, they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
with too much greedinesse</p>
            <p>For those inconueniences of

               </gap>mies
brought from <hi>Brittaine.</hi> And
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:913:62"/>
when that Nauy, which was
sent by Queene <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued
on the shores of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall,</hi>
and had wasted the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and defeated their enemies,
the immoderate heate, and the
sweetenesse of apples, and ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
which that climate affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
destroyed almost the
whole army. They contemne
all dangers, and death it selfe,
with more courage, then iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and hence it comes, that
they are the best souldiers,
when they are gouerned by
wise captaines; but when they
goe on of their owne accord,
possessed with the blindnesse
of that desperate valour, they
haue reason, after sad defeates
to accuse themselues more then
their ill fortune. In the late
warrs of the Low-countries,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:913:62"/>
some souldiers of the <hi>Spanish</hi>
party were taken by the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers,</hi>
and were to be hanged,
in requitall of the enemies
cruelty, who had vsed their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners
in the like manner. But
the <hi>Hollanders</hi> did not intend
to execute them all. Of foure
and twenty (for soe many were
taken prisoners) eight onely
were appointed to bee hanged,
and the rest to escape with life.
There were lots therefore
throwne into a helmet, and
the prisoners were commanded
to draw their fortunes, whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer
should draw a blanke,
was to escape death; but
whosoeuer should draw a
blacke lot, was to bee hanged
presently. They were all pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
with a great apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
of their present danger:
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:913:63"/>
especially one Spaniard with
pittifull wishes, and teares, in
some of the standers by, did
mooue pity, in others laughter:
There was besides in that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
a certaine Englishman, a

a carelesse countenance, expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
noe feare of death at all,
came boldly to the helmet, and
drew his lot; chance fauoured
him; it was a safe lot. Being

and receiuing from him

that dismissing the Spaniard,
they would suffer him againe

open themselues in subtleties,

            <p>They endure with soe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
a patience all customes
and lawes, which were ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deliuered vnto them from
their ancestors, that they
account it a heynous matter
now to alter, or abrogate any
law, which was heretofore
established, eyther by reason of
the rarity of delinquents, or
innocence of the Lawmakers.
For from what reason, but the
vnwary goodnesse of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors,
comes this law to
stand in force, that a husband
is commanded to father a child
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:913:64"/>
and receiue him for his heire,
though hee were borne a yeare
or more after the time, that he
accompanyed with his wife;

            <p>But in Philosophy, and the

taedious disputations cannot
plainely state the question,
which they would seeme to
vphold: That the Earth is moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued

that the Sunne, with the Planets,
and all the other Starrs are not

               </gap>hat there are no such globes

to do: as if then they were more
deeply vile their common men,
when they neglect and slight
the ordinary wisdome as poore
and low, and search deeper into
the secrets of Nature, which
few are able to apprehend.</p>
            <p>But as nothing doth more
deepely worke vpon the minds
of men, then points of religion;
soe in noe disparations are they
more vehement then in those.
In the worship of God, what
religion soeuer they choose to
themselues, they run euer into
ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>remes. In the former ages,
their richest men leauing the
would, betooke themselues by
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:913:65"/>
oath into solitary places, and
Hermitages; soe that the best
part of the Lands of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
were bestowed vpon
such deuotion, with too timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and dangerous vow, both
to the giuers and receiuers of
those Lands; for the giuers too
much exhausted the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
and the receiuers suffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
themselues (as it were by
the fault of fortune) to fall into
luxury, did afterwards draw a
great enuy, not onely vpon
themselues, but the religion
which they professed. This
kinde of deuotion is now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
banished out of all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
and many of them are soe
much turned to the contrary
side, that he farther they tread
from the steps of their forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
soemuch the neerer they
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:913:66"/>
thinke themselues to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
            <p>Nor is that the publike opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of the State, nor any way
safe for them, if the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates
finde it; but of priuate
spirits deluded by superstition,
inuenting to themselues a new
religion of their owne, and
therefore the more pleasing.
Therefore all those, which are
once possessed with this plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
pride of vnderstanding
more then others in religion,
are diuided into diuers sects
and names; and haue diuerse
Lawes and rites established a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
them, neither by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of the men, nor the
number of them, but onely by
wilfull obstinacy; and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
which is most worthy of pity
and laughter is this; that with
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:913:66"/>
cruell censures these sects doe
persecute one another: holding
that they onely are the children
of God, and all other repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates.
It hapened one time, that
a plaine fellow one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
people (whither you e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme
the common people by
the meanesse of their estates,
or of their wit and education)
and two of his sonnes were of
one faith in a superstition of
their owne. These three men
(as often times those religions
consist of noe greater number)
did make a sest and Church by
themselues. At last, disputing
too hotly in diuinity among
themselues, they fell at discord;
the father forsooke his sonnes,
not because hee had found out

excluded out of their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

time, they thought, there were
noe other Saints in the world
but themselues. But presently
after, the two brothers falling

               </gap>us which
Ancient Writers haue ascribed
to it. Yet there are cities not
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:913:79"/>
vnworthy of some: the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket-places
and streets especially
craftly handsome; the houses
of lofty and euen structure, the
frailer parts of the building co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered
with printings.</p>
            <p>The inner parts of their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are not with like skill fitted
for vse; their beds are placed
in the remote, and (for the most
part) obscure places of the
house. They doe not vse lightly
any chimneyes at all. They had
rather vse certaine little stones
to expell the cold, which are
made in the chamber-walls, and
fire put into them according
as the quality of the weather
requireth. But this heat is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times troublesome to stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers;
for it maketh their head;
heauy with vnusuall vapours,
and when they goe one from
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:913:80"/>
thence, their bodies being chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and the pores opened, are
not able to endure the ayre.
Besides, when the fire begins
to be remitted, these kinde of
hot-houses haue ill sauours;
especially those, which belong
to their dining roomes, where
the confused vapours of soe
many sorts of meate doe fill the
ayre, and soe much wine is
drunke, and spilled. And not
onely in those hot-houses, but
in other chambers and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
also, are many of the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi>
too slouenly, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse;
insomuch that strangers,
when they come thither, can
hardly brooke the ayre of those
roomes. That Nation is infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a wonderfull loue of
drinking, which now is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
vice, and therefore the
more freely vsed. Nor is this
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:913:80"/>
barbarous drunkennesse vsed
as a pleasure onely, but growne
into a part of their behauiour
and discipline; the fauours of
some of their Princes are pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased
onely by this base price,
when the Princes doe seeke
some co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panions in their vices,

Colonels of supper, knowing
how deare a league of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
might bee made with a

him therefore to mirth,
with store of wine, and many
formes and deuices of drinking
there were. At last, the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane,</hi>
eyther to make tryall,
how freely welcome he was to

a cup of great measure; the
<hi>Frenchman</hi> nothing affrighted
(to all our wonder) rises vp:
noble guest (quoth hee) that
thou mayst know thou wert
inuited to a friend, I will not
onely pledge what thou hast
drunke, but in a louing quarrell,
challenge thee to pledge me us
much more. With these words,
hee pledges the <hi>Germane</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell
at one draught, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the same cup againe for his
guests sake, though his belly
swelled, be dranke it off to him.
The Colonell wonderfully ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

hee could hardly stand) noble

this loue is bestowed vpon an

At soe great a requitall
of one carouse, we were all
amazed for the present, but

They hate all kinde of hidden

wanteth the dresse and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:913:84"/>
of later wisedome. They
are desirous of trauell, and
great counterfeiters, or retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
of forreyne behauiour, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
they returne home into
their owne country. It is not
vsuall for strangers, to dwell
long, or rise to preferment in
that country; and the name of a
forreyner is almost accounted a
word of disgrace among them.
<hi>Germany</hi> oppressed with these
manners, is notwithstanding
recompenced againe by other
excellent endowments, and
manly vertues. Treachery is a
thinge vnknowne among them,
yea euen in hired souldiers of
that Nation. Noe deceitfull
cunning, or hatred, burketh vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the titles of friendship and
the simplicity of that modest
people is altogether vnskilfull
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:913:84"/>
in great villanies. They are lit<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tle
giuen to lust, and that in
great secret; their youths boast
not of it, like some other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
as a pride and sport; for
the men of <hi>Germany</hi> are as farre

            <p>But nothing is more mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
in that Nation, then
that the Christian Empire, and
Eagle is seated there; as if <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many</hi>
had vanquished <hi>Rome;</hi>
and the lost of the Prounces
that bowed to the <hi>Romane</hi>
yoake, it now the onely coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
where the name, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of the <hi>Romane</hi> fortune
doe rest themselues. The Sacred
Maiesty of soe great a name is
eclipsed by noe a mulation of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Princes, and Kings, though
farre greater in power, then he,
yet willingly giue place to the
Imperiall Maiesty. That highest
dignity was heretofore sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by a power answera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
which by little and little as
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:913:86"/>
were in a fatall old age, did
lessen and consume away. For
by domesticke warrs, and the
immoderate power of Princes
of the Empire, and besides, the
dignity being electiue not hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary,
the vigour of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire
falling to ground, hath one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
retained a venerable name,
more by the piety of others,
then her own strength. Among
other causes of the decay of this
power, this you shall finde to
bee the greatest; the Princes
being of great wealth, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
by the bounty of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Emperours, haue at last
changed those Prouinces,
which were first deputed vnto
them, into absolute Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
&amp; to haue some priuiledge
about the Emperour (who o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth
his estate not to right of
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:913:86"/>
inheritance, but their suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges)
they haue made their own
dignities, inheritances to their
posterity. By this meanes the
mindes of those Nations and
People, which are naturally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to honour their Princes,
and heretofore onely in loyalty
to the Emperour, came by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
to honour those Princes,
as his deputies, and afterwards
as their owne absolute Lords:
which was a nearer way, either
to profit, or danger. See the
power of those Princes begun
and strengthned, did exhaust
the strength of the whole
Empire: and first of all, as
much as remayned in <hi>France,</hi>
then <hi>Italy,</hi> it selfe, the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
of the Empire; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the strongest parts
of <hi>Germany,</hi> taken, as it
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:913:87"/>
were, out of their owne body,
did fall away, and were diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
by the variety, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Princes, into other loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties.
But in <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,</hi>
which are most true
Kingdomes, it was ordered
farre otherwise, and those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
whose power was too
great, and worthy of suspition,
by the prouidence of God, and
industry of the Kings, were sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>essed,
and rooted out. For
what roome were left for the
Maiesty and State of Kings,
if <hi>Normandy, Brittaine, Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
Burgundy, Auuergne,
P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cteirs, Prouence,</hi> and <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paine,</hi>
were possessed by Dukes,
or Earles, as once in the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of petty Kings? who safe
in their owne strength would
obey the King vpon curtesie,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:913:87"/>
and onely not contemne him
as inferiour to themselues. But
what miseries in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of <hi>Brittaine</hi> haue beene
caused by the great, and too
formidable power of Dukes,
and Count Palatines, endued
with regall priuiledges, and
mighty in faction, and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance?
what bloody rebellions
haue they oft raised against
their Kings? there is noe more
certaine safety of the Kingdome
at this day, then that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of those great men and their
Families, are vtterly suppressed,
and the nerues of the Kingdome
guided by one onely.</p>
            <p>The Emperours therefore
should then haue preuented
this renting of the Empire,
when first the Princes began
to grow too great. But now
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:913:88"/>
the disease too farre growne,
and all affaires too long setled,
so that the Empire especially
consisteth of those Princes: to
extort the power out of their
hands, were not onely an vnsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable,
but a vaine enterprise;
soe many vpholders of those
dignities would ioyne in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fedency
against him for their
common security: especially
seeing at this day, their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities
doe as lawfully belong
to them, as the Empire doth to
him; their titles accrewing
both from the consent of them
that first gaue that power into
their hands, and also by time
and long possession; whereby
all titles of Soueraignty, which
for the most part are weake, or
wrongfull at the first, are
made lawfull.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:913:88"/>
But the last and mortall
disease of the expiring Empire
was this, that many, or
most of the cities, imitating
these Princes, gathered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
into Commonwealths,
making themselues Lawes, and
ordaining Magistrates; and to
make it knowne, that they had
renounced their first loyalty,
in this sliding from the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
they challenged the name
of Free States; entering into
leagues among themselues, to
maintaine each other against
the Soueraignty of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
            <p>Soe that country which in one
State, &amp; vnder one Gouernour,
had beene able to contest with
all Europe, puissant in men, and
strong cities, and worthy to
receiue the translated dignity
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:913:89"/>
of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire can
now finde noe Prouince, nor
scarce any city, that shee can
deliuer to her Emperour in
free power and Soueraignty.
For the Commonwealths and
Principalities will suffer noe
Imperiall garrisons within them
nor can that Prince, that beares
soe great and glorious a title,
finde any place among soe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:913:89"/>
alone can neuer carry those voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
For where should the seate
of the Emperour bee, vnlesse
be had one already without the
Empire? where should that
Court bee kept, which were
answerable to the title of soe
great Maiesty? they would
hardly suffer him to dwell any
where among them, whom
they loue to honour in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.
But if the fate of that

that the whole Prouince might

            <p>The Emperour then hath
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:913:90"/>
some power (but limited and
straightned) ouer all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
In ciuill contentions they
doe often appeale to him. But
capitall crimes the Princes and
Free States doe iudge in there
owne territories. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour
has power to call diots, to
proclaime warrs, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
controuersies betweene
the Princes themselues. When
warrs doe threaten <hi>Germany,</hi>
hee commands men and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
from the Prouinces, if that
may bee termed by command,
which cannot bee obtained
without their free consent.</p>
            <p>The Free Princes in that

but the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

In that manner, the
Dukedome of <hi>Saxony</hi> was in
this age diuided among many
brothers, and because it was a
hard matter, those that were
skilfull in the lawes and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes
of the country were
by their command assembled
together. To whom, as they
sate in counsell, and the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

their right, a fellow of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
a distracted minde, but
such a one, as vsed to delight
the hearers with his harme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse
and pleasant madnesse,
came in among them.</p>
            <p>The eldest brother of
the <hi>Saxon</hi> Duke looking vpon
this fellow, (for hee had vsed

he) giue thy opinion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
this diuision of the State?
why should I not answered
the fellow? vpon which, they
were all in expectation to heare
some ridiculous and pleasant
iest from the mad-man, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
him earnestly, that his
counsell might not bee wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in soe great a matter. But
he denyed to beare any part in
the consultation, vnlesse they
would giue him such a gowne
as the Lawyers vsed to weare,
saying that with that gowne
hee should put on wisedome.
with that a merrier Genius pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed
them all, insomuch that
his Lord laughing heartily,
commanded a furrd gowne to
hee brought out of his ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:913:91"/>
and put vpon him.
Which when the fellow had
fitted well, hee walked twice
or th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ice about the roome, and
began to aske his Lord, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that garment became him
well or not; excellent well,
answered the Duke; but now
it remaines, that thy wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
should determine the
controuersies that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
vs. Hee told them, hee
would presently bee ready for
them, but first he must retire a
little into the next chamber;
and there hee would call some
spirits of better wisedome to
counsell with him. When hee
was retired thither, hee shut
the doore presently, that noe
man might enter to interrupt
his witty knauery; and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
off the gowne, with a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:913:92"/>
sword, which was girded
about him, hee cut it from the
shoulders to the lowest hemm,
into long and slender slashes.
Then putting it on all ragged
as it was, he opened the doore,
and comming out to his Lord
asked him againe, how well
that gowne did now become
him: anger had curbed his
Lords laughter, for the gowne
which was soe spoyled, was
of great price. Thou wretch
(quoth the Duke) I will haue
thee whipt, for presuming soe
madly to spoyle thy Lords
gowne. The fellow not at all af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted,
answered them thus
how ridiculous is it in you t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is the representation of your

doe you goe about to

or <hi>Saxony,</hi> then I haue done
this garment. Whilst it was
whole, it become met well, and
you laugh at it, now it is thus
mangled.</p>
            <p>Soe <hi>Saxony</hi> vnited in one
body doth flourish, and is pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>issant
in armes and wealth; but
when you haue rent it into ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
peeces, noe man can vphold
the ancient dignity.</p>
            <p>The wealth of the <hi>Germane</hi>
Princes, besides some taxes
and tributes, are, for the most
part, arising out of flockes
and heards of cattell; as alsoe
out of the fertilty of the soyle,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:913:93"/>
which commonly they exercise
with the voluntary, not hired
labour of the Boores. By this
meanes they cannot certainely
define their wealth, and annuall
reuenew, which is to be valued
according to the changeable
price of come. The Nobility
haue a great and superstitious

               </gap>
lower or vpstart Family; nor
is such a slaine washed away in
many generations. For to a
cleare testimony of Noble
birth, are required eight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scents
of ancestors in both
lines, which haue not at all
beene tainted with this vne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall
marriage. In their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
they haue certaine
titles and formes of speech fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:913:93"/>
to all conditions of man;
which they account it almost
a sin, eyther to neglect, or came

Nation vse more set formes,
ouerburdening euen the
memory of those who from
their child-hoods haue beene
trained in that Art, and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious

            <p>In that part of <hi>Belgia,</hi> which
is accounted in <hi>Germany,</hi> are
those Prouinces, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
by war, marriages and
successions were incorporated
together vnder the house of
<hi>Burgundy;</hi> and afterwards
transferred by marriage to the
<hi>Spaniard;</hi> and the chiefe
strength of that Nation, if they

of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cord, by which they were
tied both to their Prince, and
among themselues, haue risen
in soe great a storme, as may
well deserue to put all Europe
into a feare. In this commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
part of them by armes haue
acquired their liberty; the rest
either mastered by power, or
detained by loyall reuerence
of their ancient Lords, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
still in obedience to their
Prince. Those that despising
the Soueraignty of the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard,</hi>
haue made themselues a

about the <hi>Ocean,</hi> and are called
by forreyne Nations <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
which was the chiefe

to sea-affaires; from
whence they are growne to
great strength and wealth, sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
all shores, and infesting
the <hi>Spanish</hi> Sea. By this meanes,
their cities are encreased, and
their wealth, by daily boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
Auxiliary souldiers from
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> haue
come vnto them, by reason
of that mutuall benefit, which

But the people, though thus
distinguished into two Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernements,
retaine the same
Genius and dispositions. Their
wits are candid, but made
grosser as it were by the fault
of the climate, which yet they
doe more depresse by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
of drinking; whither
this thirst bee kindled in them
by the fortune of their situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and neighbour-hood of
High-<hi>Germany;</hi> or by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of educating their, infants.
For they giue to their infants

whilst yet they hang at their

beere, made after the fashion
of a dugge.</p>
            <p>That innocent and vncuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
age oftentimes listing to
the mouth the beere which
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:913:95"/>
comes soe slowly, is delighted
with the likenesse of sucking,
and keept from the wearisom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of idlenesse. Nor is the
thing without some profit, if
from their first growth onely
you esteeme it.</p>
            <p>For infants soe ordered are
brought to haue strong bodies,
and full of cheerefull and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
iuyce. But the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
custome of drinking, grows
by soe vsing it into a perpetuall
pleasure, stirring vp the desire
of the palate, which is euer af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
eyther ouerflowed,
or thirstie. To this may bee
added, the qualitie of that
drinke, not quenching the
thirst after the manner of wine
and water, but in a thicke li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor,
leauing first that vpon
the iawes, which by the next
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:913:96"/>
draught would bee washed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.</p>
            <p>But by this strange de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in drinking their wits
(which you would wonder at)
are not drowned, and made
slothfull, but industrious in all
the artes of merchandise, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the diligence of other
Nations.</p>
            <p>Their strong and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
bodies are able to
buckle with that vice, and with
a wondrous felicity dissipate
againe those clouds of drinke,
which in banqueting arise in
them: soe that their drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
late at night makes them
not slothfull in their businesse
the next morning.</p>
            <p>None excell their industry
in low arts. Idlenesse with
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:913:96"/>
more then <hi>Athenian</hi> seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
is punished among them;
their boyes (if neede bee,
at the publike charge) are
trained vp in action, and
their maides to the spindle;
euery age is exercised, and
sweat in a fitting calling; and
labour familiar to them from
their child-hood, banishes,
euen by custome alone, the
loue of vnknowne sloth. By
this frugall discipline their
cities are wonderfully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched
with trading, and
few of them sleepe in the
lethargy of beggery. The
wits of the people are ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>The Boores of <hi>Holland</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited

reuolting from the <hi>Spaniard:</hi>

bee brought to an impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable

            <p>Therefore at the beginning
of their reuolt, <hi>William</hi> by a
new way of popularity had
wonne all the affections of the
people, who thought in how
much more happy a condition
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:913:100"/>
they should liue vnder such a
Captaine, as owed his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
and authority to them,
then vnder the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe.</p>
            <p>For comming slouenly from
sea or the plow, they had free
accesse to him, whose Maiesty,
and attendance was not great
or troublesome. Hee himselfe
in a deepe subtlety, was glad
to haue himselfe saluted by
those, that met him or came to
him, by noe high or enuied
names, but sometimes plaine
<hi>William</hi> And very well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by what waies especially
the affections of his Nation
were to bee gained, hee did
not proudly looke vpon the

saluted him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:913:101"/>
Remarkable was that
saying of his, to content

            <p>Of pasture-grounds there is

to haue beene especially suted
to that country.</p>
            <p>Their Cities are for the

pleasant places.</p>
            <p>Their houses built of no
slight matter, especially those
which they call Palaces, are
commonly more beautifull for
the greatnesse of their struct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure,

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:913:104"/>
They glitter with marble of
diuers kinds, and sometimes
with gold; their roofes exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
with magnificent worke.
Old eaten statues are placed
vpon faire &amp; precious suppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
which for their gorgeous
places are sometimes indebted
onely to the lying report of
those that fell them. But where
their walls doe afford space for
windowes, there their houses
doe lose somewhat from the
lustre of the other building. For
commonly eyther coorse lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen,
or oyled paper doe couer
those places which are ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
for letting in of light.
Which thing as it is vnsightly
to the beholders, so it impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
the eyes of the dwellers
within; the bounds of their
Parlour or gallery doores, farre
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:913:105"/>
from the comelinesse of the
<hi>French</hi> or <hi>Brittish</hi> manner,
where their windowes are
made of glasse, affording them a
free prospect of that which is
without, the beames of light
dancing as it were cheerfully vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them. Their temples also
(for that is part of their fame)
doe not fully answere the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation

lustre, and nothing more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull
then their altars. Purple &amp;

of different marbles are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned

where in suteable colours
the figures of flowrs, of birds, &amp;

a beauty in their building,
is not brought to the height of
comlinesse, their roofs being not
enough raised, and the free sunne
scarcely is admitted into those
dark places. Their windows are
shadowed with much iron, and
thicke pictures wrought vpon
them if any temple do chance to
receiue light eyther by the rarity
of buildings neere, or conuenient
situation of the doores, then ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

            <p>But fortune has found out

that which they owe to their

For if you loue men of your

of forremers, you haue faire

so many nations: especially the
commerce of mindes so farre

that to be fellow trauailers, is a

            <p>So from all Prouinces they

            <p>Yet are their mindes ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of all affaires. Nor
with a rude heare, or natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
instinct, but artificially as
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:913:108"/>
it were, and with skill they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
eyther vertue or vice.
They make large promises of
humanity, confirmed not onely
by a compleat garbe of their
persons, but words of most
exact ciuility, and when they
please, most powerfull in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion.
They can also enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
long friendship, and where
they truely loue, esteeme no
dangers in respect of that sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
league. But if they once
hate (whether by their owne

iniury) they are so much the
more full of danger, in that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their disquiet thoughts,
they deepely lay vp the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of their offence or emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Sometimes being offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
they will descend to courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
that so by the priuiledge of
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:913:108"/>
friendship, they may more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly

            <p>This hatred of theirs will
outlast an age, and which is
the most mischieuous, their
minds are neuer so easie woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
as obstinate in bearing the

wisedome is most vnwelcome
euery where, that euen then
when they doe descend into a
free and vnsuspicious familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
they are thought but spies,
and censurers of other mens
actions. Their impoysonings
and damned lusts I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
omit, because they are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
not proper alone to <hi>Italy;</hi>
seeing it were iniustice to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
that especially to one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which is so rife ouer all

countryes. Seeing besides that
those villanies are wrought in
secret, and may not onely bee
denyed by those that are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but deuised by others ill-affected
to them. But there is a
great and publike opinion of
their cruelty, such cruelty as rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
in that Country doe vse to
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:913:109"/>
passengers, and priuate enemies
one against another; nature ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing

is most cruell, and the reuenge of
enemies most barbarous. For
<hi>Italy</hi> beeing most forward,
and profuse in obsequiousnesse
and courtesie, reaches on
the contrary the extremity
of cruelty in the dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of her theeues, and those
that are at enmity. The <hi>French</hi>
which embrace friendship, not

do renut somewhat also in
their entity of the <hi>Italian</hi> cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city;

the <hi>English</hi> which want some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what

and the necessary,
yet heauy yoake of those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
vnder whose protection
they were forced to put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Lombards</hi> both in

have mixed, as it were,
the Image and Genius of
<hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances
and garbes being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to the fashions of the

the <hi>Italian</hi> qualities, and
filled on both sides with the
vertues and vices of both Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>The other regions of <hi>Italy</hi>
are vnder the command of
their owne princes; they are
little States, and therfore to be
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:913:113"/>
gouerned with the greater
skill, as small barkes in the
midd'st of a wide Ocean. And
seeing that in such small Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinces
the maiesty of a Prince
cannot bee richly supported,
but by great tribute and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions,
long and wholesome cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
hath taught those people
not onely to bee industrious in
getting of wealth, but also not
to denie it to the vse of their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne
Princes.</p>
            <p>But there is nothing so hard
for humane diligence to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
but the excellency of an
<hi>Italian</hi> wit will aspire to it.
From the meanest rankes of
their common people many dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by happy industry doe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance
themselues, both to great
name and plentifull estates. No
kinde of cares, or (if neede bee)
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:913:114"/>
no condition of humility will
they disdaine, if it promise
wealth; long paines and long
hopes they will vndertake
and foster: one of which, the
pride of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> the other
the suddaine and hot dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>French</hi> will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.
They haue deepe and able
mindes for the gouerning of
Commonwealths, and fit for
any fortune; frugall men, and
prouident of the future.</p>
            <p>Many among them can write
Latin, but not speake it so well.
That language also which vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly
they vse, though it bee
nothing else then a mixture of
barbarous words with corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Latin, yet both in speaking,
and writing they striue to alter,
as farre as they can, from all
markes of the originall; and to
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:913:114"/>
that end they draw backe the
words into their throates, so
that the roughnes of the sound,
and contraction of words (for
scarce do they come wholy to
your eares) may seeme to bee
nothing a-kin to the old Latin.
After that manner hath <hi>Spaine</hi>
also at this day infected her lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
so that drowning the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
of words, with a confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
harshnes, forced as it were
from their brests, they lose
the sweetenesse of many letters:
but the sweetnesse of learning
doth not a little flourish in <hi>Italy,</hi>
especially those parts of learning
to which the liuely elegance
of nature doth inuite them:
which is witnessed by that faire
plenty of their natiue poetry
enuy'd by all their neighbour-nations;
which hath made
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:913:115"/>
sacred the Poets names, bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in so many fained fires of
loue, to the renowning of their
supposed sufferings. For it is no
matter whether they expresse
themselues in their owne lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
or in the old learned
tongues, seeing it is the same
rapture which leades a pure and
rich wit in their owne popular
eloquence, as well as in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient.
For the <hi>Grecians</hi> wrote
those things which their peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
vnderstood, and the <hi>Romans</hi>
fitted the Greeke Comedies,
and all the pith of <hi>Athenian</hi> elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to the eares of their
common people.</p>
            <p>Last of all, what shall we say
of <hi>Italian</hi> Historians, those
whose sincere and faithfull wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
shall eternize their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings?
or those that offend by
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:913:115"/>
too much eloquence and partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity?
but religion, and heauenly
wisdome, as well as humane lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
with whatsoeuer is left in
the custody of the Muses, was
euer highly indebted to the wits
of that Nation. And to conclude,
you shall no where finde more
true examples of sacred vertues,
or abominable vices, then in
<hi>Italian</hi> mindes: so that as one
sayd of <hi>Athens,</hi> There growes in
no place more venomous hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locke;
nor any where else are
the Bee-hiues filled with
extraction of swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
flowers.

continued there, and liking the
country, married a wife in it.
Whom whilst he loued dearly
and by all kindenesses sought to
gaine mutuall affection from
her; she with a sad deiected
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:913:141"/>
countenance did often sigh,
and expresse other tokens of a
sorrowfull minde. At last when
hee demanded the cause of her
sadnesse, professing that hee had
beene wanting in no office of
loue to her. Why (quoth the
woman) doe you so cunuingly
counterfeit affection? doe you
thinke I know not how little
you regard me? and withall she
began to make great lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
He amazed at this, began
to embrace her, and still asked
her wherein hee had offended,
and if perchance hee had done
ill, hee would hereafter amend
the fault.</p>
            <p>To this his wife answered,
Where are the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> those stripes by
which thou testifiest thy loue?
For husbands among vs by bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

When <hi>Iordan</hi> heard this, amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
a while suppressed his
laughter, but afterward when
they doth vanished, hee
thought it his best course to
vse his wife as shee had prescri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed;
and not long after, hee
tooke occasion to beate the
woman: shee appeased with
stripes, began then earnestly
to loue and obserue he: hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
But hee could keepe no
measure, but grew more cruell

to which on the North

these are the regions, out of
which so great Nations, famed
both for their multitude and
victories, rushed like a whirle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winde
ouer all Europe. From
thence came the <hi>Cimbrians,
Tentones, Goths,</hi> and <hi>Vandals;</hi>
by whom <hi>Italy, Libya, Spaine,</hi>
and a part of <hi>France</hi> were sore
afflicted.</p>
            <p>But of later times those Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies
that came from thence,
were called <hi>Normans</hi> (that

<hi>Britaine</hi> was long possessed;
and much of <hi>France</hi> wasted
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:913:142"/>
with fire and sword; but there
atlast, after many dangers, peace
was compounded, and they
seated in <hi>Neustria,</hi> which they
afterwards called <hi>Normandy,</hi>
so that nothing in Europe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scaped
their fury; and being
terrible to all, they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
accounted to bee inuin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible.
How it should come to
passe that so great a multitude,
and a spring (as it were) of
Nations should at this day
grow drie, it is vncertaine.
But fore it is, that now in those
countries, townes are very rate;
and they are so farre from
fending Colonyes abroade,
that when they haue warre,
they are enforced to vse for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine
souldiers. I could beleeue
that those barbarous Nations,

<pb n="272" facs="tcp:913:143"/>
soile, and ignorant of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
encreased in Children; and
because the vnfruitfulnesse of
the soile denyed nourishment
to so numerous a people, they
did often send out their young
men to seeke out new plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
which then men of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
did desire. But now by that
mad vice of tipling and surfets
they haue ouer whelmed their
genitall strength, and can beget
inhabitants for no more then
their owne countries. They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede
the <hi>Germans</hi> in drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.
When they awake in the
morning they fil their stomacks
with a wonderfull hot kinde of
drinke, which by the fire is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
from Wine it selfe.
When they are thus refreshed,
the fumes of that hot liquor
ascending into their heads, doe
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:913:143"/>
cause sleepe; their rest is but
short, and then they returne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
to drinking. Then they
drinke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wine or Ale, as many a
like it. That time that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
till noone, they bestow
in businesse.</p>
            <p>At last they meete at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
which by continued dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
they make no bones
many times to prolong till sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

carried to bed, neyther apt to
doe nor receiue wrong.</p>
            <p>They breake no promises,
when their hands are giuen.</p>
            <p>There are among them

arriued in <hi>Norway.</hi> And not
long after, the shippe that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him, as if it had beene set

            <p>The thing was told to King
<hi>Iames,</hi> who had presently a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of seeing this vnusuall
sight. For about none of his
<hi>Britaine</hi> shores doth the sea
freeze.</p>
            <p>There was (the weather
being faire) a hauen not farre
from the Kings lodgings; he
went therefore along, the
windes neyther blowing, nor
the aire (as it seemed) very vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
cold; and beholding a

into his chamber, suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing of the danger of
the Winter. But when hee
drew neere to the fire, one of
those that stood about him,
looking by chance vpon the
Kings right hand, perceiued
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:913:145"/>
that finger that was next the
thumbe, to bee blue, pale, and
bloodlesse; and knowing the
condition of that aire, cryed
out to the King not to come
neere the fire; the ayre, s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in this case, the fire with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seasonable
heat will quite vndo
it. The plague of this cold must
bee expelled by another cold.
The King wondering at this,
denyed at first that he was hurt
at all; for hee felt no paine:
but hee shortly perceiued, that
hee was well aduised. For the
finger grew stiffe and dead,
losing all sence and heate of
blood.</p>
            <p>When hee desired remedy,
they told him there was at

hand a certaine cure, which
with a short, though cruell
paine, should restore his health,
and that hee must indure it, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse

then there was suddainely

restored to the finger. By this

of such an vnlook'd for mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe,

of the world, by barbarous vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,

obedience to seuere discipline
hath growne great. Their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
was from <hi>Scythia,</hi>
which wee call <hi>Tartaria.</hi> From
thence they were called as

            <p>
               <pb n="282" facs="tcp:913:148"/>

in the heat of their first victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:
where (to our shame) they
ruined those mighty enemies,

with the situation of

and Europe, as also the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenience
of a most stately hauen,
and the fame of that Empire
which so many ages had there
flourished.</p>
            <p>That which remained in the

The <hi>Persian</hi> was to the <hi>Turke</hi> an

and cruell warre with them
about the bounds of their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
They both made league
with the <hi>Aegyptian Souldan:</hi>
but <hi>Selymus</hi> the <hi>Turke,</hi> thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
that the <hi>Souldan</hi> did more
religiously obserue his league
with the <hi>Persians,</hi> made that
an occasion of warre against
him. Neuer in so short a warre
was there gained a greater
victory for spoiles, for men,
and Countreyes; and which
is more, a constant possession
of them. For by two set bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels,
and one tumultuary fight,
all the dominions, wealth, and
armes of the <hi>Souldan,</hi> were by
fortune translated to <hi>Selymus.</hi>
From hence, hee grew more
terrible to <hi>Persia,</hi> and began
with ascornefull pride to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looke
the wealth of Europe.
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:913:149"/>
But returning from <hi>Syria</hi> in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
hee ended his life by a
sharpe disease in the same place,
where once hee fought a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
against his father <hi>Baiazethe</hi>
as if his fathers <hi>Manes</hi> had
claimed a reuenge. But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
<hi>Solyman,</hi> more furious
then his father, inuaded <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonia,</hi>
and taking <hi>Buda,</hi> which
is the head of <hi>Hungary,</hi> hee
presumed to besiege the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strian
Vienna.</hi> But the pleasures
of <hi>Constantinople</hi> did by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
mollify the mindes of
those Princes, and auert them
from our ruines. But wee in
the meane time weakened with
warres among our selues, and
emulation of nations; blush
not to expect from the <hi>Turks</hi>
hands warre or peace, daring
to offer nothing against them,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:913:150"/>
but contented if not prouo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
wee send Embassadours

of so many victories
hath raised, almost beyond hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
greatnesse, the maiesty of
the <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperour; so,
(which is wonderfull) it hath
made the people wretched, by
whose hands and strength the
Empire was raised. For when
the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Princes were yet
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:913:150"/>
low, and contained within their
campe, almost their whole na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
then surely what prey
or dignity they would diuide,
must bee diuided among those
souldiers, nor had they any
beside those <hi>Scythians</hi> to ioyne
in friendship with. But their
wealth increasing, and they
free in choice whom of their
owne or conquer'd nations to
preferre to gouernements in
the commonwealth, their grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
honours are neuer besto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed
vpon the ancient race of
<hi>Turkes,</hi> the posterity of those
souldiers, from whom the <hi>Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman</hi>
family receiued toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the Empire, a power
to bee now safely vnthankfull
to them.</p>
            <p>Wee cannot tell, whether
through disdaine, or custome
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:913:151"/>
which among barbarous people
(is in stead of religion) or
through secret policy for secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
of their Empire, it come to
passe that great gouernements,
dignities, and places of iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
are conferred on none but
those which are borne of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
parents. From <hi>Dalmatia</hi>
especially and <hi>Illyricum,</hi> Boyes
and Girles are taken from the
bosome of their parents, to bee
cloistered vp in <hi>Constantinople.</hi>
There they change into a mad
superstition the religion of their
fathers, which they cannot
remember, and beeing circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised,
are trained vp in the
religion of <hi>Mahomet.</hi> And this
company so taken by rapine, are
to the <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperour as a
seminary of Captaines and
Princes, to whome the guard
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:913:151"/>
of his person and the strength
of his Empire is committed.
From hence are taken his Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs
for neerest seruices, and
therefore there not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible.
From hence are his
wiues and concubines, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
the mother of that heire
that must succeede in so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>reat
an Empire. Out of that band
hee chooses husbands for his
Aunts and sisters, to beget Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins
and Nephews to him. And
so farre is it growne aduanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
not to bee borne of the
<hi>Turkish</hi> race, that those chiefe
places in the Empire, which
those that are borne of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
parents doe hold, neuer
deuolue vnto their children.
And for no other reason, then
that they were borne to the
Lawes and Rites of <hi>Turkie.</hi>
               <pb n="290" facs="tcp:913:152"/>
This doth that Nation suffer,

forbids them to polish their

they may be drawne with

that Law which hee hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed.</p>
            <p>Their chiefest care is about
their houshold stuffe, their
flockes and heards of cattell.
Their buildings are scarce for

but their countreyes. By
an inbred affection they doe

            <p>The cruellest in that Nation,
and the greatest haters of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians,
are not those that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued

would beleeue it? they require
not a tast nor touch, a little aire
corrupting the vitall parts will
bring death, and that a quicke
one. A <hi>Bashaw</hi> lately had bought
the gouernment of <hi>Aleppo,</hi> of
some that were gracious in the
Court. It is a City not two

is brought, partly by

by land-carriages. From whence
the Gouernours get great
wealth, and rob the Prouince
as licenciously as they buy the

therefore was sent to his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

(as is likely) sadly strucken
with it; hauing as yet scarce got
any thing to recompence his

therefore calls a counsell of his
friends, and among them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines
of the losse of his estate,
and the perfidiousnesse of the

in doubt, whether hee should
obey the letters which called

The <hi>Turkish</hi> Emperour passing
thorow <hi>Constantinople</hi> to hunt
in the adioyning fields, spyed at
a souldiers doore a young youth
want only glancing his effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
eyes. The lust of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Prince was kindled, and hee
commanded the Youth to bee
taken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and carried into his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace.
But the souldier that abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the boy, loue ouercomming
his allegiance, ventured himself
to rescue his Catamite, &amp; with a
drawn sword resisted the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ministers. But what could
one doe against a multitude?
The Emperour that vsed to be
bloodily enraged at any diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
of his men, yet cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
not so ill this souldiers vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence

for the losse of his boy, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:913:158"/>
his stipend to be increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed.
Immediately the Prince bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in lust with this Catamite,
and kept him not onely for his
pleasure, but ranked him highly
in his friendship. Which when
the souldiers heard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> hee desired
much to see his once deare loue
now in such high honour. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by entreaty and gifts hee
preuailed with the guard at
the doore, that when the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
dined in his garden, hee
closely at their backes might
see him and the youth together
(for hee was alwaies admitted
to banquet with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.)
At the appointed time
hee came: the Emperour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
that country-fashion sate
downe on the carpets, and by
him the impute Catamit, proud
with too great rewards of his
vnchastity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="303" facs="tcp:913:158"/>
The souldier by chance vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily
stept forth from his
place, so that the Youth spied
him, who remembring his old
seruice, ranne speedily to him,
and kist his hand. The Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
when the Boy returned,
starting vp, and viewing him
with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

eye, asked him whither (false
as he was) hee had turned. Sir
(quoth hee) to my old master;
whom I could not chuse but
salute at least. Immediately the
Emperour mad, that hee had a
Riuall, with a short sword,
which hee wore about him,
thrust the Boy thorow. But
when he saw him fall, hee fell
vpon him to the Earth, and
with his brest coue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing the
wound, hee bewailed his death.
The souldier presently was
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:913:159"/>
commanded to dy, as being the
occasion of so great sorrow to
his Prince; but hee breaking
thorow the tumult, escaped by
the fauour of the guard, and lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked
in concealement till the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour
was appeased. So that no

            <p>But the warres in that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>Besides many helpes which

            <p>They say that <hi>Charles,</hi> the

the first part of his age, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
free from warlike Actions,
but in a wonderfull loue of quiet
and repose; afterward, when

warre, which they called the

were turned so quite contrary,
that no part of his life was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
free from military
action. God forbid that <hi>Achmet</hi>

idlenesse, not extruded by
vs, nor hearing our Armes

wee shall owe this (almost

among so many ages,
and names of people, hath
sound out for euery man his
owne lineaments, that may
distinguish the habite of his
visage and minde from the
likenesse of other mindes and
bodies. From hence can no
man sooner by contemplation
finde out the wonderfull play
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:913:171"/>
of nature, varied in the minds
and affections of so many
men: than a painter in his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
can include the formes
and similitudes of all bodies.
Yet let it bee lawfull for us to
survey, as eminent trees in
a thicke Wood, the chiefe
kinds of dispositions and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions,
of which men use to
be composed, and by them
wholly swayed, and notably
distinguished from other
men.</p>
            <p>Nor shall it bee a superflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
meditation to recount,
and examine so many diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
rankes of men; in which
every one may finde himselfe,
and see as it were in a seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
mirrour, what himselfe
would eyther wish or feare
to bee. And since no kind of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:913:171"/>
disposition is so neare borde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
upon vice, and leaning to
it, but by the raines of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
may be restrained, and
kept in the right way: and
none so neare a kin to vertue,
but by ill usage may bee cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted;
it will be good to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template
the affections of
men as they are attended with
good or ill, and search out how
farre they may be hurtfull or
availeable; lest we be missed
immoderately to praise some;
and too unjustly to underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
others.</p>
            <p>As we recount the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of men, those of a sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
and extemporary wit
shall be our first; those, that
as often as they list to speake,
can in a suddaine facetious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
run through an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:913:172"/>
These men, if they want
just weight (as many times
it is) as neyther eloquent by
study, nor wise in counsell;
but then onely O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ators or
Philosophers while they talk,
may bee valued at such a rate
as those wares which beeing
vaine and uselesse of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
doe by an adulterate
varnish cosen the beholder.
Of them there are two kinds;
some in private and close dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses
excell with a short and
stinging wit, ever intent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the follies of other. The
other sort comes nearer to the
dignity of eloquence, and
whensoever they please pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
or at home to discourse,
their wit is like a torrent, and
their memory doth opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
prompt them with all
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:913:172"/>
things that they have either
seene or read. The bravery of
both these sorts is admired
not onely by the ignorant, but
sometimes by those of better
learning: when they see ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
jests and sentences with
great ease and suddainnesse
flow from such men, which
themselves not without much
paines and study are able to
expresse.</p>
            <p>For whom can we imagine
to come nearer to the image
of industry and elegance,
than those suddaine wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
menne (to beginne
with them?) What is
more elegant than to finde a
pretty sentence for every ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument?
What more court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than to answer all that is
done or spoken either with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:913:173"/>
a suddaine jest, or such a wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
as being easie and at
hand, is pleasing for the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of it? If this graceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
bee joyned with a faire
personage, and a secure
(though not immoderate)
boldnesse, it will be praedomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
in all societies, and bee
pleasing even to those men
which are hit by the jests;
nay the noyse of it will drown
the true and exact wisedome
of a blest slow men. But this
felicity in speaking is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
with its proper diseases.
Take them from priuate com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
from suddaine and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
sentences, from bandying
of wit, to an argument of lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
discourse: then out of
doubt thou shalt con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>emne
the barrennesse of their empty
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:913:173"/>
mindes, not being furnished
for true and lasting wisedome.
Nay if those very concise say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and fine flashes, which
thou admirest in them, were
written downe; that they doe
not onely come forth by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
and vanish againe, but be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
by judgement; how
idle and foolish would those
things seeme, which by a
vaine praeiudice, and grace of
celerity did before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>?
Therefore in those men there
is no deepe and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>asting riuer
of wit, but suddaine flouds
of Nature; for as small wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from high springs, straigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
in their passage, doe
fall with the greater noyse
downe: so these sparkes of
wisedome, which would
presently expire, unlesse they
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:913:174"/>
were caught, doe flye with a
more vigorous noyse out of
the custody of these narrow
mindes, which are onely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in such a kind of abortive
wisdome.</p>
            <p>But the other sort, which
are copious in longer elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and fitted continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
with an unexhausted store
of words and sentences, are
famous men among the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
when they are heard in
publike assemblies, Churches,
or pleading. They are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
also in private society,
if they bee able to bee some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
silent. But as all living
creatures by a secret instiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
loue to be doing of that
thing, in which they are most
able; so these men especially
delighted in their owne elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:913:174"/>
wherein they excell,
can hardly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>taine themselves
within a meane when all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> are; that
you may iustly wonder, that
such absurd men should speak
so well. When their tedious
discourse is done, and they
see those men whom their
discourse hath wearyed, to
looke cheerfully, they doe not
consider that the other are
onely glad to bee dismissed
from the trouble of their tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
talke, but thinke them
ravished with a pleasant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration,
and goe away re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved
to entertaine them in
that manner againe the next
time they meet. These large
minds, opened by Nature it
selfe to the <hi>Series</hi> almost of
all things, are never exact, or
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:913:175"/>
thoroughly soaked in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
but cursorily they taste
of all things. And as an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho
can neyther keepe in those
last words which it receives,
nor dive any farther into the
sentence, so these men with
a wonderfull ease, and before
they are aware (as it were)
are guided by Nature to the
first glympses of all things and
Sciences, but they are scarce
able to doe, or (almost) to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>fectly or
exactly in them. I should
thinke it a great argument
that it is only chance &amp; heat,
not iudgment of the mind,
which brings from them so
great a copiosity of things,
and undigested elegancies;
since whatsoever they chance
to discourse of, they never
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:913:175"/>
faile of this pompous plenty
of words and sentences. But
whensoever their memory, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in the very course of their
speech, prompts them with
any thing, they presently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
to that, and anone to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
matter, as it happens;
and at last, lost in many sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects,
they remember not
the originall of their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
            <p>They therefore beeing of
wandering minds and setled
in nothing, are usually una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to attaine not onely to the
highest Prudence, but even
the common discretion of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men. Some of them
are immoderate pra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sers of
themselves; others not helpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to their friends nor them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in those offices, which
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:913:176"/>
diligent and setled industry
should be fitted to. They are
for the most part unconstant,
and as they waver in actions,
so they easily fly from those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions,
which they seemed
strongly addicted to. Yet
notwithstanding, as they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
a great shew of a polite dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
adorned with all
kindes of science, in matter
of fame and wealth, they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
possesse the rewards
which are due to true wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome;
especially if they doe
understand their owne faults
as well as abilities, and know
subtilly how to hide, at least
from the common peoples
eyes, their spots and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festions.
This especially is
attained, if they can governe
themselves in talking, and not
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:913:176"/>
wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der whither soever their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires
carry them; and, because
by eloquence, as the best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment,
all things are made
gratefull to the eares, let them
by a nice deflection fit divers
discourses to divers men, and
alwayes of that nature as may
bee able to goe beyond the
hearer; as for example, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
Souldiers or men igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of antiquity, let them dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
of divine points, of the
rites of the ancients, of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginall

and whatsoever hath a

in the sciences; among
Schollers which have onely
lived in study and contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
not employment; let

of Princes; and lastly
contend with no man in his

in the mixing of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
to fall upon those
things which are strange and

since new things are

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
a higher, and more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
opinion of that which
we doe not know. These O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratours
are in least danger
when they converse with men
of a low and narrow disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
who reverence every
thing as sacred and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,
which a bold eloquence
puts upon them. Therefore
they alwayes take those parts
which according to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the hearers, they
thinke most advantagious to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:913:177"/>
their fame. Which is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
easie to them, because
their diffused wits are capable
of some instructions in all
arts and sciences. Nature, &amp;
little use enabling them to
speake not improperly in all
things; though they cannot
bee sayed to bee learned in
them, but onely not to be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of them.</p>
            <p>But for such Oratours, to
write, is commonly as hard
and fatall to their fame, as to
speake is easie and gracefull to
them. For to that easily fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

eloquence the strength of
judgment is seldome ioyned,
which must continue the stile
gracefull to posterity. For
their prompt, and almost tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent
mind, when in that
leysure, which is giuen to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:913:178"/>
Writers, it revolveth it selfe,
is overladen with the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of fancies that meet, and
confusedly oppressed with its
owne wealth, can neyther
write all which it doth invent,
nor iudiciously elect the best.</p>
            <p>Lastly, the way of writing
is so different from that of
speaking, and requiring other
kind of Nerves, that euen he,
who by a strong eloquence
could freely run over what he
list, in writing doth make
but vaine stroakes, and such
as men in their dreames at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
Yet blinded and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
with their owne and
others flattery, they doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
times, by an itch of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
destroy that same which
they had gotten by eloquence.
They should doe better for
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:913:178"/>
themselves, by farre, to keepe
the world in a long expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of their writing; than to
publish bookes to the hazard
of their fame.</p>
            <p>By these cautions, that

may conceale his owne weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
from the peoples eyes,
and rise in an opinion of wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
whether hee bee able
to governe himselfe (which
you shall not often see) or
will admit counsell, and bee
quiet at the perswasion of his
friends: as those, that are but

that they are not sober, nor
will they with too stubborne

daring to depart from his

            <p>There are some among

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>situdes of the yeare.
Those men themselves, who
do with such absurd praises
extoll the Muses, doe not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
that man only absolute,
who is adorned with all kinds
of science; but count it enough
to make him so, if he doe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell
in any one kinde of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
as if an excellent O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratour
bee unfit for contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:913:183"/>
Philosophy, or if a
Philosopher be not capable of
eloquence, and altogether
ignorant of history and Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
yet they will not exclude
him from the number of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
and excellent men. That
praise therefore, which any
one part of learning may
gaine, how dare they detract
from that Science, which
consists in governing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and is farre more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
than any thing belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
to Mankind! Doe they
thinke that wisdome speakes
to her Schollers onely in
Greeke and latine, and not
rather by a secret inspiration,
containing the worth of all
languages? It were a poore
thing to be borne of an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
mind, if that excellency
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:913:183"/>
lay in nothing but a dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
fitted for Academicall
learning. Those, whom we
account the first Authors of
learning, did not sweat in the
Schooles, and yet we thought
them borne under good stars.
To compose the manners of
the people, to strengthen
their Countrey with whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
counsell, to examine
forreinerites, and transport
those that are good, into
their owne land: to observe
also the motions of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
least the seasons of the
yeare, for profitable uses of
the people, should not bee
knowne: This then was
learning, and this our letter'd
men doe but onely imitate.
For when those ancients did
strive to teach humanity and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:913:184"/>
vertue to the rude mindes of
the ignorant people, civill
Philosophy by that meanes
had her originall; when they
contended against each other
to perswade the people to this
or that action, eloquence had
then her beginning. Lastly,
what doth history, but leave
the Prudence and subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of those ancients to our
now learned men, as their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors,
if they be men of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but if they be of mindes
unfit for businesse, then as to
registers onely, and enroliers
of the ancient vertue. For to
reade history onely for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation,
in a vaine and idle
pleasure, which passeth away
without fruit: but to imitate
the vertue of those praised
men, is the true and publike
learning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:913:184"/>
I will not deny but that is
indeed a most absolute ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish'd
Soule, which is
framed both for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
and Learning
too. For then these two en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments
doe by their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
ayde, advance each other
to the skye. His high and
active policy doth governe
his learning, that it grow not
light, nor base: his learning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
doth arme that poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
that it should not onely
trust to experience and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of his owne times, but
make use of the skill and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of antiquity.</p>
            <p>But if any man, as some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
it happens, fit for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
employment, and to
ayde his Countrey, have no
felicity at all in learning, hee
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:913:185"/>
is notwithstanding to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed
of a higher order and
elegance, than hee, which is
onely capable of quiet lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
and Schoole subtilties,
unfit altogether for civill dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline,
which is most usefull.
Insomuch, as <hi>Favorinus</hi> may
bee thought, rather Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically
than jestingly, to have
measured the knowledge of
ADRIAN by the greatnesse of
his power. The Emperour
<hi>Adrian</hi> was ambitious of
the fame of learning, and
lighted by chance upon the
Philosopher <hi>Favorinus.</hi> Hee
being provoked in argument
by the Emperour, answered
sparingly, and as if hee yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
that the Emperor might
freely tryumph. His friends
blamed him for yeelding so
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:913:185"/>
soone; but hee replyed, that
they were deceived; for why
(quoth shee) should not I
thinke him the most learned,
which hath twenty Legions?
The Philosopher spake not
this without good grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: for
to governe discreetly so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Legions, was a point of
higher science, than to finde
out any thing in the Schooles
by the strongest and most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
head in Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>But the splendour of wit,
as of all things else, is often
spoyled by too great a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of it selfe. For many
conscious to their owne
weaknesse, doe endeavour by
labour to obtaine that, which
nature had denyed to them,
and by dayly diligence doe so
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:913:186"/>
mould and frame their minds,
that at last they exceil those,
which were borne happily
to great matters; but consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
too much the
strength of their owne
mindes, have abstained from
labour, as a thing not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
to them, but altogether
superfluous. There is also
a great difference even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wixt
those, who by indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
endevour to perfect their
wits.</p>
            <p>For some of them, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
they purpose as their
study and labour, are busied
onely in the maine and highest
points of it; but doe not so
much as let their thoughts
descend to the lower and lesse
necessary points. Others
are overtaken with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:913:186"/>
errour, who fearing
to leave any thing behinde
them untryed and undiscove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
doe so strictly search
into the least things, and
are so desirous perfectly to
scanne whatsoever they
learne, that they cannot
make any great Progresse
in their entended Studies,
nor ever arrive at the true
and liberall knowledge of
that thing, whose every
part they have so superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously
desired to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
            <p>Besides, all wits have not
the same strength of patience
to endure continuall la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.
For the more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
and apprehensive that
the minde is; so the more
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:913:187"/>
easily it penetrateth into any
learning; but is dulled the soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
eyther by greatnesse or
continuance of labour. For
such mindes are not kept in
thicke constitutions, but such
as are open, and fit to receive
aeriall draughts, and pervious
for the passage of animall and
vitall spirits; who as more
subtilly they can display their
sharpenesse, so by their thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
they vanish, and are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
repayred by idlenesse and
recreation. And of such
men not onely the labour, but
even the recreation is preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
as filling their discharged
mindes with a new strength,
and for the most part storing
their loose and wande<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ing
fancies with high, and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
cogitations. As the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city

of rich Fields, when
they lye untilled, doth
sometime of it owne accord

men on both sides, by true va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
or rashnesse, (two affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
of kin, though much
different) are stirred up to
the pursuit of vice or vertue.
Rashnesse hath almost the

               </gap>ame appearance and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance

doth oftentimes so farre de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that those, which make
themselves the judges of
great mens actions, doe
(which you would thinke
unjust) measure them almost
onely by the event. How
many Souldiers of the basest
ranke, because they have sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived
the dangers they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:913:190"/>
have attained the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Gracchus</hi> by the love of the

was ambitious to bee a Law-maker,
&amp; by a combination of
the Nobilitie was put to

Brother <hi>Cajus</hi> tasted; they
therefore, say some, were men
of unadvised rashnesse. <hi>Cajus
Caesar</hi> by popularity and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
winning the people, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to the Soveraigne dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
hee therefore was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
a valiant and wise
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:913:190"/>
man. King AGIS conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
against the <hi>Ephori,</hi> was
strangled at <hi>Sparta</hi> with a
base halter. CLEOMENES
boldly by the deaths of the
<hi>Ephori,</hi> did establish the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
dignity. What shall wee
censure of both their actions?
Chance, or vertue? But this
instance is an especiall one;
ALEXANDER the Great,
having quieted <hi>Asia,</hi> had
designed part of his Army to
goe, and keepe <hi>Europe</hi> in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience;
and the other
part to stay with himselfe,
least that any Commotions
might arise in the parts of
<hi>Asia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Souldiers not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon what reason the
King divided his forces, do all
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:913:191"/>
arise in a fierce mutiny; and
casting off obedience, are not
at all moved at the presence
and speech of <hi>Alexander.</hi>
But he boldly, eyther through
wrath, or policy, leapt from
his Throne amongst the mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest
of them, and with his
owne hand drew forth to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
those men, that had
most sawcily contradicted
him. That Majesty, which
could scarce preserve his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
while hee sought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pease
them, did then guard
him in the act of punishing.
This action of his by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation
of his relenting
Souldiers, was renowned for
high vertue: But GALBA
the Emperour going boldly
amongst his mutineying Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
was slaine in the midst
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:913:191"/>
of the Market place. Shall
wee call this valour or rash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse?
So neare, or almost
confused is the reason that
mixes this vertue with vice;
or, to speake more truely, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
is oftentimes forced to
take the wayes of rashnesse;
and then scarcely can it bee
vindicated from the suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of that vice, unles the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
successe make it honoured:
or hee, that was driven to
that dangerous necessity, have
by a long aestimation of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
deserved to have it
thought, that hee used not
rashly, but by the praescript
of judgementt, hose extreame
remedies which so nearely
trenched upon the vice of
rashnesse.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:913:192"/>
Therefore this affection,
when it is wary enough, is
corrupted with too fatall a
confidence in it selfe; despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
all things with too great
a scorne, and lyable to the
mischiefes of pride: apt to
boast, not carefull enough ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to avoyd hatred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>unning headlong
with a mad violence, untill
the indulgence of fortune, and
successe of rashnesse bee wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted,
and no longer able to
beare him out. But where
this affection can keepe a
meane, it growes up into
most eminent vertue, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
the courage onely in that
case, to value the dangers of
life and safety, lesse than the
infamy of forsaking their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
or betraying the cause of
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:913:192"/>
piety. But if any man with
that undaunted courage can
joyne meekenesse, and have
the power to bridle choller
(which commonly waiteth
upon the strength of those
mindes) hee is then a man
of a most excellent and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished
societie; and
beeing awfull in Peace, shall
by his ability procure a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent
feare, and by his mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
a loving respect from
all that converse with
him.</p>
            <p>There is another kinde
of adulterine boldnesse, but
more safe; which may
fall upon spirits of the basest
ranke; when they dare to
doe things, not with their
owne, but others dangers.
This, but in name onely, doth
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:913:193"/>
almost in nothing agree with
that courage which wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
before; and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
hath not beene
enough to raise undeserving
men to fame and glory. None
are more beholding to this
boldnesse, than Generals of
Armies and Physitians; one
by the danger of their Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
the other of their Patients
doe attaine fame. And indeed
how many, not onely Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,
but even Tribunes and
Centurions have not hunted
for fame by the bloud of their
Souldiers? A hard condition
of those common Souldiers,
whose praises must be all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted
by one man! Yet
the policy of men in that kind
is excusable to preserve the
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>enerals, by whose wisdome,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:913:193"/>
more than the strength of the
Souldiers, the foes are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
vanquished; and the
Souldiers upon this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are entertained, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
the Commonwealth
needes them, they are to
powre forth their Mercenary
lives. But Physitians not by
APOLLO the Father of
AESCULAPIUS, nor all
the Muses, together with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>POLLO,
can sufficiently bee
excused; those, I meane, who
hasty in acquiring of wealth
and fame, love not their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,
as the sanctity of their
calling, and mutuall affection
of humane society doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire:
but esteeme them as

               </gap>,
by a villany, which is
safe, and therefore the oftner
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:913:194"/>
practised. They use untryed
and suspicious medicines at
the perill of those, whom
they come to cure; not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
with the sure rules of
Art, and praecepts of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
but accusing antiquity,
as if they would (if they may
be trusted) invent a new art

by their deaths shall

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:913:194"/>
man; while these Physiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
doe then sinne more bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and even with the applause
of dying men. But this T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
boldnesse ariseth not
from that disposition of
minde, by which couragious
men (whether valiant or rash)
are carryed upon high un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings.
For boldnesse
or valour is not to bee ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
with a mans owne
danger; and to feare in the
behalfe of others, is huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie.</p>
            <p>Contrary to this confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and undaunted minde
is the timorous nature;
which as sometimes it
is carryed upon honesty, so
most commonly it turnes
to vice. For if it bee
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:913:195"/>
altogether joyned with sloth,
as loving security of any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
it then degenerates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the basest vices, and is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
unfit for vertue, or
for privat or publike busines.
But it is hard, unlesse onely
when dangers are at hand,
to know such cowards; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
that, knowing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap>old speeches,
challenging (as it were) all
dangers, when they see they
are farre from them; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries,
affronts, and reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
they can put up, as well
as feare. They tremble at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
show of threatning for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
nor do they strive to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
those evils, which they
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:913:195"/>
feare so much, by a valiant
and constant endeavour, but
by a dejected and ignoble
way. They esteeme the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and force of every man,
although untryed, above their
owne. They hate all men,
and yet admire them with a
secret veneration, which is
not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> against their wils,

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>pleasing to them. But,
when they may safely, they
are very cruell; eyther to
counterfeit courage, or that
their base and narrow natures
are prone to revenge, or else
to prevent their future feare
by destroying them that
might afterwards threaten
them. But their countenances
are kind, and much different
from their inward cruelty:
so that you may thinke them
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:913:196"/>
like quicke-sands, covered
with still waters, but deepe
and devouring in a storme.</p>
            <p>But especially, where a
Prince is altogether of this
timorous nature, his Servants,
and Subjects have just cause
to suspect that softnesse of
minde, which seekes indeed
to give content, but is not safe
nor happy eyther to himselfe
or others. For even those men,
that durst insult over the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiv'd
disposition of their fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Master, doe sadly at the
last suffer, in satisfaction of
contemned Majesty: and the
Prince himselfe, though hee
suspect those, whom his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
cowardlinesse makes
him feare, though hee
give them respect more than
is fitting: yet he hates those
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:913:196"/>
men, and sometimes breakes
out against them (letting
himselfe loose wholly as it
were) with a storme as sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
and violeut, as before
basely hee had yeilded to
them. But to have the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
and Subjects cowardly,
is oftentimes of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to secure the Majesty of
the Prince. But then he must
not governe them with too
gentle a hand, least they think
he feare them: nor provoke
them by too harsh and unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
commands, as altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
despising them; for a
dangerous insurrection may
be made, even of the most
cowardly men; where every
man, in so generall a mutiny,
is bold, not trusting to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
but his fellowes spirits.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:913:197"/>
But if any man be so borne
to a fearefull nature, that yet
notwithstanding by prudence
and wisedome he can acquire
true valour; and where there
is need of it, temper his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall
feares; he is not onely
farre from basenesse, but wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
of exceeding admiration,
that can change a weake pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
and most commonly bad,
into true vertue. A notable
example of feare, joyned with
these strong vertues, in our
fathers memory, was a great
and renowned Souldier, to
whom <hi>France</hi> in her Warres
did owe much. Stout he was
of hand, and wise in counsell,
yet at the very approach of
fight, when the enemies
were in sight; filled with a
representation of the danger,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:913:197"/>
his Body was so loosened, that
he needed a private place to
empty himselfe both of his
excrements, and his feare;
But when hee had recollected
his spirits, so skilfull hee was
in marshalling his Souldiers,
and so couragious in fight,
that you would doubt whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
he performed better the
office of a Chie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>etaine, or a
common Souldier. At the
end of his life also, his noble
(though calamitous) cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
proved to the world
that such a pittifull feare may
sometimes bee joyned with
true valour. For that tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
battaile of <hi>Pavy,</hi> where
King FRANCIS was taken
Prisoner, and the French lost
their hopes of <hi>Italy,</hi> was made
more sad by the death of this
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:913:198"/>
noble Captaine. The day
before this overthrow, the
King called a Councell, and,
though himselfe were eager
of fight, yet desired his offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
to give their advise. This
old man did exceedingly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
the King to stay for
supplyes, which were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
leavyed, and neare at hand:
desiring him not to throw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
hazard (especially at a time
unnecessary, and in a forreine
land) the estate and welfare
of <hi>France:</hi> that their consul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
was not onely for the
Kings honour but his safety.
There was in the Councell a
hot young man, who, of a
turbulent spirit, was fitter to
begin than continue a fight.
He alledged, that nothing was
more honourable than that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:913:198"/>
the victory (of which hee
doubted not) should bee gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by fight; that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
would receive too much
honour if they should bee fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by so great a King, and so
cheerefull an Army; that the
Kings name had already frigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them, and the <hi>French</hi>
horse would at the first onset
tread them under foote; hee
taunting besides this old Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
said, it was no marvaile
though an old man, and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
sought delayes, whose
minde was shaken with his
usuall feares, and now was see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a passage through his
guts. The old man could not
endure the scurrility of so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modest
a jest; but I (qd. he) se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the K. will have us fight,
wildy to morrow a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> honorable
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:913:199"/>
death before his face; when
thou forgetfull of thy brags
and rashnesse, shalt by abase
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>light forsake that battaile,
which now thou hastenest
on. This sad Prophesie they
both fulfilled; for the young
man fled basely from the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile;
and the other, through
noble wounds in the Kings
sight, powred out that life,
which hee before had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised.</p>
            <p>This wary and modest
feare may not onely bee joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to Prudence, but is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
a great part of it, and
very profitable in those men,
for whose too too forward
and rash spirits the Common
wealth might smart. But
those men that by this just
and wholsome Art can go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:913:199"/>
their owne mindes fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to fearefulnesse, are usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
adorned with a most
milde humanity, and full of
curtesie; and pious modesty
will injure no man; reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing
as it were, even in
the basest and poorest men, the
communion of mindes and
mortality. They are by this
inbred feare, more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
to themselves than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
For secretly within
themselves they labour by
manly precepts to compose
their sicke mindes distracted
with terrours against their
wils; but openly they neither
thinke it seemely to confesse
their timorousnesse, neyther
through the impulsions of
their unquiet feares doe they
love to manage any thing ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:913:200"/>
of their owne, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by their friends.</p>
            <p>The proud and sordid minds
are different from the bold
and fearfull; but borne as it
were, upon the borders of
them. Pride the tinder of
worst dispositions, breaketh
forth divers wayes in mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
and heynous vices, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious
to all the tortures of
hatred, love, and chiefly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy.
Perpetuall and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
are the vexations of
those men, which doe not so
much strive to gaine praise, as
thinke it is already due to
them. They easily suspect
themselves to be neglected, &amp;
revenge in themselves with
most bitter griefe, this scorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse
(as they account it) of
other men. They know not
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:913:200"/>
their owne vices, nor the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
of others. And when men
are of this h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mor, faith, piety,
and whatsoever is sacred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
men, they value below
their fame &amp; thirst of honors.
And how much soever suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
nothing breeds their qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
but carries them upon new,
&amp; more distracting hopes: but
there is no greater affliction
than when Pride fals upon a
man of a fearfull &amp; effeminate
mind. Shamefastnesse and feare
do then restraine his mad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires:
and he in the meane time
with a concealed swelling pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes
himselfe. But this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
is unfit for friendship
and every where unpleasing;
unlesse sometimes when pride
by the dull and fearfull minds
of the common people, is ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
for magnanimity. But
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:913:201"/>
But mindes that are base,
and of a sordid lownesse, as
they take no care for high at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements,
so they account
nothing unworthy to obtaine
their Lusts. They eyther sleepe
in lazy Idlenesse, and the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy
of pleasures; or else
gape after wealth with an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting
desire, that cannot
use it when they have it. With
such commotions are these
abject mindes usually trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled.
If for a time they bee
raised with high projects, and
seeme to follow reason, yet
straight they are benummed
by their naturall sottishnesse,
and wallow in their former
basenesse. Those that are
sunke in this disposition, are
not borne to beare rule: nor
yet are they very fit for obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:913:201"/>
for they repine at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
mens vertues, which
they indeed doe neyther love
nor conceive; and therefore
seeke for a kind of freedome,
in which quietly, and without
the checke of any man, they
may enjoy their owne base
and narrow affections.</p>
            <p>But we doe sometimes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
vices, and give them
the names of those vertues
which are are neare to them.
So rashnesse is honoured for
fortitude, and pride adorned
with the name of an erected
manly nature; and this base
dejected humility puts on the
colours of humanity, and that
simplicity, which is taught
by true Philosophy. But we
commonly censure no dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions
more unjustly, than
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:913:202"/>
those that are open, and apt
to doe things like rashnesse.
For upon such men, as if they
forsooke modesty, the brand
of levity is stucke: and on the
contrary, dull and close minds
doe among the people carry
an image of wisedome; wee
censure them both amisse,
but not without some shew
of reason. But open and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
wits are neyther fit for
secret malice nor deceit, nor
for the most part filled with
that malapartnesse, and other
vices, which they may seeme
to make shew of. For in
such men a desire of suddaine
speaking, and harmelesse je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting
is more praedominant,
than any malicious intent.
They scarce brooke idlenesse,
still seriously intent upon
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:913:202"/>
some action, whether great or
small; so that this kind of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
doth usually shake off
those sordid qualities, which
commonly grow upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> slothfull
minds. They ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not spare their
jests, though against a friend;
but the present delight more
than any mans wrong, is
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ought by them. They are
gentle, not onely in admitting
friendship, but continuing it;
and are not hotly led by that
pleasure, which flatters most
men (as new) in the beginn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of society or businesse.
Whatsoever they take in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,
if they do not exactly perfect
it, yet somewhat and that
pleasing, out of their own <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
they will bestow upon it;
especially since what they do,
is not wrought with anxious
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:913:203"/>
labour, but excels in the
grace of facility; as if brought
by natures owne accord to its
proper <hi>decorum.</hi> And if in
Learning they write any
thing, they offend not the
Reader with an opinion of
too much paines; for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
doe almost seeme to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the labour with those
Authors, who are knowne
not without much watching
and trouble, to force in their
sentences and words.</p>
            <p>Contrary to these disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
which are not at all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised,
but alwayes (unlesse it
very much availe them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale)
by an ingenuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
betray their actions,
are those natures, which by a
ponderous secrecy, like to
wisedome, doe hide their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:913:203"/>
and desires. To these
men many without further
tryall doe allow the name of
vertue and industry. For it is
a great shew of wisedome to
speake sparingly, and by prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script;
to bend the brow at
every mention of vice; and
to affront or injure no man,
at least openly or of set ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.
And lastly, what can
come nearer to the image of
an ample Soule, than to seeme
by a deepe and continuall
commerce to talke with wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome?
For so would you
thinke those men composed,
which are given to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named
quiet and solitude. But
this slow and grave tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
has many lurking holes,
into which it receives vices
also, whose very names hee
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:913:204"/>
cannot heare publikely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the signes of shame and
horrour (for they have ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
foreheads, and not reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
like their mindes.) That
silent and imprisoned Army of
cogitations cannot alwayes
be intent on the studies of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry
and true vertue. For as
the heats and desires of all
men decline from labour to
the sweetnesse of pleasure, so
especially theires doe, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a more soft and effaemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
nature. Hence comes it
that this often and id<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
represents uuto their
mindes all manner of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and of vices: in which
filthy contemplation they
therefore more securely rest,
because there they can f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eely
be conscious onely to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:913:204"/>
and openly, with pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
not very laborious, yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to gaine ths credulity
of others, adore vertue. But
yet doe not thinke that they
are alwayes intent in the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
eyther of wisedome
or vices; for, for the most
part, those slow mindes doe
therefore sticke, because they
finde not fit matter of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;
and in the meane
time by their countenances,
their silence, or (if thou wilt)
weightinesse (which as the
gravest of men, so the dullest
of Cattell doe expresse) they
gaine the estimation of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
and industry.</p>
            <p>There is another kind of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
which containes in it
almost al these how differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t so
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:913:205"/>
ever, with a wonderfull, but
not laudable variety. Yet a
brave disposition it were, if
nature had allowed it a bridle
as well as spurres. And that
is of men that run into the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treames
of whatsoever their
affections leade them to. If
they would bee Religious,
presently as if it were not
lawfull to interpose any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations
among those ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
duties, they put on a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
face, brooking no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission,
and a looke of such
holinesse as cannot last. They
are proud Censurers of other
mens lives, and measure all
mens honesty, by their owne
suddaine severity. Then they
shake off the pleasure of their
old friendships, and cannot
brooke innocent mirth,

which wise men mingle with
their cares, as an helpe eyther

A young youth that went
to Schoole, was by his care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Schoolemasters often ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished
to learne his book;
but the booke was hatefull to
him, that loved play and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.
A noble Lady by chance
came to that Towne, where
he lived, with two of her
daughters that were Virgins<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
and because there was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
betweene the tw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

families, this youth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
brought by way of visitation
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:913:210"/>
to the Ladies lodging. Hee
began immediately to admire
one of the young Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
then to hold discourse
with her, and in conclusion, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
the same day, to fall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely
in love with her.
Then first his simple and free
minde began to be enthralled
with cares. The next day he
goes again to the place, where
he received his unfelt wound,
and by prolonged discourses,
so fed his malady, that hee
grew worse and worse. For
on the third day the Ladie
with all her company going
out of Towne, left this youth
scarce a living <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oule. And he,
poore wretch (obbed even of
that ease) was forced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceale
his flame for feare of
being chid by his Father, or
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:913:210"/>
mocked by his fellowes. After
long consultation within
himselfe, he judged no course
better for him, than wholly
to apply himselfe to his
booke; for so he thought he
might gaine his Father, and
in recompence of so great a
diligence in study obtaine
from him a time of recreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
And as a reward of his
labour, he had resolved to get
leave of his Father, to goe to
a faire City not fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re from
thence; and that was it in
which the Mayd dwelt. His
Schoolemasters and fellowes
began to admire his excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
diligence; and often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
from whence so great a
change of mind should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
and love to learning in
that youth, who not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:913:211"/>
disdained the very name
of it. For in the morning he
would rise to his booke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his fellowes, and was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
bid, before he would goe
to play. The heat of his love,
which caused this diligence,
did make both his labour so
easie to him, and the Muses so
sweet, that, before he was
aware, he was taken with a
love of them. Afterward (as
in that age it often happens)
when long absence had made
him forget the young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman
and his hot love, an
eager desire of learning did
still remaine in him. And he
following the liberall study,
came to so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>igh a proficiency
in learning, that all the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
are much indebted to
him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:913:211"/>
But Love a stubborne ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady,
and not to be cured with
that facility, that other affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
are, unlesse it be stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
in the first motion, is
hardly removed by any means
but length of time; that so
wearied it may expire. For
while he is in his course, hee
findes somewhat alwayes to
encrease, and advance the
power he holds. For if the
Lover through all his griefes
and melancholly thoughts
have but arrived at some suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse;
he would thinke him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe
too cruell to himselfe, to
banish utterly so sweet a
delight from him. But if a
more cruell fortune doe either
too long differ his hopes, or
altogether take them away;
then also his g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iefe pleases

him, and the minde pitty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it selfe, and with sighs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volving
the cause of his cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
melts in the pleasure of
so delicate a sadnesse. But
that Love which is hid, is
most lasting; eyther where
both the parties are secretly
agreed; the very sweetnesse
of the secrecy doth then
please them; or where the
Love is not mutuall, and one
onely suffers, who with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy
endures his wound. Nor
doth the violence of this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
grow onely betweene
the different sexes; for SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRATES
loved ALCIBIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DES,
and LYCURGUS thought
it no ill discipline to ordaine
that every youth should have
his lover. The chastity of
nature leading men to just
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:913:212"/>
and brave Loves, lookes not
at all at that difference; and
you shall see many of the most
honest men tormented with a
care (or to call it right) a
love of some young men. And
this love is a certaine tye of
benevolence, more hot and
violent than to bee called
friendship. We have then a
perpetual desire of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
them; continuall wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes
for their safety and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;
feare for the successe of
whatsoever they doe; and
thinke alwayes that fortune,
how lavish soever she bee in
her favours towards them,
doth not recompence their
deserts. That also is a fierce
and restlesse desire, which
strives for unchaste ends to
win a beauty of the different
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:913:213"/>
sexe. But yet thinke not but
that examples of most pure
chastity may continue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
different sexes; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the thing so full of
danger, doe oftentimes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
them; and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
by little and little (ere
they bee aware, or against
their wils) doe loue other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they eyther thought
or wish'd to doe.</p>
            <p>But the minde of that man,
whom Nature moulded for a
lover, is milde, expressing in
the very countenance mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty,
and simple vertue; of a
great but mercifull spirit; not

exceeding paenitent
when he himselfe offends; a

impatient of idlenesse
and all occasions of sloth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse

disposition will often make it

the Dispositions of

and againe betweene those
Kings, who come to their
Crownes by right of Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
and by Election. Of
the dispositions of Noblemen
gracious with Kings.</head>
            <p>THose people, who sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
themselves to no
Scepter, though they abhorre
the name of servitude, yet doe
not enjoy true liberty. For
they must needs elect Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates,
to whom they give iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
over themselves;
and the publike power, which
they glory to be in the whole
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:913:219"/>
Nations, is adored in a few
men; so that in those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
where you would think
all did reigne, the greatest
part are Servants; a secret
law of things dispensing so
the frame and order of the
world, that by the nerves of
one head (according to the
rule of the Deity) many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
should bee governed.
This spirit of Government,
which loves to reside in a few
doth more plainely shew it
selfe in the Aristocracy, but
most of all in a Monarchy,
where all the power is in one.
But that height of power, to
which GOD by a secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
has subjected Men, was
not ordained for their sakes,
which possesse the dignity,
but those that are subject to it.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:913:219"/>
Therefore when Kings have
abused their dignity accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
as their pleasures and
ambition swayed them; or
the peoples ignorance hath
not understood their owne
co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>modity, the name of Kings
hath oftentimes grown hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
and Monarchy with much
blood and slaughter hath been
banished out of many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
and againe restored.</p>
            <p>All those Common-wealths
that flourished heretofore,
had Kings at the first. But they
being expelled by those that
understood not true liberty,
eyther the blind popular go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernement
succeeded them,
or else the rule of the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
that is, many Kings in
stead of one. And as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
which by violence is put
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:913:220"/>
out of joynt, cannot be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
joynt but by violence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine;
so those Provinces,
which by this meanes had
cast off the best forme of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
could not againe,
untill they had cruelly payed
for that errour, bee restored,
&amp; reduced to their first right
estate. For in those Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon-wealths,
some cittizens swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
with ambition, had ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by armes made their
names great, or by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
error engrossed too great
and too little offices; or else
had seized into their owne
hands the strength of the
Common-wealth, and called
themselves Kings. But they
growing fierce (as it must
needs bee in a new and hated
State) did so pollute their
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:913:220"/>
reignes, which they by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
had gotten, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
for their sakes thought
worse of Kings than ever
they had done, and the name
Tyrant, which was once an
honour to all Monarchs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a word of hatred, and
publike infamie.</p>
            <p>But hee, that will consider
those affections, which Kings
by the greatnesse of their dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
doe nourish in them,
must not esteeme alike the
state of all Kings. Those dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
wayes that bring them
to their height, doe cause dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
mindes in them: and
those that reigne in a new-setled
Monarchy, doe carry
themselves in another man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
than those who safely,
and by the peoples wishes
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:913:221"/>
reigne over a Nation long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>customed
to that governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And different also are
the minds of a King crowned
by Election (as in <hi>Hungary,
Denmarke,</hi> and the Roman
Empire) and such a King as
reigneth by inheritance, and
possesseth that state which his
Father, and Grandsires held
before him. New kingdoms
not well established by time
nor the constancy of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
doe fill their Princes with
continuall suspicions. They
flatter the meanest subjects,
and feare the Nobility, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
whilest they thinke
themselves are feared; and
daily consider with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
that their estate, not
yet setled, may by the motion
of fortune as easily be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:913:221"/>
as it was raised. Nor
are tyrants onely, that came
unjustly to their crownes, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted
with these thoughts:
but those also, who are law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
chosen over such Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as have not beene accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomed
to the name and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
of a King. But this
feare is greater in Tyrants.
For if they have subjected a
Common-wealth, they feare
the Nobility, as men that
will vindicate their lost liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and loath to serve him who
lately was their equall: Or if
they have invaded a Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy,
and expelled the true
heyres; with a continuall care
and vexation they suspect and
feare the peoples hearts, as
inclining to their ancient
Lords. Therefore they dare
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:913:222"/>
not trust their friends, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
being privy to their
counsels, they know also the
means which way their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
may be undermined;
and expect fidelity from no
man, since themselves have
violated it. But in open show,
and with a garbe put on of set
purpose, they seeke occasions
of doing curtesies, and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiously
affect the fame of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity,
and loue to their
Countrey. They are excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
liberall to the poore;
great punishers of those vices,
of which themselves gave ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,
and lastly eyther Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
or restorers of the best
Lawes, and publike buildings
for ornament of the Citty; to
decline by those meanes the
present envy, and infamy of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:913:222"/>
posterity.</p>
            <p>In this manner a Tyrant is
eyther bad by the fault of his
condition, not his dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or else is good by neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity.
His minde is wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
austere, his countenance
wilde, his thoughts ready up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
all occasions, especially
those occasions which he
feares; true pleasure he doth
not know, but is led with a
hope of it; and with vaine
pompe sweetning his inward
cruell cares, he doth as it were
cousen his owne minde. But
a lawfull King eyther by ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
or inheritance, confident
in the right of his royalty,
doth not so descend to base
feares, or wicked preventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
although perchance hee
fall upon turbulent times,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:913:223"/>
mad Subjects, and whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
else a Tyrant feareth. But
those Princes, which owe
their fortune to election,
whose royalty continues not
in their family, being as it
were, private men in one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
namely as they consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their posterity, doe sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
with their whole care
and endeavour so much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
the publike good, as those
Princes which receiving the
Kingdome from their Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours,
strive to adorne it for
their owne Posterity. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
those cares which are
due to the publicke, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow
upon their domesticke
affaires, in a piety which may
be excused, if they can fitly
divide their thoughts, and
looke both wayes, so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:913:223"/>
their family, that
they forget not their publike
charge. But if by chance
they hope or desire top referre
any of their owne bloud to
the succession, then by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
and curtesie the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples

Servant even to those men,
by whom in publike hee
is served and adored. In such
cares oftentimes for their
private family, is the indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
of those men taken up,
who for their Heroicall
vertues, did before seeme
worthy to weare a Crowne.</p>
            <p>Many times they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to the worse part,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:913:224"/>
corrupting their manners, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising
with revenge their
ancient hatreds and aemulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons:
when not forgetting
who were before at dissention
with them, or who were
crosse in voyces to their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
their new power, not
yet able to governe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
it selfe, doth swell one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
with desire of revenge.</p>
            <p>But if they be troubled
with none of these mischiefs,
yet for the most part they are
ambitious to doe strange and
wonderfull things, and by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to renowne themselves and
their times to Posterity. These
high desire<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> may aswell be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient
as profitable to
the Common-wealth. For as
in Apples and Berries too
early and forced ripenesse is
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:913:224"/>
onely pleasant because of the
novelty of it; but the Trees
themselves by such forced ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuring,
and unseasonable
heats, after this fruit is
brought forth, doe presently
decay: so in publike affaires,
especially the greatest, acer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
order is to be observed;
and those who pervert or
praecipitate those affaires, doe
seeme as it were to kill the
Commonwealth. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
elected Kings,
almost in all ages, burning
with desire of a lasting fame,
have eyther raised Warres a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
or sought to innovate
something in their owne
Realmes; to gaine a name by
their owne boldnesse and the
danger of their men; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
valuing it at that rate.

his disposition; I will make
the world (quoth he) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
how much a King cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen

            <p>But those Kings to whom

children that perpetuated ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
which they received fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

search out this disposition of
theirs, that oweth it selfe only
to God, may perchance be too
sacrilegious a wisedome. Nor
is it lawfull for us to pry into
those affections, which the

               </gap>ious
may perchance enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it were better for Kings
to begin their reignes in their
childhoood, so accustomed to
that greatnesse, as a thing
borne with them, than to
grow up under the reigne of
their Fathers or kinsmen, and
afterward receive their great
inheritance; whether a quiet
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:913:226"/>
and obedient people doe sof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and spoyle a Princes dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,
while his power has a
free swindge; or rather that
love of the Subjects doe not
endeare the Prince his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to them, as the master of
a family to dutifull Servants.
Lastly, if a lawfull Prince, by
the peoples ill affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
him, be forced to fight
for his owne right, whether
after the victory he will reign
cruelly, showing an hatred
and contempt of them; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
strive to appease them
by a mutual respect, as remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring
the past dangers to bee
such, as may returne more
heavily upon him. Arguments
and examples are not wanting
on both sides, (which in the
changes of humane affaires,)
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:913:226"/>
although proceeding from
the same causes, have not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
found the same e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents.</p>
            <p>But it is in vaine to search
into these decrees of heaven;
let the Kingly height not bee
touched with curious cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
but pryed into onely
with adoration, as the secret
mysteries of religion were: for
it is piety to wish for good
Princes, but to condemne bad
ones is unlawfull. And seeing
moreover that they doe not
so much governe themselves,
as give way to the fates lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
(who by their affections
doe ordaine the declinations
and growth of States) all art
and wisedome, that lookes
into their <hi>Genius,</hi> and conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
of it, is oft deceived.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:913:227"/>
The first step from this
great height is the condition
of Noblemen. Eyther thoser
whom Kings chuse for Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sellours,
to share with them
the cares of the Common-wealth;
or those who by a
great and entire ty of love are
endeared to their Kings.
Through both these, as
through the mouths of rivers
which discharge themselves
into a great Sea, are the desires
and hopes of the people ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But they, as being advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
for different respects,
have different wayes and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions.
Those therefore
who by their flower of age, or
high birth, or sweetnesse of
behaviour, are highly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
in Princes Favours, have
for the most part mindes bent
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:913:227"/>
to please; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> although deny'd
to their owne affections, they
square according to the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of their Lord. This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a wonderfull kind of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude,
and full of subtill art;
hiding sometimes a base and
abject minde, sometimes a free
and bold di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>position. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to follow pleasure, to
sport or jest well, is as usefull
to them as the greatest la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour;
Nay even to exercise
a kinde of state over their
Princes, and almost reigne
(but not too long and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly)
doth more kindle the
Princes affections to them,
who desire as well to be belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
as to love. For Lords
that are advanced to that
slippery height of favour, if
they know their Prince to be
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:913:228"/>
of a soft nature, not brooking
enough a continuall use of the
same pleasures, must sparing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
bestow their pleasing
lookes, or jests, or whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
in them is delightfull to
him; dispensing them in so
prudent a manner, that affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
stirred up often and by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termissions,
may neither breed
a loathing, nor by neglect and
oblivion be blotted out. But
if the Prince be easie and apt
to change often his affections
and Favorites, but wheresoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he apply him elfe, his
love as it is short, so is it blind
and vehement; The Favorites
reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bring that they are now
in a high tide, but shall short<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
returne to their owne Sea,
doe make most greedy use of
their felicity. For they are
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:913:228"/>
not afraid by importune suites
to weary this affection of the
Prince, which unlesse it bee
timely taken and made use of,
like wines, which last not,
it decayes and perishes of it
selfe.</p>
            <p>But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>arre different wayes
are to be taken with those
Princes, who lose not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in a torrent of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
but to that sweetnesse of
nature, which makes them
love, doe joyne reason also.
For this affection, being true
indeed, and perpetuall (if they
deserve it) as it can never do
all things, so has alwayes po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to doe something. Nor
must you rob altogether that
tree, but gather with choyse
the fruit of it, which will
grow againe for you. There
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:913:229"/>
fore the Favourites of such
Princes, doe wholly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>apply
themselves to them; and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
forgetting their Majesty,
doe alwayes in their love give
due observance, modestly use
their freedome of speaking
or advising, and ofter consider
that they are Princes, than
that themselves are Favorites.
Those Favorites as it is their
first care, to hold up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in that height of grace,
so alwayes make it their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
endeavour to raise E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states,
to get Offices and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
that if they doe
remove from that height of
favour, yet they may still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
some happy monument
of their former power, and a
stay to their after-life. But
those, who forgetting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:913:229"/>
and too much trusting
to their fortune, in prodigall
ryot doe consume all the
wealth and revenew of that
rich favour, are worthy of a
poore old age, and then in
vaine to repent themselves of
their unseasonable and ill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
so high a part.</p>
            <p>Those Favorites also must
use one caution, which, if
they neglect it, doth some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ruine them; not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
themselves before their
Prince in any thing in which
he eyther desires to excell, or
thinks hedoth. If he love the
fame of policy, eloquence, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
of the art of warre or
hunting; let him yeeld, that
knowes himselfe to excell at
it; for feare the Prince should
be fired with an emulation,
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:913:230"/>
that may not onely extinguish
the favour, but draw on a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell
and heavy displeasure. For
many times the Princes mind
(with an ambition not small,
but more than the thing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves)
is desirous of fame in
such matters, and takes it hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
to lose the prize. There
is no certainer way for those
Lords to gaine their Princes
affections, than to seeme ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers
of them; but it must be
done with art, and so as may
gaine beleife, for all do not lie
open to the same flatter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Prince who eyther is co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious
of vertue in himselfe, or
swelled with vaine credulity,
either may be or loves to bee
deceiued by those arts; so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men striving to please and
praise the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do quite overcome
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:913:230"/>
their modesty, and make them
beleive great matters of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.
Another great art of
gaining their favor is to seem
to love them, some <hi>Venus</hi> (as it
were) insinuating an officious
grace, and requi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing from the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
a requitall of affection. That
man i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> yet alive, and enjoyes
the height of his fortune, who
by such a happy accident en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
the love and favour
which his master began to
beare him. The King by chance
with a fal from his horse brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his side, fell into a Fever;
this Lord with a sad &amp; astoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed
countenance watched all
night without sleepe by his
masters side. Whether it were
art or piety, he so far wrought
upon the K. affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that none
was afterward in greater grace
with him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="tcp:913:231"/>
Nor can we say that the
disposing of so great a felicity
(which fome few onely can
enjoy, having so many rivals
in compassing that happy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour)
is onely in the hands
of Fortune. For as Fortune a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
doth bring some men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Kings favours; so many of
them for want of art and wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
doe fall againe from
that height; so that it may be
sayd to be in Fortunes power,
sometimes to raise men to it;
but of prudence to keepe
them in it. But it is therefore
a more fearefull thing to fall
from that happinesse, because
having beene once admitted
into the Sacrament of so high
a friendship, they can hardly
fall from it, but they fall into
hatred, or at least a kinde of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:913:231"/>
loathing; for love doth not so
often use to dye of it selfe, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
to be killed by a contrary af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
            <p>But those Noblemen, by
whose hands Princes doe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage
the greatest affaires of
their Kingdomes, to whom
they trust their secret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,
and the ordering of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine
and domesticke affaires,
doe commonly temper the
strength of their dignity after
another way; as namely so to
draw all the deepest and grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
cares of the realme into
their owne hands, and so to
appropriate them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
that they stand not in
so much need of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
as their Country does of
their Service. And this they
attaine by a perpetuall dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:913:232"/>
in those affaires, and
removing, as farre they can,
not onely others, but even the
King himselfe from the
knowledge of them. For they
may safely manage all things
when the Prince is plunged
either in ignorance of his
owne businesse, or credulitie
toward them. But these men
being ignorant of their owne
fame, doe as seldome almost
heare the truth as Kings
themselves. For although
they be infamous for extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or pride, or any other wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse,
and so generally spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
of by the common voice,
yet themselves many times
know nothing of it, untill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
overwhelmed with the
weight of them, they begin at
the same time to feele the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:913:232"/>
and punishment too.
Their countenances for the
most part are composed of
gravity; accesse to them is not
easie; therefore discourses are
short, shewing much busines,
and a kinde of Majesty. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
these there are some,
few, whose lookes are ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
confused with businesse,
nor swelled with pride. These
are worthy of high praise in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed;
nor are the other to
be condemned, who fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
their manners according
to their dignity and fortunes.
For this high Majesty, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
the vulgars pitch, is
sometimes necessary, in those
men, by whose hands Kings
doe manage their greatest af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires:
especially seing the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
of accesse &amp; conference
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:913:233"/>
begets a reverence toward
them; whereby the minds of
common people are bridled;
for the people commonly doe
eyther feare or contemne. But
that asperity of a strict coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
whether it bee dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine,
or a true valuation of
their power, may well bee
forgiven in them, who for a
reward of all their weighty
cares, have this especially, as a
token of honour and respect.
Besides being worne, as tt
were, with continuall trouble
and businesse, they cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
put on the same coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances,
or looke with a
cleare, and unchanged vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage.</p>
            <p>But if that power, and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
to helpe or deceive, doe
fall upon impious minds, who
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:913:233"/>
intent wholly upon their
owne profit, neglect the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
safety: then although in
their wickednesse they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit
vertue never so subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
(as if neglecting their own
domesticke affaires, they were
carefull onely for their Prince
and Countrey;) they turne
notwithstanding all their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses
that way, which tends
to the preservation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of their owne dignity.
If they can helpe themselves
while the Kings estate is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled:
while with all diligence
they seeme to cleare it, they
doe but involve it into moe
difficulties, and throw it into
darke perplexities. But if in a
quiet kingdome they can
more securely reigne, then of
necessity they hate all com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>motions,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:913:234"/>
and will rather suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
the peace of their times to
continue, though growing in
the seedes of all evill, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
to the ruine of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.
Lastly, the same desires,
which possesse elected Kings,
doe commonly feed these
Statesmen: both of them hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
a suddaine transitory po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
which is not at all to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend
upon their posterity.</p>
            <p>Who therefore can chuse
but admire those men, which
in so great a place can keepe
integrity, and remember
true vertue, when it lyes
in their power to offend with
so much ease, and so much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage?
Some such in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
age, to the releife of
Mankinde, have come upon
the stage, men severe to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:913:234"/>
of a white &amp; innocent
honour, ambitious of nothing
but the publike good. But
the goodnesse of these men
many times cannot keepe
them safe from envy. For by
the very slipperinesse of their
dignity (upon which few
are strong enough to stand)
and the vices of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes,
their vertue often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
is wronged; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting
tongues will never
leave those eminent places,
in which they may find mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of railing, sometimes
justly, but never without sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition.</p>
            <p>But glorious is the fruit of
such a dignity: that beeing
safe, and out of theyr
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>each, they see the envy
of other men against them;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:913:235"/>
and those men forced to give
them respect, whom they
know maliciously bent, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
their aemulation, and stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to expresse love. For
such envy joyned with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
and stirred up onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
felicity, doth yeild (I
know not in what sense) a
kinde of ambitious pleasure to
those men, against whom it
rises, as putting them in mind
of their owne greatnesse, and
the basenesse of other men.</p>
            <p>But they have another, and
farre more excellent preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in governing the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,
that can lend a
helping hand to brave and
vertuous men, whom poverty
or some other calamity doth
keepe downe, and be ready, as
it were, to ayde distressed
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:913:235"/>
nature. Which thing as it
becommeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to performe,
so can they not leave it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
without suffering of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment
in themselves for it,
as secretly chidden by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
of good men, and
upbraided by the image of
vertue daily complaining
within them: For seeing they
did deserve to be advanced for
this very reason, because they
either are or seeme to be men
of the ancient and prudent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry;
Why should not they
acknowledge men of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
quality, and dearely
love those that are of kindred
with their owne dispositions?
Nor are they ignorant which
they be, or where they may
be found. For as all other li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
creatures, unlesse they be
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:913:236"/>
starke blinde, can see and
know those that are of their
owne kinde: so these men
being of so cleare a sight, of
so eminent and full a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
cannot chuse but finde
out, without mistaking, men
that are of kindred to their
owne excellencies. And let
them not say that they are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
with the multitude of
such natures, and that neither
themselves nor the Common-wealth
are sufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
for all of them; it were
well with Mankind, if there
were so great a plenty of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
soules, that, when all
publike affaires were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to them, some would bee
still left, bestowed by God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the world, as it were, for
no action or employment. But
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:913:236"/>
Mankind is not happy in such
a plenty; and it was rare in all
ages, and among all Nations to
find a deepe and pure wit, fit
to be employed in any kind of
civility, one adorned with
learning, and borne with a
cleare and valiant modesty, to
dare all things, but nothing
too much. When great men
invite such dispositions to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
with them in the publike
felicity, they doe first honour
themselves, as of kindred to
that <hi>Genius;</hi> and secondly adde
strength to the common-wealth,
which is never better
governed than by wise me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. As
the fame of all eminent arts is
stained by the multitude of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers,
&amp; the unskilfulnesse of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, most of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being unable
to doe what they promise, &amp;
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:913:237"/>
seeking for their commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
onely the vaine name
of such an art: so the fame of
wisedome and science hath
beene oft stained by unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
men, who have studyed
nothing lesse than the Muses,
or true Prudence. But it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes
great men to keepe
downe that counterfeit and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterate
vertue; and advance
true industry, vindicated from
the praejudice of unskilfull
men, to such rewards as, of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice,
are due to it.</p>

            <p>BEsides these two sorts of
great men, befriended by
Fortune, there are in Kings
Courts a great multitude of
men of all births, noble and
upstart, of all estates and ages,
who there seeke after wealth,
fame, and favour. And these
houses of Princes, though to
the outward show they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
as places composed to
all jollity and pleasure, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
filled with revels, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:913:238"/>
(for a change of recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
sweating with hunting
games; full of honours, glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
in pompous and gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous
attire, and rich ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quettings;
where every man
seemes to live in a garbe of
magnificence, and jollity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
his condition: Yet to
him that lookes more nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly
into the nature of it,
they will appeare in manner
of Faires or Markets, where
men doe exercise a most labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
kinde of traffique. How
many arts, how many trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
belong to a Court life,
scarce they themselves can tell
you, who have that way suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
along time for their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.
Nor does any man in
this Sea deserve the haven, but
he that understands that a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

care and labor belongs
to him to turne even those
things, which in such a life
seeme to flatter a man with
soft showes of pleasure into
severe uses; and alwayes in
those very delights, find out
matter of care and industry.
For as the hardest labors may
grow into a delight (as when
immoderate hunting; or too
watchfull studies are pleasing
to a strong and uncurbed
minde:) so all kindes of
sport may by a severe inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
bee so tempered, that
they may turne to the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
of a true labour. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

which are found in
the Court jollity, doe no way

            <p>Wouldst thou know there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

or barbarous precepts.
If they be of such a condition,
age, and person, as they may
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:913:239"/>
hope to thrive by these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
and Court sports, then ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificially
they mould them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to that magnificence,
and pursue the fame of Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;
and especially turne
their garbe to that kinde of
jollity, which is most plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to the Prince. But ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is it good for them with
the wast of their Patrimonies
to buy the miseries of along
hope: nor to let these loose
and pleasant-seeming baites
mollify and corrupt their
mindes; thinking dally with
themselves, that they are now
at the hunting, not the prey.
But others which are not by
the same fortune invited to
these showes of delight (as
unfit for them in condition or
disposition) suffer not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:913:240"/>
to be deceived with
that errour which the other
unwary Gallants are, as to
thinke that a man cannot be a
brave fellow, or accounted a
Courtier, unlesse he be emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
for extreame boldnesse,
and all expressions of wanton
jollity. They know that inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
vertue can there open
to them other wayes, &amp; more
secure, to wealth and honour.
And that Princes doe more
certainely esteeme and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
a man, that understands
his owne condition and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi>
and followes that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any disguise or vain pride,
than such men, as ambitiously
counterfeit and put on a grab,
which fortune hath denyed to
their persons and conditions.
This moderation doe those
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:913:240"/>
wise men keepe, who come
to such Court-baites, as to an
art, to make use of them ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than enjoy them; but let
them, whom Fortune has not
condemned to soluxurious a
charge, taste these delights in
sober pleasure, and as a recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
onely to their greater
cares. And rather as Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
then to be themselves a
part of the Scene; Lastly those
who possesse fortunes eyther
by their owne industry, or
their ancestors, may bee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to follow those plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and recreations, as sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

            <p>Nor is it wonder if those
men be unfit for great matters
whom sluggish Luxury, that
look'd no farther than it selfe,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:913:241"/>
has as it were bewitched;
since a watchfull diligence
letting passe no occasion, is
not more required in any
kinde of life, than that of a
Courtier. For as trees grow
from little seeds, and a man
may stride over the fountaine
of greatest rivers: so in Court
greatest felicity hath sprung
from very small beginning<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>,

            <p>METELLA obtayned the
marriage of DICTATOR SYL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LA
by this accident; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
into the Theater, and
lightly laying her hand on his
shoulder as he sate, she sayd,
she desired to partake of his
fortune. MARIUS in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:913:241"/>
poverty received his
first encouragement from an
accidental speech of SCIPIO,
as prophetically pointing him
out to the height of warre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
honour. For he knew how
the hearers of this speech
might be kept in this praeju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,
and the greatnesse of
his growing fame fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thence
made up. So sometimes by
a little and light blast wee are
put in minde of a commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
winde, which if we fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
will carry our vessell to
such fortunes as were above
our hopes, and almost above
envy. It has raised some only
to light upon a great man,
when he was pleasant and
free, and open to any acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
which fortune brought
him: some by a seasonable
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:913:242"/>
and happy sentence or jest:
some by a suddaine token ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed
by chance of spirit or
industry, some by a casuall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation
of one, who aymed
not at that when he spoke,
have been strangely furthered
in the way of advancement.</p>
            <p>There is therefore in men
that are worthy to follow the
Court with fortune, no rash
soule, nor impatie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of lingring
and manifold hopes, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed,
and alwayes looking
upon Fortune, and curious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to find out whatsoever
she, though implicitly, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise
to him. Nor do they wait
idly untill those seedes of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity
do of their own accords,
fall upon them. But by great
arts they further Fortunes
good meaning to the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; of which
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:913:242"/>
the chiefest are to have friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with many, but with
still observance, to keepe the
favour of one of those which
are of the nearest familiarity
with the Prince. For that way
of rising is not so open to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
and besides, the Kings
friends, more than the King
himselfe, doe ofte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bestow the
wealth of the Kingdome. Let
that Nobleman be such a one,
as can prefer his friends with
publike benefits; for great no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen

their wealth, nor, if they would
can those rivers afford such
stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g tides, as a P. his sea ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> do.</p>
            <p>Nor must they weary the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of that Noblema<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
and unprofitable suites; lest
the very sight of them grow

alwayes a fresh trouble;
or else least spending his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
in small matters, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
much indebted to him
(as ever granting their suites)
but little to fortune. In Fables
we see that point of wisdome
expressed. NEPTUNE granted
to his sonne THESEUS th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ee
wishes, and confirmed by a
great oath that he should ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
them. THESEUS having
twice tryed the Gods fidelity,
when now his last wish re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained,
he was so loath to
throw away that certaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit,
which he could never
call backe againe, that at the
time of his imprisonment in
Hell, when B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ared (as if there were
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:913:243"/>
somewhat beyond death) to
redeeme his safety at so great
a price.</p>
            <p>There is in Court another
labour of eminent profit; to
be able to turne thy nimble
and active minde severall
wayes, and to put on, at least
in shew, any motion or garbe
that may be pleasing; which
scarce any man can fitly doe,
without strong and austere di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
and a great command
over his owne desires. By this
art have many men gotten
both estates and honours, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in free Commonwealths,
in which so many Lords can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
bee all pleased with one
vertue or one vice; or in Kings
Courts, where you must not
onely fashion your studies to
the Princes owne honour, but
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:913:244"/>
must court all that are in
grace with him; who being
oft of various dispositions
must bee wonne by different
kinds of service.</p>
            <p>These and the like studies of
anxious dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce do they take
who follow the Court upon
right hopes, and praecepts of
true Prudence: but these things
are either not discerned, or
else despised by the more tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
blinded young Courtiers; who
oftentimes unworthy of their
parents carefull paines, fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their wealthy mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
in a luxurius (&amp; afterwards
needy) ambition. It is enough
for them to be named Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
&amp; numbred among men of
honor; it may be, because it is
the first liberty that they taste
after they are freed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:913:244"/>
of their Schoolema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters;

to draw these novices into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>shment.
But if they chance
to receive the least grace in
countenance or words fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the
Prince himself, they are scaarce
able to beare so proud a joy;
but with ravished eyes loo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
about them to see who are by,
to witnesse this great honor.
But especially they seeke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the fame of revelling and
wanton Courtship, as a note
of Nobility and manly vertue;
nor doe they moderate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
according to their own
estates, but to the expences of
great men; so emulating the
course of those that are above
them, and not able to keepe
pace with them, they run the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
out of breath, and faint.
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:913:245"/>
From hence they grow hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily
in debt, and complaine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the Prince, where them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
are in fault; as if the
Prince could infuse wisdom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>

his sacred treasury, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
that, the Common-wealth
should suffer for the
profuse madnesse of these
wanton fooles.</p>
            <p>There, are not onely in
Courts, but in all kindes of
life, different dispositions of
rich and poore men. I call not
onely those poore men, who
are in extreame want, and
driven to take miserable care
for meat and cloathes, but
those al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o which want estates
to support them in that state
of li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, which they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken;
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>om which they

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>end but by a sad
confession of poverty. Some
poore men doe openly vent
their griefe; and had rather
complaine of the wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of their condition, than
excuse or conceale it. So to
the great ease of their cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
they can openly childe
Fortune, and avoyd a greater
trouble than poverty, which
is, to counterfeit wealth. By
this meanes they can inure
themselves to beare their mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune,
and by professed la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
seeke a remedy against
that greefe, which they doe
not hide. Men become of this
nature, either by their low
birth, which keepes them
from blushing at poverty; or
else (which is almost a vice)
they are so subdued and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:913:246"/>
by Fortunes lashes, that
they dare breathe no higher;
or lastly by a brave and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable
contempt of transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
things, di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>daining to
professe that condition, in
which the fates have placed
them; able to manage great
fortunes, and in poore estates
not deje<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ted.</p>
            <p>There is another kinde of
poore men, who with an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate
and <hi>Spartan</hi> patience
can endure all the strokes of
fortune. They with a merry-seeming
countenance, do hide
the anxiety of their ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e-di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
mindes, and thinke
themselves happy enough, if
they can seeme so to others.
So in an obstinate conceale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of their miseries, they
suffer inwardly for that
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:913:246"/>
shamefastnesse, being ever so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous
about their publike
fame, and moreover the talke
of their houshold Servants,
who must both know, and
sometimes feele those wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds.
As many of those poore men
as doe see helpe at hand, and
neare to them upon certainty
(which is enough to make ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
stiffely endure a siedge) &amp;
have for a while with fained
cheerfulnesse hid their pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
doe not onely deserve not
to be accused of pride, but to
be accounted brave men, and
worthy to be speedily rescued
by prospe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ity. But those men,
w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> in their poverty, do suffer
that perpetuall vexatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any expectatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of fortunes
redresse (at least not hopefull)
yet wil so order their affaires,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:913:247"/>
as in midst of perpetuall do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mesticke
miseries, they will
put on this maske of wealth;
they are altogether worthy of
pity, and may without envy
enjoy that ambition, which
with so many cares and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities
they have purchased.
There are lastly some, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
whom wealth, like
suddaine gushes of water,
doth passe and spend it selfe
in a magnificence too high
for it. Their mindes doe suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
a wonderfull punishment,
and worthy of their madnesse;
nor is there a greater or worse
madnesse, than, not to decline,
by a mature confession of thy
fortunes, a certaine ruine;
and whilest by a charge that
cannot last, thou wouldst have
the people thinke thy estate
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:913:247"/>
great; thou makest it so
small that it can never after
stand in any mediocrity. This
is especially the fault of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen
and young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
that come newly to
their inheritances, who are of
an haughty disposition, not
knowing frugality, but by a
profusion of wealth seeking
a fame higher than their owne
estates, or the fortune of their
ancestours. Their mindes
are troubled with long mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and fall oftentimes from
that greatnesse, which they
seeme to carry; for there is
scarce any humility, nor often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
plaine fraud, but they
will secretly descend to it, to
get money, which afterwards
publikely, as it were in a
whirlewinde of inconsiderate
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:913:248"/>
rashnesse, they may pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ely
throw away. There is nothing
more dangerous than to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
any publike office to such
dispositins, who by any
meanes strive to respite that
Poverty, with an anxious
feare, but such an one as is not
paenitent, they daily and just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
expect.</p>
            <p>There are also as many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versities
in the condition of
rich men as of poote. Some
are born to estates left by their
ancestors. Other men by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
do get wealth, &amp; learne
by little and little to be fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate.
Both of these are neither
transported with admi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation
of themselves, nor with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode
are exultation, long cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
having almost destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the sense of daily joy which
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:913:248"/>
is never excessive, when by
deg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ees <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and expires.
But there are some, who by a
suddaine torrent of Fortune
are overwhelmed, and at one
race doe run as it were from
Earth to Heaven. And these
men, by such an unusuall
sweetnesse are transported to
a forgetfulnesse of themselves
and a most proud contempt of
that condition, from whence
they are now translated.
There happened lately a fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
example for us to behold a

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with suddain
prosperity, and worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
because by the view of
one picture we may conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
of other faces.</p>
            <p>There were two youths,
who by education at the same
Schooles, were endeared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:913:249"/>
in a neare tie of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
The name of the one
was MELLA, the name of the
other CAEPIO, in who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
the Schoole was, and this
beginning of their love. The
time passing away which that
age doth spend at Schoole,
<hi>Mella</hi> teturned into his
owne Countrey; But first
with <hi>Capi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> he entered into a
deare league of everlasting
friendship; nor was this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
in them afterwards
changed by their more man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
studies and delights. For
by often letters and declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all their secrets, they
still nourished their ancient
friendship. In the meane
time an unexpected inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
had raised <hi>Caepio</hi> to a
higher condition; and <hi>Mella</hi>
               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:913:249"/>
about certaine businesses was
called into <hi>Capio's</hi> Countrey.
Of whose comming when
<hi>Caepio</hi> understood, not now so
mindefull of their old love, as
glorying to have <hi>Mella</hi> a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
of his high fortunes, hee
made haste to goe and visit
him. <hi>Mella</hi> his affection
was sincere, and not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by such assaults of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
Hee therefore with a
plaine heart goes to meet his
friend, and affectionately em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing
him, begins to reme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
all tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e things, which
friends at the first sight, after
long absence, use to doe. But
<hi>Caepio</hi> with a grave and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
looke, and an affected
voyce, as if hs were loath to
change the copy of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
began almost to sing
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:913:250"/>
to him. And when hee was
invited to follow into <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi>'s
lodging, to which, as in
houses of meane estate, there
were narrow staires; I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee,
<hi>Mella</hi> (quoth he) dost
thou lead mee into a chamber
or a prison? <hi>Mella</hi> was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
with this scornefull
majesty of <hi>Caepio,</hi> but loath
himself to offend in that kind,
told him, hee did but hyre the
lodging; that the roome,
doores, and staires were such
as travellers might make use
of. But when they were come
into the chamber, <hi>Caepio</hi> care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
flinging himselfe upon
the bed, and smiling, began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
with a rusticke urbani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to detide the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the lodging: <hi>Mella,</hi>
though hee were angry, yet
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:913:250"/>
notwithstanding (as if hee
consented to <hi>Caepio</hi>) hee hid
it with a smile also. But
hee casting his eyes round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
upon the lodging, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
hee had with a carelesse
state surveyed all the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture,
turned his eyes and
countenance vpon <hi>Mella:</hi>
And seeing his bootes,
hast thou an horse (quoth he)
or rather horses? Those that
come out of your Countrey
are of good price; and I find
none more fleete than they,
when I chase the Stagge, in
my woods. When <hi>Mella</hi>
told him hee had none of
his countrey Horses, and
though hee brought some,
yet hee had lost them by
some diseases, or, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stemper
of a strange ayre;
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:913:251"/>
why then (quoth <hi>Caepio</hi>) dost
thou weare bootes? <hi>Mella</hi>
in scorne answered him, that
he provided them against
winter. Can you tell, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>Caepio,</hi> whose Coach that is,
that stands before the doore?
When <hi>Mella</hi> told him it was
his; You said quoth <hi>Caepio,</hi>
you had no horses. Not of our
Countrey horses, said <hi>Mella;</hi>
but did you thinke I came
through this Citie a foote?
I hyred <hi>German</hi> horses to the
Coach. Did two horses or
foure draw it (quoth Caepio?)
By this time <hi>Mella</hi> began to
be fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>led with disdaine as well
as anger, but willing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
this Comaedy, he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
smilingly he had but two
horses; that he left foure for
such fortunate men as <hi>Caepio</hi>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:913:251"/>
was. Tell me then, said <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio;</hi>
are you knowne to your
King? What quantity of
Lands have you? Or doe you
command any Lordships?
<hi>Mella</hi> at this could scarce
containe laughter, but made
him answere onely, that he so
enjoyed that meane estate
which his ancestors had left
him, as that hee might
neyther discredit them, nor
ruine his posterity. Againe
when he more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> asked
him how much his annuall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
was, he answered that

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> him, and sometimes
his friends too; and by that
end especially hee valued his
wealth. But when he saw
himselfe assaulted with so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
questions, he resolved to
turne the burden of answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:913:252"/>
upon <hi>Caepio,</hi> who was
most glad of it. Therefore
<hi>Mella</hi> began to aske him how
many Servants daily attended
in his house? And afterwards
how many horses he kept?
And how gracious hee was
with his Prince? Nor was <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio</hi>
any more modest in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of himselfe than wife in
questioning of others; but his
especiall discourse was of the
Court; where he said many of
the Noblemen, were simple
people. Some of them by easie
endeavours he gained for
friends; others were taken
with admiration of his valour,
for hee had now beene twice
in the Feild; and others of
them, in respect of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>
favour, which hee had
with the King, were glad
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:913:252"/>
to proffer all offices of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to him. <hi>Mella</hi> was now
amazed, and confident that
none but a mad man could
utter this. Therefore tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
all his wearinesse into
wonder and pleasure, hee
began to urge him farther,
and with madde questions
to plunge him, that was
forward enough, into absur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities.
There was a little
rest, and both of them af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
these follies had beene
a while silent; when CAE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PIO,
as if some speciall
thing had come into his
minde, breakes out on the
suddaine, How eager thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kest
thou are my hunting
Dogges now of the Game?
For I have charged my
menne not to goe abroad
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:913:253"/>

for they are mewing their

the day growes old; f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

upon it; I should long
since have waited upon the
King. He will chide me for
being so long absent fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him.
With these words in a stately
embrace he falls upon <hi>Mella,</hi>
who more humbly saluted
him, and inviting him home
to his house, fitting his pride
to a kind of curtesie, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
him to make use of his
faithfull friendship, that desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to serve him, and request
him in what he wanted; hee
should find him true in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance
of his promises.
This was the end of their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:913:253"/>
which amazed <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi>
and made him curse so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
wealth, if it transport a
man into such madnesse.</p>
            <p>This vice of immoderate
boasting is incident not onely
to those men, whose wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
Fortune by her too so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine
guifts has overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
but to those also which
place their glory in warlike
feates. For having for the
most part, rude mindes, and
eyther nurtured in campes, or
among those men, whose
peace is infected with the
faults of campes, they thinke
nothing more glorious than
to bee feared; and absurdly
thinke to be beleeved, while
they speake of themselves.
From hence proceeds that
boldnesse in bragging and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:913:254"/>
high words, as if their swords
should purchase the favour
and beliefe of all men. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
in auncient Comedies
were the persons of <hi>Pyrgopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liniees,</hi>
and <hi>Thras<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
true dangers of a Warre. But
in Old men and Captaines e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
this fault reignes
more securely, and with more
pardon; Mindes indeed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
for glory, but erring
sometimes by inconsiderate

               </gap>e offices,
which are distinguished into
divers titles by the number of
those that practice, and the
desire of getting of wealth.
These for the most part are
advanced to their places by
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pen, and permitted bargai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

as these, sales are publike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
forbidden, by private, and
more strict contracts with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
men, they find there also
some that will sell the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.
They pay often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
so great and immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
rates for their places, that
it is plainly shewed they seeke
for them onely through am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
and hope of prey. For
to desire onely to benefit the
Commonwealth with a deare
care, which destroyes their
owne esta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> is not a vertue
of this Age, nor to be looked
for perchance since the <hi>Curij,</hi>
and <hi>Fabritu.</hi> But seeing that
no vertue is now followed
<hi>gratis,</hi> and for its owne beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
but all in respect of their
rewards are made lovely to
men: Therefore this desire of
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:913:255"/>
wealth &amp; gaine in Magistrates
may more easily bee indured,
upon condition that they, con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tent
with that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
allowed way of sinning,
will afterwards with sinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of minde behave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in their imployment.</p>
            <p>But as by that height which
they undertake, they have po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
to moderate, and if they
please, to abuse the people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them; So unlesse that by
mature wisedome, and such
as is not only capable of their
place of judicature, they can
bridle their desires, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
cannot avoyd flowtes,
and reproaches; but those for
the most part are secret ones,
and in their absence. For o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly
by flattering speeches
they are stirred up to pride,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:913:256"/>
and a vaine confidence of
themselves; whilest so many
suitors in law with great ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance,
but such as doth not
last, doe seeke their favours:
For no man, which is called
into question for his estate,
but can be content humbly to
petition the Iudges, and, if
they be harsh and froward, to
appease them; or if they lye
open to a favourable ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to feed them (like meate)
with many prasses, and crind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
gestures. <hi>Rome</hi> did long
agoe teach the world that
art, when offenders in feare
and reverence used to fall
downe at the Iudges feete,
clothed in base gownes, and
their haire in a vile manner
neglected. But all these sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants,
what end soever their
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:913:256"/>
businesses haue, assoone as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
they are gone out of the
Iudges presence, put off again
this fearefull disguise of soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;
and sometimes among
their companions remember
with great laughter, and rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon
up the flatteries which
they used, and the credulity of
those, to whom they put
them. For Iudges being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
full of succeeding
troopes of clients, doe many
times value themselves accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to their flattery, and
thinke that all those are true
honourers to their dignity,
who by a composed humility
do seeke to gaine their favour.
Those Iudges, I meane, whose
ambition is not acquainted
with the manners and subtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of our Age; which they
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:913:257"/>
have seene nothing but the
Schooles and Courts, in one
of which they used to trifle,
in the other to have obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance,
and be deceived; or
else are of narrow and easie
mindes, fondly to beleeve
them that speake for their
owne ends. But then especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
are they ridiculous to the
people, when, as if they were
ashamed of their owne condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
they put on the gestures
and words of Souldiers, or in
their attires imitate the Court
fashions, or follow other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
which are not suitable
to the majesticke gravity of
Gownes and tribunall Seates.
Which errours doe many
times overtake unexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
young men; for young
men are sometimes advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:913:257"/>
to those dignities.</p>
            <p>But nothing is more mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to a Common-wealth
than when Magistrates and
Iudges, forgetting that God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desse,
under whose name, and
by whose representation they
pronounce sentence, swayed
in their affections, either by
the greatnesse of guifts, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor
of the pleaders, are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid
to deceive the Lawes.
Nor can I easily tell which is
the greater fault to be swayed
by money or by friends; For
that easinesse in them of deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nothing to their Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
opens a Iudges breast to
all impiety, accustomed thus by
degrees to injustice, that excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
his crime with a show of
friendship, afterwards where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
hatred or hope shall
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:913:258"/>
leade him, he will not feare to
offend, and to doe that for his
owne sake, which at first he
did for his friends.</p>
            <p>But if they be eagerly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
on wealth, and seeke ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
by the peoples harmes;
then the body of the Com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monwealth
under such Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitians
is more sicke of the
remedies than of the disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
But there are few that in
an open way of villany, dare
thus to satisfie the lusts of
themselves or their friends.
There is a more lingring
plague, or, if thou wilt, a
modest cruelty; which now
by custome is almost excused;
to intangle with intricate
knots, and so prolong the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
in their Courts; to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
late, through an infinite
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:913:258"/>
and almost religions course of
orders. By these arts they
prolong their domination
over wretched men, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
them up to be more pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
by their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>cers. And
with perpetuall prey they
feed the advocates, and whole
nation almost of those which
are fatted with the spoyles
of wretched Clients. And
how intollerable are the
trickes of some? Iustice which
they are afrayd to sell openly,
they prostitute under other
Merchants. Their houshold
Servants are their Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers
and Secretaries, who
use to put into order, and to
keepe in record of writing
the causes of suitors, and the
instruments of them. But
such men they doe not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:913:259"/>
into this ambitious ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
untill by great summes
of money, which they before
by suites have gotten, they
make purchase of these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Oh miserable mockery
of the fortunes of poore
wretches, that come to these
tribunals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the servants
of Iudges are not hired, but
pay money to be admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their family and service,
what is it else but to buy a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of coosening, and by
stolne fees to rob the suitors,
and by selling their suffrages,
by either shortening or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding
bookes, dare to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
both their Masters and
aequity it selfe. But many of
these Magistrates have can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deid
mindes, and prefarre
holinesse, just honours, and
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:913:259"/>
that stipend, which the law
allowes them, before the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous
artes.</p>
            <p>These are grave men, and
modestly composed within
the greatnesse of their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune;
Nor are they praised
more by the flatterie of those
that seeke their ayde, than by
true fame of their piety and
justice. But if you value the
Courts of these Iudges not by
the manners of each in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular,
but by the gravity of
the whole Colledge or as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly,
it is wonderfull how
great a reverence they will
strike into you. For beeing
admitted into their presence,
you will altogether thinke
them worthy of that speech
of CYNEAS, who sayd
he thought himselfe enviro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:913:260"/>
by as many Kings, as <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>

               </gap> more grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

MASSANISSA King of <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midia,</hi>
who was also at friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
with <hi>Rome,</hi> had warre
with <hi>Carthage.</hi> The armies
were both encamped against
each other, and the day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
for fight; when
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:913:260"/>
SCPIO the younger, being
sent by chance upon other
businesse into <hi>Affrica,</hi> came
to the Campe of MASINIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SA,
and enjoyed the sight
of that great battaile; he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe,
which way soever For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
enclined, was secure by
the Majesty of the <hi>Roman</hi>
name. He went therefore up
to the top of an hill to view
the battell, and there secure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
enjoyed the dangers of so
many men. And it seemed to
him a matter of so ambitious
a delight, that he sayd, none
ever had had that fortune be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, but onely IOVE
from IDA, and <hi>Neptune</hi> from
<hi>Sam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of the <hi>Greekes</hi> and <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt.</hi>
The same may be sayd of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:913:261"/>
this spectacle of the Courts &amp;
Iudges, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more delightfull,
if thou stand without danger,
and have no need either to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
or feare. For thou mayst
there grow pleasantly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the learned
minds of Iudges (as many of
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are such,) or else perceive
their want of sence and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
in some causes, and so
give sentence upon the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
themselves. Or if thou
lovest to be among the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of the Court, the very
noyse of their running up and
downe, and different lookes,
some animated with feare,
some exulting with hopes, wil
so take up thy mind and eyes,
that thou wilt thinke thou
beholdest a pleasant scene of
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:913:261"/>
humaine madnesse. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
the subtilty of the
advocates, (whose eloquence
is there at sale) displaying it
selfe in ostentation of Science
and pompous language, will
be enough to give thee a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
sweet, and not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
idle; which while thou
enjoyest, thou shalt notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
with fearlesse sighes
grieve sometimes for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series
of others.</p>
            <p>For the mindes and condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the advocates (as
mankind doth turne even her
aydes to her owne ruine) are
much changed from the first
institution of officious Piety.
To pleade causes before the
Iudges, to accuse the guilty,
and defend poore Suppliants,
was once a magnificent and
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:913:262"/>
liberall office, performed by
those men to whom the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth
committed the
highest charges in the Campe
or Senate house. POMPEY
the Great stood not ofter
in battell than before the Iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
and the first CAESAR'S,
although they had all power,
yet sometimes they chose ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to aide the accused by
way of advocation, than by
the suffrage of their high au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
And that magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
function was so far from
having any hire but glory,
that when afterward that
right Nobility began to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline,
and Orators beganne to
sell their paines, lawes were
made to forbid, and brand
with infamy such dangerous
hires; and afterwards when
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:913:262"/>
the publike vice had broken
downe those barres also, yet
there was a meane set downe,
and a certain pension appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for that mercenary elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
But now when the
world grew mad, and suites
did exceedingly increase; that
thriving and numerous nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
are scarce enow for their
clients, who spoyle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to feede their owne
dissentions.</p>
            <p>But as all lawyers have one
aime euery where, to get
wealth, and fame, so accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the qualitie of the
Countries, there are different
studies, and degrees, by which
they come to that end. The
especiall part of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is to understand the
lawes, not with a cleare and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:913:263"/>
candid Genius, such as they
had which made those lawes,
but as they are perplexed
with innumerable &amp; trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
poins of subtlety. To
finde out somewhat in them
whereby to delude the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of them, that goe plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to worke, is now esteemed
the most glorious thing. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
most nations those
lawes, which the <hi>Romans</hi>
made for themselves, and we
call civill, are now in force.
And because those lawes
were founded by skilfull Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
they have strong diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity
of learning in them, and
therefore the studie of them
doth not onely store the wits
of students with deepe and
hard cases of right and fact,
but bestowes upon them a
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:913:263"/>
faire knowledge of antiquity,
which is most precious for
the adorning of humane life,
and strong (at least in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding)
for ostentation. But in
those nations, among whom
lawes were made not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the Roman wisedome,
but their owne municipall,
and sometimes barbarous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretalls,
there the unpleasant
art of lawiers containes scarse
any thing of humanity in it,
and unlesse it promised them
gaine, would be hatefull even
to those that are the most
studious in it. For there the
Lawyers dresse not their wits
with the Roman and Graeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
science or eloquence, but
sticking upon certain termes,
and contemplating the lawes
sometimes for caution, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:913:264"/>
for deceit, they scarce
ever adorne or raise theyr
mindes with purer learning.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England,</hi> which has enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
the Muses, and all stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of Learning in most state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
houses, and enriched them
with great and high reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues,
as it were to perpetuate
learning to Eternity, cannot
therefore adorne her Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
of the Law with the
humanity of Philosophy, and
the Roman eloquence; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
in her lawes there are
no tracts and footsteps of the
Roman law, or learned anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
They are conceived in
the French tongue, even that
old French, which wee now
eyther neglect or laugh at in
ancient Authors. If there be
any words in it, which are
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:913:264"/>
now currant, even those
wordes, by changing the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents,
and errour of pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,
they have made their
owne. Those that are Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
in this law, doe sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
regard any greater Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and for the most part
doe not learne the elements
of the Roman language. It is
thought enough for the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
of a lawyer to be able to
reade over those old bookes,
and corrupt them in pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation.
The young students
live in colledges ordained for
those subtleties, and by long
time, by conference with the
ancients, and experience, are
instructed in them: for it is
no small part of their age that
will suffice to make them lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in an art so laborious, and
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:913:265"/>
amplified by so many wits.
There is no more certaine
way to riches in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
For <hi>England</hi> quiet now
from forreine warres, is
(with almost as great a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction)
given wholly over
to Law contentions; and see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that the greatest Offices,
and Magistracies are ordained
as rewards for that kind of
learning, no marvell it is if
the noblest young men be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
with the study of it; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
as there is scarce any
house of Gentry, but in suites
can finde Lawyers of theyr
owne kindred. Those Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
as a badge of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
doe weare long
Gownes downe to their feet,
faced with theyr owne Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ies
skinnes. This is their
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:913:265"/>
weare at home, and their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament
abroad; nor doe they
make any scruple of going in
publike Booted, their Spurres
tearing their Gowne that
beates against them.</p>
            <p>But <hi>France</hi> in other vertues
and vices doth instruct her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates.

But both of them (oh the

should bee given to

Learned men and Lawyers
were subject to so base a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary

so undeservingly admitted to
that degree, doe afterwards
live in ignoble Colonyes,

if they bee borne of rich

another and a greater power,

the administration of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

a man from high fame, who

this power of learning hath
not taken effect; how easily

was the great Creator of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

turning those lawes, which
they make, to the lust and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions
of their owne
Nation. Nor can those
which offend in this kinde
(as in other wickednesse it
oft falls out) be deceived
themselves, or blinded with
love of their owne opinions,
or the things in question;
but being conscious to their
owne wickednesse, they
know themselves to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
and the plagues of
Mankind; especially when
to perswade the people to
such a serious novelty is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
a most bold presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
in subtill wit, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
many lyes are to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented;
as namely that they
saw or heard the Deity;
that they consulted with
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:913:271"/>
him; and whatsoever else
those lewd impostors use to
averre. But this is not a mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefe
incident to every
age; for but few (and not
alwayes with successe) have
gone so farre as to that most
impious audacity. There is
another kinde of men, and
farre more frequent, of
those who professe not to
forsake the religion of their
Fathers, or to broach any
novelty; but onely with
more pure precepts to roote
out errours which by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
corruption and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to the minde of antiquity
have crept into religion.
And these men carry a most
magnificent show of honesty,
and reverent wisedome (for
who but subtill and industri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:913:272"/>
men would venture on so
great a matter?) And lastly,
the very desire of innovating
and differing from other men
doth almost alwayes finde a
multitude of followers. The
wrangling of such interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
have much more divided
the OTHOMAN Princes
from the PERSIAN by
difference of Superstition
than by emulation of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.
But what matters it
how those people perish, who
must needs erre, what sect
soever they undertake to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low?
But who would not
grieue that wee our selves
which are borne into the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

of learned men bee

               </gap>asted? For
sixeteene ages, in which our
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:913:272"/>
religions have flourished,
have brought forth above an
hundred wits, which by a
desire of innovation, and our
calamities have gotten them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
a fame. Whose procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings
as I can never excuse
(for by too great a fault of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy
they transgresse against
that modesty, in w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> they see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
to begin) so we may not
alwayes justly hate their first
motions. For wealth, sloth,
and idle security have with an
impotent p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ide and other vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
overwhelmed all disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
among many of us; and
from thence as well the just
indignation of learned men
hath bin stirred, as the pride
of busie bodies, shadowed
with the veile of piety, hath
beene first fostered. For some
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:913:273"/>
possessed with just sorrow
have thundered against it; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
with a secret ambition
have loved the vices of the
age, as things that would give
just occasion to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints
and separation. They
use to have both one begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
At the first they question
not many things, and those
very sparingly, assisted by the
prayers and exhortations of
the best men: nor doe they
seeme so much to be angry as
to admonish, and with sighs
to p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ofesse their griefe. But
when they are gotten to the

               </gap>tion, then with
more freedome doe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke
their adversaries, and on
both sides is kindled a most
hot &amp; furious emulat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

can they neither modest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y e-
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:913:273"/>
guide the fortune of so great
a fame, nor continue in those
steps, by which at the first
they seemed to goe to that
godly and good endeavour;
but rising up with a greater
pride, they condemne more
things in their adversaries,
and with greater vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;
eyther because they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire,
in a miserable ambition,
to give their owne names to
that Sect which they have
made: or because they
durst not betray, but by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,
the first intention of
their separation; or else be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
their hatred is more
incyted against those who did
too fiercely and unseasonably
contend against their first and
wholsome reprehensions. So
many that with pio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings

haue entered upon
this taske of reformation,
have beene afterwards betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by pride and bitternesse of
emulation.</p>
            <p>But there are some who by
a true and stout wisedome are
encouraged to taxe those vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which by the fault of
Priests have shadowed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
under the Cloake of
religion. These men, whose
just zeale is thus tempered
with true modesty, must needs
be of a sublime and valiant
disposition, and (which is
ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e) not labouring at all for

               </gap>l speeches they
are neyther stirred to hatred,
nor righted from their good
intentions. This is a most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:913:274"/>
atchievment, and a
worke of high vertue? For
those, who are reprehended
by them, are seldome wanting
to their vices, nor w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> patience
can they endure a censurer.
But they will find some glosse
to set upon their villanies, or
(which is worse) stand out in
a stiffe defence of them; &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to bring those good
admonishers, into an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion

               </gap>ilegious impiety
among the people.</p>
            <p>But as the rites of begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

upon the industry and <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi>
of their Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ders: so,
after they are approved by
the people, they haue their
officers by whom they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred.
These men by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:913:275"/>
Nations are honoured
with different titles: we call
them high Priests, Bishops,
and by other titles of that
nature. There is no better
Governement then this to
preserve Religion; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
was instituted by the
prescript of Heaven. Those
among them, which are of a
learned and laborious vertue,
doe indeed up hold the safety
of Religion; those that are
wicked, doe uphold it, at
least in show, and by vertue
of their dignity.</p>
            <p>It was once a function
of great labour, and, whilest
our Religion was forbidden
by publike lawes, of high
and extreame danger: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward
when the cruelty
of our enemies was ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:913:275"/>
and extinguished, that
wealth, which was heaped
upon them to uphold the
reverence of that dignity,
did almost extinguish the
cause of reverence. For
when temporall wealth and
honours were added (as it
was fit they should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded)
to those Divine cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings,
so great a burthen
beganne to disperse them to
the Earth, by the default of
those, who in such a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of these two, beganne
to preferre Earth before Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
It is a sad argument
of decaying honesty, that a
function of so great labour
and care, which was wont
to seeke out for Incumbents,
is now sought for with
much eagernesse and ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:913:276"/>
by men, that thinke of
nothing lesse then piety and
labour.</p>
            <p>So this excellent and coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall
dignity is for the most
part ruined by her owne
wealth and ornaments. And
to apply a mans minde to
those functions is for the
most part to be entent in
raising of high and eminent
riches. And those that are
possessed of those ambitious
titles, doe spend that wealth
and treasure, which was first
given for publike Hospitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
upon their private wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse,
which pleaseth it
selfe sometimes with a
vaine delight in Pictures,
sometimes in the curious la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
of other Artificers; for
a modest sorrow would be
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:913:276"/>
ashamed to speake of those
that spend them in worse
things, and plaine villany.
But what madnesse is it not
onely to dare to commit
those villanies, but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
to be ignorant how
much they offend? For they
have prayers prescribed them
to God, holy ones indeede,
and such as they ought not
to omit; but having perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
that little taske, they
thinke then they owe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to Heaven, and the
wealth of their Miters is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
bought by them. What
strange vizards are these and
foolish madnesse? to thinke
that that function, which
by a daylie and strict labour
thou canst scarce performe,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:913:277"/>
should be fulfilled by a slight
and perfunctory worke. But
if they would season their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
with this wholesome
cogitation, that they are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in a watch-tower, and are
called Shepheards; if any
of the sheepe do perish by
their sloath, it will proove
their owne destruction, this
though perchance would al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
the licence of their wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse,
pompe, and jollity.</p>
            <p>But all doe not wallow in
the same delights and sloath.
Some doe abate something
from the charge of their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
to bestow upon learned
men; themselves also are
given to learning, but it is
but in a short fit, not to last,
and sometimes in show only.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:913:277"/>
Some of them doe attaine to
good learning, overcomming
sloath by a happy strength
of wit. But they u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e that
learning more in nothing
than in mainteining the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges
of that dignitie
which they possesse. They
find out arguments for infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
liberties of their owne,
and their hidden lusts doe
make them eloquent. By
this meanes while they seeme
to looke up onely into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and pleade the cause of
God; they are staked to the
Earth.</p>

splendour to the good of
the people, and the grace
of Divine service (as there
are alwayes some such) those
will neither endure to loose
the priviledges which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
to their dignities, nor
encroach upon other-mens;
but in a good contemplation
they joyne together how
much they can doe, and how
much they ought. These are
men composed after the
image of the old sanctity, of
the same cares, and the same
manner of life, which in old
time did deserve that wealth,
which the Church now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes.
Lastly, these men (let
none envy what I say) are
truely worthy of the wealth
which old times bestowed,
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:913:278"/>
and of our highest reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</p>
            <p>The people cannot be suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
taught from the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
owne mouthes, for the
number of them is but small.
From hence a great number
of learned men, and graduates
in Divinity are maintained e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
where, of whom some
truely and wisely doe labour
in that science which they
professe; but others, you
would suppose, do labor more
to uphold a faction, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to find
out truth. For carryed away
with a great violence of mind
they allow of a defence of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
nature to proove to the
people the sanctity of their
religion, and love to advance
piety, though by impious
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:913:279"/>
meanes. Therefore to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
their owne propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
they thinke they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
fairely and with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations,
although e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
arguments may bring
credit to that which they
beleeve true. And speaking
of their adversaries, they doe
not truely deliver their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,
but spitefully turne
them, almost contrary to the
sence of the Authors. But
that mad desire of controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie
doth so farre heighten
their emulation, that where
they begin a little to differ,
they will afterwards be crosse
in all things from those men;
and thinke that a kind of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
And then, as if those
men who once have erred,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:913:279"/>
could hold or reproove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
rightly, they thinke it
a sinne to acknowledge in
themselves any spots which
those men have found out,
and to wash them away by a
true reformation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by striving to defend
those things which plaine
truth tells us cannot bee
maintained, they bring an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just
praejudice upon the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest
and true part of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie.</p>
            <p>There is a great affinitie
betweene all sorts of Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing;
and the same affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
which trouble Divines,
doe fall upon the other stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of the Muses; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that custome of insisting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
learned Controversies, and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:913:280"/>
bringing them almost to
plaine hatred. The wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of Lawyers doe grow
even almost to uncivill words,
threatning to each other the
whip in our Age. Physicke is
divided into sects with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
obstinacy; because they
hunt for fame not onely for
their owne glory, but to gaine
wealth; nor are theyr con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies
ever in jest, or for
pleasure onely, whilest sicke
men must undeservedly suffer
for whatsoever they thinke
amisse. But the kindes of all
Learned men may bee distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished
into two rankes:
One is of those men which
are happie in much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
and erudition, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
polished also with ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:913:280"/>
disciplines, they doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd
the carelesse vility of
Scholasticall manners: The
other of those men whose
mindes are bent wholly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
letters, being more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant
in the rotten foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps
of Antiquity than in
their owne Age; These for
the most part are foolish a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and sordid at home.
For they know not nor care
for any other Elegancy, than
that solitary elegance, which
they receive from contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation
of the Muses, and
had rather enjoy it so, than
make true use of it. Yet
may you converse with these
men to a great benefit of
your selfe, if you know how
to extract gold out of their

in those ornaments, which
in them are not seene, as
covered over with
much dust and
rubbish.
