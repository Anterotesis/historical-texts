         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ESteeming it the greatest Honor I ever yet had,
that I have served under your Lord-ship, not
only in the General cause that those true Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish
Spirits in <hi>Colchester</hi> were embarqued in, but
also under your Lord-ships particular command in the
store, subjected to your Lord-ship as Commissary Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral:
I have presumed, (emholdened by that Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
wherewith your Lord-ship then obliged not only
me, but all that knew you) to present your Lord-ship
with this smal discourse. Being a sum of what, your
Lord-ship, and those Heroick spirits, then (joyned in
command with you) labor'd for. The observation of
Laws and Iustice is a cause no man need ever be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of; but what those Heroick endeavors then mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of, God hath now given us hopes, may be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in a more peaceable manner; having opened a
way to us for reason to be heard; and reduced us from
the use of barbarous violence, to the force of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
fitter Weapons for human societies. Tis with
such my Lord, that, I have endeavor'd here to be still
an assertor of that general cause of <hi>Englands</hi> liberty,
<pb facs="tcp:119218:3"/>
to the utmost of my Capacity. And tis my hopes, your
Lord-ship, that were then a strenuous defender of
this cause by your valor in that <hi>Bellum Martiale,</hi> wil
now grant your Protection to him that by this submits
himself your Servant, whilest your Lord-ship in
Parliament are now managing this <hi>Bellum Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riale:
Bellum</hi> I cannot but term it because stil there
appears many opposers of Iustice it self, which is our
cause, having no argument (but their fucated pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
to Saints-ship) to cover the great injustices
they have done; but my Lord when like paint on faces
these are melted off by the impartial scrutiny of Iustice,
there appeares nought but Rapines, and meer Wolves
under the Sheeps Clothing: which disguise; since it hath
occasioned the devouring of so many Lambs, I hope for
the future our Shephards will so defend us by the pale
of Iustice that we may hereafter be secure, and every
man admitted to that which Law calls his own. Of the
want of which pale your Lord-ship hath been as sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
as any by the injuries you have suffered, both in
Estate and Liberty. If the meanness of my perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances
cause your Lord-ship to censure me Presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
in perfixing your Name to so smal a discourse,
my Petition is, that my zeal both to Iustice and
your Lord-ships Service may beg pardon for: my

            <head>THE
FREE-BORN
English Mans Plea
FOR
JUSTICE.</head>
            <p>THere have bin of late many Papers Published
under the names of Pleas. As the purchasers
Plea; the sequesterd clergies Plea, and the
Plea of them that are in the benefices of
these, and the Plea of them whose Lands
the others have purchased, these latter writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
in answer to the former, but in my opinion (at a time
of so general a concernement when all are interressed, and
all expecting a general satisfaction to the whole nation)
these Pleas are too much restrained to particular interests,
to terminate in a general union of all, which were the only
blessing to be wished for by all which have the least pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
to Christianity, or any spark of the hope of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
satisfactory conscience, which I shall alwaies
esteem the greatest temporal blessing men can wish for;
These Pleas are likewise a very ill example for every man
to seek his own interest, which perhaps may make men
draw divers waies and therefore likelier increase divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
(of which this Nation hath had too much) than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them.</p>
            <p>That therefore a more charitable way may be found, it
behoves every man to ponder such things in his minde, and
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:119218:4"/>
(if he acts at al) to excite others to endeavour the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of such interests wherein al are equally concern'd; and
which have such rootings naturally in every mans consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,<note place="margin">Nich. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiav. Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put. de Rep. Cap. 27.</note>
that (though he should with the bryers and cares
of this world intend the stiffing of that good seed)
he can not (at least wil not) before men gainsay the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
for tis seldom seen that a man is totally good, or abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
wicked. Because of some sparklings of that inward
self accusing light which (should he impudently out dare)
would render him odious even to his own accomplices
seeing him lay aside all thoughts of shame.</p>
            <p>First, Therefore (mans life being a race through this
world to another, his chief aim is how he may run that
race most to his own peculiar benefit; (for we are all by
nature lovers of our selves) to which purpose mankind
being now grown numerous if we were without order; as
wild beasts, we should be a pray one to another, so as to
have many unquiet interruptions in our race and not only
so but to be without those mutual conveniences which we
might have one of another; now to rectifie these incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences
it hath pleased God to send into the world disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines:
to defend men in societies from the aforesaid abuses
and direct them in their race with comfort; these disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plines
are two: Eclesiastical, to direct them to the end of
their race, and civil, or political: to direct them in their
race; and to fit men for these orders in their societies he
gave that general tie of Justice for a rule, and planted in us
a sparkling beam of his truth to witness unto us this Justice
and be as our magnetick ballance, to fit us to act his will,
the more conformably under his ordinances, this is that
diamond of Conscience that excuses or accuses every man
and alwaies tels our Souls the truth, if Lusts be not the
perspective Medium through which we see, which often
dazels our understanding: by which means we are often led
into the more tempting way leaving that which our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science
tels us to be the more Just. Now for regulating such
deviations, and depravations of our apprehensions it was
requisite that provision should be made by discipline, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
therefore the Eclesiastical discipline and its unity (as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:119218:4"/>
not any branch of this discourse) to men whose profession
it is (that being the very top of the building to beautifie
and confirme the foundation laid by the civil) I think it
might be much more pertinent to the condition of our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
at present if every man would make it his request that
we might enjoy that firm hand of all societies, JUSTICE.
being the true rule to regulate all actions in any society
whatsoever and give up his cause to such a decree; but in
regard we are (apt looking through the fraudulent Medium
of lusts before mentioned) to be too partial in our own
causes, tis not fit we be our own judges; The party per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
that thinks himself injur'd if he have not his will;
will be apt to say, neither ought our adversaries to be
judges in their own cause against us, so say I; who then?
JUSTICE say I: So I beleeve all men will be ready
to say too, what ever they think, yet will not they say
they desire any thing but Justice, but cannot have that;
yes, but any English man may really say we can have
Justice, our Fathers have so labor'd in their daies, that
we receive from them both Tree and Fruit, for in Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
or civil Discipline it is impossible to maintaine any at
all,<note place="margin">Tullij. Offic. Lib. 1.</note> without order, whose business it is to fit every thing
to its proper place to appoint some to Judg in cases of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between party and party which Judgment though
in the Infancy of the world it were, wholly left to the
discretion of the Judg, yet finding men apt to be byassed
by Alliance, favor, brybery. &amp;c. it was then found a very
unsatisfactory way, the suffering party being apt alwaies
to think himself wronged whether so or not; to prevent
which it was thought a much more indifferent course to
have all cases reduced into Judgments, which should be
for Laws, to decide all controversies, and prescribe all
penalties, whatsoever. By which means men had a rule
to walk by to direct them what was evil or good, what to
persue or avoid, what to be encouraged or punished for:
so that it was some satisfaction to them that they were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curd
from particular Spleen or Malice of others, and by
this means were not damnified for any thing, of which,
they were not forewarned by the Law: No, nor the Judg
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:119218:5"/>
himself could give any censure that was not prescribed to
him in the same Law: of this Nature were the Laws of
<hi>Lycurgus, Moses</hi> and most of the Antients that were Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givers:
but in regard, this power of Law making in the
vicissitude of times is somtimes devolved to men of less
qualified parts and integrity, and that such did somtimes
make Laws, too, too, partial to themselves and too too
grating upon the liberties and properties of others, Al the
Laws, which were of equity (and held proportion with
that rule <hi>Do unto all Men as you would they should do unto
you</hi>) were by <hi>Iustinian</hi> drawn in Canons, and are stil used
in a great part of Europe, and called by the Name of the
Civil Law, but though here were a good provision for
Laws there was not so good a provision for giving Right
Judgment as could be wished for; because the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the Law and interpretation of the fact were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd
to the breast of one man which was thought might be
prejudicial to the true distribution of Justice; Wherefore
our Auncesters in this Nation I think have taken the most
satisfying course, most Just, most free, and generous way
of all other Nations; for first to preserve true discipline,
we have the Magistracy and Nobility our Law-giving po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer
in as great and true a state of Honor and Justice and
far more equitable then any of the former; for our Prince
and Peers have this priviledg only of constituting Laws:
and of appointing Judges for the distribution of Justice to
the whole Nation. Next a far greater liberty and security
to the Commonalty because though they make not the
Laws yet they contrive and compose al the Laws by which
any of them are bound, so that it is as satisfactory a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
as can be contrived for a man to be tied by no Laws
but such as himself and Ancesters have tied and bound
themselves by their own consent, and with all these Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers
after sessions in Parliament is ended are as subject
to be punished by these Laws as any other by which means
the whol commonalty have as much security as can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised;
the self preservation of the devisers of the Law
themselves, being the buckler for every man against par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality:
And more than this; least Laws so prudently
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:119218:5"/>
contrived might be perverted in the dispensation; the
Judges are restrained from interpreting the fact of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent
who is to be tried by twelve of his Peers; as if it
were their own case, so that all the Justice imaginable is
in the Constitution of our Government so that for any to
complaine and say he can not have Justice is a very falsity,
if he can have the aforesaid administration of it, if he can
not; he may have his remedies against any where he finds
the default or obstacle.</p>
            <p>But now I have run through so great a digression I shall
returne to the cause of it from whence I swerved; These
Plea's I say coming out on both sides now when the times
begin to calme after so terrible a tempest would make a
foraigner that should read them, think we had nought but
tumultuary proceedings and imagine that they that could
make most of their part should get the advantage of their
adversaries; certainly to quiet Jealous spirits it is very
necessary to tel such if they be lovers of Justice (as I questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
not but they will say they are) that its sit every man
have Justice: for Justice is the maine piller of a Nations
safety; for as in our bodies the due distribution of all
Humors to every part its due and the preserving every
part in its right temper and composition are the efficient
causes of a mans health, unless some part contrary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
be foul, corrupt or gangrened, then it is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
to the health of the whole somtimes to divert the
nourishment and Humors, somtimes to cauterise, somtimes
to cut it off. But mark! this is when it transgresses the
Laws of Nature; so likewise these that make Pleas for
their losses if they have not transgressed any known Laws
that were in force before their fact (objected) were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:
tis fit the due distribution of Justice of giving
every man his due, procure them a restitution to what
they have been by the distempers of the times deprived of;
but if they have transgressed any such known Laws, that
were in force before their fact, then let them in Gods name
receive the penalties, allotted by those Laws for such
trespasses, and none other: this is the true birth right of
every free-borne English man and this he ought to have in
Justice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:119218:6"/>On the Contrary if they that are in possession whether
benefices or other purchased Lands have such true Titles
to their Possessions as the Laws of the land shall justifie,
we cannot think such injustice can be permitted by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty,
as to suffer them to be expelled contrary to Laws,
of which his Royal Proclaimation hath given them assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
but if the Laws of the Land wil not Justifie their
possessions, 'tis great injustice they should hold them both
to the detriment of those in present, that ought to enjoy
them, and to be an il example or encouragement to others
to enrich themselves out of others ruines for the future;
for without a Buyer there can be no Seller; therefore
where the Law did not Justifie that Title, at the time of
bargain. In the name of God let Justice frustrate, aud re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>store
to the just owner according to the true Title, and let
not our Age seek to justifie wrong by a post fact Law, for
which these Kingdoms have already felt such sore Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
one such Law to take the blood of one man in that
nature hath been revenged upon the whole three nations
with the blood of many; and should post fact lawes be
now created to take the Estates of those which were not
forfeitable by Laws extant at the time of the forfeiture, I
pray God do not revenge it after the same manner upon
the three Nations and lay al of them desolate; Rom. 7. 7.
<hi>What shal we say then is the Law sin? God forbid. Nay, I had
not known sin but by the Law for I had not known sin except
the Law had said, Thou shalt not covet:</hi> Where there is any
forfeiture of an Estate there needs no post fact Law to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
it, for that Law which makes a man an offender, hath
the forfeiture annexed to it; <hi>If post fact Laws be allowed,
Who knows when he does amiss?</hi> Therefore both dispossessed
and Possessors, gainers and loosers, if ye agree in nothing
else, agree in this one voyce; <hi>Fiat Iustitia.</hi> You would
be loath either of you to be accounted unjust; ye ought
not to be your own Judges, the Law ought to be our Judg:
for as Justice is, and ought to be the rule to our Law-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
in making their Laws, to shew them what should be
Law; so should the Law be both to them and us the rule
of what is Justice. They that fear the Law are partial
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:119218:6"/>
and of a Tyranous spirit seeking a priviledg for themselves
above their fellows, whereas Justice, and Laws are alwaies
general, &amp; priviledg or punish every man alike in the same
case making no difference to any; and this is the liberty of
the subject to have al in the same capacity with him excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
only such as are impowred with the supream over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
of the whol. To prevent those innumerable inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences
which such (should they be in hazard) might preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate
the Nation into. Nevertheless by that exception are
they subjected as much or more to the bond of love, for
their own strength, as they could have been by the penal
laws but with far more security to the Nation.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore, that Justice is, that general priviledg
wherein all Just and equal interests are most priviledged:
let us with one mind think of no other Plea than that,
which I hope will be so provided for by his Majesty and
the Parliament now sitting that there will be no need of
promoting any pleas for it: for no man petitions at any
time for what he hath, but what he wants, so that it is the
part of every man to rest satisfied in expectation of what
is preparing by them (whom we should very much injure)
to think would omit, or act any thing that Justice should
not require; but when any such thing is, then promote
Pleas for Justice according to the known Laws, but in
your particular Pleas to make such objections as one is out
so much monies, and is like to be ruined, if he be deprived
of what he holds; or that such were deboist in their lives.
On the other side that we are brought to poverty, those
that possest our estates are so, or so, these savor more of
passion than reason, for it they that have gamed the seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
Estates have them by Law, the others poverty is no
reason they should loose their right: but if the others
have lost their Estates without Law, There is no equity
but that Law should restore them; 'tis not the debauchery
laid to their charge (which besides is to be proved as wel
as said) that excuses any man in anothers right; for wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
a man is legally possessed; of that he is to be deem'd
true owner in the same capacity he was at first invested
with, til the Law disposess him again, and whosoever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:119218:7"/>
without his consent before such declaration be made
by Law, hath as much title to it, as a Thief on the high way
to the money in a mans purse; for such entries are not by
the right door. The Laws of the Land are the right door
to all manner of possessions.<note place="margin">Iohn, 10. 1.</note> 
               <hi>Whoso therefore comes not in
by the right door the same is a Thief and a Robber,</hi> saith
Christ. And though this may have been a Judgment on
such as did set their minds too to much upon this world to
wean them from <hi>laying up treasures to themselves upon earth
where moth and rust do corrupt and Thieves break through
and steal</hi> they should be so deprived that they might <hi>lay up
treasures in Heaven &amp;c.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 6. 19, 20.</note> God send all men to make use of
his dispensations to his glory, he can renew his Judgments
on them when they give him the same provocation.</p>
            <p>But as the Infirmities of men (if they be true) ought
not to bar them of the priviledge of the Law, so ought not
the excellency of any man or Saint-like Godliness (to cal
it by the usual word) priviledg him to do injustice against
Law: Nay 'tis vehemently to be suspected that where a
godly man drives on designs of depriving any man of his
right (before the Law hath divested him of it) that his
godliness is but seeming not reall, for Justice is the fit
foundation to build godliness on, Justice may be where
godliness is not, but godliness cannot be where Justice is
not: therefore such assertors of their own righteousness
may wel be conjectured Pharisee like less Justifiable than
the poor dejected Publican,<note place="margin">Luke, 18. 11.</note> for though they are more cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumspect
in Punctillio's yet they omit the weighty mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
of doing Justice, Obeying Princes, and Laws; and
this their desire of holding what they have (without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
had to the Justness of it) very much discovers;
for we Judg by the fruits,<note place="margin">Math. 7. 17.</note> not the flowers. And whereas
these may superficially for a mask of such intrusion
plead Orders of Parliament to be the Law that authorized
their possession; 'tis very wel known in <hi>England</hi> that no
order of Parlliament was ever pleaded to be in force lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
than the Session of that Parliament which made it, but
that such orders as they hold necessary to continue were
drawn into Acts and confirmed by the Approbation of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:119218:7"/>
King: therefore in this respect their Plea for such a Title
is now fully void, that Parliament after a double resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
being quite rooted up by their own Act; if the death
of the late King had not nulled it before: next 'tis obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
that those Orders they can plead in that behalf
were made by scarce half the Parliament; the other half
being removed to <hi>Oxford</hi> by the Kings Order (for though
he had released the power of dissolving, he had not that
of removing it) where they joyntly with the consent of
the King set out Proclaimation for the Continuance of all
Ministers in their benefices til duly convicted and ejected
by a lawful authority: so that to any unbyassed man
such a Proclimation had much more reason to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
than any they can plead to the Contrary: as to other
sequestrations, they, and these too, have only one excuse,
that there were Wars then in the Land (the Justness of
which (that things may come to a composure) is not fit
to be examined) which procured many things as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary
that could not be Justified in peace, for <hi>Inter arma si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
leges</hi>) to which nevertheless it may very well be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered
that though sequestrations were then necessitated,
yet since it hath pleased God that the daies of oppression
and violence should be shortened by procuring a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding
between his Majesty and his People:<note place="margin">Mark, 13 20.</note> God
forbid injustice should stil remain, or that postfact Laws
should be created at their own unjust desires to confirm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
because it hath been made good by a strong hand;
for a while,</p>
            <p>But here may be infer'd the old Objection to Law and
Justice that <hi>sumum jus</hi> is <hi>summa injuria;</hi> which I to avoid
other Objections willingly in general grant: but if these
use this as a reasonable Objection in this case that exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in doing right, be great wrong, what is extremity of
wrong; surely an oppression beyond a name; Christ useth
this kind of Argument;<note place="margin">Math. 6. 23.</note> 
               <hi>If the light that is in them be dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
then how great is that darkness?</hi> so if the very extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of Justice (pressed against these men) shal be thought
great wrong? what wrong do they think those suffered,
that lost wrongfully all they had, thus long; certainly
they may be somthing sensible when they think, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:119218:8"/>
on these things; I wish they may and repent for som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
else, than that they are permitted to do injustice no
longer, for as hitherto that hath appeared their greatest
trouble, not for what ill they have done, but for what
they cannot do. But this is no Godly sorrow.</p>
            <p>But having admitted the Objection made against the
beauty and benefit of true Justice, I say <hi>England</hi> hath
made Happy provision in that behalf, for in deciding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies,
we have the High Court of Chancery, to miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
the rigor of the Law of proprieties; and in matters
Capital because they are all <hi>Culpae lesae Majestatis,</hi> they
have their mitigation in the Kings breast; whose peroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
is to remit punishments that are against his royalty
or Person; as he shall in his clemency see reason for it:
not medling usually with any mans propriety. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of these can give any relief in this case to them that
plead for mitigation; for these can but moderate the rigor
of the Law, by extenuating or remitting the penalty that
is subject to their prerogatives, but cannot lay it on the
shoulders of them that ought not to bear it; for 'twere a
miserable doing of equity to the guilty, by obtruding in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice
on the guiltless. We have many Commands and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples
for being mercifull in our Justice, but none, that
our mercy to offenders should make us unjust, and cruel
to the innocent; 'twere a strange sentence if a Judg from
the Bench giving Judgment on a Criminall guilty of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glary
or such like offence should say, <hi>By the Law thou
oughtest to die, nevertheless that mercy may abate this rigor
thou shalt but be half hanged, and he whom thou hast robbed
shal be half hanged with thee,</hi> but far worse if he should
hang the innocent and let the offender enjoy his booty,
the transferring the sentence, or part on the innocent is of
the same nature and holds proportion very wel, if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
must lose their whole or part of their estates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
Law, to save the losses of such as ought to be punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for their unjust intrusion, besides the loss of the estates
so gotten. But if these lay a farther stress on the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Majesties referring all to the sentence of the
Parliament. I say God forbid, that there could be such a thing
in <hi>England</hi> as an unjust Parliament. Unjust Factions, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:119218:8"/>
pieces of mock Parliaments we have too sensibly felt, but to
imagine that a whole Parliament free from force, or fear can be
so perverted is a kind of Blasphemy against the dignity of so E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
an Assembly, so fundamental in our Constitution of
Governments as that is; And although his Majesty hath
been gratiously pleas'd in his clemency to submit these matters
of Controversie to their composure; his yeilding to their arbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration
will not by them be deemed a sufficient warrant for them
to be unjust in their umpirage. If the matter in Controversie
belong to one of the parties; 'tis not to be called an equal Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration
if the Umpire shal part it between both parties, Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
consists in doing Justice, but stil upon lawful considerations;
so it suffers not the Morgagee to take the forfeiture of the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gager;
but it alwaies provides that the morgagee shal have no
loss neither in principal nor interest; because the Law makes
the bargain, a just bargain on both parts; but when the Law
Justifies not the alienation; why one man should be justified
in buying anothers right of them that had nothing to do with it;
not any thing to color such sales or disposures more than a Thief
that it too strong for a man; wil never seem reasonable. God be
thanked Right, and Might, were never made <hi>termini convertibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>
til of late when our nation through the violence of the Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it
labored withal suffered a <hi>delirium,</hi> hideous Fancies crept
into the seat of Reason, misinforming the whol. <hi>Solomon</hi> hath
given us a very imitable example to follow in our arbitrations;
for though like a wise Arbitrator he pretended the division of
the Child between the true Mother and the false; yet having by
that found out the truth, <hi>he restord the Child whol and living
to the right Mother</hi> with the applause of all for his Justice and
Wisdom;<note place="margin">1 Kings 3. 27, 28.</note> my hopes and prayers shal be: that God wil not suffer
either his Wisdom or Justice to shine less in our Senators than
in <hi>Solomon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if they make that other general Plea that their acquies<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the return of his Majesty ought to be Considerable in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigating
the Rigor of Justice, &amp; his return ought to procure such
an Union as to take away all animosities and distinctions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever,
that they together with others might make one harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
body of people, and not be yeilded up to any severity
more than others; I answer first that not one of a hundred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terressed
in any such unjust acquests, had the least good liking
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:119218:9"/>
to this revolution, but as much as in then lay, both with body, &amp;
mind endeavor'd all such meant to hinder it, as was possible for
them to contrive; by which the Parliament and Nation are
not so obliged to them in point of gratitude as some of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend:
And farther though that consideration, were eminent e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to obliterate all past disaffections (though visibly it be
far otherwise) yet ought not far greater merits than they can
plead for, to priviledg them more than the rest of their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>subjects;
for if they be continued in such Possessions, as the
Common Laws of the land wil not Justifie them in; are not
they made above Law to their advantage? and others whose
right the Law saies it is, oppressed against Laws; so that if it
should pass thus; breach of Laws, Peace, Justice, &amp;c. would be
rewarded with privildges above and against Laws; and Duty O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,
Conformity to Laws, Honesty, good Conscience and
loyalty (which let me tel you is no smal virtue in any Member of
a body politicko) ppressed contrary to Law and equity: which
were a pestilent perverting of the very essential constitution of
al Governments; and a poyson beyond al Antidotes; for as Justice
is the greatest maintainer, &amp; efficient cause of the wel being of a
Nation, so injustice, the greatest poyson &amp; destroyer that can be
permitted; but that Government that shal prescribe so broad a
way for the propagation of it, like a dispairing man provides
the readiest instrument for its own destruction that may be;
and renders it self highly guilty of self murder.</p>
            <p>All this pleads still with the most equitable moderation but
for equity on all parts, that we may have all the same Laws,
nor is it my drift to urge rigor at all against the greatest offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
whatsoever: but shal while I breath desire so much Justice
that Laws may be equally general to all; and that upon so little
deserts the worst of subjects might not have their unjust actions
countenanced nor the truest subjects for their duty, and love
both to King and Laws, Country, and Justice be injur'd by post
fact laws, such things as no honest man! that made Conscience
of his actions, would ever need; No modest man! that did not
arrogantly seek to priviledg his unjustifiable actions, could ever
have impudence to demand; So barbarous are they, that there
is but one Nation, or rather herd of wolvish Tartars that even
own'd them; These are those Spiders Webs, that catch only
the laboring Bees, but let ravenous Waspes, and Hornets go
free; and since they have been, and are still endeavored to be
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:119218:9"/>
made so mischeivous to this Nation; we have as much reason to
insert them into our lettany as the Plague, Pestilence, or Famin;
and indeed the Judgment that such Laws are like to bring upon
us, may give all good men just cause to say: <hi>From Post-fact
Laws and the contrivers of them good Lord deliver us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for the last Asylum. Or resuge that those Law breakers
have for themselves to say that others are wicked, themselves
good, others profane themselves holy, others Devils, themselves
Saints; and many expressions of like Nature; first let me tell
them tis an ill signe for people to speak well of themselves; and
no Law either of God or man in any Nation ever accepted of a
mans testimony in his own cause; and Christ himself denies it of
himself: though the transcendency of his person might have pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged
him without being an example of the like to us, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
he foresaw of how il consequence it might be, to leave such an
example: therefore saith.<note place="margin">Iohn, 5. 31. 33.</note> 
               <hi>If I bear witness of my self my witness
is not true.</hi> Mens own words are no testimony in their own cause;
next let me tel them, tis so Pharisaical a trick, that though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance
it should proove true, it wil make others Judg of them as
the Gospel censures the Pharises, alwaies joyning the Name of
Hypocrites; <hi>Wo to you Scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites,</hi>

self Justification when not necessary, to vindicate a man from
some imputation laid to his charge is a common badg of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie;
and next, this (as is before mentioned) is no Justification
of a wrong. Nay 'tis a notable return that those that intrude upon
such specious holiness, unjustly, are more wicked in such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion
than all they can object to the wronged party, wil render
him guilty of: and are so, very justly disrobed of their own holy
Cloak that cover'd their covetousness. Such Boasters are very
wel resembled by the Peacock which gives a glorious shew with
his spread traine forwards, sees it himself and walks stately with
the conceit of his glorious appearance. But to them that veiw
him round; behind his Feathers are dark colord and unseemly
and his Feet black and uncomly; which is not so easily discover'd
when he gives not standers by, occasion to observe him by his
pride. If therfore these men did not so much cry up their own ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
and others Prophaneness: their imperfections might pass
less noted, but to cure such arrogancy there is no way but to let
them see the blackness of the feet they stand on, that Peacock like
they may let fal their boasting with shame; I mean to give them
a remembrance of the unjust extortion, which they conceald un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:119218:10"/>
the specious covering of reformation and zeal; for whilest
they make these gay pretences; they rob others contrary to the
Laws, foment the divisions of the Nation to the procuring of
much effusion of blood; and much more mischeif that might be
reckoned; now if they would look upon these deformities sure
they would never boast of their Saint like appearance; Tis not
for a man to boast of godliness and urge breach of Laws; or to say
they seed the flocks, that rob the true Shep-heards put in by the
Laws of the Land;<note place="margin">1 Peter, 2. 13.</note> St. <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> both give other Ruls;

but not to leave the other undone ye blind guides which strain
at a Guat and smallow a Camel.</hi> Tis not a pretence of scruple
against ceremonies, can Justifie the disobedience to the higher
powers, and the violent and illegal seizing of others mens Estates,
in which the Law Justifies them; And let me tel them it makes
not much for their Justification or Saintedness, that they were
put into possession by the Arbitrary violence of such a power,
that terminated in the Murder of the King; which without
doubt bolstred themselves with such Appendixes as should be
necessary to support them to their intended mischeif: Tis a
wonder to me with what impudence men can plead a possession
from so villanous a force, no more justifiable, by Law or reason
than any common robbery; not see I how any one that holds
any benevolence of theirs, dffers any more from their crime,
than the receiver from the Theif; (that is if they shal stand upon
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:119218:10"/>
maintaining the possession they had of them; possibly some may
have been abused by their false Glosses, but if they persevere;
their fault appears not through ignorance, but willfulness; for
the ringleaders of that treasonable Practice could give no better
title than they had, which was only Violence, and Rapine; do
not then they partake with them that shal Justifie any possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from their Title? Nay can they hope that so Free a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as this is, can make good the receipt of their roberies? No,
I perswade my selfe too many of them have felt their malice too
much, and have known their cruelty and injustice too well, to
be brought to consent to their Villanies: for they know very
well that <hi>Qui non probibet cum licet, Iubet.</hi> And I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
these men will have a greater task than <hi>Hercules</hi>'s labour,
to prevaile with so eminent an assembly, ever to justifie such
villanies; The injustice they have seen, will make them too
fearful of the like againe, to give any incouragement to what is
past: tis time at length to lay aside Private interest, and advance
the publique; which can be no way provided for but by Justice,
losses will be great enough to the loosers, do what can be done;
so long profits can never be restor'd them they belonged to; and
on the otherside, the gains will be too great to them that have
deserved far otherwise; how strictly soever they be call'd to
account; and we may be certain of this that very few of them
can be brought to a more desperate fortune that they began
withall; so that none need fear overdoing on this hand, so long
ryot upon other mens Purses and labors, together with corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
impunity is advantage enough, Nay too great for such unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
Service as they have done the Nation; therefore I
think it will be the most reasonable ples, that all sufferers can
make, that they may have Justice: and in that, their oppressors
wil not know how to oppose their desires; for to say they desire
no Justice (though it be like all former impudence of theirs)
they perhaps are yet ashamed to profess themselves enemies to it;
but if they say they desire Justice according to the Laws, then
all English men have their priviledge; and one plea will serve us
all; but by their fruits already brought forth we may partly
know what to expect for the future; and assure our selves they
will pervert the sense of the thing or slink into obscurity least
now the light of truth shines freely every where; their deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
he made more apparent, for Justice is the light and life of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:119218:11"/>
the Body Politick, and the Law the window to let that light
into all parts of that Body to discover, the actions of every man,
so that they that hate the Law hate the light, that makes their
actions appear, and it is a shrowed sign of their own conscience
accusing them if they refuse to be tryed by the Laws.<note place="margin">Iohn, 3. 20.</note> 
               <hi>For every
one that doth evil, hateth the light neither cometh to the light,
lest his deeds should be reprooved, but he that doth truth cometh
to the light, that his deeds be made manifest that they are
wrought in God?</hi> Let us therefore with alacrity think on no
other Plea than that Justice may be afforded to all alike; we
desire no more priviledg than other men have, and we desire on
the contrary they may have no more than we; and that no <hi>Post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fact
Laws</hi> may be made to the advantage of any perticular mans
interest; but that as God hath ordained from the beginning one
only truth and one Catholick Church universally dispensable to
all; so that our Nation in Imitation to his ordering of the Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
of the universe; may have one general maintainance of
his truth, by an equal and general dispensation fo the Laws,
our property rectified and secured, that once again Justice may
flourish, that so we may receive his best of temperal blessings
PEACE and Truth within our Walls and Plenteousness in our
Pallaces: So let every true English man and Loyal subject pray.</p>
