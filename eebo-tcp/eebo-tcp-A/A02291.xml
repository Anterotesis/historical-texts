         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

mislike that a Gentleman should publish the fruites of his learning, are some curious Gentlemen, vvho thynke it most commendable in a Gentleman, to cloake his arte and skill in euery thyng, and to seeme to doo all thynges of his ovvne mother vvitte as it vvere: not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering hovv vve deserue no prayse for that, vvhich God or Nature hath bestovved vpon vs, but only for that, vvhich vve purchace by our owne industry: and if you shall chaunce to enter into reasonyng with them, they wyll at the seconde woorde make protestation that they are no Schollers: whereas notwithstanding they haue spent all theyr tyme in studie. Why Gentlemen is it a shame to shewe to be that, which it is a shame not to be? In diuers thynges, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng so good as Learning. You are desirous to seeme to be that, which you are not, and in Learning, the best thyng of all others, are you afearde to shewe to be that, which you are? Alas you wyll be but vngentle Gentlemen, yf you be no Schollers: you wyll doo your Prince but simple seruice, you vvyll stande your Countrey but in slender steade, you vvyll bryng your selues but to small pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, yf you be no Schollers. Can you counsayle your Prince wysely, foresee daungers prouidently, gouerne matters of state discreetely, without Learning? no, experience must then be your guide, which wyll be but a blynde one: it must be your Scholemaister. but you shall finde it a dangerous one. To come lower, can you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with Strangers, inquire the state of forraine Countries, geue entertainement to Ambassadours, being no Schollers? no surely, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be with dum shewes and signes: lyke as of late a pleasaunt Gentleman (who could haue spoken sufficiently, yf he had been put to it) being amongst others commaunded to ryde to meete an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadoure that was commyng to the Court, at his returne a Noble man asked hym merily, what he sayd to the Ambassadoure when he met hym: nothyng (sayd he) but kist my Horses mayne, and came my way. To come lowest of all, Can you so much as tell your Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse a fine tale, or delight her with pleasant deuice, beyng vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? no it must needes eyther be altogether vnsauerie, or els sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned with the salte of others: and whether thynke you it more shame that you should shew to haue of your owne, or that she should knowe you filche from others?

Gentleman, but yet he was a Scholler, but yet he wrote Bookes, but yet he came in print. <hi>Marcus Aurelius</hi> was an Emperour, but he was learned, and set foorth learned woorkes. Therefore (Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) neuer deny your selues to be Schollers, neuer be ashamed to shewe your learnyng, confesse it, professe it, imbrace it, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor it: for it is it which honoureth you, it is only it which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth you men, it is onely it whiche maketh you Gentlemen: And marke this when you wyll, yf there be any in any place, which seeketh to come vp, or benefite hym selfe by flatterie, by bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie, by slauerie, by vallanie, I dare warrant you he is altogether vnlearned: for hauyng no good partes, no good giftes in hym which may preferre hym, he flyeth to those sinister shyftes as his surest stayes: whereby you see that it is Learnyng which accomplisheth a Gentleman, and the want of it which blemisheth hym: and that neither comlinesse of personage, neither gaynesse of garmentes, neither any exteriour Ornamentes are to be compared to the linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this I hope wyll sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie those which mislyke that Gentlemen should publishe the fruites of their studie, especially seeing thereby Learning is aduaunced, and a great number pleasured and profited: and seeing the only way to win immortalitie, is either to doo thinges woorth the writing, or to write thynges woorthy the readyng? And yf they obiecte that that seeking of immortalitie, is a signe of vayne glory: to answere them playnely and humanely, I am flat of this minde, that they which passe not of prayse, wyll neuer doo any thyng woorthy prayse. There are some others yet who wyll set lyght by my labours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I write in Englysh: and those are some nice Trauaylours, who returne home with such quaesie stomackes, that nothyng wyll downe with them but <hi>Frenche, Italian,</hi> or <hi>Spanishe,</hi> and though a woorke be but meanely written in one of those tongues, and finely translated into our Language, yet they wyll not sticke farre to preferre the Originall before the Translation: the cause is partly, for that they cannot so soone espie faultes in a forraigne Tongue
<pb facs="tcp:6169:5"/>
as in their owne, which maketh them thynke that to be curraunt, which is but course, and partly for that strange thynges doo more delyght them, then that which they are dayly vsed to: but they consider not the profite which commeth by readyng thynges in their owne Tongue, whereby they shall be able to conceiue the matter much sooner, &amp; beare it away farre better, then yf they reade it in a strange Tongue, whereby also they shall be inabled to speake, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, to write, to indite, properly, fitly, finely, and wysely, but the woorst is, they thinke that impossible to be doone in our Tongue: for they count it barren, they count it barbarous, they count it vnworthy to be accounted of: and, which is woorse, as I my selfe haue heard some of them, they report abrode, that our Countrey is barbarous, our maners rude, and our people vnciuile: and when I haue stoode with them in the comparison betweene other Countreys and ours, and poynted with my finger to many grosse abuses, vsed in the places where we haue ben, when by no reason they haue ben able to defende them, they haue shronke in their necke, and tolde me that it was the fashyon of the Countrey: not considering that the maners and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shions of eche Countrey, are the only thyng that make it counted barbarous or ciuile, good or bad. But for our Countrey, I am perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that those which know it, and loue it, wyl report it for the ciuilest Countrey in the worlde: and if it be thought to be otherwyse by strangers, the disorders of those traueylers abrode are the chiefe cause of it. And to speake but of the lyghtest, their enuying one another, their deprauing one another, their flowing one another, their falling out one with another, their fighting one with another in the open streete (as with blushyng I haue often behelde in <hi>Paris</hi>) their contemning of their Countrey fashions, their apish imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of euery outlandish Asse in their gestures, behauour, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, are the only causes that make Strangers count our Countrey and our people barbarous: for at home it is well knowne that vve liue in lawes as orderly, in maners as decently, in apparrell as co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

A degree which no doubt was due vnto him: for were it so, that he had not heretofore wonne it by meanes of his owne valour and seruice doone to the king for the space of xxii. yeeres, and namely, the day wherein fighting valiantly, being but xix. yeeres old, he was taken prisoner at the battell of S. Quintance, yet it might suffice to make him worthie of a charge so great as that, the blood which he hath shed, not eight monethes since at his returne into Fraunce amongest the enimies of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like faith, and the woundes which yet at this day put vs in some doubt of his life and recouerie. Now to returne to my purpose, I found there the gentleman my brother William, who seemed to me to be altogether changed (and yet I had seene him not past two yeeres before in Fraunce) he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come so weake, leane, and falne away, by the harde handling of a very long quartane Ague, and of other great distempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratures of his body: which as he bewailed and bewraied vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee, I could not for my life (seeing him in suche piteous case, and hearing him drawe out his wordes so softly and so weakely) keepe the teares out of my eies. For I not only loue him as a younger brother, but honor him as if hee were the eldest: but that my pitie might not make him think worse of himselfe, I foorthwith withstood my selfe, and with a more couragious countenance, I began to put him in hope that

hee might recouer his health, so soone as hee shoulde see his friendes and parents, who did earnestly looke for him, and so soone as he might haue the aduice and counsell of some good Phisition of that Citie there. Whither not long after the Duke being come to see the most excellent Princes <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> of <hi>Austria</hi> his cosen, &amp; vnderstanding the iust desire hee had to see againe our house, he was content with his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, &amp; to let him be heere for the space of sixe dayes.

And so great was the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesie of the Phisition, that not suffering my brother to take the paines to visite him, hee came the nexte day, and founde him at the Table, but newe dyned. After that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing themselues into a little closet, where I vse to haue a fewe small bookes, rather for a shewe then for studie, they there passed a great parte of the day (which they continued the three nexte dayes following) with many notable dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courses,

<pb facs="tcp:6169:10"/>
On the other side, I can assure you aswell by that you haue told me, as by certain signes which I begin to discrie in you, that your euill is easie to bée cured: for that the medicine is in your owne handes, whereby in short time you may bée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to your health. And to speake héereof more plainely, I must néedes tell you, that to exempt your selfe out of this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, you must first giue your selfe to cut of the cause and originall thereof.</p>

                  <p>I will let you know it: your euill commeth of the false imaginatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you haue, by meanes wherof, like vnto the flie which flieth about the candle, with pleasure, you pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chace your death, and in steede of consuming and staruing your euill, you giue it nourishment. For thinking to receiue solace by meanes of a solitarie life, you fill your self full of ill humors, which take roote in you, and there lie in waite rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die to search out secrete and solitarie places conformable to their nature, &amp; to flie all mirth and company: and as hidden flames by force kept downe are most ardent, so these cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt humours, couertly lurking, with more force consume, and destroy the faire pallace of your minde. And therefore I would wish that, leauing that wrong opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wherby hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto you went about, cleane contrarie, to redresse your euil, you should change your order of procéeding, &amp; to account so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarinesse for poyson, and companie, for an <hi>Antidote,</hi> and the foundation of life: and to frame your selfe to cast of solita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse as a concubine, &amp; to take companie into your fauour, as a lawfull spouse.</p>

                  <p>I haue alreadie shewed you, that the pleasure of solitarinesse (considering your comple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ion) is counterfeite, I now further prooue it to you. For the true pleasure (to speak
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6169:10"/>
humanly) is that which naturally giueth pleasure to al per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in generall. And therfore, though solitarinesse be agrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to melancholike persons, yet it is vnpleasant to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which you shall better vnderstand, if you marke howe some women with childe long to eate things which al other folke abhorre: and yet for all that we must not say that such meats are conuenient, for though they please some women, yet commonly they are displeasant to al. And when the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholike person, &amp; the woman with childe shalbe rid, the one of his false imagination, &amp; the other of her altered taste, they will haue in hate the things aboue said.</p>

But if I flatter not my selfe, I haue a whole minde within my crasy body, and my pleasure is common to other men of good taste: and though company pleaseth some, yet I knowe many of great valour and déepe vnderstanding, which cannot away with company, and loue solitarinesse so wel, as fishes doe the water: so that either I am besides my selfe, or els the definition which you haue assigned to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is besides the trueth: considering that not only conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, but diuers other pleasures, are acceptable to some, &amp; irksome to other som. As it falleth out of games, of feasts, of Musicke, and other delightes, from which a great many men flie, &amp; more willingly leane to graue matters, and these are for the most part me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of good calling, &amp; not of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon sort.</p>

                  <p>God graunt that I may neuer haue more occasion to doubt that your brain is distempered, then it euer entred into my thought to say it, &amp; if I shold say it, rather I (the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you) might be thought scarse wel in my wits: your reasons make nothing against the definition which I assigned to pleasure, but rather confirme it. For those which like not of games, musicke, Feasts, &amp; companies, haue either by long studie, &amp; great conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plation, or by som other accident, got an habite &amp; custome to be melancholik. And though in the world there be found a greater nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of these the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other, yet in this they
<pb facs="tcp:6169:11"/>
make no number, for that in these pleasures before said, they haue lost their taste by chaunce, not by nature, wheras those pleasures do delight naturally. By this same reason we are to set downe this other ground, That man, being a compag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable creature, loueth naturally the conuersation of other men, and doing the contrarie, he doth offend nature her self: for which fault many haue done penance. For som by remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning inclosed in these voluntarie prisons; become ill fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, leane, forlorne, &amp; filled full of putrified blood, by meanes whereof, their life and manners come to corruption. Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that some take after the nature of sauage beasts, some waxe couragelesse, &amp; stand in feare of their owne shadowes. I ceasse to rehearse vnto you what hath happened to diuers men, who by liuing long time in solitarinesse, haue falne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to such vehement and frantike fansies, that they haue giuen occasion to bée laughed at, and pitied. Wherfore waying the things which are to bée read in writers co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning those kind of men, and the things which I my selfe haue séene, I thinke nothing at all strange that which is reported of a poore séelie soule, who thinking himselfe to be transfourmed into a grain of Millet, for a long time durst not come foorth of his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, for feare the poultrie would eate him vp. And as it is not possible without great labour and sleight to take away the false imagination from these kind of Melancholike persons, so there are other sortes of them, that haue made themselues away by the meanes either of water, or fire, or sworde, or by throwing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues headlong from on high, or els at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of their daies, by their naturall death they haue giuen some certaine testimonie of their follie.

                  <p>I promise to imitate you so much as I may, and to fall nowe to the skirmishe: I say first, that to climbe to the true seruice of God, and the enioying of those heauenly incomprehensible and eternall benefites which he hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to his faithfull, the desartes, al by places and solitarie, are the right ladders. And contrariwise, companies are nought els but hookes and tonges, which withdrawing vs by force out of the course of our good thoughtes, set vs in the way of distruction: for that this life béeing full of suspitions, deceites, lasciuiousnesse, periuries, detractions, enuy, oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, violences, and other innumerable mischiefes, a man can not turne his eyes aside, but that he shalbe forced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde some euil thing or other, which entereth and insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it selfe by a broade way vnto the heart, where after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde are planted those venimous graftes, which growe to the destruction of the soule. The which neuer happeneth to the solitarie, who being safe from all inticements, intang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linges, and surprises, being altogether out of loue with the worlde, is whollie raised vp to the contemplation of his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall and happie state. Likewise, whosoeuer will obteine Gods assistance by his prayers, must abandon companies, and withdrawe him selfe to his chamber (for so God expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commaundeth) and therefore it is no meruell if hée were so well pleased with the deuout workes wrought especially in the wildernesse by the first fathers, <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, Moses, Helias,</hi> and <hi>Ieremie,</hi> neither ought the example of our first father to way any lesser with vs, who was as happie while hee liued in solitarinesse, as hée was after miserable and griefefull when hée was in companie. I could héere rehearse vnto you many persons, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the vanities of the worlde, &amp; Conuersation amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6169:13"/>
men, were impediments to the seruice of God, &amp; their owne saluation, haue ioyfully left their proud Palaces, their great riches, their high degrées, the companie of their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, friendes, and parents, to cloyster vp them selues in poore Monasteries, there, to ende their life in holinesse and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But if the examples alreadie recited bée of no force with you, looke vpon the doings of Christ, who being to make his prayers vnto GOD his Father, went vp to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: béeing too fast, kept him selfe solitarie, and got into desertes at the death of Iohn Baptist. Now if we wil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, besides the seruice of God, howe muche the solitarie life auaileth to our instruction and happie life, we can not but curse whether it were <hi>Saturne</hi> or <hi>Mercury,</hi> or <hi>Orphey,</hi> or <hi>Amphion,</hi> or whosoeuer it were, who gathered &amp; assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled together into one bodie, the people scattered abroade in Forrestes and Mountaines, where they followed nature in stead of lawe, not crediting the subtile persuasions of other, but their owne giltlesse conscience, and leading a loyall, simple, and innocent life, had not yet whetted their tongues to slaunder their neighbours, gaue not their mindes to cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties, neither had infected and corrupted their manners with the contagion of vices, which began to growe hot in the Cities and assemblies of men. And for that cause you sée that naturally all persons indued with knowledge and vertue (to auoyde the common sort which delighteth in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany) withdrawe them selues with great pleasure into by-places, and distant from the people, to haue leasure for their goodly and laudable contemplations. And if this be true, as no doubt it is, that the Philosophers excell all other men so farre as light doeth darknesse, it is a plaine case, that to saile surely in the déepe sea of diuine Philosophie, wée ought to take wary heede to flie, more then <hi>Scylla</hi> and <hi>Cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And
<pb facs="tcp:6169:14"/>
though it shall séeme perchance vnto you, that Conuersation and companie is naturally desired of all men, yet remember your selfe of the sentence which once you brought against me, which, if you be an indifferent iudge, ought to haue place against your selfe in the same case: which is, that a man must not make reckoning or account of the multitude of people, which either for the desire of some vaine pleasure, or vile gaine, or fickle and transitorie promotions, are alwayes in companie and Conuersation: and heerein we ought to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe the opinion of the Philosopher, who at his returne from the Bathes, being asked whether there were in them any great number of men, answered, no: and a litle after, as one asked him if there were good store of people, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, yea. Wherefore you must agrée with mée, that if Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation yéelde pleasure or profite, it is for the most part to the ignorant and carelesse, to whom solitarinesse is a kinde of torment: for that being alone they are good for nothing but to count the clocke, which they thinke goeth too slowly.

                  <p>You haue swarued nothing at all in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course from the dutie of a perfect Courtier, whose propertie it is to do all things with carefull diligence, and skilfull art: mary yet so that the art is hidden, and the whole séemeth to be doone by chaunce, that he may thereby be had in more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And so taking that course, you haue here co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended solitarinesse, partly by reasons deriued from your owne good wit, &amp; partly by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> doctirine you haue learned of some famous writers, &amp; specially of <hi>Petrarch</hi> &amp; <hi>Vida,</hi> of whose name &amp; au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie you haue made no mention, because you would hide that glorious doctrine, which some y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are learned vse to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, in hauing alwaies in their mouth the name, assoone of some Philosopher, assoone of some Poet, assoone of some Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. But yet you could not in suche sort couer this cunning, but that I perceiued it, &amp; was thereby occasioned greatly to commend your discrete iudgement. Now for that I am of a contrary opinion to yours, it standeth mée vpon to answere from point to point, to the reasons which you haue brought: whereof the first (if I be not deceiued) is grounded vpon the seruice of God &amp; our saluation, wherto in your opinion Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation is an hinderance: which truly I will not sticke to graunt you, if you bée able to prooue mée that the seruice of God is only perfourmed by the meanes of solitarinesse. But I am sure you will not denie me, that he hath left vs many commaundementes by his owne mouth, for the execution whereof, Conuersation is necessary. For you cannot goe to visite the sicke, to reléeue the poore, to correct and admonishe your brother, to comfort the afflicted, if you remain alwaies mewed vp. And therefore if you will haue solitarinesse serue to appease the wrath of GOD, and to obtaine fauour at his handes, you shoulde say that it is profitable and necessary onely for the time appointed for prayer. But for all that, I will not graunt you that it is a matter of necessitie,
<pb facs="tcp:6169:15"/>
that wée should be euer alone when wée pray, for where our Lorde saide wée should enter into our chamber to make our prayers, it was spoken onely to reprehend hypocrites, which vsed to knéele praying openly at the endes of stréetes, &amp; with their solemne and counterfeite deuotion, to make the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple returne to beholde them, to admire them, and to repute them for men of a holy life. For wée sée that GOD hath appointed the Churche for Christians to assemble in. And albeit in all places deuout and earnest prayers are accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vnto him, yet wee are bound to goe seeke him in the holy Church ordeined to that end: where, either by reason of the most holy Sacramentes, whiche are there often cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated, either by reason of the deuout prayers of others, wée are stirred vp to prayer with more feruent zeale and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Besides, we sée that the religious do not make their prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers apart, but by the ordinances of the Church they assemble togeather in one Quire: where ioyning their voyces toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they make as it were of many mindes one onely. framing a harmonie of diuine prayses and deuout praiers, for the peace of GOD, for the saluation of mankinde. And that congregation doeth not onely call men dayly from their worldly workes to diuine seruice, but besides, hath great power, and is verie acceptable in the sight of God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon some haue saide, that it is impossible, the praiers made by many together shoulde not bée graunted. Neither doeth it any thing remooue mée out of my setled opinion, the example which you propose of many, who of fleshly are become spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall, of wealthie are willingly entred into miserie, and from their stately Palaces, haue vowed themselues to beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly monasteries: for these same though they haue the name of solitarie, for that they are seuered from vs in this tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall life, yet they are gathered and assembled togeather in their Couents, where they not onely liue and pray together amongest themselues, but also vse conuersation with vs, in preaching, teaching, and doeing other thinges which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perteine to the profite of our soules. On the other side, wée secular men which haue more inticements to do amisse, must
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6169:15"/>
consider, that God hath giuen, is Roses beset with thornes, the swéete with the sower, and hath giuen vs vnderstanding to discerne their qualities &amp; difference. And though it were so that (as you say) a man can neither sée nor heare the thing, which maketh not the right way to saluation rugged &amp; vnea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, yet for all that, a good Christian ought not to stray out of it, but to haue in minde this saying, <hi>That euerie commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, bringeth with it a discommoditie.</hi> And when hée seeth him selfe assailed either with the temptation of pleasures, or the vexation of troubles, then is the time to get the garland, by breaking in sunder those hookes, and holdbacks you spake of but now, for you know we must enter into the kingdome of heauen through tribulations &amp; troubles. And although hée do wisely, who, to fly the combat of the fleshe against the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, retireth into some obscure &amp; solitarie place, yet co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider the great vertue &amp; singular merite of him, who being placed in the midst of pleasures, forbeareth them, &amp; maketh a conquest of him selfe: &amp; think also with your selfe, how curious these solitary men are of their quiet, who wil neither sée nor heare the plaintes of other, neither are partakers of our losse and hurts, neither are subiect to the iniuries, the threates, the blowes, the persecutions, the outrages, daungers, &amp; ruines, which this poore vale of miserie is full of. Neither likewise doth the example of those first fathers make against me, who were not so giuen to solitarinesse, but that they had a care o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their neighbors, which they manifested by more workes then you haue néed to heare, or I leasure to count. I deny not but <hi>Adam</hi> was happie, while he liued in solitarinesse, but for all that, you do not perceiue, that God in giuing him compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, ment also to shew vnto vs, that Conuersation liked him wel. The last example of Christ co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teines in it a hidden mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, different fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the doings of men, for in praying, fasting, and mourning in the wildernesse, his meaning was, if I bee not deceiued, to let a Christia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> know, that to reape the fruites of those labours, it behooueth him to solitary him selfe from sin: &amp; calling his wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dring mind to this reckoning, it behoueth him to kéepe it solitarie from al other thoughtes. For if with
<pb facs="tcp:6169:16"/>
the sadnesse of the countenance, the fasting of the body, and the prayers of the mouth, the heart neither prayeth, fasteth, nor mourneth, Christ is not imitated, but it is the act of an hypocrite, who as the Poet saieth, couereth his conceits with a contrarie cloake. And if besides these woorkes of Christ hée had not béen conuersable, it had not gone well with vs: for that disputing, preaching, healing the sicke, making the blinde to sée, raysing the dead to life, hée was conuersant amongst vs, the space of so many yéeres, with so many discommodities: and in the ende shed his innocent blood for our redemptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. Séeing then while hée liued amongst vs, hée left vs an example and way, which wée ought to vse in conuersation, in my opinion you were to blame to curse him, who first with so great discretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gathered together the scattered people, which had not (I confesse) the knowledge of vices which raigne in cities and townes, marry no more had they the knowledge of sciences, of honest and ciuile behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, of friendship, of handicrafts, of woorkemanships, by meanes whereof they made themselues differ from sauadge beasts, whom before they did resemble. And therfore it may iustly bée saide, that who so leaueth the ciuile society to place himselfe in some solitarie desert, taketh as it were the forme of a beast, and in a certaine manner putteth vppon him selfe a brutishe nature. So the common saying is, that there is no other name méete for a solitarie person, but either of a beast, or a tyrant. For that hée doeth violence to beasts, seasing and possessing himselfe of forrests, of tops of mountaines, of their dennes, caues, and blinde aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings: Not séeing that the citie and assemblies of people are made to founde the temple of iustice, and to appoint a law and forme to mans life, which before was disordered, &amp; imperfect. You adde afterward, that learned men, and those of good wits, make no account but of the solitarie life, and you bring forth the philosophers, comtemners of the multitude, and louers of solitarinesse. I might heere take large scope to make you answere, but vsing al the briefnesse I can, I say only, that those excellent men in learning and science loue so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:6169:16"/>
places not by nature, but for lacke of their like, with whom they may be conuersant: and I graunt you that there is nothing more displeasant to the learned, then the companie of the ignorant: which falleth out of the great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie and difference which is betwéene them. But as the learned flye the ignorant, so they willingly séeke the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of other that are learned, with whom, stirred by a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vertuous ambition, they make proofe of their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, giuing and taking of the fruites which they haue ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered with long trauaile. You can not name mée any Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher so hard laced, and so rebellious against nature, who, when time and place serued, had not conuersation eyther with his schollers to teache, or with other Philosophers to reason, and to heare their reasons, and which was not desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to haue others followers of his doctrine. And therfore the doing of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> which you haue rehearsed, serued wel to shewe, that a Philosopher is contrary to the multitude, but not to disallowe conuersation, which hée more accounted of then other Philosophers did. Wherefore I conclude, that if the learned and students loue solitarinesse for lacke of their like, yet they naturally loue the companie of those which are their like: In so much that many of them haue trauailed farre with great labour, to speake with other learned men, whose bookes they had at home in their hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. And though you alledge vnto me, of these, which haue refused promotions, and publike offices, thinking it a thing blameworthy to bring their frée minde into bondage, and to intangle it with the affaires of the worlde, yet there haue béen other excellent Philosophers, who by their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings (which are yet extant) haue reprooued the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of those aforesaide, and that not without great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: for giuing themselues wholy to the studie of the scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and contemplation, they altogether abandoned those persons, to whom by the Lawe of nature they were bounde to giue succour, and considered not that (man being borne not onely for himselfe, but for his Countrie,
<pb facs="tcp:6169:17"/>
parents and friends) hée séemeth either too farre in loue with him selfe, or too farre out of loue with others, which followeth not his proper nature to benefite others, béeing borne thervnto. And therefore this sentence is well woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to bée written in letters of golde, that Hee vtterly séeketh his owne shame, who onely seeketh his owne pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite. Nowe if all the prayse of vertue consist in dooing, according to the opinion of the Philosophers, whereto serueth this dumbe and ydle Philosophie, whereof may bée saide as of fayth, that without woorkes it is dead, and profiteth no body, no not so much as to him who hath gotten it? Who can not assure him selfe to haue learned any science, if hée make it not knowen, and if hée per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue not that others which are learned allowe of it. And thereof commeth the prouerbe, <hi>Betweene treasure buried vnder the ground, and wisedom kept hidden in the heart, there is no difference at all.</hi> And it may bée said that these same men resemble the couetous, which possesse treasure, but haue it not: and that they are greatly to blame, which knowing howe to doe well, doe it not. For as Musicke, which is not hearde, is not had in estimation: so that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losopher meriteth no honour, which manifesteth not his knowledge. * Which <hi>Socrates</hi> knew very wel, who, though no way else hée had deserued to bée counted the wisest man of the world, yet he deserued it only for this, that he was the first which brought moral philosophy down fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> heauen. For séeing al the Philosophers bent to the conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>platio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of nature, hée not only framed himselfe to get wisdome, to liue wel, &amp; to teach other to liue, but gaue himselfe altogether to the bringing to perfection this part of Philosophie, which is so profitable and necessarie to our common life, and made the worlde to sée the open folly of those, who will rather hide a candel vnder a bushell, then set it on a Candlesticke. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides you knowe that these which like not of companie, howe learned soeuer they bée, take them from their schoole points, and matters of learning, shewe themselues
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:6169:17"/>
so insufficient and such beastly fooles that most commonly they giue occasion to euery man to laugh at them. I haue not yet forgotten many grosse follies of a Gentleman sometyme my Schoolefellowe at <hi>Pad.</hi> who in learning was not inferiour to any scholler in the Uniuersitie, but for the rest, you woulde haue sayde, that hée had béen one of these Owles who stande in feare of other byrds: in so much that his sottishnesse mooued mée to pitie him, especially one day, that hauing occasion to ride by hearing of the sodayne death of his father, hée bought a paire of Bootes, whereof the one was so straite that it wroong his legge and foote very sore, and the other was a great way to wide: And as wée blamed him that hée woulde suffer him selfe so to bée coose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: hée answered, That hée him selfe when hee bought his Bootes founde fault that there was suche oddes betwéene them, but the shoemaker had sworne vnto him that the greatest Boote was made of such leather as woulde shrinke in the wearing, and the other, of a hyde that woulde so retch, that in lesse then twoo dayes it woulde bée easier then the other: what say you of this? Doe you not thinke that these men may bée called wise by learning, and fooles in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of the common people. Therefore it was rightly saide of an ancient Poet, that experience is the father of wisedom, and memorie the mother, to shew, that it is néedeful for him which wil attaine to the knowledge of humane thinges, not only to be prouided of bookes, but besides, to haue vndoubted experience &amp; practise touching the vnderstanding of thinges: which béeing knowen, ought to be receiued &amp; kept in minde, thereby to be able afterwarde to giue him selfe counsaile, by the triall him selfe hath alredie made, and to guide him selfe and aide other, by the euents hée hath before noted to haue followed of like causes. And if you will knowe that this is true, consider that not onely in the profession of vs Phisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but in other faculties likewise, speculation without practise is nothing certaine. But wée giue more credite to an argument grounded on thinges, which wee haue tried by reason, then in the simple Doctrine of other.</p>

And therefore to shewe the valour and wisedome of great <hi>Vlisses,</hi> with good reason it was saide to his immortall praise,
<q>
                        <l>That many countries he had seene,</l>

                  <p>I thinke I haue sufficiently confuted your reasons, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out I should force or straine my selfe, as I could very well, to make you a more peremptorie and waightie answere, which I will leaue to doe, thinking you are content with this, and that you haue spoken of this matter, rather to giue me to vnderstand your great wit, then to maintaine in good earnest this opinion: For the same which haue taught you this false doctrine, haue likewise taught you the true, and I am sure you are not ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that <hi>Petrarch,</hi> notwithstanding all the prayses he attributeth to the solitary life, was not to learne, that without Conuersation our life woulde bée de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectuous. For hée hath béen no such enemie to good company, but that these wordes haue escaped forth of his mouth,

                  </p>
                  <p>But that he hath frequented Courts, and entred into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie with many Princes and Gentlemen, I speake not of <hi>Hierosme Vida,</hi> for that not so much in respect of the workes hée hath written, being gotten alone by himselfe, as for the learning hee shewed by word of mouth in publike counsaile: and for that hée had long time vsed the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and by his déedes giuen other good example to doe well, he hath gotten not onely the myter, vnder which hée hath a great while gouerned the flocke committed vnto him, but besides, hath wonne the credite of a Prelate worthy of a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grée. Moreouer, that hée exalteth the solitary life, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to shewe his great wit, in debasing it afterwards with diuers and inuincible reasons: amongst the which he affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:6169:18"/>
that all beasts so soone as they are deliuered from their damme get vpon their féet, and are able to stand a high alon, which nature woulde not graunt to man, who, so soone as hée is borne, néedeth the assistance and support of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. If that reason bée not sufficient, hée addeth, that the same nature hath giuen speeche to man, not to the ende to speake to himselfe, which were to no purpose, but to the ende it might stande in steede towardes other. And you sée that the tongue serueth vs to teache, to demaunde, to conferre, to traffike, to counsaile, to correct, to dispute, to iudge, and to expresse the affection of our hearte: meanes whereby men come to loue one another, and to linke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues together. And hée concludeth at the end, that a man can not attaine to any science, if it bée not taught him by some other. You sée then (Gentleman) that conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not onely profitable, but moreouer necessary to the perfection of man, who must confesse that hee is lyke the Bée which cannot liue alone. And therefore accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the graue opinion of the <hi>Stoikes,</hi> we must thinke that as all thinges vppon the earth are made for the vse of man, so man is created for the vse of man, to the intent that following nature as their guide and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stres, they haue to succour one another, to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate together common profites, in giuing and receiuing, vniting and binding themselues together by artes, occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations, and faculties: so that hee may repute himselfe an vnfortunate man, which hath not the meanes by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation to purchase his owne profite and other mens: a punishement inflicted by the lawes on some offendors for a kinde of torment. For there is no greater affliction then to liue amongst men, and to bée depriued of the ayde and companie of men. And to ende my talke, there is héere on earth no pleasure to bee receiued without companie, which made <hi>Architas Tarentinus</hi> to say that if any might by Gods permission ascend to heauen, and there beholde the nature of the world, and the beautie of the starres, that sight woulde

                  <p>For notwithstanding I féele my selfe greafly comforted with your gentle discourse, yet there sticke in my stomacke some doubts, which make me say vnto you, that as the step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother by extreeme hatred discerneth not the vertues of her sonne in law, &amp; the mother by excessiue loue on the contrary side knoweth not the imperfections of her own sonne so you likewise shew your selfe to be surprised with the same passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to find fault with solitarinesse, &amp; commend conuersatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for so much as you haue not told the good which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> solitary life, nor the euill which commeth of conuersation. Wherefore to manifest and discouer that which you kéepe secret, I say vnto you, that my meaning was not to defende and commend those persons, who, moued either by some so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine toy which taketh them in the head or of some melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly humor, rather then of any good minde, doe altogether withdrawe themselues into solitary places, and take no keepe to knowe what wée doe in the worlde: but I amount them for dead, or at least for men which are good neither for themselues nor other: and being not willing to put in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise their vertue to their owne profite, nor to teache it to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which stande in n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And for proofe thereof, you sée howe those which busie themselues in the affaires of the worlde, are for the most parte without learning, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise, those which couet to get learning, seeke it not in publike places amongest a multitude of men, but in their studies &amp; priuie Chambers. Neither is it to purpose to say, that some learned, waxe sots and fooles in company, for that this foolishnesse is estéemed to bée so, onely by the vulgar sorte, who, séeing them vnskilful howe to make courtesie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the newe fashion, howe to set the cappe aside; howe to daunce in measure, and kéepe time with the musike, and howe to stoute another finely, according to the common fashion, laugheth them to scorne and maketh small recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them: But for all that, they are fauoured and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red amongst other learned men, who take for plainnesse of manners and gentlenesse of minde, that which the common so<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>
                        <l>If Virgil and Homer had seene,</l>
                        <l>Horace alone gainst all Tuscane:</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wherevpon they fell to laughing more hartily, then the schollers your friends did for the iest of the bootes: and the laughter begunne afresh after, when being required to shew the meaning of <hi>Petrarch</hi> in those verses, hée added, that hée meant to say that neither <hi>Virgil</hi> nor <hi>Homer,</hi> nor all the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets
<pb facs="tcp:6169:20"/>
of <hi>Tuscane</hi> were able to incounter <hi>Horace</hi> alone. Nowe if the scholler fell into a certaine tollerable lightnesse of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, this fellowe stumbled vpon a corrupt persuasion in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. Whereby I am induced to thinke that learning without experience is more certaine, then experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce without learning, and I had rather haue the name of a simple schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, then of an ignorant Courtier. Wherevpon I wil infer, that whosoeuer will attaine knowledge, and sounde the depth of it, must (as the artificers say) sée to the shoppe, and not walke the stréetes all the day long, and braue it out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the people. But put the case that many commendable effects come of conuersation, yet put the discommendable in ballance against them, and they will ouerway them a great deale. For that the number of the good is so smal and scant, that though you be neuer so well giuen, you cannot continue so, but you shalbe driuen to change, and to thinke with your selfe that hée which sléepeth with the dogs, must rise with the flées. And hereof the <hi>Crerensians</hi> being assured, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they wished ill to any, they forspake him that he should take delight in haunting ill companie, meaning, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee shoulde come to confusion. Besides that wée are now growen to this point that you can not behaue your selfe so well, but that you shall receiue thousand iniuries, if not in life (which is not it selfe very safely warranted) yet at least in good name. And at this day the malice of men is so great, that they spare not the honour of whosoeuer it bee, whether Prince or priuate person, and thinke smisterly and preposterously of all the good déedes which are wrought: in such sorte that if you addict your selfe to deuotion, and the exercise of charitie, you are taken for an hypocrite. If you be affable and courteous, you shalbe called a flatterer. If you succour any desolate widowe, you shall by and by heare a voice which saith: I knowe what foloweth. If through héed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesnesse you resolute not a friend, hee will speake no more to you. If you defend one that is oppressed, take héede you bee not taken out of your house at vndue tyme. Thinke not to be spared for that you make not profession of a souldiour: for

now they wil not stick to beate euen doctors and aduocates, to hinder them from defending their clyents.

                  <p>You shall bée then taken in your owne net, sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by these words you graunt vnto me, that the beginning and end of learning dependeth of conuersation. And verily as the armourer can not assure him selfe of the goodnesse of a corselet, vntill such time as he hath séene it prooued with the launce or harquebouse: so neither can a learned man assure him selfe of his learning, vntill he méete with other learned men, and by discoursing and reasoning with them, bée acer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of his sufficiencie. Whereby it séemeth to me verie cléere, that conuersation is the beginning and end of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. But for that you adde, that men conuersant in the Court and common wealth are voide of learning, I must put you in minde touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> point, that as there are diuers sciences, artes, &amp; professions, so likewise is the life of men di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, who as it pleaseth god, are called some to merchandise, some to warfare, some to phisicke, some to the lawes. And for that all these tend to one ende, to get by these meanes ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and profite, you sée that euery one of these diuideth his life into two partes: the one, to learne those thinges which may serue to lead him to the end I haue spoken of the other,
<pb facs="tcp:6169:21"/>
to put them in practise. And for example, you haue alredie purposed with your selfe to bée Secretarie to a Prince, I am not ignorant, that by reason of the good partes which are in you, you are to looke for reputation and commoditie therby, and to bethinke you of the good hap of those, who from that degrée haue béen raysed to Cardinals and Uicars of Christ. And therefore to make your selfe fit for that office, you haue learned the Latin and <hi>Tuscane</hi> tongue, and so many arts as are necessarie for that purpose: and by your perfect style in wryting, &amp; great discretion in handling matters, you haue wonne the reporte and name of an excellent Secretarie. All other men doe the like, amongest whom there are some, who giuing their mindes either to husbandry, or to merchandise, care for no more learning, but to reade, wryte, and cast a count. And albeit amongst learned men, these same are not able to discourse of Rhetorike or of Poetry, yet are they not therefore to bee blamed, neither may wée say they are berea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the knowledge of good letters by reason of conuersation, for that from the keginning of their life they haue determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not to meddle with studie, and it sufficeth them to bée e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stéemed wise, and well séene in their owne profession. But a scholler is well worthy to be laughed at, and reprooued, who applying him selfe altogether to studie, doeth not frame his learning to the common life, but sheweth him selfe altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant of the affaires of the world. And I will say vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you moreouer, that it were a great errour to beléeue, that learning is more gotten in solitarinesse amongest Bookes, then in the companie of learned men. For this is a maxime in Philosophy, and experience sheweth it, That learning is easilier gotten by the eares then by the eyes: neither should a man neede to dimme his sight, and weare his fingers in turning ouer the bookes of wryters, if hée might alwayes sée them present, and receiue by hearing that natural voyce, which by wonderfull force imprinteth it selfe in the minde. Besides that, if you chaunce to reade some harde and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure place, you can not intreate the booke to expounde it vnto you, but you shalbe fayne sometime to goe your way
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:6169:21"/>
from it vnco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tented, saying, If thou wilt not be vnderstood, I wil not vnderstande thée. Whereby you may knowe that it is much better to talke with the liuing, than with the dead. Againe I note this, that the spirite of a solitarie man waxeth dul &amp; lither, hauing none to stirre it vp &amp; awake it in demanding some question touching his learning, and in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it: or else he waxeth hautie &amp; proude by vaine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, for not comparing any with himselfe, hee attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth too much to himself. On the contrary side, he which hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth other to commend his studies, hath them in more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: hee which is reprehended, amendeth his faultes: hee which is any thing negligent, is pricked forwarde by his cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuals which séeke to outgoe him in glory. And as hee thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it a great shame to come behind his equals, so doeth hee count it a great honour to bee able to goe before his betters. But aboue al other things the commendable controuersies which arise amongst learned men haue most force to quicken the spirits. For by disputing they learne, &amp; that which they learne in that manner, they vnderstande best, they expounde best, and remember best. And while they dispute by liuely reasons, indeuouring to get the vpper hand ech of other, the perfect knowledge of things is come by, &amp; thervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly saide that Disputation is the sifter out of the trueth. And for so much as the trueth is taken fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent &amp; opinions of men, those opinions can not be knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but by conuersation and companie, which the Poets meant to shew and infer, reporting that though <hi>Iupiter</hi> was God om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent, yet he called the other gods to counsaile, and heard their opinions. But let vs set fables aside, doe we not knowe that the waighty &amp; wonderful institutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the holy church procéede not from the Pope onely, but from the holy general counsailes where they haue bin discréetly wayed, &amp; allowed? Besides, is it not the fashio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of al princes, where there is que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion of the affaires of their estates, because they wil doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their owne heads, to assemble their counsailours, &amp; to determine matters according to their aduise? Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weales, Cities, yea smal townes, do they not assemble toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="tcp:6169:22"/>
to choose officers, &amp; to establish orders by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent? Is it not the vse of Magistrates to take the common aduise and opinion of their assistentes, and we phisitions do we not the like in our assemblies &amp; Colledges, wherein wee take resolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> touching the healing of the sicke, by the aduise and iudgement of the greater part? Did not <hi>Apelles</hi> take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to set his pictures abroade, &amp; to throud himself secretly néere vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to heare the opinion of the beholders, &amp; when many were of one mind in reprehending some part, did not hee mend it according to the common voices and opinions? * And did not another painter say, that the people was the maister of whom he had learned his art? * And lastly, was it not the vse of a wise Emperour (whose name I now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not) to send spies abroade euery day, to harke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> what was said of him, altering somtimes vpon that occasion his maner of dealings, and reforming his life from good to better, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the reports were made vnto him? Uerily, he hazar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth too much, who reposeth himselfe in his own iudgement. And it is a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon saying, that he doth wel, which cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sayleth himselfe wel: For which cause counsel is estéemed for a holy thing. I am not able sufficiently to expresse the great good, which commeth of conuersatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treth in by the eares &amp; sinketh into the mind, comming from the mouth of learned men. But I wil tel &amp; remember you of the honorable Academies, or Uniuersities, which for that purpose haue been instituted in many cities of <hi>Ialy,</hi> amongst which we must not forget to speake of that in <hi>Mantua,</hi> fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the house of the most famous Lord <hi>Caesar Genzaga,</hi> a mightie prince, and a special patrone of learned men: neither that in <hi>Pauia,</hi> which flourisheth prosperously, by reason of the great nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of students. But perchance it is a thing to be meruailed at, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> in that litle citie of <hi>Casal</hi> the Academie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> 
                     <hi>Illustrati</hi> maketh so galla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t a shew. But for that the time ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not to speake of the excellencie therof, to returne to the matter in question, I say, that the fruite which is gathered by these Academies, is inestimable, and that they know wel what they do, which haue any doings in them. For knowing that one alone cannot of himselfe attaine to many sciences,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:6169:22"/>
for that an art is long, and life is short, there they may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine whatsoeuer they desire. For some discoursing of diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, some of humanitie, some of Philosophy, some of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and other diuers matters, they partake mutually &amp; in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, of that which euery one priuately with great paine &amp; long study hath learned: by the example of those, who béeing not able to liue of themselues, &amp; make good cheere at their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, méet together with other of their neighbors in one place, &amp; bring euery one their cates with them, and thereof make a suptuous feast. And therfore it hath bin very profondly said, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> man is a god vnto ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for that one receiueth so great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure and comfort of another. Which selfe thing is represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto vs by the picture of the blinde man, carying vppon his backe the lame créeple, who teacheth him the way: and thervpon wel saith, <hi>Almanni.</hi>

                  <p>I say then againe, that conuersation is the full perfection of learning, and that it more auayleth a student to discourse one houre with his like, then to studie a whole day by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his studie. Yea and in conferring with his compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if he haue vnderstood any thing amisse, he therby most commonly commeth to the right meaning of the matter, &amp; cléereth his minde of many errours, * and beginneth to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that the iudgement of one alone may bee easily darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with the veile of ignorance, or of some passion, and that amongst a multitude, it seldome falleth out that all are blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: and finally, vpon proofe he knoweth that vertue &amp; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge set foorth in bookes, is naught else then a painted ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: and that true vertue and learning, is gotten rather by practise then by reading. * But it is nowe time to answere you, touching the inconueniences which are incurred (as you say) by conuersa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And though in my fancie you might satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie your self with some reasons alreadie alledged, yet I will say further y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is true, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as some diseases of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> body are infec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tious, so y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vices of the minde take fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one to another, so that

a drunkard draweth his companions to loue wine, a Carpet knight corrupteth &amp; effeminateth a valiant man: &amp; so much force hath co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual conuersation, that oft times against our wils, we imitate the vices of others. Therevpon it is saide, that the friends and familiers of <hi>Aristotle</hi> had learned to stammer: the friends of <hi>Alexander</hi> in discoursing, had got his roughnesse of spéech: and dout not, but in haunting the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of the euil, a man shal find by experience that a man is a woolfe to a man, not a God as I said before, &amp; y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> according to the prouerbe, A friend of fooles wil become like vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, * &amp; hee which toucheth pitch shalbe defiled therwith. * But in like case also, &amp; by the same reason on the contrary side, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue bringeth forth the like effect. * And as a dead coale, laied to a liuely, kindleth: so a naughty person meeting in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie with the good, partaketh with their conditions. * Neither is a good aire &amp; a mans owne natiue soile more helpeful to the health of the body, then the conuersation &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good is to diseased minds. For if the ill leaue some séede of their naughtines with those that cleaue to them, by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the good leaue behinde of their goodnesse, with those that frequent them.

Besides, you must co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider whether being withdrawne from company, and leading a solitarie life, you shall liue in securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and be exempt from the iniuries of the wicked.

For some one will not sticke to say (and perchance with some litle likelihood) that you haue about you some fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy disease, or that you haue committed some offence, and that you flye the light like a réeremouse: others wil say, that you are an heretike, for that you eschue the company of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, and they will seeke to put you into the Inquisition: others will call you an <hi>Alcumist,</hi> or a forger of money: and if all these suspicions aforesaid faile, yet at least you shal bée thought either fainte hearted, either stately, either fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, either melancholike, or els a bruite beast: for that all these most commonly flye the company of men.

Which, one <hi>Crates</hi> rightly signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, who séeing a young man walke in a secrete place, asked him what hée did there so alone: the young man answered, that he talked with him selfe: I pray you (saieth hée) take héede you talke not with some naughtie fellow. What shall I say more? But that the hearbe <hi>Helleborum</hi> may be giuen as well to the solitary, as to the foole. And whosoeuer shall marke these reasons, and specially the Etymologie of this worde <hi>Homo,</hi> (which in the Gréeke tongue as some lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned writers thinke) signifieth (together) shall perceiue, that a man can not be a right man without Conuersation. For he that vseth not company hath no experience, he that hath no experience, hath no iudgement, &amp; hee that hath no iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is no better then a beast.</p>

And yet for all that, I sée not how that may be granted vnto you, for that there are some times wherin solitarinesse is not only auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but necessary, both to the inward and outward welfare and prosperous state of life, so that I thinke it méet to make

                  <p>I wil explane them to you, &amp; first I say, ther is one sort of solitarinesse so rare &amp; perfect, that it is alwayes w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out company &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersation, not at certain times: * whereinto it pleaseth some deuout men to enter, where being dead alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the world, chosing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> best part &amp; liuing alone (if they may be said to be alone which be with God) they ende their daies most pleasantly, in a life most vnpleasant. * And this ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> no man attain vnto, without y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> special gift of god, &amp; who that otherwise hazardeth to enter into it, exposeth him selfe to a great danger touching his own safegard, &amp; hath no respect to this sente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, Wo be to the lone man, who whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he shalbe fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len downe, shall haue none to helpe him vp. I will make no larger spéech of this high kind of solitarinesse, referring my selfe to the long discourses which the diuines make of it, but descending to that lesse perfect solitarinesse, which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of Conuersation but for a certaine time. I finde ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of thrée kindes, to wit, solitarinesse of time, of place, &amp; of the minde. Solitarinesse of time, is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> stilnesse of the night, or the
<pb facs="tcp:6169:25"/>
instant wherein one speaketh alone in the presence of many: and this solitarinesse is (as you may iudge) no les profitable then necessarie to al sorts of persons, by reason of the things which are learned by word of mouth, as well of readers as of Preachers, and it is (as I saide before) of greater force and efficacy then the bookes and writings of Authours. Next, so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarinesse of place, is the chamber or priuat dwelling which euerie one chooseth of purpose to sequester him selfe from the companie and conuersation of others. Here we haue to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider that men settle themselues in this solitarinesse of place for diuers respects, some to the intent to raise their thoughts from worldly vanities to the contemplation of God and his wonderful workes, to the ende to ioyne themselues to him with incredible ioy and health of soule, * and to comprehende that in minde which they cannot see with eye: * some to get with studie &amp; speculation the fruit of learning, some to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with them selues publike or priuate affaires. Al these solitarinesses of place taken &amp; vsed in due season, haue great force to stir vp the spirits, &amp; to prepare them a more easie and sure addresse to the works and actions belonging to conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>satio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. * And if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider diligently the fable of <hi>Prometheus, Iupiters</hi> Ambassador vpon the Mount <hi>Caucasus,</hi> &amp; his heart torne by the Egle, we shall finde that by the Mount is figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto vs solitarinesse, &amp; by the Egle co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>templation, which woundeth the heart, &amp; preyeth vpon it. Neither is any thing els ment by the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction of the Moone with <hi>Endymion,</hi> but that he spent many nights in the contemplation of heauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, whereby he gathered the fruite of Astrologie. And the shoulders of <hi>Atlas</hi> wherewith he staied vp heauen, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vnto vs nothing els but the knowledge which he had of the superiour world by meanes of contemplation: * but these same notwithstanding they are solitary in respect of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> place where they remain alone, yet they are in company in respect of the diuersitie of things which they ponder in their minde. And thervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                     <hi>Scipio</hi> said, that he was neuer lesse alone, then when he was alone, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> being gotten by him self into some
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:6169:25"/>
solitarie place, he discoursed many thinges in his minde, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining to the increase of his honour. But I must tell you, that as this solitarinesse is profitable and necessarie for the disposition of the minde, so verie often is it hurtfull to the health of the bodie: and it is therefore I tolde you at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of our talke, that you ought to auoyde it. For the finer wit a man is of, the more he beateth it (being alone) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout nice and intricate pointes, whereby his bodie may bée brought into diuers dangerous diseases. Neither for all this will I affirme that this solitarinesse of place is chosen of all, to bestow them selues in laudable studies, and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable speculations, for that there are some who hauing in their handes all day long bookes full of naughtinesse &amp; leude examples, roote and inure them selues in this doctrine, and make an ordinarie practise of it: insomuch that these ill di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sposed persons may well say that they haue learned more naughtinesse béeing by them selues, then they should haue done béeing alwayes in companie in publike and frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted places: but God bée praysed, and the prouidence of our auncestours, who haue iustly condemned to the fire, all such workes, so soone as they are published, as instruments to all leaude and naughtie purposes. I must also tel you, that there are some choose solitarinesse through lazinesse of minde, and lazinesse of bodie, to the intent to rid their handes of the trauelles, affaires, and woorkes whiche they ought to vndertake for their owne behoofe and other mens. And these lurke loytringly plunged in delicacies, wherein they conserue them selues, not as Muske in a boxe, but as Swine in the mire. So that it may bée saide, that their soule is giuen to their bodie in stead of salt, least they should smell. I haue knowne some of these idle merchauntes to withdrawe them selues from companie most parte of the day, taking pleasure to doe nothing, vnlesse it were to presse downe their beds with the peise of their vnwildie bodies: and yet (such is their impudencie) they will make men beléeue that they haue employed
<pb facs="tcp:6169:26"/>
all the time in reading some good thing or other. I neuer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde these fellowes, but that I excuse and holde well with the Emperour <hi>Domitian,</hi> who taking. delight to thrust thorowe flies with the point of his dagger, did at least some exercise, and liked better to take paines to kil flies, then to suffer his minde to be corrupted with idlenesse. And if not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding hee were to be blamed for this, it was not so much for the trifling exercise, as for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he left vndon weightie matters agréeable to his greatnesse, &amp; auaileable to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of his Empire. * And heereof we haue to conclude, that euen as he which abandoneth the actiue life, to embrace the contemplatiue, meriteth praise: so he, which being in the actiue life refuseth companie, not vpon any honest occasion, but either for the hate he beareth to men, either through lazy slouthfulnesse, either through distrust in him selfe, or for some other defect, shrinketh aside into solitarinesse is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be reprehended. * But there is enough said touching so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarinesse of place, it remayneth nowe to speake of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litarinesse of minde, which is, when one is present in person amongst many others, and yet is absent in minde &amp; thought. Like as a Philosopher was, to whom a babbling foole, after a long and wearisome discourse, saide, Sir, perchaunce I trouble you with to muche talke: no verily, not a whit (saith he) for that I gaue no eare to you.</p>

                  <p>But returning to the solitarinesse of the mind, I woulde haue a wise man enter into it when he is in the company of the euil: fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hearing whose talke hee ought to stop his eares, as <hi>Vlisses</hi> did against the song of the Marmaides * and to walke amongst them (as the saying is) shood amongest the thornes. * And as wee lef not to take a iourney for a little raine or snowe, but make prouision so well as wee may for apparell to defende vs against the ill weather, so wee must not foreslow the pilgrimage of the ordinary life, for the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance of the naughty, but arme our selues with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uincible minde against the euill dispositions of other, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>too wée ought not any thing at all to yéelde. And for that I tolde you I woulde make mention likewise of <hi>Diogenes,</hi> I will declare vnto you the witty answeres which hée made touching this purpose: amongest others, as one reprooued him for that hee vsed the companie of lewde and naughtie persons, The Sunne (sayth hee) shyneth and spreadeth it beames on vncleane places, and yet neuer defileth it selfe. And as another reproched him for the like, hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, The Phisitions are all day with the sicke, and yet
<pb facs="tcp:6169:27"/>
are not infected: and in trueth ill conditions take no holde of an honest minde, and a vertuous man wareth not woorse for being in companie with the wicked * who haue no pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ouer him. For that in vaine (as the Prouerb sayth) <hi>The net is pitcht in the sight of the birdes</hi> * in so much that bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongest them, he maketh account he is not there, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the saying of the Gentleman, to whom as <hi>Esope</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, being in his studie, there came a countrie fellow, who as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him how he could liue so alone? To whom hee answered, I began to be alone, but euen since your comming hither: Meaning to shewe that a learned man is then alone, when he is amongest the ignoraunt, from whom hee is deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in minde. But it is nowe time to leaue spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of this matter, for that you vnderstand what manner of solitarinesse is profitable and necessary, and in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it is sometimes to be vsed in companie.</p>

Then the particularities of conuersation being knowne for the most part to men of meane vnderstanding, I should do you wrong, &amp; should thinke my self to speake su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluously (yea, euen when I should speak to those ignorant and vnskilfull fellowes) if I should intreate of things so or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie and common.

                  <p>Uerily, I sée by this time that as well for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie of matters which occurre in conuersation, as for the difference of the life &amp; manners of men, with whom we are conuersant, you shall take vpon you a trauell &amp; charge farre greater than the twelue labors of <hi>Hercules,</hi> throughly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate of it.

<pb facs="tcp:6169:28"/>
which is betwéene one kind and another, but to that also which is betwéene persons of one onely kinde: for not onely young men differ in behauiour from olde, and Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from Yomen: but euen young men amongest them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues differ, as also one olde man differeth in behauiour from another olde man, and one Gentleman from another Gentleman.</p>

                  <p>For that these two names, Good, and Indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent serue not to expresse fully that sorte of men whiche I meane: and to shewe it you more plainely, I wil giue you an instance of healthy men, which are properly those, who haue the foure humours so equally tempered in them, and the simple partes which come of them (besides the other partes which wee call compounde, or instrumentall, whiche are the very members of the body) so wel proportioned, that one thing excéede not another in it iust measure: and this health is graunted either neuer, or very seldome, and that to a fewe persons. But for all that, wée commonly tearme those healthfull, who though they bée not of so perfect a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of body, are able to liue, yea, and to labour too, the most part of their time, without any going to Phisicke: and (to bée short) who holde more of the whole then of the sicke. So likewise when I name the good, I meane not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that excellencie of goodnesse, which is not any way imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and which is in a manner as rare on earth as the <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix</hi>: but I include in that number, all those which are well reported and reputed of in the world, and which approch so néere as they can to that excellencie before spoken of. In like case, when I saide indifferent, I meant not that they are halfe good, and halfe euill, * neither as a certaine Historian taketh it, who speaking of the Emperour <hi>Galba,</hi> tearmeth his disposition indifferent, for that comparing his vertues &amp; his vices together, it was hard to iudge whether he were to bée counted amongst the good or the naughtie: * but I meant those, who though sprinckled with some imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, yet wrie rather to the good, then the euill.</p>

                  <p>I take the Intollerable and Ill, for those who for their apparent faultes are pointed at with the finger, and holden for infamous, whose companie wée ought altogether to eschew. For al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world cannot let, but that the world wil iudge those which haunt their co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie to be like vnto them.</p>

                  <p>The abuse of the world is such, that many horrible vices, are become familiar and common, insomuch that it is counted a fault not to haue them, and not to know howe to practise them. And therefore I am of opinion, that if wee must forgoe the company of the yll, wée shall haue but a few left to deale withall: insomuch that wee shoulde bee faine to change conuersation into solitarinesse, and to discende to particularities. You know how gréeuous the offences are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted against God, by the meanes of blasphemous othes, which at this day are growne to suche abuse, that there are few or none which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>firme not their saiyngs with these wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked &amp; detestable swearings, and which thinke not therby to bewtifie and set foorth their speach, as an Oration is with fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures. Neither am I able to report vnto you in what maner a young Gentleman a friende of mine was mocked in the Court, for that in his greatest chafe, hee alwaies swore by the body of a Hen. And at the end, to the end he might bée ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a good Courtier, he was driuen to leaue the Hen, and to betake himself to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Saints. That which I say of swering, I meane likewise of many other haynous faults, which at

this day are to be found in the most part of men. And for that they are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon, I feare me, it be to no purpose that you haue prescribed to auoid the company of the naughtie, séeing that (if I may say it) <hi>Of one selfe pitch, we all haue a touch</hi>: And that those which in shew séeme innocent lambes, are in deede rauening Wolues, &amp; worse then those who are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted most wicked.

                  <p>* We are in déede become more weake in ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and more strong in vice, then our predecessours were, * and I sée by you, you haue read the sentence of the Poet <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race,</hi> which saith:
<q>
                        <l>From Grandsiers scarce good, our fathers descended,</l>
                        <l>to commit euill, are readily intended:</l>
                        <l>In vs their sonnes more mischiefe doeth dwell.</l>
                        <l>but vs, our sonnes in vice will excell,</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And therfore I maruell not, if where as in old time there were few found to blaspheme the name of the great God, at this day there are many which will not sticke to teare him limme meale, insomuch that he is thought either a Sot, or one of a base minde which cannot sweare lustily. But if yée aske mée why these same are suffered in all companies, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they are farre worse and farre more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of punishment then the other of euill life, I wil say vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to passe, for that we make no reconing of the offences doone to Godwarde, as a thing which tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs not, and which perteineth to God alone to reuenge. But we cannot bee quiet when either wee our selues or our friends are iniured either in worde or déede, so that therein wée estéeme the creature aboue the Creator. For you shall sée him speake yll openly, &amp; with a lowd voice, of the name of God, who dareth not in a corner (as also it is not his part) so much as open his mouth to reprooue the Prince or the Magistrates.</p>

                  <p>Upon this point, there present themselues vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mée two contrarie reasons: For if I respect the common vse of the Countrie, which is nowe become auncient, and hath taken déepe roote, wee cannot but put them in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the desirable, and wee may boldly vse their company. On the other side, if I set my selfe to consider that this gamesome life is offensiue, and of euill example, and that in all other Countries the Gentlemen, and those which are well borne, woulde count it a shame to bée founde in publike places with cardes in their handes, some perchance woulde place them in the ranke of the intollerable. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:6169:32"/>
betwéene these twoo extréeme reasons, I sée one in the middest betwéene them, which maketh mée of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion that these men are to bée counted tollerable, for that though they haue by vse this abuse of playing, yet you shall finde that they apply it not to that ende, which o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>her game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters doe, to make a gaine of it, but for pastetime and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation sake: and besides wée knowe that for the rest of their life, they are so modest and vertuous as any other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are. And therefore I thinke, that that custome of playing béeing iudged of the worlde neither good nor euill, these men which vse it are not to bee reiected out of honest companie.</p>

                  <p>In my opinion this is a kinde of iniustice, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe that to these which is inhibited to others: and to giue them power to make of vice vertue. Your meaning is then, as farre as I gather, that as it is lawefull onely for the <hi>Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganes</hi> to robbe, so these also haue priuiledge to play in open stréete. But I woulde haue them thinke that the stréetes &amp; publike places ought to serue the common people for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise, and the Gentlemen for iustes, turnies, shewes, &amp; such like exercises, which appertaine more to good horseman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and warlike discipline, then cardes and dice doe. And therefore I am perswaded they haue nothing else to say, for defence of this their custome, but that which <hi>Diogenes</hi> said, who béeing asked why hee eate openly in the stréete, answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red because hée was a hungred in the stréete: so they play there, because being there, there commeth vpon them a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to play.</p>

                  <p>There is no helpe in it, but you must settle your selfe to like of such men with their imperfections, and to thinke that euery Nation, land, and Countrie, by the nature of the place, the climate of the heauen, and the influence of the starres hath certaine vertues, and certaine vices, which are proper, naturall, and perpetuall vnto it. And as good and sharpe wittes flourishe where the ayre is pure and subtill, so there are founde dull and grosse heads where the ayre is foggie and thicke. And touching conditions
<pb facs="tcp:6169:33"/>
you knowe that the <hi>Greekes</hi> though singular in learning and eloquence, yet are they disloyal and faythles, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is prouerbially saide, <hi>The Greekish fayth.</hi> Moreouer, there are other people who by naturall vertue are giuen to the industrie and discipline of warre, and by natural vice are driuen to haughtinesse and drunkennesse, some are able ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily to sustaine and stoutly to beare out paine, watching and trauaile, who on the other side are vainglorious &amp; braggers. To some, stout hardinesse, and deuout holinesse, haue béen al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes proper and natural, who neuerthelesse are world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and vnconstant. I am sure also you make no doubt of it, but that we <hi>Italians</hi> haue likewise some vices &amp; vertues natural, and that wée doe no lesse exceede in the one, then excell in the other. But if it seeme no maruaile vnto you to sée these diuers fashions and customes, according to the diuersitie * and great distance of Countries, doe but consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der howe much wee differ onely within the circuite of <hi>Italy,</hi> in the <hi>Romane, Tuscane, Lombardie,</hi> and other partes of it: then behold one of those partes apart, and cast your imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation on the centre or point of <hi>Montferrat,</hi> and you shall finde, howe onely the riuer <hi>Po</hi> and <hi>Tanar</hi> make Countries to differ in language, apparell, life, and manners, which are no further distant one from another, then from one side or banke of the riuer to the other. Wherevppon you will graunt me, that all Countries haue their naturall faults to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with their vertues: wherby you may bée assured, that if other people haue not vsed to play at cardes and dice o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly, yet perchaunce they haue brought in vre both pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely and priuately vices farre more pernicious then this. Now to lose no more time about this point, I say vnto you, that it is not inconuenient, but necessary, to folow the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of manners and customes, according to the diuersitie of the Countries, * and to imitate <hi>Alcibiades,</hi> to whom it was counted a praise, that hee had so readie a wit to frame him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to the diuersitie of the life and maners of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, * and according to the saying, <hi>When one is at Rome, to liue as they doe at Rome.</hi>

                  <p>The least punishement that they deserue is, to haue their tongues pulled out, as <hi>Iupiter</hi> serued a certaine nymph, who bewrayed his secret loues to <hi>Iuno</hi>: but I mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile nothing though many fal into this falt, for that we na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally run vpon things which are forbidden vs. Whervpon a certain wise man vsed to say, that it was more easie to hold a burning coale, then a secret word in ones mouth. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I hold him for a very foole, which discouereth his secrets to another, if necessitie force him not. For according to the saying, He bringeth him selfe in subiection to another, which telleth his secret to him who knewe it not. I remember me to this purpose, of a pleasant part of a seruing man, to whom his maister gaue certaine garments: which he no sooner had, but he gaue them forthwith to a friend of his, &amp; as his mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster blamed him for it, hee made answere, why woulde you haue mee kéepe them, when you your selfe coulde not kéepe them? A man may shape vs the like answere in reuealing our secretes, which we our selues could not kéepe hidden in our hearts. And we ought to hold it for a ground, that things committed to the eares, are for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most part proclaimed in the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:6169:36"/>
stréets. But as it is a great falt to disclose y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> secrets of other: so contrariwise, it is a notable vertue to know how to holde ones peace, and to bridle his tongue. And if we be bounde to keepe close the secrets of a friend: how much more ought we secretaries to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceale the secrets of our maister, who giueth vs wages to the end we should be secret? and that we should imitate the Gréeke, who as one told him his mouth stunke, answered, that the cause of it was the many secrets which he suffred to mould and vinew within it. Which may be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood not only of other mens secretes, but of our own also. And in very déede he that will keepe his thoughts secret, let him not vnfolde them to any other, but let him be his owne secretary. But me thinkes I am strayed out of our way, and therefore it were better we returned to the distinction of the yll tongued.</p>

                  <p>Naye rather, your briefe and sententious dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course came well to the purpose, and I willingly gaue eare to it, as matter not procéeding from a Secretary imployed in triffles. Let vs now speake of yll tongued forgers, whose naughtinesse is such, that they wil accuse you to haue done or saide that which you neuer thought. Wherein you often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times receiue iniury of two persons: to wit, of the false accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, who according to the prouerb, speketh reprochful words to one that is deafe, which is, to backbite the absent: &amp; of him who before he vnderstand the matter, giueth credit to those false surmises. This questionlesse is an ouer great fault, and in the number of these forgers I put those, who if you shall speake any thing vnto them soberly and sagely, make a false and peruerse interpretation of it, and wrest it to some euill meaning. The ill tongued byters follow next, out of whose mouth procéede certaine short nips, which pearce our harts more then sharpe arrowes: And though they quippe &amp; scoffe oftentimes according to the trueth, yet they are not cleare from gilt, for that they doe it with a spyteful mind: whereby they incur blame and ill will: Yea they are so indiscréet and insolent, that they had rather forgoe a faythfull friende, then a scoffing spéeche. Neither can they so couer
<pb facs="tcp:6169:37"/>
their wordes vnder the cloake of pleasauntnesse or grauitie, but that their maliciousnesse is discyphered. But as they are blame worthie, who with such tauntes stir vp mens choler, so those are to be borne withall, who being prouoked, return one scoffe with an other: and those answeres euer are worth two of those which are made vnprouoked. Wherof we haue a thousande examples: amongst others, this is knowne to most men, which was made to the Emperour <hi>Augustus,</hi> who méeting by chaunce with a straunger which resembled him verie much in fauour, asked him if his mother had at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time béene at <hi>Rome,</hi> insinuating thereby in flouting ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that he might be his fathers bastarde sonne. But the straunger answered him no lesse boldly then merily, my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was neuer there, but my father hath.</p>

                  <p>Such déedes are blameable; yea, and deserue punishment rather then blame. * Now you haue heard how many sortes there are of the yll tongued in the world, &amp; how grieuous their fault is: which is moreouer more shamefull when it is committed against the dead, for that the euil spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker sheweth thereby manifestly his base and abiect minde, in offending those who can not defende them selues, against whom while they were aliue, they durst not perchance once open their lippes.

Wherefore all these kinde of euil speakers gathered together, I say, that though they are had in hatred, yet commonly they are not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the company of others: for that they are not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked on the forhead, by reason wherof we cannot refuse their company, but must away with them so well as we may.</p>

                  <p>Your request is very reasonable, whereto I briefly answere, saying vnto you, That like as certaine beastes, hauing to incounter with Serpentes, haue first re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to certaine simples, which, being eaten, haue power to represse and mortifie their venome: so hauing often to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with the euil tongued, we ought to be armed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> some preseruatiue. And for my part, I finde no presenter remedie, when in our presence a foule mouthed railer fileth his toung to touch someone, then to abase our eyes, and not to séeme to
<pb facs="tcp:6169:38"/>
take pleasure in his railing spéech. For when he perceiueth we delight not in his words, he wil forbeare to speake euill. You know that arrowes will not sticke in stones, so neither wil their rotten roots stick fast, but where they find y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground soft &amp; apt to receiue them. And I say thus much vnto you fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that if wee will seeke diligently which is the greater fault, either to giue eare to an euill speaker, or to speake yl of others, we shall confesse in the end, (as others haue done) that we are not able to giue any determinate iudgement of it. And to say the trueth, whosoeuer giueth hearing to a slaunderous detractor, giueth him occasion to offende: and it is so greate chaunce, but that hee him selfe is one of the same stampe. So that he which speaketh, thinketh he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitteth no fault, or at least if he doe, that hée parteth it in the middle, giuing one halfe to the hearer, and taking the other vnto him selfe. Whereby it commeth to passe, that like two blinde men which leade one an other, they fall both into one ditch. Let vs then stoppe our eares, against the woordes of suche manner of people, and so dooing wee shall represse their vnbridled tongues, and get great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and credite with the wise. And as it is well done to beare no part in the yll report of others, so is it a déede de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruing commendation, to make no account of the slaunders which others rayse of vs. And wée ought to prepare our selues to haue our eares as readily at our commaunde, as they haue their tongues. By the example of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, who making warre against an other King, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring one of his souldiers speake yll of him, rebuked him sharpely, saying, I giue thée pay to fight against mine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, not to rayle against him. The same <hi>Alexander</hi> vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding that some misreported him, went not about a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way to reuenge it, but answered sagely, &amp; with a Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly modestie, that it belonged to a King to doe well, and heare yll. * Ad héereto, the saying of <hi>Augustus,</hi> who hearing that <hi>Tiberius</hi> was verie sory that hee bare him self so modestly &amp; patiently towardes those that spake yll of him, wrote vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him these woordes, Doe not (my <hi>Tiberius</hi>) héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

yet euerie one commendeth it in heart: and I promise you, that among so many cities, countries, and nations as I haue trauelled, I neuer yet found man so fierce and sauage which hath not suffered him selfe to be coyed and clawed with the tickling of flatterie: and by long experience, I haue noted that all persons of great valour, and of the best wits take a singuler pleasure no lesse to flatter others, then to be flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them selues. You are not ignorant that if you, minding to extol me, cam and tolde me that I were a strong wrast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, or an excellent musition, I should thinke you mockt mee because no part of those partes are in me, but when you shal commend me for writing a fayre hand, or a pure stile, or for any thing else concerning my profession, I shall for manner and modestie sake make some curtesie to accept your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, but in my minde I shalbe well apaide of it: as well for that I perswade my selfe, that all which you shall say of me touching those matters, is most true, as for that naturally I am desirous of praise and commendation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And I remember I haue read, that <hi>Themistocles</hi> beeing as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked what woordes vttered on the stage, pleased him best, answered, those which recount my prayses.

                  <p>Tush Maister <hi>Annib.</hi> Flatterie is the way to make friends, and winne preferment: and I am perswaded, that hée which knoweth not howe to glose and flatter, knoweth not howe to behaue himselfe in companie. I hearde once a French Lorde say to his friends, flatter mée, and ye doe me the greatest pleasure in the worlde. * And there is no man but knoweth, that as bitter reprehension is the beginning of enmitie, so gentle adulation is an entrie to amitie. * But if you thinke that flatterie doeth often make men do amisse, I am of the contrarie opinion: for as hee, which is worthilie commended, is thereby the more incouraged to goodnesse, so he that séeth himselfe praysed without desert, acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to himselfe his vnwoorthinesse, &amp; indeuoureth by his déedes to become worthie of such praise. And if flatterie were a fault, discréete fathers and schoolemaisters would not vse it towards yong children, who notwithstanding they do not speake, reade, write, sing or daunce, or any such like, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly and perfectly, yet their fathers or maisters cease not greatly to extol that which they doe, to the ende to incourage them to goe forward from good to better. You sée also, that nature hath planted a certaine kinde of fawning flatterie, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the hearts of litle infants, who runne and imbrace, &amp; kisse their parents and friends, when they woulde obtaine any thing at their hands: yea and hath taught it vnto beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who to haue our a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The worlde (to make it short,) is full of flatterie, and is maintayned by flatterie, and at this day it is more in fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then picked beardes, or great ruffes. You sée howe all persons, to the intent to auoide contention, and to bee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in companie, sooth one an other, not onely by spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, but by holding their peace, and séeming to consent to other mens sayings. In déedes likewise double diligence is often vsed, as, though wée sée the garmentes of our mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster or friend verie cleane without spot or mote, yet to picke vs a thanke, wée will not sticke to rubbe and wype them with the lappe of our cloake, as if there were dust or durt vppon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Againe, there are some who whyle others speake, though they giue no care at all vnto them, yet they nodde their heads, and abase their eyes, and with signes séeme to holde vpp their yeas and nayes, which is nothing else but méere flatterie. You know also that we natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hate cauillers and Sophists, who at euery woorde wil o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthwart vs, and as they say, séeke knottes in Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rushes: and howe on the other side those, which séeme to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to our sayings, eyther in wordes or iesture, wée repute them for our friendes, wee beare them great affection, and loue to bée in their company, taking their flatterie in stéede of curtesie and good will. In so muche that we count him eyther enuious or proude, whiche doeth not sooth vs in all thinges: and so greate is our vaineglorie, that when men commende vs, though wee thinke it farre
<pb facs="tcp:6169:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
aboue our desert, yet wée attribute it rather to the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of good will, then to the fraude of flatterie. You shall neuer heare any giue the lie to an other for prayses, which hée shall wrongly and falsely slaunder him withall, but béeing puffed vp with pride and vainglorie, with a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry looke, hée maketh answere, The good will, which you beare mée, causeth you to say so. Therefore not without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, a certaine Flatterer (being aduised to speake the truth) answered in déed, A man ought to speake the trueth to him that will heare it: but who is hée? But neuerthelesse take this with you, that as trueth getteth hatred, so flatterie win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth loue, and bréedeth good blood, in so much that hée, which should take flattery out of the worlde, shoulde take away al humanitie and curtesie, For then we should not salute him whom we take to be our enemy, wheras now we sée, that he biddeth vs good morrowe with his mouth, which wisheth vs much sorowe in his heart. But what will you haue a man doe? * We must by their example giue them mery lookes, and fleer in their faces: we must play the Foxe with Foxes, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude art, with art. * And as it is a fault stifly to stand in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ones friend, so is it a vertue to know how to giue place &amp; yeld in giuing him the vpper hand. Like as the wyly <hi>Anichin</hi> did in <hi>Boccace,</hi> who suffering a Gentlewoman to mate him at chests, therby made him selfe her mate at better sport. * By these reasons therefore I conclude, that to winne fauour, &amp; happily to atchiue our purposes, we must alwaies haue praysing and pleasing wordes in our mouth, * and wée must count it commendable to extol both by woords &amp; signes the dooinges of others, and to giue them tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And first I say vnto you, that men for the most part, are Flatterers of themselues, making themselues beléeue they are that, which they are not. * With which folly Princes are oft times
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:6169:41"/>
blinded, like as <hi>Domitian</hi> was, who was neither afeard nor ashamed to cause him selfe to be called Lorde and God. Of whom a flatterer writeth these wordes to his glorie, but to his owne shame, <hi>The Edict of our Lorde and God.</hi> Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise <hi>Alexander</hi> suffering this madnesse to enter into his head, thought it not enough to be a man and a King, and to haue the title of great: but he would on Gods name, be called the sonne of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> neither was he wel pleased with those which did not sooth him in it. Whereof his mother complained, saying, Hée woulde bring her into disgrace with <hi>Iuno,</hi> for making her a Cucqueane. But at this diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie a certaine Philosopher, who had no skill in flattering, made a scoffe, who séeing his Phisition in his sicknesse pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for the recouery of his health a certaine supping or broth, sayde, Our God hath put the hope of his health in a messe of broth: so that those whiche loue them selues, so without measure, * willingly giue eare to flatterers, of whom they thinke they are praysed, when in trueth they are but flattered. And therefore no meruayle though flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers are so acceptable. Yet notwithstanding, men of discretion, which knowe them selues and their desertes, though naturally they are desirous of prayse, yet they loue not to be flattered, or praysed without cause: for so much as false prayse is naught els but mockerie, and therefore I thinke you not so gréedie of glorie, that if in the recitall of your prayses I should intermedle any thing which were not true, you would can mée any great thanke for it, but would blame mée either in woordes openly, or in your heart secretly.</p>

                  <p>You are deceiued, and it is you your selfe that haue receiued the wounde: for hauing alreadie sayde, that if a flatterer prayse you, you will not take him for a flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer
<pb facs="tcp:6169:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
towardes you, and nowe not allowing me to attribute vnto you a vertue, which you déeme your selfe to haue, you are contrary to your selfe, and make me appeare a true dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and no flatterer. Besides that, when I say, I take you to be such a one that séeketh not prayse without desert, this is no commendation, but rather a good opinion that I haue of you: This were a commendation, if I did affirme ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely that you were suche a one as woulde giue no eare to flatterers. Wherefore my woordes hauing no signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of prayse, they can not receiue any interpretation or suspition of flatterie. Nowe following our purpose, I say againe, That a wise man doeth neuer agrée to the false prayses of flatterers, who resemble altogether the Fishe <hi>Polypus</hi>: for as that Fishe chaungeth colour accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the obiect that it incountreth, so they alter their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions according to the appetie of the hearers: and they are termed by an auncient Authour enemylike friendes, for vnder their pleasaunt sugred woordes, they kéepe hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den a bitter venomous meaning, * in like manner as the hooke is hidden vnder the bayte, or the Serpent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest the flowers: Neither are they vnlike the But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher who claweth the Hogge with his hande, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to come conueniently to laye his Béetle vppon his pate. Neither is it to bée saide, that flatterie woorketh any good, for that a man commended without cause, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth to deserue it: for a cunning flatterer, setteth the garmentes so artificially vppon the backe of him whom hée disguiseth withall, that the seames shall not bée séene: and betaketh him selfe in suche sorte to thinges like to bée true, that hée maketh them taken for true in déede. And albeit some famous writers haue intreated of the meanes to discerne a friend from a flatterer, yet is it in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion verie harde (that I may not say impossible) to attaine to that knowledge, as well for that the worlde is full of these tame beastes, as also for that it is harde to discerne the euill which resembleth the good. And therefore it was well sayde of a wise man, That as the Woolfe is like to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:6169:42"/>
the Dogge, so is the flatterer to the friend: and that wée must take héede to mistake, least thinking to set our selues in the kéeping of Dogges, wée fall into the deuouring of Wolues. But be it so, that you féele the smell of false praise, yet notwithstanding you shall not féele in your selfe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse and desire of deserte, which you speake of: for this false prayse hath a showe of trueth, and is bestowed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you as due and deserued. I come nowe to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of parentes, who as you say, flatter their children, to incourage them to vertue, and of children, who on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side flatter their parentes, to wring some thing from them: and I say vnto you, That these twoo cases differ. The first is not in trueth flatterie, for that there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit in it.</p>

                  <p>That if I be not deceiued, requireth more déepe consideration: and we must first vnderstande, that some to get fauour, vse to vphold and extoll whatsoeuer others shall say, without gainsaying any thing: some on the contrary, fall to contention continually, and crosse other mens say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges, and these two extréemes are naught, betwéene which thereto lieth a way, which those kéepe, who * will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther altogether sooth, neither altogether thwart, but * in an honest sort knowe howe to allowe, or disallowe the sayinges of others in time and place, as it becommeth an honest man to doe. Next, wée must note, that those who holde vp eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ones yeas and nayes, only to the intent to delight, ought to be called iesters, but when they doe it for their aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, they are without question flatterers. And according
<pb facs="tcp:6169:43"/>
to this distinction, children, which imbrace their parentes to get something from them, are to be termed flatterers: but in this case, wée haue further to consider, that children can not giue prayse, or shewe loue to their parentes, that may surmount their naturall and bounden duetie, or that may be more then their parentes thinke they haue merited.</p>

                  <p>They doe not only perceiue it, but also con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue well of it, and doe not count it craft as you doe, but rather a thing commendable, for that they sée their children therein to followe nature as their Mistresse, which tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth vs to humble our selues in our néede, and to craue of others by déedes sounding foorth their prayse, and setting foorth our affection towardes them, and to know that hée which wil haue, must aske, and he which wil enter into the house, must first knocke at the gate. And albeit we ought at all times to giue prayses to our heauenly father, yet wée are most stirred theretoo, both with tongue and hearte, when wée are desirous to obtaine any thing at his handes. And to appease his wrath, wée call him not iust, but make mention of his clemency and mercy, whereof wée stande in néede. Whereof, according to this consideration, we may rightly conclude, that suche manner of déedes ought not to runne vnder the name of flatterie, and that infantes, no nor children of discretion, can not (though they would) vse flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie towardes their parentes. Which <hi>Pittacus</hi> one of the seuen wise men of <hi>Greece</hi> plainely shewed, saying, <hi>Neuer be afeard to bee counted a flatterer of thy father.</hi> And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the example of the poore which begge almes with glauering woordes. I answere, that necessitie hath no lawe: and if to auoyde hunger, in some countries theft bee suffered, muche more ought flatterie to bee borne withall. And besides, I thinke that it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:6169:43"/>
to bée called flatterie: for that a Flatterer doeth not vse openlye to shewe his néede, but cunningly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boureth to mooue men to extende their liberalitie towardes him. And by the selfe same reason, I mainteine the cause of the Oratour, who craueth openly of the Prince or Iudge, that which hee desireth to obteine: neither ought hee any more to bée blamed, then hée which saith, take heede to thy selfe, for I meane to strike thée. For as this same ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifesteth his intent, and giueth his aduersary leasure to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare to defende himselfe: so the Oratour entreth not into the fielde, but that the iudge first knoweth the request hee is to make, and bethinketh him of the meanes which shall bee v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to sounde his opinion. There remaineth nowe no more but the last example of louers, who I am content to confesse vnto you, are in déede no better then flatterers. For a greater man then my selfe confesseth as much, writing, that if their beloued bée flat nosed, they tearme her amiable: if hauked, they call her Princely: if shée bée browne, they count her manly: if white, heauenly. But this is not to bée maruelled at, séeing louers are both lawlesse, and witlesse, and that in their heartes as our Poet saith:
<q>
                        <l>The senses beare the sway, and reason is subdued.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as the louer flattereth his Mistresse, so she flattereth her selfe, for that there is no woman so deformed, who hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring herself called bewtiful, beléeueth it not, or at least thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth not to bée estéemed for such of her louer. And as the Crowe to giue credite and consent to the prayses which the Foxe gaue him, let the pray fall foorth of his mouth: so many vnfortunate women haue felt the euill which commeth of flatterie, for that by the breath of prayses, as a Feather in the wind, they haue suffered themselues to be lifted so high, that being not able there to sustaine them selues, they haue falne to the grounde, and in the fall haue giuen their honor such a foyle, that of Mistresses, they haue become seruantes. Nowe touching that point of ciuilitie and curtesie, where you say wee salute those who are our enimies, I say that this sentence is most true; that we must not take for Doues
<pb facs="tcp:6169:44"/>
all that say <hi>Peace bee vnto you,</hi> but those ought to bée ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med dissemblers, rather then flatterers.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
                  <p>There is as muche difference betwéene those two, as betwéene the generall and the speciall. For it is true that hée which flattereth, faigneth: but not on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. And to explane it vnto you, beholde a fencer, who ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at his enimies head, striketh him on the legge, or some where els: you may well say that this fellowe dissembleth, but not that hée flattereth. And valiant Captaines also, doe they not deceiue the enimie, when they make a shewe to goe one way, and then take another? and are not victories wonne as wel by Stratagemes and policies of warre, as by force of armes? which kinde of counterfeiting is not bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meable, but rather commendable. And not only amongst enimies, but amongest friendes and acquaintance, coloura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dealing is tollerable, in thinges which are not preiudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all vnto them. As if I bée requested to goe sée some Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, or some Play, or some such like thing, &amp; that I haue no minde to goe thither, I will make as though I were yll at ease: or if I would not bée knowne by night, I will disguyse my selfe in some sort. You sée then, that dissembling stret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to many things, and to diuers endes, and that flattery is more strict, and conteined vnder dissimulacion, as the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall vnder his generall. Wherefore I conclude, that as it is not lawefull to dissemble in flattering, for that it is not hurtfull to him towardes whom it is vsed, so is it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted (neither can it bée saide to bée a faulte) to dissemble without harme, &amp; without intent to hurt another. I graunt well, that hee which maketh a shewe to loue one, to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to deceiue him, or do him wrong, is much too blame, and that the Philosopher counteth him worse then a forger of monie, for that there can bée no friendship, where there is counterfeiting. But if for ciuilitie and good manner sake, I salute one whom I am acquainted withall, without
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:6169:44"/>
shewing any affection towardes him, I ought not therefore to be called a dissembler<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for that I am mooued to do him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, rather in way of curtesie, then of good wil. Besides, you knowe that the worlde is full of naughtie men, whom wée iustly hate for their imperfections: but it is not good to giue them to vnderstande what yll will wée beare them. And bethinke your selfe héerein, that many are beloued which are not honoured, as children, who are loued, not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured of their parents: and contrariwise many are hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which are not loued, as some Princes, not well liked of their subiects, or some Magistrates, which are honoured, but not loued of the people: And therefore wée cannot often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; nor ought not to faile in ciuilitie and curtesie, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect only of our owne duetie. For wée are bound to * re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salute those which salute vs, bée they our inferiours or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals: If they be princes or magistrates, or our superiours, wée ought to doe them honour for the reuerence due to their estate, if not for affection. I thinke I haue sufficiently she<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the difference betwéene faining, and flattering. Now I say againe, returning to flatterers, that they are men of most vile and naughtie nature. And though it bée a harde mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as wée haue saide already, to discerne a friende from a flatterer, yet wée must note, that commonly the greater are flattered by the lesser, and the more they are in prosperitie, the more they are beset with flattterers: who alwaies make their repaire thither where profite is to bée reaped. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it commeth that Princes are euer besieged by these euill spirites: wherevpon <hi>Carneades</hi> vsed to say, that Princes sonnes neuer learne to doe any thing well, but only to ryde, for that their gouernours and teachers séeke to please them, and make them beléeue they are sufficiently séene in thinges whereof they haue no skill at all, which happeneth not in ryding their horses, for the horse, which is no flatterer, and which maketh no more accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the great then of the smal. throweth them to the ground, if they cannot sitte fast in the sadle. And therfore we must beware of such persons, both for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are hurtful to vs, &amp; because god is displeased with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.
<pb facs="tcp:6169:45"/>
And I am in doubt whether bée the greater offence of him that slaunderously reproueth the good, or of him that flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly commendeth the euill. I remember I haue lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned long since, that God is gréeuously offended to heare one either like to himself discommended, or vnlike, commended: &amp; no doubt, but it is a great fault, through flatterie to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende for one thing, for which hée ought of right to bée re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proued: which is signified vnto vs by the sentence. <hi>Woe bee vnto you which call the euill good</hi>: These flatterers are resembled to those which put a pillow vnder our heads, and delicate &amp; soft Feathers vnder our bodies to make vs sléepe. Likewise those are in great fault which flatter of purpose to hurt, like as <hi>Iudas</hi> did. And therefore it is written, That it is better to bée beaten of ones friende, then kissed of his eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimie, to wit, a flatterer: and for the conclusion, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende that in one which is euill, is the déede of a deceiuer, and a very kinde of treason. * And therefore the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Sigismund</hi> is worthie commendation, who hearing a certaine shamelesse fellowe call him God, vp with his fist, and gaue him a boxe on the eare, and when hée saide, why doest thou strike mée Emperour?

                  <p>Albeit I cannot abide the qualities and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of such manner of men, yet I remember I haue hearde a vertuous and noble Gentleman to make good account of them, saying, That those are indued with excellent wittes, which can maintayne their priuate opinions against the common opinion of all: and that wée hearken vnto them with more attention and admiration. And in good sooth, if you shoulde with a long discourse prooue vnto mée that the Sunne is cléere and hot, you woulde make mée haue no
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:6169:46"/>
great lyst to listen vnto you, for that you shoulde tell mée no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but that which I knowe before: but if you will make good that it is obscure and colde, O howe you woulde stirre vp my spirites, and make mée attentiue to heare you. It was therefore, that a certaine Philosopher hearing that there was one preparing himselfe to make a speache, in the praise of <hi>Hercules,</hi> answered, Why? who discommendeth him? Beholde on the contrarie, with howe great pleasure and admiration wée reade the <hi>Paradoxes</hi> of diuers wittie and learned writers, specially the pleasant pamphlets made in praise of the plague, and of the French poxe. And if you replie, that this belongeth rather to a fantasticall Poet, then to a graue authour, I woulde haue you consider, in what estimation the Philosopher <hi>Fauorine</hi> is, onely for the fame hee hath woone, for extolling, with many and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guler praises, the quarterne Ague: which notwithstanding the Frenchmen wishe to their enimies, as the greatest euill which may befall them. And therfore I am of opinion, that in things of most difficultie, consisteth most excellencie and admiration. And I sée you Philosophers dispute and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue one against another, and holde singuler opinions farre from the trueth: so that the Gentleman of whom I spake euen now, would place these men rather amongst the desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, then the tollerable.</p>

                  <p>I thinke good that whom you haue nowe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, should bée put in the rowe of the desirable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, which deserue not the name of contentious: for though they swarue from the trueth, yet they haue some shew of reason in their talke, and besides, they do not thinke what they say, doing it to no other ende, but to shewe their sharpe and good wit, not that they haue conceiued any such opinion in themselues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that it were great folly to thinke that <hi>Fauorine</hi> was desirous to haue the quarterne Ague, and those other writers the Plague. But those whom I call contentious and ouerthwarters, are for the most parte grosse headed fellowes: and it is an olde saying,
<pb facs="tcp:6169:47"/>
that the vice of contradiction is proper to men of small dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion: who oppugne the trueth, either of ignorance, or of obstinacie: and they are like to Heretikes, who being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uicted by inuincible reasons, yet will yéelde nothing at all, but reply still to the contrarie. Moreouer, these contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous companions loue to bée doeing with euerie one, and yet still goe by the worse: and when they are able to mainteine Argument no longer by any reason, they enter into a chafe, and séeke to get the vpper hande by outcries, swearing, threatning, and arrogant demeanour. And some time it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth that they méete with men of like nature, whereby euen for very trifles they fall to dyre debate and strife. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that you alledge afterwardes of Philosophers, I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers you, that it is not only laweful and méete for them to dispute, but also for all other men, when they enter into rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning amongest themselues, and are of contrary opinions: and he deserueth greatest praise, which defendeth the hardest part, and though they disagrée in wordes, yet they disagrée not in loue and mutuall goodwill, but séeke with one accord the trueth: not vnlyke to those which make Cordes, who though they winde and twist one contrarie to the other, yet they thereby accomplishe the worke they take in hande. But yet disputations haue their boundes and limites prescribed, which it is not lawful to passe without loosing the name of a Disputer, &amp; getting the title of contentious caueling Sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, who many times thereby come to mischiefe, and by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too earnest in contrarying, haue béen distraught of their right vnderstanding. And as things, by making them too thinne and fine, are soone broken, so by too much contention, the trueth is made intricate and doubtfull. And therefore those are to bée called contencious, who not of purpose to dispute or exercise their wit, but of a contemptuous arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie, hold argumentes not only repugnant to the trueth, but altogether dissonant from reason.</p>

                  <p>There commeth to my mind, touching these kindes of lyes, a pleasant example, happened in the Court, where I knewe a Princes sonne, being about twelue yéeres old, who in behauiour and good conditions surpassed al other his equals in the Court, but hée had one childishe fault, which neither by admonishing, neither by reprehending, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by threatning, hée coulde bée made to leaue. Which was this, Hée woulde through negligence suffer his nose alwaies to be sneueled, &amp; tooke no care to wype it: while his gouerner tooke paines to amend this fault, there co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth on a time to this child, to craue his deuotio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a poore old man, whose nose by some infirmitie was become meruellous great, deformed, ful of pimples, precious, &amp; monstrous: the childe with a certain feare mixed with compassion, was much mooued at it, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon his discrete gouernour began to say vnto him, that hée had knowne that poore man a long time, and remembred hée had séene him in his youth with a little nose, well fashioned and sound, but that afterwarde the sneuil and filth for want of wyping and making it cleane had brought it into that case. The childe was put into such a feare by these words, that hee began foorthwith to spit, and to blowe and wype his nose in such sort, that hée neuer after néeded to bee put in minde of it. And therefore this lye was profitable to the Prince, and commendable for the gouernour.</p>

                  <p>So long as a man passeth not those bounds, he ought not to bée tearmed ambitious, but couragious, for so much as these same are works commendable, and vertues:
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:6169:50"/>
but that can not be saide of those which procéede naturally of ambition, which altogether bereaueth them of rest, which set no staye to their restlesse desires: which filleth them full of pensiue care, blindeth their vnderstanding, rayseth them aloft, to the intent to throw them downe headlong, to breake their neckes, and bring them to destruction. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon it is saide, that Lucifer through pride and ambition fell from heauen, desiring rather to commaunde, then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey. And it is saide by an other, That ambition is the crosse and torment of the ambitious. And therefore when I saide that ambition is the cause of many abuses, I ment not those men, which knowing their owne valour, aspire to high enterprises and honours, which by the instinct of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we all couet: for that honour is the rewarde of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and counted a diuine thing. But my meaning is of the ambitious, who without taking any paine, without doing any thing méete for a noble minde, and without any foundation of deserte, séeke in companie to goe before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to be placed aboue others.</p>

But it is great glorie, and a signe of great desert, when that honour is done to one without striuing for it, and it is most certaine, that he which setting aside all ambition, humbleth him selfe beneath others, is of best estimation, and of best education. But women fall chiefely into this vanitie, and héerevpon there often ariseth amongest them the best sport in the worlds, for none of them béeing willing to giue place, and euerie one of them being ready to take place, they

And in my fansie, such people may bée resembled to tyrantes, which care not though they be hated, so that they may be feared. And therefore this sort of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons neuer loue to humble them selues, fearing that if they shoulde shewe them selues good fellowes, and become mates for euerie man, they should growe into contempt, so that their reputation thereby might be diminished.

vnto you, that according as I haue handled the matter, it is rather restrained then otherwise.

And whosoeuer shall obserue that order, well he may accompany with many by chaunce, but with fewe by choyce. And your selfe, though by reason of your affaires or other accident, you shall haue to deale with diuers persons, yet you will like much better, &amp; desire more willingly, the companie of one or two, to whom you shall be affectioned for the good partes you knowe to bee in them.

                  <p>It is euen so, like as also it is true, that we na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally abhor thinges, which differ from our nature. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it commeth, that one which is merily disposed, can not, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way with one which is heauyly giuen. One that is dul hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, cannot abide one that is sharp witted: and contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, the mery like of the mery, and the sad of the sad. And therefore we haue to consider, that nature hath put vpon vs twoo persons, wherof the one is common to all men, in so much as they are partakers of reason, and more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent then beastes: the other is proper to euery one, touching the difference which is seene in the countenance and iesture of the body and in the diuersitie of the mindes, wherof euery one tendeth and inclineth not onely to some good, but also to some euill. And by y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> meanes you sée y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one offendeth by arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancie, another by obstinacie, another by misreporting, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by flatering, another by couetousnes, another by vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gloriousnes, &amp; you must think that there is not any, in whom there is not some fault or imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either greater or lesser then that w<hi rend="sup">c</hi> is in our selues. But forsomuch as at this day we can not finde either friendes or parentes, which are in all pointes agreeable to our disposition and nature, wee must frame our selues to beare with the imperfections of others and according to the saying, we must loue a freend with his imperfection. And for that perfect and vertuous men are rare in the world, with whom we might liue to our heartes desire, wee ought not to reiect the companie of any,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:6169:53"/>
so that hée haue in him any shewe of vertue and goodnesse. * But to be acceptable in companie, we must put of as it were our own fashions and manners, and cloath our selues with the conditions of others, and imitate them so farre as reason will permit. And in some, touching the respect of honestie and vertue, wée ought to bée alwayes one and the same. But touching the diuersitie of the persons with whom wée shall be conuersaunt, wée must alter our selues into an other: according to that olde saying, <hi>The heart altogether vnlike, and the face altogether like to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> And he, which shall not frame him selfe to doe this, * shall bee driuen to curse Conuersation, and to pray vnto God with the snayle (as it is in the Fable) that to auoyde yll neighbours and naughtie companie, hée will giue him the grace to bée able to carrie his house about with him. Neither ought any to persuade him selfe that hée is without fault, for I am sure if I should refuse the companie of a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilling contentious fellowe, hée woulde perhappes refuse mine for some greater imperfection. And therefore I an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of opinion, that without looking too precisely vpon one fault, wée ought to admit the companie of all those, who in the rest of their woorkes and actions walke vprightly. And it is lawfull likewise, sometime to make as though wée sée not their faultes, and that wée haue a good opinion of them.</p>
                  <p>Touching this point, I remember the doinges of the Duke of <hi>Neuers,</hi> who making a feast in this Citie, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the charge of inuyting the Gentlewomen, to a young man, that was reputed to be very vicious and naught: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at the Citizens meruailed not a litle, forsomuche as his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie was aduertised long before of the qualities of this fellowe: and héerevpon some of the Ladies being in fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar talke, fell to a kinde of playe, by the priuiledge where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, one of them was inioyned to demaund of the Duke, why, being so many young Gentlemen in the Citie of great wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and good behauiour, hée caused the Gentlewomen
<pb facs="tcp:6169:54"/>
to bée bidden to the feast, by a dishonest and ill disposed per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: to whom hée answered, that hée was sure the good and hée shoulde alwayes well agrée together, and therefore hee thought it néedefull by some meanes to winne the good will of the ill.</p>

                  <p>I vnderstande you, hée meant to imitate him which light his candell before the ymage of the Diuell. Yet in my opinion to fauour the ill, is to offende the good: and I meruaile howe a Prince of so discréete iudgement, coulde make so vndiscréete a choice. But I thinke hee did it, as hee, who hauing not long tyme to soiourne there, sought by all meanes, to make euery one thinke well of him, after his departure: and like vnto the Sunne, hee woulde spread the beames of his bountie vppon all sortes of persons. But you may assure your selfe, hée woulde not haue made such a choice in his owne Countrie, where hee is not to learne to put a difference betwéene the qualities of his subiectes, to lift vpp the good, and throwe downe the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill.</p>

                  <p>I thinke verily that it is requisite so to do, but I doe not thinke hée had any such meaning as you speake of. For wise men of good iudgement, his likes take no care to bée beloued of the ill, but knowe that when they are well accounted of by the ill, they are ill thought of by the good.</p>

Take héede onely to content the good, and neuer take care what the euill say or thinke of you: For their iniuries can not hurt vertue and innocencie.

                  <p>I thinke that seruauntes, béeing naturally blabbes and full of tongue, wée doe it rather in hope that they will set foorth our curtesie, then for feare that they shoulde finde faulte with our couetousnes: and, besides, our good will and curtesie can not bée fully shewed of vs, nor gratefully accepted of the head, if it extende not to the members. You knowe also, that there are certaine maisters of that nature, that they loue in a manner bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ease and good vsage of their seruauntes, then of them selues: And therefore all the good cheare bestowed on them, is in respect of their maisters.

a brauery: like as those who at faires and markets vse great liberalitie, in bestowing fayrings on Gentlewomen, and then pinch for it, when they come home in their owne hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and perchaunce kéepe from the poore seruants their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>

                  <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
                  <p>That liberalitie is like the match of a Candle, which must néedes faile foorthwith, and therefore their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowme lasteth no longer then the faire. And they may well be compared to certaine litle beasts called <hi>Ephemeres,</hi> which are bred néere the riuer of <hi>Hyppan</hi> in <hi>Scithia,</hi> whose life la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth onely one day. And me thinkes those men make profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to loose their credite at home, to get it abroade: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, when the stinking breath commeth from the sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>make, it booteth not much to put some swéete thing in the mouth, to leaue there a pleasant smell: for at length the ill sauour surmounteth, &amp; it is not possible but the taste of the vessel must bée felt. Therefore these may thinke themselues wel ynough dealt withal, to bee put in the rowe of the other tollerable. But Gentleman, I haue suffred my selfe to bée so farre carried away with the pleasantnesse of your spéeche, that I neuer thought howe some of that time is slipt away, which I ought to haue bestowed in visiting my patients.

For me thinkes I see * the hand of so great a Philosopher as you are, * to cast a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den net into the large sea of morall Philosophie, to inclose therein, in short time, all the diuine precepts which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to our life.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>Nay looke not I pray you for that, for therin you shal but do as the countrie fellow did, who attended in vaine that the riuer should finish his course, that hee might haue gone ouer it. I neither can, neither ought in these discourses to followe the steps of the auncient Philosophers, for albeit their reasons be at this day the same, that they were a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yéere since, yet neither the times, the men, nor the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are like. I denye not but that there haue béen amongst vs, vniustly brought in, many corrupt customes, repugnant
<pb facs="tcp:6169:56"/>
to the lawes of Philosophie, but they haue by this tyme ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken so déepe footing and roote, that it is impossible to roote them out. For that the worlde is come to this passe, that it counteth any thing to bée lawefull, which is delightful. Wherefore if I shoulde indeuour, by precepts and reasons, to reforme the abuse of the worlde, and to reduce it to the vertuous and auncient custome, I shoulde not onely loose my labour, but bée laughed at for my labour. Nowe as there are some thinges, which by reason of the abuse they are growen to, are not to bée followed, though they were at first taught vs by good and wise maisters: so there are many thinges whiche of themselues beeing tollerable, yet either by the necessitie of the tyme, or by the since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of our Religion, they are not to bee allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As for example, wee doe not any more forbidde children wyne, before they arriue to the age of eightéene yeeres: and the necessitie of the tyme will not let vs to let men from marrying vntill they bée sixe and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie yéeres olde, and maydes vntill they bee eighteene: and to fulfill Gods commaundementes, after that man and woman are once ioyned together by the bonde of marriage, they can not any way bée loosed, or séeke di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uorce vppon euery light occasion, as in olde tyme they did, by the consent of the Philosophers: who if they were liuing at this day, woulde in many things refourme their wrytings, and conforme them to the customes of the present time. And for these reasons wée must treade out of the auncient path, and take the way which is beaten at this day. Wherefore you must not meruayle, nor lay it to mée as a deadly sinne, if in the discourse of ciuile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, I intreate rather of matters, which in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion are necessarie for the present tyme, then of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters written in Bookes, and vsed in tyme past, and if I speake rather lyke a méere Citizen, then a Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, without taking any care to get by my discourses those prayses and tytles which you haue giuen me, which
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:6169:56"/>
I neyther will nor ought to accept, beeing altogether vnfit for me.</p>

               <speaker>Guazzo.</speaker>
               <p>The humilitie which you shewe in this respect doeth exault you higher: yet I dare say this much, that you doe your selfe wrong, to debase in suche sorte, the greate learning wherewith you are indued, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring you this, that if I were so little inferiour to you in learning, as I knowe my selfe to bée a greate deale, I shoulde exault my selfe muche more then you doe.</p>

               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>If you were so much inferiour to mée, as I knowe you to bée greater, you shoulde commit a greater fault then I, to attribute so much to your selfe.

               <p>But in my minde, making your selfe meaner then you are, you offend in a certaine abiectnesse of minde, or in a kinde of dissembling, rather courtlike, then Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher like.

               <p>Truely I cannot but blame them: for to disprayse ones selfe too much, sheweth either some secret ambition, or some manifest basenesse of minde. And I count no lesse woorthie reprehension, those, who on the contrarie, exalting themselues too much, touch (as they say) the firmament with their finger. But I am sure, that in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king at this present of my selfe, I haue measured my forces, neither haue I swarued one iote from the trueth.</p>

               <p>To finde then the skill of <hi>Dedalus,</hi> and to kéepe the mid way, you must search out the cause of the faulty ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tréemes, and that being once knowen, you shall soone haue the remedie you require. Those faults then growe for the most part of solitarinesse, and for want of experience in the affaires of the world. Which causeth, that into a base mind, there entreth the distrust of his owne doings, and the feare of other mens iudgement. Contrariwise, that in a noble minde there groweth an ouer greate presumption, which transporteth him with an ouerwéening of himselfe, and a course account of others. And therefore if these manner of men frequented the companie of those who are wise and learned, there is no doubt but that the doings of other men woulde serue, to the one of them for a spurre, and to the other for a bridle.</p>

               <p>There are some doubtles woorthy great blame and mockery, who suffer those good parts, which bee in them to bée drowned in their cold and timorous hearts, in like sort as stones are in the water. And I coulde name certaine elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent personages, who hauing to speake in the presence of many, become quite dumbe. Some others I haue knowen in like case ready to fall into a sowne. Whereby I iudge them meruaylous vnfortunate, that cannot helpe themselues with those qualities they are indued withall, at such tyme as they stande in most néed of them, and better it were in a manner to be altogether without them.</p>

               <p>It cannot be denied, but that those men are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, but let vs nowe consider the arrogancie of those, who being full of presumption, and blinded with the loue of themselues, sée not their owne imperfections, and neuer care to knowe what opinion the worlde hath of them: Which is a signe not onely of presumpteous arrogancy, but also of sencelesse brutishnesse, whereof insue many incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniences, for so much as according to the saying of a

                  <l>Great euill is caused by that ignorance,</l>

               <p>Therefore it is sayde, that it is the easiest thing of all other, for one to deceiue himselfe: and I remember I haue read in the life of <hi>Esope,</hi> that a great personage pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing thorowe a stréete where were thrée slaues to bée solde, the one a <hi>Gramarian,</hi> the other a <hi>Musitian,</hi> and the thirde <hi>Esope</hi>: first hée asked the <hi>Gramarian</hi> what hée coulde doe, who answered, all things: then hée asked the <hi>Musitian</hi> the like question, who answered as the other did: but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to <hi>Esope,</hi> hée asked him what hée coulde doe, who an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, nothing at all. Howe happeneth that, sayeth the Gentleman? marie sayth <hi>Esope,</hi> these twoo héere being able to doe all things, haue left nothing for mée to doe. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wée may see, that those who will not presume to bée a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to doe any thing, knowe howe to doe most things, and those who take vppon them to knowe all things, are those which commonly knowe nothing at all. For so muche then as wée knowe, that for want of knowing and beeing experienced by meanes of conuersation, in the natures, manners, and dooings of others, wée offende eyther by arrogancie, or by distrust, you may consequentlie per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that the remedie which you séeke to flye those ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tréemes, and to followe the meane, is ciuile conuersation, and that chiefly which is practised out of the house, haunting many and diuers persons, whereof wée haue to speake this day.</p>

               <p>I woulde haue thought by those matters wee spoke of but nowe, that you had béen farre of, from those wée are to intreate to day, but I sée you haue brought mée thyther before I thought of it: whereat I meruayle
<pb facs="tcp:6169:58"/>
the more, and I am gladder of it. But before you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne this discourse, I woulde knowe whether your mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning bée, to propose one fourme and manner of conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whiche all indifferently shoulde vse, or at the least to assigne diuers sortes, according to the diuersitie of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>

               <p>As farre as I remember, I tolde you yester<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and nowe I tell you againe, that I meane to prescribe particularly to euery one: For if in conuersation all of vs shoulde behaue our selues in one sorte towardes all, wée shoulde soone come to the chiefe point of our purpose. It is very true, there are some generall thinges which euery one ought to obserue towardes euery one indifferently, whereof also wée will vse some spéech, but my desire is chiefly, that wee come to consider the diuers meanes which wee ought to vse, in vsing companie, according to the diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of persons. Whereby wée shall knowe, that it is not so easie to finde one manner of entertainement common to all men, as it is to finde a fashion for a Sadle to fit any Horse. And thereby wée shal perceiue, that as a man of good iudgement, such as your selfe, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not in one selfe manner and wordes to his betters, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals, and inferiours, so wée in our conuersation ought to procéed with the same iudgement, to put difference betwene causes and parties which are not equall.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Guaz.</speaker>
               <p>If then ciuile conuersation ought to varie accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the varietie of the persons, I doubt mee least the rules, which you shall set downe, wilbe long and hard: for that we are driuen by diuerse accidentes to haue to deale with diuerse persons, differing in sexe, in age, in degrée, in conditions, in country, and in nation.</p>

               <p>You sée in organes diuerse pipes, whereof eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one giueth a diuerse sowne, yet they are all proportioned together, and make one onely bodie: in like sort, albeit there be diuerse kindes of entertainemente and conuersation, yet in the end we shall perceiue that they agree together in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6169:58"/>
such sort, that they séeme in a manner one onely sort, and perchaunce more easie then we thinke for. Wherefore to make the matter more easie, we will deuide conuersation into publike, which is abrode with strangers: and priuate, which is at home in the house. And for that both is more then we can dispatch to day, I thinke it shall suffice for this time to discourse onely of publike conuersation, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we will reserue for to morrowe.</p>

               <speaker>Guaz.</speaker>
               <p>I looked that you would first haue spoken of this latter, for that by order of nature we begin conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the house with those that bée of houshold with vs, and after, wée learne to conuerse abroade with others.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>When in our yesterdayes discourse I proposed vnto you conuersation, aswel for the health of the minde, as the body, I meant of publike conuersatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, out of which espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the fruites and perfection wée haue spoken of are ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, and therfore to day wée will speake of that, which concerneth our principall purpose. Returning then to my discourse, I make good, that by meanes of ciuil conuersation, a man may not onely cléere himselfe of cowardly abiection, and vaine presumption, but besides, cloath himselfe with the knowledge of himselfe. For if you consider it wel, the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which wée haue to knowe our selues, is not ours, but wée borrow it of others: for so much as when wee are by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers persons aduertised, blamed, reproued, or by signes made more aduised for some fault, which wée commit either in word or déed, at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> length we are conte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to submit our selues to the common opinion of al men, &amp; come to acknowledge in our selues some imperfection, which wee indeuour to correct after other mens iudgement. And though it bee harde to finde one that will tell vs flatly the truethe, yet there is not any (at the least béeing a priuate person) so blinded in him selfe, but if hée bée faulty any way, by frequenting the companie of others, hée shall either haue occasion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred him to examine his owne conscience, and so of
<pb facs="tcp:6169:59"/>
him selfe to finde his owne fault, or else at one tyme or another, there shalbee one or other, whiche if not in way of good will, yet in manner of mockerie, or of scorne, or of spyte, or by one way or another, will make him to vnderstande his fault. And as these same as it were against their wills are driuen to amende their manners and life, so you see many of good iudgement, and lesse ouerséene in themselues, who, without tarying vntill they bee reprooued of others, are mooued of their owne proper will, to waygh diligently the sayings, the dooings, and the behauiour of others. And as they learne to eschue those thinges which they sée to bée vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>séemely in any, so they indeuour to followe and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to themselues those things whiche are commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in others, so that by Conuersation they become markers and imitatours of wise men, and such as are patternes to bée practised by. To bee shorte, they frame themselues to doe, to leaue, to chaunge, to correct many things according to the iudgement of others. But sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wée haue alreadie at large discoursed, of the greate force, whiche vniuersall opinions haue for the amendement of our life, I will stande no longer vppon that point, and séeing wée are assured that our iudgements, and the knowledge of our selues, dependeth of the iudgement and conuersation of many, I will enter to speake of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of conuersation abroade: wherein, for the reasons and respectes wée alledged yesterday, I will haue regarde to the common profite, and specially of those of small vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, minding not to searche thorowly the morall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues whiche euery one can not comprehende, but to set foorth onely the principall points, whiche are required in this conuersation. Neyther will I in any wise mount to the toppe of trées, but satisfying in some parte so learned a man as you are, for the rest, I make account to speake to persons of weake capacitie, and therefore I will indeuour to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:6169:59"/>
present them with such thinges as are not out of their reach.</p>

               <p>Your discourses shall so much the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent mée, by how much the more they shalbe familiar, and suche as are méete for the weakenesse of my vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>

               <p>It is but your modestie to say so. Nowe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming first to the generall points, I am perswaded that the knowledge and contemplation of nature is imperfect in man, if actions bée not thereto adioyned. And therefore if to students which liue in contemplation, conuersation bée necessarie, it is no doubt muche more necessarie to those whiche haue no learning at all: Who, that they may not remaine as brute beastes, but bée knowen to differ from them, ought to indeuour to learne that at the mouth of another, whiche by their owne studie they can not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine vnto. Like as then it is reported, that certaine people vsed to dresse and heale those that were sicke openly in the stréetes, and béeing carefull of their health, demaunded of those which passed by, if they knewe any remedie for their diseases: so the solitarie man, who is in very déede sicke, and bereft of the knowledge whiche is gotten by the proofe of other mens iudgement, hath néede to séeke remedie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade out of the house. And though perchance hee méete with some more sicke then himselfe, and with others per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps incurable, yet let him not cease to goe forwarde, vntil such time hée finde such as are in health to comforte him, and Phisitions to heale him. Hauing respect to the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of him which saide, <hi>Of the wise thou shalt learne to make thy selfe better, of fooles, to make thy selfe more aduised.</hi>

               <p>Though men were not induced to goe foorth of their house and frequent the companie of others, for the causes by you alledged, yet I warrant you there want not other spurres, which pricke them forwarde into compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,
<pb facs="tcp:6169:60"/>
and make them presse into places where they sée the greatest throng of people: for the desire to maintaine and increase their wealth, and to mende their estate, will not suffer men to stande ydle with their handes at their gyrdels, whiche you shall plainely see, if you once set your foote in the Court of some Prince, where you shall sée an infinite number of Courtiers assemble to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to talke and deuise of many matters, to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stande the newes of the death or confiscation of the goods of some one, to seeke to obtaine of the Prince, eyther promotions, goods, pardons, exemption, or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge for them selues or others: and before they will craue suche thinges, to procéede thereto by meanes, and to practise the fauour of the Secretaries, and other Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. And you shall haue there besides, other good fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, conspyring together, and secretly deuising howe to bring some Officer into the disfauour of his Prince, that hée may bée put from his office, and some other placed in his roome. And if this bée not ynough to giue you to vnderstande the pleasure whiche is receiued by these com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, beholde the preasse of people whiche heapeth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the iudgement place, as oftentymes it hath béen my happe to see in the great Palace of the Parliament of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> whiche sounding with an infinite number of voices, while the plaintif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But why alledge I forraine examples, let vs passe only thorow the middest of this Citie, and wée shall sée not only on dayes appointed for trauaile, but on those also whiche are consecrated to the honour and seruice of God, a numberlesse multitude walking vpp and downe in euery place, kéeping a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall mercate, where there is no other talke but of buying and selling, of chopping and chaunging, of letting and taking money to interest, and in summe, there is bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayning for all thinges, whiche are fit to heale the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases

               <p>By this your spéeche, you haue brought to my remembraunce a place of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> where hée sayde that this worlde was nothing else but a verie mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, where there méete thrée sortes of men, the one to buy, the other to sell, and the thirde to looke on, who (hée sayde) were the Philosophers, whom hee counted the happiest of them all.</p>

               <p>Another vsed likewyse to say, that this world was a stage, wée the players whiche present the Comedie, and the gods, the lookers on, amongest whom belike hee comprehended the Philosophers. But for that at this day there are fewe diuine lookers on, and that wée whiche are the players, are in a manner all of vs giuen to play those partes which you haue spoken of, I will propose vnto you a kinde of conuersation, not to stande vs chiefly in stéede in markets, Comedies, and other outwarde things subiect to fortune, but to the ende wée may thereby learne good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and conditions, by meanes whereof, the giftes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune are distributed and conserued, and the fauour and good will of others obtained.</p>

               <p>Béeing so, that the solitary person is sicke, I prescribe for his health this medicine, that for a long tyme, hée indeuour by conuersation to bring to passe, that the reuenewes of his house bée farre greater then the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense.</p>

            <sp>

then those which spare niggardly. And if you call to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, the doings vsed of olde tyme in Rome, you shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue that to gratifie, and giue to many persons, was a meane whereby the loue and good will of the people was gotten, and it serued as a ladder, to climbe to the highest dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and promotions.</p>

               <p>A wise man béeing asked, why nature hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vs twoo eares, and but one tongue: to that ende (answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red hée) that wée shoulde heare muche, and speake little. That answere gaue mée occasion, to attribute to the eares, the reuenewe, and to the tongue, the expence. And to the ende I may bée better vnderstoode, I say, that in conuersati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the vse of twoo things is chiefly requisite, that is, of our tongue, and of our behauiour: wherefore let vs consider of those twoo parts.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Guaz.</speaker>
               <p>Why will you restraine your selfe only to those two parts?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>For that if you marke it well, wée winne chiefly the friendship and good will of other, by the manner of our spéech, and by the qualitie of our conditions: yea I might in a certaine manner reduce al conuersation, to that point of manners and behauiour, wherein are likewise co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prysed our woordes and spéech. But for so much as some parte of our talke doeth not wholy depende of manners and behauiour, I wil speake distinctly of those two points. And to enter into the matter, I say, that like as those which are sicke in body, loue and lust after those thinges, which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the saying of the Poet,
<q>
                     <l>Are toothsome to the taste, but hindersome to health.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>So the ignorant man of weake vnderstanding, which hath néede to kéepe silence, is meruaylously delighted to heare him selfe speake: and suche force hath this fault, that alwayes those whiche knowe least, couet to speake most. Séeing then to stay the tongue, and vse the eare, are the hardest things that may bée<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it behooueth our patient to frame him selfe too brydle his appetyte,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:6169:61"/>
withstanding his owne will, and inuring himselfe by little and little, to kéepe the mouth more shut, and the eares more open. Which hee shall no sooner doe, but hée shall perceiue that in companie hée shall get the good will and fauour of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, aswell by giuing eare curteously, as by speaking pleasantly. For wée thinke, they thinke wel of vs, which are attentiue to our talke, and wée sée our pleasant spéeche serueth vs to no purpose, if it bee not hearde of others. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, our sicke man shall beginne by holding his peace, to recouer his health, and to bée well thought of, of the wise. It was therefore that <hi>Pithagoras</hi> bounde his schollers to kéepe silence, for the space of thrée yéeres, considering that by their diligent giuing eare vnto him, they shoulde bée aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised of their owne ignorance, and printing in their hearts the profoundnesse and grauitie of his sentences, they should féele the profite of their patience: according to the old saying, <hi>That to a diseased minde, the witty woordes of others serue for a Phisition:</hi> and in the ende they shoulde know, that it is no lesse admirable, to knowe howe to holde ones peace, then to know how to speake. For, as wordes wel vttered, shewe eloquence and learning, so silence well kept, sheweth pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and grauitie.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Guaz.</speaker>
               <p>I remember I haue hearde tell, that one béeing asked, whether ignorance was the cause of his silence: an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered, That it was incide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t alwayes to the ignorant, not to know how to be silent.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>And therefore men of meane wit are the more to bée commended, if they speake not much: Wherevpon it is said, That it is a péece of wisedome for a man to hide his follie, by holding his tongue: and it is likewise sayd, That hée knoweth ynough, who knoweth nothing, if hée knowe how to holde his peace. Wée will then conclude, * that hee who knoweth not how to holde his peace, knoweth not howe to speake, * and hée that will learne to speake aduisedly, must giue eare to those which know howe to doe it, remembring that as hunger and thirst is an emptinesse of the body, so is ignorance an emptinesse of the minde: and as the body is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb facs="tcp:6169:62"/>
with foode, so the minde is fedde with vnderstanding: which as wée saide yesterday, is sooner gotten by hearing one speake, then by reading of bookes. And therefore hee ought to count it no labour to listen to others, nor shame to aske that which hée is ignorant in: but hée ought rather to i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitate that worthie personage, who vsed to say, I question with euerie man, but I answere no man, for that I knowe not how to frame a fit answere to anything.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Guaz.</speaker>
               <p>I am not ignorant that it behoueth one without learning, to speake little, and heare much, and I knowe that by long obseruation of the sentences and discourses of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, hée must néedes learne many things: but nowe you haue taught him the profite hée is to make by brydling his tongue, I looke you shoulde set him downe the charges hée is to be at, in speaking.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>As money well imployed, turneth both to the commoditie of him that receiueth it, and likewise of him that disburseth it: so woordes well considered, bring prefite to the hearer, and prayse to the speaker. And as out of one purse are drawen diuerse kindes of coyne, as of golde, sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, and baser mettall: so out of the mouth procéede senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and woordes of different value. But as it is not lawefull to forge or pay out naughtie mony, so neither is it lawefull to inuent, or speake that thing whiche may turne to the preiudice or reproche of others: For by such forgerie a man not onely shameth himselfe, but besides, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth his own life in daunger, which together with his death, is in the power of the tongue. Moreouer, it is written that * the tongue is a little fire, which kindleth greate mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, * and that he which kéepeth and represseth his tongue. kéepeth his owne soule. Wherefore we haue to conclude, that hée which wisheth to bée well spoken of by others, must take héede hée speake not ill of others. Therefore let him who hath his tongue in his mouth, bee at this point, that though he can not vtter graue and delightfull spéeches, like vnto Philosophers and Oratours, who are very scant
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:6169:62"/>
in the worlde, yet hée speake honestly and plainely, as an honest and Christian man ought to doe, * remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring alwayes that is better to slip with the foote, then with the tongue. *</p>

               <p>As I thinke, I haue read that a king of Egypt, to prooue the iudgement of <hi>Solon,</hi> sent him a beast to sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, inioyning him to choose out that part of the beast which he iudged best, and that which hee iudged worst, to sende backe vnto him. <hi>Solon</hi> to accomplish the kings hestes, sent him only the tongue.</p>

               <p>And therefore the tongue is rightly compared to the sterne of a shippe, which béeing the least parte of it, yet is it of force to saue or sinke the shippe. But of those which put the shippe in daunger of drowning, and which by the venome of their mischieuous tongues procure hurte to others, and blame to themselues, wée spake yesterday suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, in so much that wée haue already excluded them out of the number of the good and desirable: wherefore those which aspire to the degrée of vertue, and which will shewe themselues woorthie to bée admitted into ciuile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, ought aboue all things to haue regarde that they offende no man with their tongue. But they shall not bée quite discharged of their debt, if besides that, they doe not with their woordes, séeke to profite and delight their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers both together, to the ende they may reape all the fruite which the tongue can yeelde: For that the tongue by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structing, conferring, disputing, and discoursing, doth gather, assemble, and ioyne men together with a certaine naturall bonde. Hée then that will behaue himselfe wel in ciuile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation, must consider that the tongue is the mirrour, and (as it were) the image of his minde. And that like as wee knowe goodnesse or naughtinesse of mony, by the sounde of it: so by the sounde of woordes, we gather the inwarde qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and conditions of the man. And for that wee are so much the more estéemed of, by howe muche our Ciuilitie differeth from the nature and fashions of
<pb facs="tcp:6169:63"/>
the vulgar sorte, it is requisite that wée inforce our tongue to make manifest that difference in two principall thinges: in the pleasant grace, and the profounde grauitie of woordes.</p>

               <p>I vnderstande you, your meaning is, that as the poore people spende nothing but liards, and other such lyke small monye, so hée whom you speake of, shoulde vse no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mony but gold, which is the fairest in shewe, and best in substance. Yet (if I bée not deceiued) you are contrary to your selfe, for you tolde mée not long since, that it was y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to vse plaine and simple speeche, and nowe you will haue him speake with eloquence and wisedome. But séeing you haue saide that there are amongst vs but fewe Orators and Philosophers, howe shall I, and such as I am doe, that haue no golde to spende, and who can not in companie be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Demosthenes</hi> or <hi>Plato.</hi> Is it your minde wee shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to the schoole, to learne Rhetorike and Philosophy?</p>

               <p>I will neuer vnsay, that I haue once said, but I make good, that a man ought to procéede in common talke simply and plainly, according as the truth of the matter shal require: notwithstanding, if you consider how in Uillages, Hamlets, and fields, you shall finde many men, who though they leade their life farre distant from the graces and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses (as the prouerb is) and come stamping in with their high clouted shooes, yet are of good vnderstanding, whereof they giue sufficient testimonie by their wise and discréete talke: you cannot denie, but that nature hath giuen and sowed in vs certaine séedes of Rhetorike and Philosophie. But for that the more those good partes appeare in a man, the better hée is accepted in all companies, I would haue him aide na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with a little art, and séeke to furnish himself with such good giftes, that he make himselfe place, bee desired, honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and estéemed in any honest companie hée shall come in.</p>

               <p>Yea Syr, but take héede least eloquence bée not counted natural, by diuers woorthy persons, yea and it is much misliked of, when it swarueth from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon phrase

and fourme of spéech, which we vse with wife, children, ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes and friendes. For that wee ought to be content to expresse our minde without affectation, without paine, and without any pompe: For if any of those be added, it is besides the trueth, and sheweth a superfluitie of woordes, whose proper office ought to bee only to vtter our conceiued mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. And in trueth, wherefore serue so many perephrases and circumlocutions, so many translations and figures, béeing able to set foorth matters, and touche them brieflie, in proper and plaine termes. In my minde it may be saide, that these professours of eloquence, vnder the colour of an Oratour, playe the parte of a Poet: and by the feigning of woordes, shewe the little plaine dealing that is in them.</p>

               <p>To make you answere, I must aske you this question, whether you thinke the men of olde time to haue spoken better, or these of our time?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Guaz.</speaker>
               <p>These of this age in my fansie, for that it is easie to bewtifie and amplifie things, when they are once brought in.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>I am of your minde, for that in times paste they had not suche rules to direct them in speaking, as now adayes are set downe: they had not such Art and Methode, nor suche meane to helpe them selues with Proemes, or by disposing and deuiding of their matters, or by proouing them by places and argumentes: but for all this, you must not thinke but that our manner of speaking is as naturall as theirs was.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Guaz.</speaker>
               <p>I count it naturall, for so muche as the rude spéeche of the countrie Clowne, is as naturall to him, as the fine and polished, is to the Citizen and Gentleman.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>You see then euerie thing to be naturall, which nature consenteth to haue made better and more perfect: and therefore as it is a thing vnséemely and vnnaturall in talke to straie to farre from fit and vsuall matters, so it can not but be commended and saide to bee naturall, when in ones talke to necessarie thinges some what is added, whereby
<pb facs="tcp:6169:64"/>
the matter is amended. And for so muche as all men na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally indeuour them selues in spéeche, to persuade and to mooue, it is certaine that a sentence hath so much the more or lesse force and vigour, according to the difference of persons from whom it commeth, and of the words by which it is vttered. So that our chiefe labour must bee to mooue the heartes of the hearers: and wée must weigh this, that nothing can enter into their hearts, which is not currantly spoken, and without offence to the eares: and therefore wée must labour to haue (as <hi>Bias</hi> saide) a comely grace in hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding our peace, and a liuely force in speaking.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Guaz.</speaker>
               <p>If then your meaning be wée shoulde mooue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and persuade mens mindes with the tongue, you can not chuse but you must haue recourse to the preceptes of Rhethorike, which are not for euery mans capacitie.</p>

to those high and profound secrets, which are as it were in the marow and pith of the institutions of Rethorike, we will laye before them those things, which at the least grow about the Barke. For though they bée not of great price, yet neuerthelesse they shall be of great profite to the diseased.

               <p>I am fully of your minde, and thereof it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that many times certaine verses like vs verie well, and séeme to be set foorth with all the pleasant vaine of Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, when we heare some tumbler or Dauncer sing them to the Harp, but if you come to read, them afterwards, you wil think the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sottish &amp; vaine.

<pb facs="tcp:6169:65"/>
who in speaking are verie well liked of, and no fault to be founde in them, but let them come to writing any thing, and they are no bodie. But that we haue no meruayle héere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, I must say vnto you, that those same persons are not in deede eloquent, but that all their force and vertue lieth in the swéete deliuerie of their wordes, which though they bee neither well placed, neither verie pithie or sententious, yet they make to the eares and the minde a most delightfull Harmonie, which possesseth vs in suche sorte, that wee nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther searche after, nor desire for any thing besides.</p>

               <p>Then it is no meruayle on the contrarie, that many knowe howe to vse pure and fine filed spéeche, and yet want the gift of pronuntiation, which is so yl in them, that thereby their woordes loose their grace and authoritie.

               <p>I consider first of all, that the first part of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on consisteth in the voice, which ought to measure it forces, and to moderate it selfe in suche sort, that though it straine it selfe somewhat, yet it offend not the eares by a rawe and harshe sownde, like as of stringes of instrumentes when they breake, or when they are yll striken.</p>

               <p>Nexte, wée must take héede to bring forth our woordes distinctly, and to separate the sillables: mary in suche sorte that wée set not foorth euerie letter, as litle chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren doe when they learne to reade, which is a verie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasant hearing.</p>

               <p>Yet herein is required such a moderation, that a man with too litle be not immoueable like an image, neither with too much, too busie like an Ape: and as the one stirring no parte, thinking to get the opinion of grauitie, incurreth the suspition of folly, and is taken for a feigned person, brought in to speake, hauing of him selfe no life, so the other by the libertie of his iestures, thinking to vse a plausible kinde of curtesie, whereby to winne fauour, speaketh a playerlike kinde of lightnesse, whereby hée getteth discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation.

               <p>Moreouer, sometimes suche matters come in talke, wherein negligent carelessenesse in wordes, is more acceptable then diligent curiousnesse: and nowe and then common and familiar wordes, set foorth the matters which are handled, farre better then Tragicall and stately words doe. I mainteine not for all this, that a man néede take no care howe hée speaketh: for it is a thing as blame worthie to speake dissolutely, as to speake difficultlie: and it is as great a fault in common and knowne matters to vse curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affectation, as it is in great and waightie matters to

But I will say thus much vnto you, that is a most commendable course for a prince to take, whom perchaunce it better beseemeth to haue superficiall sight in diuerse languages and sciences, then to be deeplie séene in one onely. For many people of diuerse nations and professions, hauing many important occasions of dealing with him in person, it seemeth meete for his maiestie (not so much for an ornament to himselfe, as vniuersall benifite) to haue of all thinges, if it be possible, a certaine superficiall knowledge.

               <p>Make account that all which hath béen sayde hythervnto, apperteineth only to the pleasure of the eare, &amp; is but externall, and without. Nowe wee haue to consider more déepely, such thinges as are conuenient for education and manners requisite in ciuile conuersation. For <hi>Diogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> vsed to say, That the Mathematicians behelde the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen and the starres, but saw not that which lay before their féete: and that Orators study to speake wel, but doe it not. Hauing then set down in our ciuil conuersation y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> purity of
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:6169:75"/>
spéech, we must now co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> that is not sufficient, without the puritie and sinceritie of manners. And therefore euery one ought to labour, to conforme his minde and affections to his wordes, yea and hauing not the gift of pure spéech, hée ought to supplie that defect, with the puritie and simplicitie of manners. And therevpon that graunde Captaine <hi>Marius,</hi> speaking before the people of Rome, sayde, My woordes are not well set in order, but I waygh not that much, so that my déedes bée good.

               <p>Your conclusion in briefe is, that to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in companie, a man must indeuour to be a <hi>Grecian</hi> in wordes, and a <hi>Romane</hi> in déedes.</p>

Amongst the whiche (to growe nowe to the matter) I woulde wishe euery one that séeketh to winne credite in companie, to resolue with him selfe aboue all thinges (whiche very fewe folke doe) to followe that excellent and diuine counsell of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who béeing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded which was the readiest way for a man to winne honour and renowme: answered, <hi>To indeuour,</hi> to bee such a one in deede, as hée desireth to séeme to bee in shewe.</p>

There are then diuers wayes to auoyde it: the first is, that the tongue goe not before the wit. And as women before they present themselues to the view of others, prie in their glasse, and take counsayle and assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance therof: so before wée vtter our wordes, we must haue recourse to the inward glasse, that wée may order and place them in such sorte, that the hearers may not iudge, that they take their beginning rather from the mouth, then from
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:6169:76"/>
the heart, and that they are rather shot foorth at all aduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures rashly, then vttered with reason aduisedly. Of this premiditation this good shall come, that no man will aduenture to speake of thinges hée knoweth not, as the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant commonly doe. For according to the opinion of a wise man, he that speaketh he knoweth not what, play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a manner the parte of a madde man, and falleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fault that <hi>Alexander</hi> the great did, who reasoning of painting in the house of <hi>Apelles,</hi> and vsing spéeches imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent and contrarie to that art, the wise Painter whispe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him in the eare, that hée shoulde speake no more of that matter, or els that he shoulde speake softly, for that his prentices laught him to scorne.</p>

               <p>This fault is hatefull in company, and offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth greatly him which speaketh. Touching this, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber howe a Gentleman began to rehearse in a certaine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, the order and solemnitie of the mariage of the Duke my maister, whereat hée was present: and while hee was speaking, one of the hearers almost at euerie worde woulde put in his speake in the matter, thereby to shewe, that hée well vnderstood the whole matter: the Gentleman hauing borne long enough with this vndiscréete dealing, at the length paused a litle, and saide, My maisters, it séemeth to mée, that this Gentleman knoweth the whole matter bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then I, and therefore I will leaue it to him, thorowly to recount it vnto you. This digression, as you may imagine, made my Gentleman pull in his hornes, and to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his fault, so that without speaking a worde more, hée suffered the other Gentleman to go forwarde, and to make an end of his matter.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>Certaine it is, that wee ought not to interrupt him which speaketh, but rather with a certaine modestie to take sometime that which he saieth, for newes, though eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one knewe it before. But this interrupting of an other, were but a small matter, if a greater inconuenience did not
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:6169:77"/>
insue of it. For that he which hath not the patience to giue eare to that which is spoken, oftentimes taketh wordes in other sense then they are spoken. Wherein he resembleth a Dogge, who hearing one knocke at the doore, barketh by and by, before he know whether it be a friend or an enemy, that is there. Wherof arise controuersies without cause, and much confusion, which should not happen if the hearer were more discréete, and woulde attend the end of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So that we may well say, that those which are impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to heare, are rashe to iudge, and are likewise ouerha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie Iudges: who either by persuasion, or by affection are induced to pronounce sentence, before they heare what ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part can say for them selues.</p>

               <p>Right, we wil say then, according to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a <hi>Grecian,</hi> that to couet to speake alwayes, and neuer to heare others, is a kinde of tyrannie, so that in talke the speaker and the hearer ought to agrée to kéepe turnes as it were, like as they doe at tennis. Besides, one that can qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly heare an other speake, sheweth howe he liketh to haue the truth euidently and quietly opened in euery matter: and that he can not away with vnaduised and contentious argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And therevpon it is saide, That to vse silence in time and place, passeth all well speaking: and that it ought to be put in the number of the Philosophicall vertues. For as the Oratour is not knowne but only by speaking, so the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher
<pb facs="tcp:6169:78"/>
is no lesse knowne by modest silence, then by his graue sentences. * Therefore I would wish euery one in speaking so to vse the matter, that it may séeme he is rather vrged to speake of necessitie, then desirous to doe it volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily. Imitating that wise man, who is commended for thrée especiall vertues: the one, that hee neuer tolde lye, the other, that he neuer spoke yll of any, and the third, that hee neuer spoke but vpon necessarie occasion *. Wherevpon I conclude, that in companie euerie one ought to obserue two speciall times to speake: the one, when thinges come in question which hee vnderstandeth perfectly well, and hath at his fingers endes as it were: the other, when such mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters arise, as hee must néedes speake of. In these twoo cases, it is better to speake then to bee silent, in all other, hee that shall vse silence shall choose the best way: and auoiding that vaine and counterfeite seeming, shall winne greater commendation.</p>

               <p>Neither yet for all that, doe I thinke it meete, for any to be hasty to speake of all thinges that he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standeth and knoweth perfectly, but to goe slowly forwarde in them, and to weigh whether they concerne his calling, or not. For albeit, by reason of my continuall sicklinesse, I haue been driuen to bestowe some time in the studie of Galen, yet for that my cheefe profession is not that way, I shoulde be misliked if I shoulde playe the Phisition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest Phisitions, and enter into any deepe discourse of phisicke.</p>

               <p>It is no doubt an odious thing for a man to take vppon him sufficiencie, and to be pratling in euery matter.

And therefore it were not séemely for you to take occasion to speake of Phisicke: and if occasion shal
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:6169:78"/>
be giuen you, you may speake of it in way of doubting, or demaunding some question: manifesting by that mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie, that you haue more desire to vnderstande that you knowe not, then to vtter that you knowe. Wherefore euerie one ought to consider what opinion other men haue of him, and in what matters they will willingly heare him, and easily giue credite to him, and in no wise to meddle in any other matters.</p>

               <p>Marie for that purpose, sinceritie and playne dealing is especially good, a thing verie commendable and necessarie, not only in déedes, but euen in woordes like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. For many, to the ende they may be taken for others then they are, vse to shadowe the trueth, and when they thinke to winne credite, in the ende by some meanes or other, they bewray them selues to bée lyers and cogging mates, and by their false dealing loose their credite. And though this faulte bée committed in diuers sortes, yet mée thinkes it is too too intollerable, when a man attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to him selfe that whiche belongeth to others. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the example of the Flye, whiche sitting vppon a Carte that was driuen on the way, saide, hée had raysed a verie great dust: * or like the Emote, who sitting on the horne of an Oxe that was tilling the grounde, beeing askte what hée did there, answered, that hée went to plough. *</p>

Wée must therefore haue reuerent regarde of the trueth, and take héede that we violate not the virgini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie thereof in any sort, nor to pull so much as one haire from her, least wée sustaine shame thereby. And I will say vnto you more, that the trueth is a thing so tickle, that a man may incurre reprehension not only by disguising it in some parte colourably, but euen by verie reporting of it simply: which is, when men tell thinges which are true, but yet such as fewe will beléeue to be true.</p>

forbeare to speake of him selfe, and his owne dooings, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse some necessitie require it.

               <p>Like as in the night time, the more you fixe your eyes on the firmament, the greater number of starres you discouer, so the more wee consider the sayde sentence of <hi>Socrates,</hi> the more wayes wée finde out to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide this vaine séeming, and to bée well thought of in companie. Let vs say then againe, that a man ought to indeuour to bée suche a one, as hée desireth to séeme to bée, and wée shall thereby knowe that as naturally all men desire to bée had in honour and estimation, so in the most parte of men, that desire is vaine and foolishe, for that it is not founded vppon any desert, nor any vertue worthy of honour.</p>

               <p>Yea but they misse the marke they shoote at, for it commonly falleth out contrarie to their desire? for sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others to make no account of them, they beginne to set by them selues, and stirred vp with a foolishe disdaine, they put on a Lyons skin, and looke with a sterne and fierce coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance: By meanes whereof they become hatefull to all men. * But if according to the Philosopher they knew that honour did consist, rather in him which honoureth, then in him which is honoured, they would neuer take vppon them
<pb facs="tcp:6169:80"/>
so bigly, nor set them selues out so arrogantly, knowing that it is not in their power to bée honoured of them selues. * Wherefore, who so séeketh to bée had in reputation, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for wisedome, iustice, fortitude, or temperance, must examine well him selfe, whether any of these vertues be in him, otherwise his desire can not possiblye take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</p>

And where they count a prayse neuer to laugh, to bende the browes, to frowne, to looke terribly, and to vse rough spéech, they

               <p>The fault which is so committed by negligence or ouersight is too grosse, and there is no man that will so interprete it, and therefore they must resolue with them selues either to chaunge their manners, and not to bée so scant of their Cappes and salutations, (whiche profite muche without any cost) or els to hire a man of purpose to giue them notice of those whiche shall salute them, that they may remember to salute them againe. For these small trifles being respected, are of force to contract friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, and béeing neglected, they may dissolue that friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship whiche before was contracted.

               <p>And albeit it bée so, that this vertue bée séemely and commendable in all sortes of people, yet it shineth most brightly in those whiche are our Superiours, either in power or preeminence, when you receiue of them cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous spéeches, in suche sorte, that what by their gentle woordes, and what by their liuely lookes and chéerefull countenaunce, you vnderstande their affections, wheretoo your will doeth easily incline. I coulde héere alledge vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, the example of two brothers, Gentlemen of great calling, whereof the one for his gentle spéeche and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunt lookes, is greatly beloued of euerie one, and the other for his terrible countenaunce, and stately kinde of talke, is fauoured but of a fewe: In so muche, that some whiche fall in talke of them, say, * that if they were to request any thing at their handes, they shoulde remaine more pleasauntly satisfied with a deniall of the first, then with a graunt of the other.</p>

For to bée too populer and plausible, were to make lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesse of the treasures of his curtesie, to abase him selfe, and to shew a signe of folly or flatterie. Wherby a man against his will may shew himselfe sometime to be that he is not, &amp; giue
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:6169:81"/>
occasion to others to insult ouer him, and not to respect him so muche as they ought to doe. But I would wish men, so muche as is possible, to shewe at once the maiestie of a Philosopher in the grauitie of sentences, and the humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a Christian in the gentlenesse of woordes: hauing in minde, that curteous language multiplieth friendes, and mitigateth enemies, and that according to the prouerbe, The méeke Lambe sucketh the teates of his owne damme and of others also.</p>

               <p>I remember I haue read a sentence, not muche different from that, to wit, that hée which speaketh gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telly to his neighbour, receiueth of him a gentle answere, and out of the breastes where hée searched milke, bringeth out butter.</p>

               <p>* Assure your selfe it is euen so. But to be sure to reape this commoditie, it is requisite that this gentle spéeche come from the heart, and that it bée not intermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with some fonde iesture and behauiour, whiche may make it smell of flatterie, and in stéede of loue, purchase hate. Like as some doe, who by their continuall girning and shewing of their téethe, make men doubt whether they honour them, or laugh at them.</p>

And as that is a signe of curtesie, so this is a token of wit, and is vsed no lesse in iesting merily with others, then in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king iest patiently of others. There are diuers sortes of this pleasauntnesse, wherevppon both the Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers and Rhetoritians, séeing howe auaileable it is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshe mindes ouercharged with melancholy and pensiue

               <p>I beléeue well that arte and studie may helpe something in it, but in my iudgement, it is nature that must woorke chiefely. Whiche to bée true, appeareth by many men of great wisedome and learning, who in a pleasaunt matter haue no grace at all, and contrariwise, many ignorant men, euen of the common sorte, will han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a pleasaunt matter so finely, that they will make <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclitus</hi> him selfe laugh at it.</p>

               <p>I graunt vnto you, that according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie of natures, the actions of men are diuers, and that it is harde for one to mooue delight in others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a certaine naturall liuelinesse of spirite. But it is seldome séene that a man pleasauntly conceited, is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so sharpely witted. Which <hi>Gonella</hi> noteth, saying, That to playe the foole well, it behooueth a man first to be wise. But notwithstanding I am of opinion, that a man solemne by nature, may by vse get the habite of pleasauntnesse, and I am sure you will not denie mée, but that there are some in countenaunce and iesture verie graue and seuere, who in companie are pleasaunt and merie beyonde all measure. But it is better for a man not to alter his owne nature from grauitie, then to vse mirth immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destlye. For as the meane is commendable, so the extreames are detestable, and growe either to scurrilitie in vsing too licentious scoffing, or els to inciuilitie, in refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing all merie iesting. *</p>

to the foresaide saying of <hi>Socrates</hi>) wée take more pleasure to séeme then to bée: and wée thinke we shewe not such wit in amending our owne faultes, as in reprehending other mens.

               <p>There are two sortes of faults, the one, of those which are not full ripe, the other, of those whiche are tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe rotten. I call the vnrype ones, those whiche one is readie to commit, and the rype ones, those whiche are alreadie committed. Wée must staye the committing of the first so muche as wée may, for the other, some are to bée excused, some to bee blamed. If then wée perceiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in reasoning, to bee driuen into so narowe a straite, that hée can not easily get out of it, without committing some absurditie either in wordes or in matter, it shall bée our parte discréetely to preuent him. And (as one that stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at a stone is readie to fall downe) readily to take holde of him and staye him vp: not staying till hee fall, to make the companie fall a laughing, and him selfe to bée ashamed. In dooing whereof, wée assure him, which spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, of the good account wée make of him, and giue him to vnderstande howe iealous wée are of his honour, in suche sort, that wée make him thereby verie friendly affectioned towardes vs: whereas on the contrarie, there is nothing that setteth him sooner in a rage, and maketh him to alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate his good will from vs, then to thinke him selfe had in contempt, and to be flouted at.</p>

               <p>This contempt in my opinion is intollerable: for that there is no man that thinketh so vilely and abiectly of himselfe, that hée deserueth to bée scorned. And in my o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, besides that, it is no good manner to mocke another, hée is also in daunger to receiue the like, or a greater mocke himselfe: For suche a blowe as the Asse giueth against the

And if it bée a fault to floute such as one knoweth, it is a greater fault to deride those hée knoweth not, whiche some rashe and insolent fellowes vse to doe, who (as the saying is) iudging the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses by the sadles and furnyture, * consider not that oft times vnder a clownishe coate, is hidden a noble and liuely vnderstanding.</p>

               <p>To conclude, it is a perilous thing to mock and scoffe at others, and, as the saying is, To anger a Waspe: And therefore it is not good to mocke any man in any maner of wyse. For if hée bée our better, or equall, hée will by no meanes abide that wée shoulde abiectly estéeme of him. If hée bée our inferiour, wée make him thereby to withdrawe his good wil from vs, which is an yll matter: For wée ought to indeuour to make euery one (if it bée possible) friendly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectioned towards vs. Now if it fall out that another ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoote himselfe in talke, wée must consider whether it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céede of vnskilfull foolishnesse, or of wilfull naughtinesse, for the first, wée ought to excuse it, or discréetely to séeke to hyde it, without iesting at it, as some scoffing merchantes, which are altogether voide of wit, vse to doe: for as it is an yl thing to make a scoffe at that which is well done, so is it a cruell and odious thing to scoffe at that which is yll done by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or ouersight.

As it is not lawfull for euerie one either for lacke of authorite (as for a young man too reprehende an olde, or for one of lowe estate, one that is of highe calling) or else for that hee is sprinckled with the like or with greater imperfections (as for an adulterer, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke another for lasciuiousnesse,) or for lying. For as the Prouerbe is,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hee that mocketh the lame, must take heede that hee him selfe goe vpright.</hi> Likewise wée ought not to presume to correct any others, but those, with whom ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by consanguinitie, or by long familiaritie, wée haue credite and authoritie. To bée briefe, in reprehending, wée must not onely haue respect to the qualitie of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, but also of the places and times, and to consider both howe wée ought to vse reprehension, and howe our friend is disposed to receiue it. And therefore it is reported that one saying to another. Art thou not ashamed to bée drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in such sort? Hée answered, Art not thou ashamed to reprehende one that is drunke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>? In like case it were to no purpose, but woulde rather make him worse, to rebuke a swearer, while hee is in his rage, and in the presence of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Yet this aduertisement is not enough, but to vse déeper discretion in the matter, wée must vse an honest kinde of deceite, and intermingle with the bitternesse of reprehension, the swéetenesse of some prayse. Or wee muste blame others for those faultes whiche are in him whom wee seeke to refourme: or els reproue our selues as subiect too suche imperfections. Finally,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:6169:84"/>
we ought to reprooue our friende in suche sorte, that hee maye take it well, and thinke him selfe beehol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding too vs for it. As some Philosophers in their Morall woorkes haue taughte vs to doo, whiche shall suffice touching this pointe. Nowe touching other meanes pertayning to the obseruation of the sentence beefore set downe, if wee looke thorowely intoo it, wee shall finde that all those, whiche loue rather too bée, then to seeme to bee, will vse that foresaide discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in auoyding all quarrellous contentions and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate arguyng in matters, whereby a man, desirous of that vayne seeming, will often times, contrarye to all reason, seeke to seeme to haue the vpper hande of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>

               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>And therefore if hee which speaketh, saye the trueth, wee ought too contente our selues so well with his woordes, as if they were holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: And if hee chaunce too vtter any vntrueth, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then too stande in contention with him (so that it no way preiudice vs) we ought modestlye too beare with it: Obseruing alwayes the rule of <hi>Epictere,</hi> who sayd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that in companie wee must yeelde humbly too our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour, perswade gently with our inferiour, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree quietly with our equall. And by that meanes there shall neuer bee any falling out.</p>
               <p>Nowe I meane too tell you howe a manne ought too behaue him selfe in such ceremonies as are requisite in companie.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Guaz.</speaker>
               <p>I should thinke it wisedome to vse no ceremonies at all in companie, for so much as they procéede rather of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious vanitie, then of faythfull affection: and in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the more a man vseth them, the lesse plaine dealing is thought to be in him. Wheras on the contrary, when you
<pb facs="tcp:6169:85"/>
sée one goe plainely to woorke both in woordes and iesture, you say by and by, that he is a good honest meaning man. For my part I weigh it little, that my equall, hauing the wall of me, should goe from it to giue me place: I had rather haue him beare me more goodwill, and doe me lesse honour. And as you cannot but laugh to sée a farre off a number of folke, skipping, leaping, &amp; daunsing, you hearing no sowne of instrument: so it must néedes make you merry, to sée a farre two persons vse diuerse iestures and ceremonies of the head, the handes, the knées, and wrying their whole bodie, not hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any woorde they say. I will not say vnto you, that for one which hath a good grace in these ceremonies, there are a thousand whom it be commeth so ill to vse them, that it will make you sicke at the heart to sée it: and you shall see some of them goe so vntowardly to woorke, that coueting to bee courtlike, they become plaine cartlike. As I haue séene some talking with the Duke my maister, and séeing him bare headed, haue taken his arme with both their handes, and made him put on his hat.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>He should haue put it of againe, to haue shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he was not bare in respect of them, but because of the heate.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Guaz.</speaker>
               <p>But there was another behaued himselfe some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what better, who talking with the Duke being vncouered, tooke his cap foorth of his hand, and put it vppon his head. So that I say againe, that I can in no way away with these ceremonies, which are no lesse vnseemely in worldly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, then they are conuenient in sacred and diuine thinges.</p>

               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>Those same (and beleeue me) openly detest them, but secretly desire them: and if you well consider the matter thorowly with your selfe, you shall knowe that ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies displease no bodie. For this is certaine, that they
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:6169:85"/>
are doone in signe of honour, and there is not hée, who is not glad with all his hearte to bee honoured, and who ought not to bée glad to honour another, for so muche as (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the saying of the Philosopher) hée whiche honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, receiueth more honour, then hee whiche is honoured, for like vnto the Sunne, the beames of honour by reflexion, as it were, doe shine backe againe vppon him. And as hée whiche is ceremonious may bée thought to bée a dissembler, so hée whiche is not so, may bée taken to bée a clowne, a ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desby, or a contemner of others. I will not say that they doe yll whiche pray you to vse no ceremonies in respect of them, but I rather commende them: For their very say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so, is a certaine kinde of Ceremonie and behauiour, whereby they goe about to couer their ambition, and it is according to the fashion of Phisitions, who for manner sake sometime refuse money with their mouth, but take it with their hearte, and finger it with their handes. And as the sacred Ceremonies, which are veide of superstition, are not displeasant in Gods sight, and stirre vp to deuotion the mindes of the ignorant people, whiche are not come to the perfect knoweledge of Gods worde: so these worldly ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies purchase vs the good will of our friendes and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours, to whom they are addressed, and make vs knowne for ciuile people, and from rude countrie loutes.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>Mary in such sort, that he which vseth them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wray thereby the affection of his heart, that the inward loue may bée knowne, as well as the outwarde honour is séene, otherwise ceremonies are lothsome vnto vs, and shew that the hearte is faigned. And on the other side, it is the parte of him whiche receiueth these outwarde honours, first, modestly to refuse them, shewing thereby that hée looketh not for them, otherwise hée shall shewe to bée somewhat proude, which is most hurtful in conuersation: And besides, you knowe well that your equall doth honour vnto you, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of curtesie, then of dutie, and when you shal accept those
<pb facs="tcp:6169:86"/>
honours as due vnto you, and as of your inferiour, you shall make him care but a little what reuerence hée sheweth vnto you. To bée short, wée must receiue honour at our friends handes, rather as offered by them, then looked for by vs: and it is not amisse to follow the example of that discrete gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who, after long strife betwéene him and certaine of his friendes, who should first enter into the house, saith, You may nowe knowe well howe muche I am at your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde, séeing I am ready to obey you in thinges which turn to my dishonor: which said, he entred in without stray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning curtesie any longer.</p>

               <p>I allowe the reasons alleadged by you to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Ceremonies, but I will say vnto you, that they ought to bée obserued rather amongest strangers, then familiar friendes. For if I bée not deceiued, true friendship can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way neither with Ceremonious wordes nor déedes.</p>

               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>I am in déede of your minde, that from true friendship, Ceremonies shoulde be taken. But where at this day are those true friendes to bee found? Know you not that according to the Philosopher, Perfect friendshippe extendeth not towardes diuers persons, but is restrained to the loue of one alone? I knowe not who is your assured friende, but I am sure that I haue not yet founde mine, with whom I might vse suche open, simple, and frée beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour as you meane. For you must thinke it a harde mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to finde in the worlde two heartes which loue perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And though in token of true friendship, you call your companion brother, perchaunce hee shall haue no minde to tearme you so: and to take that custome from you, hée wyll call you Maister <hi>Guazzo.</hi> And that you may not vse too familiar spéeche to him, hée will speake to your worship in suche sorte, that you shall bée faine to retyre one steppe backe, and vse him rather Ceremoniously then louingly. Of this common course of the world I gather, that those with whom wee are conuersaunt, being rather well willers, then true friendes, it is our partes to take
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:6169:86"/>
héede of too broade and to familiar behauiour with them, whereby wée may hazzarde to loose their good will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to followe the example of Flies, which will not become tame amongst vs, though they dayly dwell with vs, &amp; eate of our cates when wée doe.</p>

               <speaker>Guaz.</speaker>
               <p>I remaine satisfied of all that you haue spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. Nowe I consider with my selfe that this your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course comprehendeth generall matters, and agréeth to all sortes of persons. And therefore I woulde bee glad that you shoulde declare particularly the meanes that euery one ought to obserue, according to his estate and calling.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>Wee haue already saide, that it is a matter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to set downe particularly, what euery one ought to doe in companie, and therefore it shall suffice only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, that the thinges afore spoken, ought to bée common to all, like as the stréetes, the Churches, the Fountaines, and common Conduites are. But as euery one indeuoureth to get and appropriate to him, either house, landes, or moue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ables, in like sort, euery one in his order of life and conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, ought to propose vnto him selfe speciall lawes, and suche a kinde of behauiour as shall bée conuenient to his calling. But to reape the right fruite of conuersation, whiche consisteth chiefly in the good will of others, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, that wée knowe and learne not onely what belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to our selues, but also howe to behaue our selues to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes others, according to the difference of their estates, for that it is our hap to come in companie, somtime with the young, sometime with the olde, assoone with Gentlemen, assoone with the baser sorte, nowe and then with Princes, nowe and then with priuate persons, one while with the learned, another while with the ignoraunt, nowe with our owne Countriemen, then with strangers, nowe with the religious, then with the secular, nowe with men, then with women.</p>

               <p>I say then (as it were in passing by) that there are fewe to bée founde, whiche are not sicke of some of those diseases, whiche wée haue before mentioned, but the extrée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest sicke of all, are young men: For whose health it is requisite, that they shaue of from their face that counterfeite bearde, I meane that false seeming and vaine perswasion: remembring the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues, that as their faces are smooth &amp; bare without hear, so their heades are barren of vnderstanding. For if it bée true, that length of time bringeth experience, and that wisedome groweth of experience: it is moste true, that young men for lacke of yéeres and experience cannot bée wise: And thereof commeth the Prouerbe, <hi>That the Diuell is full of knowledge, because hee is olde.</hi> And therefore they ought to bridle their ouer rashe tongues, &amp; to vse chiefly silence in stéede of medicine, imprinting in their heartes this saying, That a young man shoulde hardly speake in his owne cause, though he bee in a manner vrged vnto it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Guaz.</speaker>
               <p>It is a common saying, that a young man is to be blamed, which will talke like an olde man, and a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which will speake like a man.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>Young men ought chiefely to kéepe this si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence when they are amongest olde men, whose companie is maruellous auayleable vnto them.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Guaz.</speaker>
               <p>It is so much behoofull to them, as it is for the most part hatefull to them, by reason of the diuersitie of complexions, fancies, and conditions, so that they flye from it so much as possibly they may, that they may inioy the

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>Men ought to conceiue so much the better opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of those young men, which willingly associate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with old men, for that they séeme to preue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t age, with vertue: and beginning by time to be wise, they continewe so a long time. Whereof it commeth, that easily, and before the tyme, as it were, with the good report they haue wonne, and the good deedes they haue done, they come to honour and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment. And therefore in my opinion, those young men which eschue the companie of old, hyde their woundes, and make them to fester inwardly. And contrariwyse, those which followe it, lay open their imperfections, and thereby receiue guerison.</p>

               <p>It is much better to acknowledge our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections in our youth, then in our age, for as the Poet sayth,

               <p>There is no doubt of it, but that young folke learne of old, by reason of their authoritie and wisedome, to moderate their burning desires, to acknowledge their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering inconstancie, and to correct their other naturall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections. And as, hauing occasion of farre trauayle into vnknowen Countries, wée addresse our selues to some one whiche knoweth the way to giue vs certaine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions of it: so likewise in this pilgrimage wée haue to make in this doutfull and deceitful life, wee can not doe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, then to bée informed of those which haue happily, as it were, reached to their iournies ende, to knowe what wayes wée ought to forsake, and what to take to come safely to the ende of our voyage: whiche is most daungerous to young folke, as the wiseman sayth, who, to the vncertaine flight of the Egle in the ayre, of the ship on the sea, and of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent on the rocke, addeth, as most vncertaine, the way of a yong man in his first yeres. Yong men therfore are to folow the companie of olde, and to make their account, that hee which frequenteth the wise, becommeth wise, and to imitate the youth of Rome, which had age in such reuerence, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery
<pb facs="tcp:6169:88"/>
one did honour to his elder, as to his parent. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwise it was counted a thing worthy punishement, if a yong man did no reuerence to an olde, or a childe to one at mans state. * Yea in some Countries, it is not lawe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for a young man to beare witnesse against his el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. * And in truethe it is reasonable that eche one make reuerent account of those whiche doe surmount them in age and vnderstanding. And as they seé their youngers ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them in respect that they are more auncient, so moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by that example, they ought to reuerence those whiche are their elders. But after other medicines méete for young mens health, I will for conclusion adde this, that as hee ought to auoyde bolde presumption, so hee ought in companie to bée indued with suche a modest shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastnesse, that his chéekes may nowe and then bée dyed with Uermilion, whiche will become him, and is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of a good nature, and a signe that he wil come to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>

               <p>I coulde neuer lyke of a young man that is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent.

               <p>The right olde men (to wit the wise) the née<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer they approch to their ende, the more delight they take in knowledge and vertue. Touching this, I would haue you call to minde the saying of him, whiche sayde that if hée had one foote within the graue, yet hee woulde still bée learning somewhat.

Yea wée may say, that a man neuer begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to knowe, vntil by age wée drawe towardes the ende of our life. Which a certaine philosopher sheweth very wel, who with lamentation complaineth of nature, for giuing a very long life to many reasonles creatures, vsing great libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie towards them, &amp; dealing very hardly with man, who is depriued of life, then when he beginneth to liue, that is, to vnderstand, and then when hee ought to inioy the fruites of his labours. But I meane not héere to discourse vnto olde folke, what is requisite for them to sustaine the burthen of age, and to arriue safely at the hauen and ende of misery and sorrowe: For that were to perswade my selfe foolishly that <hi>Cato</hi> had not spoken of that matter largely and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently. But I wil say vnto you, that many olde folke com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine without cause, that their age is smally regarded or reuerenced, and perswade themselues, for that they haue a whyte beard, for that they are bald, bleareyed, toothlesse, crooked, trembling, and sickly, that therfore al honor shoulde be due vnto them, and many of them sée not how voide they are of vnderstanding, vertue, and wisedome. And therefore they ought to consider, that olde age is not to bée respected or reuerenced for the number of their yéeres, but chiefly for the merite of their good conditions and Uertue: and therevppon it is sayde, that to bée
<pb facs="tcp:6169:89"/>
hoare heared, is a signe of yéeres, not of knowledge. And if I may say, that an old man without knowledge and vertue, is worthy no honour at all, for that it is a signe hee hath spent his youth in nothing that is commendable. Whiche is confirmed by this saying, that thrée sortes of men are odious to the world, a poore man proude, a riche man a lyar, and an old man a foole. Now touching conuersation, I woulde ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise old men to temper alwayes their falke with grauitie and wisedom, and for the most part to speake of those things which serue for example and instruction of life.</p>

But there may be here alledged another occasion, whiche is, that God will suffer no euil to remaine vnpunished. For a famous writer, speaking of the nobilitie of the world, maketh it nothing else then auncient richesse, and addeth, that euery rich man is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vniust him selfe, or else the heire of some vniust man. Wherevppon hée concludeth, that the gentry of ones house, taketh beginning of iniustice: and therefore wée must not meruaile if things ill gotten are ill spent. But to returne to my purpose, these halfe Gentlemen, who béeing not by nature indued with any veriue, make boast of the woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinesse of their auncestours, are to bée laughed at: For the more they set foorth the woorthinesse of them, the more they lay open the imperfection of themselues, for that there is nothing that maketh the childrens faultes more to bée séene, then the bright shewe and glorious shyning of their fathers and graundfathers. And no doubt hee that hath no commendable thing in him, the more he speaketh of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of his auncestours, the more vile and contemptible hée
<pb facs="tcp:6169:92"/>
sheweth himselfe. And therevpon it is growen into a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe that vnfortunate children extoll the vertues of their parents. God therefore kéepe vs from the state of these halfe Gentlemen, whose déedes béeing not answereable to the nobilitie of their house, they are little accounted of in the worlde, and taken as it were for Bastardes. Wherefore we will conclude that in veritie and trueth wée ought to respect the qualities and vertues whiche are in the parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, and that it is in vaine to stand vpon the renowme of our progenitours. Next vnto this first kind foloweth the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of Gentlemen by good conditions.</p>

But if you shal talke with a Gentleman that is so by birth, who by the helpe either of learning or of armes hath gotten this second gentry, he wil no doubt make more account of the gentry purchased by his owne vertue, then of that which is discended vnto him by birth.

But there was nothing in <hi>Fraunce</hi> which went more against my stomacke, then to see the Secretaries of noble men in so litle credite and reputation: whereas in <hi>Italy</hi> the Secretaries of Princes are had in great honor, and iustly for that they are partakers of their inward thoughtes, and the kéepers as it were vpon trust of their honor &amp; estimation. And in <hi>Fraunce</hi> he that hath a seruant which can coppie out writinges, and kéepe count of his reuenewes in a booke, he giueth him forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the name of Secretarie.</p>

Nowe to returne to my purpose, I say a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that the Gentleman by vertue, is more excellent then the Gentleman by birth. Yea I coulde say vnto you, that many count gentry by blood to bée foolish, and nothing at all: and amongst others a certaine wise man saide, that gentry of the minde, is, to bée indued with woorthy thoughts: and the gentry of the body, is the gentlemanlike minde: mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that the gentry of the body, was not to bée attributed to the house wée came of. Another Philosopher affirmeth likewise, that it is in vaine called gentry, whiche referring it selfe to the worthinesse of blood, is not ours, but others. And therefore the light of another cannot make mée shine, if there be no brightnesse in my selfe.</p>

               <p>A ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> may also adde here the saying of our <hi>Galen,</hi> that those who béeing voide of vertue themselues, haue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course to the cognisances and armes of their predecessours, sée not how that vaineglorie is like certaine kinde of coyne, which is currant in those townes and places where it hath béen stamped and made, but it cannot bée put away in other places, but is taken for counterfayte and naught. But I wil not here omit that which is excellently written in a letter, by his brother <hi>Frauncis Coronato,</hi> our <hi>Academike</hi> doctour in diuinitie, that they are to bée laughed at, whiche take so much vppon them, to put difference betwéene themselues and other, as if they had béen made by some other creatour
<pb facs="tcp:6169:94"/>

Yea the soule it self maketh no difference betwéene vs, for so much as wée come all of one father and creatour. But that which putteth a differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwéene vs, is the vertue of the minde. So that neither in respect of the master<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor of the fourme, nor of the mind, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered of it selfe, but in respect of the vertue gotten &amp; acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by our owne industry, wée are more excellent one then another. And therof we may nowe sée that touching the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, wée are all one thing, and as one sayde, wée are all made of durt: and as wée haue one selfe beginning, so haue wée likewise one selfe ende. Wherefore wée are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that gentry and renowme is not got by our birth, but by our life, yea and sometyme by our death, according to that saying,

               <p>I néed not vse many words to you touching that sorte, and it sufficeth to say, that those same get their gentry by custome: and that this gentry is so weake, that it exte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth not generally, but hath place only in some part.

And there fore according to that common o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, those same may be called Gentlemen in their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, but not else where.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Guaz.</speaker>
               <p>In few woordes, your minde is that those a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Italians, Spaniards, Frenchmen, Lombardes, or of any other nation, are Gentlemen, which are termed &amp; taken so: and that a man may bee a gentleman or a yoman according to the custome of the place where hee is, out of which he shalbe otherwise by a contrary custome.</p>

               <p>My meaning is euen so. But séeing wee haue spoken sufficiently of halfe Gentlemen, let vs speake nowe of Gentlemen which haue the two fiest kindes of gentry ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned together: to witte, that by blood; and that by vertue. The Philosophers make great account of gentry by birth, when it is accompanied with vertue, without whiche it may bée said to be dead, as a body without breath. And therefore if wée looke thorowly into the matter, wée shall finde that it happeneth seldome, that a house doth maintaine it selfe long in honour without vertue, or is able to rise to high estate &amp; dignitie. For if one of base calling, giue the beginning to gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try by the excellencie of some vertue, that is a certaine signe that vertue is the foundation of gentry, and that to maintaine gentry, it is necessarie to maintaine the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Guazzo.</speaker>
               <p>In trueth gentry is vnséemely without ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and in my opinion one that is borne a Gentleman,
<pb facs="tcp:6169:95"/>
is not woorthy of account, when hée is not indued with good conditions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>Leauing then the wrong opinion of some coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to come néere to the ancient maiestie of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> wée wil hold for certaine that gentry increaseth no lesse by the vertue of learning, then by the prowesse of arme<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. For that this saying is most true<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that gentry is the daughter of knowledge: and that knowledge doeth gentellise him that possesseth it. And therefore the science and knowledge of good letters, béeing no lesse to be estéemed of, then the knowledge of martiall feates, it is certaine that the gentry of the one, is no lesse then of the other. But for all this, wee must not thinke it sufficient for vs to bée knowen to bée but indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently learned and vertuous, but wee must indeuour to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to excellencie therein. For the more good partes bée in a man, the more Gentlemanlike hée is sayde to bée. And I can not héere but speake of the folly of some Gentlemen, who hauing nothing but gentry by byrth to bragge of, are not ashamed to say, that they are as good Gentlemen as the Emperour, as if a Gentleman could not increase in gentry: And not considering that there are degrées of gentry, as wel as of dignities and honours: and that one is so much more Gentleman * by birth * then another, by howe muche his gentry is more auncient, more renowmed, more manifest, and more mightie. Which may bée sayde, not only in respect of birth, but also in respect of vertue. And as of the twoo dogs which <hi>Lycurgus</hi> brought before the <hi>Spartanes,</hi> which though they came both of one lytter, yet the one ran to the potage pot, the other at the hare: so of two brothers, the one shalbée more gentle then the other, by howe much hee shalbe more learned, vertuous, and placed in higher degrée. And you knowe that without the spurres of preferment, to pricke men forward, the gentry of houses woulde soone decay, for no Gentleman woulde take paines to atchieue any thing woorthy of honour. To auoide which inconuenience, wee ought to haue in our mindes the saying of <hi>Galen,</hi> which is, If wée be Gentlemen, let vs not shew our selues vnworthy
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:6169:95"/>
of our house: if we come of a meane house, let vs by our déeds rayse it to renowme. But what speake I of Galen, let vs thinke of that diuine saying, <hi>You are the children of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham doe the woorkes of Abraham.</hi> Yet in my opinion it is not ynough to follow the trace of woorthie predecessours, but wee must lay before vs the noble deuise of Charles the fifth, to wit, the pillers of <hi>Hercules,</hi> and to dispose our selues to goe beyond them, and to attaine to such vertue, as may woorthily be termed heroycall. For if it be a great delight for a man to know, that from time to time out of his house, (as out of the Troyan horse) there haue yssued captaines, Colonels, and knightes, like as out of the vniuersities of <hi>Pauia, Padua,</hi> and <hi>Bologna,</hi> there come doctours of philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie, phisicke, and lawe, howe much more good shall it doe him, who may say, that he hath, according to the Prouerbe, * wings broder then the nest, * and by the excellencie of his deedes, and sufficiencie in learning and feates of armes, hath surpassed the desertes, dignities, and degrees of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessours, and alone as it were caried away the price. By the example of <hi>Augustus,</hi> who sayd, I found Rome of stones and brickes, but I haue left it of marble. Nowe to dispach this matter, these gentlemen whom I speake of, may make their boaste to haue twoo aduantages aboue gentlemen by birth onely. The first is, vertue, the other curtesie, the right ornament of a Gentleman: For of curtesie and gentlenes he is termed a gentleman.</p>

               <p>Like as in the third distillation is bestowed greater charge, and more excellent matter ariseth of it, so in these absolute gentlemen there are required greater giftes, and greater perfection they are indued withall.

ouerthrow of gentry. But you know there are many, whom their noble birth maketh ignoble: For they think, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they are borne gentlemen, they neuer need séeke other reputation or countenance. And if you doe but looke about these moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines without going any farther, you shal see some houses so ful of Gentlemen, al companions &amp; equalles in this seig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neorry, that euery one of them hath scarce a little hole to shrowd himselfe in: and they come at diuerse doores so thick as it were conies out of a Berrie. And grounding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues altogether vpon that little smoke of gentle birth, they suffer themselues to be restie as it were like Bacon with yolenesse: or else to be carried through necessitie to commit shamefull and dishonest deedes. * So that it may be sayd, that by resting in their seigneory, they loose their gentry: yea, and now and then, loose both the one and the other *. It is not long since, that a friend of mine of <hi>Moncaluo</hi> told me he sawe at the market a poore wretch, who hauing brought thither an Asse loaden with wood, when hee that would haue bought it of him, offered him lesse then he liked to sell it for, he sware by the fayth of a Gentleman that he had solde another loade for a great deale more mony, mary he woulde sell the same somewhat better cheape.</p>

               <p>I like very well of your witty distinction, but for that you said not long agoe, that curtesie &amp; gentlenes is the chiefe ornament of a gentleman, it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth now in my mind to aske you whether a Gentleman by birth, degenerating from his auncestours, &amp; from his owne nature, vsing neither curtesie nor vertue, may rightly be tearmed a Gentleman.</p>

               <p>Though curtesie necessarily appertain to a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, yet you sée it is wanting in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most part of those which are gentlemen born, which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth to passe for the reason al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redy giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.

instinct, but besides liue dissolutly, I can say no more, but that a man borne wel, &amp; liuing yll, is a monstrous thing, &amp; worthie to be abhorred. And it is a common saying, That gentry standeth the euill in as much stéed, as a looking glasse doth to a blind man. But to satisfie more fully your demau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, I wil conclude this matter with another common distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, according to which it is saide, that there are Gentlemen of Gentlemen, Gentlemen of base, and base of Gentlemen. Gentlemen of Gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> are those, who, descending of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ancestours, tread in their steps. Gentle of base, are those who extracted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> loe parentage, raise themselues to gentry by their vertue. Base of gentle are those, who degenerating from the vertue of their forefathers, are become naught, &amp; vicious. But it is high time to think of the rest of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> matters which we are to intreate of this day, &amp; to consider what is to be obserued in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> conuersation of gentlemen &amp; yome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> together.</p>

And you sée that most co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly gentlemen resort to their equals, &amp; that if they acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany with yeomen, and those which are their inferiours (if vrgent busines driue them not to it) they are discommended, and little estéemed of other Gentlemen.</p>

               <p>There are many gentlemen, who not vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding what gentry is, thinke it an euil &amp; infamous thing not to be a gentleman, &amp; therfore they flie fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it as from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plague, &amp; they think it no lesse shame to be séene in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of the baser sort, then to be taken in the common stewes: not kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> there is no more difference betwéene the gentleman &amp; the yeoman, then there is betwéen two brickes made of self same earth: whereof the one is set in the top of a towre, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the bottome of a wel. Yet there are some gentlemen of better dispositio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who frequenting for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> most part, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of gentlemen, take no scorne when occasion serueth to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the company of those which are no gentlemen. Nowe in these same differences in my iudgement, the first, by ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the bow too much, breake it in sunder, &amp; by shuting vp y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> treasure of ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie too closely, shew a kind of inciuilitie &amp; chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishnesse,
<pb facs="tcp:6169:99"/>
odious not onely to the worlde, but to GOD him selfe: for that they vouchsafe not for brothers, and compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, those whom hée auoucheth for his children. The other, in my minde doe two acts of gentrie, in that accompanying with Gentlemen they degenerate not from their kinde, and frequenting the meaner sort, they expresse that gentlenes &amp; curtesie which is proper to a Gentleman. According to that philosophical and Christian saying, That the more loftie we are placed, the more lowly wée ought to humble our selues: which is in déed, the way to ryse higher. Besides, the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man which vseth the companie of his inferiours, giueth, &amp; receiueth singuler pleasure: For that they are maruellous wel apaid when they sée a Gentleman, notwithstanding the inequalitie, which is betwéene them, to make him selfe their equall. Wherby they are induced to loue him, to honor him, and to doe him seruice: and whereby they themselues winne credite, and are the better estéemed of by their equals. But the pleasure which the gentleman receiueth is great deale more, who conuersing with other Gentlemen, is faine to frame himself ofttimes to their fancie: knowing that euery one will looke for as much preheminence euery way as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, but in consorting with his inferiours, he shalbe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> chief man amongst them, &amp; rule the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie as he list, neither shal be forced to say or do any thing co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to his minde: which libertie is seldome allowed him, being amongst his equals.</p>

wherof he is lord, where he séemeth to be a king: for that he is there obeyed, &amp; nothing done contrarie to his pleasure. Which he shall not haue in a Citie, where hee is no more then other Citizens are, &amp; where he is muche lesse respected.</p>

And there vpon wée sée that diuers Gentlemen of this Citie, are not asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be séene in the open stréet talking with diuers work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, Artificers, and handiecraftes men, for necessaries ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertaining to their house and housholde. But if necessitie constraine vs not, we ought not to admit into our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie others then those, who, though they be not Gentlemen by birth and calling, yet haue ciuilitie in their behauiour, and wit in their talke, which maketh them differ altogether from the common sort. And touching Gentlemen, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooueth them to knowe, that they are subiect to some infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, amongest the which, arrogancie is one, which is too commonly vsed, especially by Gentlemen of the first sorte, who haue nothing to stande vppon, but the good house they come of. And therefore saying aside their loftie lookes, they ought to beholde their inferiours with a more gracious eye, and to vse curtesie towardes them, which as we said before, as proper to Gentlemen, and by meanes whereof, they get the good will of their worsers. Otherwise, let them be sure they shall incense the whole people against them, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, by the common voice of the people to be verie yll spoken of. Besides, to confemne the meaner sort, may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doe a man great displeasure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as it did to a Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> of the house of the <hi>Scipioes,</hi> who, while hee laboured to be one of the Officers called <hi>Aediles,</hi> met with a country fellowe, whom hée tooke by the hande, which féeling to bée
<pb facs="tcp:6169:100"/>
rough and harde brauned, he scoffingly askt him whether hée vsed to goe with his handes or with his féete, which set the husbandman in such a rage against him, that like fire amon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest flaxe, he stirred vp the whole people against him, and so wrought the matter, that for lacke of voices, hée went without the office he stoode for, and to his great shame, hée learned howe hatefull and hurtfull a thing it is for a braue gentleman, to mocke &amp; scorne a simple soule of the country. * Wherfore let not a gentleman braue ouer those which are no gentlemen, but let him remember that his gentrie tooke beginning of one who was no gentleman. Which is giuen vs to vnderstand by the Poet, which saieth,

               </p>
               <p>Moreouer, let him remember that Gentlemen were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monished by Christ that they should not be puft vp with vain glorie, for so much as they ought to say with the common sort (<hi>Our father which art in heauen</hi>) which they can not say with a pure and vnfaigned heart; if they take not yeoman and poore men for their brothers. To be short, they ought to print this in their heartes, that no man is to be commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the gentrie of his auncestours, nor to bée reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for their basenesse. And they must knowe, that hée which despiseth the vnnoble, despiseth his first fathers, and consequently, his owne selfe. Wherefore it is the part of a Gentleman to behaue him selfe so gently and curteously in all his dooinges, * that out of his eyes, tongue, and maners, his gentlemanly minde may shewe foorth. * And he that is not willing to take this course, must content him selfe to be a Gentleman only in his owne conceite, for hée may not looke that any man els will take him so. Nowe tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the vnnoble or yeomen, they must not for all this, thinke them selues without imperfection, for many of them haue an infirmitie more gréeuous and pernicious then any before rehearsed: which is, that they will not acknowledge

               <p>A goodly matter I promise you when men will goe about (as our <hi>Boccace</hi> sayth) to make an Orenge trée of a briry bush. In my minde those which extol themselues in wóordes and bragge of their birth, rather disgrace them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues then otherwise. Like the poore drudge brought in in the Comedie, who tolde that his father was a goldsmith, and being asket what worke hee did belonging to that occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, answered, that hee set stones in morter. Or like the mule who being demaunded of his birth, and beeing ashamed to say that hee was an Asses sonne, answered, that hee was a horses cosin. But this fault of chaunging and faigning of names and callings, in my fancie is more vsed in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie then in any other. And if you marke the Spaniardes héere with vs (notwithstanding two moneths before they had not a shoe to put on their foote, and confessed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues to bée poore and néedie) yet when they haue pickt vp their crummes a little, they will bée maister one of another, and vse great honour and ceremonies, to the ende that wee should the better account of them. I thinke they durst not doe this in their owne countrie, but héere they are bolde to doe it, for that they sée it ordinarily done amongst vs: and that hée will boast himselfe to come of an auncient house, whose father neuer so much as came in place where a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman had béen. You shal sée other some, being the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of coblers &amp; pedlers, who hauing gotten a little wealth, take vpon them very higly, and become most currish and cruel.</p>

               <p>And therefore I thinke the example verie rare, yea, and singular of King <hi>Agathocles</hi>: who, being a Potters sonne, would alwayes eate his meate in earthen vessell, to the end, that hauing alwayes freshe in minde his fathers ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurenesse, hée shoulde take no pride of his owne greatnesse. But howe litle is this example followed by many riche Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santes, who are not ashamed to attire them selues like Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, to weare weapons by their side, and suche like or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, which are proper only to gentlemen: before whom they will make no curtesie to take place. And this abuse is so in vse at this day in <hi>Italy,</hi> that as well in men as wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, a man can discern no difference in estates. And you shal sée the Clownes will be as braue as the Artificers, the Artificers as the Merchantes, and the Merchantes as the Gentlemen.

So that by the garments only, you may know whether a woman be the wife of an Artificer, a Merchaunt, or Gentleman: And which is more, by the apparel, you shall knowe a difference betwéene Gentlewomen them selues, for some attire is proper to Ladies, and those that attende in the Court vppon some Quéene or Princesse, likewise to the wiues of Presidentes, Counsellours, and principal Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, which neuerthelesse is not allowed to euerie Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlewoman.</p>

               <p>Our abuse herein is in déede insupportable, and requireth that Princes should put their handes hereto, and cut the combes of these clownish cockscombes, and make them come downe from their degrée of gentrie, by forcing them to weare suche apparell as may bee at least different from Gentlemen, if they will néedes haue it as costly, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:6169:101"/>
that vnder such a maske there may be much falshood wrought, it is reasonable also, that as princes woulde finde themselues greeued with gentlemen if they would preferre themselues before them any way, so they ought not to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the honour and degree of gentrie to be disgraced by the presumption of malapert clownes. But bee it that there were no way to refourme that abuse, yet those who are gentlemen indéede, ought not to be mooued with the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but rather to laugh at it. For the Asse which put on the Lyons skin (thinking that thereby his maister woulde more respect him) was knowne for an Asse, and vsed like an Asse. Now for so much as in this matter of ciuile conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, we haue not vndertaken to speake of the manner of apparell, wee will leaue this digression, and come to conclude, that yeomen ought to know their degree, and by a certaine kinde of humilitie to shew themselues inferiours to Gentlemen in doing them reuerence: Assuring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, that as by saucy presumption they make themselues hated, so by lowly humilitie, they make themselues loued of Gentlemen.</p>
               <p>But I see well nowe wee haue stayed so long vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the discourse touching Gentlemen, that wee shall bee faigne to passe ouer lightly and briefly the conuersation of princes.</p>

               <p>I doe confesse it vnto you, neither do I maruell any thing at it, for that they were not Princes by nature, but by violence, neither had they any knowledge of Gods worde, yea &amp; were rather feared then loued: whereby they themselues were forced to feare others, &amp; to kéepe them vpon their gardes, for he y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> will be feared, must of force feare those whiche feare him. To bee short, they were vniust, disloy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, couetous, lasciuious, which rewarded the euill, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secuted the good, who for a kingdomes sake woulde haue it lawfull to breake all lawes, &amp; they were those in reproch of whom the fable is told of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lion, who entred into agréeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t with other beasts, that like good fellowes they should distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the prayes which they tooke amongst the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> al indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But afterward, euery one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming to demaund his part, he shewed them his téeth, saying, The first part is mine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am better then you: I wil haue the second, for that I am more mightie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you: the third, by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is due vnto me, for that I tooke more paine in the taking of it then you: and for the fourth, if you wil not giue it me, I will haue it spight of your téeth, &amp; so farewel frendship. And therfore it is not to bée maruelled at, that these tyrants for the most part died of some violent death, by sword, or by poyson. On the otherside you know that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> princes of our time, come to their crownes either naturally by succession, or lawefully by election,
<pb facs="tcp:6169:106"/>
that they are Christians, and indued with the knowledge of the trueth: that they are sente by God, to maintaine iustice on the earth, to defend vs from oppression, to represse the insolent, to reiecte flatterers, to respect the vertuous, to gratifie the good, and to shew themselues both in worde and déede, no lesse stayed and vnmoueable, then the corner stone, or the celestiall Pole.</p>

               <p>But for all this, it would like me well (séeing you deny not, but that there are some Princes subiecte to some infirmities) that following your course, you woulde giue some preceptes, touching the conuersation betwéene Princes and priuate persons, that our discourses may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient in no parte.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>For so much as you wil haue mee, contrarie to my determination, to speake of this matter, I will binde my selfe onely to matters of most importaunce, and I will leaue to you (who are well experienced in the dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and qualities of Princes) to giue iudgement what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth to them in euery poynt. There are then two special imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in Princes, wherby they soone come to loose ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, state, lyfe, soule, and all together. The first is, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which carieth a Prince into many inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces. And surely it is a great abuse, that Princes haue not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good letters, but are faigne to vse that shift, which an Emperour vsed, who being reproued, for that he spake contrary to the rules of Grammer: answered, that if an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour were aboue the lawes, much more was he aboue the rules of Grammer. But he shewed thereby, that hée knew not that there is nothing more behoofull for the vpholding of Empires and kingdomes then learning. For we must thinke that a Prince void of learning, must néedes either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue himself disorderly in his gouernme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: for that according to the saying of the Philosopher, ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce ioyned with puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saunce, bringeth forth madnesse: or els like an infa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, he must refer himself wholy to the discretion of others: as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Galba</hi> did, who though he were not altogether with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out learning, yet he gaue himselfe in pray to 3. of his officers com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>monly
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:6169:106"/>
called the Schoolemaisters of <hi>Galba,</hi> who nurtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him in naughtinesse, and were the cause of his ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Guaz.</speaker>
               <p>Therevpon it is saide, that as that Prince doth ill which dealeth in matters of his owne head without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise, so hée doeth scarce wel which suffreth himselfe to bee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerruled by others, and of a maister becommeth a seruant. And it is a great chaunce when the Officers sée the Prince so very a childe, but that they will conspire to cosin him, to set his honour to sale, and to make a very iest and laughing stocke of him.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>Therevppon it is sayde that a Countrie is in better case where the Prince is euil, then where his friends and officers are euil. Nowe I will speake of the second im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfection, whiche is couetousnesse, which being once entred into a Princes hearte, there is no mischiefe, cruelty, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie, or wickednesse, whiche it will not perswade him too: yea euen to make sale of Offices and of Iustice, to fyle his handes with the vile gaine of some things, whiche very pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate persons would be ashamed to medle withal, &amp; to séeke to haue about him such fetching heads, who consume the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues in a manner away, in deuising new kinds of extortion &amp; pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and to set it forth with some goodly title. So that indued with this insatiable mind, he is alway ready to procure that the exchecker may bée filled full, and the countrie emptied cleane. Of which fault it followeth, that he liuing alwayes miserable full of suspicion and feare, with a sword still han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging by a heare ouer his head, hee taketh at one tyme from his subiects libertie, from himselfe safetie, from both tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillitie?</p>

               <p>Nowe I will say you giue to an ill Prince that honour which is due vnto him, and I sée not why wée ought not as fréely to blame the il, as to commend the good, whom God long preserue. But returning to the infirmitie of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse, I thinke it much more molesteth and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth the higher sorte, then the meaner or lower: and that many Princes haue ingrauen in their heartes the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
<pb facs="tcp:6169:107"/>
of some kingdome, which when they haue obtained, yet neuerthelesse they are neuer the more satisfied, but grow stil in desire of some other: so that this saying may bée verified in them, <hi>Alexander seemeth great to the worlde, but the world seemeth small to Alexander.</hi>

               <p>In trueth <hi>Alexander</hi> ought to be counted poore, or rather wretched: for that hée which is not content with that hée hath, hath neuer a whit more, then hee, who hath nothing at all. That Prince then, which coueteth to bee well spoken off, and well thought off by his subiectes, wil take héede of those two faultes before named: and that (through his ignoraunce) when matters come in consulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hee may not sitte amongst his counsaylours, like a dumbe dogge, hée will endeuour himselfe first, to lay holde of learning and wisdome: whereof hée sheweth an vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted signe, in making account of those, who are learned and wise.</p>

                  <hi>Arestinus</hi> being askt, why fewe Princes nowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayes extende their liberalitie to those that are excellent in Poetrie or other artes, as they were wont to doe in times past: answered, for that their conscience giueth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> how vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy they are of the prayses which by Poets are giuen vnto them: and for other artes, it is dayly séene, that a man maketh no account of that, which hée knoweth not. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would in any wise haue a Prince learned, both for this and other causes, by you alleaged.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>Amongst all the learning méete for a Prince, that is the chiefest, which intreateth of matters of state and gouernment: And therefore it is sayde, that <hi>Demetrius</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted <hi>Ptolomey</hi> to reade many books pertaining to gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for that there hée should finde many thinges whiche his subiectes durst not tell him. Next, it behooueth a Prince to flye aboue all thinges, that before named, Couetousnesse, as the head of all mischiefe: not to suffer so vile and so vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy a guest to lodge in his house, and to put off a priuate person, and put on a publike, referring all his cogitations
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:6169:107"/>
to the benefit of his people. Besides this, that hée consider with himselfe, how heauily a Scepter and Crowne doe waygh, and if hee aspyre to the kingdome, in hope of a more secure life, hee immitateth him, who clymbeth to the toppe of a high hyll, in hope to saue himselfe from light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and tempest: wherevpon one with great reason tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the lyfe of a Prince, a glorious miserie: an other called it, a noble bondage: naming moreouer, a good king, a publike seruaunt. And <hi>Tiberius,</hi> (as I remember) named the Empiere, a great beast: Insomuch, that if euery man would ponder in his minde the paynes, the watchinges, the labours, the perilles, the vexations, and finally the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie charge a careful Prince is subiect to, it should not perhaps be séene, that two would striue and goe to war for one king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, but they would rather content themselues to bée ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, then to rule: whervpon a wise prince knowing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waight and daunger of so heauy a burthen, which hée alone for want of strength and knowledge is not able to beare, prouideth himselfe of officers and counsaylours, who are séene as well in ciuill, as marciall affayres, for the execution of Iustice, and conuersation of his own state: Remembring the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe, that an euill Prince, hath euill sides: that is, euill counsaylours. And therefore in making this choyce, he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth good aduisement, prouiding so néere as he can, that they be endued with honestie and learning. Wherin <hi>Phillip,</hi> king of <hi>Macedon</hi> was so presise and circumspect, that onely ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing found out, that one of his officers died his beard, he put him forth of his office: sayinge, that hee coulde not bee true and faythfull in publike matters, who wrought tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie with his owne beard. Besides, he will neuer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any thing without their aduice, especially, when iustice is to be executed in any thing: remembring how it is sayde, that when <hi>Iupiter</hi> was minded to bestowe any benefit vpon mortal creatures, he did it of himselfe: but when hee was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to doe harme, either by lightning, tempest, warre, plague, earthquake, or such like, hee assembled the rest of
<pb facs="tcp:6169:108"/>
the Gods, and wrought his vengeance by their aduise. The Emperour <hi>Antonius</hi> also vsed to say, It is more méet that I folow the counsaile of so many and such good friends, then to suffer all them to followe the fancie of mée alone. A Prince likewise must indeuour to surmount his subiects, not in ydlenesse, but in industrie and forecast. And as the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial things can not stande stil, but with continual moouing take force: so hee ought alway to exercise and trauaile him selfe in gouerning his subiects with iustice, and in looking to their welfare and profite, in such sorte, that hée fulfil the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Emperour <hi>Adrian,</hi> which was, that a kingdome was to be vsed as a thing belonging to the people, not to the Prince himselfe. Furthermore, let him be sure to get y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> good wil of his subiects, which is the sure &amp; inexpugnable stre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gth of a realme, which good wil hee shal get, folowing the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Titus Vespasianus,</hi> shewing himselfe suche towardes his subiectes, as hée coueteth to haue them towardes him. And as there is nothing more hurtfull then to bée hated, so is there nothing more helpefull then to bée loued. Which no doubt is gotten with gentlenesse and curtesie, and therefore no meruayle though that <hi>Vespasian</hi> by a generall consent were called the iewell of the world, and the darling of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, for that hée was alwayes ready to giue audience to all men, and not to suffer any to depart out of his sight vnsatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>

               <p>A prince must not only shew himself curteous, affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp; gratious, in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uersing w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his subiects, but besides, must vse his autority modestly, especially in offences co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst himselfe: wherin it ought to suffice him that he might haue taken vengeance: and to imitate those mighty &amp; stro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g beasts, which neuer turne againe against litle curres which run barking after them. Remembring the saying of <hi>Cato,</hi> that the mighty ought to vse their power moderately, that they may vse it continually. Wherevppon <hi>Traiane</hi> vsed to call the Senate Father, and him selfe their seruant.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:6169:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But to vse a worde for all, wée will say, that a good Prince ought to purchase to him selfe the name of the father of his Countrie, and not to beare himselfe otherwise towardes his subiectes, then a father doeth towards his sonnes. And for so much as out of the example of <hi>Cyrus</hi> in <hi>Xenephon,</hi> and of many others, may bée perfectly gathered the precepts pertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to a Prince, it shalbe enough for vs to adde to that wee haue alredy spoken, these thrée rules: that is, that the Prince make himselfe well thought of by speaking soberly, that hée shewe his bounty, in forbearing from polling his subiects, and his wisedome in gouerning himselfe discreetely. And that Prince which shall obserue these rules, may iustly say, that hée is the liuely Image of God: as on the contrary, hée may assure himselfe, that if no mishap befall him in his life, hée shall féele in his death this saying verified, <hi>That the mightie shalbe mightily tormented.</hi> Nowe let vs come to subiectes, and their conuersation with Princes, which (spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Princes in generall) I haue alwayes thought that subiectes ought to auoide so muche as they may, for that the good will of Princes kindleth vppon a heate, and vpon a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but it is by and by blowne foorth againe with the winde of enuy, or slaunder, which is proued by the example of <hi>Lys<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miacus</hi> and <hi>Scianus,</hi> who were so farre in fauour, the one with <hi>Alexander,</hi> the other with <hi>Tiberius</hi>: who neuerthelesse fell from their high fauour, into most foule disgrace and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction. Yea, and without fetching so farre, wée sée at this day many of the like chaunces. And though there bée nowe and then some one which mainteineth himselfe still in credite, and yet the poore soule alwayes liueth with an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet mind, and his maister doth continually loade him like a good horse, with some burden or other, and neuer leaueth vntill hée haue quite tyred him, so that hée findeth that say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing true, That whether thy Prince loue thée, or hate thée, it is all one euill. Wherevpon I thinke not amisse to followe the fable of the earthen vessell, whiche in no wise woulde haue the company of the brasen vessell. And you know wel, that in their companie a man cannot vtter his minde fréely
<pb facs="tcp:6169:109"/>
nor doe any thing contrarie to their pleasure: if hée doe, hée shalbe no friende of <hi>Caesars.</hi>

               <p>The conuersation of Princes in my iudgement is not to bée auoided, in any other respect, but for that it ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away that libertie, which is so acceptable in company, and bringeth vs into a certaine kinde of bondage, which we cannot li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e of long, but wée must consider on the other side, howe much the being in the Princes companie doeth coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance vs, howe thereby wee take away occasion for men to thinke that through basenesse of minde, wée abandon the Courte: what honour and profite wée often reape thereby, and what contentation and pleasure it is to vs to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into our Princes presence, yea, to be in the company and sight of such a Saint, as you spake of erewhile, I think most heauenly happinesse.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>You haue preuented me right: for I meant to adde, that though this conuersation be daungerous, &amp; that I myself especially neuer sought to enter into it, yet being well vsed, bringeth estimation &amp; profite. Besides, that the Prince excelling vs so much in vertue &amp; valour, by how much hée is aboue vs in degrée, it is also to be thought, that his company auaileth greatly to our edification in vertue &amp; goodnes. Like as the example of the Prince you but now mentioned, hath made such vertuous, learned, &amp; acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plished Courtiers, that there is not a more florishing or famous Court in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worlde. But you are not ignorant, that some, not vnlike the earthen vessels, are broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by leading their life with Princes, because they doe not behaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues as behooueth them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for their welfare and securitie, I briefly prescribe vnto them, that they be not puft vp with pride &amp; vaine glory, nor beare them neuer the bolder for the fauour and good counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Prince: but rather, the more they are exalted, to shew the more humilitie and reuerence.</p>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:6169:109"/>
the fauour of his Prince, must like the Beare, infane wether, be sad to think of the soule that is to come: whiche doubtfull thought, will kéepe him in such humilitie &amp; lowly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse as Princes like of.</p>

               <p>A Man cannot possibly behaue himselfe to reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently towards them. And though it be reported, that when <hi>Aristippus</hi> could not be heard of <hi>Dionisius,</hi> he threw himself down at his féet, saying, the fault is not mine, that I commit this idolatrie, but the kings, who hath his eares in his féete: yet perhaps it might haue béen replied to <hi>Aristippus,</hi> that the fault was his, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> without vsing due reuerence, he woulde be chéek mate with the Prince. But let vs end this matter, charging euery one what soeuer hée bée, to reuerence &amp; obey his Prince with all humilitie, for that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honour is not giuen to him, but to God him selfe, whose minister hée is. And what is saide of Princes, is to bée vnderstoode also of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates, not regarding that there are amongest them, whiche are vniust, cruell, partiall, ignorant, corrupt, respectours of persons &amp;c. but hauing respect to this, that they are the members of the Prince.</p>

               <p>The hurt certainely is inestimable, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth by an yll Magistrate, and therefore it is saide, That a Swoorde is put into a mad mans hand, when an office is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed vpon a naughty person, who is commonly called an Ape in purple. Whervpon we are to aduertise Magistrates, that as touching their calling, they be charitable in correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, vpright in iudging, and mercifull in punishing. And I would haue those which begin to growe proude by reason of their preferment, to remember the example of that Asse, whiche bearing the image of the Goddesse <hi>Tsides,</hi> on his backe, and séeing that euery one whiche met him, knéeled downe, and did adoration vnto him, entred into great
<pb facs="tcp:6169:110"/>
pride, and perswaded himselfe, that that honour was doone to him. Into the selfe same errour, some Magistrates fal, who séeing themselues saluted and honoured of euery man, imagine that themselues deserue that honour: Not percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing that for the most part, that honour is not done in respect of any desert of theirs, but in reuerence of the Prince, whose image they beare in their head. Nay rather Magistrates in stéede of being honoured rightly, and for their owne sakes, very often receiue (as the Prouerbe is) winde in a net: and taste meate seasoned rather with smoke then with salt.</p>

               <p>It is the saying of a wise man, That hée that sitteth worthily in the seate, doeth honour to the seate: but he that sitteth vnworthily, shameth it. And therefore a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>créete Magistrate ought not to take vpon him bigly, or to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his manners in respect of his dignitie, which hée shall not bée sure alwaies to inioy: but so to vse the matter, that hee may bée respected and honoured, not in respect of his office, but of the good partes which are in himselfe, to the ende that when hée shalbe out of office, hée may say that hée remaineth in honour, without the honour. And touching his conuersa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Prince, this is enough for him, that neither for feare nor hope, hée consent at any time to any thing that is vniust: neither to ful fill his peruerse humour any way. But if it bee a gréeuous fault to consent to the disordinate desires of the Prince, it is much worse to put naughtie mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into his head, when hée before thought not of them, and to stirre him vp to wrath, too cruelty, to vengeance, to extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and such like.</p>

               <p>Yea, but where the Prince is wise and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, you shall most commonly sée such fellowes leaue their hyre, yea and their hide too behinde them, and ende their dayes most miserably and shamefully. The last aduertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:6169:110"/>
to bée giuen to officers in respect of priuate persons is, that hée shewe himselfe in countenance seuere and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which maketh the guiltie afearde<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; the guiltlesse bolde, which commonly pleaseth the good, and displeaseth the yll, and that hée bee patient to heare euery man, but especially the poore, neither y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hee be lesse liberall of iustice, or quicke in dispatche towards them, then towardes the riche and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.

               <p>Upon the example of water and waxe, which by no meanes may bee incorporated together: I meane, vppon the too great diuersitie of their nature and disposition. You sée, that the learned are seldome or neuer in the company of the vnlearned: knowing wel that men make no account of that which they knowe not.

               <p>It is an ordinary saying, that ignorance is a kinde of folly.

I call foolishe igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, those who are not onely rude of vnderstanding, and voide of learning, but also haue in hatred and disdaine all those who are wise and learned: and like naturall fooles iudge all those to bée fooles, and scoffe at them, whiche make profession of learning: counting themselues happy in that they knowe nothing, and alwayes perseuering in that er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. By reason whereof, those who are learned, haue reason to flye their companie. For to reason of learning amongst

And it may very truely bée saide, that it is not so muche commendation to a man to bée lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as it is shame to bée vnlearned. Learning no doubt taketh from a man ignorance, learning directeth him in the course of his life, learning maketh him acceptable to all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, learning is an ornament to him in prosperitie, &amp; a comforte in aduersitie: finally, learning sifting him from the dregges and filth of the common people, serueth him as a ladder to climbe to honours and dignities, &amp; raiseth him from earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanities, to the contemplation of thinges Celestiall and diuine.</p>

But that writer was afterwards charged to haue committed the same fault, which hée found fault with in others, for that hee had set his name in the first page and beginning of his booke. Whereby it was apparantly knowne, that if hee had contemned glory in déede, as he went about to perswade others by wordes, he would haue caused his book to haue béen imprinted without his name, whiche being blazed in the fore front as it was, gaue a manifest signe, how desirous he was of glory: but <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero</hi> would neuer dissemble in that point, who in a long let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly, and earnestly requested <hi>Luceius</hi> to gratifie him in thrée thinges: The first, that he would set downe separately from his other histories, the conspiracy of <hi>Cateline,</hi> therby to giue immortall fame to his name: the second, that he woulde add some thing in respect of the fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dship which was betwene them.

               <p>Perchaunce he would not haue put himselfe in that hazard if hée had not made his account by the maiestie &amp; elegancie of his history, to make al the writers of this time afeard to write against him *. But as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world goeth, those shew themselues wise men, whiche kéepe the learned their friends, &amp; which receiue them into their fauour and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: not so much for their owne behoofe, as for the loue of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, which thing brought great glory to <hi>Alexander,</hi> to <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustus,</hi> &amp; to <hi>Mecenas,</hi> who bestowed honours &amp; maruellous rewards vpon diuers Gramarians, Orators, Poets, &amp; phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers.

I truely was euer of this minde, that as a trée, the more it is taken with fruit, the more it bendeth to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ground: so a man, the more hee is stored with learning, the more hée ought to humble himselfe. For that the grounde of true vertue is humilitie: neither is any mans name so bright, but that by pride it is obscured. * And therefore the learned ought neither to hide their knowledge without fruite, neither to shew it vpon vaine glory, but for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite and preferment. They ought also to conforme their life to their learning, for that knowledge is no better in a naughtie man, then good wine put into a mustie vessell. They ought likewise to imploy their learning to the benefite of others, and to make others partakers of it. For that a man doeth not possesse pleasantly any good thing without companie, so that they ought to take paines to instruct o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, in that they themselues are skilfull in: and they must begin to learne to teach.</p>

               <p>One saide, that as some ships séeme great vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the ryuer, whiche shewe very little vppon the Sea: so some seeme learned amongest the ignorant, whiche haue but a little when they come amongest the learned. And it can not bee denied, but that in all companies, hee ruffleth most, and taketh pleasure to vtter that which is in him, who kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth him selfe to bée chiefe and best seene in the matter whiche is spoken of. But for all that, hée must not perswade himselfe that hée ought not to heare the vnlearned speake, or to make any reckoning of them: For that there are men to bée found, who though they be not indued with learning, yet they haue a good wit of their owne, and are able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe their matters well enough, and bring them to a good ende: insomuch that many, who are learned, séeme but fooles in respect of them. Like as a scholler came to an artificer, to craue his deuotion, saying, That hée was maister in the vij. Artes.

               <p>The second aduise is, that being in the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the learned, they remember that they are vnlearned. For by that meanes they will bée wary what they speake: for it is the saying of a Philosopher, that hée neuer offendeth in those things hée knoweth not, who knoweth that he doeth not knowe them. And contrariwise hée is ignorant and doth amisse, who thinketh hée knoweth, that he doeth not know. Thirdly, they are to bée aduertised, that amongst the degrées of superioritie before spoken of, this is one, that the wise commaund ouer the ignorant: whereas it is their part to be silent without standing obstinately in contention: for that there is nothing in this world more odious then an ignorant person, which will contend with the learned, like as the Pie did with the Nightingale in musicke. And therefore as it is the part of one that is learned, gently to impart to the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that which he knoweth, so is it the part of the ignorant to ask, without hiding his ignorance, that which he knoweth not, &amp; rather to confes not to know, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to professe to know: for the one is a signe of modestie, the other of arrogancie.</p>

               <p>But perhaps it wil be a hard matter to finde in euery house so much as one, who with his wisedome is able to supply others ignorance.

For if you marke it, those whiche are vnlearned, lightly giue them selues too dishonest doings: for séeing that they cannot get the fauour of the Prince nor any preferment any way, for lacke of learning and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, they indeuour to set vp themselues, either by flatterie, either by promoting, either by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And for that wée saide but erewhile, that the learned receiueth great contentment in the companie of the vnlearned, let vs nowe consider howe little that contentment is in respect of that whiche he receiueth being in the companine of his like: For no doubt a learned man taketh much more pleasure in the company of the learned, who know, yea, and allowe better of his learning, then in the company of the ignorant, who vnderstande it not so well, neither are able to iudge of it. Besides, when hée is amongest the ignorant, hée taketh pleasure only in that which hée himselfe giueth. But when hée is with the learned, he delighteth both in it, which hée gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth, &amp; that hée receiueth: for that by turnes hée doeth both teach and learne. Moreouer, hée hath a nother contentment, to know that where is greatest conformitie in estate, in life and in study, there is greatest agréement in good will and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie, and consequently greater pleasure and contentment, * yea, that effect is bred among the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which is found amongst flowers, which being separated one from another giue a good smell, but being bounde together in a posie, they recreate the spirites a great deale more, like as it was well saide by a Poet,

What comfort euery one receiueth by it, I cannot sufficiently set foorth vnto you: for that I haue tried in my selfe and seene plainely in other <hi>Academikes,</hi> that there is not any one so afflicted with the common miseries of this citie, and with his priuate trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, who setting once his foote into the hal of the <hi>Academie,</hi> seemeth not to ariue at the hauen of tranquilitie, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not to cléere his minde of care: casting his eyes about the hall to see those goodly deuises, full of profounde myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. I may well say of my selfe, that when my bodie is shut within it, all my yrkesome thoughtes are shut out: the which attend me at the doore, and at my going out get vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon my shoulders, but touching the good which commeth
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:6169:115"/>
of his happie assembly, you may be assured in thinking to your selfe what diuersitie of learning is there handled, sometimes with publike lectures, sometimes with priuate reasoninges, which breede that delight, which commeth of giuing and receiuing, as we haue sayde before. And I may say without arrogancie that the <hi>Academie,</hi> borrowing me as it were to reade in Philosophie, hath payed mee home with interrest, béeing not onely bettered in that parte, but also moued with some knowledge in diuinitie, poetrie, and other laudable sciences, whereof I knowe I am not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together voide.</p>

               <p>I haue noted by long experience, that for the most parte those are smally accounted of, in companie, which haue bestowed al their studie in one onely profession: For drawing them once out of that, you shall finde them very sottes and fooles. Whereas on the contrary, those are very well thought of, who besides their chiefe profession are able to discourse reasonablie well and with discretion of other matters: In so much that the knowledge they shew in those bye matters, bringeth them so much the more ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, by how much they are estraunged from their ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profession. Wherefore seeing in companie wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly deuise of diuerse thinges, leaping from one matter into another, there is nothing, in my iudgement, that doeth vs more honour, or maketh vs better liked of, in good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie, then to be readie at all assayes, and haue a mouth for euery matter: to be able to perfourme which, I consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the companie of many learned men is very auaile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, like as that of the <hi>Academies</hi> is.</p>

               <p>If I should throughly satisfie your request, this day would not be enough to doe it, but to content you some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, I briefly say vnto you that these <hi>Academikes</hi> desirous to trauayle continually for their owne glorie, &amp; the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall benefite, haue proposed vnto themselues the enterprise of the sunne, which going out of the Horizon, ascendeth to the opposite of the moone, which setteth in the West, and vpon this deuise, are set these wordes. <hi>Lux indeficiens,</hi> with the name of <hi>Illustrati.</hi>. The lawes of the <hi>Academie</hi> are a great manie, but they are referred al, chiefly to the honour of God, and conseruation of the state of the <hi>Academie.</hi> In proposing of matters, in discoursing and in answering, they procéede with great respect and reuerence, without tumult, without confusion. And in giuing of voyces euery one preferreth his auncient before him, as touching priuate congregations, some are called for the creation of the Prince, Counsellours, Censors, and other Officers: who are made by secrete voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and they continue but from foure monethes to foure. Some to heare the discourse of some <hi>Academike,</hi> who lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not to doe it publikely: some to admit the newe <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dmikes</hi> that were before chosen by priuie voyces: and to to heare their spéeches, wherein they render thankes too the Prince and the <hi>Academikes.</hi> Some to conferre of those
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:6169:116"/>
thinges which are to be handled in publike: and then there are ordinarily made lectures and discourses of diuers mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and by two <hi>Academikes</hi> the compositions and workes of the <hi>Academie</hi> are redde, and afterwardes the writinges and doynges of strangers. Euery two monethes they change their Prince, and in that ceremonie, the olde Prince geueth vp his throne and deliuereth the seale of the <hi>Academie</hi> too his successour, who placing himselfe in the others seate, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth possession of the principalitie: which is done in euerie point with such state and maiestie, that I am not able to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse it. Which you may imagine by the great multitude, not onely of Citizens, but of straungers, which are present at it. Moreouer, it happeneth sometime, that some <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mike</hi> is married, and then the bride and other gentlewomen with her, are inuited to this assemblie: where shée is honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with great pompe and solemnity, with pleasant discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, with commendatorie verses, with musicke &amp; such like.

I coulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearse vnto you many other notable thinges, but I will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them for the time is short, which we haue to bestowe in other matters, wee will onelye say then, that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersation with the learned standeth vs in maruellous steede, delighteth vs muche, and is the cause of greate loue and amity.

Being the saying of a Philosopher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that a stranger when he is depriued of his friendes and parentes, is to bée pitied both of God and men.

The first is, that if the worlde coulde bee mayteined without women, wée shoulde liue like GOD himselfe. The seconde, that there is nothing in the worlde woorse then a woman, bée shee neuer so good.

But if the sharpnesse of your vnderstanding will pearce intoo the pith, you shall finde that those spéeches haue not béene vsed in reproche of women, but in reproofe of mens incontinencie, and frailtie. Who offende soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in frequenting honest women, then noghtie men? For that haunting the companie of Userers, théeues, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulterers, slaunderers, and suche like, of euill Conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation, they will not suffer themselues so soone to be temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and taken by theyr naughtinesse, as in accompanying with women.

And touching women of honestie and reputation, you know well that it is my part not only to reuerence them, but to maintaine and defende their honour and good name, both with word and with sword.

And to the ende you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine no longer in suspence, I woulde haue you with mée thinke this, that the nature of man is inclined to nothing more then to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loue of wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. But that we may not be decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, we must know, that there is one <hi>Venus</hi> in heauen, and another in earth: the latter is, the mother of wanton loue, the other, of honest affection. Wanton loue is nothing els but a passion, which blindeth the vnderstanding, peruerteth the minde, confoundeth the memory, wasteth the goods, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth the body, withereth youth, killeth age, which is the bréeder of vices, an inhabiter in idle and empty heads, which is a thing without reason, without order, &amp; without any stay, a fault proper to fooles, and which is the abridger of mans li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie.</p>

                  </gap>oule. And therfore al those who are folowers of this fo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d brutish loue, are to be admitted only into the company of incontinent and naughtie women. For they are not worthie the presence and entertainment of the honest &amp; vertuous. Next foloweth the heauenly loue, which being inamoured with the beauties of the minde, is the cause of much good, and of many commendable effectes. For it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth men affable, discréete, curteous, painfull, pacient, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant, and as a braue writer hath alredie saide, It taketh from men all rude and clownishe behauiour, it maketh them familiar in companye, pleasaunte at the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, amiable euerye waye. It is the chiefe bringer
<pb facs="tcp:6169:121"/>
in of mercy, and banisher of crueltie: it bréedeth friendship, and driueth away hatred: it is it whiche maketh a man friendly, liberall, desirous to doe well, and loth to doe yll: it is a wise guide in our trauayles, in our desires, and in our woordes: to conclude, it is the most perfect ornament of mans life. And truely, if you marke the order of feastes, playes, and merie méetinges of friendes, you will say, that all those assemblyes are colde and nothing delightfull, if there bée no women at them. For as men in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence plucke vp their spirites, and indeuour by woordes, iestures, and all other wayes to giue them to vnderstande howe desirous they are of their fauour and good will, so you ought to thinke, the obiect béeing out of their eyes, they will become carelesse, mannerlesse, and lesse readie to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable enterprises. To bée shorte, women are they whiche kéepe men waking and in continuall exercise: yea, I thinke there is no man so lazy and drouzy, but that he will open his eyes when hee heareth talke of women. And so soone as hée spyeth comming a farre of, her whom hée hath placed most néere to his heart, I warrant you he setteth his ruffes, hée turneth his Cappe and feather the right way, hée pulleth vp his cloake about his shoulders, hée standeth a tiptoe, hée sheweth a ioyfull and smyling countenaunce, and hée séemeth to be become a newe man, that hée may bee more acceptable to the sight of his mistresse, in whose presence hée chaungeth colour, and looketh pale, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son that his heart abandoneth his bodie to followe her, bée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawne as it were by it owne image.</p>

               <speaker>Guaz.</speaker>
               <p>Yea, but if this loue were so honest as you make it, you shoulde not sée men shewe them selues more
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:6169:121"/>
affectionate to the fayre then to the foule, to the yong then to the olde. But you see fewe take pleasure either in ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worne antiquities, or vnséemely deformities. By reason wherof it is easie to be knowne, that they are in loue rather with the bodie then the minde: and that their loue is earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and fleshly, which you haue alreadie banished out of good companie.</p>

               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>Women did the like for al the world towards men. For I knowe some of them whiche are very angrie in their mindes, when their chaunce is to be led in a daunce, either by a childe or an old man: whereas on the contrarie they are very glad when they haue gotten a young man by the hand.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Guaz.</speaker>
               <p>In my opinion they haue great reason in it, for that as a wise man saieth, pleasures and fauours are not to bee done either to a childe or to an olde man. For the one forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth them, the other dyeth before he haue occasion to requite them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>That is not the occasion which moueth them to doe so. And to auoide al confusion, wée must consider that loue is a desire of beautie, and that beautie is of thrée sortes, to wit: of the minde, of the body, and of the spéech. The first is discerned by the vnderstanding, the second by the eyes, the third by the eares. And therfore it is saide that the thrée gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces represent those thrée partes. So long then as loue is gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded only by the eyes, the eares, and the minde, it is without question, honest, &amp; wise louers ought to content themselues only with the fruition of those fruites, without thinking or séeking any farther. And contrariwise, it cannot bee counted honest, or deserue the name of loue, but of lust &amp; folly, when they are moued to it by any other of their senses. Nowe wée are heere to consider, that naturally our mindes are most drawen thither, where beautie doth most abound: &amp; therfore no meruaile if men for the most parte addresse themselues more willingly towards the faire &amp; yong, then the foule and olde: for that in the faire and young commonly those thrée sortes of beautie concur, of the minde, of the body, and of the
<pb facs="tcp:6169:122"/>
spéech. Whereas in the foule and the olde the beauty of the body is wanting, which in the foule fayleth by nature, and in the old by length of tyme. The same reason may serue to shewe why women in banquets and dauncing make more account of young men then of children or olde men, for that in children there is no other beautie to bee séene but that of the body: for the two other are wanting, I meane of the spéeche whiche consisteth in pleasant deuise, and fine filed talke, and of the minde whiche is shewed in discréete behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and vertuous déedes, which cannot be ripe and perfect in them. In old men is to be found only the beauty of the mind and of the spéeche, for that they haue not that of the body, which is worne away with time. But all the thrée beauties méete together for the most part in yong men. And though this inclination bee common to men and women, yet you sée some men fall in loue sooner with an olde woman then with a yong, and with a foule then with a faire: which happeneth likewise to some women, whiche beare feruent affection to some men who are altogether beréeued of the beautie of the body, and in a manner deformed, but happily indued with vertue, pleasantly conceited, and valiantly giuen. A man can not terme this folly or lacke of iudgement. For it must bée saide that a woman casting her fancy to a man of vnséemely personage, doth naturally make smal account of that outwarde beautie, and is induced to loue him in respect of the other beauties of spéech, and of the mind: and that a man doeth the like towardes a woman. Neither ought wée to thinke it straunge that some louers, the ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, they waxe the more feruently they loue one another: but we ought to iudge their loue the more perfect. For touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> woman y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> more she groweth in yeres, the more ripenesse the beauty of her mind groweth to, &amp; the older the man waxeth, the better he is able to discerne the beauties of his mistresse, whereby his loue the more increaseth. But for that my chiefe purpose is not to discourse of loue, but of the conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation with women, it shall suffice vs to knowe, that there
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:6169:122"/>
is no man in the worlde so blockishe, or suche a <hi>Cimon,</hi> who béeing in loue, calleth not his wittes about him, and waxeth not more wise: who by honest loue, and the curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and pleasaunt company of women, feeleth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe inflamed with vertuous and heauenly thoughtes, and who besides other laudable studies, is not thereby stirred vp to Poetry. And thereof it commeth, that <hi>Apollo</hi> vaunting him selfe to haue béen the cause of the worke of a certaine Poet, fraught full of amorous deuises, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> withstoode the matter, saying, That that Poet had remained mute, if her sonne had not hit him with his gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den shaft. Nowe touching the Conuersation with women, all men ought to knowe this, that they ought to doe them all the honour and reuerence possible, and that <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> made a lawe whereby hée ordeined, that in assemblies men shoulde alwayes set women aboue them. And though euerie man for the most part addresseth his seruice to some one aboue the rest, and maketh her the starre by whose a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect hée doeth direct all his doings, yet wee must not cease to shewe duetie and reuerence to all: and to shewe our selues both in déedes and woordes desirous of their good wil and fauour: taking héede howe we say or doe any thing at any time to their shame and reproch. For there is nothing that doeth more dishonour and defame a man then that: whereby hée not only looseth his reputation, but also (being in the disfauour of women) is depriued of that contentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whiche otherwise hée shoulde receiue in their company. Wherefore it is best for a man alwayes to imploye his tongue to their prayse, neuer discommending them either openly or secretly, either vppon spight or in a rage, or vppon what occasion soeuer.</p>

               <p>You know they are easie to admit an accusati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against a man, but hard to remit his offence. And as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing maketh them stomake vs more then to dispraise them, so there is nothing maketh them fancie vs more, then to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende them. And for that cause, I haue knowen many wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whiche bore more fauour to the professours of learning and Poetrie, then to any other. Furthermore, he that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenteth the companie of women, must not enter into strife, and contention with them, or séeke too get the better in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning with them. For by suche ouerthwart and obstinate dealing, there is nothing gotten at their handes, but yl wil. Therefore it is euer better rather to sooth them, then thwart them in their sayinges. But I will ende this matter, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding that a man cannot doe amisse, so that hée honour, serue, and obeye them, and omit nothing that may admit him into their fauour. On the other side, women ought to consider that men will not bée so readie to doe them ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, if in Conuersation they behaue not them selues mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly, according to their calling and kinde: and dispose not their dooinges in suche sorte, that men may like and thinke well of them. To bring whiche to passe, they are chiefly to take héede of one faulte whiche many of them hardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frame from, that is, from talking too much.</p>

of that honour and reputation shée hath: for that which chiefly maketh men haue her in admiration is, that notwithstanding the surpassing excellencie, whiche is in her, shée maketh no more account of her selfe then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther women doe: and séemeth to shewe, that shée doeth not knowe what good partes are in her. So that by this discrete humilitie, shée is exalted to higher dignitie, and men haue her in the more honour. I say then that this La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in conuersation is singuler, and meruellous: for of all the noble partes in her, you shall sée her make a most delightfull harmony. For first, to the grauenesse of her wordes, agréeth the swéetenesse of her voyce, and the honestie of her meaning: so that the mindes of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers intangled in those thrée nets, féele themselues at one instant to bee both mooued with her amiablenesse, and brideled by her honesty. Next, her talke and discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses are so delightfull, that you wyll only then beginne to bée sory, when shee endeth to speake: and wishe that shee woulde bee no more weary to speake, then you are to heare. Yea, shee frameth her iestures so discretely, that in spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kyng, shée séemeth to holde her peace, and in holding her peace, to speake. Moreouer, when shee knoweth a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perfectly, and discourseth of it discretely, to the great commendation of her witte, yet shée wyll seeme to speake of it verie doubtfully, to shewe her great modestie. She wyll also in talke cast oft times vpon a man such a swéete smyle, that it were enough to bryng him into a fooles Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radise, but that her very countenance conteineth such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinencie in it, as is sufficient to cut of all fond hope. And yet shee is so farre from solemne lookes, and distributeth the treasure of her graces, so discretely and so indifferently, that no man departeth from her vncontented. Yet for all that, you must not thinke that shee is ouer prodigall of her curtesie. For I can assure you this, she winneth moe heartes euen with very slender rewardes, then other women doe with the greatest fauours they can possibly
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:6169:124"/>
shewe, And though shee giue good countenance to all, yet shee beholdeth them most graciously, and who bestowe their tyme in learning, or otherwise most commendably: in whose company shee taketh singular pleasure, whiche is a manifest signe of her vertuous disposition. But sée the great wrong, whiche enuious fortune doeth to noble mindes, in not extolling her to the state and power of a Princes, that shée might bée able as well to preferre and bring the vertuous to promotion, as shee doeth nowe honour them, by bearing them singuler affection. I cannot sufficientlye set foorth vnto you the graces and perfections of this most perfect peece, but for conclusion I will say, that shee may well bee set for an example, whereto other women ought to conforme them selues, to bee acceptable and well thoughte of in the companie they shall come in.</p>

For as the one maketh a man strong and fierce, so the other maketh him milde and gentle: But both togeather serue both the body and minde to muche purpose.

Whereby you vnderstande that all the time whiche is chiefly spent for pleasure, ought too goe vnder the name of leasure, though there bee in it some exercise ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of minde or body. It is very true, that this leasure looseth it name, when it is turned into continuall exercise without doing ought els, so that a man cannot properly tearme leasure or pastime, the exercise of a Musitian, who all the day long doeth nothing but teache some or other to sing, or to play on some instrumentes.

That the discourse be pleasant, and of suche matters as men haue no leasure to talke of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broade while they are about their businesse: ioyning (if it may be) pleasure with profite.

And to come to the matter, I say that for the most part the domesticall conuersatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> happeneth eyther betweene the Husband and the Wife, the Father and the Sonne, the Brother and the Brother, or the Mayster and the Seruant: and of these foure pointes shall our discourse consist.</p>

               <p>I thinke this deuision ought to haue bene more large: for seing in families there are the Uncle and the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew, the Father in law and the Sonne in law, the step Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the steppe Daughter, the Coosins and Allies, me thinkes that diuision is not great ynough.</p>

               <p>As vnder the name of Father and Sonne, I haue comprehended Mother and Daughter, vnder the name of Brothers, Sisters, and of Maysters and man, Mistreis and mayde, so I include the Uncle, the Father in Law, and the Tutour, in the name of Father: and the Sonne in law, the Daughter in law, and the Pupill, in the name of Sonnes:

and the Coosins &amp; Allies, in the name of Brothers: so that in my opinion, the deuision before made, is not defectuous, neyther requireth any addition of thinges superfluous. And for so much as the cheefe conuersation commeth by meane of mariage, for that Cities cannot be without families, nor families without Husband and Wife, let vs enter into the fielde, and begin with the conuersation of the maried, seeing the cheefest honour is due vnto it, not onely for that it is first in order, but also for that there is no conuersation more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to nature, then that of the male and female.</p>

wilfully to depriue ones self of immortalitie, which he doth who seeketh not to haue wife and children: mary I say not for all that, that it behoueth euery man to haue a wife by his syde, but rather I forbid it to manye persons: for I say vnto you, that manye occasions offer themselues, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the diuell, enimy to our quiet, putteth himselfe betweene the husband and the wife, and not only maketh the maryage to haue vnhappy successe, but besides, therby bringeth many houses and families to ruine and decay.</p>

               <p>He that would make narrow search for them, might find inow of them: but I remember three of the cheifest, which are not to be concealed in this discourse. The first is, inequality betweene the maried couple, eyther in yeeres, or in calling: whereof arise so many quarrels &amp; inconuenie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I thinke it most necessary that the parties be equall.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Guaz.</speaker>
               <p>Touching the difference in yeeres, me thinks it is an vnseemely thing, to see a yong woman matched with a man that carryeth the countenaunce rather to be her father than her husband, and I am perswaded, that yong dainty damsels go as willinglye to such husbandes, as they woulde doe to their graues. For they are sure to become wydowes in their husbandes lyfe tyme: besydes that, they which haue been so matcht know, how troublesome an olde husbande is to a yong wife: yea and which is worst of al, the poore soules are in this hard plight, that what honesty so euer be in them, or what modesty so euer be in their behauiour, yet men will not stick to mutter that they are lewde and light, only by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of their husbandes white bearde. And I know not which I may count greater, of the ielousie which is entred into the husband, or of the suspicion which is giuen by the wife.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>Consider I pray you, on the other side, the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye name whiche wrinkled and toothlesse women gette in taking to husbandes young and beardlesse boyes, and tel me whether the rage of those women be not greater then the hard fortune of the other: but to make short, there can be no agreemente betweene suche contrarieties. And as <hi>Venus</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:6169:129"/>
and <hi>Saturne</hi> are at continual warre the one with the other, so the old coupled with the yong, neuer agree together. The like happeneth in mariages which are not equall in calling and condition: for so long as the one shall be nobly minded, and the other basely giuen, there can be no consent of minds, nor agreement in good will, but continuall stryfe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. Now to the former occasion of vnhappinesse in mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, I wil ad the second, which is, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the mariage is made against the will and liking of the parties: whereof I haue seene great inconuenience to grow, to the shame, reproche, &amp; to late repentaunce of the makers of such mariages: but this disliking is for the most part on the womans syde, withoute whose knowledge the mariages are talked of, and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and the dowry tolde and payde: yea they are often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyed to their husbands into stra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge countreys amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous people, before they haue any inkeling of the matter, by meanes whereof the miserable wretches, fearing the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement and rigour of their parents, are many times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to doe agaynst their mynde, and to accepte with their mouth that which they refuse with their hart.</p>

their riches: but for that we liue in a time, farre differente from those times, I thinke it not amisse to take a meane dowrye to helpe beare the charges incident to mariage, and to maintayne himselfe in that viewe whiche belongeth to his calling. But I would not haue a man doe as two olde men of this citie did, who treating a mariage betweene the Sonne of the one, and the Daughter of the other, haue stayde this fyue yeares aboute a matter of a hundreth Crownes before they will conclude it, giuing the worlde playnlye to vnderstande, that they sette more by the money, then by the affinitie.

               <p>That saying commeth from a wanton Authour, and is rather to be reprooued then followed: as there was a Gentleman of this Countrey, who would in no wyse follow it, whose happe was to haue a wife of great stature, with a prety long beard on her chinne, and so monstrous a creature euery way, that it was doubtfull whether she were a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or a tyger: and to make it short, she was such a one, that hee which should deale with her, should rather do penaunce then co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit offence: well, she passing along the strete, in the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of some fine dames, certain Gentlemen straungers stai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to view her, laughing and wondering at her: and as her husbande by chaunce passed by, one of them asked him what she was: who poore man shrinking in his neck, sayd he knew her not.</p>

And you haue often heard reported of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers women, whose singuler bewty hath brought their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandes to distruction: besides, wee muste remember how for the most parte pride and bewtye goe together: and that the wyfe of <hi>Herode</hi> though she were sober and chaste, yet by knowing the excellency of her owne bewty, she became mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueylous proude and arrogant.</p>

And though it fall out often that bewty and honesty are ioyned togither, yet it falleth out sieldome, but that exquisite bewty is had in suspition: whereby the renowne of the Husband and Wife is but sinis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly iudged of. I leaue here to speake of the Warres and destructions of diuers people and countreyes, happening on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the peerelesse bewtie of some women: and it shall suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fise to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that there is nothing in the world which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth greater discorde and trouble, then a woman when she is desired of diuers men.</p>

And therefore meane bewty is highly commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and becommeth a woman best: Whereas the extremity of fairenesse or foulenesse is much misliked, for that the one tormenteth, the other lotheth: breefely, the bewty, gestures, and countenances of a woman, ought to be such, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> most men may like of them: for therby their husbandes will be stirred vp to loue them, and bridled from louing others besides the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but if they be not amiable in other mens eyes, surelye their husbands wil neuer make great account of them: for a man careth not to possesse y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> thing, which no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> coueteth to haue.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>We ought to thinke also, that those which vse arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial means, displease God much, in altring his image, and please men neuer a whit, in going about to deceiue them. I know no man of iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but setteth more, by ods, by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall bewty that sheweth but meanly, then by a painted ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial bewty that shineth most gallantly: And I would wish those dawbed, pargetted, &amp; vermilion died faces, to consider what scoffes and mocks, men when they are by themselues, giue to those bolstred bewties, which are euer accompanied with two false perswasions: the one, that they thinke them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues made bewtiful by the force of those artificiall colours: not knowing, as a Poet sayth,
<q>
                     <l>That painting could not <hi>Hecube Helene</hi> make:</l>
                  </q>
The other, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they think those which loke on the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to take that painting for a natural colour: For I knew one once inueigh earnestly against counterfaite women, not perceiuing poore foole her owne purple died face, wheras some of the coolours stacke vppon her gorget: but such women woulde be tryed in such sort as a great many were once by an honest Matrone:
<pb facs="tcp:6169:133"/>
who at a feast making one at a game wherein euerye one by turnes commaundeth ouer all the rest, being come to her turne, she caused a basen with water to be brought, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with she forthwith washed her hands &amp; face, commaunding al the rest to do as much, wherby a great many of them with greefe &amp; shame made y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> painting run down along their chee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes. I know also a yong woman, whose face two monthes since was like a coliers, and now she ietteth vp and downe so bewhited, or rather so bepainted, that she seemeth quight an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other woman: yet when she wrieth her head a little, there appeareth such blacknesse in her neck and throate, so differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t from her face, that you would verely thinke it were a Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minges head set vpon a Moores necke.</p>

               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>If such vanities be to be borne withal in women, yet the grosse folly of some husbands is by no meanes to bee pardoned, for some seing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paintings of their wiues, alow of it, perswading themselues that it is done to please them, and they on y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other side to please their wiues, wil set y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cap awry after the cuttingest manner: some husbands also find much fault with those women that loue not to curle vp their heare roistingly, but vse to kembe it down smoothely, swearing by no beggers, that if their wife should vse it, they would wind her neck behind her, like a chicken. I knowe not which of these two sortes are the veriest fooles, the one for liking that which is euill, the other for disliking that which is good.</p>

               <p>In truth I cannot thinke well of such women, and I make account that as their colours are faygned, so also is their hart and affection, so that there is not to be looked for at their handes any pure or faythfull good will. It is to be thought that loue being naked, loueth none of this counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayte disguising, wherevpon our Gentle <hi>Tuscane,</hi> to nippe those women which are curious in such follies, and to giue a singuler commendation to madame <hi>Laure,</hi> termeth her bew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty naturall.</p>

               <p>We will maintayne then, that a woman taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way &amp; changing y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coolour and complexion which God hath giuen her, taketh vnto her that which belongeth to a harlot. And as y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is naturall is the worke of God, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which is counterfaite, is the doing of the diuel: yet I must say, that this art is not so generally to be condemned, but that it is in some cases to be tollerated: for if it be permitted to a man to seeke remedy to take away some wart, moale, spot, or suche like disgrace co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming by chaunce: by much more reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought it to be allowed to a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to correct by art any imperfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, either natural or casuall, appearing in her face. Wherfore we wil allow it lawful for a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to redresse any thing y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is amis about her by art, so y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she be necessarily driuen thereto, either by some indisposition of her body, or for the conserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her femenine state: prouided it be done so slightly, &amp; so discretely, that the artificial dealing be not seene, or beeing seene, that it be not misliked. And for so muche as wee are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that a wife is to be chosen neither to faire nor to foule, it is best we passe farther, and from henceforth indowe a Wife with that dowrye whiche maye make the mariage firme and sure. Fyrste, wee are to reprooue the abuse of men, who in choosing a Wife, vse no other order then they doe in buying a Horse, for the buyer will bee sure to prye into euerye parte, whether hee bee sounde of winde, and limme, whether he be without cracke or flawe, whether he be yong, and of good stature, whether he be well paced, and haue those outwarde markes which betoken a good Horse. I denye not, but by the lookes of a Woman, a man maye ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther somewhat of her disposition, but seing God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded vs not to iudge by the face, we must vse a more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne and commodious way.</p>

               <p>I will shew it you by the authoritie of <hi>Olympias</hi>
the mother of <hi>Alexander,</hi> whose saying, worthy to be writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in letters of Golde, was: that women are to be married with the eares, before they are with the eyes, for the custom of our countrey, not permitting men to haue free accesse to the houses where the maydes to be married are, not to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne them with familier deuice, as the fashion in <hi>Fraunce</hi> and other places is, we ought at least to deale in such sort, that out of the mouth of diuers, constant report may come to our eares of the parentage, and of the life and behauyour of them: but the greedinesse of the worlde is so great at this day, that men seeke diligently for Asses, Oxen, and Horse, of a good race, but a man careth not though his wife bee ill brought vp, and worse borne, so that she be rich ynough: but he that is wise will aboue all thinges haue a speciall regard of the conditions and qualities of his wife, and will note what the life and conuersation of her parentes is, and hath bene, remembring the saying, that the Eagle breedeth not the Pigeon, but that Cat will after kynde: And verily it is a very rare matter to see children treade out of the path of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:6169:134"/>
their parentes and predecessoures, yea I am sure you canne call to your remembraunce families, where are to be seene by succession in the Nephewes and children, the rootes of couetousnesse, beastlinesse, foolishnesse, dronkennesse, or such other faultes wherewith their parentes before them were spotted, whereby the Prouerbe is verified, that an ill byrde, layeth an ill egge, as on the other side it is sieldome seene that a good tree bringeth forth ill fruites.</p>

               <speaker>Guaz.</speaker>
               <p>I cannot hold with your opinyon in this, for dayly experience sheweth that that rule fayleth often (that I may not say is false alway) if you search the auncient histories, you will in a manner say that nature doth not her parte, for you shall finde that many vertuous men haue been begotten by vyle and foolishe fathers: and contrariwise, that many good and wise fathers haue gotten foolish and naughty chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And if we may beleeue thinges present, doe wee not see and know many very honest wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, who haue very disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest harlots to their daughters? wherefore we maye assure our selues that in mariage, fortune beareth more sway then wisedome: and that it suffiseth without beeing so curious, to crosse ones self, and so to be lead blindfolde to this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>The doubt which you haue put, no doubt is great, and worthy your wit, but though it cannot bee denyed, but that good Parentes may sometyme haue children of naugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nature, so that (as you say) my rule holdeth not, yet some say further, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it alway falleth out, that a good Father get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a naughty child, whiche agreeth with the saying, That the children of Princes and rulers are sieldome of such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as others, and yet they will not haue Nature in the faulte, but affirme contrarily, that nature doth not her duty, when a wise Father getteth a sunne like to himselfe: foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their opinion vpon certayne subtile and Philosophical reasons, which at this time I meane to omit. Now the case being so, it were good for a man that would marry, to be sure that his wife come of ill parentes, and it were best for wyse men to take heed how they marry, for feare of getting fooles
<pb facs="tcp:6169:135"/>
to their children: but I take not the matter to be so, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I answere you and those other, That nature alway ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to the best: so that of good parentes, ought naturally to come good children: and if it fall out sometyme otherwise, the fault is not to be imputed to nature. For if one looke ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisedly into the matter, he shall see, that for the most part it happeneth not by the byrth, but by the bringing vp: That is the cause that many grosse heads, by continual study become ready witted: and other who euer in their cradell are found to haue a quick wit, in processe of tyme, eyther through idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or gluttony, or some such misgouernment, become slow and dull headed. Nowe from that consideration, I woulde haue you come to this, that the Father who, through much trauayle and trouble, both of mynde and body, hath gotten wealth and honour, though he getteth children of great wit, yet he is so ouergone in fatherlye affection towardes them, that knowing he hath prouided for them sufficient to liue by at their ease, he cannot abide to see them trauaile and labour as he hath done: so that, vanquished with a certain tender af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, he suffereth them to be brought vp delicatelye, and wantonly, and is the cause, that by this ydlenesse, their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall force decayeth, and by custome and habite, is changed into another nature. Consider besides, how the children per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing themselues thus coaxed, and pampered by their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, keepe themselues, so much as they maye, oute of the dust and the sunne: neither care to apply their mynde to any commendable thing, or to seeke to get more then that liuing which their parentes haue lefte them: not vnlike the crow, which liueth only by the foode whiche other Beastes leaue. And sure there is no doubt of it, but that if they were mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left by their parentes, they would grow to be wise, and sufficient men. And thereof you see, that for the moste part, poore mens children become rich by their own study and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry, and riche waxe poore by their negligence &amp; idlenesse: which is signified vnto vs, by that pleasaunt wheele whiche turneth vp this saying: Riches breede pride, pride pouerty, pouerty humilitie, humilitie riches, &amp; riches agayne pride:
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:6169:135"/>
We will maintaine then for most true, touching generation, that as a man of men, and of beastes a beast, so of the good for the most part, is ingendered the good: but the good Father must be admonished that he trust not so much in the goodnes of his nature, that hee thinke that onelye sufficiente to keepe his children good: but beholding them with an eye ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aduised, then pitifull and fatherly, he must seeke to bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their good nature, in stirring them vp to vertuous deeds, assuring themselues that to ariue to the perfectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of vertue, it is not ynough to be wel borne, but also to be wel brought vp: whereof we will speake by and by in more conuenient place. In the meane while in the choyse of a wife we shal not doe amisse to be wel infourmed of the honesty of the mother, in hope that the daughter will follow her honest nature, and conditions, and that we shall haue much lesse paine to keepe her in her goodnesse, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> if by the peruerse nature of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther she were naturally inclined to ill: but it is not ynough to know the qualities of the mother, but we must likewise be priuy to the conditions of the Father, for that the children participate with the nature of both two: and it often falleth out, that they draw some imperfection from the one of them, which the other is cleare voyde of. And though it be expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for euery man to haue a wife that is well borne, yet I would haue Gentlemen especially take heede, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they matche only with those that come of Gentle blood: for the cauilling of <hi>Sophists</hi> against gentrie, is vayn, who hauing no regarde to thinges common, and knowne to euery man, to wit, that to haue a good race, men buy horse and dogges whiche come of a good kinde, of fruites also they make choise of the beste sortes, will not likewise consider that to a Gentleman the good byrth of his wife is auayleable, for the issue they shall haue betweene them, nor weigh how much it importeth to the children, whether their originall be barbarous or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, wherein like ignorant fellowes, they shew themselues not to know, that in generation there are certaine secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stincts of vertue and excellency, communicated by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents to the children.</p>

               <p>I presuppose that to conuerse kindly w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ones wife, it is necessary first that he bee well framed to loue her: but for that a man cannot perfectly loue y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> which he thoroughlye knoweth not, it is needefull first to learne to knowe (as we haue done) the good qualities and conditions of ones wife, and which are the good parts in a woman, whereby men are induced to loue them: likewise it is requisite for the father whiche loueth his daughter, before he marrye her, to sifte thoroughly the qualities, behauiour, and life of his sonne in lawe: for it is a true saying, that hee whiche lyghteth vppon a good sonne in lawe, getteth a good sonne: and he that meeteth with an ill one, casteth away his daughter: now the husbande knowing the goodnesse of his wyfe, being to liue with her, hee must aboue all thinges loue her moste hartelye and vnfaignedlye: for so the law of God comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.

<pb facs="tcp:6169:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>
agaynst that iealousie which maketh the husbande looke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrye, and which you ment in the beginning.

               <p>Be you therefore assured that the greatest parte of the faultes committed by the wiues, take their beginning of the fault of the husbandes: who for the most part require of their wiues an exact obseruing of the lawes of marriage, but they them selues will make no account of them. For you shall see some of them, who notwithstanding they haue receiued the companie and comfort of the woman by Gods appoyntment, yet both in wordes and deedes they will vse that rigour towardes them, and vsurpe suche superioritie ouer them, as is commonly vsed towardes slaues: And if abroade they haue receiued any iniurie, their wiues are sure to goe to wracke for it when they come home: shewing them selues cowardes towardes others, and goodly men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes their poore wiues. By reason whereof, it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayle if beeing ouercome with griefe and rage, they call the diuels to helpe them, and that at that instant some las<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciuious mates take occasion to attempt her, and hope to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine her, for that she is then ready to followe, whatsoeuer wrath and desperation shall put in her head. But on the other side, when the wife knoweth that all the beames of her husbandes loue, fayth, and loyaltie, shine vpon her only, holding her more deere then all other earthly thinges, you shal see her consume cleane away in burning flames of loue, and cast all her care in thinking and doing that whiche she knoweth will please him. And make your account, that a friend loueth not so well his friend, a brother his brother, or a childe his father, as a wife doth her husbande: Who not onely confirmeth her selfe to his will, but wholly trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth her selfe into him.

as the minde ouer the body: which are linked together by a certaine natural amitie: * but rather must consider, that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beginning man was not made of the woman, but the woman of the man, &amp; was taken, not out of the head, that she shoulde beare rule ouer man, nor out of the feete, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she should be tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den down by him, but out of the side, where is the seate of the heart, to the end he should loue her hartily, and as his owne selfe. * And as, according to the opinyon of the Astrologers, the sunne, which is Lord of the starres, goeth not about the Firmament without the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany of <hi>Mercury</hi>: so the husband, being lorde of the wife, ought not to excercise the authoritye he hath ouer her, without the company of wisdome. The hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band also must prouide to satisfie the honest desires of his wife, so that neyther by necessity, nor superfluitie, she be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked to dishonour: and he must remember, that both ease &amp; disease, make women oft times vnchaste. And for so much as many learned authours haue set downe the behauyour of the husband towards the wife, it shall suffise to say, that to beare vprightly on his side the burthen of this common honour, he must accounte of his wife as his onely treasure on earth, and the moste precious Iewell hee hath: and therefore hee must take heede, that by his faulte, the pryce of her fall not: hee must also remember, that there is nothing more due to the wife, then the faythful, honest, and louing compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye of the husbande: hee must also vouchsafe, in signe of loue, to communicate vnto her his thoughts and counsayles: for many haue found much profite by following their wiues counsayle, yea a man is happye that hath a louing wife to impart his good fortune vnto: whose harty reioysing at it, redoubleth his ioy: and if he disclose any ill happe vnto her, she lightneth his greefe, eyther by comforting him louing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye, or by helping to beare a part of it patientlye. Nowe if he chaunce to spye any faulte in his wife, eyther in wordes, gesture, or doinges, he must reprehende her, not reproche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully or angerly, but as one that is careful of her honoure, and what opinyon others carry of her: and this muste bee alwayes done secretelye betweene them two, remembe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

               <p>You put mee in mynde of that husbande, who, his wife hauing drowned her self in a Riuer, went crying along the riuer side, seeking her agaynste the streame: and being told that there was no question but that she was gone down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with the streame: Alas, sayth he, I cannot think it, for as in her life tyme she vsed to doe euery thing agaynste the hayre, so now in her death she is surely mounted against the streame.</p>

               <p>Now you haue spoken of the first disaduauntage of the wife: goe I pray you to the seconde.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>The seconde is, that albeit shee see her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande shrinke vnder his burthen, and fayle in loue and loyaltie whiche he oweth her, yet she muste not doe as hee doeth, but supplye vertuouslye his defaulte: shewing to the worlde, that for her parte, shee consenteth not that this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon honoure shoulde be violated, but making account ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that it is her part to beare all the crosse her selfe: which doing, shee shall haue double rewarde of God, and dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prayse of the worlde. Whereby you maye gather, that this honoure is more committed to the diligence and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delitye of the wife, then of the Husbande: And though the Husbande offende God as muche as the Wife, in vyolating the sacred bande of Matrimony, yet the wife ought fyrmelye to print this in her harte, and to remember alwayes, that where the husband by this fault doth, according to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men, but a little blemish his honour, the wife altogea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther looseth her good name, and remaineth spotted with such infamye, that shee can neuer recouer her honoure agayne, neyther by any repentaunce, nor by amendmente of her life: let then a wise woman stop her eares agaynst the inchaunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes of those which lie in wayte for her chastitie, and open her eyes to beholde this sentence, that
<q>
                     <l>A woman hauing lost the name of honest wife,</l>
                     <l>No more a woman counted is, nor to remaine in life.</l>
                  </q>
And to keepe more safely her honestye both in deede and in name, let her auoyd, so much as she may, the company of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that haue an ill name: who indeuour by their naughty fashions and dishonest speeches, to bring others to doe as they doe, and wish with all their hartes, that all women were like themselues: but the wife must knowe, that to fulfill the lawe which shee is bounde to, it is not sufficiente to bee ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and innocent in deede, if shee doe not likewise auoyde
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:6169:142"/>
all suspicion of dishonesty. And if shee looke well into the matter, she shall finde small difference (in respecte of the worlde) betweene beeing naughte, and beeing thoughte naughte: Wherefore a discreete woman will flie all light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and vanitie, and keepe herselfe (as it were oute of the fyre) from giuing eyther her husband or any other the least suspition in the Worlde: knowing that a woman of suspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted chastitye, liueth in this world but in a miserable case. And when shee heareth other women ill spoken of, lette her thinke in her mynde, what maye bee sayde of her, imagining with her selfe, that when a woman is once in an ill name, whether, it be deseruedlye, or without cause, shee hath much adoe to recouer agayne her honoure: shee muste not beare her selfe so boldly vppon her honest meaning, to thinke that God will alwayes holde his hand ouer her head: for hee often tymes suffereth a woman to bee reprooued wrongfully, for a punishmente of her lightnesse and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitye: by meanes whereof shee hath giuen occasyon of scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale and offence.</p>

               <p>I thinke that as I am not content to know my self to be an honest man, but I would haue the world to know it, and trie it to be so: so women mooued by the same ambition, loue to be courted and tried, that by their honest aunsweres, they may be knowne to the world to be honest women.</p>

But you made no mention how there are some women who loue to be serued of louers, and sette forth themselues by all the sleightes they can, to set their seruantes and sutors the more on edge, only to spight other women, and to make them see, that they are aswell set by as they: and that by their bewty and good grace, they can win the good will of yong men vnto them.</p>

then do it in such sort: for it is well known that there is no manne such an asse, but that continuall bobbes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulses will make him soare away: and that if in steed of their smiling countenaunces, their wanton glaunces, their yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding gestures, and other lascyuious intysing trickes, they would shew a graue looke, a demure countenance, modest gestures, and behauiour meete for an honest woman, you should see these pigeons soone forsake the doue house.</p>

            <sp>

so much, that many going about to alter the colour of their haire by naughty medecines, haue wrought their owne death: but their folly at this day is so great, that notwyth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, by meanes of such trumpery they feele their heads to ake, and their brayne to bee distempered, yet as mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therers of themselues, they will not giue ouer that shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and deadly practise: but if they knewe well, wherein consisteth the commendation and reputation of women, you knowe well they woulde not sitte vppe moste parte of the nyght, and rise betime in the morning, to bestow most part of the daye in dressing of their head, and they woulde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider with themselues that those which trim vp themselues least, are trimmed vp best.</p>

               <p>But it hapneth to them often times cleane contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: for the multitude of ornaments couereth that litle good which is in them by nature, and the glistering of their ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels, dimmeth y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> shining of their vertues, especially shining so watrishly and weakely, as they doe in suche women. But it is ordinarily seene that women, though neuer so honest, are insatiable of such trifles. Whervpon it is said, that mils and women euer want something. And some haue shewed that fond desire, not only in their life time, but at their death: As one co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded in her testament, that the iewels she vsed to weare, should be buried with her. But contrarily, the wife of <hi>Traiane</hi> wanne her selfe great commendation, by making no account of those toyes. And if honest women would adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly thinke of the matter, they should perceiue that it is not the gylt bridle that maketh the horse the better, and that
<pb facs="tcp:6169:145"/>
by reason of those affected follies, they liue with suspected honesty: which is shewed by the saying of a Poet, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending an honest woman that offended in this folly, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared her with a lewde sister of hers in this sort.</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Your sister seemeth chast, by wearing chast attire.</l>
                  <l>Although her vnchast life, hath laid her chast name in the mire.</l>
                  <l>A strumpet you to terme, a man should do you wrong:</l>

               </lg>
               <p>* I will tell you moreouer, that it is ordained by the ciuile law, that if a man offer abuse to an honest matrone, being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred like a harlot, there is no remedy against him by law. Let women therefore bee carefull to apparell themselues so modestly, that they may thereby, rather please their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, then make them iealous ouer them, in attyring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues lightly: for they ought to consider, that menne sup<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pose, that there is alway a light mind, lodged in a gorgeous body.</p>

               <p>Those fathers which set their children to thinges contrary to their disposition, are rather to be pittied then blamed, for that it happeneth commonly for lacke of taking heede: but these which thrust them into religious houses, before they are of yeares to chuse or refuse that life, are no doubt greatly to be blamed: for that they bring their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to it, eyther through feare, or through false perswasio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: which is nothing else, but to withstand the will of God, and

to take from their children that free choyse which hee of his diuine goodnesse hath promised them.

               <p>I am out of all doubte of the maruaylous effects of the Milke, and it is a thing most certayne, that if a lambe bee nourished with the Milke of a Goate, or a Kid with the milke of a yeaw, the Kid will haue a very soft hayre, and the Lambe a very rough and hayry Wooll. And therefore it is to be thought, that as the chylde, by reason of the Milke, taketh after the complexion of the Nurse, so the disposition of the mynd, followeth the complexion of the body: And therof also it commeth, that the daughters of honest women, prooue altogether vnlike them, both in body and mynde, so that to deliuer children from their mothers to Nurses, cannot be sayd to be other then a corrupting of nature. But if we shoulde make mention of this fyrste Nourriture, wee shoulde haue spoken of it then, when wee discoursed of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate

I forbore also to speake of it, for that women at this daye are so curious of their comlinesse, or rather of their vanitie, that they hadde rather peruerte the nature of their Children, then chaunge the fourme of their fyrme, harde, and rounde pappes, whereof it commeth, that the children fashioning themselues to the humoures of their Nurses, swarue from the loue and duetye whiche they owe to their mothers, and haue not in them the blood whiche mooueth them to obay or respecte them any thing, whiche is manifested by an example of a Bastard, of the house of the <hi>Gracchi,</hi> who returning from the warres, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with the spoyles of the enimie, had his mother and his Nurse comming before him, hee gaue to his Mother a Siluer ring, and to his Nourse a Coller of Golde: whiche his mother misliking with, hee tolde her she was to blame to doe so, saying: You bore me but nyne Monthes in your belly, but my Nurse kept mee with her teates the space of two yeares: That which I holde of you, is my body, whiche you gaue me scarse honestly, but that whiche I haue of her, proceeded of a pure and sincere affection: so soone as I was borne, you depriued me of your company, and banished mee your presence, but she graciously receiued mee, vanished as I was, betweene her armes, and vsed mee so well, that shee hath broughte mee to this you see.

not to respect the nature of the Nurse.

And therefore I say, that it is not ynough for the Father to know whereto the Childe is naturallye giuen, if afterwardes he indeuour not to make him the waye playne to assist him, and carefully to prouyde for all things, meete to conduct him safely to the end which he hath propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to himselfe. Another cause of this difference between the father and the chylde, is, when the Father loue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>th himselfe better then his child, keeping him with him, to play withall, without taking any keepe to set him to maisters, which may instruct him in learning, or to the court, or to those professy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons whereto he shall be most inclined: Wherein many wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy fathers greatly offende, who bearing themselues bolde vpon their goods, neuer take care to bring vp their children in learning and vertue, but suffer their wits so to be dulled with idlenesse, and gluttony, that (as the prouerbe is) They know not Chaffe from Corne, or Chalke from Cheese: and they growe to haue as good iudgement as the Asse, whiche iudged the Coockoes singing, to bee more sweete then the Nightingales.</p>

               <p>Yet for all that the abuse is such, that the rich men of our time will not haue their sonnes breake their heades with study, and in a manner mislike that they should learne to reade: for I know many of these, rich in liuing, but poore in learning, which get them into the shoppes of Merchantes and Apoticaries, to the boyes and Prentises there, to haue them write letters for them to their friendes: wherein they bewray at once both their secrets, and their ignorance: O what a goodly sight is that? but I wil not forget to tel you, that being not long since in an Aduocats study, I heard a clarke of his (who had closed vp a letter which he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for a gentleman there present) aske the gentleman the name of him to whom he should direct y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> letter, that he might put it in the superscriptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: who answered him, That he need write nothing else but, To my Gossip at <hi>Cremone</hi>: but the clarke replying that it was necessary to specifie his name<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the letter might come to the handes of his Gossip, hee sayd it was no matter for his name, it was ynough to say (to his Gossip) for that euery man knew him.</p>

These riche folke withoute learnyng, or rather bodyes without myndes, are termed by <hi>Diogenes,</hi> sheepe with golden fleeces: And therefore they ought to bee more carefull to instructe their children in learning. For as the poore are driuen to study by necessity: so the rich are hindred from
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:6169:152"/>
it by superfluitye: and they consider not vntyll it be to late, that learning is more necessarye for them, then for the poore, for that they haue more dealinges in the worlde, and haue neede of more witte to keepe their ryches, whiche, as brittle, frayle, and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, can hardlye last, without they bee conserued with the sweete syrrope of wisedome.

And those which wax proude through aboundaunce of riches, shewe themselues not to know what happened to the goord which made his bragges that he was gotten aboue the pine tree: but those which are wise, the richer they are, the better they will consider how riches are gotten with trauayle; kept with feare, and lost with greife, and, that he whiche putteth his trust in them, shall bee deceaued: for the true riches are those whiche cannot bee los<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And therfore it is so far of, that they should be dispised, that they ought to be reuerenced as much as our owne fathers. But for that there are many maisters excellent in learning, and yet lewd in life, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther must be very wary in the choise of them, least what his sonne getteth one way, he looseth another way, for hee must haue as greate care to make hym vertuous, as lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and hee muste haue more care to make hym good, then to leane hym goodes: for as one sayd. If thy sonne bee
<pb facs="tcp:6169:153"/>
wise &amp; honest, thou shalt leaue him goodes ynough: but if he be a foole, thou shalt leaue him to much: For fooles are not fit to possesse riches. Now, if the childe be not giuen to lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, the father must not fayle, continually to imploy hym some other way: for there is nothing more dangerous then an idle young manne. And as that tree which blossometh not in spring tyme, bringeth foorth no fruite in haruest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so hee shall neuer come to liue honestly, when he is a man, who is not vertuously exercised, while he is a childe: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest other occasiones of the ill successe of children, this is one, when the father is carelesse to make them in tyme raise themselues from the ground.</p>

               <p>You say very well: And if the father bee diligent to instructe his children in the law of God, hee shall get this also by it, that his children thereby will do hym the more honour and reuerence: knowing that it is Gods commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement they shoulde do so. To the former occasion of the ill successe of chyldren may bee added this, when the father setteth before them a stained and spotted glasse to looke in, that is, when he himself giueth them il example: Which the <hi>Romanes</hi> were very circumspect in, whose modesty &amp; discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was so great, that the father would neuer hath himselfe in the companye of his sonne: and it was counted a greate faulte in the father, to suffer himselfe to bee seene naked by his sonne: no marueyle then, though <hi>Cato</hi> the Censor
<pb facs="tcp:6169:154"/>
put <hi>Manlius</hi> out of the Senate, onelye for kissing his Wife in the presence of his Daughter, whereby wee maye see, that it is not ynough for the Father to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynte good Maysters ouer his Chyldren, and to see them well instructed, if aboue all thinges hee bee not cyrcumspecte to shewe himselfe suche before them, as hee wisheth to haue them to bee: for the Mayster doeth them not so muche good by his good instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as the Father doeth them harme by his euill Example, for that they are by nature lead rather to followe his steppes, then the maysters preceptes: for it is so naturall a thing for the sonne to resemble the Father in gamening, in swearing, and in other vices, that if by chaunce some childe doe not followe his Father in them, but liueth vertuouslye and honestlye, yet the worlde wyll scarse beleeue that hee doeth so, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the euill opinyon they haue conceyued of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but will rather thinke that the Chylde is heyre to his vyces, as well as to his Landes: And when they canne fynde no faulte with hym anye waye, some or other will not sticke to hitte hym in the teeth, that hee was the sonne of the naughtiest man in the worlde. Likewise, if the Father bee honest, and the sonne lewde, the Fathers good name is called in questyon, and men thinke it in a manner impossible, that the sonne shoulde treade awrye, vnlesse hee were by his Father lead a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyre. And therevppon it is thoughte, that if some <hi>Romane</hi> Gentlemen vsed too extreame seueritye towards their Chyldren, they didde it not so muche vppon the displeasure whiche they conceyued agaynste them, as for the care they hadde of their owne renowne, and the desyre to mayntayne their credite and reputation. I woulde therefore haue the Father to frame hymselfe to lyue well, and orderlye, as well for hys owne sake, as for the honoure and benefite of his Chyldren, who seeing the Uertue which shyneth in their Fathers deedes, feele themselues mooued with desyre to immitate hym,

               <p>Yea, there are some cases wherein the seelye Infantes, which haue not offended, are punished for their Fathers faulte: And thinking to my selfe, that lawe to be too rigorous, I asked one daye Mayster <hi>Frauncis Beccio</hi> the occasion whiche mooued the Emperour <hi>Iustinian</hi> to sette downe any such seuere lawe: and amongest a greate manye reasons which hee aleaged vnto mee, this was the cheefe, That the Father naturallye fearing the ill of his Children, more then of himselfe, will the better keepe himself from co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitting suche offences, whereof his children shall beare the punishment: whereby we may know, that the ill life of the father, bringeth to the Children both loffe and shame, and that he must not perswade him, that it is ynough to giue his children good counsayle, vnlesse his deedes bee agreeable thereto: for the children respecte not so muche that which the father sayth, as that which he doth: like as the Crauish somtime did, Who, his mother telling him that it was very vnseemely for him to go arsewarde; as hee die;
<pb facs="tcp:6169:155"/>
aunswered: Doe you leade mee the waye otherwyse, and you shall see I will followe you. And therefore hee that desyreth to amende his Children, muste fyrst amende hymself, and by the example of piety, charity, iustice, &amp; other vertues, make them charitable, iust, and vertuous, and when he shall walke vpright by himselfe, hee maye boldlye take vp others for haulting, lyke as <hi>Dionisius</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme didde, who taking his sonne in a faulte, sayde vnto him, Haste thou euer seene mee commit the lyke faulte?

               <p>Truly those fathers are mislyked of all men: for that withoute discretion they measure theyr children by themselues, and requyre at their handes a matter impossible, which is, to haue them be old in their youth, not suffering them to inioy in any sort, that liberty whiche is alowed to their age: And in my mynde, they deserue no other name then of Schoolemaisters, for that they cannot manner their children well, vnles they haue a rod in their hande: for if they were right fathers, they would be content that their children should learne of them, to know that the whole drift of humane lawes, is nothing else but to refraine from doing ill, &amp; to vse to do that which is good and honest, which a childe is brought to, rather by loue, than by force: but the authoritie which some ignorant fathers take vppon them, is
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:6169:156"/>
so great, that without respecting age, place, time, degree, fashion, or any thing, they wyll keepe their children vnder by force, and make them do euery thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their owne myndes, yea euen to weare their apparell after the fashion of the good men of the time past.</p>

               <p>It is most certayne, that they do amisse in that, whereby they make their children not to loue them so hartely, and to obay them rather for feare, then affection: besides, they consider not that the beating without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and the keeping them in continuall feare, is the cause that a manne cannot iudge to what manner of life they are naturally inclined. Moreouer, it dulleth their wittes, and represseth their naturall vigour, in such sort, that there is no mettall left in them, and by fearing alwayes to fayle in their doinges, they neuer but faile in them, and comming in any company, they know neyther which way to looke, nor what to do. Therefore they ought to leaue their butche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry beating, and consider rather that for the lacke of yeeres their chidren cannot haue perfect vnderstanding and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in things, wherby they are to be borne withal, when they do amisse.</p>

is a gentleman, who ought to haue in his minde that king, who comming into his sonnes lodgeing, and seing there many peeces of plate, whiche hee before had giuen him, sayd vnto him, I see well thou hast no princely minde with thee, seing of so many thinges which I gaue thee, thou hast yet made thee neuer a freind: so that the father ought to stirre vp his sonne to liberall and gentlemanly deedes: mary yet so that now and then (if he bee not otherwise affayred) hee learne to play the good husbande, and see to thinges about home: whereby he shall be able to conserue and augment his estate, and keepe himselfe from falling into decaye: hereof will rise at the least three good effectes. The first is the loue of the sonne, who seing his father withdrawe hym selfe by little and little, from the gouernment of the house, to the intent to put him in his roome, receiueth thereby won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull contentment, thinketh himselfe in his minde much bound vnto him, and not only honoureth him, but wisheth him long to liue on earth. The second, is the commodity of the sonne, who by this meanes after his fathers death, shall haue no neede to seeke counsayle and ayd at his freindes and kynsfolkes handes, nor to put himselfe to the discretion of his seruantes, for the ordering of his house, hauing by the goodnesse and foresight of his father, all thinges long before in his owne hands: so that the gouermnent of his house, shal not to be straunge or troublesome vnto him, as it is to many when they haue lost their father.

For my part I count it the greatest felicity in the world, for a man to haue about him a number of goodly children, whiche are growne to perfection, whom hee may well terme the lyght of his eyes * and the staffe of his age: * and I marueile nothing, that the most prudent dame <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelia</hi> shewed to her neighbour, that asked for her chaines &amp; iewels, her learned and vertuous children: and methinkes it must needes be a greater comfort to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> father, to see a proofe
<pb facs="tcp:6169:161"/>
of his childe, and how discreetly he can dispose of his liuing, and order his househould, then to doe it himselfe: now when the father shall be arriued to the Hauen of such happinesse, and consolation, methinkes he may ioyfully looke for the last houre of his life, and dye most contentedly.</p>

               <p>I wil do so: &amp; first I giue the father to vnderstand, that there is nothing in this worlde wherein there ought more care and diligence to be bestowed, then in the nurture and education of children, for thereof proceedeth for the most part, the maintenance or the decay of houses: That he begin betime to furnish their tender mindes with the feare and knowledge of God, of iustice, and truth, and with vertue, &amp; good conditions, in such sort, that they learne to liue as if they were stil at the point to dye: That he indeuour to keepe them in obedience, rather by loue, then by feare, and to cause them to do well, rather of their owne accord, then by others inforcement, for it is vnseemely for one that is free, to liue in bondage, neither is feare any good keeper of vertue: That in teaching them, he rather dally with them, then terrifie them, for no art or dysciplyne stycketh in the mynde firmely, whiche is driuen into it forcibly: That howe forwarde soeuer they be, yet, that he cease not to incourage and pricke them forwarde, knowing that there is no horse but needeth the spurre: That he suffer them not to be idle, but to inure them to labour, whereby they may be able to indure labour, as <hi>Milo</hi> was able to carry a bull, bicause he vsed to carry hym a calfe: That he enter not into rages with his children, for a good father vseth wisdome in steade of anger, and awardeth a smal punishment, to a great fault, and yet is not so foolishe pitifull altogether to pardon it: knowing that as by sparing the rod he may seeme to hate his
<pb facs="tcp:6169:162"/>
childe, so by wearing it the much, he may abate his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and make him dull and desperate: That hee prouide them of good maysters, and gouernoures, continually to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them, for young children must be propped vp like yong trees, least the tempest of vices either breake them, or bowe them crooked: That hee suffer them not in any wyse to haunt the company of seruantes and of the base sort, of whom they will get suche corrupt speeches and naughty conditiones, as they will neuer after forget: That he bee carefull to marke in their childehood to what kynde of life they are naturally inclined, that he may diligently sette them to it, for an vntoward beginning, hath euer an vnlucky ending: That he teach the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to gouern the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>selues w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle &amp; the spur, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is, with shame in dishonest thinges, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of glory in good thinges: That without iust occasion he vse no partialitie amongst his children, vnles he be willing to set them together by the eares: That in all his doings he shew himselfe graue and modest, and by doing well himselfe, giue his children an example to do the like, remembring how shamefull a thing it is, that he should be defiled with vyce, of whom others should take example of vertue: That in his old age, when his sonnes are men growne, through couetousnes he withhold not from them reasonable stipends to liue by, but deale so with them, that they may thinke they inioye their patrimony, no lesse in his life time, then if he were dead, otherwise in stead of honouring him, they wil wish him bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried: Finally, that he be so carefull ouer his children, that at his death, he feele not his conscience charged, in hauing to make accounte for his negligence in their behalfe: perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himselfe, that amongest all the abuses of the world (resited by an excellent authour in this sort, A wise manne without workes, an old man without religion, a yong man without obedience, a rich man without charity, a woman without honesty, a maister without vertue, a Christian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious, a poore man proud, a King vniust) there is none worse then a negligent father.

Thus sorowfull was he for the death of his sonne, notwithstanding this his sonne had before slaine his other sonne <hi>Amon,</hi> and had done hym a thousand outrages, yea &amp; finally conspired against him and his Realme: but for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> children haue no such regard to this tender loue of their parents, as they ought to haue, doing as you would haue me, I say briefly that they ought to know that the first law of nature, is to honour the father &amp; the mother: &amp; that the <hi>Spartanes</hi> vsed to do reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce to their elders, to the ende y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> being accustomed to reuerence those, whom they had nothing to do withal, they might haue their parents in the more honour &amp; reuere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce.

               <p>I see not how those extremities can be commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: for not to suffer a mayde to go abrode but once or twise in the yeare, and to keepe her inclosed like a holy relique, is the way to make her become foolish, fearefull, and oute of countenaunce in company, and more easie to bee caughte in a net: for being not accustomed to see the sunne, so soone as she sets her foote forth of the house, her eyes dazell with the least beams therof, and down she falleth backward. Now the other, which goeth abrode euery day with her mother, and haunteth feasts and banquets, melteth away like wax in the fyre: and driuing by little and little, the maidenly modestye out of her lookes &amp; gestures, there appeareth in her licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and lasciuious behauiour, so that she is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rather for a mother, then a maid: &amp; if there come no worse of it, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mother ought to assure her self of this at least, that as some folk pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by pouerty and neede, bring into the publique place the moueable goods of their house, and sel the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> for lesse then they are worth, so the mother bringing her daughter so oft abrode into publique places, maketh her therby lesse prised, &amp; worse

bestowed, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> otherwise she might be. I say nothing of those which are taught in their cha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, to read, to sing, &amp; to make verses, &amp; wil neuer come down into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kitchin, but I wil leaue that charge to the poore husbands, whose house goeth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, &amp; oft times honour too, &amp; al for hauing so learned a wife: Then if you cast your eyes vpon one of those whiche can doe nothing but spin and sow, you shal see in attire, in talk, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauiour, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> very figure of a milkmaid of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> countrey, who will haue as good a grace amongest other women, as a <hi>Satyre</hi> would haue amongst y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Nymphes.

It behoueth then, discreet fathers, who are to bestow their daughters, to measure first their degree, and disposition, and then to dispose of them accordingly: And if they thinke them fit to enter into religion, the mother, who ought to haue cheefe charge of them, must seeke to wayne them from al worldly vanities, &amp; to inure them to such since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of thoughts, and purity of life, that the vow which they shall make aboue the possibility of nature, and contrarye to the liberty allowed to mankinde, may not be so broken as it is daylye, and that that estate maye not bee polluted with whoredome and other fylthinesse, as it hath been by <hi>Rhea,</hi> that <hi>Romane</hi> vestall virgine, and diuers other <hi>Romish</hi> vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, synce her time. If they meane to bestowe them in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, the father must consider of what calling, and of what countrey his sonne in law is like to bee, and so to frame his daughter accordingly: As if he purpose to marry her into a countrey where the wiues are inioyned to a strict life, and mued vp by their husbandes like haukes, for feare least they should stoupe at some pray which they should not, then it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houeth the father to abridge her of liberty, to kepe her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in dores, &amp; to accustome her to such a hard &amp; solitary life, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it may not seeme strange or greeuous vnto her, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande shall bynde her to the like. Contrary, if she bee to bee
<pb facs="tcp:6169:165"/>
married into a more free countrey, such as <hi>Piemont</hi> is, or our <hi>Montferrat,</hi> the father must somewhat slake the bridle hand, and giue her more liberty, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> she may be fit for that life which the wiues there leade, and not taken for a foole and a clowne.</p>

               <p>The father hath not alwayes his sonne in lawe in his sleeue, mariages (as they say) are made in heauen, and are guided by destiny: so that the father may bee tenne yeeres in bruyng a matter, whiche in a moment he may bee driuen to chaunge.</p>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:6169:165"/>
to that, to make report and ieastes of the faults of other hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: it is most certayne that the Gentlewomen of <hi>Mantua</hi> which are in this citie, mocking, or at least maruayling at that fashion, yet because they will not seeme to be il brought vp, they doe nothing but runne and trot vp and downe, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming themselues to the vsage of our Countrey women.</p>

               <p>If I should set downe that, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> cause, I should be counted as very a foole as he, who being askt, why the dogge folowed his maister, answered, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> his maister went before: &amp; you might say y<hi rend="sup">t</hi>, according to the prouerbe, I went about to fil your mouth, with an empty spoone: That is, to seeme to teach, &amp; not to teach. Wherefore if you will haue me come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> right occasions of this discord, I say, I haue noted the two chiefe causes therof: the one, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fault of the fathers, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fault of the brothers. Touching y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> discord growing by the fathers fault, we haue spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> sufficiently of it already: For the other, it happeneth when brothers take more care for the partes, then for the whole body. I meane by the body, all the brothers together, &amp; by the partes, eache one of them: for that brothers stand vs in the like stead as our eyes, hands, &amp; feete do. Yea if we consider the matter thorowly, we shall finde that brothers are framed more fitly for the mutuall ayd one of another, then the partes of our bodye are: for one hande, can but helpe the other hand which is present, and one foote the other foote which is hard by it, but the mutuall aid of brothers stretcheth farther: for being far distant one from another, they cease not to succour &amp; assist one another. If then brothers, according to their nature, were cheeflye addicted to the conuersation of this body, without casting their onlye care for their owne peculier parte, there is no doubt of their brotherly loue, and good agreement together.</p>

               <p>It is true: and that is the cause there are so few brothers, which will preferre the common honoure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fite of them all, before theyr owne partyculer aduaunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that we daily see thinges common, commonly neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, whereof for the most part, groweth the decay of hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: for by the diuision of goodes, the forces of brothers are weakened, and by the diuision of hartes, they come somtymes to receiue iniuries, which euery one by himselfe hath his handes full to repulse. Which that wise Kyng shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manifestly, who by the bundell of roddes, gaue his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to vnderstande, howe inuyncible theyr force was, so long as they held together. Wherfore it is requisite, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all thinges, brothers lay before them the common ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and profite, and that all of them both in deedes and in counsaile, bee carefull for the conseruation of the honoure of their house: and let no one of them perswade himselfe by his sufficiency to supply the defects of the other, and to carye away all the honour and credite from them.</p>

And therefore they are greatly to blame, which take not as greate care of theyr Brothers as of themselues: for the brothers being, as we haue sayd, members of one bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, any one of them cannot be stayned, but the whole bodye will be spotted: and thervpon it is sayd, That the nose can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee cut without bloodying the mouth. This neerenesse
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:6169:170"/>
which ought to be between brothers, is likewise implyed in the name of brother, which in latine signifieth as it were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, to giue vs to vnderstand, that a brother to a brother is as another hymselfe: whereof I cannot at thys tyme bryng a more playne example then of a worke, or booke, whereof there are prynted in one presse diuers volumes, whiche may perhaps dyffer in the couering and outward trymming, and yet are but one thyng, hauing one selfe beginning and ending: so that the faults which are in one of these volumes, are common to them al, whereof I inferre, that the faulte which is in one brother, is common to all the rest. Wherfore for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honour of their house, brothers ought to support one another, and when the one falleth, the other ought to helpe him vp again, or else to confesse that hee hym selfe is fallen to the ground: besides, it is an vnseemly thing for a man, to see himselfe raised to high degree, and looking towardes the ground, to behould his brother in lowe estate. And a man may bee bold to say, that he which hath no care of his brothers honour, hath no care of his owne. Of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> honour, <hi>Scipio Africanus</hi> was very carefull, who hauing subdued <hi>Spaine,</hi> vanquished <hi>Annibal,</hi> &amp; conquered <hi>Afrique,</hi> thought he had done nothing, if he might not see lykewise y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honour and renown of his brother to increase: whereof hee was so iealous, that he not only procured that he was chosen by the people of <hi>Rome</hi> for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> exploit of <hi>Asia,</hi> but spoyling himselfe of his owne authority, he was content to follow his brother as a man at armes, &amp; as a priuate Souldyer, &amp; hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him openly as Captayne general, and counsayling him secretely as a brother, he wrought so with him, that pricked forward with the honour his brother did him, furthered by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> aduise he gaue him, &amp; incouraged by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> example he before had showne him, he won to himself the name of <hi>Asiatique,</hi> to his immortal glory, &amp; to the people of <hi>Romes</hi> singuler benefite.</p>

But it is a thing worthy commendation, and admiration, to see concorde and amitie surely established a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest brothers: so that none of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> go about any thing for their owne priuate co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie, but by the consent of the rest, for the common honour and aduancement of their house: and so long as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> bonde of brotherhood is kuit in such sort, it may wel be sayd that the sword which vndid <hi>Gordians</hi> knot, shal not be able to vndoo it.

<q>
                     <l>He doth not well, who doth contende,</l>

               <p>I am not of your mynde, but in my iudgement, it falleth out cleane contrary: for the reprehension whiche commeth from a foule mouthed person, hath no suche great force, and is imputed rather to his naughtye na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then to any desire hee hath to amend his Brother: but the admonition which commeth from a discreet man, is wel take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; the party which receiueth it, perswadeth himself it is vpon great cause, and of great good will that the other (being so wise &amp; so honest) vseth it. But you must not think that in making mention of a modest respecte to bee vsed, I meante a distrustfull fearefulnesse, whiche maketh vs wee dare not freelye vtter the truth, as it is the fashyon towardes Princes, Magistrates, and other our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours: for that feare woulde quite quenche out the fyre of loue which is requisit amongst right brothers: but I meant that graue and discreete maner, whereby we doe honour to others, and cause others to doe honoure to vs: which letteth vs not to reprehende our friende, muche lesse our brother.</p>

               <p>I am of y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> opinion likewise, but the very seruitude it selfe may also be a cause of this lacke of loue (y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I may not say hatred) of the seruantes towardes the maisters, for that menne serue commonly rather of necessitye, then of free will: for so muche as a manne knowing himselfe to bee borne free, when he putteth himselfe in seruice; he forceth his nature, &amp; though voluntarilye hee maketh hymselfe a prisoner, yet it is not to bee sayde, that he is content with it, or that hee hateth not him whiche keepeth him in subiection. There is no doubt of it, but thoughe he haue with his mouth promised &amp; sworne fidelitie to his Maister, yet neuerthelesse, in heart hee rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth agaynste hys seruice: And therefore it is no meruaile though he flye hys presence, and like better to be his seruant a farre of, then to doe him seruice hard by. For so long as he is out of his maysters sight, he forgetteth in a manner that he is a seruante, &amp; he thinketh he hath recouered his libertye: whereas contrariwise, when he commeth before his maister, he holdeth down his head, &amp; perswadeth himselfe he retour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to the coller like a dogge, that for a time hath been let loose.</p>

               <p>In the distinction which may bee made betweene Gentlemen Courtiers which serue Princes, and the base sort, which serue Gentlemen, is, that the chaynes or Fetters of the baser sorte, are of yron, and those of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, of Golde.</p>

And of the seruice which he doth himselfe, I haue noted two good effects, the one in that induring much trauayle both in mind and bodye, he knoweth by himselfe the payne of his owne seruauntes, by reason whereof, mooued with pittye, hee beholdeth them with a more gracious eye, and commaundeth them more gentlye. The other, for that (notwithstanding he is a greate Prince, and maye liue at his ease) his seruauntes seing him serue continuallye, are stirred vp by his example, to render him obedience, making no account of the payne whiche they indure in his seruice.</p>

               <p>To say the truth, he sheweth himselfe so worthye and courteous a prince, that he hath mo seruauntes thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Europe,</hi> then in his owne court: but these times are so vnfortunate, that there is no <hi>Homer</hi> to sette forth the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges of such an <hi>Achilles.</hi> Nowe returning to the faulte of Maysters, we will say once agayne, that those onlye knowe well how to commaund, which know well howe to obaye. And for that few maysters can doe that, there are founde al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in euerye house, maysters that are vndiscreete, proude, fantasticall, and insolent, which intreate their seruauntes no otherwise then if they were slaues, speaking imperiously to them, being not content, vnlesse they see the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tremble in their

               <p>Of such manner of dealing, it commeth that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantes, though good and sufficient, begin to growe naught, and to wax cold in goodwill, and negligent in duty towardes their maisters: but those maisters are more vndiscreet, which braule and chide with their seruauntes before straungers: whereby in my minde they make the straungers thinke they are scarse welcome to their house, and besides, spite thereby their seruants, the most of any thing in the world. For profe whereof, when a seruaunt seeketh a maister, he neuer inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth whether he be couetous or of an ill life, but whether hee be cruell and hard to please.</p>

               <p>Those are yet worse which speake to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes with their handes: who belike haue been beaten by their maysters, if they haue serued, and therefore they will reuenge it vpon their seruaunts: or else perchaunce they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade themselues that their seruauntes can not helpe them selues with their Poignadoes, whereof I saw an example at <hi>Padua.</hi> Truely there is nothing that angreth me more then that, for I cannot but thinke very ill of those which triumph tyrannously ouer their poore seruauntes, from iniuring of whom, they ought rather to abstayne, then of their equals: for that it is an act of great bountye, to keepe ones selfe from oppressing those whom he maye easily oppresse. And therfore it behoueth wise maisters to forbeare beating their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, remembring that the supreme mayster is not well pleased with him, who will take reuenge out of his handes, and not leaue the punishment of his seruauntes to his diuine pleasure, vnlesse it be for such offences as are punishable by humane lawes. Other maisters are of this fond humour, that they will haue their seruauntes vnderstande their minde, in making only a sign, as if themselues were dumme, and their seruauntes Diuiners. Some will haue their seruaunts doe three or foure thinges at once, not hauing the iudgement to consider that as a sextine sayd, a man cannot cary the crosse, and ring the bels altogether. Some are so curious, that if
<pb facs="tcp:6169:176"/>
they had a thousand seruantes, they would trouble them all, and yet would neuer be content, for that none of them all can please them, whose fashion it is euery moneth to chaunge a seruant.</p>

               <p>I holde well with your saying: I will therefore passe to the occasion of disagreement betweene the mayster and the seruaunt: which commeth by the seruauntes when they know not how to serue and obay. I meane by the vnfit to serue, not only fooles and ignoraunt Asses, but also disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and knauishe Companions, who though they are sufficient to execute any thing committed to their charge, yet they haue some notable faulte, whereby their Maysters haue iust cause to put them awaye, but it is as harde a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to fynde Seruauntes without faultes, as Dropsye Patients without thyrst: and though their faultes bee inu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable, yet their cheefest ornamentes are the three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of a Dogge, to wit, the gullet, for that they are Gluttons: barking, for that the maister canne doe nothing, but they will forthwith reporte it abrode: which the seruant in the Commedie shewed, saying hee was full of chinkes, whereat went out euery thing which entred in at his eares: next, byting, which is so naturall vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that let their mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters doe neuer so well by them, yet they wil not stick to call them vngrateful, and to speake the worst word in their belly by them: according to the saying of the Poet:
<q>
                     <l>Of sory seruantes, the worst part is the tongue.</l>

fathers: but that were a smal matter, if their faythlesnesse were not so great, that not content with fetching from their maisters in disbursing of their money, and with proloyning from them otherwise, they will not be faythfull in matters touching their honour and credite. I conclude, that their least fault deserueth the Gally, and that according to the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, We haue so many enemies as we haue seruantes: but this is to be vnderstood of the base and rascall sort, for it is not to be said, but that as there are good maisters, so likewise are there good seruantes.</p>

               <p>I thinke it well, but to take away all disorder, it is requisite that the good maister and the good seruant bee matcht together: for if they be not both good, it is hard for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> wisdome of the one, to supply the want of discretio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> other.</p>

               <p>Your demaunde putteth me in mynd of a faulte I committed the other day, in rehersing the imperfections of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: for that which I sayd vnto you generally of tollerable men, suffereth this exception, that it extendeth not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of the house, who are vnder the iurisdiction of the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of the house: who ought not to open the way of vyces to

And it may well be sayd, that the faults of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant belong in a maner to the Maister: for if the prouerbe be true, That like man like maister, and that a fishe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth first to smell at the head, there is no doubt, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> faultes of our seruantes will be layed vppon vs: eyther for that wee haue taught them, or else that wee take delighte in their naughtinesse.

               <p>The Count <hi>Hector Miroglio</hi> our friend had one day good triall of the good wit of a new come seruant: for

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Annib.</speaker>
               <p>Yet I must saye this for our Seruauntes, though they be no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Wee perceyue then (to returne to our purpose) that the Mayster who will be well serued, must not be sparing of his speeche, as well to commaunde what he wil haue done, as gently to instruct his seruaunt in that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he is ignoraunt, by telling him of his fault. Nowe hauing
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6169:180"/>
touched the commaunding of Maysters in wordes, wee must speake of their commaunding in deedes. The May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster commaundeth his Seruaunte in deedes, so often as by his example and deedes he inuiteth him to immitate him: And therefore if hee will haue his Seruaunt carefull and dilige<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e in his seruice, hee must likewise bee carefull a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute his businesse: for there is nothing that more awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Seruauntes, then the diligence of the Mayster, as on the other syde it is impossible the Seruauntes shoulde bee diligent if the mayster be negligent. And therevpon it is sayde, That the eye of the mayster fatteth the Horse: Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching whiche purpose, a Philosopher beeing askte whiche was the waye to make Laude bring good store of Corne: aunswered, For the mayster to walke often aboute it, for the Mayster must thinke that his seruauntes will thinke theyr laboure lighte, when they shall see him take suche parte as they doe. Moreouer, he must make his account that they will follow him as well in naughtinesse as in goodnesse: and therefore hee must bee as fearefull to gyue them ill example, as carefull to giue them good example. The Mayster also commaundeth well when he knoweth to vse his authoritye in suche sorte, that he is better serued with the turning of his eye, then others are with iniurious and threatning wordes, wherewith they make all the house to shake: not knowing that (as the Poet sayth)
<q>
                     <l>Great force lies hid in gentle Soueraigntie.</l>
                  </q>
And therefore let Maysters to take heede of contrarying this saying, I will not like a Lyon eyther dysorder thy househoulde seruauntes, or oppresse thy subiects. Now when the Mayster knoweth he hath gotten the loue, the fidelity, and the sufficiency of his seruant, hee must bee carefull <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> any wise to keepe that whiche he hath gotten, whereto there is nothing of more efficacy then to vse him courteously: ayding hym in hys troubles, visiting hym in hys sicknesse, and bestowing on hym when occasion shall serue, that whiche shall cost the Mayster little, and pleasure the seruant much,
<pb facs="tcp:6169:181"/>
who thinketh himselfe nothing beholding to hys May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster for the wages whiche hee hath for his trauayle, but onelye for that which he shall vppon his courtesy liberallye bestowe vpon him: And that Mayster is greatly deceyued which thinketh that his seruaunt, whether he bee a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man or not, serueth him onely for wages withoute hope of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther recompense. And therefore let him not forget to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde the good Seruaunt, and keepe him alwayes aboute him as a precious thing: remembring that the seruaunte is in a certayne sorte one part of the mayster, and that there is nothing in this life more necessary then a good Seruaunte: Wherevpon it is written, if thou haue a trusty seruaunt, let him be vnto thee as thine owne soule. Lette not the mayster take scorne to heare his reasons sometimes to consult with him, and to gouerne himselfe according to his faythfull ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uise: for that there haue been founde Seruauntes, who haue more aduaunced and profyted their maysters house, then his Brothers or Children haue. To conclude, the mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster ought to vse his seruaunt familiarlye, remembring to intreate his inferiours, as hee woulde bee intreated by his Superioures: which hauing regard vnto, hee will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes flye that detestable vice of ingratitude, and according as hee shall increase in habilitye, hee will aduaunce the state of his Seruaunt, &amp; besides his promised hyre, not faile to recompence liberally, according to his power, the long and faythfull seruice which he hath done him.</p>

               <p>I giue in charge to the seruant to learne the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this old prouerbe, It is a hard matter to make a bed for a dogge: for as a man cannot tell on which side hee will lye, when he goeth turning round being ready to lye downe, so a seruant cannot tell what seruice he may do acceptable and agreable to his maister, being for the most hart variable and diuers. And therefore the maister being of so delicate a nature, hee muste determyne wyth hymselfe to take anye
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:6169:181"/>
payne in seruice, and yet all will be scarse ynough to contene him but he must take heed of falling into the common errour of seruauntes, who like a new broome whiche sweepeth the house cleane, serue diligentlye at the first, but after growe slouthfull: That is not the waye to gette fauour, for not hee which beginneth wel, is worthy of recompense, but he which perseuereth in wel doing. And the seruaunt must thinke that his mayster will looke that he should rather heate then coole himselfe in seruice. Let the seruaunte also conforme all his thoughtes and doinges to the will and pleasure of his May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and to tye the Asse (as they say) where his maister will haue him tyed, without any contradiction: for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that spites a man more, then to see him who is bounde vnto him, and who ought to obay him, to make resistaunce a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. That he goe not about to creepe in credite with his mayster by flattery or hipocrisie, but to serue and obaye him with an vnfaigned hart: for by faygned words men ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an argument of faythlesse deedes, whereby his mayster beginneth to suspect him, &amp; to thinke that he had more neede be ouerlooked, then instructed: but in any wise lette him not forget to doe his faythfull and true intent, not for feare, but for duties sake: like as a good wise fellow answered to one, who sayd vnto him, If I take thee to my seruice, wilt thou be an honest man? Yea, sayd he, though you take me not. And for that all seruice is ill bestowed, which is not well accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that there is no greater greefe then to serue and not to please, when after certayne proofe he seeth that he cannot frame himselfe to his maysters fancy, let him seeke to depart from him rather with his good will then his ill: And when he seeth that he is in his maisters bookes, let him there holde him, saying in his heart, Happy is he, who serueth the happy, and not seeke chaunge, remembring that the rolling stone getteth no mosse. To be short, let there be no want fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d in him of loue, of reuerence, of faithfulnesse, of diligence, of warinesse, of readinesse, of secretnesse, lette him not accounte of his owne life, being in his maysters seruice, and lette him perswade with himselfe eyther (as the prouerbe is) To serue

               <p>I will not stick to giue you two receites, if one be not ynough: And for that it were to doe wrong to gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to propose vnto them those simple &amp; common things, to witte, the loue, fidelitie, diligence, and reuerence, whiche is due to Princes, I giue to a Courtyer this receyte, that the Prince being as we sayde yesterdaye, a God on earth, it behoueth him to doe him honoure as to a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred

thing: remembring that when the <hi>Athenians</hi> denyed <hi>Alexander</hi> deuine honours, this voice was hearde, though but Heathenish: <hi>Take heede least while you beholde Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, you loose the earth.</hi> Beholde the fyrst receipte. The other is compounded of two drougs which I haue fetcht out of the shoppe of an excellent Philosopher, the one of whiche or both, the Courtier vsing, may long time maintaine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his princes fauour: These are abstinence, or else su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger soppes.</p>
